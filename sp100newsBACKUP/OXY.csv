1,OXY,UPDATE 1-Occidental makes changes to incentive payment," * ROE incentives to be settled in half cash, half shares   * New CEO Chazen’s grants of incentive awards increased   (Follows alerts)	   July 19 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp , the fourth-largest U.S. oil company, said return on equity incentive awards issued in 2008 to its then CEO and CFO will be settled in 50 percent cash and 50 percent shares, instead of 100 percent in cash.	   The then Chief Executive Ray Irani and Chief Financial Officer Stephen Chazen would retain shares equivalent to the number of net after-tax shares received for at least three years.	   According to Occidental’s annual filing with regulators, it increased stockholder’s equity by 11 percent last year and 42 percent from 2008-2010, periods when Irani was the CEO.	   Irani earned $76.1 million in 2010, his last full year in the job in which he faced a shareholder revolt over pay.	   Last October, the Los Angeles-based company said executive pay would be “substantially” cut and named Chazen to succeed Irani in the CEO post. Irani is to remain executive chairman through 2014. 	   Occidental’s compensation committee also increased grants of incentive awards for Chazen from last year’s grant following his elevation as the CEO.

2,OXY,"Bahrain may delve deeper, look to Russia for gas"," DUBAI, July 21 (Reuters) - Bahrain should drill deeper for natural gas and even look as far as Russia to meet growing demand for fuel as supply talks with its neighbours stall, Bahraini energy minister Abd al-Hussein Mirza said in an interview with Kuwait news agency KUNA. 	   Demand for gas in the small Gulf oil producing country has grown rapidly in the last few years, pressing the island nation to find new sources of gas to feed its refining, power and aluminium smelting industries.	   The Bahraini government expects drilling under a new gas exploration deal with U.S.-based Occidental to start soon, but in the meantime it is considering importing gas from Turkmenistan or Russia because of slow progress on dealing with gas-rich Iran or Qatar.	  “Bahrain signed a framework agreement with Iran in 2008 and the negotiations made great strides but the negotiations were not completed due to disagreement over the price,” Mirza told KUNA, the state news agency of neighbouring Kuwait.	   “Currently negotiations are frozen,” he said, adding that Bahrain is studying the possibility of importing gas from Russia and Turkmenistan.	    Bahrain’s proven natural gas reserves stood at 7.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) at the end of 2010, according to the BP Statistical Review 2011, but the country produced only 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/day) in 2010, mostly from the Awali oil field.	    Oxy expect gross gas production from Awali to rise to 1.6 bcf/day by 2014, but Bahrain could double its gas output by delving deeper under the Gulf. 	   “A government-appointed advisory company has proposed the digging of deeper wells... for the possibility of discovering additional quantities of gas in this field,” Kuna quoted Mirza as saying.	    “It will be possible to increase energy production from gas from a summer peak of around 1.9 million cubic feet per day to 2.7 million cubic feet per day in 2024.”	  ",7212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/bahrain-gas-oxy/bahrain-may-delve-deeper-look-to-russia-for-gas-idUSL6E7IL0P420110721
3,OXY,"UPDATE 3-Occidental profit up, output ramp-up still to come"," * Q2 EPS $2.23 vs Wall St view $2.17   * Q2 sales volumes 705,000 boed vs 725,000 forecast   * Phibro had modest loss in Q2, but ahead for year -CEO   * Shares fall 1.6 pct  (Adds details on oil price, output, share price, byline)   By Braden Reddall   SAN FRANCISCO, July 26 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) posted higher-than-expected quarterly profits as oil prices hit their highest in nearly three years, but sales volumes were below forecasts due to Middle East disruptions.   The fourth-largest U.S. oil company said on Tuesday its sales fell short of its target of 725,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by 20,000 barrels due to lower output in Yemen and Qatar and due to production delays in Oman and Qatar.   But with 600,000 barrels of oil set to be produced in Iraq in the third quarter and steady growth in production at home, Occidental is targeting 725,000 boed in sales this quarter.   Second-quarter net profit rose to $1.8 billion, or $2.23 per share, from $1.1 billion, or $1.31 a share, a year earlier. That topped analysts’ average forecast of $2.17 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 34 percent to $6.17 billion, compared with an estimated $5.79 billion.   It was the first set of results since Ray Irani, after two decades as chief executive, formally gave up his title to Stephen Chazen in May. [ID:nN06183280]   Asked on the conference call about Phibro, a high-profile trading outfit Oxy bought in late 2009, Chazen said it suffered a modest second-quarter loss, but was ahead for the year.   “It’s like an NBA (basketball) game: You may as well tune in the last 30 seconds and forget the rest,” Chazen said.   The company said second-quarter oil and natural gas production rose to 715,000 boed from 701,000 a year before. That growth was due to U.S. acquisitions that helped offset the crude oil lost due to the shutdown in Libya.   U.S. output was about 424,000 boed, and Chazen forecast 430,000 to 432,000 boed for this quarter, with most of the monthly growth coming from California.   Having drilled 55 wells in the California shale last quarter, Oxy expects to drill 150 to 175 this year, using two-thirds of its 29 rigs in the state. Chazen said he would add more rigs in California if there were not the uncertainty surrounding permitting beyond this year.   The Los Angeles company has 59 U.S. rigs overall, up from 38 at the end of 2010, and expects to have 74 going by the end of this year — with all the growth outside its home state.   While the company is still always looking to buy acreage in the Permian and Williston basins, Chazen said there is little more to be had in California. “I probably don’t want to buy the land underneath the building here to drill,” he said.   The worldwide crude price averaged $103.12 per barrel in the second quarter, compared with $74.39 a year earlier, the company said, though U.S. natural gas prices showed a more modest increase of 8 cents to $4.27 per thousand cubic feet.   Occidental shares fell 1.6 percent to $105.62 by early afternoon. As of the close of trade on Monday, the stock was up 9.5 percent so far this year.

8,OXY,Exclusive: Oil trader Hall's fund down 10 percent in early Aug,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The main commodity hedge fund of Phibro oil trader Andrew Hall has lost about 10 percent of its value so far this month after oil prices plunged on global economic fears, people familiar with the fund said Thursday.  Hall’s flagship Astenbeck II fund is now flat for the year after its latest slide — and earlier slumps in May and June — wiped out gains made in the first quarter, when oil prices rallied, according to two hedge fund industry sources.  “Astenbeck is down double digits for this month — 10 percent,” said a hedge industry source who had seen a preliminary monthly report issued Wednesday by the fund. The source asked not to be identified because the information in the report was confidential.  Another source said Astenbeck — estimated to worth some $2.6 billion in late April — lost 6.4 percent in May and 3.8 percent in June. “It’s been a rough stretch for them.”  Connecticut-based Astenbeck declined comment.  On Monday, oil prices fell a whopping 6.4 percent after a downgrade in the U.S. credit rating rattled investors already fretting about the dismal labor market and stalling economy. Concerns that the euro zone debt crisis may also get out of hand added fuel to a sell-off across commodities.  On Tuesday, oil fell to around $75 a barrel after the Federal Reserve said it planned to keep U.S. interest near record low levels at least until 2013 — meaning it did not see any hope for major economic rebound until then.  U.S. crude oil ended July trading at above $95 per barrel.  Aside from commodity fund managers, others in the $2 trillion hedge fund universe have also taken a beating lately.  Billionaire trader John Paulson — famed for his big winning bets against the collapse of the U.S. housing market in 2007 and a surge in gold prices thereafter — is emerging as one of the year’s biggest losers, with his Paulson & Co firm worth just around $35 billion last week compared to around $38 billion in March.  Other major fund managers like Steve Cohen and Bill Ackman have also taken steep losses for August.  Hall, who made headlines for receiving a giant $100 million bonus while at Citigroup (C.N), also has served as the head trader at Phibro, a unit of Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N) since 2009. He is well-known as an oil bull who often takes large directional bets on the price.  The Astenbeck II fund, which is part of Hall’s Astenbeck Capital Management, gained 12 percent in 2010.

11,OXY,"ENI leads Libya oil race; Russia, China may lose out","MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Italian oil company Eni led the charge back into Libya on Monday as rebels hailing the end of Muammar Gaddafi’s rule warned Russian and Chinese firms that they may lose out on lucrative oil contracts for failing to support the rebellion.  Gaddafi’s fall will reopen the doors to Africa’s largest oil reserves and give new players such as Qatar’s national oil company and trading house Vitol the chance to compete with established European and U.S. oil majors.  “We don’t have a problem with Western countries like the Italians, French and UK companies. But we may have some political issues with Russia, China and Brazil,” Abdeljalil Mayouf, information manager at Libyan rebel oil firm AGOCO, told Reuters.  The comment signals a potential setback for those countries which opposed tough sanctions on Gaddafi or pressed for more talks and would leave European and U.S. companies to capture billions of dollars worth of oil exploration and construction contracts in the OPEC member nation.  Shares in Eni (ENI.MI), top producer in pre-war Libya, gained as much as 7 percent, as its chairman Giuseppe Recchi said Libyan oil and gas flows could restart before winter. Brent oil futures fell just over a dollar a barrel on the anticipated resumption of Libyan exports <O/R>  Shares in Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI) and France’s Total (TOTF.PA) also rose by 3-5 percent and U.S. oil and oil services firms with operations in Libya followed the trend.  Italy’s Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said staff from Eni had arrived to look into a restart of oil facilities in the country’s east.  “The facilities had been made by Italians, by (oilfield services group) Saipem (SPMI.MI), and therefore it is clear that Eni will play a No. 1 role in the future,” Frattini told state television RAI.  Before the war, Libya produced about 2 percent of global oil output or 1.6 million barrels per day and has reserves to sustain that level of production for 80 years.  A Reuters poll forecast it would take up to a year to restore Libyan output to at least 1 million bpd and up to two years to get back to pre-war levels.  “It will probably take weeks before we see exports again and it (Libya) also needs to feed the refineries. But nonetheless we need to add Libya back to OPEC spare capacity now,” said analyst Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix.  Libya’s former top oil official Shokri Ghanem, who defected from the government of Gaddafi in May, told Reuters some Libyan oil output would restart in a few months but it would take up to 18 months to return to pre-war levels.  AGOCO said that it was technically ready to start oil output in its two eastern fields, with capacity of 250,000 bpd.  “We have Libyan oil companies and can start anytime if security is approved. We can start without the foreign companies,” said Mayouf.  He added that security forces hired from the former Libyan army were already present at the fields and the firm was waiting for their clearance to start production.  About 75 Chinese companies operated in Libya before the war, involving about 36,000 staff and 50 projects, according to Chinese media.  Russian companies, including oil firms Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM) and Tatneft TATN3.MM, also had projects worth billions of dollars in Libya. Brazilian firms such as Petrobras (PETR3.SA) and construction company Odebrecht were also in business there.  “We have lost Libya completely,” Aram Shegunts, director general of the Russia-Libya Business Council, told Reuters. “Our companies will lose everything there because NATO will prevent them from doing their business in Libya.”  Apart from Italian officials, other European politicians and oil companies were more reserved in comments on Libya.  “At the moment we are not holding any bilateral talks with the (National) Transitional Council,” OMV said.  Wintershall said restarting production could be done within several weeks: “This of course depends on the state of the export infrastructure as well as a stable security situation in the country,” it said. Analysts and industry observers have said Eni and Total could emerge as the big winners in post-war Libya due to their countries’ heavy support for the rebels.  Big support from Qatar as well as oil trader Vitol, neither producers in Libya before the war, may also guarantee a chunk of reserves and influence goes to new players.  “Qatar will be a big player. Vitol might be an important one. Shell (RDSa.L) is also looking to boost its role,” said a Western risk consultant with knowledge of negotiations. Shell and Vitol declined to comment.  Most global oil majors have taken a much more cautious approach to events in Libya. BP (BP.L), which did not have production in Libya before the war, said it was planning to return to explore but gave no timeframe.  U.S. companies such as Marathon (MRO.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Hess (HES.N), Occidental (OXY.N) pulled out of Libya at the start of the year and have had little direct involvement in the events there since then.  “We have no intention of returning to Libya at the moment, as we don’t know what’s going on,” ConocoPhillips (COP.N) spokesman John McLemore told Reuters. “We are not in contact with the rebels or the Gaddafi people.”  “We are abiding by the (United Nations) sanctions and if or when they are lifted we will decide what to do.”  ",8222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-oil/eni-leads-libya-oil-race-russia-china-may-lose-out-idUSTRE77L1QU20110822

13,OXY,Factbox: Libyan oil output - how quickly can it restart?,"(Reuters) - Six months of civil war have left Libya’s oil industry in chaos, with fields that once pumped around 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) deserted and export terminals, pumping stations and pipelines damaged by fighting and sabotage.  But with opposition fighters now in control of most parts of the capital, Tripoli, and the battle for control of the country probably in its final phase, industry executives and analysts say much of the country’s oil output could be resurrected within months if peace can be established quickly.  Although it will struggle to return to pre-war output for the foreseeable future, output of as much as 1 million bpd could be feasible within months, they say.  Much will depend on the damage done to infrastructure and equipment in the last stages of the fighting between forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his 41 years of rule.  An official working for Libya’s Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO), which has been operating the Sarir and Mesla oilfields under rebel control, said on Friday that output from its area could resume within three weeks.  “Our fields are under maintenance and we’re still waiting for security,” Abdeljalil Mayouf, information manager at AGOCO told Reuters. “When the security is OK we will start. Perhaps two or three weeks after the improvement in security. In three weeks maybe.”  But even if Gaddafi avoids a bloody finish, his departure could usher in a new period of instability and uncertainty. Analysts, oil companies and Western governments worry that the opposition is riven by internal division, which could prompt new fighting after Gaddafi has been removed from power, jeopardizing both post-war recovery and the resumption of oil exports.  War and other traumas in oil producing nations have typically had a lasting impact on output. The speed of recovery in oil output depends crucially on how quickly international companies with highly evolved skills can be brought in.  Following are details of Libya’s oil industry, production and assessments of how long it may take to restore output.  * Until the beginning of this year, OPEC member Libya was the world’s 17th-largest oil producer and Africa’s third-largest. It holds the continent’s largest crude oil reserves. It sold about 85 percent of its exports to Europe.  * Oil production was equivalent to about 2 percent of global consumption, but fighting and social disruption have cut this to less than 100,000 bpd, and exports have stopped altogether. Many oilfields are dependent on foreign workers, who have almost all left the country.  * Most of Libya’s oilfields are around the Sirte Basin, which contains around 80 percent of its proven reserves and spans the front line between rebel and government forces. Many other key parts of the country’s oil industry are still held by forces loyal to Gaddafi.  * Libya has six major oil export terminals, listed with loading volumes for January from the IEA. The condition of these facilities now is not clear:  - Es Sider (447,000 bpd)  - Marsa El Brega (51,000 bpd)  - Ras Lanuf (195,000 bpd)  - Tobruk (51,000 bpd)  - Zueitina (214,000 bpd)  - Zawiyah (199,000 bpd)  - other unspecified terminals (333,000 bpd)  * Damage to infrastructure was reported to be light during the first few months of fighting as both sides hoped to take full control of the country’s oil industry. In March, officials said the terminals of Ras Lanuf, Zueitina and Es Sider had suffered only minor damage during fighting and some other oil towns had been left untouched.  * But damage has increased as fighting has continued and rebels have reported significant damage to oil infrastructure this month. It has not been possible to independently confirm reports of damage being done to oil installations, an accusation rebels have previously leveled at government forces.  * Libya’s oil industry was formerly run by the state National Oil Co, which accounted for around 50 percent of the country’s output.  * Since fighting began, the Libyan National Council, with the help of Qatar has been able to export a minimal amount of crude oil in the form of two partially laden tankers. The oil for these cargoes was reported previously to have been in storage. One of these cargoes went to a U.S. refinery and the other to Italy. No exports have been reported for several weeks.  * It is not clear how the oil industry will be structured after the war, but it may be placed in the hands of AGOCO.  * A Reuters poll of 20 analysts and industry officials last month forecast it would take up to one year to restore Libyan output to at least 1 million bpd but up to two years to get back to pre-civil war levels of 1.6 million bpd.  * The longest forecast for a full recovery of oil output came from David Wech, head of research at Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy. He said a return to full output capacity could take three to four years because significant investment in infrastructure would be necessary.  * Oil industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie said it would take around 36 months for the country to recover its full production capacity, from whenever the crisis is resolved. It estimates that substantial oil volumes could be back in the market by late 2012 if a resolution is achieved by the end of 2011. But the recovery period will extend if production remains shut-in for longer, as infrastructure continues to deteriorate.  * Samuel Ciszuk, senior Middle East & North Africa energy analyst with IHS Energy, said oil output could theoretically be restored in 18 months but that this would be the most optimistic scenario.  * “Once there is a degree of security for their personnel, it should not take too long for the oil firms to get their workers back in. If the money’s right they will go back,” said Mike Wittner, Societe Generale head of oil market research in New York. But it was difficult to assess how much damage had been done to oil facilities during the war, he said. “No one really has a clear idea of how much damage to the oil infrastructure there has been ... Anytime you shut a field down quickly and run off in a panic there will be problems.”  * Foreign oil firms, essential for the quick resumption of production, have spoken to rebels at length, but the future of existing contracts with Gaddafi’s government is uncertain.  * Italian producer ENI, present in Libya since the 1950s, is the biggest foreign oil company there, producing 270,000 boed (barrels of oil equivalent per day) in 2010. Its contracts are in force to 2042 for oil production, but it is not yet clear if they would be honored by any future government.  * The total equity share of the following foreign companies — many of which operated fields on behalf of Libya’s National Oil Co — amounted to almost 500,000 bpd before the conflict began. The legal status of contracts after the civil war will need to be clarified.

14,OXY,UPDATE 2-ENI leads Libya oil race as Gaddafi nears end," MILAN, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Libya’s leading foreign oil producer, Eni of Italy led the charge back into Libya on Monday as rebels swept into the Libyan capital Tripoli hailing the end of Muammar Gaddafi’s rule.      	   Gaddafi’s fall will reopen the doors to Africa’s largest oil reserves with new players such as Qatar’s national oil company and trading house Vitol set to compete with established European and U.S. companies.	   Shares in European companies Italy’s Eni , Austria’s OMV and France’s Total rose by 3-5 percent despite a $2 fall in the price of oil LCOc1 on hopes the firms would be able to quickly re-establish output from Libya.	   Italy’s Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said staff from Eni had arrived to look into a restart of oil facilities in the east of the country even as fighting between government troops and the rebels continued in Tripoli in the west. 	   “The facilities had been made by Italians, by (oil field services group) Saipem , and therefore it is clear that Eni will play a No. 1 role in the future,” Frattini told state TV RAI.	    OPEC member Libya was producing about 2 percent of global oil output or 1.6 million barrels per day before the war and has reserves to sustain that levels of production for 80 years.	   OMV said it was not in any talks yet.	   “We are observing the current situation and further developments very closely. At the moment we are not holding any bilateral talks with the (National) Transitional Council,” an OMV spokesman said.  	   Other major player in pre-war Libya France’s Total  and Germany’s Wintershall declined comment.	   Analysts and industry observers have said Eni and Total could emerge as the big winners in post-war Libya due to their countries’ heavy support for the rebels.	   Big support from Qatar as well as oil trader Vitol, neither producers in Libya before the war, may also guarantee a chunk of reserves and influence goes to new players.	   “Qatar will be a big player, Vitol might be an important one. Shell (RDSa.L) is also looking to boost its role,” said a Western risk consultant with knowledge of negotiations.	   Most global oil majors have taken a much more cautious approach to events in Libya with BP , not yet a producer in Libya, saying it was planning to return to explore but giving no timeframe.	   “We fully intend to return to Libya to fulfil our contract when conditions allow,” said a spokesman for BP, which did not have production in Libya before the war.	   U.S. companies such as Marathon , ConocoPhillips  , Hess , Occidental have pulled out of Libya at the start of the year and have had little direct involvement in the events there since then.	   “They are just sitting and waiting and trying to figure out who will run the place,” said the risk consultant who is advising some U.S. firms on Libya.

15,OXY,UPDATE 1-India's ONGC seeks producing assets in politically stable countries," (Adds details, quote)	   NEW DELHI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - India ONGC Videsh Ltd., the overseas investment arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp , seeks to buy producing assets in politically less risky countries like North America to cut its risk and boost output, its managing director said on Tuesday.	   The Indian government has charged ONGC with securing energy supplies overseas to fuel the country’s fast-growing economy.	  India, the world’s fourth-biggest oil importer, buys in nearly 80 percent of its oil needs as expanding refining capacity has outpaced growth in local oil output. ONGC’s local oil output has been almost stagnant in the last five years.	  “We need to spread our risk. We need to diversify into politically less risky countries like north America ... U.S.A., Canada. We would like to readjust our portfolio,” Joeman Thomas told reporters.	   He said his firm wants to acquire producing assets in two to three years. “Our short-term focus is to acquire stakes in producing properties. Our focus is more on growing production”.	   ONGC Videsh aims to source 400,000 barrels per day of crude from its assets overseas by 2020. It expects output from such assets to reach 175,000 bpd in the current financial year through to March 2012, he said.	   The social and political upheaval in the Middle East and parts of Africa has raised the risk profile of some of the hydrocarbon-rich countries.	   U.S. and Canadian companies such as Marathon , ConocoPhillips , Hess , Occidental and Suncor pulled out of Libya at the start of the year and have had little direct involvement there since then.	   Thomas said a force majeure was still continuing at its exploration block in Libya and it was still negotiating with Iran to get development rights for the Farsi block.	   India has recently managed to find a solution to a payment issue with Iran after the Reserve Bank of India scrapped a long-standing clearing house mechanism to pay for Iran oil imports under U.S. pressure.	   ONGC Videsh has a stake in 33 projects in 14 countries including Vietnam, Sudan, Colombia, Russia, Syria, Venezuela, Brazil, Myanmar, Libya and Kazakhstan.

16,OXY,"UPDATE 1-OMV sets Libya diesel delivery, in talks with NTC"," (Adds quotes and background)	   By Michael Shields	   VIENNA, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Austria’s OMV has organised an initial delivery of 30,000 tonnes of diesel fuel to Libya to support restoration of water and power supplies as it starts to rebuild ties with the country that used to provide a tenth of its oil.	   “It will arrive in Libya over the weekend,” a company spokesman said.	   OMV has a long-term stake in the crisis-hit country, with 12 exploration and production licences and Libyan petroleum contracts running up to 2032. 	   It got around a tenth of its oil from the North African country last year but production has now been cut to zero. 	   Libyan production was normal until Feb. 20 and then fell sharply as a revolt against Muammar Gaddafi’s rule broke out, forcing OMV to turn to oil from other countries. 	   OMV has said it will takes months to resume output from Libya once the civil war is over.	   OMV officials met Mahmoud Jibril, a leader of the anti-Gaddafi forces in the National Transitional Council, when he visited Vienna in June, but had not immediately started direct negotiations on resuming ties.	    “Now we are in contact with the National Transitional Council,” the spokesman said, along with partners Repsol  and Occidental who operate fields in Libya.	   “We are really confident that the contracts will remain unchanged and the signals we get from the National Transitional Council go in the same direction,” he said.

18,OXY,Iraq's Zubair oil output to peak by 2017- Eni plan," BAGHDAD, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Iraq’s Zubair oilfield will reach its peak output target of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) by the start of 2017, a development plan set by Italian oil company Eni showed.	   A group of companies led by Eni plans to spend around $18 billion to upgrade the oilfield in southern Iraq, according to a document obtained by Reuters from Iraq’s oil ministry.	   Eni’s partners in the consortium are Iraq’s Missan Oil Company, which holds 25 percent, Occidental Petroleum Corp  , with 23.44 percent, and South Korea’s Korea Gas Corp  , which owns 18.75 percent.	   Eni, the operator of Zubair, plans to spend $2.8 billion in 2011, $4.9 billion in 2012, $3.9 billion in 2013 and nearly the same in 2014, and $3.1 billion in 2015, the document showed.	   The document also showed output projections for Zubair were 300,000 bpd at end-2011, 400,000 bpd at the start of 2013, 600,000 bpd at the start of 2014, 800,000 bpd in 2015 and 1 million bpd by the start of 2016.	   The Zubair deal is one of a series that Baghdad has signed with foreign oil firms that it says could boost output capacity to Saudi Arabia’s levels of 12 million bpd by 2017. Most analysts say 6-7 million bpd is a more realistic target.	   The group won the right to develop Zubair in 2009 following the country’s first auction of oil contracts since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. The field was not initially awarded in the auction, but a deal was reached in subsequent negotiations.	   The consortium has set a production target of 1.2 million barrels per day and will be paid a remuneration fee of $2 a barrel, according to a service contract it signed with Iraq.

19,OXY,"REFILE-FEATURE-Libyan oil flows, foreign workers wait"," (Refiles to delete repeated word in first paragraph)	   This accompanies a special report on doing business in Liba. For a PDF: link.reuters.com/det83s  By Emma Farge	   BREGA, Libya, Sept 23 - Scribbled in blue marker in Arabic on the walls of Brega oil terminal is a message meant to cheer returning workers: “Gaddafi is gone and the place has been checked.”	   Oil production has restarted in some Libyan fields including Sarir in the east, but the near-deserted Sirte Oil headquarters to the east of Muammar Gaddafi’s hometown is testament to the damage the conflict has done to the country’s main industry.	   Amidst a cluster of crude oil storage tanks, gleaming white in the Mediterranean sunshine, stand at least two charred grey ones. The chimney of the site’s power plant lies in a gnarled wreck in the courtyard. A warehouse used for weapons storage, hit by a NATO bomb, is a tangle of wood and piping. A stash of missiles nestles in a petrochemical site, stored there by Gaddafi troops who took the gamble that NATO would not target expensive infrastructure.	   Brega is one of a cluster of export terminals and Libyan oil companies are eager to get things started in a business worth about $176 million a day before the conflict. The country provides only around 2 percent of global oil consumption but its oil is prized for being easy to refine.	   Some oil workers have marvelled that Gaddafi did not inflict damage to Libya’s oil facilities on the scale of Saddam Hussein, who ordered hundreds of oil wells to be set ablaze on his retreat from Kuwait in 1991. There has been no comprehensive survey of the Sirte Basin, which holds most of the country’s oil and gas fields, but interim oil minister Ali Tarhouni estimates the war has left 10-15 percent of Libya’s oil infrastructure damaged.	   Yet safety remains a major concern, especially after militia killed 17 guards at the nearby Ras Lanuf refinery last week. Brega is probably out of range of even the most sophisticated rockets in Gaddafi’s arsenal. But the area is full of mines, and the  country is strewn with ordnance dating back to World War Two.	   Fathi Issa, chairman of the management committee of state-owned Sirte Oil, waves a small, disk-shaped anti-personnel landmine the colour of milky tea, and tells reporters that 6,000 of the explosives have been found on Brega beach.	   “We will bring all the workers back when it’s safe. We find something new every day,” Issa told Reuters last week.	   According to official figures from the National Transitional Council (NTC), 40,000 mines were planted around the Brega area during this year’s fighting; Military spokesman Ahmed Bani told Reuters an order for 120,000 from Brazil was placed by a Gaddafi officer during the conflict, suggesting the number could be much higher.	   Rabea, an engineer at Sirte Oil who only gave his first name, commutes daily along the Brega-Ajdabiya coastal road which is flanked on both sides by war graves. He has tried three times to re-establish his daily routine since the war began, most recently in late August. “I’m not afraid. The mines are mostly on the seaside,” he said, his stoicism typical of many Libyans who have witnessed months of destruction.	   Foreign oil companies are less nonchalant.	   “I know many think we are cynical people ready to do anything to earn some bucks, but we are not going to put our staff in harm’s way. We need to make sure security is there,” said a French oil industry source.	   Sirte Oil’s Issa says that besides mines, one problem has been sabotage to the Hateiba gasfields south of Brega. The tops of wells were found exposed, causing gas to leak out. Looting has forced many companies to order new equipment. Ras Lanuf Oil and Gas Company, or Rasco, told Reuters its tugboats were stolen by Gaddafi troops who used them to shuttle arms back and forth to Misrata when it was under siege.	   Accommodation is hard to find. Some of the houses in the workers’ barracks are little more than sunken husks and there is no electricity or running water. An upturned armchair with loose stuffing is parked in the middle of the street. The forest-green uniform of a Gaddafi soldier lies on the pavement, apparently abandoned by its owner.	   Still, spirits are high in the oil-rich east, one of the spearheads in the military campaign against Gaddafi. For people here, restarting oil output is a matter of pride.	   In Benghazi, Yousef Mahmoud, an engineer at National Oil Company subsidiary Jowfe, has set up a society called the February 17 oil group, named to commemorate the day Libya’s revolt began. It has 4,000 members from Libyan oil firms. As well as restarting output, it wants to purge former Gaddafi sympathisers from the business and move the country’s umbrella oil firm NOC away from Tripoli and into the east.	   “We are trying to push people to work again and we try to make a full report of the damage,” he told Reuters, sitting in the Benghazi office of U.S. oil services company Baker Hughes.	   There was not an American to be seen in the office. Foreign oil firms have yet to return to Libya on a large scale. Economic sanctions have deterred many U.S. firms, even though the United Nations Security Council voted last week to ease them. Security is the main concern.	   International oil firms are accustomed to working in hostile environments, but as a general rule they rely on their own security firms. This grates with Libyans, who feel they are capable of securing the country after ousting Gaddafi. That’s turning into a sticking point in negotiations.	   “If security is good enough for Libyans it should be good enough for foreign workers,” said interim oil minister Ali Tarhouni. An oil official in the NTC told Reuters the country is planning to create a force of 5,000 security guards to secure oil and gas infrastructure.	   Libya’s oil industry can restart without foreign firms, but analysts say a speedy return to pre-war output of 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) will depend on their return.	   In the short term, the priority for oil production is to serve the Libyan people, says Abdalil Salah, an official in the oil ministry. Imports are costing Libya’s interim administration around $330 million a month. Blackouts and fuel shortages at service stations are still common.	   Abdusalam el-Madani, head of administration for German oil company Wintershall in Libya, has visited his company’s oil sites which have not been mined or suffered major damage. “The facilities are ready to start operating and our foreign workers will be back by early October,” he said.	   Official estimates of how quickly Libya’s oil output can recover range from a year to 15 months. That may seem slow, but Iraq’s oil output has yet to return to its late-1970s and early-1980s levels eight years after the fall of Saddam.	   In messages broadcast from hiding, Gaddafi has threatened devastation similar to Saddam’s in Iraq. Until he is caught or killed, that remains a risk, particularly in remote desert areas like the Sirte Basin. In theory the area is under NTC control. But soldiers from Gaddafi’s desert strongholds could easily move eastwards.	   Despite their concerns, Libya’s oil companies take solace in the preparations they made ahead of the crisis. Libya’s crude in the Sarir field is particularly waxy, and when in the late 1970s British oil major BP was forced out by nationalisation, the company told the Libyans it would leave behind clogged pipelines.	   “They said they would leave us with the world’s largest candlestick,” said Younis Feituri, a member of Agoco’s management committee for exploration and production. This time around, the company mixed the crude with a thinner variety of oil and it is now flowing to the Tobruk export terminal. “We haven’t forgotten BP’s words.”	 	  	 	 	 	 	  ",9232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/libya-oil/refile-feature-libyan-oil-flows-foreign-workers-wait-idUSL5E7KM21V20110923
20,OXY,Special Report: How to win business in Libya,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - In August, as rebels fought forces loyal to President Muammar Gaddafi, two representatives of a British business consortium took a “rather long and arduous ferry journey from Malta” to the North African country.  “To describe it as a ferry would be very polite,” according to an executive at a London-based global engineering company, whose interests the two men represented. “I think it was a trawler.”  The men traveled to Libya at the invitation of the rebel administration. Britain, along with France and the United States, had given political and military support for the uprising against Gaddafi and sponsored the rebel leadership, the National Transitional Council (NTC). This was a chance to close some deals.  “We had people on the ground in Misrata,” said the businessman, who spoke by phone on condition of anonymity. “You could still hear ordnance from the center of Misrata, so it was very much an ongoing situation. But they were already talking about training and equipping fire brigades, training and equipping police.”  The visitors keep coming. In the lobby of the Tibesti Hotel in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, opportunists mix with diplomats, journalists and aid workers. With NATO’s help, the rebels have deposed Gaddafi and now control Tripoli, the capital. Elsewhere fierce fighting continues and Gaddafi remains holed up. The country has yet to pay its workers, write a new constitution or even name a transitional government. But it is a land with deep pockets, and plenty of new friends.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron received a heroes’ welcome last week when they became the first western leaders to visit since Gaddafi’s ouster. Interim leader Abdel Jalil said the rebels’ allies could expect preferential treatment in return for their help.  It was a clear signal that countries which had not backed the NATO bombing campaign, including Russia, China and Germany, or which were slow to denounce Gaddafi, like Italy, stand to lose out.  But if French and British politicians are tallying up the contracts, business executives are leaving little to chance. Foreign companies withdrew from Libya at the outset of the NATO bombing campaign; sanctions imposed on Gaddafi’s regime since February have added to the difficulty of doing business.  Despite this, dozens of executives from France, Britain, Italy and other countries have spent months building ties with potential Libyan partners. In a country fractured by tribe and politics, they say it is relationships that will prove decisive.  The potential profits are huge. While there are pockets of damage to infrastructure and former Gaddafi command centers, the country is in far better shape than Iraq was after the fall of Saddam. At the same time, Libya needs new investment in everything from schools to services. According to the French business federation, Libya should offer around $200 billion in investment opportunities over the next 10 years. With a population of just over 6 million and Africa’s largest oil reserves, it has plenty to spend. Up to $170 billion worth of frozen Gaddafi-era assets alone should help pay for reconstruction.  Here’s how companies are playing this new front in the latest scramble for Africa.  Western firms, including trading houses Vitol, Trafigura and Gunvor have already been busy. A London-based team for Vitol sold oil products to the rebels in large volumes as early as April, and helped ship their first crude oil cargo. Trafigura expressed interest, although it is not clear if any deals were concluded.  France landed executives in Benghazi in June and July, according to Michel Casals, head of the Franco-Libyan Chamber of Commerce.  “There’s no point going when people are not ready, but we can’t go in six months when everybody has already been there,” says Thierry Courtaigne, director general of French business lobby Medef International, which represents the interests of France’s top companies overseas.  At the same time, some firms remain wary of doing business with the rebels in case they break international sanctions. Though those sanctions are now easing — Europe and the United Nations have eased theirs — U.S. firms in particular are hesitant. One engineering executive expressed optimism about the potential in Libya “once things get going” and said he has been attempting to rekindle old relationships. But he, along with another U.S. company official, said sanctions left them unsure about how much they can do. Many told Reuters they are waiting for guidance from Washington.  There are ways to work as you wait. These include employing free agents known as “fixers,” who offer on-the-ground intelligence, security, networking, and deniability in case of a legal challenge. Often former British military men, fixers are widely used by companies in resource-rich countries with weak governments. In Libya you can find a small community of them in hotels like the Tibesti — Benghazi’s main networking hub.  One of their number is a former senior officer in Britain’s SAS special forces. In his early 60s and with a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, John Holmes is often seen with two other men at the Tibesti. He spends much of his time in the lobby, trying to catch the ear of NTC officials who could help open doors in the oil sector.  NTC officials say Holmes is working on behalf of British firm Heritage Oil, trying to finance field security and maintenance work in return for a stake in the country’s oil production. He refused to talk to Reuters, describing himself as a private person. Heritage also declined to comment on whether the firm had hired him. “They’ve been very aggressive, going out on a limb,” said one rival.  Others are more approachable, but still decline to be identified or say who they are working for because of the sensitive nature of their work. Many fixers are fresh from similar assignments in Iraq. One, dressed in desert camouflage and smoking British Lambert & Butler cigarettes, was responsible for liaising with local Iraqis. He doesn’t speak Arabic but says he has a mantra for life: have respect, be courteous and don’t promise something you can’t deliver.  The job includes giving clients a flavor of local conditions and pinpointing opportunities. In one memo sent by a fixer and seen by Reuters, the author details meetings with Libyan officials and discusses a strategy for gaining access to remote oil facilities to check out the wartime damage. Such information could be priceless to oil companies weighing Libya’s still-considerable risks against the huge potential rewards.  Political support can help with access, and with the law. Sarkozy has hotly denied talk of “under the table deals for Libya’s riches”, including reports that in return for French help, oil group Total will be given preferential access to Libyan oil. Nonetheless, Paris has been frank about the payback it expects in return for spearheading NATO’s mission.  “The President took political and military risks, and all that creates an environment where the Libyan authorities and the people know what debt they owe France,” French Trade minister Pierre Lellouche told a September 6 symposium on the NTC arranged by the Franco-Libyan chamber of commerce. “We aren’t going to get embarrassed by helping our companies benefit from this advantage.”  In April, when Vitol shipped out rebel-produced oil, it had backing from the office of British Foreign Secretary William Hague, oil and diplomatic sources say.  A special group referred to by UK media as a secret oil cell, backed by British Prime Minister David Cameron, was staffed by a handful of officials and supported by Britain’s MI6 secret intelligence service, a diplomatic source said.  A European diplomatic source told Reuters members of the unit are also involved with smoothing the way for major oil companies to get back into Libya. The firms need advice on security, who to speak to and the life expectancy of the new administration, the person said.  A UK government spokesperson contacted for this report confirmed the oil cell’s existence.  “Oil was central to Gaddafi’s war machine,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Disrupting the supply and constricting his ability to raise revenue through sales hindered his ability to brutalize Libyan civilians. The Oil Cell also worked on how to support the resumption of the Libyan energy sector post-conflict and fed into broad planning, given the importance of this in providing a sustainable revenue source and meeting Libya’s own fuel needs.”  Asked about the government’s cooperation with Vitol, the spokesperson said: “The UK policy supported the supply of fuel to the NTC. The oil cell provided the same information on supply of fuel to a broad range of companies, but advised them to take their own independent legal advice on whether any activities would be contrary to any applicable laws.”  Other companies have since moved in, but Vitol alone is estimated to have supplied around 20-25 shipments, mainly of diesel over the past two months, according to a Reuters survey of industry sources, primarily sources in the shipping industry. The total bill for the fuels Vitol has delivered exceeds $1 billion, NTC sources say.  For Italian oil and gas group Eni, Libya’s biggest foreign oil operator, Silvio Berlusconi has been less of an asset. The Italian Prime Minister’s friendship with Gaddafi meant Rome switched allegiance to the rebels much later than other western capitals. Berlusconi said turning on his old friend made him feel “very bad”.  “April was a critical time and Eni wasn’t there from the beginning. Oil and politics are mixed,” said a source at Benghazi-based oil firm Agoco. “If we have two companies, Chinese or French, of course we choose the French. When the revolution started the Italians thought Gaddafi would win. They made a bad calculation.”  Eni has since made regular contact with the NTC, hoping its dominant position in Libyan oil production makes it indispensable, at least in the short term, says a person familiar with the company and its thinking. Italy’s foreign minister Franco Frattini says he recently met rebel leader Mahmoud Jibril, and expects him to visit Italy soon.  Eni’s chief executive joined top oil officials for a beachfront lunch in Benghazi in August and Nuri Berruien, the chairman of Libya’s National Oil Corporation, told Reuters the two firms had installed a “floating hotel” to provide accommodation for workers on an offshore gas field.  Russian firms face a similar bind. Moscow was highly critical of the west’s backing for the rebels and only recognized the NTC as Libya’s legitimate authority a few weeks ago. In August, Russia called a French arms drop a “crude violation” of the U.N. weapons embargo.  State arms exporter Rosoboronexport, previously a major supplier to Gaddafi, has estimated its losses as a result of the change of regime at $4 billion. The chairman of the Russia-Libya business council described the fall of Gaddafi as a disaster for Russian business interests, which extend into infrastructure projects and energy.  But by the end of August — before Moscow had recognized the NTC — Russian refined products had already been sent to Libya through Swiss-based trading house Gunvor, co-founded by Russian businessman Gennady Timchenko, according to market sources.  State-controlled gas export monopoly Gazprom, meanwhile, last week signed an option with Eni giving the Russian firm the right to acquire half of Eni’s 33 percent stake in the Elefant oilfield in Libya, Gazprom sources said. That option essentially keeps Gazprom’s oil arm in the game until the fighting ends.  China recognized the NTC last week. In March, it stopped short of using its U.N. Security Council veto power to block the NATO bombing campaign, but condemned the expansion of strikes and repeatedly urged both sides to compromise.  After Gaddafi fled Tripoli earlier this month, reporters found documents indicating that state-owned Chinese arms companies had offered to sell rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles and other arms worth a total of some $200 million to Gaddafi’s forces, despite the U.N. ban on such sales. (The documents also showed the United States and Britain had helped Gaddafi persecute dissidents.) Beijing said the companies had gone behind its back and the arms were never shipped.  Yet Chinese companies, like many U.S. firms, say they are waiting for the green light from their government to return to Libya, where the country’s construction industry had been heavily involved building railways, water plants and communication facilities. Before the conflict, China State Construction Engineering Corp and China Metallurgy Group were building 25,000 government-subsidized affordable apartments.  “The government pulled all of us back and now we would be looking out for the government’s leadership for moving us back,” said an official at a Chinese state firm with investments in Libya.  Another executive at a major Chinese energy firm is concerned that China’s policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries may increasingly conflict with the country’s economic interests. “If you have enough business interest to protect, you should take greater responsibility as a major economic power,” the executive told Reuters.  According to one European envoy, the NTC’s Minister of Transport and Communications is receiving daily calls and emails from the Chinese.  If Chinese companies are frustrated at missing out in Libya, at least they aren’t there to see the French move in. Casals of the Franco-Libyan Chamber of Commerce says about 20-30 French companies were involved in fact-finding missions to Benghazi in June and July. Earlier this month he said he would soon be traveling to the country “as a sort of boy scout”.  In the Gaddafi era, just under 50 French firms operated in Libya. In early September, when Paris hosted a symposium about the NTC for entrepreneurs, about 400 executives attended, rushing in and out with briefcases and notepads at the ready.  Attendees included an A-Z of the top names in the Paris CAC-40, law firms, architects, the postal service, wheat companies, printers, tobacco firms, and insurance firms. The meeting, organized by the Franco-Libyan chamber of commerce, was described by Courtaigne, the business lobbyist, as “focused and extremely studious”.  Jean-Jacques Royant, head of international cooperation at GEP, a lobby for French oil and gas services companies, said foreign trade minister Lellouche had told them that the big energy players should take the smaller ones under their wings to help them win contracts. Sarkozy may be pleased with his efforts, but no one is taking anything for granted.  “I don’t believe in favoritism,” Royant said. “There will be a reality on the ground. There are needs and then there will be companies that are better placed than others to service these needs. ... We have a lot of work ahead to rebuild our networks and address books.”  There are sure to be further shifts in Libya’s political landscape. “We are making it very clear that these are commercial deals — you do this, this and this and then goodbye. We are a transitional council and we cannot make decisions that last,” said one NTC source.  Little wonder companies are spreading their bets wide. “If someone’s head office has been shelled, if it’s someone you’ve been working for in the past, you might just want to get in there and do a bit of hard marketing and fix something for them in terms of the fabric of the building and get close to them again and get talking,” said the chief executive of one British building firm.  “It’s going to be close relationships and contacts in an environment like that that gets you work ... If you’ve got close relationships, you’re going to be months ahead.”  French telecoms firm Alcatel-Lucent and drugs company Sanofi are already working on the cellphone network and donating drugs;  France has promised cabins so students can begin school and the NTC has signed contracts with a French grain firm for wheat worth $22 million.  Whatever the politics, real connections will be decisive. Easy to rekindle and hard to erase, they clinch deals that high-level diplomacy can only help set up. The British business representatives who traveled by trawler to Misrata were “hugely well received,” said the engineering executive in London. “They were invited to go because of the relationships we’ve established in Libya.”  Antoine Sivan, France’s envoy to Benghazi, puts it this way: “France is going through a love story here. To the French entrepreneurs who come and meet me, I say: ‘They (the NTC) so far don’t have any money so do not expect to sign a contract right away, but put your foot in the door. Trust them.’”  Trust is priceless in any society. In Libya, it is lost at your peril. The country’s small population makes for a very close society, says a person in the Libyan oil industry.  “Six degrees of separation in Libya is more like 1.3,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “There’s a certain bedouin culture where it takes time to build up trust and, once you have it, you risk being burned if you mess it up.  “People are so interconnected that any Libyan on the street will be somehow connected to five members of the NTC.”  ",9232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-rebuild/special-report-how-to-win-business-in-libya-idUSTRE78M1RG20110923
21,OXY,"Libyan oil flows, foreign workers wait","BREGA, Libya, Sept 23 - Scribbled in blue marker in Arabic on the walls of Brega oil terminal of Brega is a message meant to cheer returning workers: “Gaddafi is gone and the place has been checked.”  Oil production has restarted in some Libyan fields including Sarir in the east, but the near-deserted Sirte Oil headquarters to the east of Muammar Gaddafi’s hometown is testament to the damage the conflict has done to the country’s main industry.  Amidst a cluster of crude oil storage tanks, gleaming white in the Mediterranean sunshine, stand at least two charred grey ones. The chimney of the site’s power plant lies in a gnarled wreck in the courtyard. A warehouse used for weapons storage, hit by a NATO bomb, is a tangle of wood and piping. A stash of missiles nestles in a petrochemical site, stored there by Gaddafi troops who took the gamble that NATO would not target expensive infrastructure.  Brega is one of a cluster of export terminals and Libyan oil companies are eager to get things started in a business worth about $176 million a day before the conflict. The country provides only around 2 percent of global oil consumption but its oil is prized for being easy to refine.  Some oil workers have marvelled that Gaddafi did not inflict damage to Libya’s oil facilities on the scale of Saddam Hussein, who ordered hundreds of oil wells to be set ablaze on his retreat from Kuwait in 1991. There has been no comprehensive survey of the Sirte Basin, which holds most of the country’s oil and gas fields, but interim oil minister Ali Tarhouni estimates the war has left 10-15 percent of Libya’s oil infrastructure damaged.  Yet safety remains a major concern, especially after militia killed 17 guards at the nearby Ras Lanuf refinery last week. Brega is probably out of range of even the most sophisticated rockets in Gaddafi’s arsenal. But the area is full of mines, and the country is strewn with ordnance dating back to World War Two. SPECIAL REPORT - How to win business in Libya  Fathi Issa, chairman of the management committee of state-owned Sirte Oil, waves a small, disk-shaped anti-personnel land mine the color of milky tea, and tells reporters that 6,000 of the explosives have been found on Brega beach.  “We will bring all the workers back when it’s safe. We find something new every day,” Issa told Reuters last week.  According to official figures from the National Transitional Council (NTC), 40,000 mines were planted around the Brega area during this year’s fighting; Military spokesman Ahmed Bani told Reuters an order for 120,000 from Brazil was placed by a Gaddafi officer during the conflict, suggesting the number could be much higher.  Rabea, an engineer at Sirte Oil who only gave his first name, commutes daily along the Brega-Ajdabiya coastal road which is flanked on both sides by war graves. He has tried three times to re-establish his daily routine since the war began, most recently in late August. “I’m not afraid. The mines are mostly on the seaside,” he said, his stoicism typical of many Libyans who have witnessed months of destruction.  Foreign oil companies are less nonchalant.  “I know many think we are cynical people ready to do anything to earn some bucks, but we are not going to put our staff in harm’s way. We need to make sure security is there,” said a French oil industry source.  Sirte Oil’s Issa says that besides mines, one problem has been sabotage to the Hateiba gasfields south of Brega. The tops of wells were found exposed, causing gas to leak out. Looting has forced many companies to order new equipment. Ras Lanuf Oil and Gas Company, or Rasco, told Reuters its tugboats were stolen by Gaddafi troops who used them to shuttle arms back and forth to Misrata when it was under siege.  Accommodation is hard to find. Some of the houses in the workers’ barracks are little more than sunken husks and there is no electricity or running water. An upturned armchair with loose stuffing is parked in the middle of the street. The forest-green uniform of a Gaddafi soldier lies on the pavement, apparently abandoned by its owner.  Still, spirits are high in the oil-rich east, one of the spearheads in the military campaign against Gaddafi. For people here, restarting oil output is a matter of pride.  In Benghazi, Yousef Mahmoud, an engineer at National Oil Company subsidiary Jowfe, has set up a society called the February 17 oil group, named to commemorate the day Libya’s revolt began. It has 4,000 members from Libyan oil firms. As well as restarting output, it wants to purge former Gaddafi sympathizers from the business and move the country’s umbrella oil firm NOC away from Tripoli and into the east.  “We are trying to push people to work again and we try to make a full report of the damage,” he told Reuters, sitting in the Benghazi office of U.S. oil services company Baker Hughes.  There was not an American to be seen in the office. Foreign oil firms have yet to return to Libya on a large scale. Economic sanctions have deterred many U.S. firms, even though the United Nations Security Council voted last week to ease them. Security is the main concern.  International oil firms are accustomed to working in hostile environments, but as a general rule they rely on their own security firms. This grates with Libyans, who feel they are capable of securing the country after ousting Gaddafi. That’s turning into a sticking point in negotiations.  “If security is good enough for Libyans it should be good enough for foreign workers,” said interim oil minister Ali Tarhouni. An oil official in the NTC told Reuters the country is planning to create a force of 5,000 security guards to secure oil and gas infrastructure.  Libya’s oil industry can restart without foreign firms, but analysts say a speedy return to pre-war output of 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) will depend on their return.  In the short term, the priority for oil production is to serve the Libyan people, says Abdalil Salah, an official in the oil ministry. Imports are costing Libya’s interim administration around $330 million a month. Blackouts and fuel shortages at service stations are still common.  Abdusalam el-Madani, head of administration for German oil company Wintershall in Libya, has visited his company’s oil sites which have not been mined or suffered major damage. “The facilities are ready to start operating and our foreign workers will be back by early October,” he said.  Official estimates of how quickly Libya’s oil output can recover range from a year to 15 months. That may seem slow, but Iraq’s oil output has yet to return to its late-1970s and early-1980s levels eight years after the fall of Saddam.  In messages broadcast from hiding, Gaddafi has threatened devastation similar to Saddam’s in Iraq. Until he is caught or killed, that remains a risk, particularly in remote desert areas like the Sirte Basin. In theory the area is under NTC control. But soldiers from Gaddafi’s desert strongholds could easily move eastwards.  Despite their concerns, Libya’s oil companies take solace in the preparations they made ahead of the crisis. Libya’s crude in the Sarir field is particularly waxy, and when in the late 1970s British oil major BP was forced out by nationalization, the company told the Libyans it would leave behind clogged pipelines.  “They said they would leave us with the world’s largest candlestick,” said Younis Feituri, a member of Agoco’s management committee for exploration and production. This time around, the company mixed the crude with a thinner variety of oil and it is now flowing to the Tobruk export terminal. “We haven’t forgotten BP’s words.”  ",9232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-oil/libyan-oil-flows-foreign-workers-wait-idUSTRE78M1QM20110923
22,OXY,SPECIAL REPORT-How to win business in Libya," For a PDF: link.reuters.com/det83s  By Emma Farge, Lorraine Turner and John Irish	   BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) Sept 23 - In August, as rebels fought forces loyal  to President Muammar Gaddafi, two representatives of a British business consortium took a “rather long and arduous ferry journey from Malta” to the North African country.	   “To describe it as a ferry would be very polite,” according to an executive at a London-based global engineering company, whose interests the two men represented. “I think it was a trawler.”	   The men travelled to Libya at the invitation of the rebel administration. Britain, along with France and the United States, had given political and military support for the uprising against Gaddafi and sponsored the rebel leadership, the National Transitional Council (NTC). This was a chance to close some deals.	   “We had people on the ground in Misrata,” said the businessman, who spoke by phone on condition of anonymity. “You could still hear ordnance from the centre of Misrata, so it was very much an ongoing situation. But they were already talking about training and equipping fire brigades, training and equipping police.”	   The visitors keep coming. In the lobby of the Tibesti Hotel in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, opportunists mix with diplomats, journalists and aid workers. With NATO’s help, the rebels have deposed Gaddafi and now control Tripoli, the capital. Elsewhere fierce fighting continues and Gaddafi remains holed up. The country has yet to pay its workers, write a new constitution or even name a transitional government. But it is a land with deep pockets, and plenty of new friends.	   French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron received a heroes’ welcome last week when they became the first western leaders to visit since Gaddafi’s ouster. Interim leader Abdel Jalil said the rebels’ allies could expect preferential treatment in return for their help.	   It was a clear signal that countries which had not backed the NATO bombing campaign, including Russia, China and Germany, or which were slow to denounce Gaddafi, like Italy, stand to lose out.	   But if French and British politicians are tallying up the contracts, business executives are leaving little to chance. Foreign companies withdrew from Libya at the outset of the NATO bombing campaign; sanctions imposed on Gaddafi’s regime since February have added to the difficulty of doing business. 	   Despite this, dozens of executives from France, Britain, Italy and other countries have spent months building ties with potential Libyan partners. In a country fractured by tribe and politics, they say it is relationships that will prove decisive.	   The potential profits are huge. While there are pockets of damage to infrastructure and former Gaddafi command centres, the country is in far better shape than Iraq was after the fall of Saddam. At the same time, Libya needs new investment in everything from schools to services. According to the French business federation, Libya should offer around $200 billion in investment opportunities over the next 10 years. With a population of just over 6 million and Africa’s largest oil reserves, it has plenty to spend. Up to $170 billion worth of frozen Gaddafi-era assets alone should help pay for reconstruction.	   Here’s how companies are playing this new front in the latest scramble for Africa.	  	   Western firms, including trading houses Vitol, Trafigura and Gunvor have already been busy. A London-based team for Vitol sold oil products to the rebels in large volumes as early as April, and helped ship their first crude oil cargo. Trafigura expressed interest, although it is not clear if any deals were concluded. 	   France landed executives in Benghazi in June and July, according to Michel Casals, head of the Franco-Libyan Chamber of Commerce. 	   “There’s no point going when people are not ready, but we can’t go in six months when everybody has already been there,” says Thierry Courtaigne, director general of French business lobby Medef International, which represents the interests of France’s top companies overseas.

A study had shown the three locations could become a source of oil, the agency said, after drilling by Western companies over the last two decades since Albania ended communism failed to find commercial quantities.	   Malfor Nuri, general manager for Albania, said Petromanas would drill near Shkoder, at Elbasan in central Albania and farther down south near Berat, where Occidental Petroleum  has drilled in the past. 	   Petromanas says it is focused on exploring and developing assets in Albania that “possess world-class resource potential” and its acreage lies “within a proven hydrocarbon system”.

24,OXY,How to Play It: Investors drill down on oil,"THE ISSUE: Oil prices will weaken only slightly and hover above benchmark Brent $100 a barrel next year, despite fears of a global economic recession and a steep fall in demand, according to a Reuters poll.  By Manuela Badawy and Sam Forgione  (Reuters) - As the U.S. dollar appreciates against major trading currencies and global economic growth decelerates, crude oil prices are likely to remain under pressure.  Investors and analysts say the oil market has not yet priced in a weaker economic environment and the potential for oil prices to fall. Yet there are some defensive plays and stocks to consider. Here are some ideas from investing experts:  In times when oil prices are going down, investors tend to bet on companies such as Exxon Mobil — a defensive name in the energy sector — as they would be less volatile than many other E&P and services companies, said Mike Fox, research analyst at investment firm Farr, Miller & Washington, with $675 million in assets under management.  Ted Harper, fund manager and senior research analyst at Frost Investment Advisors, LLC with $7.7 billion in assets under management agrees.  Within the context of U.S. benchmark WTI oil averaging $90 a barrel, there is likely more risk to the upside, and thus Chevron, Total S.A, Hess and Occidental Petroleum Corp. are defensive plays.  “There are smaller opportunities but with bigger prospects as new wells are being drilled in West Africa, that if they hit, these companies will see improvement,” Harper said, mentioning Cobalt International Energy as an example.  Meanwhile, John White, analyst for Triple Double Advisors said his portfolio is heavily weighted toward oil E&P companies. He said he likes Berry Petroleum, Concho Resources, and small caps GeoResources and Nimin Energy Corp.  “We like those companies because we like the areas that they have leases in, we know the management teams and the companies have been executing their development plans very well,” White added.  Fox favors service companies such as Schlumberger Ltd and Weatherford over Halliburton Co. “based on the fact that the international cycle hasn’t kicked in yet.”  Energy analysts expect economic growth to continue slowing down and oil fundamentals to weaken.  Michael Wittner, head of commodity research for the Americas at Societe Generale, forecast for the next six months that Brent will average $98 a barrel and WTI will average $73 a barrel, compared to current trends at $105.34 for Brent and $83.53 for WTI.  “If I am an investor and, for some reason, I feel I must be in oil in the next couple of quarters, I would do it from the short side, not the long side,” said Wittner.  Stephen Schork, president of the Schork Group, said the market not approaching levels of WTI below $80 a barrel “does seem to attract buying interest. If you are looking to make the oil play, you are playing in an area of support.”  Schork also believes in integrated oil companies which do not have exposure to refinery.  “It is very difficult to be a Valero or Conoco in this market, this is why Conoco is divesting,” he said. “You are looking to get in more toward the exploration and on the oil side, you want to maximize that and minimize your exposure to the downstream.”  Diversifying your portfolio through ETFs and mutual funds with exposure to oil stocks is more protective than a pure stock play and finds favor with two strategists.  Chris Phillips, senior analyst at Vanguard, reminded investors, “funds that they hold already have exposure to some oil stocks,” which narrows the decision to whether or not the investor should overweight those exposures. Phillips avers that energy stocks are already priced into the market, and investors would be “betting against the market by overweighting.”  “The cons outweigh the pros for overweighting, and they concern the difficulty of predicting market moves and commodity price moves,” Phillips said in reference to U.S. crude’s spike to nearly $150 in July 2008, and recent fall to $80.  Phillips advises investors to diversify their oil exposure through “a broad ETF or mutual fund that would incorporate all the energy stocks,” and offered the Vanguard Energy ETF as a buy.  Rob Wherry, a mutual fund analyst at Morningstar, recommended BlackRock Energy and Resources for its small and mid-cap ratios and Invesco Energy and Vanguard for their large-caps.

25,OXY,How to Play It: Investors drill down on oil," THE ISSUE: Oil prices will weaken only slightly and hover above benchmark Brent $100 a barrel next year, despite fears of a global economic recession and a steep fall in demand, according to a Reuters poll. [O/POLL]   By Manuela Badawy and Sam Forgione   Sept 29 (Reuters) - As the U.S. dollar appreciates against major trading currencies and global economic growth decelerates, crude oil prices are likely to remain under pressure.   Investors and analysts say the oil market has not yet priced in a weaker economic environment and the potential for oil prices to fall. Yet there are some defensive plays and stocks to consider. Here are some ideas from investing experts:   In times when oil prices are going down, investors tend to bet on companies such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) — a defensive name in the energy sector — as they would be less volatile than many other E&P and services companies, said Mike Fox, research analyst at investment firm Farr, Miller & Washington, with $675 million in assets under management.   Ted Harper, fund manager and senior research analyst at Frost Investment Advisors, LLC with $7.7 billion in assets under management agrees.   Within the context of U.S. benchmark WTI oil averaging $90 a barrel, there is likely more risk to the upside, and thus Chevron (CVX.N), Total S.A (TOTF.PA) (TOT.N), Hess (HES.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY.N) are defensive plays.   “There are smaller opportunities but with bigger prospects as new wells are being drilled in West Africa, that if they hit, these companies will see improvement,” Harper said, mentioning Cobalt International Energy CIE.N as an example.   Meanwhile, John White, analyst for Triple Double Advisors said his portfolio is heavily weighted toward oil E&P companies. He said he likes Berry Petroleum BRY.N, Concho Resources (CXO.N), and small caps GeoResources GEOI.O and Nimin Energy Corp NNN.TO.   “We like those companies because we like the areas that they have leases in, we know the management teams and the companies have been executing their development plans very well,” White added.   Fox favors service companies such as Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Weatherford (WFT.N) over Halliburton Co. (HAL.N) “based on the fact that the international cycle hasn’t kicked in yet.”   Energy analysts expect economic growth to continue slowing down and oil fundamentals to weaken.   Michael Wittner, head of commodity research for the Americas at Societe Generale, forecast for the next six months that Brent will average $98 a barrel and WTI will average $73 a barrel, compared to current trends at $105.34 for Brent and $83.53 for WTI.   “If I am an investor and, for some reason, I feel I must be in oil in the next couple of quarters, I would do it from the short side, not the long side,” said Wittner.   Stephen Schork, president of the Schork Group, said the market not approaching levels of WTI below $80 a barrel “does seem to attract buying interest. If you are looking to make the oil play, you are playing in an area of support.”   Schork also believes in integrated oil companies which do not have exposure to refinery.   “It is very difficult to be a Valero (VLO.N) or Conoco (COP.N) in this market, this is why Conoco is divesting,” he said. “You are looking to get in more towards the exploration and on the oil side, you want to maximize that and minimize your exposure to the downstream.”   Diversifying your portfolio through ETFs and mutual funds with exposure to oil stocks is more protective than a pure stock play and finds favor with two strategists.   Chris Phillips, senior analyst at Vanguard, reminded investors, “funds that they hold already have exposure to some oil stocks,” which narrows the decision to whether or not the investor should overweight those exposures. Phillips avers that energy stocks are already priced into the market, and investors would be “betting against the market by overweighting.”   “The cons outweigh the pros for overweighting, and they concern the difficulty of predicting market moves and commodity price moves,” Phillips said in reference to U.S. crude’s spike to nearly $150 in July 2008, and recent fall to $80.   Phillips advises investors to diversify their oil exposure through “a broad ETF or mutual fund that would incorporate all the energy stocks,” and offered the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) as a buy.   Rob Wherry, a mutual fund analyst at Morningstar, recommended BlackRock Energy and Resources (BGR.N) for its small and mid-cap ratios and Invesco Energy (IENYX.O) and Vanguard for their large-caps.   Michael Jones, chief investment officer of Riverfront Investment Group, said investors need to be careful and understand the contango issues in oil.   “If the forward price is $10 higher than spot, then, in an unchanged market, you’ll lose $10 in three months,” he said.

26,OXY,"Conoco buys Libyan oil, 1st of U.S. majors -sources"," * To deliver to German Miro refinery - source   * Other U.S. majors also close to resuming buying   * Purchase to help further normalise Libya oil trade    By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Emma Farge	   LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips became the first U.S. major to buy Libyan oil following the end of international sanctions in a move to help the country restore normal oil trade after seven months of civil war.	   Trading sources told Reuters that tanker Hellas Warrior, which loaded 381,000 barrels of Sarir and Mesla crude, was bought by Conoco for delivery to France’s Mediterranean port of Fos/Lavera, and one source said it was destined for Germany’s MIRO refinery.	   Libya’s Arabian Gulf Oil Company (Agoco) gave the cargo to Vitol in payment for oil product deliveries, and Vitol then sold it to Conoco, the sources said.	   U.S. companies were among the most active buyers of light and low-sulphur Libyan crude before the civil war and were the first to stop purchases after Washington and the European Union slapped sanctions on the government of now-ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi.	   Sanctions against Libya have been removed or eased about a month ago, but sources at U.S. firms have said it will take a few weeks before they can resume purchases of Libyan crude.	   “We have done most of the work and are close to sorting out our internal problems to be able to buy again,” said a source at a major U.S. firm other than Conoco.	   A source at Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) confirmed that the transaction had taken place and said it expected to start dealing with U.S. oil firms directly in the near future.	   “That deal was done through Agoco. We have some contacts with the United States and they tell us they can start buying again,” he said.	   Agoco, a subsidiary of NOC, has been handling marketing operations in recent months because of international sanctions on the umbrella firm.	   The NOC source said that it would start marketing crude again by mid-October.   	   Oil is slowly starting to flow again from Libya after seven months of fighting and, if fresh projections prove correct, may beat the expectations of analysts, who think it could take three years to reach pre-war output levels.   	   Libyan oil industry is dominated by European players, although U.S. companies such as Conoco, Marathon , Hess  and Occidental are also involved in a number of exploration and production projects in the country, the holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves.

30,OXY,"BP, CNPC get 3rd Iraq Rumaila crude payments-source","* Iraq okays 2nd payment for Occidental, Kogas for Zubair BAGHDAD, Dec 13 (Reuters) - BP Plc received a third payment for its investment in Iraq’s supergiant Rumaila oilfield when a tanker loaded 2 million barrels of light crude at the southern oil hub of Basra on Tuesday, a shipping source said. The vessel B Elephant started loading on Saturday and finished on Tuesday, the shipping source at the port said. BP’s partner at Rumaila, China’s CNPC, also received a third payment when the vessel Tenki left Basra port on Dec. 8 carrying two million barrels of Basra light crude, the shipper said. BP received two payments for the millions of dollars it has invested in Rumaila in May and July. CNPC started to get paid in May. Rumaila, the workhorse of Iraq’s oil industry, has some 17 billion barrels in estimated crude reserves and usually pumps around 1.2-1.3 million bpd, which is almost half of Iraq’s output. BP and CNPC are owed more than $1 billion for work at Rumaila over the past year or so, where production has been increasing. BP and CNPC have been developing the Rumaila field as part of Iraq’s ambitious plans to expand its oil industry to extract the billions of dollars it needs to rebuild tattered infrastructure after years of war and sanctions. A source at Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organisation (SOMO) confirmed the payments for Rumaila and said SOMO has also allocated one million barrels of Basra light crude to Occidental Petroleum Corp and South Korea’s KOGAS, divided as 500,000 barrels each, as a second payment for developing Zubair oilfield. Both Rumaila and Zubair oilfields are among a series of oilfields Iraq auctioned off to international oil firms in 2009 under service agreements, which stipulate that the firms start to be paid and to recover costs once they boost production by 10 percent above an agreed baseline production.",12132011,http://www.reuters.com/article/iraq-oil-payments/bp-cnpc-get-3rd-iraq-rumaila-crude-payments-source-idUSL6E7ND2DO20111213

35,OXY,Libya extends Zueitina oil concession for 25 years,"TRIPOLI, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Libya has extended Zueitina Oil Company’s concession to operate its oilfields for another 25 years, a document signed by Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib showed. The company, a subsidiary of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC), was established in 1986 to operate Libyan oil assets that Occidental Petroleum had to abandon following U.S. sanctions against late leader Muammar Gaddafi’s regime. Deputy Oil Minister Omar Shakmak told Reuters on Friday the length of the original Zueitina contract was for 25 years, consistent with a Libyan law that set the timeframe. The concessions were set to expire in 2011, during which an eight-month conflict toppled Gaddafi. The document dated Feb 5 and posted on Zuetina’s website formalises a government letter of intent dated Jan 1 to extend the contract. Occidental and Austria’s OMV have stakes in joint ventures with Libya’s NOC that fall under Zueitina’s umbrella. Zueitina restarted production in October at a rate of about 30,000 barrels per day, about half of its pre-war output.

First-quarter production of 755,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (bpd) included domestic production of 455,000 bpd.

And it will continue to grow at a pretty decent pace.” Chazen also said international output should return to normal after Colombian insurgent attacks caused output there to fall by 7,000 bpd in the first quarter, and he expected Libya to return to its historical norm of about 14,000 bpd by year-end. First-quarter net profit rose to $1.6 billion, or $1.92 per share, from $1.5 billion, or $1.90 per share, a year earlier.

46,OXY,"Insight: Peak, pause or plummet? Shale oil costs at crossroads","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum was among the first major U.S. oil drillers to make a big bet on the resurgence of domestic production, spending billions to grab oil patches from Texas to North Dakota. Now, as it bemoans steep costs and moves its rigs out of the Bakken shale oil fields, some analysts wonder if the company has lost its clairvoyance. After two years of unyielding gains, costs are bound to fall, they say. The California-based energy giant is beset by escalating labor costs in North Dakota, which has the lowest unemployment rate in the country. Other material costs have surged and new environmental regulations could add to the burden. The cost of bringing one Bakken well into production has grown from an average $6.5 million in 2010 to $8.5 million in the first quarter this year, data from company reports and the state regulator show. “We got a lot better places to put money right now than the Bakken,” Occidental CEO Stephen Chazen said on a conference call with analysts late last month. “That’s why I’m slowing it down.” But if some analysts are right, Occidental’s pullout may prove ill-timed. The costs to complete a well by injecting it with water, sand and other chemicals — the hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” process — is falling as natural gas firms pare back on new drilling. Pressure pumping prices, which cover a range of costs associated with fracking a well, have already dipped by up to 25 percent in natural gas-rich basins, with signs of a knock-on effect emerging in the Bakken, according to Barclays analysts. Within the next six months, these costs could fall by as much as 10 percent in the Bakken shale, analysts at Bernstein Research estimate. Efficient forms of fracking are also helping companies extract more oil from each well, lowering the break-even cost of production, now estimated between $55 and $70 a barrel. The push and pull of production costs in the world’s fastest-growing oil frontier is adding uncertainty to the outlook for U.S. oil prices. The issue is already in the limelight this election year, with both political parties touting shale oil as a step toward energy independence, even as environmentalists fret over the controversial fracking process, which has been blamed for the pollution of water supplies and minor earthquakes. If costs start to slip, the explosive output growth could keep a lid on U.S. oil prices, regardless of tensions with Iran that have threatened global supply. If they continue to rise, breakneck output growth may stall as more companies follow Occidental’s lead and begin to pare back drilling and investment. The two biggest plays — the Williston basin in North Dakota and Eagle Ford in Texas — produced an estimated 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, close to the output from OPEC member Algeria, according to data from analytics company Bentek Energy. A year ago, they were producing only a third as much. Over the past three years, drilling in U.S. shale patches has become an expensive affair, even as producers got better acquainted with the shale rock they mined. Service firms could name their price while the producers scrambled to drill. Sand and ceramics, which companies pump into deep wells in a water and chemical mix to frack a well, were in scant supply. The spot price of guar — a gum processed from tiny seeds and used to thicken fracking water — has ballooned by 10-fold since January 2011 and doubled since the start of this year, according to data from Agra Informa, an agricultural consultancy. The nationwide cost of drilling and other well services for oil and gas wells has risen 22.5 percent since October 2009, hitting a five-year high in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Producer Price Index (PPI). Meanwhile, prices for shale oil, particularly from the Bakken, fell as the glut of new crude supplies in the Midwest led to deep discounts for U.S. benchmark crude. Bakken crude for June delivery at the Clearbrook, Minnesota hub was bid as low as $85.24 a barrel on Wednesday and offered at $93.69, down 6.5 percent from October levels, according to traders. For now, prices are comfortably above the $68 a barrel breakeven point for a 15 percent rate of return, according to Credit Suisse analysis. But this year’s slump in natural gas prices to a 10-year low is beginning to change the game. Pricing power is shifting from service companies to drillers, possibly capping costs, as energy firms slash gas-directed drilling rigs by 23 percent. Houston-based oil services firm Baker Hughes projects the number of rigs drilling for both oil and gas at the end of 2012 will be just under 2,000, only one percent higher than last year. At the same time, total U.S. pressure-pumping capacity is expected to grow to 19 million horsepower this year, two-and-a-half times the levels three years ago, according to research firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Some of this new capacity is operated by small fracking firms that are mushrooming across North America who are willing to take on projects for a fraction of what the big firms charge. What is more, fracking crews, previously engaged in dry-gas outposts, are already moving out of east Texas and Louisiana and into the hyperactive Eagle Ford shale in south Texas or the Bakken up north. Bad news for oil-services firms also highlights the trend. Halliburton, the market leader in pressure pumping, lost 5 percent of its operating income in North America in the first quarter of 2012, compared with the previous quarter, as the price it charged for pressure pumping slumped. The company said its North American margins will fall into the low 20 percent range by the end of 2012, down from about 25 percent at present. Efficiency is also improving. Whiting Petroleum, one of the largest producers in the Bakken, says it has cut the days it spends drilling wells to 15, which shaves off about $1.5 million in costs. The company also uses a fracking method called sliding sleeves that adds another $1.5 million in savings, according to CEO Jim Volker. He says Whiting’s average well costs vary from $6 million in the sweet spots of the Sanish field in central Bakken to $7 million elsewhere in North Dakota. Other input costs may also be poised to decline. EOG Resources says it is spending $500,000 less on each Eagle Ford well after it started using sand from its own mines in north-central Texas and Wisconsin. The company says its well costs in the south Texas play average $5.5 million per well, giving it a $1.5 million edge over other operators there. EOG’s Wisconsin mine, which started operating in January, is one of the 20 new sand mines that popped up in the state since last year. Neighboring Minnesota has 13 pending applications for new mines but most of these were stopped short by county-level moratoriums that will be in effect well into next winter, according to Tony Runckel, the state’s chief geologist. While sand or “proppant” prices haven’t fallen yet, input prices are likely to decline later this year, according to Barclays analysts James West. US Silica, one of the largest frack sand producers in the United States, is tying up more long-term contracts, a sign that it is also anticipating a possible downturn in prices. Guar supply is another issue. Indian farmers, who cater to 80 percent of worldwide guar demand, are sowing record volumes of the seed this season but it is not entirely clear if this autumn’s harvest will meet growing U.S. demand. Even though cost declines are on the horizon, they may be slow to arrive. New state regulations in North Dakota, put in effect at the start of April, could add up to $400,000 to the cost of each well, since they proscribe the use of reserve pits to store discarded drilling fluids, according to the state Petroleum Council, which represents producers. The long-term contracts that many developers have with the oil services firms will also stand in the way. Those contracts, which ensured steady prices when costs were on the up, are a long way from their end and, in most cases, are unlikely to be renegotiated soon. Houston-based driller Marathon Oil said its first-quarter well costs in the Eagle Ford were unchanged at $8.5 million a well because of such contracts, which the company’s Chief Operating Officer, David Roberts, said are keeping his firm from “as much price relief, potentially, as we would like.” Halliburton, in fact, says it is going back to producers, with steeper price schedules in tow, so it can pass on some of the lofty raw material costs, its CEO David Lesar said in April. “I suspect the pressure will come when they start to roll over” the contracts, Lesar told analysts last month. In the Bakken shale, that could be as far out as eighteen months into the future, according to James Crandell, global head of oilfield services research at Dahlman Rose in New York. Even then, Crandell says, contracts will be renewed at “modestly lower” prices in North Dakota. “In other regions, particularly natural gas (fields), I expect larger reductions when the contracts end,” he added. Still, even Occidental does not intend to fully move out of oil-rich shale plays like the Bakken. “This is the Willie Sutton discussion,” CEO Chazen said, comparing his strategy with that of the slick bank robber from Brooklyn. “Why are we there? Because that’s where the oil is.” (This version of the story has been corrected to fix the name of Occidental’s CEO) ",5172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shale-costs/insight-peak-pause-or-plummet-shale-oil-costs-at-crossroads-idUSBRE84G06620120517

48,OXY,"CORRECTED-INSIGHT: Peak, pause or plummet? Shale oil costs at crossroads","By Selam Gebrekidan NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum  was among the first major U.S. oil drillers to make a big bet on the resurgence of domestic production, spending billions to grab oil patches from Texas to North Dakota. Now, as it bemoans steep costs and moves its rigs out of the Bakken shale oil fields, some analysts wonder if the company has lost its clairvoyance. After two years of unyielding gains, costs are bound to fall, they say. The California-based energy giant is beset by escalating labor costs in North Dakota, which has the lowest unemployment rate in the country. Other material costs have surged and new environmental regulations could add to the burden. The cost of bringing one Bakken well into production has grown from an average $6.5 million in 2010 to $8.5 million in the first quarter this year, data from company reports and the state regulator show. “We got a lot better places to put money right now than the Bakken,” Occidental CEO Stephen Chazen said on a conference call with analysts late last month. “That’s why I’m slowing it down.” But if some analysts are right, Occidental’s pullout may prove ill-timed. The costs to complete a well by injecting it with water, sand and other chemicals — the hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” process — is falling as natural gas firms pare back on new drilling. Pressure pumping prices, which cover a range of costs associated with fracking a well, have already dipped by up to 25 percent in natural gas-rich basins, with signs of a knock-on effect emerging in the Bakken, according to Barclays analysts.

49,OXY,UPDATE 1-Occidental must defend environmental lawsuit in US,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 31 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court denied Occidental Petroleum Corp’s request to revisit a prior ruling that an environmental lawsuit against the company must be litigated in the United States. The order on Thursday came from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The proposed class action against the fourth-largest U.S. oil company was filed on behalf of members of indigenous Achuar communities. They accuse Occidental of discharging millions of gallons of toxic oil byproducts into waterways in the northern Peruvian rainforest. A Los Angeles federal judge had ruled that the case should be litigated in Peru, but in 2010, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel reversed that decision. Occidental then asked the full 9th Circuit to revisit the determination to keep the case in the United States. A majority of the court’s active judges voted to let the ruling stand, but five 9th Circuit judges publicly disagreed on Thursday, saying the ruling should be revisited. That may increase the chances that the U.S. Supreme Court could review the case. An Occidental representative was not immediately available for comment.

58,OXY,Occidental quarterly profit lower,"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) reported a 28 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday on lower oil prices, but earnings were better than expected and the company increased spending and planned more U.S. production growth. The fourth-largest U.S. oil company said second-quarter output grew to 766,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent from 715,000 a year earlier. This included an average of 462,000 bpd of U.S. production, a rate it saw reaching 480,000 bpd by the end of this year. Outside its home market, volumes would be about the same this quarter as in the second quarter, the company said, and production in Libya had now just about reached pre-war levels. Occidental said its worldwide effective tax rate would rise to 42 percent in the third quarter from 40 percent in the second. Permitting in California had improved, Chief Executive Stephen Chazen said, and now he was holding back on investing in more drilling because the cost per well remained too high and he wanted to see it come down first. “Giving them more money does not cause that,” Chazen said on a conference call. “And so a little diet for a little while will have significant reductions in their cost per well. I’m talking not 10 percent, not 20 percent, but a third.” Net profit fell to $1.3 billion, or $1.64 per share, from $1.8 billion, or $2.23 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected $1.60 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Occidental shares were 2 percent higher at $85.14 in afternoon trading. The company said its 2012 capital expenditure was now targeted at $9.2 billion, up from $8.3 billion, with two-thirds of the increase going to Al Hosn Shah in Abu Dhabi - a $10 billion gas project in which Oxy has a 40 percent stake. On Wednesday, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Hess Corp (HES.N) also reported lower quarterly profits, and raised their spending plans in a bid to increase crude oil production. Brent crude prices averaged about $109 per barrel in the second quarter, down $8 from the same quarter a year ago. Chazen said investors should not expect large-scale dealmaking for the Los Angeles-based company after it spent $1 billion on deals scattered around South Texas, the Permian basin centered in West Texas, and North Dakota’s Williston basin. The Williston remained a clear “number three” priority domestically for Occidental after the Permian and California, said Chazen, who is cutting its number of rigs there in half. “It is really a cost issue. I think that the service companies are getting rich as pigs there,” Chazen said. “We are still continuing to put capital there, but not at the level we were ... it is clearly assets for the future rather than a big driver for today.” ",7262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-occidentalpetroleum-earnings/occidental-quarterly-profit-lower-idUSBRE86P1A420120726

60,OXY,Occidental quarterly profit lower,"July 26 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp  reported a 28 percent decline in quarterly profit Thursday on lower oil prices. The fourth-largest U.S. oil company said production in the quarter climbed to 766,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent from 715,000 a year earlier. Net profit fell to $1.3 billion, or $1.64 per share, from $1.8 billion, or $2.23 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected $1.60 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On Wednesday, ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp  also reported lower quarterly profits, but raised their spending plans for the year in a bid to increase crude oil production. Brent crude oil prices averaged about $109 per barrel in the second quarter, down $8 from the same quarter a year earlier.",7262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/occidentalpetroleum-earnings/occidental-quarterly-profit-lower-idUSL2E8IPKEJ20120726

62,OXY,Eni has no plans for Kurdistan oil deals - CEO,"RIMINI, Italy, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Italian oil and gas group Eni does not plan to compromise its business in Iraq by making energy deals with the country’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said on Monday. State-controlled Eni, together with U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Corp and South Korea’s KOGAS, has a 20-year deal with Iraq to develop the Zubair oilfield, which is expected to produce 400,000 barrels per day in 2013. Speaking on the sidelines of a conference, Scaroni said that one of the conditions for developing the Zubair field was that there could be no deals with local governments such as that of Kurdistan. “We will not be throwing into doubt those agreements,” Scaroni said. Canada’s ShaMaran Petroleum Corp said on Monday that a unit of French oil major Total had bought a minority share in an exploration block in the Kurdistan region, having made a similar deal last month. Iraq’s central government says the deals are illegal. Total followed U.S. oil majors Exxon and Chevron  in ignoring Baghdad’s warnings about possible punitive action and signing contracts with the region, in northern Iraq.

The Ecuadorean government decided to terminate Occidental Petroleum’s contract in May 2006, arguing that the company had sold a stake in its operations without government consent. “Claimants are awarded the amount of $1.769 billion,” said the award ruling posted on the website of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID. It also ordered Ecuador to pay “pre-award interest on the above amount at the rate of 4.188 percent per annum, compounded annually from 16 May 2006 until the date of this award.” Occidental Petroleum, also known as Oxy, filed a request for arbitration in July 2006. The ruling said that Ecuador’s seizure of an oil block operated by Occidental was “tantamount to expropriation”. Ecuador’s leftist President Rafael Correa said that the Andean country would appeal the decision. “We’ll ask for it to be declared null and void. We’re used to confronting these abuses, these obstacles, and we’ll continue defending the integrity of the country,” Correa told reporters. Ecuador’s attorney general Diego Garcia said earlier this week that Occidental was seeking nearly $3.4 billion in damages from the OPEC-member country. He said Ecuador was only willing to pay up to $417 million to Occidental. Ecuador is OPEC’s smallest member and produces around 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day.

The World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) on Friday ordered Ecuador to pay the hefty sum to Occidental, the fourth largest U.S. oil company, as a compensation for taking over its assets in 2006. Shortly after the ruling was announced, leftist President Rafael Correa said Ecuador would lodge an appeal. “This new process could take between one and two years, if one looks at previous cases seeking annulment, and taking into account how complex this case is,” Attorney General Diego Garcia told reporters. It took more than six years for the ICSID to issue the original ruling since Occidental Petroleum, also known as Oxy, filed a request for arbitration in July 2006. The ICSID also ordered Ecuador to pay pre-award interest on the amount at the rate of 4.188 percent per annum, compounded annually from May 2006 until the date of the award. ICSID data shows that Oxy’s award was the largest ever arbitration ruling against Ecuador by the center. Garcia said that once the country files for appeal it will not be obliged to pay the award until the ICSID issues a new ruling, but that interest payments would continue to apply. He said ICSID regulations allow Ecuador to file for appeal within 120 days of the original ruling.

The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) on Friday ordered Ecuador to pay the hefty sum to Occidental, the fourth largest U.S. oil company, as a compensation for taking over its assets in 2006. “The annulment request has already been filed before the ICSID,” a spokesman for the attorney general’s office told Reuters. He said that Ecuador argued that the ICSID did not have jurisdiction in the case because the contract between Occidental and the Ecuadorean state did not name the body as the arena to solve differences.

It took more than six years for the ICSID to issue the original ruling since Occidental Petroleum, also known as Oxy, filed a request for arbitration in July 2006.

69,OXY,"Occidental, Conoco profits fall on lower prices","(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates as they produced more oil and gas than expected, even as lower prices hurt profits. Shares of Conoco and Occidental rose about 2 percent on afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading on Thursday. During the third quarter the companies increased drilling in North America, where large oil companies are spending more in a bid to increase production. Conoco had record output in the Eagle Ford basin in south Texas, while Occidental saw strong production of higher-priced crude oil in the Permian Basin. “(Conoco’s) ramp-up in the Eagle Ford is on track or exceeding the market’s expectations,” said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer. “They delivered on everything they said they would, and more.” North American shale fields are increasingly seen as a relatively low-cost, reliable source of both oil and natural gas in an era when nations like Russia and Brazil are tightening control of their resources. Natural gas prices in the United States fell 30 percent in the third quarter, compared with a year earlier, to $2.83 per million British thermal units, burdened by heavy supplies. The average Brent oil price of $110 per barrel in the quarter was down $2, hit by worries about slowing demand. Conoco’s third-quarter profit fell 31 percent and Occidental’s declined 22 percent, hurt by the lower oil and natural gas prices. Conoco’s oil and gas output in the quarter was 1.53 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE), down from 1.54 million a year earlier. For the fourth quarter, Conoco sees production gains from the previous quarter, with higher output coming from the Eagle Ford and the company’s oil sands properties in Canada. It expects to spend $15.5 billion to $16 billion this year, reaching the upper end of that range if it buys acreage in shale basins. Conoco’s budget for 2013 will be of a similar size, Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance told analysts on a conference call. This was Conoco’s first quarter to report earnings as an standalone exploration and production company. Earlier this year, it split off its refining business. Now, Conoco is selling assets and increasing dividends as part of an effort to return cash to shareholders. Excluding items related to asset sales and taxes, Conoco, the No. 3 U.S. oil company, had a profit of $1.44 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $1.19. Occidental, the No. 4 U.S. oil company, said net profit fell to $1.38 billion, or $1.69 per share, from $1.77 billion, or $2.17 per share, a year earlier. Analysts looked for $1.63 per share, according to the average on Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “(Occidental’s) earnings were strong across the board, driven by higher-than-expected U.S. oil production, lower unit costs and strong chemicals segment income,” Sterne Agee analyst Tim Rezvan said. Output rose 4 percent from a year ago to 766,000 barrels per day. Still, Occidental’s CEO Stephen Chazen expressed concern about the company’s returns when speaking on a conference call with analysts. “If I don’t see real improvements in the returns, you know, in the next couple of quarters, strategy will change,” said Chazen, adding that could take the form of higher dividends or even farming out wells to other companies.

74,OXY,Occidental Petroleum says faced cyber attack on email in 2009-10,"Nov 2 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp, the fourth-largest U.S. oil company said on Friday it faced an attack on its email system a few years ago, at a time when the energy industry emerged as a prime hacking target. The disclosure follows a year after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a lengthy document detailing when publicly traded companies should report hacking incidents. “In 2009 and 2010 Occidental experienced a cyber attack on its email system, which had no effect on its operations, financial systems or reputation,” the company said in its quarterly filing with the SEC, released on Friday. Occidental acknowledged in the new “risk factor” that cyber attacks on businesses had escalated in recent years and it relies on electronic networks to run its operations, which have “multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack.” An Occidental spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. A report by leading security firm McAfee in May found that cyber espionage was on the rise, with Chinese hackers stealing field data and cutting-edge technology from energy companies around the world since at least 2009.

75,OXY,Occidental moves quarterly dividend payment into 2012,"Dec 5 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp, the fourth-largest U.S. oil company, said on Wednesday it was bringing forward the payment of its dividend to 2012 instead of 2013. A number of companies have made similar moves because of worries about the U.S. government’s fiscal plans, with the potential for higher tax rates that would kick in next year. Occidental said its payment of 54 cents per share would be made on Dec. 27, 2012, instead of Jan. 15, 2013. “No other changes have been made to this previously declared quarterly dividend,” the company said in a statement.",12052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/occidentalpetroleum-dividend/occidental-moves-quarterly-dividend-payment-into-2012-idUSL1E8N5IWT20121205
76,OXY,Occidental shares up on detailed cost-cutting plans,"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) shares rose more than 2 percent on Tuesday as the fourth-largest U.S. oil company spelled out some of the early results of its cost-cutting efforts. “With regards to the reduction in our cash operating costs, we are running well ahead of plan,” said one slide accompanying a presentation by Chief Executive Stephen Chazen on Tuesday. “This should be noticeable in our 4Q12 results and become very visible in 1Q13.” Chazen began talking aggressively about costs in October alongside the company’s third-quarter results. According to the slide for the Goldman Sachs Global Energy Conference, Oxy would achieve $300 million in cash operating cost cuts this year and up to $450 million in actual savings compared with 2012. Savings stem from reductions in uneconomic down-hole maintenance and the cost of surface operations, among other things. Chazen also laid out a goal to reduce U.S. drilling costs by 15 percent in 2013 compared with last year and the slide said it was already about half-way there. The average number of U.S. rigs deployed would fall to 55 this year from 64 last year, although production of oil would continue to increase, it said. Occidental shares were up 2.5 percent at $81.90 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

77,OXY,UPDATE 2-Occidental Petroleum cost cuts yield Wall Street beat,"* Writes down value of midcontinent gas assets by $1.1 billion * Fourth-qtr adj profit $1.83 per share vs est $1.66 per share * Sees 8-10 pct growth in U.S. output of crude oil this year * Shares rise 3 pct to four-month highs By Braden Reddall Jan 31 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp’s  quarterly profit beat Wall Street estimates as the fourth-largest U.S. oil company hacked away at production costs, and it predicted growth of 8 percent to 10 percent in domestic crude output this year. The results boosted the company’s shares 3 percent on Thursday to four-month highs. Fourth-quarter costs fell by $1.04 per barrel from the third quarter as Oxy used fewer outside contractors and cut uneconomic maintenance activity, among other things. The cost-cutting program is aimed at reducing U.S. drilling costs by 15 percent in 2013, and the company is about half-way there. Most efforts are in its home state of California, which accounted for 35 percent of fourth-quarter production. Chief Executive Stephen Chazen said he was “stunned” by how well people in the field had responded to the push for savings, and expects the cost per barrel of oil equivalent, or boe, would fall below $14 from $14.99 for all of 2012. “There’s no plan that says every month you are going to fire 100 contractors or something,” Chazen said on a conference call. “We are trying to do it in a way that’s not done with a meat axe, but with a scalpel.” Overall, the company’s daily oil and gas production volumes rose 4 percent to average 779,000 boe in the fourth quarter. This included an average 475,000 boe per day of U.S. production. Oil prices, however, were weak in the quarter, with U.S. crude falling 6 percent from a year earlier to average $88.23 per barrel. International Brent averaged $110 per barrel, up just $1 per barrel from a year earlier. Occidental said its realized price for worldwide natural gas liquids, or NGLs, slumped 18 percent to $45.08 per barrel, while domestic gas prices decreased 14 percent in the same period. Almost all of the 6 percent reduction in capital spending this year, to $9.6 billion, would come in the United States, with much of it in California. The Los Angeles-based company plans to cut the number of U.S. rigs deployed to 55 this year from 64, even though oil production would still increase. Output of natural gas and NGLs would likely decline slightly, while international output looks set to be near flat for 2013, Chazen said. Just over one-tenth of Occidental’s capital spending this year would be devoted to the Shah gas field in Abu Dhabi, a $10 billion project in which Oxy has a 40 percent stake that a spokeswoman said was “on track” ahead of its start-up next year. Occidental reported a net profit of $336 million, or 45 cents per share, as it wrote down the value of gas properties in the U.S. midcontinent by $1.1 billion. The company’s midcontinent natural gas production comes mainly from the Hugoton Field in Kansas, Oklahoma and eastern Colorado and the Piceance Basin in western Colorado. Adjusted profit was $1.83 per share, above analysts’ estimates of $1.66, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 2 percent to $6.17 billion. Occidental shares were up 2.8 percent at $88.72 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Asked about mergers and acquisitions, Chazen said there was little on the horizon in terms of purchases in the Permian basin, where it is focused. He side-stepped with a joke a question on whether he would sell out of the high-priced Bakken region around North Dakota, where Oxy has cut rigs. “If somebody would like to buy my desk, if they pay the right price, they are more than welcome to it,” he said. “There’s not much in the drawers.” ",1312013,http://www.reuters.com/article/occidentalpetroleum-results/update-2-occidental-petroleum-cost-cuts-yield-wall-street-beat-idUSL4N0B06JY20130131

With executive chairman and ex-CEO Ray Irani due to retire at the end of 2014, a Chazen departure would mark the end of an era for the Los Angeles-based company. Both executives found themselves targeted over their high compensation, until a shareholder effort to take board seats sparked reform in 2010. Chazen ended up earning compensation worth $31.7 million in 2011, down from $38.1 million the year before, while Irani made $49.8 million in 2011, down from $76.1 million. The disclosures for 2012 have not yet been made. Chazen is only Occidental’s third CEO in half a century. Irani had been named CEO in 1990 by Armand Hammer, a flamboyant tycoon who spent three decades building the company from a small firm of just three employees. Shares of Occidental have fallen 15 percent in the past year, compared with a 10 percent rise for California rival Chevron Corp and 6 percent for giant Exxon Mobil Corp . A sweeping cost-cutting effort by Chazen over the past quarter helped the company report a fourth-quarter profit well ahead of analysts’ estimates last month. Earlier on Thursday, Occidental had announced an 18.5 percent increase in its annual dividend to $2.56 per share, for a compound annual dividend growth rate of 16 percent since 2002.

Those two events would also result in $100 million of additional costs in its fiscal first quarter and reduce oil and gas production by 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with the fourth quarter, according to slides released by the company on Monday Adding in production issues in the Middle East/North Africa region, first-quarter sales volumes would be down by about 40,000 bpd compared with the quarter before, according to the slides that will accompany Chief Executive Stephen Chazen’s presentation to the Howard Weil energy conference on Tuesday. The overall reduced sales are equivalent to about 5 percent of Occidental’s fourth-quarter oil and gas production, and will result in an after-tax $200 million reduction in earnings compared with the fourth quarter. Analysts had been expecting a first-quarter net profit of $1.4 billion, according to the average on Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The Wall Street Journal reported recently that Ray Irani, the oil company’s chairman and former long-time CEO, was pushing to replace Chazen, who is 66 years old. “All decisions regarding CEO succession planning were made over many meetings by the independent directors alone in executive session, in accordance with best governance practices,” the Occidental board said in a statement. “Dr. Irani did not attend, and did not play any role in, these meeting deliberations.” Shares of Occidental, the fourth-largest U.S. oil company, gave up an early gain to trade 1 percent lower on Monday following the announcement. Occidental said in mid-February that it was seeking a replacement for its CEO, who joined Occidental in 1994 and took over as CEO in mid-2011 after serving under Irani as chief financial officer for more than a decade. With Irani due to retire next year, a Chazen departure would mark the end of an era for the Los Angeles-based company. Irani took over in 1990 after tycoon Armand Hammer built it up from a small firm over three decades. “I am not aware of any differences between me and the Board as to the Company`s strategies,” Chazen said in the statement on Monday. “I did not ask to leave at this time, but I respect the Board`s decision to seek a new generation of leadership.” Irani, who is 78, confirmed that he would retire as executive chairman and as a board member at the end of 2014. The board said its deliberations over CEO succession did not involve or consider a change in the company’s strategy or long-term goals. “There were no schisms, nor philosophical divisions in the directors` decision,” the statement said. The company acknowledged that 2012 had presented challenges, including a disappointing stock performance and execution inefficiencies as the company ramped up production. Chazen acknowledged the ballooning costs publicly last October and set aggressive targets to reduce them, with early efforts yielding higher-than-expected profits for the fourth quarter. The board said its independent directors, responding to the turmoil of 2012, decided it was time to seek new leadership for the longer term, and retained a search firm to assist it.

91,OXY,RPT-Fitch Affirms Occidental's IDR at 'A'; Outlook Remains Positive,"April 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s (NYSE: OXY) ratings as follows: —Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘A’; —Senior Unsecured Revolver at ‘A’; —Senior Unsecured Notes at ‘A’; —Commercial paper at ‘F1’; —Short-term IDR at ‘F1’. The Rating Outlook remains Positive. Approximately $7.62 billion in debt is  affected by this rating action. Rating Rationale: OXY’s ratings reflect the company’s large size, strong  operational track record, diverse resource base, significant exposure to liquids  (approximately 72% of 2012 production and reserves), and historically robust  cash flow and low debt levels, which remain at the upper end of the range for  the ‘A’ category. The company also enjoys modest integration benefits from its  chemicals and midstream segment, and low geological risk, stemming from its  enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategy. Credit concerns center on uncertainty as to who might replace CEO Steve Chazen  and what changes, if any, a successor might make to OXY’s current financial  policies. This follows the unexpected announcement by OXY in February that it  had formed a search committee to find a successor to Chazen. Fitch viewed  Chazen’s appointment as CEO in 2011 as a positive for the credit, given the  conservatism of financial policy under his longstanding tenure as CFO. Other credit concerns center on the possibility of a leveraging transaction, the  need for periodic property acquisitions as part of the company’s EOR model, and  transparency issues associated with commodities trader Phibro. The high level of  investor activism in the energy sector is also a background concern. Recent Financial Performance: OXY’s latest 12 months (LTM) financial performance  has been strong, prompted by high oil prices. As calculated by Fitch, for the  period ending Dec. 31, 2012, OXY generated EBITDA of $14.05 billion, resulting  in debt/EBITDA leverage of just 0.5 times (x), EBITDA/gross interest coverage of  55.3x, and FFO-interest coverage of 49.1x. Free cash flow was -$1.042 billion,  comprised of cash flow from operations of $11.35 billion, minus capex of $10.23  billion and common dividends of $2.13 billion. The modestly negative FCF was  driven by a combination of higher capex spending for long-term projects,  accelerated dividend payments to shareholders in Q4, and higher production costs  during the year. Similar to other producers in 2012, OXY took a non-cash  impairment of approximately $1.7 billion linked to low gas prices. Fitch expects OXY’s historically strong FCF to be muted in 2013, given the  relatively high percentage of capex earmarked for long term projects that will  not cash flow immediately. Approximately 25% of the company’s 2013 capex budget  of $9.6 billion is earmarked for such projects, including the Al Hosn gas  project in Abu Dhabi, the 300,000 bpd BridgeTex pipeline in Texas, and a new  182,500 tons per year chlor-alki plant in Tennessee. Upstream Performance: OXY’s 2012 operational metrics were good. Total output for  the year rose by 4.6%, from 732,800 boepd to 766,300 boepd. Total proven  reserves rose by approximately 3.8% from 3.175 to 3.296 billion boe. As  calculated by Fitch, Oxy’s 2012 organic and all-in reserve replacement ratios  (RRR) were a respectable 109% and 143%. These figures include revisions of  approximately 180 million boe linked to low gas prices which we expect could be  reversed in future years. Net of these revisions, RRRs would have been 175% and  209% respectively. At year-end 2012 approximately 900 million boe of OXY’s  reserves were PSC-linked. 2012 full cycle netbacks as calculated by Fitch were  respectable at $18.08/boe. Liquidity: OXY’s liquidity is robust. Cash on hand at year end was $1.59  billion, and the company’s $2 billion credit facility (maturing 2016) remained  untapped. Covenant restrictions on the revolver are light and exclude MAC  clauses or ratings triggers.  The revolver also has a $1 billion sub limit for  Letters of Credit (LCs). Near-term maturities are light and include $600 million  in 1.45% notes due this year and no major maturities following that until 2016. Other Liabilities: OXY’s other obligations are manageable. The company’s 2012  Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) increased to $1.266 billion from $1.09 billion  the year prior, due in part to acquisitions and new liabilities incurred. Total  rental expense in 2012 was $180 million and was primarily linked to leases for  transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, and office space.  Environmental reserves declined to $344 million at year-end 2012 and covered  probable remediation costs at 161 sites. The funding deficit on the company’s  pension at year-end 2012 was negative $116 million, which is very modest when  scaled to OXY’s underlying cash flows. Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: —Continued strong operational performance and low debt levels (debt/boe 1p<  $2.50 and debt/flowing barrel< $12,000), accompanied by evidence the company  will keep its very conservative financial policy in place under new leadership Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: —A change in philosophy on use of the balance sheet; —A sustained collapse in crude prices without offsetting adjustments to the  capital program; —A large increase in the scope of Phibro’s trading activities.",4172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-affirms-occidentals-idr-at-a-outlo/rpt-fitch-affirms-occidentals-idr-at-a-outlook-remains-positive-idUSFit65509520130417

The technically challenging project to process around 1 billion cubic feet a day (bcf/d) of sour gas into 0.5 bcf/d of usable gas in the remote desert is vital to temper the UAE’s growing gas imports. As well as clean gas for industry and power generation, the project will produce significant volumes of condensate, a light oil, and large quantities of sulphur powder which will be taken by rail to the Gulf port of Ruwais for export.

93,OXY,"UPDATE 2-Occidental Q1 profit beats, weighs moves to boost stock","* First-quarter earnings/share ex items $1.69 vs est $1.54 * Cost cut program offsets lower natural gas prices * Weighs buybacks, asset moves due to lower share price * Stock rises 3.7 pct to 2-month high By Braden Reddall and Siddharth Cavale April 25 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp  posted a higher-than-expected profit as cost cuts blunted the impact of low natural gas prices, while the fourth-largest U.S. oil company weighs various efforts to boost its lagging stock price. Shares of Occidental rose 3.7 percent to a two-month high on Thursday, but they are still down about 3 percent in the past year, compared with a 15 percent rise for California rival Chevron Corp. Occidental Chief Executive Stephen Chazen, who would not comment on the timing of his departure while the board seeks the 66-year-old’s eventual replacement, said the lower stock price meant there would “probably” be share buybacks in its future. Chazen said a weaker stock value also meant he would have to take a harder look at possibly selling parts of the company or hiving assets off into tax-favorable master limited partnerships (MLP), though he wanted any such deals to move the needle. “I do not want to go down the path of a sort of delicatessen approach to this where you slice a piece of baloney off and throw it to the wolves,” he told analysts on a conference call. Besides the United States, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Occidental’s production, the company has assets in Latin America and the Middle East. Asked by one analyst about a potential move with its Middle East business as an example, Chazen talked hypothetically of splitting the entire thing as being easier than selling off one country at a time, which would require approvals. There was “no shortage of suggestions” for deals to make, he added. “You start looking for things that move the needle a lot, rather than things to fine-tune,” Chazen said, characterizing an MLP as fine-tuning. Breakingviews story on potential Oxy moves The company is fending off reports of a “fight at the top”, which led its board to publish a statement this month denying any conflict and explaining that its search for a new CEO was part of a succession plan. Occidental’s first-quarter net profit fell to $1.36 billion, or $1.68 per share, from $1.56 billion, or $1.92 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it made $1.69 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.54 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 6 percent to $5.87 billion in the quarter. Chazen said the company was ahead of schedule with its cost-cutting program unveiled last October and aimed at reducing U.S. drilling costs by 15 percent this year, a response to a tough 2012 in which costs escalated along with production increases. U.S. operating costs fell to $14.06 per barrel in the first quarter from $16.44 per barrel a year earlier. Most of the cost-cutting effort is focused on California, which accounts for about a third of its oil and gas output. “The highlight was impressive progress on cost reduction initiatives,” analysts at Simmons & Co wrote. “Total company production was slightly below our expectation.” Daily oil and gas production averaged 763,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in the quarter, up from 755,000 boe a year ago. Oxy said oil prices rose 2 percent from the fourth quarter, while natural gas prices fell 11 percent on the same basis.

94,OXY,"WRAPUP 1-U.S. oil production rises for Exxon, Conoco in Q1","* Exxon’s U.S. oil output up 2 percent * Occidental’s domestic output hits record * Exxon shares down nearly 1 percent By Anna Driver HOUSTON, April 25 (Reuters) - Quarterly results from Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips on Thursday showed that while overall growth remained elusive, output rose in key basins in the United States where the oil and gas companies are spending heavily to grow crude production. North American shale basins and the Gulf of Mexico are seen as more secure places for energy companies to invest because they typically offer a steady source of growth. Conoco said in December that more than half of its nearly $16 billion budget for 2013 will be spent in North America. Exxon’s U.S. oil and natural gas liquids production rose 2 percent in the first quarter, compared with an overall output decline of 3.5 percent. “Lower production at Exxon is an ongoing trend, they need so many projects to come online to offset field decline,” said Brian Youngberg, energy company analyst at Edward Jones. “But Conoco’s shift toward the U.S. continues to proceed well.” Conoco said oil and gas production rose a combined 42 percent in the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Texas’ Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. Conoco’s total output from continuing operations edged 1 percent lower. Fourth-largest U.S. oil company Occidental Petroleum Corp  said its daily domestic oil and gas production rose to a record 478,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe), most of which was oil or natural gas liquids. Exxon’s quarterly profit edged up, helped by higher earnings in its chemicals business but oil and gas production fell. Earnings per share for the world’s largest publicly traded oil company topped Wall Street expectations but the gains largely came after a big stock buyback reduced the number of outstanding shares. Analysts at Credit Suisse characterized it as a “weak” beat in a note to clients. Exxon said it will lower its quarterly share buyback to $4 billion in the second quarter, below the $5 billion in the first quarter. First-quarter profit for the world’s largest publicly traded oil company was $2.12 per share. Analysts, on average, expected the Irving, Texas, company to report a profit of $2.05 per share. Conoco’s first-quarter results met Wall Street expectations and Occidental beat the Street, helped by higher profits in its midstream and marketing business and lower costs, analysts said. Conoco had a first-quarter profit of $2.1 billion, or $1.73 per share, down from $2.9 billion, or $2.27 per share, a year earlier. Occidental reported a first-quarter net profit of $1.36  billion, or $1.68 per share, compared with $1.56 billion, or $1.92 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the Los Angeles company earned $1.69 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.54 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

95,OXY,Occidental Petroleum cost cuts help profit to beat Wall Street,"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), the fourth-largest U.S. oil company, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as it cut costs to blunt the impact of low natural gas prices. Los Angeles-based Occidental said operating costs in the United States, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the company’s production in the first quarter, fell to $14.06 per barrel from $16.44 per barrel a year earlier. Chief Executive Stephen Chazen announced a cost-cutting program in October with the aim of reducing U.S. drilling costs by 15 percent this year, a response to a tough 2012 in which costs escalated and the company’s stock underperformed. “To date, (we) are running ahead of our full-year objectives in our program to improve domestic operational and capital efficiencies,” Chazen said in a statement. The company plans to cut the number of U.S. rigs it deploys to 55 this year from 64. Most of the cost-cutting effort is focused on California, which accounts for about a third of the company’s oil and gas production.

Oppenheimer & Co. said in a recent research note that last week certain analysts attended group meetings with Chazen in which he discussed different restructuring scenarios. “OXY could announce within three months plans to spin off its international operations,” Oppenheimer said, predicting an estimated $20 billion from that sale could be used to buy back 25 percent of its shares. The company’s California and Permian basin assets in New Mexico and Texas could be spun off into separate companies, the analysts added, as they raised their price target on Occidental’s stock to $115 from $100 on the potential restructuring impact. Occidental did not respond to a request for comment. Apart from its South American interests in Bolivia and Colombia, Occidental has operations in seven countries in the Middle East and North Africa, from Libya to Iraq to Yemen. One reason the assets may be on the block is the departure last month of the company’s long-serving Lebanon-born chairman, Ray Irani, after shareholders voted him out. “He had strong contacts there, which in the past served the company very well,” Youngberg said, noting that political turmoil in the Arab world over the past few years had made it less attractive for many U.S. investors. Chazen said on April 25 that Occidental’s stock underperformance meant he would take a hard look at sizable deals to realize value for the company. “I do not want to go down the path of a sort of delicatessen approach to this where you slice a piece of baloney off and throw it to the wolves,” he told analysts on a conference call. Credit Suisse analysts saw what they called a “Potential Three Way Break Up” in which the California unit - valued at $22 billion - would also be spun out, leaving Oxy’s Permian assets attached to its pipeline, oil trading, storage and chemicals businesses.

Mosaic Co stock was among the biggest drags on the S&P; 500, sinking 18.1 percent to $43.38 after Russia’s Uralkali  dismantled one of the world’s largest potash partnerships by pulling out of a venture with its partner in Belarus, a move it expects will drive global prices down 25 percent. Occidental Petroleum Corp shares tumbled more than 3 percent and helped pull down the S&P; 500 after the company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit, hurt by lower oil prices in the Middle East and North Africa.Its stock dropped 3.4 percent to $87.49.

Chief Executive Steve Chazen indicated in April that Occidental’s Middle East operations might be put up for sale , and analysts also expect the California division to be spun off. Chazen said on Tuesday that various options for reshaping the company were being evaluated by the board of directors. “The board has really just been exposed to this in detail at one meeting, and so it will take a little while,” he said on a conference call with analysts, adding that more information would be available toward the end of the year. Shareholders ousted Executive Chairman Ray Irani in May, ending his more than two-decade run at the company and giving Chazen a free hand. Occidental said oil and gas production volumes rose nearly 1 percent in the second quarter, to 772,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, due to surging output in Texas’ Permian Basin and California. Volumes at the company’s international operations declined due to insurgency in Colombia. Occidental gets about two-thirds of its oil and gas output in the United States, and Chazen said second-half U.S. production would be 2 to 3 percent higher than the first-half’s 262,000 boe per day. The company’s second-quarter net profit was $1.32 billion, or $1.64 per share, little changed from a year earlier. Adjusted profit was $1.58 per share, 2 cents below analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3 percent to $5.96 billion. Occidental said crude oil prices in the Middle East and North Africa fell 7 percent in the quarter, while U.S. prices rose 3 percent. The company, which is aiming to reduce U.S. drilling costs by 15 percent this year, has cut them by 21 percent so far in 2013. The Los Angeles-based company offered extensive details on its California operations on the conference call, feeding speculation that it may spin off that unit, which regularly faces tougher government scrutiny than elsewhere. “We want to make sure that the California company has stable, solid cash flow going forward, and the regulatory environment will take a while to develop,” Chazen said. “This is not North Dakota.” Occidental shares fell nearly 3 percent to $87.90 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Monday, the stock had risen 18 percent this year.

115,OXY,Passive fund manager Vanguard turns activist in some board votes,"Sept 13 (Reuters) - Fund manager Vanguard Group Inc opposed the election of board members in a number of high-profile proxy contests this year, votes that help explain why directors at firms such as Hewlett-Packard Co and Occidental Petroleum Corp had a hard time getting re-elected. While Vanguard continued to support the vast majority of directors, its votes come at a time when institutional investors, which in the past often followed management’s wishes or outsourced proxy voting responsibilities, are increasingly exercising more influence. In the 2013 proxy season, funds run by the $2.3 trillion investment company opposed five of seven directors targeted by the AFL-CIO labor federation, according to recent filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The labor group had opposed six directors at other companies between 2010 and 2012 as well, but Pennsylvania-based Vanguard backed the directors in those contests. Vanguard also switched sides at several other contested shareholder meetings flagged by proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. ISS said in a report last month that fiercely contested proxy battles at companies like Hewlett-Packard and Occidental “made it the worst of times” for some directors. Hewlett-Packard directors John Hammergren and G. Kennedy Thompson left its board in April after receiving just narrow majorities of shareholder votes. At Occidental’s annual meeting in April, shareholders ousted Chairman Ray Irani and another director, Aziz Syriani, withdrew from the election. Vanguard funds, like its $142 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund, opposed all four after supporting them in 2012. A spokesman for Hewlett-Packard declined to comment on Vanguard’s voting. A spokesman for Occidental could not be  immediately reached. The votes of managers such as Vanguard have a wide-ranging impact on U.S. companies because of the vast holdings of their funds. With about $1.4 trillion of equity assets, for instance, Vanguard is the top institutional investor in market leaders like ExxonMobil, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp . “You can’t take them for granted,” said fund industry consultant Burt Greenwald, referring to passive managers. Also, index funds can turn activist because they cannot simply sell shares of companies with which they are unhappy and take what Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors in Washington, called “the Wall Street Walk.” “If you can’t sell your shares, you look for other ways to hold portfolio companies accountable,” Borrus said. Glenn Booraem, Vanguard’s head of proxy voting, declined to discuss votes at individual companies and downplayed the overall significance of the switched votes on directors. He said it “just means with the passage of an additional year of both behavior and engagement, we reached a different voting conclusion.” Booraem said he speaks with hundreds of executives every year to press Vanguard’s views behind the scenes. He said he often tells them that as an index fund manager, “We’re going to be practically permanent shareholders. We’re not going away.” Vanguard supported 95 percent of company directors overall, up from 94 percent in 2012. But in addition to the votes at Hewlett-Packard and Occidental, filings for Vanguard funds show they switched sides and opposed directors at other companies where board members faced criticism. These included Cablevision, Apple Inc,  Nabors Industries and Vornado Realty Trust. - the latter three of which were identified as “top meetings” by ISS, along with Hewlett-Packard and Occidental. John Coates, a Harvard Law School professor who follows corporate governance, said Vanguard’s votes are in line with a new consensus among institutional investors that voting against directors puts more pressure on companies than does voting for specific shareholder proposals. “It’s becoming conventional wisdom that’s the best way to get the board’s attention,” Coates said.

117,OXY,"Lured by Texas talent, Occidental strays from California roots","(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) may still be headquartered in Los Angeles, as it has been since being founded nearly a century ago, but its center of gravity is shifting to Houston, capital of the U.S. energy industry. While the fourth-largest U.S. oil company would not disclose the number of employees based in either city, a LinkedIn search reveals 286 people who list Oxy as their current employer in Los Angeles, compared with 1,491 in Houston. Occidental’s Texas presence is growing larger still. A search of 287 U.S. jobs listed by the company on www.oxy.com found 65 in Houston - ranging from senior engineers to software administrators. Most of the rest were at field operations in California and elsewhere in Texas. As for Los Angeles, there was a single opening last month, for a security officer, and now there is one for an accountant. The trend suggests just how far the California corporate stalwart has strayed from its roots in order to grab the deep oil-industry talent available in Houston. It also highlights a shift in jobs growth generally in Texas over the Golden State. “The geologists, the geophysicists, the petroleum engineers - they tend to concentrate in one place. If you’re looking for those skills and want to compete for those skills, you have to go to that spot,” said Robert Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston’s Bauer College of Business. “If you want people who have film and movie skills, you go to Hollywood.” So the head of Oxy’s Americas unit, Bill Albrecht, has worked out of Houston since last year, and its recently appointed general counsel, Marcia Backus, will be “primarily based in Houston,” an Oxy spokeswoman said. With U.S. energy companies ramping up their hiring to tap the country’s fast-growing new oil and gas resources, ensuring access to skills clearly outweighs a firm’s legacy in any given location. Oxy is just one of several energy companies expanding their presence in Houston, helping fuel an office property boom not seen in years. Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Phillips 66 (PSX.N) are building new office developments in Houston. And California’s largest and oldest energy company, Chevron Corp (CVX.N), made headlines late last year with plans to relocate 850 jobs to Houston while it builds a brand-new tower to complement its already substantial presence there. Other energy-focused companies have moved headquarters out of California entirely, bound for Texas. Fluor Corp (FLR.N), an engineering company now based outside Dallas, had called California’s Orange County home until 2006. Calpine Corp CPN.N, now a Houston-based power company, abandoned San Jose three years later. “We do not have any current plans to move our corporate headquarters out of Los Angeles,” the Oxy spokeswoman said. Yet when Oxy extended its lease in Houston in March, a leasing executive for the owner of the complex said in a statement that its ability to “provide space for Occidental to grow over the years and our flexibility to accommodate future growth were important considerations for the lease renewal.” Allen Good, who follows Oxy for Morningstar, an independent research outfit, said the deeper talent pool in Houston is not the only reason behind the shift of employees - there are also factors like lower living costs and income taxes. The average price of a home in Houston, for one, is less than half the Los Angeles average, and any such savings are attractive both to workers and the people who have to pay their wages. Other data indicates that many Californians, and not just oil industry employees, have already made the move. A Tax Foundation analysis of personal income moving in and out of states found Texas was the most popular destination for California income over the period from 1993 to 2010. Occidental is still ranked as the third-most-valuable company in Southern California, and the name of Armand Hammer, who oversaw its global expansion after a big California discovery in 1961, adorns a popular West Los Angeles art museum. Even so, the company is busy shoring up local relations in Houston. Last month the Houston Astros baseball team hosted more than 2,000 Occidental employees and family members at Community Leader Occidental Night to celebrate a new partnership with the Astros Foundation to refurbish Houston playing fields. Occidental, whose chief executive officer is a Vietnam veteran, is even sponsoring a salute to the military at every Astros home game this year. CEO Steve Chazen has his own roots in Texas as a University of Houston alumnus who, according to public records, also owns a condominium in Galveston on the Texas coast. Oxy’s California connection may soon disappear in any case. The company is exploring a potential spinout of its California operations into a separate company - which would leave its U.S. focus largely in the Permian basin that straddles New Mexico and Texas. California represents a third of Oxy’s U.S. oil and gas production, while the Permian accounts for about 45 percent. Morningstar’s Good expects more clarity by the end of this year on plans for a California spinoff and any deal for the company’s Middle East operations, which should both at least be set in motion before Chazen steps down at the end of 2014. Oxy is looking to sell a minority stake in holdings that range from Libya to Iraq to Yemen and could be worth as much as $20 billion, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

119,OXY,UPDATE 2-Occidental plans sale of Middle East oil stake,"* Plans to sell interest in Middle East, North African assets * Considering options for some U.S. assets * Plans to sell stake in Plains All American Pipeline for $1.3 bln * Shares fall 1.4 percent   (Adds analyst comment, share price) Oct 18 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp said on Friday it plans to sell a minority stake in its Middle East and North African operations, part of a restructuring meant to lift its valuation. The company also said it was considering strategic alternatives for some oil and gas assets in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region, which have lower returns. It did not specify what options. Occidental has spoken openly since April about striking a deal to reduce its exposure to the politically volatile Middle East and North Africa, part of a broader plan to split up the fourth-largest U.S oil company. “Our goal is to become a somewhat smaller company with more manageable exposure to political risk,” Chief Executive Stephen Chazen said in a statement. Shares of Occidental fell 1.4 percent after the announcement as some investors hoped for more details about the restructuring. Wells Fargo analysts noted there was no information about what the company plans to do with its California assets or whether the it intends to divest oil fields in Latin America. Analysts briefed by the company have said Occidental’s California unit, which analysts at Credit Suisse value around $22 billion, may eventually be spun off to investors. Its assets across the Middle East, which include oilfields in Libya, Iraq and Yemen, could be worth between $15 billion and $20 billion, analysts have said. Chazen has started talking to sovereign wealth funds and other potential investors about possible investments in the Middle East unit, Reuters reported last month, citing sources. Occidental’s Rocky Mountain assets include low-return gas properties such as the Hugoton field in Kansas, Oklahoma and eastern Colorado, the Piceance basin in western Colorado, and higher-cost oil fields in the Williston basin in North Dakota. “OXY has prioritized development in the Permian and California over the Midcontinent as returns and profitability in the Permian and California are more attractive in the current environment,” analysts at Houston based energy investment bank Simmons & Co told clients in a note. The company also said its board had authorized the sale of part of its 35 percent stake in the general partner of pipeline company Plains All American Pipeline LP for pre-tax proceeds of about $1.3 billion. Occidental’s remaining interest in Plains All American Pipeline, based on the initial public offering price, was worth about $3.4 billion, the company said. Sale proceeds along with excess cash will be used to reduce the company’s capitalization, likely through what analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co characterized as a “sizable” stock repurchase of greater than 10 percent of outstanding shares. Occidental’s shares fell $1.42 to $96.66 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

125,OXY,Exclusive: Gulf firms consider bid for Occidental MidEast stake - sources,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Three state-owned Gulf firms are considering a joint bid for a minority stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp’s (OXY.N) Middle East and North Africa (MENA) unit, a deal that could be worth between $8 billion and $10 billion, three banking sources said. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development Co MUDEV.UL, Qatar Petroleum QATPE.UL and Oman Oil Co have formed a consortium and have picked Citigroup (C.N) to advise them, the sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday. They spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. Occidental, the fourth-largest U.S. oil company, said in October it planned to sell a minority stake in its MENA operations as part of a restructuring meant to lift its valuation. On Monday two of the sources said it could sell a 40 percent stake to the three Gulf firms. Occidental and Qatar Petroleum were not immediately available for comment, while Citi and Mubadala declined to comment. Oman Oil could not be reached for comment. Occidental’s planned sale fits a trend of U.S. oil companies disposing of assets elsewhere in the world in order to tilt strategy towards the shale gas boom in North America. ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is offloading assets in Kazakhstan, Algeria and Nigeria in deals generating around $9 billion in total. The proposal from the Gulf marks a rare three-way collaboration between state-owned energy firms. One of the stumbling blocks to any deal will be how the trio overcome political hurdles to managing its acquisition, one of the sources said. Among the positives - given the cost associated with buying the stake on offer, it is unlikely that other bidders will emerge to challenge them. “The stake is pretty big for a single buyer. It was always a deal which made sense for a consortium to look at but this is not a done deal yet and there are several dynamics to it which needs to be addressed,” the source, a Gulf-based banker, said. “We don’t see much international interest for an asset like this and the chances of another consortium being formed are limited but not impossible.” The Middle East accounts for more than a third of Occidental’s worldwide oil and gas production with net developed and undeveloped oil and gas assets in the region totaling more than 15 million acres, according to its website. Among its assets are the Al Hosn Gas Project in the United Arab Emirates, one of the largest natural gas fields in the region which it is developing in a joint venture with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. The firm also has assets in Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Iraq, Yemen and Libya.

130,OXY,Analysis: Lobbying fight over U.S. oil exports may be one-sided battle,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the most important U.S. energy policy lobbying debates this year is shaping up as a remarkably one-sided fight. While a growing number of groups support ending a decades-old U.S. law that effectively bans crude oil exports, few companies and lobbyists publicly oppose the idea. On Tuesday, top oil refiner Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) became the first major company to publicly oppose relaxing the restrictions, a seemingly predictable stance from an industry that has reaped the huge benefits of buying cheaper U.S. crude oil and selling it as refined fuels, often abroad. But some of Valero’s natural allies in the fight are steering clear, not wishing to compromise their free-market ideals in defense of a policy that most energy analysts and experts say has become a remnant of a bygone era. “We don’t oppose lifting the crude-oil export ban, as we fully support free markets,” Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) spokeswoman Stefanie Griffith said in an emailed statement. Phillips 66 (PSX.N) says exports of crude oil and other products “are good for our country and contribute to a strong balance of trade,” a spokesman said on Tuesday. The U.S. trade deficit fell to a four-year low in November thanks to shrinking net petroleum imports, government data showed this week. The refiners’ lobby group, which helped lead a highly contentious but successful campaign last year to relax the U.S. ethanol mandates, is sticking to its free-market mantra despite the objections of some of its members, Charles Drevna, president of American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, told Reuters this month. U.S. domestic shipping industry executives privately voice support for the ban, but the industry at large has been reluctant to take a position. The shipping industry is benefiting from a surge in rates for U.S.-flagged tankers, which are required by law to move petroleum products between U.S. ports. There is still time for more foes to emerge, of course. Environmental groups that have sought to block coal exports and the Keystone XL pipeline may take up the issue more seriously. Ahead of mid-term elections, some politicians may raise the specter of higher gasoline prices, as New Jersey Democratic Senator Robert Menendez did in a letter to President Barack Obama last month. But without a cohesive lobbying force, even industry insiders see little standing in the way of rising exports. Thanks to the rise in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies, U.S. crude oil production has surged to the highest level in 25 years, threatening to inundate refiners with a light sweet crude that is easy to refine. As a result, domestic oil prices have fallen to a discount versus similar varieties elsewhere, spurring calls to ease an export ban imposed in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo. Understandably, big producers such as independent Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N) and oil major Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) were the first to call for a review of the ban. U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz last year said the export ban should be reassessed by the Department of Commerce, which regulates licensing. More surprising is the lack of unanimity among refiners. “I would have thought the independent refiners would stay sort of united on this,” said Chi Chow, refining industry analyst at Macquarie Group. “It’s definitely in their economic interest to keep the ban in place,” he said. The battle has echoes of a similar war over the past two years, as natural gas producers sought government approval for exporting liquefied natural gas - over the objection of big consumers such as Dow Chemical Co DOW.N. But while industrial gas users mounted a compelling macro-economic argument to restrain exports - lower domestic prices will create more jobs - refiners are on a shakier footing given bumper profits and gasoline prices that remain high by historical standards. Exporting crude is unlikely to have a major impact on local pump prices, energy experts say. “My interest is not to protect the refineries’ bottom line,” Senator Lisa Murkowski, the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee, said on Tuesday after urging a review of the ban. “They are going to have to deal with it within the industry.” America’s Energy Advantage, the coalition of companies led by Dow that opposed unfettered LNG exports, has not taken a position yet on crude exports and does not plan to weigh in on the discussion at this point, spokesman Brock Park said. The coalition appears to be losing that battle: the Obama administration has approved four new requests to export LNG to non-free trade countries in the past year, and is expected to approve more this year, analysts say. For refiners, any public effort to oppose exporting crude could draw more attention to their unfettered overseas shipments of refined fuels like gasoline and diesel, sales of which have trebled over the past 10 years to record highs. A Reuters-IPSOS poll conducted in November showed that American voters are almost evenly divided on the question of U.S. oil exports. But a majority believe gasoline exports should be restricted. A handful of lawmakers have already spoken out in opposition of the ban, including New Jersey’s Menendez and Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. But the balance of power in Washington may be shifting. Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, a major energy state, is expected to take Democratic Oregon Senator Ron Wyden’s place on the committee. She recently suggested she would support lifting the ban if “scientific data” showed it necessary. While opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline, such as 350.org, are already lining up to oppose crude oil exports, other environmental groups have yet to craft an approach - even as the debate rapidly accelerates in Washington. The Natural Resources Defense Council “hasn’t been engaged on the issue of oil exports specifically,” said Kate Slusark Kiely, a spokeswoman for the group. She said the group is focused on “protecting people and the environment from the risks involved with its development and use.” The U.S. shipping industry would seem a likely opponent of change. With overseas shipments restricted, oil producers have scrambled to secure so-called “Jones Act” tankers, the small fleet of U.S.-owned, U.S.-made, and U.S.-crewed vessels that are allowed to carry goods between U.S. ports. Rates for Jones Act tankers and barges owned by companies such as Kirby Corp (KEX.N) and American Petroleum Tankers - being bought by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners KMP.N - have surged as a growing glut of south Texas crude is shipped to other U.S. ports. If exports were allowed, demand could wane. One executive at a U.S.-flag ship company, who declined to be named, said that he was “fully supportive of the law.” Yet the American Maritime Partnership, which represents the U.S. domestic maritime industry, does not have a position on crude exports, spokesman Joe Brenckle said. With Jones Act rates already three times more expensive than foreign-flagged vessels, industry officials may worry about becoming a target of the debate themselves. “I think there’s a fear of being seen as anti-competitive or protectionist. It’s a challenge when you compare the rates of, say an MR Jones Act tanker versus a similarly sized international vessel,” said Ben Nolan, director of maritime research at Stifel, Nicolaus & Company in Chicago. The industry would make unlikely bedfellows with refiners, who have long complained that the Jones Act law inflates costs for refiners on the East Coast. “If indeed this is truly the beginning of the debate, let’s make sure the debate includes all the parameters so we fully understand the ramifications of other obstacles of economic growth,” said Drevna of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. “We can’t look at crude exports in a vacuum. We should also look at the Jones Act and how that hampers development.” ",1082014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crude-exports-analysis/analysis-lobbying-fight-over-u-s-oil-exports-may-be-one-sided-battle-idUSBREA070I320140108

More efficient drilling and higher domestic crude prices also helped Occidental to increase its profit in the fourth quarter, despite a decline in production from its Middle Eastern fields and severe winter weather in the United States. Occidental, which is looking to sell a minority stake in its Middle East business, said realized U.S. crude prices rose 8 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, helping the company to a net profit of $1.64 billion. At $2.04 per share, earnings were significantly higher than the 42 cents per share earned a year earlier, when the company wrote down the value of gas properties in the U.S. midcontinent by $1.1 billion. Even excluding the one-time gain and an after-tax charge of $395 million related to the impairment of some domestic oil and gas assets, Occidental earned $1.72 per share in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Net sales were flat at $6.17 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.67 per share on revenue of about $5.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Occidental sold more than it produced,” said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov. “It took volumes out of inventory, and that’s why it beat estimates.” Los Angeles-based Occidental said output in the fourth quarter fell to 750,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) from 779,000 boe/d a year earlier. But sales volumes exceeded production due to the timing of shipments from the company’s international operations, mainly in Iraq. Occidental said in October that it planned to sell a minority stake in its Middle East and North African operations, as well as announcing strategic alternatives for some assets in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region, which have lower returns. In the fourth quarter, Occidental also recorded a $665 million after-tax gain from the sale of part of its stake in the general partner of pipeline company Plains All American Pipeline LP. The company’s realized price for U.S. crude in the fourth quarter rose to $94.52 per barrel, while worldwide crude gained 3 percent to $99.27 per barrel and domestic gas prices jumped 8 percent.

Wall Street analysts have estimated the underperforming California unit, which Occidental had talked about splitting from for months, could be worth $19 billion to $22 billion. New York-traded shares of Occidental rose 3.5 percent on Friday to $95.51, giving the fourth-largest U.S. oil company a market capitalization of $72 billion. Occidental said the California unit generated a pretax profit of about $1.5 billion in 2013. “Creating two separate energy companies will result in more focused businesses that will be competitive industry leaders,”  Chief Executive Stephen Chazen said on Friday. The California unit, the largest natural gas producer in the state, has long been seen as a drag on the company because of its limited oil production. Total production growth averaged 3.6 percent between 2010 and 2013. The California fields produced an average 261 million cubic feet of gas and 88,000 barrels of oil per day in 2013. Although natural gas prices have risen recently due to cold weather in North America, prices have been weak over the past few years because of a flood of production from shale fields. Occidental is increasingly focusing on production from fields in the Permian Basis in Texas and New Mexico, far from Los Angeles where the company was founded nearly a century ago. The formal migration of Occidental to Texas, a move Reuters flagged as likely late last year, follows several other departures from California to the Lone Star state by big companies in the energy industry. Texas Governor Rick Perry welcomed the shift, saying it was only fitting that the state’s biggest oil producer should be based in “the energy capital of the world.” Perry, a Republican, has run television ads in states that are traditional Democratic strongholds to lure companies to Texas, pitching it as a low-tax, low-regulation environment for “creative renegades.” Fluor Corp, an engineering company now based outside Dallas, had called California’s Orange County home until 2006. Calpine Corp, now a Houston-based power company, abandoned San Jose three years later. After Occidental’s move, Chevron Corp. will be the only big oil company with headquarters in California. The company has also said it will sell a minority stake in its Middle East and North Africa operations. “We are of the view that the Mid-East/North Africa monetization should be even more needle-moving... reflecting the fact that these assets are perceived by the market as particularly idiosyncratic,” Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an email. Occidental said it expected to complete the separation of the unit, which will likely carry debt of $4 billion to $5 billion, by the end of 2014 or early 2015. The California unit produces oil and gas on holdings covering 2.1 million net acres. Occidental also said on Friday that it would reduce proprietary trading in crude oil and other commodities, which analysts have said create volatility in quarterly earnings. The company did not say how this would affect Phibro, its proprietary business. U.S. oil and gas producers such as Hess Corp and Chesapeake Energy Corp are streamlining their operations and investing more in the most profitable shale fields in North America to increase shareholder returns. Occidental said on Thursday that it would sell $1.4 billion of natural gas assets in the central United States and use part of the funds to buy back another 30 million shares. The company also raised its dividend. The company said Chazen would remain president and CEO through 2016, extending his tenure by two years. It also said that Chairman Edward Djerejian, who was elected last May after the ousting of predecessor Ray Irani, had been asked to remain in the role for another year.",2142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/occidentalpetroleum-california/update-4-occidental-to-spin-off-california-assets-move-hq-to-houston-idUSL3N0LJ4CW20140214

139,OXY,California city halts new oil drilling over fracking concerns,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 19 (Reuters) - The council of the Los Angeles County city of Carson, California, has unanimously approved a 45-day moratorium on new oil and gas drilling, a setback for Occidental Petroleum’s plans to drill more than 200 new wells there and the latest example of local governments taking a stand against fracking. Occidental originally presented its plan to drill new wells in the Dominquez Oil Field in Carson in 2012. At the time it said it planned to use hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to reach an estimated 52 million barrels of oil trapped below ground in the area. Fracking consists of injecting water, sand and chemicals deep underground at high pressure to break apart rock and release oil and gas into a well. Its use has helped spur an energy boom across the United States. Occidental’s plans were met with resistance from the Carson community, which voiced concern about the impact fracking could have on local air and water quality. When two test wells currently operating at the Dominquez project showed fracking would not effectively increase production, Occidental withdrew fracking from the project’s scope, Occidental spokeswoman Susie Geiger said. Despite that, the city council approved the moratorium on new oil drilling by a vote of 5-0 late Tuesday to give city officials time to consider additional regulations. “There are too many questions, too many unknowns and too many possible bad consequences that could result from the city engaging in this activity,” said Albert Robles, the Carson council member who led the moratorium charge. “These questions significantly outweigh any possible benefit to the residents of Carson.” The city council will consider a one-year moratorium after the 45-day period is up, Robles said. Environmental groups, which held a rally outside city hall prior to Tuesday’s vote, expressed concerns that Occidental would later decide to frack or use other controversial drilling techniques like acidization. They said they hope the moratorium will eventually lead to an outright ban on all new oil and gas production in Carson. Geiger said it was unclear what impact the moratorium would have on Occidental’s plans for the project. She said the project would provide well-paying jobs and increased tax revenue for Carson, Los Angeles County and the state. The vote in Carson is the latest example of local governments moving to take a closer look at fracking after a bill that sought to bring the practice to a halt failed to pass the California state legislature last year. California Governor Jerry Brown has declined to impose a moratorium by executive order, angering many environmentalists in the state. The coastal city of Santa Cruz passed a fracking moratorium in September. Last month, the Los Angeles city council voted unanimously to prohibit fracking and other unconventional oil recovery practices at oil fields in the city. A final vote is required before it goes into effect. “California cities and counties have broad legal and moral authority to stop fracking at the local level,” said Zack Malitz of progressive group Credo, which has helped organize scores of rallies against fracking in California. “If Governor Brown doesn’t stand up to the fracking industry, he should expect a wave of local governments, under intense pressure from their constituents, to take action to protect residents from the toxic effects of fracking,” he said.

140,OXY,Occidental Middle East asset sale delayed due to regional disputes - Bloomberg,"March 25 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp is facing delays in its efforts to sell its stake in its Middle East business due to regional disputes over the Muslim Brotherhood, according to Bloomberg. The oil and gas producer had said in October last year that it planned to sell a minority stake in its Middle East and North African operations as a part of a restructuring program to lift its valuation. The oil and gas producer may be forced to split up its assets and sell them to individual countries as a result of political complications, Bloomberg said, quoting Chief Executive Officer Steve Chazen at the Howard Weil Energy Conference in New Orleans on Monday.

141,OXY,UPDATE 1-Ecopetrol declares force majeure on some Vasconia deliveries,"* Affected Vasconia volumes not seen significant * Gov’t negotiating with indigenous community to repair pipe * U.S.’s Occidental suspends contractors until line reopens   (Adds details on attack, obstacles to repairs, background) By Peter Murphy and Luis Jaime Acosta BOGOTA, April 7 (Reuters) - Colombia’s state-run Ecopetrol SA has declared force majeure on a small number of deliveries of medium Vasconia crude after the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline was damaged by a series of attacks by leftist guerillas, a press official said on Monday. The official could not specify on what date force majeure was declared, what quantities were involved or which clients would be affected, but said volumes were not significant enough to require notifying the country’s stock market regulator. The pipeline has been shut since a blast on March 25 in Toledo province, he said. Normally speedy repairs could not take place this time because of objections and demands made by an indigenous community near the site of the blast. Government and justice officials have intervened to seek a solution to the demands, which include diverting the pipeline away from their area, the Ecopetrol press official said. A separate bomb attack took place elsewhere in the same province on April 1, he said. Until repairs can begin, there is no estimate for when the 780 km (485 mile) pipeline, owned by Ecopetrol subsidiary Cenit, could reopen. It has capacity to transport 220,000 barrels per day. U.S.-based Occidental, which like Ecopetrol relies on the pipeline to pump oil to the Caribbean coast from the Cano Limon oil field, said in a statement on Monday that it had to suspend some contractors due to the pipeline’s closure. A Colombia-based source at Occidental said the company had exhausted its storage capacity at the field, forcing it to suspend production. Workers would be able to return once the pipeline was operational, the source said. Occidental produced an average 29,000 barrels per day in 2013, according to data on its web site. Occidental is the operator of the Cano Limon field, where it  produces its own crude and also extracts the share belonging to partner Ecopetrol, meaning both have been immediately affected by the pipeline’s closure. Bomb attacks on Colombia’s pipelines increased in 2013 to 259, the highest in a decade and a 72 percent jump from 2012, according to Defense Ministry data. Leftist rebels say wealth generated in the sector benefits the foreign oil companies producing crude and not the local population. Oil is Colombia’s most valuable export with around 1 million barrels per day produced in 2013, but finding new reserves to boost the 2.38 billion barrels available has become more urgent as production speeds up.

The U.S. company, like rivals Hess Corp and Anadarko Petroleum Corp, is selling overseas assets and investing in the most-profitable shale fields in North America. Occidental’s output dipped 2 percent to 745,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter ended March 31. The company said reduced gas-directed drilling in the United States, field and port strikes in Libya and insurgent activity in Yemen weighed on total production. However, higher crude and natural gas prices in the United States helped Occidental make up for lower production. The company is also scaling back drilling for natural gas and focusing on drilling for the more lucrative crude oil. Occidental’s realized price for U.S. crude rose 5 percent to $95.94 in the January-March quarter, while domestic gas prices jumped 15 percent. U.S. natural gas prices rose by about 50 percent in the quarter as harsh winter in North America sapped excess supplies at the key delivery point Henry Hub in Louisiana. The rise in natural gas prices helped U.S. oil companies Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips report first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. Occidental’s net profit rose 2.6 percent to $1.39 billion, or $1.75 per share, in the quarter, while revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $6.09 billion. The results were above the average analysts’ estimate of a profit of $1.70 per share and revenue of $5.87 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said in October that it plans to sell a minority stake in its Middle East and North African operations, but is yet to announce a deal for the assets. Occidental is also spinning off its oil and gas assets in California into a publicly traded company and has shifted base from Los Angeles to Houston to be closer to its operations in the Permian Basis in Texas and New Mexico.

144,OXY,Occidental suspends Colombia oil output after rebel attack -sources,"BOGOTA, July 2 (Reuters) - Production at Occidental Petroleum Corp’s oil fields in Colombia’s northern Arauca province has been suspended following a rebel attack that left 13 people injured over the weekend, according to company and military sources. The U.S.-based oil company halted operations at two fields, Cano Limon and Caricare, which together produce around 67,000 barrels per day, and informed the government they will remain shut until security is guaranteed, both sources said. The attack, on a worker rest area at the Cano Limon oil field, was carried out by the leftist National Liberation Army, ELN, the government has said. Such attacks are unusual as rebels usually target pipelines and oil wells, not workers. The two sources asked that they not be identified. The government, which is in preliminary peace talks with the ELN, has offered a reward for each captured rebel. Energy Minister Amylkar Acosta said on Wednesday the government would double the number of troops in the area and provide “all the security required” to tackle rebels in the area. “We have sent an important contingent of troops to guarantee the continuance of operations,” Amylkar said. A religious service was taking place in the rest area when the attack happened on Sunday, the government has said. Colombia is Latin America’s fourth-biggest oil producer with daily output of around 1 million barrels. Bomb attacks on oil infrastructure by the country’s leftist guerrillas are frequent, with around five per week on average in 2013. Occidental is the operator of the Cano Limon field, where it produces its own crude and also extracts the share belonging to its partner, state-run Ecopetrol. In April, the company suspended labor contracts as a result of rebel attacks on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which was closed for two months after being blown up at several points by rebels, forcing the company to halt production at the fields.

The feat came as Occidental Petroleum Corp, which owns 20 percent of Hall’s Westport, Connecticut-based hedge fund Astenbeck Capital Management and trading firm Phibro, reported a strong second quarter on Thursday, citing “improved marketing and trading” activity. Occidental did not say if it was still open to selling its stakes in Astenbeck and Phibro, which it was considering early this year to reduce proprietary trading after a patch of weak returns at Hall’s fund. Hall’s Astenbeck returned the most this year from among nine commodity funds that Maryland’s $44 billion state pension system was invested in, data obtained by Reuters showed. The Astenbeck Commodities Fund III, which Maryland had about $137 million in, rose 19.1 percent through June. Astenbeck Capital said in a letter to its investors last month, also seen by Reuters, that it managed about $3.4 billion in different hedge fund accounts, each reporting similar returns. If Astenbeck maintains its near 20 percent gain through the year end, it will be its best annual performance since 2009, when it rose more than 28 percent. The fund, launched in 2008, posted losses in two of the last three years. Hall, who mostly takes bullish long-term bets on oil but also invests in natural gas, platinum and corn, managed to outperform despite range-bound oil markets. Benchmark Brent crude out of London is down almost 5 percent on the year, at below $106 a barrel, while U.S. crude is a tad higher, at around $98. Astenbeck beat rival commodity funds run by prominent money managers such as Carlyle Group, Gresham Investment, Cargill’s Black River, Schroeder, Jamison Capital and Taylor Woods Capital, the data from Maryland showed.

150,OXY,UPDATE 1-Occidental's board approves spin-off of California unit,"(Adds after-hours trading, share buyback detail) HOUSTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp  said on Thursday its board of directors has approved the spin-off of its California oil and natural gas business to its shareholders. Occidental, which has been moving its headquarters from Los Angeles to Houston, said about 80 percent of the outstanding shares of California Resources Corp will be distributed to its shareholders on Nov. 30. Wall Street analysts said the California unit, which is the largest natural gas producer in the state, could be worth $19 billion to $22 billion. Occidental has increased its focus on production from fields in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. Shareholders will receive 0.4 shares of California Resources for every one share of Occidental held as of Nov. 17. Occidental’s board also authorized the repurchase of an additional 60 million of its shares and said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 72 cents per share. Shares of Occidental rose about 1 percent to $96.25 after the close of regular trading.

152,OXY,Oxy sale of Bakken assets would make strategic sense -analysts,"Oct 7 (Reuters) - Any sale of Occidental Petroleum Corp’s  roughly 330,000 acres in North Dakota’s oil-rich Bakken shale formation would make strategic sense for the company, which is likely eager to strike a deal, two analysts said on Tuesday. Oxy is looking to sell its Bakken holdings, which are largely undeveloped, for as much as $3 billion, according to a report from Bloomberg News. Even with the recent dip in crude oil prices, the divestment “makes sense to us, strategically,” Raymond James analysts Pavel Molchanov and Kevin Smith said in a note to clients on Tuesday. “This is substantially undeveloped acreage, and Occidental has long cited it as a likely monetization candidate, so it’s been puzzling why the company kept it this long,” the analysts said. Oxy is spending about $510 million this year on its North Dakota holdings, and any buyer would have to invest significant capital to boost production. Currently, Oxy is the 18th-largest oil producer in North Dakota with about 17,000 barrels per day as of July, trailing peers of the same size and even much-smaller rivals. Oxy said last October that it would pursue “strategic alternatives” for some of its North American assets, including those in North Dakota. In a statement to Reuters on Tuesday, the company reiterated that position. Oxy shares fell 2.3 percent on Tuesday to close at $94.87.   (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder.

153,OXY,Investors wary as energy sector grows in high-yield bonds,"NEW YORK, Oct 7 (IFR) - Energy companies have become a larger presence in the US high-yield bond market this year, relying on debt to fund capex as they expand exploration and production activity, but months of heavy issuance and weaker oil prices are taking their toll. Some recent bond deals have struggled to get across the line, only to end up still getting punished in secondary. Apollo’s US$1.1bn LBO bond for Jupiter Resources, for example, has traded as low as 89 - even after coming to market last month with a five-point discount. “A lot of high-yield energy companies, particularly those developing shale plays, are spending more money than they are taking in,” Patrick Faul, head of research at Calvert Investments, told IFR. “They have to borrow capital to fund their planned development of the fields,” said Faul, adding that most do not have the ability to use internally generated cash flow. In the race to develop shale fields, the industry overall has increased E&P; spending in 2014 around 6%-8% year-on-year, according to Western Asset Management Co - and much of that is funded with high-yield paper. WAMCO said energy borrowers have already accounted for 19% of high-yield debt printed this year, well up from 13.8% for the whole of 2013. In September alone, energy and power made up 25.75% of total issuance, SDC data shows. “We’ve seen so much supply from E&P; companies,” said one high-yield investor. “(It) is sending a bit of a red flag.” Yet it’s more than just the sheer volume of deals that is rattling nerves on the buy-side. Stalling demand from China has fuelled a steep drop in commodity prices. The WTI crude future for November has dropped to 89.40 from the 100.07 on July 25. The investor said he is skeptical about the E&P; sector’s business model overall, raising concerns that access to debt capital markets might get tougher for some borrowers. “They know they will have to come back to the debt markets to finance capex plans, but there is a risk that when energy prices fall, they cannot access the market,” he said. Perhaps the most glaring example of that is Energy Future Holdings, the former TXU, which was taken private in 2007 in what was then the biggest leveraged buyout ever. The company’s fortunes reversed suddenly when natural gas prices plummeted. It filed for bankruptcy this year, and investors figure to recover little from the restructuring. Bankers say the buy-side is also now paying more attention to the capital structure of deals, as well as details about ownership and areas targeted by the E&P; activity they fund. Apollo’s Jupiter bond, for example, was pulled out of the market in August after being met with investor push-back over what were seen as overly aggressive terms. When the trade was resurrected the following month, its covenants were changed, and it was downsized - meaning Apollo had to pump in more equity. It also came with a juicier 9.25% coupon, almost 200bp wider than 7.50% area whispers. “The restrictive covenants in the preliminary terms for the bonds (allowed for) significant debt that can be secured ahead of these bonds,” said Anthony Canale, head of high-yield research at Covenant Review. Another market source said investors were “particularly concerned” about that issuer’s flexibility to add more debt. He referenced the poor performance of unsecured bonds issued by sector rival Samson Resources, owned by KKR, when it piled on more debt. Energy bonds were the second-worst performing high-yield sector in September, down about 2.24%, according to Citi. Naturally, that has had an impact on new issues. California Resources, which came to market the same week in September as Jupiter, priced its US$5bn trade three-tranche bond at the wide end of talk as investors demanded a premium for the big size of the deal and the area it operates in. The bond financed the spin-off of the business from Occidental Petroleum Corp. “It’s not the Permian basin and, because of the spin-off, its area is limited to California. As a result it needed to pay more,” said the market source. But the trade wasn’t a disaster. It may have cost the company a bit more, but it still attracted an US$8bn order book. Bankers are now looking ahead to a similarly sized issue for Single B rated Dynegy, tipped to come to market in the next few weeks to partly finance its acquisition of coal and plants from Duke Energy and Energy Capital Partners (ECP). CreditSights is positive on the new Dynegy issue, despite investor worries it will re-price the company’s outstanding curve and broader concerns about softer prices. “The biggest risk to Dynegy remains weak natural gas prices and a potential drop into the low US$3s,” CreditSights said, “but this (M&A;) deal gives the company more fuel source diversity.”   (Reporting by Mariana Santibanez; Editing by Natalie Harrison and Marc Carnegie)",10072014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hy-bonds-energy/investors-wary-as-energy-sector-grows-in-high-yield-bonds-idUSL1N0RK16420141007

160,OXY,U.S. court refuses to hold Occidental liable in Colombia bombing,"(Reuters) - A divided federal appeals court on Wednesday refused to hold Occidental Petroleum Corp and a security contractor legally responsible for alleged complicity in a 1998 military bombing of a Colombian village that killed 17 people, including six children. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California said victims’ families could not pursue claims against Occidental and Florida-based AirScan Inc under two U.S. human rights laws, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) and Torture Victims Protection Act. Writing for a 2-1 majority, Circuit Judge Jay Bybee cited a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum Co, in finding that the ATS did not apply because the underlying conduct occurred “exclusively” in Colombia. He also said the torture victim law does not apply to corporate defendants. In addition, Bybee said “international comity” justified dismissal, citing a 2004 State Department memo that said letting Colombian courts handle the matter advanced U.S. foreign policy. “The crimes plaintiffs allege are abominable, but the facts of this case nonetheless favor applying adjudicatory comity,” Bybee wrote. Circuit Judge Sandra Ikuta joined Bybee’s 65-page decision, which upheld a 2010 lower court ruling. Both judges were appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush. Terry Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients are “very disappointed” and plan to ask a larger appeals court panel to revisit the case. He said the 9th Circuit viewed Kiobel differently in an earlier case concerning Nestle SA. Occidental did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit arose from a Dec. 13, 1998 cluster bomb attack by Colombia’s air force on Santo Domingo, a village near an Occidental oil pipeline that was a target of leftist rebels. Occidental and AirScan were accused of having provided the military with financial and logistical support. Both denied wrongdoing, and Houston-based Occidental has said it did not provide lethal aid. U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly, who normally works in Seattle, dissented from Wednesday’s decision, and would have let the plaintiffs replead their ATS claims. He said the majority “needlessly announces novel standards that will thwart the ability of not only these plaintiffs, but also of every other alien who seeks to hold a U.S. corporation accountable for atrocities committed abroad.”  Zilly was appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan.

164,OXY,U.S. court dismisses Colombian human rights claims against Occidental,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal appeals court on Monday threw out a human rights lawsuit brought against Occidental Petroleum Corp over allegations that it played a role in killings carried out by the  Colombian military in 2004. A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district court judge’s decision to dismiss the lawsuit filed in California by family members of three labor union leaders killed by the 18th Brigade of the Colombian National Army during the incident.  The plaintiffs claimed that Houston-based Occidental, which operates a pipeline near the Venezuelan border, provided funding to the brigade, making it liable for the actions of the soldiers under a U.S. federal law called the Alien Tort Statute as well as California state law. Terrence Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he was “very disappointed” with the decision and would consider an appeal. Occidental’s Colombian subsidiary and Ecopetrol, Colombia’s state-owned oil company, jointly gave assistance worth $6.3 million to help with security at a time when guerrillas were attacking the pipeline, according to the ruling. Colombian government officials said at the time the people killed were guerrilla members who had attacked soldiers. The family members who sued for monetary damages said the union members were killed in part because they had been critical of the environmental impact of the oil industry. In an unsigned opinion, the appeals court said U.S. courts could not hear the case because it was an inherently political question. The court noted that the U.S. government had itself provided $99 million worth of training and equipment to the 18th Brigade. In November, the same appeals court ruled for Occidental in a similar case, also concerning the company’s activities in Colombia. The ruling is the latest in a series of victories for corporations seeking to fend off human rights lawsuits following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in April 2013 in favor of Royal Dutch Shell. In that case, the justices limited the circumstances under which companies can be sued for human rights violations under the Alien Tort Statute. The case decided on Monday is Saldana v.

166,OXY,Occidental CEO jokes Chevron is an unsuitable buyer; lifts stock,"WILLISTON, N.D. (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) Chief Executive Stephen Chazen quipped on Thursday that his larger rival Chevron Corp (CVX.N) was too poor to buy the No. 4 U.S oil producer, but the offhand remark sent Oxy’s stock up anyway. During a conference call to discuss the company’s fourth-quarter results, an analyst asked Chazen if his company was on the market. The question was to be expected. With oil prices down by half since June and profits slipping, bankers are readying for a wave of mergers and acquisitions that can be made on the cheap. “Have you considered selling Oxy?” Wolfe Research’s Paul Sankey said. Chazen, an Oxy employee since 1994 and CEO since 2011, responded, “Right now, people are cash flow challenged so I suspect selling Oxy is probably not likely.” Then, without Sankey or any other analyst mentioning Chevron, Chazen casually mentioned he had reviewed the second-largest U.S. oil producer’s books. “I looked at Chevron and they don’t have any free cash,” Chazen said on the call.  Laughter was audible in the background, but eyebrows were raised by the mention of a specific company, which is three times Oxy’s size with $14.3 billion cash in the bank and could probably buy Oxy if it wanted. After Chazen’s comments, shares of Occidental, which had been falling, reversed course. They finished up 2.4 percent at $78.31 per share on a day when most energy stocks were flat.     “Mr. Chazen’s comments were made in jest,” Oxy spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb said when asked for comment after the call.     A tie-up, however unlikely, might be difficult since the companies have not had especially warm relations.  Both have California roots; Oxy only recently moved its headquarters to Houston. But as recently as last year, there were legal wranglings between Chevron and the U.S. government over oil-rich acreage in California that the government sold to Occidental. The saga strained relations between the two companies, especially because the land is considered one of California’s largest oilfields with about 1 billion barrels of reserves. Chazen, who also said on the call that Oxy was not interested in making acquisitions, declined through a spokesperson to be interviewed. Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, declined to comment. The company is due to report quarterly financial results on Friday. “We’re not going to comment on rumor or speculation on M&A;,” Chevron spokesman Kurt Glaubitz said.

A tie-up, however unlikely, might be difficult since the companies have not had especially warm relations. Both have California roots; Oxy only recently moved its headquarters to Houston. But as recently as last year, there were legal wranglings between Chevron and the U.S. government over oil-rich acreage in California that the government sold to Occidental. The saga strained relations between the two companies, especially because the land is considered one of California’s largest oilfields with about 1 billion barrels of reserves. Chazen, who also said on the call that Oxy was not interested in making acquisitions, declined through a spokesperson to be interviewed. Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, declined to comment. The company is due to report quarterly financial results on Friday. “We’re not going to comment on rumor or speculation on M&A;,” Chevron spokesman Kurt Glaubitz said.

169,OXY,"Conoco, Occidental and Shell cut 2015 budgets on crude slide","HOUSTON/WILLISTON, N.D. (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) on Thursday slashed exploration spending plans for this year, as the third- and fourth-largest U.S. oil companies attempt to cope with a steep slide in crude prices. The cuts follow similar steps by rival Hess Corp (HES.N) earlier this week while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Europe’s largest oil company, said on Thursday it would reduce its spending the next three years by $15 billion.   Rising supplies of oil, from sources including North American shale basins, and weakening demand have flooded global markets with crude, sending prices plummeting almost 60 percent since June. On Thursday, crude traded in New York at $43.80 per barrel, much lower than many oil and gas projects require to make money. In response to the price collapse, oil and gas companies have made drastic cuts to budgets, idled drilling rigs and in some cases, cut jobs. For a factbox on capex cuts, click on: Conoco, which said in December it would cut 2015 spending by 20 percent to $13.5 billion, now expects spending to be scaled back by a further 15 percent to $11.5 billion. Occidental said it would slash its capital budget by 33 percent to $5.8 billion this year. “There’s a lot of debate right now about the duration of the current low oil prices. But we’re assuming that they will stay low for 2015 and we’re taking decisive actions accordingly,” Ryan Lance, Conoco’s CEO, said on a conference call.  Conoco’s second trimming of its 2015 capex budget raised the specter that others in the industry could further reduce their own spending, potentially reinforcing a dip in U.S. production that the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts to occur this summer.  That would mark a sharp turnabout for the U.S. oil industry, which has enjoyed five years of blistering output growth thanks to the shale oil boom.  Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil producer, has yet to unveil 2015 spending and may do so on Friday when it reports quarterly results.   Conoco said it would defer drilling some U.S. onshore exploration programs and delay spending on some major projects. Occidental said it will pull back spending in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale and in Bahrain. “We think it is imprudent to accelerate some of these opportunities in the current low product price environment,” Occidental Chief Executive Stephen Chazen told investors. Analysts at Houston-based investment bank Simmons & Co said Conoco’s plan to further reduce capital spending is the right move to make, in this “challenging environment.” Neither Conoco nor Occidental are running out of cash, despite the low prices, though. Indeed, Occidental last quarter spent $1.3 billion on 100,000 acres in the Permian, a prolific shale formation in Texas. Chazen said the deal was to better connect existing acreage and boost drilling efficiencies.  Both companies also expect oil and gas output to rise this year, although possibly at a slower rate. Conoco now expects oil and gas output to grow 2 percent to 3 percent. That compares with a previous forecast for growth of 3 percent. Occidental said its production will ramp up 6 percent to 10 percent, helped by wells in the Permian Basin. Excluding one-time items, both companies reported earnings that topped analyst expectations. Conoco was helped by better-than-expected results in its Asia Pacific and Middle East segment, while Occidental’s adjusted earnings were lifted by its chemicals business. On a net basis, both companies reported a quarterly loss. Conoco had a fourth-quarter loss of $39 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with a profit of $2.5 billion, or $2.00 a per share. One time-items including the termination of the Freeport LNG agreement.  Occidental reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $3.41 billion, or $4.41 per share.

The oil producer agreed to fund development programs for the five Achuar communities in Peru’s Amazon, which first filed a lawsuit in 2007, said Marco Simons, who represented them in court for the not-for-profit group EarthRights International. A joint statement between the two parties was read by Simons at a news briefing in Lima. Occidental had no further comment other than what was in the statement. A confidentiality clause prohibits the parties from revealing the size of the negotiated settlement, but both sides said they were pleased. Occidental has denied charges its operations in Peru polluted the environment. “We’ve reached our objective of teaching the company a lesson,” said Achuar villager Adolfina Garcia at a news conference in Lima, the Peruvian capital. The communities had alleged Occidental spilled oil and dumped toxic waste while operating Peru’s biggest oil block, triggering widespread health problems. Garcia said she believes her 11-year-old son died because he drank water from a river polluted by Occidental. The plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in a federal court in Los Angeles, California, where Occidental used to be based, arguing Peruvian courts would shield Occidental. Occidental lost its bid to have the lawsuit dismissed from U.S. courts in 2010. The settlement agreement was reached in September of 2013 but the terms barred an announcement until now, Simons said. Occidental operated Peru’s oil block 1-AB from 1971 to 2000 before selling its operations to Argentine firm Pluspetrol.

In the last week of January, rigs fell by 94, the biggest drop on record, according to a weekly survey by oil service firm Baker Hughes. [RIG/U] U.S. companies remain nervous about oil prices. Spending has been cut as prices fail to rebound significantly, and further price drops could quickly lead to more shrinkage in the rig count.  But the decline has slowed, dropping by just 23 rigs in the last two weeks, the smallest weekly cuts since December, according to the latest survey released on Thursday, a sign that the rig count could be approaching its low point. Some reckon that a 50-60 percent drop is as far as it will fall, once energy firms remove their least efficient rigs. “Production companies are in a holding pattern for now,” said Eric Lee, analyst at Citi in New York. “It could be the beginning of the flattening of the decline in the rig count.” The U.S. rig count is vital for global oil markets that have been flooded with oversupply this year, but it has proven a conundrum for traders and analysts.  U.S. oil output remains strong and continues to contribute to the global glut, despite the drop in rigs, in part because it takes time for a decline in drilling to hit production levels, but also because rigs are more efficient now than even a year ago. U.S. drillers were forced to scale back after oil prices fell 60 percent to near $40 a barrel in January, from more than  $100 a barrel last June. The rig count fell by 11 to 802 this week, according to the latest Baker Hughes survey, the lowest number since 2011.     “We think 1,000-1,200 rigs will keep production steady. With 800 rigs, we should see production decline in the second half of the year,” said Francisco Blanch, analyst at Bank of America. “We might see a little more rigs lost, but the majority of the fall is behind us.”  According to Baker Hughes, oil rigs in the Permian Basin of Texas, one of the country’s largest oil deposits, fell this week to 280, the lowest level since basin-by-basin records began in early 2011 and down from over 560 in November. In the Williston Basin of North Dakota, oil rigs are at 91, also the lowest since 2011, down from nearly 200 in November.  In both regions, however, the decline has eased.  The decline scenario was unthinkable six months ago when oil was at $90 a barrel and the oil production boom showed little sign of abating, despite a drop from $107 in June.  It remains to be seen how production will be impacted or whether a lower rig count will help reduce the growing U.S. crude stockpile that is causing jitters in the market.    “We have seen an awful lot of damage and the consequences for production will be manifested in months rather than quarters,” said William Herbert, managing director at Simmons & Company International investment bank in Houston.  Herbert expects the rig count to fall by about another 100 rigs before bottoming out at the end of June.

183,OXY,UAE's ADNOC says no timeframe for decision on onshore concession,"ABU DHABI, April 20 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) does not have a deadline for when to award further stakes in its 40-year onshore oilfield concession, the director general of the state run company said on Monday. The comment suggests ADNOC, which signed an agreement on Jan. 29 with France’s Total giving the firm a 10 percent stake in the new concession, is in no rush to make a decision about other bidders in the tender. Total’s bid set the bar high for peers like BP and Royal Dutch Shell after the French oil major submitted the best bid and highest signature bonus, according to industry sources. When asked if talks with Shell and BP continued after they submitted revised bids, ADNOC’s director general Abdullah Nasser al-Suwaidi told reporters in Abu Dhabi that the oil companies “know what we’ve asked for and they bid.” “Whoever meets our conditions, will be considered... there is no timeline,” he added. A total of nine firms bid for stakes in the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) concession which became available after a 40-year deal with Western oil companies expired in January 2014. ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and BP each held 9.5 percent equity stakes in that ADCO concession. After the deal expired last year, ADNOC took 100 percent of the concession as political leaders in Abu Dhabi weighed up whether to bring in Asian firms, industry and diplomatic sources said. Shell, Total and BP made new bids, while Exxon decided against bidding. Other bidders include U.S. firm Occidental Petroleum Corp , Italy’s ENI, China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), Norway’s Statoil, Korea National Oil Corp. and Japan’s Inpex.

184,OXY,UPDATE 3-Japan's Inpex wins 5 pct stake in new Abu Dhabi oil concession,"(Recasts lead, adds detail, background) By Yuka Obayashi and Rania El Gamal TOKYO/ABU DHABI, April 27 (Reuters) - Japan’s Inpex Corp  became the first Asian oil company to get a stake in a new 40-year onshore oil concession in Abu Dhabi, joining France’s Total in developing the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) biggest oilfields. Nine Asian and Western companies bid for stakes in the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) concession after a deal with the Western majors dating back to the 1970s expired in January 2014. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) said on Monday it had granted Inpex a 5 percent stake in the new concession. The fields produce 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) and output is expected to rise to 1.8 million from 2017. Total became the first oil major to renew the concession, putting peers under pressure to improve terms after the local partner said the French firm made the best offer. Last week, ADNOC’s director general said there was no deadline for awarding further stakes in the concession, suggesting Abu Dhabi was in no rush to make a decision about other bidders in the tender. The Inpex concession gives Japan, which imports almost all of its oil and is the fourth-biggest importer, the ability to procure oil without passing through the chokepoint of the Strait of Hormuz at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yoichi Miyazawa told reporters. “This is an epoch-making event and this pact will contribute greatly to Japan’s stable procurement of oil,” Miyazawa said. It is the first major stake in an oil concession Japan has obtained since 2009. Japan holds stakes in oilfields producing 610,000 bpd and the ADCO concession will boost the figure by 15 percent when production is expanded to 1.8 million bpd. Inpex did not disclose the value of the deal due to a confidentiality agreement, but Japanese public broadcaster NHK said earlier it was expected to be worth $1.1 billion. Other bidders for the concessions include Occidental Petroleum Corp, Italy’s ENI, China National Petroleum Corp, Norway’s Statoil and Korea National Oil Corp. The concession signed with Total was effective from Jan. 1, 2015, and covers Abu Dhabi’s 15 principal onshore oilfields that represent more than half of the Gulf emirate’s production. Four oil majors — ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell , Total and BP — had each held 9.5 percent equity stakes in the ADCO concession since the 1970s. After the deal expired last year, state-run ADNOC took 100 percent of the concession as political leaders in Abu Dhabi weighed up whether to bring in Asian firms or stick with old partners, industry and diplomatic sources said. Shell and BP have also put in new bids, while Exxon has decided against bidding, sources have told Reuters. For Japan, which imported 3.45 million bpd of oil in 2014, the UAE accounted for about 24 percent of the supply. Inpex also owns a stake in the ADNOC’s offshore oil concession, which is set to expire in 2018. Japan’s next challenge is to win a renewal of that stake. “The deal on the onshore oil fields underlines a sense of trust in Japan by Abu Dhabi and could add momentum to our negotiation for the offshore concession,” Ryo Minami, director at the oil and gas division at Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, told reporters. Japan, which aims to boost self-sufficiency in gas and oil to 40 percent by the 2030 fiscal year, will raise the ratio to near 25 percent with the latest deal from 23.3 percent in the 2013/14 year.

190,OXY,Occidental Petroleum boosts 2015 production outlook,"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) boosted its 2015 production forecast on Wednesday after reporting an adjusted quarterly profit in line with expectations as cost cuts helped balance  the recent drop in oil prices. Occidental raised its 2015 output forecast by 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), citing “a more optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year.” Chief Executive Officer Steve Chazen said he is comfortable the company can be cash-flow neutral by the fourth quarter if the West Texas Intermediate oil price CLc1 stays at least at $60 per barrel. The raised production outlook comes as the oil industry gets more comfortable that the increase in prices during April may be sustainable.  Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N) and Concho Resources Inc (CXO.N) also raised their production outlooks this week.     Occidental posted a net loss of $218 million, or 28 cents per share, compared with net income of $1.39 billion, or $1.75 per share, in the year-ago period. Factoring in one-time items, the company earned 4 cents per share, matching analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.         Production rose 13 percent to 645,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the quarter, largely due to higher output from its Permian shale operations in Texas. Chemical unit earnings rose 2 percent from a year ago to $139 million. The midstream pipeline business posted a loss of $5 million, compared with a profit of $96 million in the year-ago quarter, due to falling ethane and propane costs.

193,OXY,Brent posts weekly loss after month of gains; U.S. crude up,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent oil posted its first weekly loss in a month on Friday as the market fretted again about global oversupply while U.S. crude rose for an eighth straight week, helped by jobs growth data and the first storm of the hurricane season forming. Crude prices had rallied with little pause over the past month, helped by a weaker dollar and bets that better demand in the near term will ease the supply glut. But on Thursday, prices fell as much as 3 percent, their most since early April, after hitting 2015 highs. Oil was also pressured by a stronger dollar and physical oil markets showing tens millions of West African, Azeri and North Sea crude barrels without buyers. In Friday’s session, Brent, the more globally-used benchmark for oil, settled down 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $65.39 a barrel. It was down 1.6 percent on the week. Brent had risen previously in four consecutive weeks, gaining nearly 20 percent. U.S. crude rose 45 cents, or 0.8 percent, for the session to settle at $59.39 a barrel. It climbed 0.4 percent on the week, extending gains for an eighth straight week that had put the market up 32 percent. Some analysts doubted the market could press on without correction. “We can see some downside acceleration next week and we are leaving a $40 price handle on the table,” said Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois. Brent slipped after early support from record high crude imports in China in April. Traders cautioned that low prices could encourage China to stockpile, adding to global inventories. Trading also turned choppy on the realization that last week’s drawdown in U.S. inventories was at the expense of builds in gasoline and distillates. [EIA/S] “Products inventories were up, so it looks like the crude is just being turned into products” without corresponding demand, said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York. Still, U.S. crude sidestepped those concerns to rise on higher nonfarm payrolls in April. Also supportive to the market was news that Ana, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season which traditionally begins June 1, had formed off the coast of South Carolina.. U.S. crude also stayed resilient despite this week’s drop in the country’s oil rig count, a measure for future output, being the smallest in a month.

194,OXY,Goldman cuts crude outlook and oil company forecasts,"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has cut its long-term crude oil price forecasts and recommended investors sell shares in two major oil companies, saying that improved U.S. shale efficiency and higher production from OPEC will more than cover future demand. The U.S. investment bank’s equities team, in a note published on Saturday, raised its projection for the average Brent crude oil LCOc1 price this year to $58 a barrel from $52 and lifted its outlook for U.S. light crude futures CLc1 to $52 a barrel from $48. But Goldman, closely followed investors including large pensions and hedge funds, said it expects Brent to fall over time, reaching $55 a barrel by 2020. Brent traded around $67 a barrel at 1100 GMT on Monday. “We lower our Brent oil price assumption to $60-$65 for 2016-2019, falling to $55 for 2020,” Goldman said. “We see global oil demand being met by U.S. shale, which is continuing to benefit from efficiency and productivity improvements, and OPEC,” the bank’s note to clients added. Goldman said that this “lower-for-longer oil price” would “put significant pressure” on integrated oil companies, forcing a rethink on dividends. “As a result, we downgrade the sector outlook to ‘cautious’ from ‘neutral’,” it said. The bank downgraded BP (BP.L) and Statoil (STL.OL) to “sell” from “neutral”, citing long-term dividend risk for BP and cashflow pressure on Statoil. Last week the U.S. investment bank described a recent rally in oil prices was “premature”, adding that a weakening of prices is required for a rebalancing of the market to resume. Oil prices have recovered this year after sharp falls through the second half of 2014. Goldman Sachs said it assumed a $5 a barrel spread between Brent and U.S. crude, which is also known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), through 2016-2020.

After pouring tens of billions of dollars into foreign energy projects in the last two decades, China’s rush to purchase overseas oil and gas projects is over - at least for now - and some state firms are even looking to sell assets. China, the world’s second-biggest oil consumer, invested more than $140 billion in the sector in the period from 1993, according to Thomson Reuters data. But Chinese firms have slammed the brakes on after a slide in crude prices has slashed returns on some investments and with deals coming under greater scrutiny since Beijing stepped up an anti-graft campaign two years ago. The shift started last year but has become more pronounced in recent months, industry sources say, with the focus for management now on more mundane goals such as cutting costs and improving returns from assets rather than new purchases. “The era of rapid, sometimes blind, expansions is over,” said Luo Zuoxian, an economist at a research arm of Sinopec Group, parent of Sinopec Corp, China’s No.2 energy giant. Luo does not foresee any big acquisitions in the next three to five years. Sinopec, which in late 2013 surprised the market by putting up for sale some shale gas assets in Canada, may now look to offload more “non-core” assets, senior company sources said. Sinopec Group is also shaking up its global exploration unit and re-assessing its broader investment strategy to identify “core areas” for spending in future. This could mean that projects in places such as eastern Africa, which is rich in natural gas, could fall outside the targets, because to exploit them would require heavy spending and years to get returns, one of the sources said. Sinopec declined to comment on divestment plans. ANTI-GRAFT DRIVE Beijing’s anti-graft drive, which has felled about a dozen top oil executives, has also made it harder to strike new deals. New chairmen have been appointed in May at the top three energy groups - China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) , parent of PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC, parent of CNOOC Ltd. “The anti-graft climate sends a message: ‘to do less is safer’”, said an investment official at a state oil firm. China’s graft watchdog said in April that some of Sinopec’s overseas investments had generated low returns or even no revenue after years of output. “It’s definitely a dialing back of what they want to achieve. Previously it was growth at all cost, now the mantra is return on value,” said Neil Beveridge of Bernstein Research. In a bid to cut spending, CNPC said last week it has started renegotiation with contractors on 24 overseas projects including gas ventures in Russia and Mozambique. Thomson Reuters data showed outbound oil and gas deals were $4.4 billion last year, the lowest since 2008. China has had highs and lows in investments going back. A decade ago, CNOOC pulled an $18.5 billion bid for U.S firm Unocal after intense opposition from Washington, though in 2013 it bought Canada’s Nexen Inc for $15.1 billion, China’s largest foreign acquisition. Asked about its strategy in a low oil price environment, CNOOC said it would prudently invest, balancing short-term return and long-term development and focusing on cash flow, as well as optimising assets and capital allocation. CNOOC sold several small conventional gas assets last year, and Sinochem Group pulled back its team of five from the Wolfcamp shale operation in Texas, company sources said. Sinopec’s Argentine oil and gas venture, bought in 2010 from Occidental Petroleum Corp, could be considered for divestment, said a company source. But as China remains a top oil buyer, with imports of crude on two occasions exceeding that of the United States this year, some say it is only a matter of time before Chinese firms buy abroad again, albeit more cautiously. “Once the new management has settled down, the low interest rate environment in China together with stabilizing oil prices should improve the cash flow, enabling them to exploit opportunistic acquisitions overseas, perhaps starting 2017,” said Gordon Kwan of Nomura research.

199,OXY,Oxy to exit North Dakota's oil fields in sale to private equity fund,"DICKINSON, N.D./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp, the fourth-largest U.S. oil producer, has agreed to sell all of its North Dakota shale oil acreage and assets to private equity fund Lime Rock Resources in a deal worth around $500 million, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The sale, which marks the first exit of this downturn by a major oil company from the Bakken shale formation, encompasses all of Oxy’s more than 300,000 acres in the state, including a 21,000 square-foot regional office built just three years ago. Lime Rock, which already operates in North Dakota, is buying the assets as the oil industry contends with the worst crude price crash in more than six years, a drop the fund used to its advantage. As recently as last fall, Wall Street had expected Oxy’s Bakken assets to sell for more than $3 billion. The sharp drop in the deal’s value represents the most-significant pullback in valuation yet in the second-largest U.S. oil producing state. Lime Rock is requiring all of Oxy’s North Dakota employees to re-apply for their jobs, according to one of the sources. Lime Rock and Oxy, both of which are based in Houston, declined to comment.

201,OXY,Occidental's North Dakota deal mixed omen for pending oilfield deals,"WILLISTON, N.D., Oct 16 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp’s move to sell its North Dakota acreage likely removes a logjam that had impeded U.S. oilfield deals for much of the year, though the deal’s price sets an unusually low bar for future deals and gives buyers the advantage over sellers. Oxy is selling all of its roughly 300,000 acres in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation to a private equity fund in a deal valued around $500 million, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The price is roughly one-sixth, though, of what Wall Street had expected Oxy to fetch for the assets as recently as last year. Houston-based Oxy did not sell the North Dakota assets out of distress; indeed, it has $2.8 billion in cash in the bank. Rather, the deal removes an operational distraction from managers focused elsewhere and helps the company achieve its goal of being cash-flow neutral. Still, for ConocoPhillips, Whiting Petroleum Corp , Oasis Petroleum Inc and other oil companies pursuing pipeline or oil acreage sales, Oxy has set the bar low. “The (Oxy) sale price shows the stark reality that operators trying to sell non-core acreage face in a sub-$50 per barrel oil world face,” said Tim Rezvan, an oil industry analyst at Sterne Agee CRT. Conoco, one of the largest American oil producers, is trying to sell oil and gas properties in the Rockies, East Texas, South Texas and Northern Louisiana, with expectations for the total value of all the deals eclipsing $2 billion. As with Oxy, the deals would not be crucial to Conoco’s survival, but would give the company cash to weather the low oil price storm and focus more on core operations. Yet with Oxy accepting far lower than Wall Street expected for its non-core acreage in North Dakota, it remains to be seen if Conoco can hit that target. Whiting and Oasis are currently selling so-called midstream assets mostly comprised of pipelines and saltwater disposal units. But the assets, which generate steady streams of cash, might now go for far less than executives want, which would be potentially harmful for these companies. In the case of Oasis, which operates only in North Dakota, the sale of all or part of its saltwater disposal business is seen as vital to keeping core oil operations online. Earlier this month Wall Street banks cut Oasis’ credit line by roughly $170 million, the largest reported reduction this autumn of an oil producer’s access to debt markets in the wake of plunging crude prices. That cut stressed the company’s balance sheet and put further onus on a good price for the saltwater disposal assets, which at one time was estimated to be worth as much as $880 million.

The World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in 2012 ordered Ecuador to pay the damages to Occidental, an award that the OPEC member has demanded be annulled. Correa said he expects a decision on the request on Monday. “We’re ready, we’ve been talking with the company to try to resolve things in a friendly way, things are going well,” the leftist Ecuadorean leader said, without providing further details. “We have a lot of faith that the tribunal has taken up our petition for annulment, but if that’s not the case, we’re ready for any scenario,” Correa added. The Ecuadorean government decided to terminate Occidental Petroleum’s contract in May 2006, arguing the company had sold a stake in its operations without government consent. At the time, Occidental was Ecuador’s largest oil investor, extracting around 100,000 barrels of oil per day Occidental Petroleum, also known as Oxy, filed a request for arbitration in July 2006.

226,OXY,Ecuador negotiates at least 18 pct cut to Occidental award - Correa,"QUITO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The government of Ecuador obtained a discount of at least 18 percent on compensation required by a World Bank tribunal for seizing Occidental Petroleum Corp’s  assets, President Rafael Correa said, adding that negotiations were ongoing. In 2012, the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) awarded Occidental $1.77 billion. An ICSID tribunal then cut the award by 40 percent in November and the negotiations appear to have reduced that amount by a further 18 percent. “We are negotiating very hard and have obtained a discount of at least 18 percent of the payment. This may increase,” Correa said in the coastal province of Guayas. “But in truth we are going to pay 30 percent less,” he added, explaining that the percentage includes some tax disputes and labor liabilities that Occidental has pending in the country. The discounts would come in addition to the 40 percent reduction announced earlier this year. Ecuador is requesting a “comprehensive agreement” to finalize all outstanding issues between the two parties. “The oil company wants to impose a clause that leaves the door open to continue suing the country and that is unacceptable,” said Correa. Reuters was not immediately able to obtain comment from Occidental. Ecuador seized the field known as Block 15 from Occidental in 2006, arguing that its sale to Andes Petroleum had been carried out without government consent. At the time of the contract termination, Occidental was Ecuador’s largest oil investor, extracting around 100,000 barrels of oil per day.

227,OXY,Ecuador to pay $980 million to Occidental for asset seizure,"QUITO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Ecuador has reached a deal to pay Occidental Petroleum Corp roughly $980 million by April to compensate the company for seizing its oil field in the Andean country, the attorney general said on Tuesday evening. Ecuador has negotiated down a 2012 arbitration award from the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes requiring it to pay the U.S.-based company $1.77 billion. While Ecuador remains opposed to the arbitration decision, Attorney General Diego Garcia said the country was obligated to pay Occidental. If it does not pay the arbitration award, Ecuador could be exposed to asset seizures. “We’re conscious that the award is enforceable, and if Ecuador doesn’t honor it, even if we’re right, it could be enforced,” Garcia told television channel Ecuavisa, adding that the country would finish paying by April. The payment is a further hit to the OPEC nation’s finances, which are reeling from the slide in energy prices.

228,OXY,SandRidge Energy explores debt restructuring options-sources,"Jan 25 (Reuters) - SandRidge Energy Inc is exploring debt restructuring options, according to people familiar with the matter, as the heavily indebted U.S. oil and gas exploration and production company struggles with the fallout from plunging energy prices. SandRidge has been in talks with investment banks and law firms about hiring restructuring advisors, and could make an announcement on their appointment as early as this week, the people said. Debtwire had reported on Jan. 13, also citing unnamed sources, that SandRidge - which produces oil and gas from shale formations in the Mid-Continent region of the United States - had hired Houlihan Lokey to craft a restructuring plan. Houlihan Lokey is very likely to be named SandRidge’s financial advisor for any restructuring, the Reuters sources said. These sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. SandRidge and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment. Oklahoma City-based SandRidge, which has a debt burden of around $4 billion, has already been reaching out to some of its creditors to inform them that they should work together to prepare for likely negotiations, one of the sources said. The vast majority of the company’s debt is in the form of bonds owned by a plethora of mutual funds, hedge funds, and other institutional investors. They do not yet have a single representative who could be reached for comment. One of the options that the company will consider is a pre-packaged bankruptcy with the agreement of its creditors, the people said. They said that a decision on a way forward is not imminent and that the company has access to enough cash to continue doing business for at least several more months under its current structure. Other avenues SandRidge could pursue would include a debt exchange or filing for bankruptcy protection without any agreement with its creditors. It is not clear whether the company currently has a preference for a particular route. As oil prices hover around 12-year lows, many U.S. oil and gas exploration and production companies are looking for ways to stay afloat. SandRidge, which made risky bets in the Mississippi Lime formation in northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas, is particularly vulnerable. For months, SandRidge has been caught in a bind, having just enough money to pay interest on its debt, but not enough to drill new wells or replace older ones. Mississippi Lime wells typically do not produce as much oil as some other shale formations, and the rock also contains a lot of water, which is costly to haul away. After an initially encouraging exploration phase, the shale play has not delivered the low cost production gains that SandRidge and Wall Street analysts expected. About 40 energy companies entered bankruptcy in 2015 and more are expected in the next few months as oil prices have dropped by 75 percent since mid-2014. The companies that filed last year include Swift Energy Co, which filed for bankruptcy on December 31, Magnum Hunter Resources Corp and Samson Resources Corp. SandRidge attracted the ire of Oklahoma regulators over its use of wells to dispose of wastewater, an activity that is believed to trigger earthquakes. Last week, the company agreed to shut seven wells in the state and reduce the amount of wastewater injected into roughly 40 others. On Friday, SandRidge said it had also settled a dispute stemming from a 30-year agreement to send Occidental Petroleum Corp a fixed amount of natural gas from the Pinon field in west Texas each year. Occidental had been treating the gas to extract carbon dioxide which it uses in its own oil recovery business and then sending methane back to SandRidge. However,  low natural gas prices have made it uneconomic for SandRidge to fulfill the contract and it faced potential penalties that could have eventually run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Under the agreement, SandRidge will hand over the Pinon assets to Occidental plus $11 million in cash and Occidental will drop any claims from the previous deal. SandRidge said the settlement is expected to reduce its operating costs by $39 million in 2016. To raise cash, SandRidge has put its headquarters in Oklahoma City up for sale in May, but has yet to find a buyer. In April, it laid off at least 130 employees, or 20 percent of its workforce based there, public records show. It has also previously used a distressed debt exchange with creditors to lighten its debt load. SandRidge had $790 million in cash and access to undrawn credit facilities that gave it access to capital totaling $1.9 billion, chief financial officer Julian Bott said on the company’s latest quarterly earnings call on Nov. 5. This has given the company breathing room of several more months to decide on a way forward, as well as scope to pursue another debt exchange. As of earlier this month, SandRidge’s shares are no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and trade on the OTC Pink marketplace instead with a market capitalization of around $30 million. Its bonds are trading at extremely distressed levels, with its Jan. 15 2020 notes at below 5 cents on the dollar. Oklahoma-based SandRidge was founded in 2006 by former CEO Tom Ward, a previous executive and co-founder of natural gas giant Chesapeake Energy Corp. Ward was ousted by SandRidge’s board in 2013 after some of SandRidge’s largest investors alleged governance lapses and strategic missteps, including transactions SandRidge had made with entities controlled by the Ward family. His exit package from the firm was worth around $90 million. A request for comment at Ward’s new Oklahoma City-based company, Tapstone Energy, was not immediately returned. SandRidge named James Bennett as CEO in June of 2013.

230,OXY,Occidental Petroleum says no plans to cut dividend,"HOUSTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp , the fourth-largest U.S. oil producer, says it has no plans to cut its dividend and is confident the outlay can be covered through a combination of cash flow and debt despite low crude prices. Oxy’s dividend costs the company about $2.23 billion annually. Given that cost, the more-than 70 percent drop in crude prices in the past year and a move by fellow independent oil producer ConocoPhillips to slash its own dividend on Thursday, analysts and investors asked Oxy executives for reassurances on a conference call. “We don’t see a threat to our dividend going through this cycle,” Oxy President Vicki Hollub said on the call.

234,OXY,CERAWEEK-Occidental CEO warns of looming issues from midstream debt,"HOUSTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil and gas pipeline and processing companies that borrowed vast amounts to grow when crude oil prices were much higher and U.S. output was surging now face major issues over that leverage, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corp warned on Monday. During the plunge in crude oil prices, investors have punished exploration and production companies that had freely tapped capital markets for funds to drill new wells. Now, those same markets are penalizing pipeline companies formed as master limited partnerships (MLPs), which rely on growth to pay out rich dividends to investors in exchange for favorable tax treatment. “If you think debt is bad in the production business, the midstream has a lot more relatively,” Stephen Chazen, Occidental’s chief executive told the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston on Monday. Occidental does not have an MLP, a vehicle that soared in popularity when crude oil prices were much higher than those currently around $30 a barrel. “They were counting on growth in production that for now is not there. So that’s really a major issue for the midstream - trying to deal with way too much debt given the (dividend) promises made to limited holders.” He added that money would be tougher to come by. “They’re going to have to do something,” he said, mentioning selling assets or raising equity. “The debt is just not going to be there to roll over at a reasonable price.” Chazen said he believes the crude oil downturn has a lifespan of about three years, and the industry is about halfway through that cycle.

236,OXY,Debt swaps become a tough sell for cash-strapped US energy firms,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Highly-leveraged U.S. energy companies are struggling to carry out debt swaps as part of their survival strategy because plummeting oil and gas prices make investors either avoid such deals or demand tougher terms. Last year, at least 10 exploration and production companies, including California Resources Corp (CRC.N), managed to ease financial pressure by persuading investors to accept some losses on their bond holdings in return for new debt that often matures later and offers better collateral. Yet since prices tumbled further early this year, investors have grown more worried that some firms may not survive the rout. They see no point in accepting debt with potentially better collateral if it could mean nothing once the firm hits the wall. The deepening slump also means that producers need to offer more attractive terms - higher interest payments and more collateral - to win over investors and avoid the brutal equity wipeout that happens in most bankruptcies. “Investors are less desperate now since they’ve already taken a lot of the pain,” said Roopesh Shah, global chief of Goldman Sachs’ restructuring group. “They have less downside they’re trying to protect,” he said. Shah said debt exchanges were still viable, but needed to offer better protection and potential gains for investors.  That is a tall order for producers, which must conserve cash to make it through the price slump, and whose ability to issue new debt is limited by provisions in bond documents that tie debt to commodity prices. Pennsylvania-based Eclipse Resources Corp (ECR.N) that acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties in Ohio, canceled a debt exchange launched in January. Denbury Resources Inc (DNR.N), a Texas company with operations in the Rocky Mountains and along the Gulf of Mexico Coast, pulled a debt swap even after sweetening the deal for investors.  “Ultimately we terminated because it wasn’t attractive enough for us,” said Denbury spokesman Ross Campbell, adding that the company is still deciding whether to try another swap. Eclipse declined to comment. Chesapeake Energy Corp’s (CHK.N) and Vanguard Natural Resources LLC’s VNR.O exchange offers saw limited demand. Only about 20 percent of holders of Chesapeake bonds due in 2017 and 2018 took up the offer, even after Chesapeake doubled the amount of new debt it planned to issue. About 30 percent of eligible potential bondholders took part in Vanguard’s exchange.  The companies did not respond to requests for comment. With survival options dwindling, Roughly a third of U.S. oil producers, or 175 firms, is at risk of slipping into bankruptcy this year, according to a study by Deloitte, the auditing and consulting firm. About 40 hit the wall last year.  The deepening downturn has jeopardized other survival strategies, including selling assets to raise cash or buying back debt.      When California Resources, a spin-off of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), launched its debt exchange in November, it offered creditors 80 percent of face value - a premium of 11 to 23 percent - plus a hefty bump in interest rate. The company, which declined to comment, more than doubled the total amount of old debt investors could trade in.  In its canceled exchange, Eclipse Resources offered investors half of face value for bonds that had already cratered to 30 cents on the dollar, and a virtually unchanged coupon on the proposed new bonds.  Some swaps turned out to be disastrous for debtholders, which may be deterring others. New debt issued by Halcon Resources Corp (HK.N) in an exchange now trades below 15 cents on the dollar, after the exploration and production company completed another swap that offered investors higher security. The new California Resources debt has also plummeted, to close to 20 cents on the dollar.  As the crisis ripples through the energy sector, larger companies will also consider debt exchanges, until now mainly pursued by small producers, bankers said.  At least two firms are now seeking debt swaps. Rex Energy Corp REXX.O offers its creditors higher coupon and a second lien debt that comes ahead of unsecured debt plus equity for their holdings. Alta Mesa Holdings LP [ALMEH.UL] proposes to swap bonds for secured term loans. Rex declined to comment, and Alta Mesa did not respond to requests for comment. Swaps are not a silver bullet for issuers either. Linn Energy LLC LINE.O, whose bondholders agreed to an exchange last year, drew down a revolving credit line this year, a sign of potential trouble ahead.  The company did not immediately return a request for comment.

237,OXY,"Fund managers, convinced oil bottom is here, buy up energy stocks","NEW YORK (Reuters) - After several false starts over the last two years, U.S. fund managers are betting that energy stocks have finally hit bottom.  Firms including T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and American Funds have been adding shares of exploration and production companies that they say have the most to gain from oil prices stabilizing. The price of oil fell from $115 a barrel to $27.88 between June 2014 and January of this year, yet is up more than 50 percent since hitting its low.  The number of funds buying shares of ConocoPhillips jumped 144 percent over the last three months compared with the previous quarter, according to data from fund tracker Morningstar. Occidental Petroleum Corp, meanwhile, had a 110 percent increase in new owners. “The E&P; companies have taken the brunt of the pain that I think they will see in their business, so they will go into recovery faster and first,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood who has been adding to his exposure of the sector.  Some companies in the sector, such as Marathon Oil Corp and Devon Energy Corp have plugged holes in their balance sheets by selling assets and offering additional equity shares to investors, he said, allowing them to withstand a prolonged era of relatively low oil prices.  The rush of fund managers to buy exploration and production companies after several quarters of shedding them is one reason why the sector is up 9 percent for the year to date, outpacing both the 6.3 percent gain for energy stocks as a whole and the 1.8 percent gain in the broad Standard & Poor’s 500.  Overall, energy stocks remain the most underweight sector among fund mangers, with the average large cap fund holding approximately 1 percent less of its portfolio in the sector than its weight in the benchmark index, according to Lipper data. Fund managers say that they are buying exploration and production companies in part because they expect the oil glut to dwindle this year as production halts begin to take effect, setting up for a rally in revenue and earnings in 2017. “If you stop being negative on energy, you don’t want to buy a safe energy play, you want to buy a levered play,” said Ernesto Ramos, a portfolio manager at BMO Asset Management Company, referring to EOG Resources, whose revenues are closely tied to oil prices. Shares of the company are up 6.7 percent for the year to date, roughly half of the 14.6 percent increase in oil over the same time.  Overall, earnings among energy companies in the S&P; 500 are expected to fall 66.5 percent in 2016, before gaining 203.1 percent in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The prospects of a revenue and earnings rebound over the next two years is attracting growth-focused fund managers who have typically shied away from the energy sector.  Mike Pytosh, portfolio manager of the Voya MidCap Opportunities fund, said that he shifted his energy exposure during the January and February sell-off from refineries to exploration and production companies that were the hardest hit.  “It certainly got to a point where it was oversold. You have to not look at where the expectations are now, but where these companies will be a year or two out,” he said.

A fall in costs of oilfield services, coupled with increased productivity in the hydraulic fracturing process, has resulted in drastically lower costs for each new well, while yielding more barrels. Occidental said its production from U.S. fields increased to 302,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in the second quarter from 298,000,000 boe/d a year earlier, with increased output from its Permian resources in west Texas and southeast New Mexico contributing to that rise. The company’s production from ongoing operations, including its international business, rose to 609,000 boe/d from 552,000 boe/d. Occidental said it continues to reduce its exposure to non-core operations in the United States, the Middle East and North Africa. Occidental’s total cash operating costs for oil and gas production declined nearly 16 percent, but were outpaced by a 27 percent fall in revenue. The company’s net loss was $139 million, compared with a profit of $176 million, a year earlier.. Occidental’s loss per share of 18 cents matched analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $2.56 billion missed expectations of $3.04 billion.

The 485-mile (780-km) Cano Limon pipeline, which has the capacity to transport up to 210,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) from the field in Arauca province to the Caribbean coast, was shut down on Nov. 17 after bomb attacks attributed by the military to the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group. “At this moment production activities at the field are normal after being restarted and the pipeline to move the crude is working without problems,” General Alvaro Vicente Perez, head of the Army’s Quiron task force which provides security in the area, told Reuters. The pipeline resumed pumping several days ago and the oilfield resumed production this weekend, the military and an oil industry source said.  The oilfield, near the border with Venezuela, produces about 50,000 bpd.  The ELN regularly attacks oil installations despite imminent peace talks with the government. This year, attacks against Cano Limon have led to the loss of at least 22,000 barrels of crude, according to state oil company Ecopetrol.

OMV and Occidental agreed to develop the field along with state-owned National Oil Corp subsidiary Agoco in 2008 through an Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA). OMV has been present in Libya since 1975 and started production in 1985, the year it acquired 25 percent of Occidental’s producing assets in the country.

264,OXY,"INSIGHT-As oil recovers, U.S. firms descend on the Permian Basin in West Texas","ODESSA, Texas (Reuters) - In most U.S. shale oil regions, energy firms are making strategic but cautious bets as the price of oil holds above $50 a barrel. Here in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the largest U.S. oil patch, the industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year - more than triple what they spent in 2015.  Those deals set the stage for much larger investments needed to extract the oil from the ground - and they illustrate how the Permian Basin has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence after a historic oil price crash.  “We could easily see an extra 100 rigs out here in the Permian by June,” said Josh Clawson of Gesco, a Midland, Texas, electrical contractor for oil drilling rigs. That doesn’t necessarily mean the investment blitz will extend to other U.S. oil regions. The industry’s focus on the Permian reflects the simple math of profitability and a complex set of geographic advantages and technological advances that make it cheaper to drill here than in other major U.S. oil regions. Permian Basin producers make money at the current crude price CLc1 of about $53 per barrel because of the region’s sprawling pipeline network, abundant labor and supplies, and warm winters that allow year-round work. Most of America’s shale industry needs prices above $60 a barrel to justify new projects and expansion. Oil has not hit that price since June 2015. So at least for now, the Permian accounts for a disproportionate share of the industry’s recovery. The amount spent on Permian land purchases and leases last year represented 39 percent of all deals nationally and tripled the activity seen in any other major U.S. oil region.  Acquisitions in North Dakota’s Bakken shale fields, by comparison, accounted for 3 percent of all deals.  For a graphic comparing the land acquisitions in the Permian to other oil regions, see: tmsnrt.rs/2jHDopg Judging by the confident flow of capital into West Texas - a swagger bred in part by aggressive cost-cutting and innovation through the downturn - U.S. oil companies have retained their appetite for risk. What remains to be seen, should per-barrel prices rise further, is whether companies continue to expand operations in the Permian as projects start to make more economic sense in other oil states including North Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming. Oil companies started the new year with announcements of about $9 billion more in Permian land deals, including a $6.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) buy that doubled its acreage in the basin.  Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), WPX Energy (WPX.N), Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N) and RSP Permian Inc (RSPP.N) have also made major commitments to the region. The companies that have sold or leased their holdings have typically been smaller, privately-held firms aiming to take advantage of the high land prices rather than invest the millions of dollars needed to pump the oil. The demand for West Texas acreage has sent land prices soaring in the last two years. One deal in December 2016 priced out at more than $63,000 an acre, double the price paid in similar deal earlier that year.  Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC and its predecessor companies have made a fortune buying and selling Permian acreage starting in 2009.  But Double Eagle’s founders, who have snapped up 65,000 acres in the past two years, now plan to start drilling their holdings in addition to speculating on land values. The firm is preparing for an initial public offering with an expected valuation of $3 billion, according to a half dozen bankers who have examined its value. “Activity breeds activity,” said John Sellers, co-founder of Double Eagle, of the surge here. “The Permian is a really great basin to be in.” While land prices have risen fast, the cost of acreage still represents a small part of the profit equation. Most of the expense is tied to drilling and getting the oil to market. Buyers of Permian acreage are moving quickly to tap their holdings. The number of rigs across the basin is up more than 28 percent in the past year; oil job postings here have more than doubled from lows of last March; and sales tax receipts for the region starting rising in November after falling for two years. Oil firms are pumping 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from the Permian, about a quarter of U.S. output of 8.9 million bpd.

The resurgence gained momentum last summer when industry veteran Mark Papa’s Silver Run Acquisition Corp bought Centennial Resource Development Inc (CDEV.O), which controls premium acreage across the Permian.  Papa is considered one of the preeminent oil executives of his generation, and his move from retirement back into the oil patch was seen as a sign by many that the Permian was heating up again. Two months later, Apache Corp (APA.N) said it had accumulated over 300,000 acres of Permian land over two years for less than $1,300 an acre. “The Permian Basin represents the foundation of Apache’s North American growth strategy,” said Gary Clark, vice president of investor relations at Houston-based Apache. Apache estimated the land had more than 3 billion barrels of oil, sparking speculation that the Permian holds far more oil than anyone had expected in a previously overlooked part of the basin. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) sold acreage in east Texas earlier this month for $2.3 billion as it looked to raise cash to develop the 600,000 acres of Permian land it controls.  The firm is relocating 200 employees and their families to Midland, a sign of faith in the region’s long-term prospects.  Many of recent Permian deals were paid for with cash from secondary stock offerings, an unusual step that investors typically dislike because it dilutes their stakes in companies.

274,OXY,Occidental starts to suspend Colombia production after rebel attacks,"BOGOTA, March 1 (Reuters) - Crude oil production at the Cano Limon field, operated by US-based Occidental Petroleum Corp  in northern Colombia, is being gradually suspended after an escalation of rebel attacks on its pipeline, military and oil industry sources said on Wednesday. The Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which transports crude from the fields to a port in the Caribbean Sea for export, has been suspended since Feb. 15 because of a series of bomb attacks attributed by the military to the National Liberation Army (ELN), a Marxist rebel group. “At the moment 44 of 370 wells are reported shut down, storage capacity is at its peak,” a senior military official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. Occidental did not immediately respond to calls in Colombia from Reuters. The Cano Limon deposit, in Arauca province near the border with Venezuela, produces around 50,000 barrels per day. The 485-mile (780km) pipeline can carry up to 210,000 barrels per day. Attacks by the ELN on oil infrastructure have been frequent during the group’s five-decade war with the government. This year there have been 17 attacks on the pipeline and there were 43 last year, causing oil spills and environmental damage. Colombia’s conflict, which pit government troops against the ELN, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and right-wing paramilitary groups, has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions. President Juan Manuel Santos and the ELN last month launched formal peace negotiations in Ecuador, but the group has stepped up its attacks since. The group claimed responsibility for a bomb attack in Bogota last month that injured dozens of police officers. The ELN has about 2,000 combatants and opposes the presence of multinational companies in the mining and oil sector, claiming that they seize natural resources without leaving benefits to the country’s population or economy. The FARC, the biggest rebel group in the South American country, agreed to a peace accord with the government late last year.

276,OXY,Occidental profit beats; shares fall on weak output forecast,"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp’s quarterly profit beat estimates on Thursday but the company’s shares fell to a near eight-year low as the oil and gas producer forecast lower-than-expected production for the current quarter. Chesapeake Energy Corp’s shares also fell, after the company posted a bigger-than-expected decline in production, even as it spent more than analysts estimated. The fall in the companies’ shares came amid a selloff in the broader industry, triggered by a more than 4 percent fall in global oil prices.  Occidental expects full-year capital spending to be toward the high end of $3 billion-$3.6 billion it had forecast earlier in the year, Christopher Stavros, the company’s chief financial officer, said on a post-earning call.  Stavros cited a ramp up in activity in Texas’ Permian Basin - the focus of Occidental’s oil and gas operations. The company plans to deploy 11-13 rigs in the prolific shale field this year. The company, which recently sold natural gas assets in South Texas to fund Permian drilling, hinted at disposing some non-core acreage in the Permian basin. “The tail of our portfolio includes Permian Resources acreage that is not strategic to us, but synergistic and valuable to others,” Occidental’s Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said on the call. “This will be done as needed and opportunistically.”  The South Texas sale led to a reduction in Occidental’s 2017 production target.   The company now expects to produce 595,000-615,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) this year, lower than a prior estimate of 625,000-645,000 boe/d. Occidental forecast current quarter output of 580,000–595,000 boe/d. But the midpoint of that estimate fell short of the 633,000 boe/d analysts were expecting. The company’s worldwide production declined 11 percent to 584,000 boe/d on average in the first quarter. But higher oil prices during the quarter helped make up for the fall. The Houston, Texas-based company said it realized $49.04 per barrel of oil in the quarter, up from $29.42, a year earlier. Occidental’s profit rose 50 percent to $117 million, or 15 cents per share, in the latest quarter.   Excluding an asset impairment charge, Occidental’s profit was 16 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, higher than the analysts’ average estimate of 7 cents. The company shares fell as much as 3.8 percent to $57.91 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The fall in the companies’ shares came amid a selloff in the broader industry, triggered by a more than 4 percent fall in global oil prices.  Occidental expects full-year capital spending to be toward the high end of $3 billion-$3.6 billion it had forecast earlier in the year, Christopher Stavros, the company’s chief financial officer, said on a post-earning call.  Stavros cited a ramp up in activity in Texas’ Permian Basin - the focus of Occidental’s oil and gas operations. The company plans to deploy 11-13 rigs in the prolific shale field this year. The company, which recently sold natural gas assets in South Texas to fund Permian drilling, hinted at disposing some non-core acreage in the Permian basin. “The tail of our portfolio includes Permian Resources acreage that is not strategic to us, but synergistic and valuable to others,” Occidental’s Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said on the call. “This will be done as needed and opportunistically.”  The South Texas sale led to a reduction in Occidental’s 2017 production target.   The company now expects to produce 595,000-615,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) this year, lower than a prior estimate of 625,000-645,000 boe/d. Occidental forecast current quarter output of 580,000–595,000 boe/d. But the midpoint of that estimate fell short of the 633,000 boe/d analysts were expecting. The company’s worldwide production declined 11 percent to 584,000 boe/d on average in the first quarter. But higher oil prices during the quarter helped make up for the fall. The Houston, Texas-based company said it realized $49.04 per barrel of oil in the quarter, up from $29.42, a year earlier. Occidental’s profit rose 50 percent to $117 million, or 15 cents per share, in the latest quarter.   Excluding an asset impairment charge, Occidental’s profit was 16 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, higher than the analysts’ average estimate of 7 cents. The company shares fell as much as 3.8 percent to $57.91 on the New York Stock Exchange.

283,OXY,BlackRock switch helps pass 'historic' climate measure at Occidental,"BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Friday that it voted in favor of a successful shareholder proposal calling for more climate change reporting by Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), in the first sign the world’s largest asset manager was backing up its tough new talk on environmental matters.     Backers of the resolution called its passage a major victory, the first time such a measure succeeded at a major U.S. oil and gas company. Proponents said they were pleased by BlackRock’s support, which they had sought.     “Today’s historic vote puts the oil and gas industry on notice – the climate is changing and so are investor expectations of how companies should respond,” said Laura Campos, a director at the Nathan Cummings Foundation, one of the resolution’s proponents.     BlackRock (BLK.N), which has $5.4 trillion under management, traditionally has given few details of its reasoning behind specific proxy votes. On Friday, however, it said it was concerned about Occidental’s pace of disclosure to date. It also gave details about its talks with other companies such as Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which BlackRock said has provided more detail on climate risks it faces such as a recent report it published. A Chevron representative said the company would continue speaking with investors, and that it had held “extensive dialogue with proponents and other stockholders.”     BlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney said BlackRock would not explain every vote it casts in such detail but wanted to underscore how it promotes its corporate governance priorities in talks with companies.     “We want to highlight our engagement and articulate our voting decisions,” he said.     Occidental Chairman Eugene Batchelder said in an emailed statement: “We look forward to continuing our shareholder engagement on the topic and providing additional disclosure about the company’s assessment and management of climate-related risks and opportunities.” Major oil companies have long faced shareholder criticism for being slow to respond to climate concerns, though some have moved to mend fences with activists in recent years such as ExxonMobil’s (XOM.N) decision earlier this year to name a environmental expert to its board.     Specifically, the resolution at Occidental - which was also backed by Wespath Investment Management and state pension funds including the California Public Employees’ Retirement System - called on the energy company to explain the impact it could face from changes like new public policies on climate change, such as the 2016 Paris climate agreement.     BlackRock, Occidental’s largest investor with about 8 percent of its shares, last year had opposed a similar resolution, which failed to get a majority of support from investors.      In a statement sent by Sweeney explaining the switch, the fund firm said its vote last year was meant to give Occidental time. But despite talks with Occidental, “we remain concerned about the lack of discernable improvements to the company’s reporting practices” on climate issues, the statement said.     Last year a similar resolution was narrowly defeated with 249 million votes cast for it and 259 million votes cast against. The size of BlackRock’s holdings suggested its switch helped give the proposal a majority of support this year.

289,OXY,Exxon vote shows Wall St diverging from Trump on climate change,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Major investors put U.S. industry on notice on Wednesday that climate change matters, even as reports emerged that President Donald Trump plans to withdraw the United States from an international pact to fight global warming. A number of large institutional fund firms including BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, supported a shareholder resolution calling on Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to share more information about how new technologies and climate change regulations could impact the business of the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. The proposal won the support of 62.3 percent of votes cast. The victory, on such a wide margin, was hailed by climate activists as a turning point in their decades-long campaign to get oil and gas companies to communicate how they would adapt to a low-carbon economy. With major investors now seeing climate change as a major risk, activists said U.S. corporations will have to be more transparent about the impact of a warming planet even if the United States withdraws from the 2015 Paris climate accord, as Trump promised during his presidential campaign.  “Economic forces are outrunning any other considerations,” said Anne Simpson, investment director for sustainability at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, one of the sponsors of the resolution. She credited big investors in Exxon for the change, since at least some of them switched their votes after last year when a similar measure won just 38 percent support. “We have seen a sea change in their viewpoint,” she said. Many top investors now consider their votes on shareholder proposals “on merit, rather than considering it a test of loyalty to management,” she said. Among Exxon’s top investors, Vanguard Group Inc and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) opposed last year’s call for climate change reporting. A spokeswoman for Vanguard, which has about 7 percent of Exxon’s shares, declined to comment on its voting this year. A person familiar with the matter said funds run by BlackRock, which holds about 6 percent of Exxon shares, voted in favor of the climate resolution. Filings showing their exact votes are not due for months. But both fund firms and others have taken steps since last year to make it easier to support climate resolutions. A spokesman for Exxon’s ninth-largest investor Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O), Doug Holt, said it voted in favor of the proposal, citing its own guidelines updated in 2016. The investment firms’ approach reflects a new interest in climate matters among their own investors, who have stuffed  money into so-called “green” mutual funds and other vehicles that use environmental factors in their stockpicking. Wall Street’s priorities have shifted the terms of debate at a number of other energy and utility companies. A majority of shareholders voting at Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) and PPL Corp (PPL.N) called for similar reports on the risks of climate change. Votes on two more of the measures are scheduled for June 7 at Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) and at Hess Corp (HES.N).  Michael Crosby, involved in corporate outreach for the Midwest Capuchin Franciscans, a religious order, said Wednesday’s vote was a rejection of Exxon’s arguments it already provides enough detail on its outlook.  “The Street is saying, you have to give better evidence,” Crosby said. After the measure passed, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said its board would reconsider its climate communications.  The activists now face the task of maintaining alliances with leaders like Woods who opposed their resolutions but who in some cases support the 195-nation Paris agreement. Exxon said in a March 22 letter to the White House that the Paris deal is “an effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change.” Trump had at least one ally at Exxon’s meeting in Dallas, Steven Milloy of Potomac, Maryland, who urged other investors to support his resolution that would make it harder to file proposals like the one on climate change. Milloy said management should show less concerns for climate issues, which he called misplaced, and cited Trump as a model. “For the first time we have a president who actively opposes climate hysteria,” Milloy said. According to Exxon, Milloy’s proposal received support from 1.6 percent of votes cast.

290,OXY,Exxon climate vote puts sector on notice,"DALLAS (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil shareholders have finally won a long-sought climate-change victory. Over 60 percent of them backed a move that forces the $340 billion oil giant to ramp up global-warming disclosure, up from under 40 percent in a similar attempt last year. Exxon already embraces the debate more than most. But shareholders want the company to be more forthcoming. Holdout industry peers will have to follow or risk investor ire. Chief Executive Darren Woods, who took the helm at the beginning of the year, wrote in his first blog post about the importance of managing the risks of climate change. On several occasions Woods has talked about how Exxon does business in an environment in which, under the 2015 Paris accord, nearly 200 countries including China and India have agreed to reduce their carbon emissions. At the company’s annual meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, Woods reiterated Exxon’s commitment to adhere to the guidelines of the agreement even if President Donald Trump decides to withdraw the United States from the deal. Yet Exxon’s energy outlook remains fairly rosy, showing rising oil demand through 2040. Oil and gas development, Woods said, will still need $11 trillion of investment even under the constraints agreed in Paris. Some shareholders have for several years found this discussion unsatisfactory. They have asked Exxon to analyze in more depth the potential impact on the company’s business of limits on greenhouse-gas emissions, and to attempt to assess what might happen beyond 2040. And they have demanded access to independent directors to discuss their concerns. The difference this year is that more of them, potentially including big institutions like BlackRock, now want more information. Following Wednesday’s vote, the company has to oblige. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Woods was vague on Exxon’s plans to comply. It’s not the first time a U.S. company has gotten such a directive from shareholders – it happened at Occidental Petroleum earlier this month, for example – and greater disclosure is more common at European energy groups. Still, Exxon is the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company and it sets the standard. Others in the sector should consider themselves on notice.",5312017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxonmobil-climate-breakingviews/exxon-climate-vote-puts-sector-on-notice-idUSKBN18R2ZM
291,OXY,"RPT-Big oil, small U.S. towns see new reward in old production technique","(Repeats earlier story with no changes) * Carbon credit hike could insulate more U.S. oil from future busts * Occidental, Exxon, Chevron among the potential winners * Congress to consider boosting tax credit this summer By Ernest Scheyder HOBBS, New Mexico, June 5 (Reuters) - Amid the frenetic activity of American shale oilfields recovering from a two-year recession sit a handful of oil towns that seemed impervious as many producers went into bankruptcy and the economy around them sank. Occidental Petroleum Corp and a few other oil producers with wells near this town on New Mexico’s border with Texas steadily pumped low-cost oil through the downturn, using a technique that has been heralded worldwide as a way to reduce carbon emissions and boost oil output. “When everyone else in the oil industry was going down, Oxy kept working,” said Joshua Grassham, vice president of Lea County State Bank and a Hobbs Chamber of Commerce board member. The city of 35,000 rests on the Permian oilfield, the largest oilfield in the United States. This way of drilling brings with it a sweetener for the oil industry to keep crude flowing: a tax credit that helps insulate these wells in a downturn, and could triple in size if Congress approves a new measure this summer. Such a move could extend by decades the producing life of hundreds more wells, increasing oil supply which would be a drag on prices. To date, the technique has been employed only at conventional oilfields, rather than on shale deposits. Some firms are studying how to put the technique to work in shale drilling, too. The drilling method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from power plants, and forces it back into the fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface. Their success could be replicated in oilfields across the United States if Congress approves the measure, which already enjoys broad bipartisan support. While the Trump administration has yet to say whether it supports the tax credit increase, the measure could also be a boon to the coal industry, which Trump wants to revitalize. The technique, one of several so-called enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies used to prolong the productive lifespan of oilfields and increase output, underpins around five percent of U.S. oil output, or about 450,000 barrels per day, according to energy consultancy Advanced Resources International. EOR can help firms to produce between 30 percent and 60 percent of all the oil held in a reservoir. That’s far more than the 10 percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling, according to the Department of Energy. The existing credit has provided a financial lift for Occidental, Denbury Resources Inc and oil producers with ready access to the gas. Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp also use the technique on some of their oil fields. None detail their tax savings from the credit, but since the it was first offered in 2008, companies have collected at least $350 million in the credits, according to Internal Revenue Service figures. In Hobbs, Occidental not only kept a 200-person workforce intact during the oil-price downturn - when tens of thousands of workers were laid off in the shale patch - it also invested $250 million to expand operations during that period, according to its public filings. That meant Hobbs and nearby Seminole, Texas, where Hess Corp has its own carbon dioxide injection facility, didn’t suffer the extreme financial pain felt by shale towns, such as Williston, North Dakota, and other shale producing communities in 2015 and 2016. “Oxy’s investment in the carbon project was a huge economic boost to our area,” Grassham said. Some of the carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, comes from naturally occurring reservoirs that are a low-cost source for Occidental. Others get the gas piped from power plants that burn coal. Power companies hope the technique can help them avoid higher carbon emissions. The company spends about $18 to $25 per barrel to collect oil from its enhanced oil recovery operations. In contrast, its shale-focused well costs are lower - $16 to $19 per barrel. But because EOR wells pump consistently for decades, their value to the company over time exceeds shale wells, whose production quickly tapers off. Across Texas and New Mexico, Occidental runs one of the world’s largest fleet of enhanced oil recovery projects, injecting 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into wells that first produced oil nearly a century ago. “We had a very large, stable carbon dioxide EOR business in our portfolio during the downturn,” said Jody Elliott, president of Occidental’s American operations. “That helped.” Partly because of its carbon facilities, Occidental was able to raise its dividend during the downturn. Today, executives are using the profits from the carbon business to grow its shale business across the Permian, the largest acreage holding in the region. “These two businesses play very well off of each other,” Elliott said. Congress is expected this summer to debate extending an existing tax credit that could pave way for wider use. The proposed Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act would boost the credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, up from $10 per ton today. The legislation failed to move forward during last year’s heated presidential campaign, but supporters say it will be reintroduced soon. “We want to make sure that we show a strong commitment so we continue to develop these technologies,” said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat and the bill’s lead sponsor. Electricity generator NRG Energy Inc earlier this year opened a $1.04 billion carbon capture facility at a Texas coal-fired power plant, using its carbon dioxide emissions to extract crude from a 1930s-era oilfield. Expanding the credit could, supporters hope, encourage more coal-fired power plants to follow NRG’s lead by capturing and selling carbon to oil producers. Most oilfields are not located near carbon dioxide supplies, so the tax credit also could spur the build-out of carbon pipelines. Environmentalists, including the Sierra Club, like the process because it traps carbon underground, preventing it from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. “You’ll put more carbon in the ground than oil that is produced,” said Vello Kuuskraa, president of consultancy Advanced Resources International, which studies enhanced oil recovery and carbon storage. Oxy is considering investing another $550 million in its Hobbs operation in the next several years to further expand its carbon facilities. “During all these oil industry downturns, those carbon wells keep people working,” said Grassham.

Some of the carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, comes from naturally occurring reservoirs that are a low-cost source for Occidental. Others get the gas piped from power plants that burn coal. Power companies hope the technique can help them avoid higher carbon emissions. The company spends about $18 to $25 per barrel to collect oil from its enhanced oil recovery operations. In contrast, its shale-focused well costs are lower - $16 to $19 per barrel. But because EOR wells pump consistently for decades, their value to the company over time exceeds shale wells, whose production quickly tapers off. Across Texas and New Mexico, Occidental runs one of the world’s largest fleet of enhanced oil recovery projects, injecting 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into wells that first produced oil nearly a century ago.  “We had a very large, stable carbon dioxide EOR business in our portfolio during the downturn,” said Jody Elliott, president of Occidental’s American operations. “That helped.”  Partly because of its carbon facilities, Occidental was able to raise its dividend during the downturn. Today, executives are using the profits from the carbon business to grow its shale business across the Permian, the largest acreage holding in the region. “These two businesses play very well off of each other,” Elliott said.  Congress is expected this summer to debate extending an existing tax credit that could pave way for wider use. The proposed Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act would boost the credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, up from $10 per ton today. The legislation failed to move forward during last year’s heated presidential campaign, but supporters say it will be reintroduced soon. “We want to make sure that we show a strong commitment so we continue to develop these technologies,” said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat and the bill’s lead sponsor. Electricity generator NRG Energy Inc (NRG.N) earlier this year opened a $1.04 billion carbon capture facility at a Texas coal-fired power plant, using its carbon dioxide emissions to extract crude from a 1930s-era oilfield. Expanding the credit could, supporters hope, encourage more coal-fired power plants to follow NRG’s lead by capturing and selling carbon to oil producers. Most oilfields are not located near carbon dioxide supplies, so the tax credit also could spur the build-out of carbon pipelines.  Environmentalists, including the Sierra Club, like the process because it traps carbon underground, preventing it from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. “You’ll put more carbon in the ground than oil that is produced,” said Vello Kuuskraa, president of consultancy Advanced Resources International, which studies enhanced oil recovery and carbon storage. Oxy is considering investing another $550 million in its Hobbs operation in the next several years to further expand its carbon facilities. “During all these oil industry downturns, those carbon wells keep people working,” said Grassham.

293,OXY,Hess to sell Permian EOR assets to Occidental for $600 million,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hess Corp (HES.N) said on Monday it would sell its stake in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) for $600 million in cash. The deal cements Occidental’s status as the dominant U.S. producer of oil via carbon injection, a process favored by environmentalists and oil producers alike, and one that could grow in popularity if Congress expands a tax credit this summer. The EOR process harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil, from power plants or from natural sources, and forces it back into aging oil fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface. Occidental is not only buying out Hess’s stakes in carbon injection projects, but is also getting complete control of naturally occurring sources of underground carbon dioxide, a boost to the company’s bottom line. The cost of carbon is one of the largest expenses in EOR projects typically. For Hess, the deal gives it cash to further expand in North Dakota’s Bakken shale and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, areas in which it already invests heavily. The deal is expected to close by August. Shares of Hess fell about 1 percent to $43.25 in morning trading.  Separately, Occidental said it would sell remote acreage in the Permian for $600 million to undisclosed buyers and acquire other acreage closer to existing wells. The deals will effectively cut Occidental’s holdings in the Permian, America’s largest oilfield, by 13,000 acres. Occidental declined to disclose the buyer but said the deal was not connected to the Hess transaction. The company said the deals should help it, one day, to break even with oil prices CLc1 at $50 per barrel after paying its dividend.  Oil on Monday traded near $45 per barrel. “By monetizing assets in the tail of the portfolio that were not strategic to us, but are synergistic to other companies, we are creating value for our shareholders,” Vicki Hollub, Occidental’s chief executive, said in a statement.

297,OXY,CORRECTED-Rebel bomb attack halts Colombia's Cano Limon crude pipeline,"(Corrects second paragraph to show that Occidental operates the Cano-Limon oilfield, not the Cano-Limon pipeline) BOGOTA, June 20 (Reuters) - A bomb attack over the weekend by the Marxist ELN rebels has halted the flow of crude along Colombia’s second largest oil pipeline, the Cano-Limon Covenas, sources from the military and state-run oil company Ecopetrol said on Tuesday. The explosion took place on Saturday in a rural area of Saravena municipality, in the province of Arauca. Though the 485-mile (780-km) pipeline was stopped, operations at the Cano Limon field, operated by U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Corp , and exports were unaffected. Attacks on oil infrastructure by the National Liberation Army, or ELN, have been frequent during the group’s five-decade war with the government. There have been 32 bombings so far this year, according to Ecopetrol, and frequently cause environmental damage. The ELN has about 2,000 combatants and opposes the presence of multinational companies in the mining and oil sector, claiming that they seize natural resources without leaving benefits for the country’s population or economy. President Juan Manuel Santos and the ELN in February launched formal peace negotiations in Ecuador, but the group has stepped up its attacks since.

Oxy, one of the largest acreage holders in the Permian, expects to pump 169,000 to 173,000 boe/d in its shale operations there during the first quarter. “We remain committed to value-based production growth as we execute our returns-focused capital program in 2018,” Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement. Houston-based Oxy also said on Tuesday it would release its first climate report before the end of next month. Oxy’s shareholders last May approved a proposal calling for more climate change reporting by the company, the first time such a measure succeeded at a major U.S. oil producer. Shares of Oxy fell 2.5 percent to $68 in after-hours trading after closing slightly higher.

316,OXY,Occidental Petroleum reports swing to profit in Q4,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp posted a quarterly profit on Tuesday that met - but did not exceed - Wall Street’s expectations, sending shares down in extended trading. U.S. oil producers were helped in the fourth quarter by rising crude prices and increasing global demand, fueling strong expectations for earnings, though several have fallen short. Like Occidental, Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp also failed to beat Wall Street’s quarterly expectations.         Occidental posted fourth-quarter net income of $497 million, or 65 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $272 million, or 36 cents, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 41 cents per share, matching analyst’s expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Production rose about 7 percent to 621,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). For 2018, Oxy said it plans to spend $3.9 billion, about 7 percent higher from 2017 levels. Production should rise this year 8 percent to 12 percent, Occidental forecast. Much of the production increase should come in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. Oxy, one of the largest acreage holders in the Permian, expects to pump 169,000 to 173,000 boe/d in its shale operations there during the first quarter.  “We remain committed to value-based production growth as we execute our returns-focused capital program in 2018,” Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement.

317,OXY,"CORRECTED-U.S. spending bill expands carbon tax credit, boosting oil producers","HOUSTON (Reuters) - A little-noticed addition to the U.S. budget deal approved last week will help Occidental Petroleum Corp and other oil producers by more than tripling a tax credit for injecting carbon dioxide back into the earth to increase crude output. The tax-credit expansion, although supported by environmentalists and energy producers, had failed to move out of Congress during the 2016 presidential election. Its passage now likely will further boost already surging U.S. oil output in a year that production is forecast to hit 11 million barrels per day.  The injection process, used for more than 40 years to prolong output from traditional oil wells, also is being tested by Oxy and others as a way to speed more oil production from shale wells. President Donald Trump last week signed the spending plan into law. It boosts for 12 years an existing tax credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide injected underground, up from $10 per ton. “This will be an economic driver for our nation,” said  North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat who had pushed for the credit’s expansion with a bipartisan group of senators. “It will hopefully push a lot of innovative technologies across a range of industries, not just in coal or oil.” Oxy, Denbury Resources Inc and others inject more than 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into traditional oil wells, many of which came online more than 75 years ago.   The method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from electric-power plants, and forces it back into the fields. That helps drive more oil to the surface.     The technique, one of several enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies that can prolong the productive life of oilfields, underpins more than five percent of U.S. oil output, or about 450,000 barrels per day, according to energy consultancy Advanced Resources International. EOR can help firms extract between 30 percent and 60 percent of all the oil held in a reservoir. That’s far more than the 10 percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “This legislation helps to ensure domestic energy security,” Vicki Hollub, Oxy’s chief executive, said in a statement. EOR increases a producer’s costs, but because EOR wells pump consistently for decades, their value over time can exceed shale wells, whose production quickly tapers off. Oxy has not published anticipated financial benefits from the tax credit’s expansion, and Wall Street analysts who track the company have not offered any estimates. But partly because of its carbon operations, Oxy was able to raise its dividend during the oil price downturn from 2014 to 2016. Oxy this week swung to a fourth-quarter profit that met Wall Street’s expectations.

The company’s Permian Resource business, one of the largest shale oil producers in the largest U.S. oilfield, should break even - or generate as much cash as it spends - by the third quarter, CEO Vicki Hollub said at the Scotia Howard Weil conference in New Orleans. The company had previously expected to hit the target by January 2019, but improvements in logistics, operations and technology have moved up that deadline, Hollub said. “Achieving this cash flow neutrality is a milestone,” Hollub said. “We can now protect our shareholders in a lower-price environment.” (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",3272018,http://www.reuters.com/article/occidental-shale/occidental-sees-permian-shale-unit-at-breakeven-by-third-quarter-idUSL1N1R90ZC
