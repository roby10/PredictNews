ABC said it has licensed the two long-running daytime dramas to a Los Angeles-based production company in a multi-platform deal that “enables the soaps’ stories to continue beyond their finale dates on ABC.”  According to the statement, production company Prospect Park, which is behind the hit USA cable TV show “Royal Pains”, will produce the two shows in the same format and length as ABC, but make them available on new devices, including Internet-enabled TV sets.  “We are privileged to continue the legacy of two of the greatest programs to air on daytime television, and are committed to delivering the storylines, characters and quality that audiences have come to love for over 40 years,” Prospect Park said in a statement.  “‘All My Children’ and ‘One Life to Live’ are television icons, and we are looking forward to providing anytime, anywhere viewing to their loyal community of millions,” the statement added.  No date was given for when or where the new episodes would be available and it was not immediately clear whether the cast for the two shows would remain the same.  ABC’s decision in April to end the two soaps and replace them with new food, lifestyle and make-over shows was met with uproar from the dwindling amount of fans, some of whom organized petitions in a bid to save them.  “All My Children”, which made its debut in 1970, will broadcast its final episode on ABC on September 23, and “One Life to Live” will bow out in January 2012 after more than 40 years. “All My Children” has lost about one million regular viewers since 2006 and now attracts an audience of about 2.4 million.  Agnes Nixon, who created the two shows, said she was delighted they would have a new life.  “I’m excited for their future with Prospect Park,” Nixon added. “We are a big family that keeps going, and I’m looking forward to working alongside these wonderful people as we ensure that the shows will continue with all the love and excitement we’ve always had. I also am so happy for our loyal fans.”  Both “All My Children” and “One Life to Live” have won multiple awards and praise for tackling social issues like alcoholism, AIDS and illiteracy.

4,DIS,"CEOs wary of hiring, but sweat over jobless rate","BOSTON (Reuters) - Corporate America’s job engine is largely stalled, with chief executives waiting for a pickup in demand that would result from higher employment, yet wary of adding jobs in their own companies.  More than two years into a tepid recovery from a brutal recession, U.S. chief executives are unwilling to hire many new workers until demand picks up. But even they admit the demand they are counting on is directly tied to employment.  Data released on Friday showed that U.S. job growth was much weaker than expected in June, allowing the nation’s unemployment rate to creep back up to a six-month high of 9.2 percent and shaking executives’ confidence.  Continuing high unemployment has scared consumers off from making big purchases like cars — U.S. auto sales have been weak for the past two months — and left them looking for discounts on small-ticket items like clothing, helping chain stores rack up a better-than-expected June.  “Employment is not doing what it needs to do” to allow a rebound in demand for cars said Hyundai Motor America (005380.KS) Chief Executive John Krafcik.  “Jobs are still an issue, housing is still a big issue and I don’t think that’s talked about enough in the context of our industry. When people don’t have home equity, it’s often very difficult for them to pull that trigger and buy a new car,” Krafcik told reporters at Hyundai’s technical center outside Detroit.  CEOs have repeatedly expressed reluctance to add jobs. A June survey by the Business Roundtable found that just 51 percent planned to add staff in the United States over the next six months.  Executives attending this week’s Allen & Co media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, also expressed caution.  The head of U.S. media conglomerate Liberty Media LINTA.O, John Malone, fretted that the U.S. economy faced “real structural problems.”  “Politicians need to make tough decisions,” Malone told reporters.  President Barack Obama’s Democratic party and the opposition Republicans who control the House of Representatives are locked in a months-long battle over how to cut $4 trillion from the nation’s budget deficit over the next decade.  The budget battle is a concern for CEOs because it leaves them uncertain about the tax rates that both their companies and employees will pay, a top executive told Reuters.  “Everybody is very worried about it,” said Martin Richenhagen, CEO of AGCO Corp (AGCO.N), a maker of farm equipment that has added about 300 workers in the United States over the past year.  “I am in favor of having the discussion because this basically helps to clear the skies, but hopefully after several weeks they should come to some conclusion ... We need a clear vision on the tax situation.”  As long as demand remains spotty, CEOs see no reason to add jobs, said Keith Springer, president of Springer Financial Advisors in Sacramento, California.  “CEOs know that they don’t need to hire more people,” Springer said. “The President can talk all he wants about how corporate America needs to hire, but when you’re profitable and you’re able to sell all you can make and you don’t see any increased demand, you basically have reached equilibrium.”  Despite the weak jobs report, several executives at the Sun Valley media conference offered a mixed view of the economy.  Fixing things will “just take time,” said Barry Diller, chairman of IAC/Interactivecorp IACI.O.  Tom Staggs, chairman of Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) theme park arm, characterized recent events as a mixture of “good signs and bad signs.”  Some simply seemed to have tired of the United States’ lingering financial malaise, which has taken a heavier toll on the poor and middle class than on the occupants of the nation’s corner offices.  Designer Diane von Furstenberg, who arrived at the media conference separately from her husband Diller, exclaimed “that’s no fun!” when asked about the jobs numbers and kept walking.

6,DIS,"""Transformers"" global box office hits $645 million","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Big-budget action film “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” won the battle of the box office for the second-straight weekend, generating $140 million in global ticket sales and pushing its worldwide total since its debut to $645 million, studio estimates showed on Sunday.  The third installment of the popular “Transformers” films about shape-shifting aliens was the No. 1 film in the United States and Canada with $47 million in sales. It easily beat two new comedies, “Horrible Bosses” which took in $28 million, and family film “Zookeeper,” the weekend’s No. 3 movie with $21 million.  “Transformers” remained strong over the weekend internationally with $93 million in ticket sales from 59 markets, according to distributor Paramount Pictures.  Overall, the effects-filled Hollywood flick has now taken in $261 million in domestic theaters (the U.S. and Canada) to become the year’s highest-grossing movie, so far. And it has hauled in another $384 million overseas.  The success of the 3-D sci-fi flick also helped pull audiences into theaters for the new comedies, which generated decent sales amid low expectations during a summer weekend light on big new releases.  “‘Transformers 3’ is helping the overall marketplace by performing well,” said Paul Dergarabedian, box office analyst with Hollywood.com. The 52 percent drop in domestic ticket sales versus the film’s opening weekend last week was unusually low after a big opening, he said.  “Horrible Bosses,” which centers on three male friends who plot to kill their mean bosses, did better than expected as adult comedies like it and “Hangover 2” and “Bad Teacher” continued to appeal to fans this summer. “Bosses” stars Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis, along with Jennifer Aniston as one of the bosses.  “Zookeeper,” a family-oriented comedy starring Kevin James, also turned in a solid start domestically and good numbers overseas, distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment said. International sales hit $7.5 million, mostly from Germany and Mexico, on about 1,500 screens.  “Cars 2,” the sequel from Disney’s Pixar animation studio, claimed the No. 4 spot on domestic box office charts with $15 million, and the Cameron Diaz comedy “Bad Teacher” was fifth with $9 million.  “Transformers” was released by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom Inc., “Horrible Bosses” was distributed by Warner Bros., a division of Time Warner Inc., and “Zookeeper” and “Bad Teacher” were released by the studio division of Sony Pictures Entertainment, a unit of Sony Corp.

10,DIS,Eateries eye healthier kids' food amid pressure,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Nineteen U.S. restaurant chains, including Burger King and DineEquity’s IHOP, are backing an industry effort to serve and promote healthier meals for children.  The announcement on Wednesday from the National Restaurant Association (NRA) comes as public health officials and consumer advocates pressure restaurants to reduce calories in, and improve the nutritional value of, meals for children — nearly one in three of whom are either obese or overweight.  The 19 chains collectively operate some 15,000 restaurants that will participate in the trade group’s “Kids LiveWell” initiative, NRA said.  McDonald’s Corp, the world’s largest hamburger chain, is not among the 19.  Other participating brands include Au Bon Pain, Brinker International’s Chili’s Grill & Bar, Cracker Barrel, Denny’s, El Pollo Loco, Outback Steakhouse OSI and Sizzler.  The NRA said the voluntary program would focus on increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains and low-fat dairy, while limiting unhealthy fats, sugars and sodium.  Participants agreed to offer a children’s meal — comprising an entree, a side and a drink — with 600 calories or less that meets the above criteria.  They also promised to offer at least one other individual item with 200 calories or less.  “This is a great start to help empower consumers — kids and parents especially — with more healthier choices at restaurants,” Robert Post, deputy director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, said in a statement.  “It’s a good baby-step forward, but they have a lot more work to do,” said Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a consumer group that advocates healthier restaurant food for children.  “Kids’ meals aren’t the occasional indulgence that they once were. They are a regular part of children’s diets,” said Wootan, who hopes restaurant menus will one day offer a greater number of appealing healthy choices for youngsters.  As part of the effort, Burger King this month is removing French fries and soda as the default for its kids’ meals. Under the new system, diners will have to make a choice between those options or sliced apples, fat-free milk or juice before the order can be completed, a Burger King spokeswoman said.  Wootan called Burger King’s move the most significant piece of Wednesday’s announcement.  “There’s a huge body of literature showing that people stick with the default. We could leave the default to chance or try to make it better,” Wootan said, noting that restaurants at Walt Disney Co’s theme parks have shown that parents are more likely to choose healthier kids’ meal add-ons such as fruit and low-fat milk when those are the default option.  Some chains, including IHOP, already have lowered calorie counts on select menu items for children.  The “Kids LiveWell” initiative comes amid grass-roots efforts to force restaurants in the same direction.  For example, San Francisco and nearby Santa Clara County have passed laws that would curb free toy giveaways with unhealthy restaurant meals for children.  The restaurant industry has fought such efforts by backing laws that restrict local lawmakers’ ability to regulate restaurant marketing and other activities.  The CSPI last year sued McDonald’s to stop the chain from using Happy Meal toys to lure children into its restaurants. And last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics — a group of pediatricians — called for a ban on junk food ads aimed at children.  McDonald’s is not among the original participants in the “Kids LiveWell” initiative. Neither is sandwich chain Subway, which Wootan said offers the industry’s healthiest kids’ meals.  A McDonald’s spokeswoman said the company “will evaluate participation in this program in the future.”  Subway was not immediately available for a comment.

12,DIS,CORRECTED - US eateries eye healthier kids' food amid pressure," * 19 chains agree to offer healthier meals for children   * Participating restaurants include Burger King and IHOP   * Major chains like McDonald’s, Subway not involved   (Corrects Burger King menu choices in paragraph 11)   By Lisa Baertlein   LOS ANGELES, July 13 (Reuters) - Nineteen U.S. restaurant chains, including Burger King [BKCBK.UL] and DineEquity’s (DIN.N) IHOP, are backing an industry effort to serve and promote healthier meals for children.   The announcement on Wednesday from the National Restaurant Association (NRA) comes as public health officials and consumer advocates pressure restaurants to reduce calories in, and improve the nutritional value of, meals for U.S. children — nearly one in three of whom are either obese or overweight.   The 19 chains collectively operate some 15,000 restaurants that will participate in the trade group’s “Kids LiveWell” initiative, it said.   Other participating brands include Au Bon Pain, Brinker International’s (EAT.N) Chili’s Grill & Bar, Cracker Barrel (CBRL.O), Denny’s (DENN.O), El Pollo Loco, Outback Steakhouse OSI [OSI.UL] and Sizzler.   The NRA said the voluntary program would focus on increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains and low-fat dairy, while limiting unhealthy fats, sugars and sodium.   Participants agreed to offer a children’s meal — comprising an entree, a side and a drink — with 600 calories or less that meets the above criteria.   They also promise to offer at least one other individual item with 200 calories or less.   “This is a great start to help empower consumers — kids and parents especially — with more healthier choices at restaurants,” Robert Post, deputy director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, said in a statement.   “It’s a good baby-step forward but they have a lot more work to do,” said Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a consumer group that advocates healthier restaurant food for children.   “Kids’ meals aren’t the occasional indulgence that they once were. They are a regular part of children’s diets,” said Wootan, who hopes restaurant menus will one day offer a greater number of appealing healthy choices for youngsters.   As part of the effort, Burger King this month is removing French fries and soda as the default for its kids’ meals. Under the new system, diners will have to make a choice between those options or sliced apples, fat-free milk or juice before the order can be completed, a Burger King spokeswoman said.   Wootan called Burger King’s move the most significant piece of Wednesday’s announcement.   “There’s a huge body of literature showing that people stick with the default. We could leave the default to chance or try to make it better,” Wootan said, noting that restaurants at Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) theme parks have shown that parents are more likely to choose healthier kids’ meal add-ons such as fruit and low-fat milk when those are the default option.   Some chains, including IHOP, already have lowered calorie counts on select menu items for children.   The “Kids LiveWell” initiative comes amid grass-roots efforts to force restaurants in the same direction.   For example, San Francisco and nearby Santa Clara County have passed laws that would curb free toy giveaways with unhealthy restaurant meals for children.   The restaurant industry has fought such efforts by backing laws that restrict local lawmakers’ ability to regulate restaurant marketing and other activities. [ID:nN04121121]   The CSPI last year sued McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) to stop the world’s largest hamburger chain from using Happy Meal toys to lure children into its restaurants. And last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics — a group of U.S. pediatricians — called for a ban on junk food ads aimed at children. [ID:nN1515887] [ID:nN1E75Q1TF]   McDonald’s is not among the original participants in the “Kids LiveWell” initiative, but neither is sandwich chain Subway — which Wootan said offers the industry’s healthiest kids’ meals.

15,DIS,"Netflix price rise draws user ire, investor glee","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc’s hefty price increase provoked an unprecedented outpouring of outrage on the Internet, but Wall Street cautiously welcomed the move, sending its shares up nearly 3 percent on Wednesday.  Thousands of subscribers complained on Netflix’s official blog with many threatening to cancel subscriptions after the fast-growing video service raised prices by up to 60 percent for users of both its streaming and DVD-mail service.  Many said they would consider options such as Hulu, the Internet video service owned by Comcast Corp NBC Universal, News Corp, Walt Disney Co and Providence Equity Partners, or even Redbox, whose once booming kiosk-rental service had been eclipsed by online, instant Web offerings.  “Who’s genius idea is this crap?” said one comment on the Netflix blog, which promised to cancel service. “Your streaming selection sucks and the Red Box is looking better and better these days!”  The higher prices clearly stirred passions among the company’s subscribers, but Netflix brushed off the criticism as expected from a vocal minority.  “We knew there would be some people who would be upset,” company spokesman Steve Swasey said.  The increase amounts to $6 a month for one DVD at a time plus unlimited streaming.  “To most people, it’s a latte or two,” he added.  The company expects some cancellations, Swasey said, but he declined to say how many.  Some industry analysts argued the higher prices should make up for cancellations, in part by driving customers toward more profitable Netflix plans.  Subscribers who cancel are likely to be in lower-priced plans, with one DVD at a time, who turn in more DVDs, said Goldman Sachs analyst Ingrid Chung.  “Gross margins should benefit as we believe that the majority of lower-priced (subscribers) were less profitable for Netflix,” Chung said in a research note.  Lower-priced subscribers also might be drawn to the streaming service, “which has very incremental margin,” wrote Chung, who has a “buy” rating on Netflix shares.  The new prices take effect immediately for new subscribers and in September for current customers.  Netflix’s price rise comes as it finds itself writing increasingly large checks for the rights to the movies and TV shows its customers expect to find from its streaming service.  In one such deal, Netflix renewed on Wednesday a multi-year agreement with Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal, giving it rights to stream previous season hits such as “The Office” and Parenthood” from NBC and series, including “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” and “Psych”, from its cable networks. The financial details were not disclosed.  Netflix said on Tuesday it was raising by 60 percent the monthly price of a plan that lets subscribers watch unlimited movies and video online and get DVDs by mail.  The price for unlimited streaming plus rental of one DVD at a time will run about $16, up from about $10. Subscribing to just streaming, or just one DVD at a time, costs about $8.  One comment on the Netflix blog was more accepting.  “If you can improve your streaming selections it would be a benefit. I now pay the price of both anyway so I don’t see a downside for me,” wrote a person identified as “Scott.”  While customers vented on the Netflix blog and Facebook page, the company’s shares rose 2.6 percent to close at $298.73 on Nasdaq.

17,DIS,Lesser-known networks spark Emmy buzz in Hollywood,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - With 104 Emmy nominations on Thursday, cable TV’s HBO again dominated rival networks for the industry’s highest awards, but several nods from lesser-known networks truly had Hollywood talking.  ReelzChannel, whose focus is showing feature films and original programs about Hollywood movies, took on a big risk when it aired controversial TV miniseries “The Kennedys” back in April, but the move paid off in viewership and Emmy nods.  The network earned 10 of the highly coveted nominations, where before it hadn’t had any, including a nod for best miniseries or movie and one each for Greg Kinnear and Barry Pepper in the category of best actor.  After football drama “Friday Night Lights” was punted from the NBC network, satellite TV operator DirecTV put the show on its Audience Network for original programs. The satellite operator’s reward: four nods including for the top Emmy, best TV drama series, and one each for Kyle Chandler as best dramatic actor and Connie Britton, best dramatic actress.  The Starz network, too, brought in nine Emmy nods for its shows “Pillars of the Earth,” “Spartacus: Gods of the Arena” and “Camelot.”  The nods underscore a trend in TV that has seen dramas, which in recent years generally have appealed to more narrowly targeted audiences, being replaced on network TV by reality and competition programs that are aimed at broad viewership.  Operations like ReelzChannel or Audience Network with fewer viewers can take the top-quality dramas and use them to attract new audiences, which only enhances overall viewership.  “On cable, we are seeing a strong point of view which is extremely original. Cable TV has a very specific audience. It is a niche market for the most part,” said John Shaffner, chairman of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.  Stan E. Hubbard, chief executive of ReelzChannel made the decision to pick up “The Kennedys” when The History Channel pulled it from its lineup. The miniseries had drawn fire from some critics who claimed it painted an unflattering portrait of slain U.S. President John F. Kennedy and his family.  But with controversy comes publicity, and that often lures viewers who want to see what all the fuss is about.  “Our daily average ratings have doubled since we announced ‘The Kennedys’ was coming,” Hubbard said. The Emmy nod, he said, should only bring more attention to the channel, and he added that the nomination validated the production’s quality.  The Audience Network is somewhat different. Because the channel is owned by subscriber-based DirecTV, its aim is less about attracting new viewers and more about retaining current ones, said Patty Ishimoto, general manager of original entertainment at DirecTV.  Still, she said the move toward original programing and high-quality dramas — Audience Network recently picked up the Glenn Close show “Damages” — has been a success.  To be sure, the nods for ReelzChannel, Audience Network and Starz are small by comparison to the likes of mighty HBO with its flashy, expensive productions such as “Boardwalk Empire” and “Mildred Pierce” — Emmy’s most-nominated program.  CBS garnered 50 nominations to be the second most-nominated network. NBC had 46, Fox 42, and ABC 40.  But it was only a few years back that the same things were being said about cable network AMC, and now it is considered one of the key stops on TV remote controls for quality drama after multiple Emmy wins for “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad.”  ",7142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-emmys-networks/lesser-known-networks-spark-emmy-buzz-in-hollywood-idUSTRE76D72N20110714
18,DIS,Drew Peterson demands halt to TV movie on murder case,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Accused murderer Drew Peterson has demanded a halt to a planned TV movie about his case starring actor Rob Lowe, his lawyer said on Thursday.  “Ladykiller: The Drew Peterson Story,” which Hollywood industry websites said last month was being filmed for Lifetime television, is based on what Peterson’s attorney called an “extremely opinionated, blatantly biased, less than seriously researched and defamatory book.”  The movie could also bias potential jurors against Peterson, a former suburban Chicago police officer who is awaiting trial in the death of his third wife, attorney Walter Maksym said.  The “cease and desist” letter was addressed to Lowe, Lifetime Entertainment and its parent companies, A&E Television Networks, Disney/ABC Television Group, Hearst Corporation, and other entities.  Maksym said he sent the letter Wednesday evening and had not received any responses.  Peterson has pleaded not guilty to the 2004 killing of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, who was found dead in the couple’s bathtub in what was initially termed an accidental drowning but later ruled a homicide.

21,DIS,Smoking in youth-pitched U.S. films plummets," * Smoking policies by three major studios cited   * R rating suggested for movies with tobacco use   By David Beasley   ATLANTA, July 14 (Reuters) - Far fewer top-grossing U.S. films aimed at young audiences feature smoking scenes, a possible factor in the decline in cigarette use among middle and high school students, health officials said on Thursday.   Tobacco use appeared on-screen 595 times in 2010 in top movies rated G, PG or PG-13, a 71.6 percent drop from 2005, according to a survey by a nonprofit group, Breathe California of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails.   The survey was published on Thursday in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.”   The drop in on-screen tobacco use largely can be attributed to policies by three major film studios, Time Warner TWC.N (TWX.N), Disney (DIS.N) and Comcast (CMCSA.O), which discourage smoking in their films, said Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco who contributed to the CDC article.   Tobacco use in youth-rated movies by those three companies dropped 95.8 percent from 2005 to 2010, compared to 41.7 percent among companies without such policies, the CDC said.   “What this shows is that those policies have been working,” Glantz told Reuters.   The CDC article concluded that the decreased presence of on-screen smoking might have contributed to less smoking among youths.   From 2000 to 2009, tobacco use among middle school students declined from 15.1 percent to 8.2 percent and among high school students from 34.5 percent to 23.9 percent, the CDC reported last August.   In 2007 the Motion Picture Association of America announced that scenes glamorizing smoking could affect a rating.   The World Health Organization and other groups have recommended an automatic R, or restricted, rating for movies featuring tobacco use, unless the film portrays an historical figure who smoked or depicts the harm of smoking, according to the CDC.   An R rating means children under age 17 require an accompanying parent or adult guardian.   “Adoption of this policy could further reduce tobacco incidents in youth-rated movies,” the CDC report said.

ABC’s “Modern Family,” which took the top comedy prize last year, earned a total of 17 nominations, including mentions for stars Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara.  Other contenders in the best drama series race were HBO’s new prohibition era series “Boardwalk Empire” with a total of 18 nods, CBS legal program “The Good Wife,” freshman fantasy “Game of Thrones,” “Dexter” and “Friday Night Lights.”  Among comedy series, “Modern Family” will face off for best program against veteran “30 Rock,” first time nominee “Parks and Recreation,” “The Big Bang Theory” and “The Office.”  Fox’s quirky musical comedy “Glee”, which dominated last year’s Emmy nominations, got just 12 mentions this year, including best comedy and supporting acting nods for Chris Colfer and Jane Lynch. But it failed to grab any spots in the lead acting categories.  HBO’s miniseries “Mildred Pierce” had the largest number of nominations with a total of 21, including nods for its stars Kate Winslet and Evan Rachel Wood.  Five of the 12 nominated comedy and drama series are first time nominees. The acting categories featured a slew of Emmy rookies including Melissa McCarthy in freshman comedy “Mike & Molly,” Martha Plimpton for “Raising Hope,” Mireille Enos in the AMC crime drama “The Killing” and Timothy Olyphant in the modern Western drama “Justified” on FX.  “It is great that we are recognizing the spectrum of television. We are here to celebrate television and let our audience around the world know how great TV is,” said John Shaffner, chairman of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.  The Emmys will be handed out at a ceremony in Los Angeles on September 18, hosted by “Glee” star Jane Lynch.  HBO was again the most nominated network, despite a controversial decision this year to merge the miniseries and TV movie categories, which the cable channel has traditionally dominated.  HBO garnered 104 nominations overall, followed by CBS with 50, NBC with 46, Fox 42, and ABC with 40.  Some of TV’s favorite stars were recognized on Thursday in new roles. They included former “Friends” actor Matt LeBlanc, who plays a version of himself in the Showtime satire “Episodes,” and Betty White, age 89, who earned her 17th Emmy nomination for a supporting role in comedy “Hot in Cleveland.”  Cloris Leachman, age 85, notched her 22nd nod for a supporting role as the ditzy grandmother in Fox show “Raising Hope,” while veteran Kathy Bates scored a lead actress nomination for playing a cranky lawyer in the new NBC drama “Harry’s Law.”  ",7142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-emmys/mad-men-modern-family-to-defend-emmy-wins-idUSTRE76D2O820110714
23,DIS,"""Harry Potter"" whips up early magic at box offices","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Even before its U.S. debut, the new “Harry Potter” movie is conjuring a lot of magic at box offices, taking in $43.6 million overseas on its opening day and sending advance U.S. ticket sales to record levels.  Warner Bros., the film studio behind the new “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,” on Thursday said the movie’s debut in 26 countries one day earlier was 87 percent higher than its predecessor film, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1” and 49 percent above 2009’s “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.”  Of the total international box office, about 65 percent was coming from 3D screens, which should help support the market for 3D movies which has seen some weakness this year. Highlights included the biggest opening days ever for movies in countries from Australia to Russia and Italy.  In the United States, the world’s largest movie market, “Deathly Hallows - Part 2” debuts in midnight screenings Thursday and is breaking records for advance ticket sales.  Online ticket seller Fandango.com said more than 6,000 midnight shows are sold out on the website, and it has sold more tickets for midnight and early morning screenings of “Deathly Hallows - Part 2” than any other movie, including “The Dark Knight” and “Twilight” series film, “New Moon”.  Another online ticket seller, MovieTickets.com, said it had sold out 4,500 screenings and the movie appears to be headed toward becoming one of the top 2 advance sellers of all time.  The early returns bode well for the final movie in the smash hit series of films that, in its previous seven incarnations, has taken in more than $6.4 billion at global box offices for Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc..  Estimates for opening weekend ticket sales of “Deathly Hallows — Part 2” in the United States and Canada range from $125 million to $150 million, industry watchers said, putting it in league with the highest-grossing film debuts ever.

24,DIS,'Harry Potter' whips up early magic at box offices," LOS ANGELES, July 14 (Reuters) - Even before its U.S. debut, the new “Harry Potter” movie is conjuring a lot of magic at box offices, taking in $43.6 million overseas on its opening day and sending advance U.S. ticket sales to record levels.   Warner Bros., the film studio behind the new “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,” on Thursday said the movie’s debut in 26 countries one day earlier was 87 percent higher than its predecessor film, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1” and 49 percent above 2009’s “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.”   Of the total international box office, about 65 percent was coming from 3D screens, which should help support the market for 3D movies which has seen some weakness this year. Highlights included the biggest opening days ever for movies in countries from Australia to Russia and Italy.   In the United States, the world’s largest movie market, “Deathly Hallows - Part 2” debuts in midnight screenings Thursday and is breaking records for advance ticket sales.   Online ticket seller Fandango.com said more than 6,000 midnight shows are sold out on the website, and it has sold more tickets for midnight and early morning screenings of “Deathly Hallows - Part 2” than any other movie, including “The Dark Knight” and “Twilight” series film, “New Moon”.   Another online ticket seller, MovieTickets.com, said it had sold out 4,500 screenings and the movie appears to be headed toward becoming one of the top 2 advance sellers of all time.   The early returns bode well for the final movie in the smash hit series of films that, in its previous seven incarnations, has taken in more than $6.4 billion at global box offices for Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc. (TWX.N).   Estimates for opening weekend ticket sales of “Deathly Hallows — Part 2” in the United States and Canada range from $125 million to $150 million, industry watchers said, putting it in league with the highest-grossing film debuts ever.

29,DIS,"""Mad Men,"" ""Modern Family"" to defend Emmy wins","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Stylish 1960s advertising drama “Mad Men” and mockumentary comedy “Modern Family” will vie again for the top prizes at the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards in a field packed with newcomers and veteran actors in new roles.  “Mad Men,” the three-time Emmy winner for best dramatic show, scored 19 nominations on Thursday for TV’s highest honors, including best drama series and acting nods for its stars Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss.  ABC’s “Modern Family,” which took the top comedy prize last year, earned a total of 17 nominations, including mentions for stars Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara.  Other contenders in the best drama series race were HBO’s new prohibition era series “Boardwalk Empire” with a total of 18 nods, CBS legal program “The Good Wife,” freshman fantasy “Game of Thrones,” “Dexter” and “Friday Night Lights.”  Among comedy series, “Modern Family” will face off for best program against veteran “30 Rock,” first time nominee “Parks and Recreation,” “The Big Bang Theory” and “The Office.”  Fox’s quirky musical comedy “Glee”, which dominated last year’s Emmy nominations, got just 12 mentions this year, including best comedy and supporting acting nods for Chris Colfer and Jane Lynch. But it failed to grab any spots in the lead acting categories.  HBO’s miniseries “Mildred Pierce” had the largest number of nominations with a total of 21, including nods for its stars Kate Winslet and Evan Rachel Wood.  Five of the 12 nominated comedy and drama series are first time nominees. The acting categories featured a slew of Emmy rookies including Melissa McCarthy in freshman comedy “Mike & Molly,” Martha Plimpton for “Raising Hope,” Mireille Enos in the AMC crime drama “The Killing” and Timothy Olyphant in the modern Western drama “Justified” on FX.  “It is great that we are recognizing the spectrum of television. We are here to celebrate television and let our audience around the world know how great TV is,” said John Shaffner, chairman of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.  The Emmys will be handed out at a ceremony in Los Angeles on September 18, hosted by “Glee” star Jane Lynch.  HBO was again the most nominated network, despite a controversial decision this year to merge the miniseries and TV movie categories, which the cable channel has traditionally dominated.  HBO garnered 104 nominations overall, followed by CBS with 50, NBC with 46, Fox 42, and ABC with 40.  Some of TV’s favorite stars were recognized on Thursday in new roles. They included former “Friends” actor Matt LeBlanc, who plays a version of himself in the Showtime satire “Episodes,” and Betty White, age 89, who earned her 17th Emmy nomination for a supporting role in comedy “Hot in Cleveland.”  Cloris Leachman, age 85, notched her 22nd nod for a supporting role as the ditzy grandmother in Fox show “Raising Hope,” while veteran Kathy Bates scored a lead actress nomination for playing a cranky lawyer in the new NBC drama “Harry’s Law.”  ",7152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-emmys/mad-men-modern-family-to-defend-emmy-wins-idUSTRE76D2O820110715
30,DIS,Hollywood turns on the starpower for Comic-Con,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Heading into this year’s giant Comic-Con International pop culture convention in San Diego, media watchers believed Hollywood might play a smaller role because some heavily promoted movies there in 2010 fizzled at box offices.  But as Thursday’s opening day nears, the 2011 gathering of comic book readers, sci-fi lovers, fanboys, fangirls and pop culture watchers — many costumed as space aliens or invaders — appears bigger, glitzier and more crowded than ever.  Forecasters predict anywhere from 130,000 to as many as 200,000 people will invade San Diego over the four-day convention, although numbers are difficult to track given the volume of people who come just to be part of the scene.  Perhaps the most accurate indicator of the show’s growing popularity in recent years is that while it took six months for four-day event passes to sell out in 2009, and two months in 2010, this year those passes were gone in a mere seven hours.  And rabid fans likely won’t be disappointed with the number of events and starpower at the show nicknamed, “The Con”.  There are numerous panels for directors and stars to talk up films such as “Twilight: Breaking Dawn” and “The Amazing Spider-Man,” as well as several science-fiction TV shows. Even the cast of hit musical “Glee” will be on hand.  Although, similar promotional events in 2010 failed to have a big impact on the commercial prospects of some films and TV shows hyped here, such as “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” Hollywood’s studios and networks are back in force.  “I don’t think there is a direct relation between box office and what you do at Comic-Con,” Marc Weinstock, president of worldwide marketing for Sony Pictures, told Reuters.  “For ‘Total Recall,’ ‘Ghost Rider,’ and ‘The Amazing Spider-Man’ we’ll be showing footage no one has ever seen. People are going to be very, very excited,” Weinstock said.  But there is a difference this year, which boils down to timing. Generally speaking, Hollywood has used past Comic-Cons to build early buzz for movies and TV shows opening months away, but this year the big promotional bucks are being spent on films opening around the same time as the convention.  For instance, Marvel Studios is teaming Chris Evans, star “Captain America: The First Avenger,” with U.S. troops in a made-for-media event to coincide with Friday’s release of the movie. Universal Pictures’ “Cowboys & Aliens,” which opens July 29, is holding its world premiere on Saturday in San Diego.  Comic-Con stargazers will hardly be disappointed. Besides Steven Spielberg — at the show for the first time to both promote his new film “The Adventures of Tin Tin” and collect an award — others attending include Taylor Lautner, Jeff Bridges, Francis Ford Coppola, Justin Timberlake and Charlize Theron.  “I don’t know what to expect this year, but one thing I can expect is that it’s going to bigger than it’s ever been,” said Brannon Braga who, after first attending as a fan in the 1980’s, this year is presenting the first hour of the $16 million two-hour season premiere of sci-fi adventure TV show “Terra Nova,” which he co-produced with Spielberg.  Some of the other, more talked-about new TV shows anxious to woo crowds at The Con include fantasy-themed “Grimm” and “Once Upon a Time,” along with “Person of Interest” and “Alcatraz,” both produced by “Lost” creator J.J. Abrams.  The casts and creators from “Dexter,” “Supernatural,” “True Blood,” and “The Big Bang Theory” also will appear, buttressing their already loyal fan bases from past trips to Comic-Con.  “Breaking through the clutter becomes harder every year,” said Syfy Channel marketing vice-president Dana Ortiz, who will be making her 11th trip to Comic Con this year.  For cable TV channels like SyFy, Comic-Con is the perfect opportunity to market to, and get feedback from, a highly-targeted group of viewers. In fact, the team at SyFy begins planning for Comic-Con just after Christmas.  And for fans who can’t get to San Diego, Syfy has a solution. It has partnered with the E! Network to provide red carpet coverage of its annual party via online streaming. So, this year fans stuck at home will have the chance to see for themselves what the pop culture fuss is all about.

32,DIS,"""Harry Potter"" rings up record $476 million globally","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The final “Harry Potter” film shattered box office records worldwide with a whopping $168.6 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales over the opening weekend and nearly $476 million globally.  The staggering domestic total for “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2” is the best three-day opening for a film ever, distributor Warner Bros said on Sunday. It beat the previous record of $158.4 million over the initial three days for the 2008 Batman movie, “The Dark Knight.”  Internationally, the finale for “Harry Potter” captured $307 million in 59 countries since it opened last week, another record. That includes weekend sales plus Wednesday and Thursday for some markets.  The prior record for an overseas opening belonged to “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,” the fourth installment of the series released in May, which took in about $260 million outside North America in its debut.  The eighth film in the “Harry Potter” series about a teenage wizard and his friends battling against evil also set records for the largest opening-day domestic sales total, largest midnight screenings and largest opening on giant IMAX screens.  The movie took in an average $38,526 on more than 4,300 screens, according to Warner Bros, a unit of Time Warner Inc. It was the first “Potter” film also released in 3D.  “Harry Potter,” already the highest-grossing film franchise ever with over $6.4 billion in global ticket sales, is based on the novels of British author J.K. Rowling.  The massive numbers for “Deathly Hallows — Part 2” showed the story still enchants audiences a decade after Harry’s first film adventure was released.  “It’s become a cultural event,” said Dan Fellman, head of domestic distribution for Warner Bros. Young fans stuck with the series as they grew up and the audience expanded over the years, Fellman said, adding that final global ticket receipts could “easily” reach the rare $1 billion mark.  The “Harry Potter” magic dwarfed other films over the weekend, but there were a couple of notable events.  Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris” reached a milestone by hitting $41.8 million in domestic sales since its release, making it the highest-grossing film in North America from director Allen, according to distributor Sony Pictures Classics.  “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” took the No. 2 spot on U.S. and Canadian box office charts with an estimated $21.3 million over three days, distributor Paramount Pictures said. The film ranks as the year’s first film to top $300 million in domestic sales with $302.8 million total.  Rounding out the weekend’s top five domestic films were “Horrible Bosses” with $17.6 million, “Zookeeper” with $12.3 million and “Cars 2” with $8.3 million. Disney’s new “Winnie the Pooh” movie finished sixth with $8 million.  “Deathly Hallows — Part 2” and “Horrible Bosses” were released by Warner Bros.

35,DIS,"Stan Lee reveals details of new comic ""Seekers""","SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Comic book legend Stan Lee on Friday revealed details of his new web-based, digital series “The Seekers,” saying it is set in modern times on an Earth in danger of imminent destruction.  Describing his upcoming new venture with MTV as “a real epic story”, Lee told Reuters that “Seekers” will have multiple characters and he hopes it will move from the Internet to TV, movies and videogames.  “It’s a real epic story,” said Lee, ahead of a detailed presentation of the new comic book series on Saturday at Comic-Con International.  “One of the blurbs I wrote for it says, ‘We present these incidents that you’re about to witness as a work of fiction in order to avoid worldwide apprehension and panic.’ It has to do really with the state of the Earth and all the population on it,” he added.  “The Seekers” will launch in early 2012 as a free digital comic series on the MTV Geek website and is expected to eventually become a print comic. Lee, 88, has big plans for what will be his first foray into digital comics.  “Television, movies, video games, you name it, it will be there,” said Lee, who helped create Marvel Comics superheroes “Spider-Man”, “Thor” and “Iron Man”.  Lee said he has written a six-page treatment for “The Seekers”. Thousands of years ago an alien race sent “seekers” to every planet in the universe with sentient life. When a race advances enough to a point that it might be a threat to other sentient life across the galaxy, these seekers have the ability to set off a doomsday device that will destroy the planet.  “Our whole planet is in danger,” said Lee. “It has to do with man’s inhumanity to man.”  Three of the main characters will be;  — The Gatherer, a seeker sent to Earth, who has recently awakened due to the nuclear and biological threats humans now harness.  — Arthur Nordan, a renowned radiologist who recently watched his colleagues killed by the Gatherer on an expedition.  — Jennifer Hart, a World News Network correspondent trying to get an interview with Nordan. The duo end up discovering the Seekers and the imminent threat posed by the Gatherer.  Lee said there would be many more players in the stories. “It’s a multi-character series, which introduces new characters while keeping the old ones in virtually every episode.”  What separates this comic from anything Lee has done before is that he’s giving an aspiring artist and comic book writer the chance to become a central part of the development of “The Seekers”.  Beginning in early August, MTV Geek will host a contest allowing anyone to send in their own interpretation of “The Seekers”. Artists will submit five pieces of art, while writers will turn in a 10-page script based on Lee’s treatment.  Lee and his team will pick 20 entries and the online community will vote for the top five submissions. Lee will announce the winners at New York Comic-Con in October and work directly with the artist and writer to create the comic.  “This contest is a big one and it’s important because we’re excited to give undiscovered talent a chance to shine,” he said.  “The comic book industry is expanding with digital comics and motion comics and video games. I think the opportunities are there for new talent, and this project is one way for people to get a job in the industry.”  “The Seekers” will join other digital comics that will run on MTV Geek, including Teen Wolf, Divination, The Gloom, Hats, Agent Mom, Me2, Punks, Hell Town, Beowulf Jones, and 1,000.  Tom Akel, executive editor of MTV Geek, said the website has attracted over 800,000 unique visitors since its mid-October launch last year. He expects the partnership with Lee to attract an even larger crowd.

40,DIS,UPDATE 1-'Captain America' shoots down 'Harry Potter'," * ‘Captain America’ $66 mln puts it No. 1 in U.S., Canada   * ‘Harry Potter’ finale drops 72 pct from record debut   * Global sales for ‘Deathly Hallows-Pt. 2” top $834 mln   * Romantic comedy ‘Friends with Benefits’ takes third  (Adds details on top domestic films, international sales)   By Lisa Richwine   LOS ANGELES, July 24 (Reuters) - Superhero movie “Captain America: The First Avenger” triumphed at the U.S. and Canadian box offices with $65.8 million in weekend ticket sales as the magic faded from the final “Harry Potter” film’s record-breaking debut.   The strong opening for “Captain America” topped expectations in its battle against the hugely successful “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,” which saw its massive opening-weekend audience from last week shrink by 72 percent.   The final installment in the popular “Potter” series took in $48.1 million over its second weekend in domestic (U.S. and Canadian) theaters, plus $121.3 million internationally, distributor Warner Bros. said on Sunday.   Romantic comedy “Friends with Benefits” starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, took the No. 3 spot over three days with $18.5 million domestically, a solid start for a film that cost about $34 million to produce, according to Sony Pictures studio.   “Captain America” drew a 64 percent male audience to the film set in the 1940s, about a scrawny, bullied orphan transformed into a muscular superhero thanks to a serum developed by the government. He is the latest Marvel comic book character to hit the big screen before the superheroes join forces in next year’s film “The Avengers.”   The success against the “Harry Potter” finale “was well beyond what anybody was expecting,” said Don Harris, executive vice president of distribution for Paramount Pictures, which released “Captain America.” The film drew positive reviews and “had a retro look to it” that appealed to moviegoers even after a summer filled with superhero flicks, he said.   For the eighth and final “Harry Potter” movie in the series about a British boy wizard battling against evil, sales dropped sharply, as expected, after avid fans had rushed to see the movie when it debuted. The film broke records around the world including best opening weekend ever in the domestic and international markets.   The film’s total ticket sales now stand at $274.2 million in domestic theaters and $560.4 million internationally, for a combined total of $834.6 million.   Other top films for the weekend were big-budget Hollywood film “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” at No. 4 with $12 million, and adult-oriented comedy “Horrible Bosses” at No. 5 with $11.7 million.   “Captain America” and “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” were released by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom Inc VIAb.N. Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), distributed “Deathly Hallows - Part 2” and “Horrible Bosses.” “Friends with Benefits” is from Screen Gems, a unit of Sony Corp (6758.T).

43,DIS,Reid's debt plan could speed wireless auctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Efforts to give U.S. regulators the authority to auction off some television airwaves for mobile broadband use are getting a boost in a debt ceiling plan proposed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  The auctions have the potential to raise $15 billion in revenue, according to Reid’s plan, with some of the proceeds going to broadcasters as compensation.  The Federal Communications Commission has been pushing for the authority to hold such auctions as a part of its broader National Broadband Plan. The FCC wants to repurpose 120 megahertz of spectrum currently used by TV broadcasters to free up more airwaves for rapidly growing wireless services.  The final shape of a plan to cut government spending in an effort to gain Republican support for raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion borrowing limit is very uncertain.  Lawmakers are still far apart over competing plans in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to raise the debt ceiling before August 2, when the U.S. Treasury says the government will start to run out of money to pay its bills.  The debt package proposed by House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, does not include spectrum auctions, multiple industry sources said.  But the inclusion by Reid, a Democrat, of the auction revenues could speed a spectrum reshuffle if it were to become part of the final plan.  Some 25 million Americans already watch video on smartphones and tablet computers like Apple Inc’s iPad, putting 120 times more demand on spectrum than older mobile phones.  “This deficit-reducing proposal reflects insight from members of the FCC, leading economists and wireless technology experts, all of whom have cautioned a spectrum crunch is looming,” said Jonathan Spalter, chairman of Mobile Future, a coalition whose membership includes technology and communications companies.  But broadcasters have expressed concerns over the unintended consequences repurposing their spectrum could have on their TV signals and the 46 million viewers that still rely on over-the-air TV.  Broadcasters worry that the FCC’s plan would affect not only those who voluntarily part with their spectrum, but the entire industry. The FCC would “repack,” or move TV stations, to make large swaths of spectrum considered more suited for mobile broadband use available.  A study released by the National Association of Broadcasters on Monday found that 40 percent of U.S. full power local television stations could have to vacate their current TV channel assignment.  “NAB is deeply concerned about provisions currently in Senate Majority Leader Reid’s legislation that would threaten the future of a great American institution — free and local television. We will work with him as the process moves forward in hopes that our issues can be addressed,” said Dennis Wharton, NAB’s executive vice president of communications.

The delisting will be at a price not exceeding 1,000 Indian rupees ($22.5) a share, UTV Software said, representing a maximum premium of 11 percent to the stock’s close on Monday.  Shares of Indian media company soared as much as 18 percent to 1,065 rupees, their highest in about three and a half years.  Entertainment conglomerate Walt Disney holds about 50.4 percent of the current paid-up equity share capital of the company.  The other major shareholders, who include the company’s Chief Executive Ronnie Screwvala, hold about 19.8 percent, which Walt Disney plans to buy after delisting at the same offer price.  “Walt Disney has always been interested in most of UTV’s business, especially the gaming part,” said a local analyst, who did not wish to be named, as he is not allowed to speak to the media. The deal will help the firm diversify and expand its presence in India, the analyst said.  UTV Software, which began as a television content company in 1990, now operates five segments — broadcasting, games, motion pictures, digital content and television content. The company has been aggressively growing its gaming segment over the past two years.  The company, which listed on the Mumbai bourses in 2005, had reported consolidated revenue of 9.47 billion rupees and a profit of 1.38 billion rupees in the fiscal year 2011 that ended March.

47,DIS,Reid's debt plan could speed wireless auctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Efforts to give U.S. regulators the authority to auction off some television airwaves for mobile broadband use are getting a boost in a debt ceiling plan proposed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  The auctions have the potential to raise $15 billion in revenue, according to Reid’s plan, with some of the proceeds going to broadcasters as compensation.  The Federal Communications Commission has been pushing for the authority to hold such auctions as a part of its broader National Broadband Plan. The FCC wants to repurpose 120 megahertz of spectrum currently used by TV broadcasters to free up more airwaves for rapidly growing wireless services.  The final shape of a plan to cut government spending in an effort to gain Republican support for raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion borrowing limit is very uncertain.  Lawmakers are still far apart over competing plans in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to raise the debt ceiling before August 2, when the U.S. Treasury says the government will start to run out of money to pay its bills.  The debt package proposed by House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, does not include spectrum auctions, multiple industry sources said.  But the inclusion by Reid, a Democrat, of the auction revenues could speed a spectrum reshuffle if it were to become part of the final plan.  Some 25 million Americans already watch video on smartphones and tablet computers like Apple Inc’s iPad, putting 120 times more demand on spectrum than older mobile phones.  “This deficit-reducing proposal reflects insight from members of the FCC, leading economists and wireless technology experts, all of whom have cautioned a spectrum crunch is looming,” said Jonathan Spalter, chairman of Mobile Future, a coalition whose membership includes technology and communications companies.  But broadcasters have expressed concerns over the unintended consequences repurposing their spectrum could have on their TV signals and the 46 million viewers that still rely on over-the-air TV.  Broadcasters worry that the FCC’s plan would affect not only those who voluntarily part with their spectrum, but the entire industry. The FCC would “repack,” or move TV stations, to make large swaths of spectrum considered more suited for mobile broadband use available.  A study released by the National Association of Broadcasters on Monday found that 40 percent of U.S. full power local television stations could have to vacate their current TV channel assignment.  “NAB is deeply concerned about provisions currently in Senate Majority Leader Reid’s legislation that would threaten the future of a great American institution — free and local television. We will work with him as the process moves forward in hopes that our issues can be addressed,” said Dennis Wharton, NAB’s executive vice president of communications.

48,DIS,Hollywood wins UK piracy victory against BT,"LONDON (Reuters) - Major Hollywood studios won a test case against Britain’s largest internet provider in the High Court on Thursday in their fight against online piracy, the Press Association reported.  The judge said he would impose an order to restrict BT customers’ access to a site that aggregates pirated material following the legal action taken by the Motion Picture Association of America.  The victory for studios including Paramount Pictures and Disney Enterprises is believed to be the first case in the UK in which an internet provider has been forced to block access to a website under the 1988 Copyright, Design and Patents Act.  “I will make an order substantially in the form sought by the studios,” Mr Justice Arnold said.  The piracy website Newzbin2 has around 700,000 members who pay to download content from the site, which appears to have a large UK base, asking members to pay in pounds sterling.  Around 70 percent of the content available on Newzbin2 is television programs and films.  “Today’s result is an important victory in the battle against a commercial pirate site which refused to operate within the law,” said Lord Puttnam, president of the Film Distributors’ Association.  Simon Milner, director of group industry policy at BT told Reuters the company thinks the ruling is “helpful” and is not going to appeal against the decision.  He said that following the judgment, BT must now look at how the operation to cut off access to the Newzbin2 website would function but could not provide details of this immediately.  Milner added that more ,similar cases could follow after the order is imposed on BT.  BT said in a statement: “This is a helpful judgment, which provides clarity on this complex issue. It clearly shows that rights holders need to prove their claims and convince a judge to make a court order.”  The company added that it will return to court after the summer to explain what kind of order it believes will be appropriate.  Chris Marcich, president and managing director of the Motion Picture Association (EMEA) said: “This court action was never an attack on ISPs but we do need their cooperation to deal with the Newzbin site which continually tries to evade the law and judicial sanction.”  ",7282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-bt-piracy/hollywood-wins-uk-piracy-victory-against-bt-idUSTRE76R1XK20110728

The totals are estimates of ticket sales from United States and Canadian theaters for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The leader will not be known until actual sales are tallied on Monday.  Going into the weekend, “Cowboys & Aliens” was seen easily topping box-office charts with starpower from James Bond actor Daniel Craig and “Indiana Jones” star Harrison Ford, plus director Jon Favreau from the hit “Iron Man” series and Steven Spielberg among the producers. The film is set in the Wild West in 1873, when a spaceship arrives in Arizona and runs into a posse of cowboys.  The movie offered “a fresh and unique concept,” said Nikki Rocco, president of distribution for Universal Pictures, a division of Comcast Corp that released the film. “It was a bet worth taking with these filmmakers.”  A lower-than-expected total for “Cowboys & Aliens” collided with a bigger draw from “The Smurfs,” a movie that revived characters that debuted more than 50 years ago.  “In the summer, family films are a hot commodity,” Paul Dergarabedian, box office analyst with Hollywood.com, said of the “Smurfs” success.  Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Columbia Pictures, said the “Smurfs” film “performed beyond our expectations.” Columbia Pictures is the unit of Sony Corp that released the movie.

62,DIS,NBC looks to rebuild quality TV shows under Comcast,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - NBC’s new entertainment chairman said on Monday that new owners Comcast Corp were serious about investing in the struggling TV network, and would be patient about seeing results as it tries to regain its former glory.  Former Showtime chief Robert Greenblatt, who is now NBC’s top programing executive, said he plans to develop original, quality TV shows that appeal to upscale viewers whom advertisers covet.  He also announced plans to reestablish Universal Media Studios — the network’s TV production arm — as a stand-alone entity after it was folded into the NBC network three years ago. He appointed veteran CBS network and cable television executive Bela Bajaria to head up that effort.  “The goals for this season and the next few years (are) to rebuild this schedule. We are going to be very aggressive. We are going to develop upscale original shows,” Greenblatt told reporters at a bi-annual meeting of television critics.  NBC has announced six new dramas and six new comedies for new TV season which starts in September in a bid to reverse its position at the bottom of the four leading U.S. networks.  Greenblatt was hired to lead that charge after cable operator Comcast acquired a controlling stake in NBC in January from General Electric Co..  Asked about the network’s direction under Comcast, Greenblatt said the cable giant had a “genuine excitement in these businesses” compared to a sense under General Electric that network TV was a declining business.  Comcast, Greenblatt said, has “a real enthusiasm for broadcast television and a desire to take this venerable American institution and raise it back up.”  He added that so far Comcast had shown “a desire to invest and be patient about what the bottom line is going to look like for a few years.”  NBC has struggled to find winning scripted shows to take the place of 1990s comedy hits like “Friends”, “Cheers” and “Seinfeld”.  Greenblatt said NBC had signed a development deal with “King of the Hill” and “The Office” creator Greg Daniels for new animated, live action and reality shows and has scheduled a new comedy block on Wednesday evenings.  “Comedy is a giant for us. We have got to have more of it,” he said.  Other new NBC shows include the controversial drama “The Playboy Club” set in the legendary 1960s nightclub, and a remake of the award-winning British crime drama “Prime Suspect” with Maria Bello.

63,DIS,PREVIEW-Big media rings up sales as advertisers keep coming,"   * Results due from CBS, Time Warner, Disney in next 2 weeks   * Revenue for big media seen up 4-7 pct   * Comcast revenue forecast to jump 45 pct post-NBC deal   * Advertising rebound expected to carry on   By Lisa Richwine   LOS ANGELES, Aug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. media giants are set to report quarterly revenue gains on the back of a booming advertising market that shows little sign of retreating.   Thanks largely to the strongest advertising spending in years, investors have flocked to media stocks, which have far outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX this year. Among the big gainers, CBS Corp (CBS.N) is up 44 percent, Viacom Inc VIAb.N is up 22 percent and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) has climbed 9 percent.   Industry analysts and investors see more healthy quarters ahead despite questions surrounding the overall U.S. economy.   “There is some uncertainty out there in terms of the macroenvironment, but we’re not hearing it from the management teams that we speak to,” said John Miller, a portfolio manager at Ariel Investments, which holds shares of CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Viacom Inc VIAb.N.   As for spending by advertisers, he said, “We don’t see a slowdown.”   Advertising typically accounts for 30 to 70 percent of sales for major players such as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CBS and Time Warner — companies that report quarterly results over the next two weeks.   Projected revenue increases vary by company, with CBS set to gain 7 percent, Time Warner 7 percent and Disney 4.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   After plunging with the economy in 2008, ad money is now flowing to broadcast and cable television networks as well as digital platforms such as social media and online video, said Brad Adgate, an analyst at advertising firm Horizon Media.   The new spending is driven partly by strong sales for autos and new technology such as tablet computers, plus optimism that the economy is improving and consumer spending will rise, he said.   Rate increases seen in this year’s upfronts — the television ad sales completed months before the fall season — ranked among the strongest in eight years, Adgate said. Big spenders in the market include automakers and communications providers. That should help boost the media giants.   “One of the bright spots (in the economy) has been the advertising marketplace. Earnings reports have been very strong for these media companies. I would suspect that would continue,” he said.   The Standard & Poor’s media index .GSPME has gained 10 percent in 2011, outpacing a 2.75 percent rise in the broader S&P 500.   Weak output and high unemployment have raised doubts about the U.S. economy’s recovery from recession. A slowdown could cause marketers to pull back their spending over fears consumers will tighten their wallets.   At the moment, media-watchers remain optimistic that TV advertising will hold strong in the coming quarters with a boost from spending on political ads heading in to next year’s presidential election.   “So far there are no signs of moderation as we start the second half of the year despite hints of the economy softening somewhat. You would need to see a more material change to interrupt” that trend, said Fred Moran, an analyst at The Benchmark Company.   Beyond advertising, investors will look to see how much CBS and others are gaining from licensing deals with companies like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to stream TV shows and movies over the Internet.   Those tie-ups are a new source of revenue for content providers as viewing habits shift from traditional television to mobile devices and Internet-connected TVs. “There’s really no cost to that. It pretty much drops to the bottom line,” Miller said.   For the just-completed quarter, analysts expect Disney to post earnings of 73 cents a share on revenue of $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. CBS is expected to earn 45 cents a share on revenue of $3.6 billion.   Cable operator Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), which now holds a controlling interest in NBC Universal, is expected to earn 41 cents a share with revenue of $13.8 billion, a 45 percent gain.   Time Warner and Viacom are projected to earn 56 cents a share and 85 cents a share, respectively.

64,DIS,Chinese retailers hijack the Ikea experience,"KUNMING, China (Reuters) - Nestled in a sleepy southern district of Kunming city in southwest China, is a 10,000 square meter, four-story building that could make Swedish furniture giant Ikea uneasy.  11 Furniture, as the store is known, copies Ikea’s blue and yellow color scheme, mock-up rooms, miniature pencils, signage and even its rocking chair designs. Its cafeteria-style restaurant, complete with minimalist wooden tables, has a familiar look, although the menu features Chinese-style braised minced pork and eggs instead of Ikea’s Swedish meatballs and salmon.  This knock-off Ikea store is emblematic of a new wave of piracy sweeping through China. Increasingly sophisticated counterfeiters no longer just pump out fake luxury handbags, DVDs and sports shoes but replicate the look, feel and service of successful Western retail concepts — in essence, pirating the entire brand experience.  “This is a new phenomenon,” said Adam Xu, retail analyst with Booz&Co. “Typically there are a lot of fake products, now we see more fakes in the service aspect in terms of (faking) the retail formats.”  Brands are much more than a logo on a handbag or some half-eaten pipfruit on a computer.  Many of the most successful consumer companies have invested millions in promoting and building brands which encapsulate ideals, values and aspirations, creating valuable and loyal customer bases that sometimes border on cults.  Last month, an American blogger set off a media storm after she posted pictures of an elaborate fake Apple Store in Kunming, selling genuine if unauthorized iPhones, Macbooks and other widely popular Apple products.  The presence of the fake stores in Kunming highlights China’s seemingly insatiable appetite for western brands in some consumer segments that have not been tapped, particularly in smaller cities far from the affluent eastern seaboard.  “What these fake stores indicate is that there is demand for the types of products and concepts that these brands sell,” said Hong Kong-based Torsten Stocker, a China retail analyst with Monitor Group.  The problem for companies that have been faked is that even if the fake stores sell genuine products, the brands have no control over how customers experience their brands.  Zhang Yunping, 22, a customer service representative at 11 Furniture, is used to the questions about Ikea.  “If two people are wearing the same clothes, you are bound to say that one copied the other,” Zhang said, shrugging her shoulders.  “Customers have told me we look like Ikea. But for me that’s not my problem. I just look after customers’ welfare. Things like copyrights, that is for the big bosses to manage,” she said.  11 Furniture’s owner could not be reached for comment.  Ikea said it has teams working at both the country and global level to handle intellectual property protection issues.  “Ikea as one of the biggest home furnishing companies in the world, protecting Ikea’s intellectual property rights is crucial,” Ikea China said in a statement to Reuters.  At 11 Furniture — its Chinese name “Shi Yi Jia Ju” sounds very much like Ikea’s Chinese name “Yi Jia Jia Ju” — furniture is made to order, not flat-packed as it is at Ikea.  Customers also notice other differences.  Ikea has nine stores in China, most of them in the wealthier coastal and southern cities. Xiao Lee, a Kunming resident who was shopping at 11 Furniture for a bedroom wardrobe with her husband, had visited Ikea stores in Beijing and Shanghai.  “I thought of shipping their products from the real Ikea store by cargo, but I thought that would be too troublesome so I came here,” Lee said.  “At the real Ikea, the layout is much neater and the decorations are laid out properly, you really can’t compare them,” she said.  Sometimes telling the difference between fake and real is not so easy.  “My favorite character is Mickey Mouse,” said Ling Xiao, a six year-old girl walking out of a Disney Store along Kunming’s popular pedestrian-only shopping street Zhengyi Road.  Ling Xiao and her mother shop at the Disney store about once a month and they have been going there for the past few years to browse for Mickey Mouse handbags and accessories.  “It should be real; it has been here a long time. I prefer coming to this store because it sells a big variety of toys,” said Ling Xiao’s mother, who declined to be named. Apart from Disney products, the store sells poorly made Angry Bird soft toys of dubious origin.  A Walt Disney spokeswoman said there are over 6,000 points of sale for Disney branded goods in China. Disney confirmed the store is legitimate, declining to elaborate further.  Outside a Nike store on the same retail strip, Han Zhimei, a 17 year-old student, looks longingly at a “Help Wanted” sign posted in the store’s window.  “I feel their stores have a spirit of teamwork and I really like the Nike brand,” said Han, who sports a trendy asymmetrical haircut. Han stopped by to apply for a job at Nike.  When asked how she knows the store is a legitimate reseller and that the goods are real, she pauses before answering.  “Well, it’s a Nike store, so the things in there should be real. I think people will be honest about these things and we should have brand loyalty,” Han said.  On Zhengyi Road alone, there are four Nike stores, all claiming to be legitimate. A check with Nike’s store locator brought up three stores in that street, meaning at least one is fake.  A Nike NIKE.N spokesman said the issue of unlicensed stores was part of the broader challenge of combating counterfeiting in China.  “We take the protection of our brand very seriously and have a variety of protocols in place,” a Nike spokesman said.  The jumble of real and fake stores in lower tier cities across China makes it hard for companies such as Apple, Disney, Nike and more so Ikea, which are closely identified with their outlets, to exert control over their brand image.  Companies such as Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) have long battled copycats in China, but the shift to imitations of the likes of Ikea presents a new set of challenges.  “The store is a key element of the brand, so faking it, in particular in a way that consumers don’t recognize as a fake, is impacting the brand image and reputation,” said Stocker.  Apple, which had its brand valued at more than $150 billion earlier this year, declined to comment.  For those setting up the fake, unauthorized or pirated goods stores, the attraction is obvious.  “We don’t need to advertise, everyone has heard of Disney,” said Dong, a 23-year-old store supervisor at a Walt Disney retail store a stone’s throw from where Ling Xiao and her mother were shopping.  That brand recognition has far outstripped the ability of companies to expand fast enough to tap demand exploding in inland China.  Sportswear brands such as Nike, Adidas and Li Ning, which have been in China for many years, are the leading fashion choice for those residing in less wealthy cities like Kunming, said a Boston Consulting Group report last month.  As the world’s second-largest economy races forward, the number of middle-class affluent households is expected to hit 130 million by 2020 from 50 million in 2010, BCG said.  These factors are fueling the race for brands like Nike and Adidas to open stores in less wealthy Chinese cities. Ikea has said it will open an average of one to two stores a year in China.  “Many foreign brands are already aware of the importance of lower tier cities but they are trying to figure out a way to go to market in these cities,” said Xu of Booz&Co.  In some cases, beating them to the punch are the Chinese pirates who, once established, may be hard for foreign companies to get shut.  Chinese law prohibits firms from copying the “look and feel” of other companies’ stores, but foreign companies must register their trademarks with China and enforcement is often spotty.  The United States and other Western countries have often complained China is woefully behind in its effort to stamp out intellectual property (IP) theft.  “Foreign companies often expect the Chinese government to handle their enforcement for them and though they sometimes will, they also sometimes will not,” said Dan Harris, a lawyer with Harris & Moure and co-author of China Law Blog.  “The problems often arise from the fact that the damages are often quite low and the Chinese courts do not have a lot of power to make sure their own judgments are enforced,” Harris said.  Back at 11 Furniture, it is apparent that copying Ikea’s ideas may not be enough to win over all consumers.  Examining cushion covers at 11 Furniture, Ms. Zhang, a woman in her fifties, sniffs derisively.  “The designs don’t look like typical Chinese designs. It’s not what everyday Chinese people would use,” Zhang said, pointing to a checkered cushion cover.  “It looks too fancy.”  ",8012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-brand-piracy/chinese-retailers-hijack-the-ikea-experience-idUSTRE77017720110801
65,DIS,"Big media's profits defy gloomy outlook, for now","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big media companies reported strong results but a bleak economic outlook has investors worried over whether they can deliver again in the face of high unemployment and slumping U.S. consumer spending.  Comcast Corp, Time Warner Inc and CBS Corp beat Wall Street forecasts because of a mix of content licensing deals, movie box office receipts and advertising growth.  Now, the chief concern among investors is whether earnings over the remainder of the year will hold up. And that largely depends on insurance companies, retailers, restaurants and phone companies continuing to spend on big advertising campaigns.  “We don’t see any signs of a deceleration right now,” said Steve Burke, chief executive of Comcast-controlled NBC Universal. “We are obviously concerned about the economy the way you would expect us to be; but so far the advertising market continues to be strong.”  Shares of Time Warner, parent of CNN, HBO and Warner Bros, closed 1.3 percent lower at $33.57 on Wednesday, with investors seemingly indifferent to the marginal increase in its forecast for the year.  Comcast shares ended little changed, while CBS, which issued results late on Tuesday, rose 1.6 percent. Viacom Inc, Walt Disney Co and News Corp have yet to report results.  NBC Universal saw advertising sales at its cable networks rise by 10 percent, while ad sales at its NBC broadcast network rose by 7 percent.  ""Advertising got so badly hit in 2008 and 2009 during the recession that advertising still has room to return to a normalized level to GDP,"" said Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould.

Time Warner’s ad sales rose 9 percent at its cable networks, but rose only 2 percent at its magazine unit. CBS’s ad sales rose 3 percent across TV, radio and outdoors.  “Given the weak economy, it raises concerns for ... the future of the advertising market. For now, ad markets remain healthy with a note of caution,” said Chris Marangi, portfolio manager at Gabelli Multimedia Funds, which owns media stocks including Comcast and Time Warner.  “Most media companies are in a better place to weather an ad decline than they were in 2008,” he said.  Comcast also must contend with customers canceling cable service because of lost jobs or lost homes, or because they went with cheaper Web video services like Netflix Inc.  Comcast lost 238,000 basic video customers in the quarter, but added 144,000 Internet and 193,000 phone subscribers. Its chief cable rival, Time Warner Cable lost 128,000 video customers during the quarter.  Comcast’s customer numbers “were pretty good, though basic video losses remains a concern for investors,” said Collins Stewart analyst Thomas Eagan. “We’re close to the broader pay-TV market being flat to down this quarter due to seasonality and the economy.”  The company cable customer additions fell in May, but recovered in June, said Comcast Cable President Neil Smit.

67,DIS,Hulu follows Netflix down original content path,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hulu, the popular TV show website, is trying its hand at commissioning its own shows at a time when its programing partners are starting to trim back the availability of content.  The online video site said on Wednesday it will be airing a six-episode half-hour documentary series called ‘A Day in the Life’ produced by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock this summer.  Spurlock, best known for his food industry documentary ‘Super Size Me’ centers the series around a complete day in the lives of well known people including entrepreneur Richard Branson.  The announcement comes just months after leading online video service Netflix Inc commissioned a 26-part TV series called “House of Cards” staring Kevin Spacey.  TV companies and studios have started to worry they will harm their lucrative multibillion dollar programing relationship with cable and satellite companies if newer popular shows are available for free or cheaply on video sites like Hulu and Netflix.  Last month, News Corp’s Fox Television said that from August 15 only online viewers who have been verified as pay-TV subscribers will be able to view Fox shows like “Glee” and “Bones” for eight days after the shows first air on TV.  Hulu, Fox.com and Dishonline.com will be among the first to participate but the Fox initiative will likely mean some Hulu users, who are used to watching shows the day after they air on TV, will now have to wait longer to view the latest shows. Hulu insiders expect other programmers to experiment with different models of making content available on its free website.  Hulu’s relationship with programmers is unique as it is owned by its primary programmers including News Corp, Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and Providence Equity Partners.  The relationships may become further complicated because Hulu is currently up for sale with companies including Yahoo Inc and Google Inc reported to be interested.  Hulu executive Andy Forssell told Reuters the company will consider making more original shows but sees the Spurlock partnership initially as an experiment.  “We’re talking to a couple of other producers, and there are things in the pipeline, but our priority is thinking in terms of what our audience wants rather than thinking in terms of genres or filling viewer hours,” he said.

69,DIS,Blu-ray sales up as home entertainment spend drops,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. sales of Blu-ray movie and television discs rose this year as overall spending on home entertainment dropped and viewing habits shifted, new figures from an industry group showed.  Rentals through subscription plans and kiosks also gained sharply while consumers again turned away from traditional video stores, according to a report released on Friday by DEG: The Digital Entertainment Group.  Total consumer dollars spent on home entertainment products — including DVDs, video on demand and online streaming — fell 5 percent to $8.3 billion in the first half of 2011. Industry executives pointed to a weaker movie line-up compared with a year earlier when the blockbuster “Avatar” was released.  Sales for Blu-ray and DVD discs combined in the first half of this year fell 18 percent to $3.9 billion, driven by a decline for traditional DVDs, compared with the same period a year ago.  But Blu-ray on its own gained 10 percent, the industry group said. It did not release dollar figures for Blu-ray and traditional DVD separately.  Blu-ray’s high-quality picture appealed to viewers as more homes added Blu-ray players, industry officials said.  “It’s getting very well-established in households. Consumers are getting more and more comfortable with buying Blu-ray,” said Ron Sanders, president of Warner Home Video and head of the industry group.  Homes with Blu-ray capable devices rose by 2 million in the second quarter to 31.6 million as prices for many players fell below $100. Blu-ray discs, digital sales and video-on-demand are higher-margin products for studios that all grew this year, DEG said.  At the same time, subscription rentals through mail and online streaming services such as Netflix Inc jumped 46 percent and brick-and-mortar stores dropped 28 percent. Rentals from kiosks, mainly Coinstar Inc’s Redbox, rose 40 percent.  While streaming options have grown, spending on subscription plans reached less than half of Blu-ray and DVD sales, hitting $1.6 billion, in the first half of the year. Kiosk sales were $805 million.  Weaker theater performance for films released for home viewing likely drove the overall spending drop, Sanders said. Box-office receipts for new releases ranked 16 percent lower than a year earlier. “Avatar,” the all-time box-office leader, sold more than 12 million discs in the second quarter of 2010 alone.  The recession also hit home-entertainment sales in recent years, Sanders said.  Broken down by quarter, spending slid 6.4 percent in the first quarter and 3.6 percent in the second quarter. That showed “a stabilization and improvement in the market,” said Amy Jo Smith, DEG’s executive director.  The second half should benefit from a handful of blockbuster movies set for release including “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2” and “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,” officials said.

71,DIS,"""Charlie's Angels"" find solid ground in TV remake","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - If you thought “Charlie’s Angels” were just kick-ass female superheroes, think again.  “Charlie’s Angels” are storming back to U.S. television in September in a high-stakes remake of the classic 1970s series that producers say will bring the crime-fighting trio back down to earth.  “We know a show like this has a big target on its back,” creator and executive producer Al Gough said on Sunday.  Gough said the two hit feature films based on the series, starring Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu, were “like superhero movies for girls.”  “We wanted to make this more grounded, make these women feel real, to give them a past. We wanted audiences to have something to come back to each week. The show is about redemption and second chances,” Gough told television reporters.  The iconic TV series, which aired from 1976 to 1981, made the late Farrah Fawcett an international sex symbol, and girl power found a new generation of fans in the 2000 and 2003 movies.  “Grey’s Anatomy” actress Rachael Taylor, Minka Kelly of “Friday Night Lights’ and Annie Ilonzeh, last seen on “General Hospital,” will take on the roles first made famous by Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson. Fawcett died in June 2009 of cancer.  ABC’s new series, premiering in September, switches the action to Miami. It will put more emphasis on the relationships among the three Angels and how they juggle their action-packed jobs and personal lives, as well as fleshing out their mysterious, never-seen boss, Charlie.  Actor Robert Wagner provided the voice of Charlie in the ABC pilot but has since dropped out because of what producers called “scheduling issues.” The program makers are still looking for a new Charlie, someone whose voice has the sufficient “mystery, paternalism and authority.”  Leonard Goldberg, producer of the original “Charlie’s Angels,, said the idea for a TV remake had come first from Sony Pictures.  “We did the movies and they were very successful. There was real enthusiasm from Sony and ABC to do this,” Goldberg said.

76,DIS,"ABC announces divorce from ""Desperate Housewives""","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - ABC on Sunday said it is ending “Desperate Housewives” when the current, eighth season wraps up in 2012, sending the popular ladies of Wisteria Lane packing into TV history.  ABC made the announcement to television critics, calling it an “iconic show” for the network.  “Desperate Housewives,” which stars Felicity Huffman, Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross and Eva Longoria among its ensemble cast, tells of the secretive lives and loves of women residing among the not-so-quiet confines of a suburban street, Wisteria Lane.  The show was hugely popular after it first began airing in 2004, winning numerous awards and gaining audiences overseas. But as with all TV shows, its popularity has waned as the show has aged.  Creator Marc Cherry said on Sunday he wanted the show to end on a high rather than limp along on for several more years.  “The only thing harder than creating a hit show is knowing when to end, especially when you have one of most amazing casts in the history of television,” Cherry told reporters.  “I am very aware of people overstaying their welcome ... I wanted to get out while the network still saw us as a viable show, while we were still a force to be contended with.”  Cherry said he had spoken with most of the cast about the decision, which he says was not entirely unexpected.  “I think you are going to find they are smart enough to just be grateful,” he said of the lead actresses’ reaction. For his own part, Cherry said, “I have nothing but gratitude.”  ABC entertainment president Paul Lee called the program “an iconic show.”  “We are desperately proud of it. I wanted to make sure that the show that got this network on the map had a victory lap,” Lee said at a gathering of TV critics in Los Angeles.  For this last season, ending in May 2012, ABC promises much intrigue for the main characters including guilty feelings about a murder and problems with disintegrating marriages, love affairs and sexy new neighbors.

81,DIS,Tim Allen searches for real men in return to TV,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tim Allen is headed back to television in his first network comedy in 12 years, feeling like the last real man in a woman’s world.  Or at least, that’s what his character Mike is experiencing in “Last Man Standing” — a family man surrounded by three headstrong daughters and a wife who has gone back to work, turning him into the stay at home dad.  The series, making its debut on ABC in October, turns Allen’s former alter ego, construction expert Tim Taylor in his hit 1990s comedy “Home Improvement” on its head. It is also one of a slew of upcoming TV comedies that feature emasculated or struggling men in a world where women appear to have the upper hand.  “What I really wanted was to flip flop ‘Home Improvement’ and investigate what it would be like to be around four women who are intelligent, strong fun and loving,” said Allen, whose “Home Improvement” comedy ran from 1991-99.  “Instead of tools (in ‘Home Improvement’) it is sporting goods and gun and ATVs and boats, and I come home to 4 women,” the actor and comedian told television reporters on Monday.  Allen plays a man working for an outdoor adventure firm, who lives in a world where younger, modern men — and women — are no longer able to do simple, once manly tasks like changing a car tire.  But it’s a situation that also strikes a chord with Allen, who has two daughters of his own, and admits he still prizes women who like to cook and take care of their men.  “I really believe men need stuff to do...You have to have hobbies,” the actor and comedian said.  “I like women who know how to cook, I like the process of letting a woman take care of you. It’s either old school or misogynistic...The men in my life like being able to take care of a home, and when men lose this capacity we are kind of left with nothing to do,” he said.  Creator Jack Burditt said that the struggling male theme would be just one aspect of “Last Man Standing”.  “It is an interesting topic. I am fascinated that for the first time in history more than 50 percent of the workplace are women, and 60 percent of college graduates are women.  “But that’s only one element of the show..At the heart of this is a family comedy about people who don’t always see eye to eye on everything but who really like each other...There are a lot of themes we will be tackling,” Burditt said.  “Last Man Standing” will join new TV shows “Man Up,” about three guys trying to figure out what it means to be a man in this modern world, and “Work It”, in which unemployed men dress up as women in order to get jobs.

84,DIS,"Analysis: ""Housewives"" heads to China as Hollywood inks deals","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Hollywood studios are set to break into China’s massive Internet market as domestic video sites scramble to screen U.S. movies and dramas on their digital platforms, a move which could also curb rampant piracy.  China’s Youku’s and Sohu’s online video platforms have already cut deals with Disney and CBS Corporation to stream U.S. drama serials such as “Desperate Housewives,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Gossip Girl,” and more such deals are expected.  This represents a lifeline for Hollywood studios who have struggled to make money in China due to persistent piracy and the country’s quota system that limits the number of foreign movies screened in theatres to 20 per year.  “Major Hollywood studios have struggled to find a viable business model in the China market and cooperating with China’s online video sites for paid viewing of their content finally gives them a way to make money here,” said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based consultancy Marbridge Consulting.  China is the world’s largest Internet market, with more than 450 million Internet users, and online video firms are stepping up their fight to secure a bigger piece of the market share to win advertisers.  Advertising revenue in the domestic online video market, which was virtually non-existent five years ago, is now estimated to be worth 1 billion yuan ($155 million). This is expected to grow at double-digit rate for the time being.  Online video providers such as Youku have also started pay-per-view for some movies, thus giving them a new source of revenue.  Analysts say it’s still too early to assess these deals’ financial impact on Hollywood studios over the longer term, but agree that this offers a long-awaited entry point for Disney and others to the world’s second biggest economy.  For online video providers, buying international content is not cheap, with payments for licensing fees needed upfront. But it’s well worth the risk given the rapid growth in the world’s biggest Internet market and growing appetite for Western movies.  Avatar, James Cameron’s blockbuster flick about an alien race, was the highest-grossing movie in China last year, raking in 540 million yuan in only 15 days. Although they form a small percentage of movies screened, Hollywood movies drew 44 percent of all 10 billion yuan in sales receipts in 2010.  Vincent Tao, chief executive of online video site China PPLive that has a deal with News Corp’s Fox Network, said Hollywood studios are now finding an avenue to expand into China though the regulatory landscape is still tricky.  “We want to introduce a lot of (Hollywood) movie content and of course we need to get permits but the online permits are much more flexible than the theater quotas,” Tao said.  Youku, China’s largest-listed online video player, launched its Premium Channel in June, after signing a deal with Warner Bros Entertainment’s local joint venture to offer pay per view movies.  Under the three-year deal, Youku will add 400 to 450 Warner Bros movies to its line-up. The deal is the second major Hollywood deal Youku has signed in less than a year. Last September, Youku bought 259 episodes from Disney.  Analysts forecast Youku to break even next year after an expected loss of $17 million loss this year.  Warner Bros, Youku and Disney all declined to comment on the financial size of the deals. Buying broadcast rights for a Hollywood series with 20 episodes costs about $300,000, according to a Reuters calculation based on available industry data.  Youku is contracted to buy at least another 259 television serial episodes this year from Disney with an announcement likely to come in September, a source familiar with the matter said.  “We see many positive signs for the relationship to develop,” said Jean Shao, a spokeswoman for Youku and declined comment on the contracts.  In China, which has long been under fire from Western countries for widespread violation of intellectual property rights, it is often difficult to find legitimate Hollywood DVDs or CDs in shops.  According to the latest research by Motion Picture Association of America, China had a piracy rate of 90 percent causing a total revenue loss $244 million on its member companies in 2005.  The Motion Picture Association consists of the six major film studios Disney, Paramount Pictures Corporation, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Universal City Studios and Warner Bros.  The latest move by online video sites to offer some Hollywood movies for free to its customers will help stamp out off-kilter videos and pirated DVDs and CDs from the streets.  “It’s a significant win in terms of respect for IP (intellectual property),” said Michael Clendenin, managing director at technology consultancy RedTech Advisors.  “The key competitive edge for online video service providers is to expand their video library, thus spending heavily on movie and TV content,” Muzhi Li, a Hong-Kong based analyst for Mizuho Securities said in a note.  The country’s biggest search engine Baidu has also ventured into this sector. Its Qiyi joint-venture with Providence Equity Partners has cut deals with Disney to show all seasons of Desperate Housewives, Cougar Town and Grey’s Anatomy.  It also signed a music deal with record labels, ending lawsuits between all parties.

Investors had expected a strong performance after rivals like Time Warner Inc outperformed, and Disney delivered with growth at its ESPN sports network and other cable channels.  But worries about the economy and a global markets selloff are spurring fears that consumers will curb trips to movie theaters and theme parks, or that advertisers will pull back after a recent spending binge as corporate budgets tighten.  “If there was any economic weakness, the parks business would be the most vulnerable to that. As of now, they haven’t seen any weakness,” said Morningstar analyst Michael Corty.  Disney shares were down 1.7 percent at $34.10 in after-hours trade, giving up part of a 5 percent gain during the regular session where it closed at $34.70.  Its movie studio — headed since late 2009 by fresh-faced wunderkind Rich Ross, credited for the monster franchises Hannah Montana and High School Musical — also disappointed despite a blockbuster smash with the fourth “Pirates of the Caribbean” film and the superhero flick “Thor.”  Studio entertainment operating income plummeted 60 percent to $49 million.  The Parks and Resorts group, which includes Disneyland parks and is closely tied to consumer spending, jumped 12 percent to $3.2 billion in the period. But the results were aided by the new “Disney Dream” cruise ship.  “The parks will continue to improve financially,” said Gabelli & Co analyst Brett Harriss. “It remains to be seen if recent volatility will impact consumer behavior.”  Rival media companies had already reported strong results for the quarter. Comcast Corp, Time Warner Inc and CBS Corp beat Wall Street forecasts.  The Media Networks arm, which incorporates sports channel ESPN and the ABC TV network, posted a better-than-expected 5 percent gain in fiscal third-quarter revenue to $4.95 billion.  ESPN “came in better than people had feared. They ended up with just a good, solid quarter,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Barton Crockett, who said that its theme parks business was holding up well.  “People are coming back to Disney vacations and that’s good for these guys.”  The operator of the ESPN and ABC networks, a movie studio and theme parks, reported fiscal third-quarter revenue of $10.68 billion, better than $10.5 billion expected.  But Disney’s movie studio and ABC network remain challenged despite a management overhaul instituted by CEO Bob Iger at those divisions over the last two years.  Fed up with underperformance, Iger in October 2009 replaced longtime studio boss Dick Cook and last year got rid of ABC Entertainment head Stephen McPherson and ABC News chief David Westin. All three were replaced by executives from the cable ranks, a testament to that unit’s ascendancy.  Studio honcho Ross has been unable to replicate his small-screen success on the big screen. Hits such as “Toy Story 3” and “Pirates of the Caribbean” emerged from Cook’s regime.  At ABC, which by itself posted a 1 percent dip in revenue to $1.4 billion but grew operating income 20 percent to $250 million, Iger last year named Paul Lee, formerly of ABC Family, to replace McPherson. Broadcast news veteran and Charlie St. Cloud author Ben Sherwood took Westin’s place.  Lee’s first official development slate, which will hit ABC’s schedule when the new fall season begins next month, didn’t go over well with critics, who complained the new crop of shows — among them a Charlie’s Angels reboot and the Mad Men-mimicking Pan Am — were too broad and uninspired.  On the news side, ABC has taken a beating in the press for paying license fees for access to photos and interviews with headline-makers like Representative Anthony Weiner’s texting partner Meagan Broussard, and most notably, Casey Anthony. The pay-for-play accusations resurfaced last month after ABC landed an exclusive with Nafissatou Diallo, the maid who accused IMF ex-chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of rape. ABC News has denied paying for the Diallo interview, but Sherwood also declared the division would no longer pay for access to any story.  On Tuesday, Disney posted net income of $1.48 billion or 77 cents per share, versus $1.33 billion or 67 cents a year earlier. Excluding certain items, it earned 78 cents a share, better than the 73 cents per share expected on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the U.S. credit rating late Friday, removing the nation’s triple-A designation for the first time in history, sparked the decline and underlined fears a recession was inevitable given increasing signs of slowing growth and more turmoil in the euro zone.   According to a Reuters poll, the U.S. faces one-in-four odds of slipping back into recession, though the economic outlook is raising the likelihood of new Fed action.

92,DIS,"Disney rides resurgent ads, but economic clouds loom"," * Ad spending on cable channels expected to boost quarter   * Economic outlook may spook consumers on which Disney depends   * Weaker economy could slow theme park traffic   * Latest Pirates installment generated massive sales    By Lisa Richwine	   LOS ANGELES, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street investors may look past an advertising rebound and a strong box office for Walt Disney Co and instead zero in on the outlook for its sprawling theme park unit as economic uncertainty grips consumers.	   Disney, whose shares are down nearly 25 percent since a rare earnings miss for the fiscal second quarter, is expected to confirm trends established by Comcast Corp , Time Warner Inc and CBS Corp , which beat Wall Street forecasts with a mix of content licensing deals, movie box office receipts and strong ad growth. 	   Analysts predict the operator of TV networks ESPN and ABC, a movie studio, cruise line and theme parks on three continents, will report a rebound in results this quarter.	   The rebound will likely be due to a healthy advertising market that fueled growth at the ESPN sports network and other cable channels that make up a large chunk of the company’s business.	   “The trends (at the cable networks) have been strong. I’d expect that to continue,” Morningstar analyst Michael Corty said.	   But in view of S&P’s unprecedented downgrade of the long-term U.S. credit rating, investors may focus more on how a bleak economic outlook might spook the consumers on which Disney depends for everything from movie receipts to theme park spending and merchandise sales.	   “A weaker economy could slow theme park traffic (which is a key risk in our opinion),” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Drew Crum wrote in a note to clients.	   The just-ended quarter should get a lift from the heavy spring travel period around the Easter holiday plus the new Disney Dream cruise ship, analysts said. Investors will look for comments from executives about bookings for the coming quarters amid concerns about weak economic growth, high unemployment and the chance of another recession.	   Disney’s studio division, often a swing factor for results, generated massive international sales from the fourth “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie, but faces tough comparisons with “Toy Story 3” last year, Nomura Securities analyst Michael Nathanson said in a research note. Most of the company’s major movies for this year already have hit theaters.	   Disney is expected to report fiscal third quarter earnings of 73 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue is forecast to rise 4.5 percent from a year earlier to $10.5 billion.

93,DIS,Murdoch to face Wall Street on News Corp earnings call,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - News Corp is taking a risk in putting boss Rupert Murdoch, famous for his off-script comments, on the media conglomerate’s quarterly earnings call on Wednesday with succession questions sure to be asked.  Murdoch, 80, will be speaking to Wall Street for the first time since the phone hacking scandal in Britain, and the issue of succession planning at the global media empire is certain to be raised, according to people familiar with the company.  It will be Murdoch’s first appearance on an earnings conference call since last August, and Wall Street wants to know if he is any more willing to hand over the CEO reins to trusted lieutenant Chase Carey, currently deputy chairman.  The issue of succession has come to the fore since Murdoch, chairman and chief executive, appeared overwhelmed at a British parliamentary hearing last month on the hacking tactics of his now-closed News of the World paper.  At the heart of the issue is whether Murdoch’s son and heir apparent James has been too badly tainted by the scandal at the British tabloid, which ultimately reported to him as head of News Corp’s European businesses.  There are also questions about the veracity of the younger Murdoch’s testimony to British lawmakers, which may yet do his reputation and succession hopes more harm.  “There is an understanding internally with senior management that the succession question has become an issue,” said a person familiar with internal discussions ahead of a News Corp board meeting on Tuesday.  Larry Haverty of Gabelli Multimedia Funds — who owns 195,000 Class A shares and 40,000 Class B shares of News Corp — said the company would benefit from “ring-fencing this scandal.”  Rupert Murdoch is expected to acknowledge some of the recent troubles in his prepared remarks, but he will not issue a new ‘mea culpa’ like the one he gave to the British parliament, according to the person familiar with the planning. The source was not permitted to talk publicly on the matter.  The conference call will take place after a board meeting on Tuesday in Los Angeles.  Collins Stewart analyst Thomas Eagan said investors he spoke with were very focused on succession questions.  “It would be helpful for him to lay out a strategy and we need to hear more about Chase Carey,” Eagan said. “Could they break up the chairman and chief executive roles?”  Carey, the News Corp chief operating officer, is respected by investors and analysts as a skilled operator who keeps the company running as the senior Murdoch focuses on pet projects.  The quarterly results themselves are expected to be solid, boosted by the performance of News Corp’s U.S. cable and broadcast television networks.  Analysts, on average, forecast quarterly profit of 29 cents a share, versus 33 cents a year ago, on revenue growth of 4.3 percent to $8.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company will likely try to focus Wednesday’s conference call on its financials, but it is unlikely to ever get away from the scandal even as its British newspaper unit is responsible for less than 5 percent of operating profits.  Murdoch is known for making off-the-cuff comments, such as when he told analysts that News Corp intended to make the website of the Wall Street Journal free. He made the comments before a full business analysis, which ultimately concluded that WSJ.com should remain a paid site.  “If Murdoch’s on the call, it will help more than it will hurt,” said Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Tuna Amobi. “He can speak with the best authority on the succession plan.”  Since the controversy, News Corp’s corporate governance has been put under a microscope — particularly its board, which has been criticized for being too cozy with the Murdochs.  Under the leadership of independent director Viet Dinh, the board has tried to change the perception that it is crammed with family members and corporate insiders. On Friday, Dinh announced that Murdoch’s daughter Elizabeth would not be joining the board as had previously been planned.  Some analysts expect the board to authorize another increase in News Corp’s dividend, following the July 12 lifting of its share buyback program to $5 billion.  “I think the board will likely be more proactive than they have been in asking for additional capital allocation, possibly an increase in dividend yield, which is currently just 1 percent. Time Warner Inc is around 3 percent while Walt Disney Co is around 1.14 percent,” said Collins Stewart’s Eagan.

[ID:nN1E76C17K]   The quarterly results themselves are expected to be solid, boosted by the performance of News Corp’s U.S. cable and broadcast television networks.   Analysts, on average, forecast quarterly profit of 29 cents a share, versus 33 cents a year ago, on revenue growth of 4.3 percent to $8.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   The company will likely try to focus Wednesday’s conference call on its financials, but it is unlikely to ever get away from the scandal even as its British newspaper unit is responsible for less than 5 percent of operating profits.   Murdoch is known for making off-the-cuff comments, such as when he told analysts that News Corp intended to make the website of the Wall Street Journal free. He made the comments before a full business analysis, which ultimately concluded that WSJ.com should remain a paid site.   “If Murdoch’s on the call, it will help more than it will hurt,” said Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Tuna Amobi. “He can speak with the best authority on the succession plan.”   Since the controversy, News Corp’s corporate governance has been put under a microscope — particularly its board, which has been criticized for being too cozy with the Murdochs.   Under the leadership of independent director Viet Dinh, the board has tried to change the perception that it is crammed with family members and corporate insiders. On Friday, Dinh announced that Murdoch’s daughter Elizabeth would not be joining the board as had previously been planned.   Some analysts expect the board to authorize another increase in News Corp’s dividend, following the July 12 lifting of its share buyback program to $5 billion.   “I think the board will likely be more proactive than they have been in asking for additional capital allocation, possibly an increase in dividend yield, which is currently just 1 percent. Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) is around 3 percent while Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is around 1.14 percent,” said Collins Stewart’s Eagan.

95,DIS,Banks drag Wall Street lower as fear returns,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fear returned to Wall Street on Wednesday, sending the S&P 500 to another 4 percent decline, triggered by worries that Europe’s debt crisis could engulf French banks and spill onto the U.S. financial sector.  Trading was once again marked by sharp moves on heavy volume. For a fifth straight day, the Dow industrials fluctuated in a range of more than 400 points.  “What you’re seeing is a very short-term, direction-oriented market,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago.  Worries about the strength of French lenders, including Societe Generale, triggered a selloff in European and U.S. banks. Rumors about SocGen’s financial health, which the bank denied, sent its shares tumbling 14.7 percent.  An index of European banks dropped 6.7 percent and the KBW index of U.S. bank stocks slid 4.9 percent as fear grew of a possible contagion of any French crisis. Bank of America Corp lost 10.9 percent to $6.77 and Goldman Sachs slid more than 10 percent to $110.34.  The Dow Jones industrial average lost 519.83 points, or 4.62 percent, to 10,719.94. The S&P 500 fell 51.77 points, or 4.42 percent, to 1,120.76. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.47 points, or 4.09 percent, to 2,381.05.  Wednesday’s drop came a day after stocks rallied on the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates near zero for at least two more years.  Even after Tuesday’s snap-back rally, the S&P 500 is down almost 18 percent from its 2011 closing high set April 29.  The losses came against the backdrop of recent weak U.S. economic data, the United States losing its triple-A credit rating from Standard & Poor’s and the inability of lawmakers to address worries that another recession may be on the way.  About 15.1 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, almost double the year’s estimated daily average of 7.8 billion.  Volume once again spiked in the last hour of trading, and the market closed near its session lows. Of late, overleveraged investors with losses on their books have been forced to sell shares near the end of the day.  “Between 3 and 3:20 (p.m.) you have people getting margin calls, and on days like today there’s some nervousness about what those calls will look like,” said Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York, referring to the volatility of the final hour of trading.  Slides in the value of stocks may increase the cash needed in margin accounts, which can spark further selling.  Dow component Walt Disney Co dropped 9.1 percent to $31.54 a day after the entertainment company’s quarterly results failed to reassure investors that it could do well in a weak U.S. economy.

97,DIS,"Disney magic fades, economy fears wallop shares","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shares of Walt Disney Co were hammered on Wednesday as Wall Street worried how the company’s steady-growth media and resort businesses would fare if consumers get pinched in a weak economy.  Disney shares closed 9.1 percent lower at $31.54 after falling nearly 15 percent earlier in the session, one day after quarterly results failed to inspire investors already nervous about theme park revenue and the sustainability of an advertising rebound.  Several brokerages lowered expectations after the results, which followed a rare earnings miss in the previous quarter. Barclays Capital, Wunderlich Securities, RBC and Evercore Partners all cut their price targets and lowered forecasts for those core divisions.  “Given an uncertain consumer, we are taking a more conservative stance on our estimates going forward,” including lowering estimates for ESPN advertising revenue, said Barclays Capital analyst Anthony DiClemente. He lowered his price target for Disney shares to $44 from $52.  The company’s shares fell much more than those of rivals like Time Warner Inc, which dropped 4.6 percent. Disney lost some $6 billion in market value even after the shares recouped some of their losses in afternoon trading. They still finished with a considerably sharper drop than the 4.4 percent fall in the broader S&P 500.  The operator of theme parks, the ESPN sports and ABC broadcast networks and a movie studio is known for consistently beating analysts’ expectations. But the company had reported a miss when it released fiscal second-quarter results in May.  In fiscal third-quarter results reported on Tuesday, the Mouse House beat most analysts’ expectations. But that came after it recorded $228 million in ESPN revenue that was expected in the fourth quarter, nearly 5 percent of the $4.9 billion in total revenue for the company’s media networks.  Disney “has not lived up to the earnings-beatings behavior it is known for,” Nomura Securities analyst Michael Nathanson said in a note to clients. He lowered his price target on the shares to $42 from $45.  Disney executives told analysts the company is not seeing any advertiser downturn at its TV networks, and hotel bookings were down 2 percent less than the company had forecast.  But they also warned about higher programing and production costs at ESPN, lower syndication sales at ABC and tough year-over-year comparisons for its studio division in the fourth quarter.  Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan lowered his rating on Disney to “hold” from “buy,” saying the company’s asset value appeared “excessively ... oriented toward ESPN.”  “Disney has major upside off better monetization of Disney Pixar, Marvel, ABC, and the parks, but this hinges on creative execution and the economy,” Harrigan said in a note to clients.  RBC Capital Markets analyst David Bank, who cut his price target to $43 from $48, said ESPN ad growth and margins at theme parks were “softer than expected” in the just-ended quarter.  “While years of execution justify ‘best of breed’ premium valuation, we think several quarters of ‘misses’ could make it somewhat vulnerable,” Bank said in a research note.

102,DIS,Century bonds resurface as yields dive,"NEW YORK, Aug 10 (IFR) - Century bonds, the symptom of extremely low rates and extremely deprived investors, are making a comeback — if only for today.  With US Treasury yields throughout the curve trading at or near all-time lows borrowers — and investors — are taking advantage of the cheap money in a big way.  Two issuers were in the market with 100-year bonds on Wednesday. University of Southern California has completed a US$300m offering of century bonds, and Mexico was out to reopen and double the size of the 100-year security it priced in October last year.  Both deals priced without a sizeable spread difference from typical 30-year money. Investors were generally happy to take on the longer maturity in exchange for more yield in a relatively safe credit.  The issuers saw plenty of evidence that this was the week to take home cheap capital. The roiling equity markets notwithstanding, the debt capital markets have been stable and amenable to new issuance.  The two-year Treasury note changed hands this afternoon at 0.188%, down 9.2bp from the close last Friday, several hours before S&P announced its one-notch downgrade of the US sovereign.  Over the same period, five-year notes have lost 25.9bp, and out on the curve, the 10-year and the 30-year have lost 39.1bp and 24.3bp, respectively.  Mexico’s original US$1bn 5.75% bond last year, its debut in the maturity, was already the largest century debt on record, and today they hit the market for another US$1bn. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs launched the deal at 96.5. They priced the bonds to yield 5.959%, or 241.8bp over 30-year Treasuries.  Though some questioned the logic of Mexico pricing a 100-year bond last year, the 5.75% coupon it achieved at the time was tighter than on its existing bonds due 2040, which pay out 6.05%.  USC, for its part, has never priced a century bond, though universities have been some of the most active in the space in the US. This afternoon Aa1/AA rated USC took home US$300m in 100-year money.  The trade priced at par with a 5.25% coupon to yield 174bp over the 4.75% Treasury bond due 2041. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley led the trade. The proceeds will be used to support the university’s capital plans and/or to refinance existing debt.  The last university to price a century bond was the Triple A rated Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, on May 11 2011. That US$750m offering, also the subject of low yields, printed with a 5.60% coupon to yield 130bp over the 30-year Treasury bond. This morning MIT bonds were quoted at 115bp/105bp.  The most recent 100-year trade, however, came from Norfolk Southern, a Baa1/BBB+/BBB rated transportation company. On May 18 this year it upsized an US$250m tranche to US$400m, through Morgan Stanley, and priced it with a 6.00% coupon at par. It printed at a 175.2bp premium to 4.75% 30-year bonds due February 2041.  Indeed, Norfolk has been one of the more active borrowers in the tenor over the past decade, but it has had company. Disney was the first issuer ever to print a 100-year bond, when it priced a US$300m fundraising on July 21 1993.  A day later, Coca-Cola, still one of the most favored issuers in the high-grade space, priced a US$150m deal.  Since then, the list of issuers is relatively long, including Yale University, Union Pacific, IBM, Chrysler and Caterpillar.  But deal pace fell off quickly after May 1998 when Coke returned for a US$250m trade. Since then there have been nine deals, including today’s trade.

105,DIS,Fund manager charged as Marvel insider trader,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Securities regulators have charged a California man with insider trading for buying speculative call options on Marvel Entertainment after learning that Walt Disney Co planned to acquire the comic-book superhero company.  Toby Scammell, 26, is alleged to have bought Marvel call options in August 2009 after learning about the planned acquisition from his girlfriend of two years, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint filed in a California federal court.  Scammell’s girlfriend worked on the Marvel acquisition as a six-month temporary employee in Disney’s corporate strategy department and knew the details about the pricing and timing of the deal, the SEC said.  Scammell secretly used the money in his older brother’s accounts, which he had gained control over when his brother was deployed with the U.S. Army to Iraq in 2007, the agency said.  Just before he bought the Marvel options, Scammell searched the Internet for terms like “insider trading” and “material, non-public information,” the SEC complaint said.  Scammell did not reveal his trades or profits to his brother or his girlfriend, the SEC said.  The SEC said the investigation was continuing.  Miles Ehrlich, an attorney for Scammell, said that after nearly 18 months of investigation — where the SEC spoke to every possible witness, scrutinized every document, and analyzed every email, every text, every instant message, and every website Toby visited — the SEC still cannot identify a day, a time, a place, a conversation, a document, or anything bearing even a passing resemblance to proof as to how Toby supposedly learned the inside information.  SCAMMELL BOUGHT CALL OPTIONS -SEC  “Scammell exploited his romantic relationship for a financial windfall. His misuse of confidential information gave him an unfair and illegal edge over other traders in the markets,” said Rosalind Tyson, the director of the SEC’s Los Angeles Regional Office.  In the weeks before announcement of the deal, the SEC said Scammell bought call options with strike prices of $50 and $45 — something the agency said was “highly remarkable” because the stock price had never closed above $41.74 and the options were set to expire in a few weeks.  He later sold the options for a profit of more than $192,000, or a 3,000 percent return, in less than a month, the SEC said.  The agency noted he had never traded in Marvel before and only had one other “very unsuccessful” prior experience trading call options. The SEC said he worked at the time for an investment fund, although the complaint does not identify the name of his former employer.  The SEC complaint said Scammell now lives in Greenbrae, California.  A Disney spokeswoman said on Thursday that “this does not involve Disney and the complaint speaks for itself.”  ",8112011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-disney/fund-manager-charged-as-marvel-insider-trader-idUSTRE77A6AN20110811

107,DIS,Google and Facebook face-off in social games,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook is not the only game in town anymore.  The world’s largest Internet social network moved on Thursday to shore up support with game developers such as Zynga, who provide one of Facebook’s biggest draws, on the same day that Google Inc introduced games on its recently-launched social network.  With the two Web giants competing to attract users to their respective online services, the dueling social gaming announcements underscored what could emerge as a key battleground between the two companies.  “It turns out that people like to play games, and it’s core to the social networking use case,” said Jeremy Liew, a partner at venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners. Liew, who has invested in social game companies including Playdom, which was acquired by the Walt Disney Co last year, was commenting on Google’s games announcement.  On Thursday, Google said it would offer 16 games from third party developers on Google+, including Zynga Poker and the popular Angry Birds game. Google, which previously made an unspecified investment in Zynga, said it will roll out games gradually on Google+, and will make the game feature available to everyone “soon.”  Facebook, which is hosting 100 game developers at an event at its Palo Alto. California headquarters on Thursday evening, announced a handful of new features to improve the gaming experience on its website, as well as a new policy loosening restrictions on how developers can market their games on the social network.  The changes will expand the types of notifications that Facebook users see when their friends are playing games on the website, rolling back restrictions made last year that provoked grumbles among some game developers.  Social games, such as Zynga’s Farmville, are some of the most popular activities on Facebook. More than 200 million users play games on Facebook every month, and the company takes a 30 percent cut of the sale of virtual goods that are bought by users as part of the game experience.  “Our games ecosystem has continued to grow. But there’s no question that we want to grow it faster in a more high quality way for our users and developers,” Facebook head of games Sean Ryan told Reuters in an interview.  Google launched its social networking site in June, signing up more than 10 million users in the first two weeks.  Google’s move to offer games on its social network provides game developers with a compelling alternative to Facebook, said Lightspeed’s Liew.  But he said the most important consideration for game makers is which social network has the most users.  “Right now no one is going to be willing to give up Facebook because it’s where the users are Today. Google+ got a terrific start but it’s got a ways to go,” he said.  Among the new gaming features introduced by Facebook on Thursday are the ability to expand the size of the window in which games are played on Facebook’s site, new ways for users to create bookmarks for their favorite games and a scrolling “ticker” that highlights the games a person’s friends are playing, their recent scores and achievements.  In loosening restrictions on game updates within Facebook’s general newsfeed, the company must walk a fine line between helping developers promote their games on the network and irking users that are not avid gamers.  Facebook’s newsfeed - which displays a rolling stream of messages, photos and updates from friends - is a vital distribution channel for gamemakers, allowing companies like Zynga, Electronic Arts Inc’s Playfish and Playdom to reach vast numbers of users. But is has caused some backlash among Facebook’s non-gaming users, who found the constant notifications about their friends progress within various games to be irrelevant and annoying.  Last year, Facebook clamped down on the practice, so that Facebook users would receive notifications only about games which they had also installed. Under the new policy, Facebook users will see notifications about any game their friends are playing.  But Ryan said the company had developed special algorithms that will only display updates if Facebook has a reason to believe they are relevant to the person. If the person shows no interest in certain types of games, Facebook won’t serve them updates in the newsfeed.  “No one wants to go back to the bad old days of people being very unhappy about gaming because they feel like they’re being spammed all the time,” said Ryan.  “That’s the key which we really spent months and months working on, is that tricky balance of trying to expose a lot more games to people, but only to the people who we think want to play those games.”  ",8122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-games/google-and-facebook-face-off-in-social-games-idUSTRE77A66H20110812

109,DIS,UPDATE 1-'Apes' hangs on to domestic box office lead," * ‘Apes’ takes second straight domestic box office win   * ‘The Help’ beats expectations with $25.5 million   * ‘Smurfs’ ring up strong overseas sales  (Adds quotes, details on film sales)   By Lisa Richwine   LOS ANGELES, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Nothing could stop angry apes from tearing through the domestic weekend box office as “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” took the lead with an estimated $27.5 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales plus $40.5 million internationally.   The revival of the classic sci-fi franchise beat four new releases to hang on to the top ranking at U.S. and Canadian theaters for the second straight week, according to studio estimates released on Sunday. Civil Rights-era drama “The Help” finished a strong second with $25.5 million over three days, beating studio forecasts.   The U.S. and Canadian audience for “Apes” shrunk 50 percent from its opening weekend. The drop was “a fantastic hold” against four new films that grossed a combined $60 million, said Chris Aronson, senior vice president for domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox, which distributed the movie. “Apes” brought in a total of $68 million globally for the weekend.   Strong reviews and a rare A+ rating from audience-survey firm CinemaScore propelled “The Help,” a film based on a best-selling book by Kathryn Stockett. The movie chronicles the lives of wealthy white women in Mississippi and their black housekeepers. It cost about $25 million to produce.   “The Help” appealed to broad audiences across the country and drew positive responses from men as well as the core audience of women, said Dave Hollis, executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution at Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), which distributed the DreamWorks-produced film.   “This is a most pleasant surprise,” Hollis said of the opening weekend sales. Disney expects to add another 100 to 200 additional theaters after the early success sparked more interest, he said. The film was showing in 2,534 theaters over the opening weekend after debuting on Wednesday. Over five days, the film grossed $35.4 million.   In third place for the weekend, horror flick and new release “Final Destination 5,” in which survivors of a bridge collapse try to cheat death, generated $18.4 million domestically. That hit the low end of studio forecasts.   Surprise summer hit “The Smurfs” took fourth place on the domestic charts with $13.5 million during its third weekend in theaters, plus an impressive $60 million haul in international markets for the live-action and animated family film.   Comedy “30 Minutes or Less,” starring Jesse Eisenberg, finished fifth with $13 million at the domestic box office. The movie tells the tale of two criminals who kidnap a pizza delivery boy, strap a bomb to his chest and order him to rob a bank. The production budget was $28 million.   The weekend’s other new release, “Glee: The 3D Concert Movie,” failed to crack the top 10 with $5.7 million domestically, making it No. 11 for the weekend. The film pairs song-and-dance performances from a “Glee” concert tour with commentary from fans of the hit television show about an Ohio high school’s show choir. The movie cost $9 million to make and is scheduled for just two weeks in theaters.   “Final Destination 5” was distributed by Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp (6758.T) (SNE.N), released “30 Minutes or Less” and “The Smurfs.”   “Planet of the Apes” and “Glee: the 3D Concert Movie” were released by 20th Century Fox, a unit of News Corp (NWSA.O).

112,DIS,Box office heading toward record despite economy,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A popular boy wizard, comic-book heroes and some foul-mouthed women are leading Hollywood toward a record-breaking summer despite the sour economy and high unemployment resulting in tightened consumer spending.  Underscoring the notion that movies are recession-proof, U.S. and Canadian ticket sales are expected to finish nearly 5 percent higher than a year ago thanks to the “Harry Potter” finale and other big-budget sequels plus raunchy adult comedies such as “Bridesmaids.”  Summer ticket sales in the domestic (U.S. and Canadian) market through last weekend stood at an estimated $3.8 billion. Attendance was up 2.8 percent, though that was compared with last year’s 13-year low, according to figures from tracking firm Hollywood.com. Premium charges for 3D films and slightly higher average ticket prices helped raise revenue.  “If we keep at this pace, we should wind up with $4.5 billion,” the highest summer total ever, said Paul Dergarabedian, box office analyst with Hollywood.com.  The summer film season — usually measured from early May through Labor Day weekend in September — represents the most lucrative time of the year for studios, providing as much as 40 percent of annual box-office dollars.  Still, year-to-date box office revenue is down 4 percent from 2010 while attendance has shrunk 5 percent after weak winter and spring ticket sales. Studios need a strong holiday season to regain lost ground at a time when the U.S. economy is sputtering.  “Overall I think people are feeling good” about the summer results, said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp that rang up big sales with family film “The Smurfs.”  The strong summer box office belies recent data on consumer spending from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which showed that Americans spent less and saved more money in June, just as the summer season was moving into full swing. It also goes against concerns among economists about the possibility of a double-dip recession brought on by high unemployment and anemic economic growth.  But moviegoing, which is one of the cheaper entertainment options for consumers, usually holds up in weak economies, industry players said. For instance, in summer 2008, the most recent comparable period to this summer in terms of the macro-economy, domestic box-office sales gained 0.5 percent year-over-year, though that was largely due to ticket price increases. Attendance actually fell 3.7 percent that summer.  Box-office success is tied more to the quality of the films than economic trends, Dergarabedian said. “Good movies are recession-proof,” he said.  Chris Aronson, senior vice president for domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox, added that “lower-quality 3D films could be under pressure as audiences become more discerning.” Overall box-office totals for 2011 “will probably get to a position where we are level with last year,” he said.  This summer’s standout performers thus far include “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,” which broke records worldwide and was among three movies to sell more than $1 billion globally. The others were the third “Transformers” and fourth “Pirates of the Caribbean.”  “The one consistent area of success is still in the big franchise and in the big sequel,” said Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom Inc.  Foul-mouthed women scored big with better-than-expected sales for “Bridesmaids” and “Bad Teacher.” Another adult comedy, “The Hangover 2,” also was a hit.  Superheroes abounded on screens — to mixed results. “Captain America: The First Avenger” and “Thor” performed well while “The Green Lantern” fizzled.  Four of the five highest-grossing summer 2011 films were offered in 3D, as were several other summer flicks. But filmgoers often decided to live with two dimensions, sparking a debate in the industry over whether the appetite for 3D movies had petered out.  “Avatar” director James Cameron recently urged Hollywood to make sure 3D movies provided a quality experience to justify the higher price.  “This is a good moment for Hollywood to acknowledge that they have to try harder to maintain the idea that 3D is a premium experience. We can’t take cheap routes,” Cameron told Reuters in an interview.  Walt Disney Co’s revered Pixar animation unit for the first time stumbled with critics who panned “Cars 2.” The film has proven resilient with audiences, however, surpassing the original’s box-office tally with more than $476 million in gross sales worldwide.  But the strong performance of sequels this summer has a downside.  “There really weren’t any new franchises created ... This summer may wind up with record gross (box office), but I don’t know if enough seeds were planted for the future,” said Brandon Gray, president of industry tracking firm boxofficemojo.com.  From that perspective, the rest of the year appears ominous for studios, with sequels to “Twilight,” “Mission Impossible,” “Happy Feet” and “Alvin and the Chipmunks” all set for release.

Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) revered Pixar animation unit for the first time stumbled with critics who panned “Cars 2.” The film has proven resilient with audiences, however, surpassing the original’s box-office tally with more than $476 million in gross sales worldwide.   But the strong performance of sequels this summer has a downside.   “There really weren’t any new franchises created ... This summer may wind up with record gross (box office), but I don’t know if enough seeds were planted for the future,” said Brandon Gray, president of industry tracking firm boxofficemojo.com.   From that perspective, the rest of the year appears ominous for studios, with sequels to “Twilight,” “Mission Impossible,” “Happy Feet” and “Alvin and the Chipmunks” all set for release.

115,DIS,IFR-Disney cleans up in US bond market with coupon records," NEW YORK, Aug 18 (IFR) - The Walt Disney Company hit the market with a bond offering on Wednesday and ended up achieving the lowest ever coupons for bonds with maturities of five, 10 and 30 years.   It’s a sign of the times. The market was ripe with possibility when the A2/A/A rated issuer went out to investors yesterday. Treasuries all week have been trading near all time lows. In fact, what has drawn Disney (DIS.N) and this week’s other issuers to market is not necessarily a strong need for cash. The main allure is the ultra-low rates, and credit spreads for top-notch credits have snapped tight.   “Credit spreads on highly coveted names like Walt Disney are back at or close to their tights of the year; we’ve hit new lows across the Treasury curve, new issue concessions have abated and there is a cash-rich investor base,” said Jonathan Fine, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate in the Americas at Goldman Sachs. “When you have a confluence of these events issuers are going to break some records.”   Disney printed a US$750m offering of five-year notes with a 1.35% coupon at 99.206 to yield Treasuries plus 60bp. The coupon bests the 1.375% record held by Colgate Palmolive Co (CL.N) since October 29 2010. The US$750m 10-year finished with a 2.75% coupon at 98.717 to yield plus 72bp, beating out the 2.95% coupon achieved by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on August 12 2010 and matched by Colgate on October 29 2010.   Meanwhile, Disney’s US$350m 30-year tranche printed with a 4.375% coupon at 99.01 to yield Treasuries plus 87.5bp. J&J also set the previous 30-year record of 4.50% on August 12 2010. A handful of other issuers tied that level soon thereafter, including Microsoft (MSFT.O), San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. Most recently Southwestern Public Service Co priced a 4.50% long bond on August 3 2011.   Disney was clearly what a lot of investors were looking for this week.   “You have to be able to check a number of boxes at the moment to get this type of execution in the new issue market: you need to be well known, Single-A or better and non-financial. If you are all of these things then you are ripe for a phenomenal offering,” said Fine.   Disney has always been at the forefront of financing trends. Most noticeably, it was the first corporate issuer ever to print a 100-year bond, when it priced a US$300m fundraising on July 21 1993. That started a trend among certain high-grade issuers that re-emerged over the past year, most recently with a US$300m century bond from University of Southern California that priced on August 10 2011.   Disney’s last trip the high-grade bond market was on May 18 this year. The difference between the Wednesday trade and the May deal had more to do with the changes in the Treasury market than in Disney.   The issuer printed a US$500m offering of 10-year notes in May with a 3.75% coupon, a full percentage point richer than Wednesday’s trade. However, from the point of view of spread it was a more attractive deal for the company. Last time it achieved 60bp over Treasuries compared to 72bp on Wednesday.

The films remain untitled and few details were unveiled. The dinosaur movie will tell a story that takes place “if the asteroid missed the Earth and dinosaurs continued to live,” said director Bob Peterson, who co-directed the previous Pixar release “Up.”   Peterson said he was inspired by animatronic dinosaurs he saw as a child during a visit to a world’s fair. The movie is set for release in 2013.   Another film, set to hit theaters in 2014, will take audiences inside the human mind and attempt to answer questions such as “why do songs get stuck in your head?” said director Pete Docter, who directed “Up” and Pixar’s “Monsters Inc.”   The filmmakers spoke to thousands of people gathered at the D23 Expo, a convention that draws Disney fans eager to learn about upcoming projects and hear from stars of the company’s films and television shows.   The new films will follow Pixar’s “Brave,” a fairy tale set in medieval Scotland that is due in theaters next summer, and “Monsters University,” a prequel to “Monsters Inc,” set for release in June 2013.

118,DIS,"""The Help"" outflexes ""Conan"" to win box office","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The maids of “The Help” proved far mightier than muscle-flexing “Conan the Barbarian” and three other new releases at the weekend box office, taking the top spot with an estimated $20.5 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales.  “The Help” rose from its second-place finish last week to the top spot with rave reviews and strong word-of-mouth buzz, distributor Walt Disney Co said on Sunday. The drama chronicles the relationships between white women in Mississippi and their black housekeepers in the 1960s.  The movie’s North American (U.S. and Canadian) receipts slipped 21 percent from its debut a week earlier, an impressive hold and more than enough to beat underwhelming performances from four new films. To date, “The Help” has beat expectations by ringing up a total of $71.8 million.  “We always hoped ‘The Help’ would be a breath of fresh air after a busy, sequel-filled, smash-‘em-up summer. The way the public’s embracing it indicates that is indeed the case,” said Dave Hollis, executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution at Disney.  Last weekend’s box-office leader, sci-fi movie “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” fell to second place with a projected $16.3 million domestically during its third weekend of release. Total North American sales now stand at $133.8 million for the latest take on the classic tale about genetically enhanced chimps that launch a revolution.  Of the new releases, “Spy Kids: All the Time in the World,” performed the best at No. 3 with $12 million, hitting the low end of forecasts. “Given the marketplace this weekend, I’m okay with that number,” said Erik Lomis, president of distribution for The Weinstein Co, which released the film.  The fourth “Spy Kids” movie was presented in “4D,” with scratch-and-sniff cards to add scents throughout, and was aimed at children ages 12 and younger. “It plays and it delivers to that audience,” Lomis said.  Two remakes of 1980s films — “Conan the Barbarian” and “Fright Night” — fell flat.  “Conan the Barbarian,” a reboot of the film that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger’s career, was the No. 4 movie for the weekend with $10 million, short of forecasts in the low- to-mid teens. Jason Momoa, seen recently in HBO series “Game of Thrones,” plays the lead role in the updated version.  “Overall, the weekend box office was disappointing” for new films, said David Spitz, head of domestic distribution for Lionsgate, which released “Conan the Barbarian.”  “Fright Night,” a remake of a popular 1985 horror film, finished fifth with $8.3 million, also below pre-release estimates. It stars Colin Farrell and Anton Yelchin and was targeted partly at young adults, an audience with “a finicky nature,” said Disney’s Hollis. Disney released “Fright Night” and “The Help,” two films produced by DreamWorks.  “One Day,” a new romance starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess, landed in the No.9 spot with $5.1 million at domestic theaters.

125,DIS,Analysis: Where does Jobs stand among America's iconic CEOs?,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The question is not whether Steve Jobs is an iconic CEO, but where Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) co-founder ranks in the pantheon of business leaders who have carved out a place in history.  Jobs would surely pass the Times Square test, meaning many people walking around the New York City tourist mecca would know who he is, while they might not recognize the names of other business legends such as General Electric’s (GE.N) former Chief Executive Jack Welch.  And Jobs’ technological innovations, among them the Mac computer, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, have brought him the same one-name recognition as Carnegie, Ford, Gates, Murdoch, and others.  But 50 years from now, will the Nano be considered as revolutionary as the Model T?  “What Ford did for the automobile — just look at the suburbs and highways that developed from him, the assembly lines. Ford had a tremendous effect,” said Mike Carrier, a professor at Rutgers School of Law in New Jersey, who has written extensively on innovation and intellectual property.  “I would put Jobs up in that category in terms of how he revolutionized our concept of music, of phones, of the computer, of literally everything.”  But others say the jury is still out on the lasting influence of Jobs’ creations, given the breakneck pace of technological innovations and the fickleness of consumers. Motorola’s (MMI.N) Razr, for example, was thought to be revolutionary just a few years ago.  “I’m not sure how all these innovations will stack up in the long-term,” said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School of Business.  When Jobs first started out more than three decades ago, there were some who thought he would not make it.  Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, associate dean of the Yale School of Management, remembers vividly how Jobs awkwardly introduced himself to Polaroid CEO Ed Land during a lunch at Michela’s in Cambridge, Massachusetts  in 1985.  “He came over to Ed to thank him for his wisdom in marrying progressive management with technological advancement,” Sonnenfeld said. “After he left, Ed shook his head and said, ‘That guy is never going to make it. He doesn’t get technology. He’s just a salesman.’”  Jobs is a salesman, one of the most successful of the last half century. But the magnitude of his technological brilliance — The New York Times pointed out that his name appears as inventor on 313 patents — and his penchant for theatrics place him on a historical spectrum somewhere between Thomas Edison and Walt Disney.  “There are few CEOs who can compare to Jobs in terms of breadth of activities, length of time in command, and connection with consumers,” said Harvard Business School professor Anita Elberse.  Part of Jobs’ mystique is owed to a confluence of factors either unique to him or to our times. The attention paid to CEOs by financial analysts and the media far exceeds what it was during Henry Ford’s day, for instance.  And Jobs’ career trajectory as a pioneer, failure, and comeback success has the narrative arc that journalists love. Walt Disney or William Randolph Hearst hit on one or two of those plot points, but not all three.  “You can’t underestimate the massive impact the press has had in building up the concept of the celebrity CEO,” said Eric Abrahamson, professor of management at Columbia Business School.  He pointed to the reinvention of Kimberly Clarke (KMB.N) as a case in point. That company began as a lumber manufacturer, then moved on to pulp before hitting it big with gas masks during World War I. After the war, Kimberly Clarke’s fortunes began a downward spiral and did not recover until the company introduced Kleenex.  Though that turnaround is akin to the one Jobs’ pulled off after returning to Apple in 1996 — its stock is up roughly 9,000 percent over that time — Abrahamson said, “I couldn’t tell you who the CEO was who led Kimberly Clarke’s turnaround.”  Jobs diverges from his peer group in two key aspects: the number of industries his company’s products have fundamentally changed and consumers’ identification of him as the singular force behind those products.  Ford helped create the automobile industry. Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Jobs designed aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-use devices that changed the way computing, music and movies were made and enjoyed.  By accident or design, consumers have made a visceral connection between Apple products and the guy in the blue jeans, black turtleneck, and wire-rimmed glasses. They know Jobs did not create the devices on his own, but they desperately want to believe that he did.  They have sprinkled some of Disney’s pixie dust on him, in a manner of speaking.  “Consumers personally believe that Jobs is solely responsible for the products in their house,” Elberse said. But they do not think that Murdoch alone puts out News Corp newspapers, for instance.  “Fifty or a hundred years from now they’ll look back on Apple products and think, ‘Steve Jobs made this,’” she said. “That’s his cultural impact.”  And his legacy.

126,DIS,"UPDATE 9-Steve Jobs quits as Apple CEO, Cook takes over"," * Jobs relinquishes CEO role to Cook, longtime No. 2   * Questions swirl over Jobs’ health. He becomes chairman   * Source says Jobs spent day at HQ, will stay active   * Shares dive 7 percent in after-hours trading  (recasts 30th paragraph on Jobs’ firing in 1985)   By Poornima Gupta and Edwin Chan   SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Steve Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Wednesday and passed the reins to his right-hand man Tim Cook, saying he could no longer fulfill the duties in a bombshell announcement that raised fears his health has deteriorated further.   Jobs, who fought and survived a rare form of pancreatic cancer and revolutionized the technology arena with the iPhone and the iPad in the past four years, is deemed the heart and soul of a company that this month briefly became the most valuable in America.   “I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come,” Jobs, who takes on the new position of chairman, said in a short letter announcing his resignation.   The letter and a separate terse, somewhat cryptic statement from Apple raised more questions than it answered about Jobs’ health and the future of the company.   While it’s unlikely that his departure as CEO will derail Apple’s ambitious product-launch roadmap in the near term, there are concerns about whether the company would stay a creative force to be reckoned with beyond the next year or so without its founder and visionary at the helm.   That is why Apple’s stock dropped as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading when Jobs’ departure was announced.   In the company statement, Apple co-lead director Art Levinson on behalf of the board praised Jobs’ “extraordinary vision and leadership” and “countless contributions to Apple’s success”, saying he would continue to serve the company with “unique insights, creativity and inspiration.”   However, the statement, which also talked about Cook’s outstanding performance, said nothing about Jobs’ health.   His battle with pancreatic cancer, which has stretched over several years, has been of deep concern to Apple fans, investors and the company’s board. Over the past two years, even board members have confided to friends their concern that Jobs, in his quest for privacy, wasn’t being forthcoming with directors about the true condition of his health.   Jobs has been on medical leave since Jan. 17, with his duties being filled by Cook, who was chief operating officer.   Jobs spent all Wednesday meeting with board members and top managers at Apple’s headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, and plans to remain active in his new role, a source close to Jobs told Reuters. A second source said Jobs will remain on the board of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).   Still, some industry insiders express concern that Jobs’ has clearly signaled he is too ill to keep up the punishing pace of a top executive job.   The 56-year-old Jobs had briefly emerged from medical leave in March to unveil the latest iPad and later attended a dinner hosted by President Barack Obama for technology leaders in Silicon Valley. But his often-gaunt appearance had sparked questions about how bad his illness was and his ability to continue at Apple.   In each of Jobs’ three health-related absences, Cook has taken over the helm. But the 50-year-old Alabama native, a former Compaq executive and an acknowledged master of supply-chain management, remains largely untested in Wall Street’s view. [ID:nN1E77N23J]   That’s partly why, despite Cook being viewed as a safe bet to run Apple’s sprawling empire, some still think his boss will be very badly missed. One Silicon Valley CEO, who declined to be identified because of the sensitive issues involved, said the tone of Jobs’ statement indicated his health might be worse than publicly known.   Jobs has earned a reputation for commanding every aspect of operations - from day-to-day running to broad strategic decisions - suggesting he would not have given up the job if he had a choice.   “It’s really sad,” the CEO told Reuters. “No one is looking at this as a business thing, but as a human thing. No one thinks that Steve is just stepping aside because he just doesn’t want to be CEO of Apple anymore.”   “It feels like another shoe is going to drop.”   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   TAKE A LOOK                                [ID:nN1E77N227]   NEWSMAKER-Cook’s vision at center stage    [ID:nN1E77N23J]   INSTANT VIEW                               [ID:nN1E77N21P]   GRAPHICS:                                                   Major product launches:     link.reuters.com/fet38r  Cook's impact at Apple:        r.reuters.com/vuq28r  BREAKINGVIEWS-Now investors can focus      [ID:nN1E77N26Q]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ",8252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/apple/update-9-steve-jobs-quits-as-apple-ceo-cook-takes-over-idUSN1E77O00220110825

129,DIS,Analysis: Where does Jobs stand among America's iconic CEOs?,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The question is not whether Steve Jobs is an iconic CEO, but where Apple Inc’s co-founder ranks in the pantheon of business leaders who have carved out a place in history.  Jobs would surely pass the Times Square test, meaning many people walking around the New York City tourist mecca would know who he is, while they might not recognize the names of other business legends such as General Electric’s former Chief Executive Jack Welch.  And Jobs’ technological innovations, among them the Mac computer, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, have brought him the same one-name recognition as Carnegie, Ford, Gates, Murdoch, and others.  But 50 years from now, will the Nano be considered as revolutionary as the Model T?  “What Ford did for the automobile — just look at the suburbs and highways that developed from him, the assembly lines. Ford had a tremendous effect,” said Mike Carrier, a professor at Rutgers School of Law in New Jersey, who has written extensively on innovation and intellectual property.  “I would put Jobs up in that category in terms of how he revolutionized our concept of music, of phones, of the computer, of literally everything.”  But others say the jury is still out on the lasting influence of Jobs’ creations, given the breakneck pace of technological innovations and the fickleness of consumers. Motorola’s Razr, for example, was thought to be revolutionary just a few years ago.  “I’m not sure how all these innovations will stack up in the long-term,” said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School of Business.  When Jobs first started out more than three decades ago, there were some who thought he would not make it.  Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, associate dean of the Yale School of Management, remembers vividly how Jobs awkwardly introduced himself to Polaroid CEO Ed Land during a lunch at Michela’s in Cambridge, Massachusetts  in 1985.  “He came over to Ed to thank him for his wisdom in marrying progressive management with technological advancement,” Sonnenfeld said. “After he left, Ed shook his head and said, ‘That guy is never going to make it. He doesn’t get technology. He’s just a salesman.’”  Jobs is a salesman, one of the most successful of the last half century. But the magnitude of his technological brilliance — The New York Times pointed out that his name appears as inventor on 313 patents — and his penchant for theatrics place him on a historical spectrum somewhere between Thomas Edison and Walt Disney.  “There are few CEOs who can compare to Jobs in terms of breadth of activities, length of time in command, and connection with consumers,” said Harvard Business School professor Anita Elberse.  Part of Jobs’ mystique is owed to a confluence of factors either unique to him or to our times. The attention paid to CEOs by financial analysts and the media far exceeds what it was during Henry Ford’s day, for instance.  And Jobs’ career trajectory as a pioneer, failure, and comeback success has the narrative arc that journalists love. Walt Disney or William Randolph Hearst hit on one or two of those plot points, but not all three.  “You can’t underestimate the massive impact the press has had in building up the concept of the celebrity CEO,” said Eric Abrahamson, professor of management at Columbia Business School.  He pointed to the reinvention of Kimberly Clarke as a case in point. That company began as a lumber manufacturer, then moved on to pulp before hitting it big with gas masks during World War I. After the war, Kimberly Clarke’s fortunes began a downward spiral and did not recover until the company introduced Kleenex.  Though that turnaround is akin to the one Jobs’ pulled off after returning to Apple in 1996 — its stock is up roughly 9,000 percent over that time — Abrahamson said, “I couldn’t tell you who the CEO was who led Kimberly Clarke’s turnaround.”  Jobs diverges from his peer group in two key aspects: the number of industries his company’s products have fundamentally changed and consumers’ identification of him as the singular force behind those products.  Ford helped create the automobile industry. Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Jobs designed aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-use devices that changed the way computing, music and movies were made and enjoyed.  By accident or design, consumers have made a visceral connection between Apple products and the guy in the blue jeans, black turtleneck, and wire-rimmed glasses. They know Jobs did not create the devices on his own, but they desperately want to believe that he did.  They have sprinkled some of Disney’s pixie dust on him, in a manner of speaking.  “Consumers personally believe that Jobs is solely responsible for the products in their house,” Elberse said. But they do not think that Murdoch alone puts out News Corp newspapers, for instance.  “Fifty or a hundred years from now they’ll look back on Apple products and think, ‘Steve Jobs made this,’” she said. “That’s his cultural impact.”  And his legacy.

130,DIS,Google chairman Schmidt to woo TV elite," * TV industry seeking clues to impact of Google’s Motorola deal   * Opportunity for Google to banish suspicion   * Speech to Edinburgh televsion festival at 1745 GMT   * To be broadcast live on YouTube    By Georgina Prodhan	   LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Google’s Eric Schmidt faces a wary audience of British television professionals on Friday following a major acquisition that could turn Google TV into a real competitor for TV advertising dollars.	   Google’s chairman will be the first person from outside the TV industry to give the Edinburgh television festival’s keynote MacTaggart lecture in its 35-year history.	   So far Google’s relations with the TV establishment have been rocky.	   “There is still a general wariness within the TV business, broadly understood, about what Google is there to do,” says analyst Dan Cryan of UK media research firm IHS Screen Digest.	   “The thing that really scares any TV company is the potential for Google coming into their space and selling ads to their customers.”	   Google has long held ambitions in the television arena, hoping to extend its online advertising business, which made $28 billion for the company last year, to the big screens that still command the lion’s share of global advertising budgets.	   So far, it has had little success, despite its ownership of the world’s most popular online video site, YouTube.	   Google TV, which allows viewers to get Web content on their television screens via a browser, was launched last October in the United States.	   It was quickly blocked by three of the top U.S. broadcasters — NBC , CBS and ABC — as well as online video site Hulu, which is backed by major media companies, and received poor reviews.	   In July, Logitech slashed the price of its Revue set-top boxes for Google TV to $99 from an initial $299.	   Last week, however, Google’s deal to buy Motorola Mobility  for $12.5 billion handed it the world’s leading set top box business which delivers content for many of the top cable TV companies in the United States.	   The headline attraction of the deal was Motorola’s huge portfolio of wireless patents but the set top box business and Motorola’s cellphone unit may give Google useful footholds to expand into new markets.	   Google has not spelled out its plans for the set top box business, and many analysts expect it to divest the unit at the first opportunity.	   But some, like New York-based Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey, say it may use the chance to gain insights into pay-TV.	   “Google describes itself as an opportunistic company. So while it may not have wanted to buy Motorola’s operations, it may now assess whether retaining these assets can compensate for the risk of owning them,” Jeffrey wrote in a note this week.	   The acquisition has raised the hackles of U.S. cable TV companies who will now be working with a partner with whom they have clashed on issues from rationing content delivery to piracy.  	   Back under the leadership of Larry Page — Google’s co-founder took the reins back from Schmidt in April — the company may be expected to make bold moves in areas like mobile and TV.	   Page has already launched a social network to compete with Facebook, Google+, which has picked up more than 25 million users since it started in June, promising valuable insights to help Google target advertising more accurately.	   A foothold in the living room via a set top box powered by Google’s mobile operating system, Android, could provide rich data on how online purchases are driven by TV ads.	   “The distance between an ad and the transaction is much smaller than before — before, you’d go out and buy it but now you can stay in and buy it,” says Paul Lee, author of a report on the television industry published this week by Deloitte.	   “The ability for television to drive ecommerce is greater than ever. But understanding how that happens is very important,” he says.	   Owning a set top box business may allow Google to reapproach the television industry in a different way from the flawed Google TV consumer product.   	   “It may not materialise in you seeing Google TV via a Motorola set-top box,” says Paul Erickson, analyst with Texas-based consumer-electronics research firm IMS research. “The overarching effects of this deal are going to be more subtle.”	   Erickson believes Google could even win over the television industry by offering a common developmennt platform, saving content providers and television manufacturers the trouble of making multiple versions of applications for Web-connected TVs.	   Schmidt, whose remit now includes reaching out to governments and other organisations, will need all his powers of persuasion to convince the Edinburgh audience that Google TV could be a partner, not a threat.

131,DIS,Google's Schmidt sees more partners for Google TV,"EDINBURGH, Scotland (Reuters) - Google is “absolutely committed” to its fledgling television business and expects many more partners to join it soon, Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said on Saturday.  Google TV, which allows viewers to mix Web and television content on TV screens via a browser, has received lukewarm reviews and been blocked by the major U.S. networks since its launch in the United States in October.  Schmidt told the Edinburgh television festival its lack of success so far was partly because it was a feature designed into televisions, devices which consumers tend to replace only about once every five years.  “We’re absolutely committed to staying, to improving Google TV,” he said, adding that new companies would be joining existing partners Sony and Logitech for the next version. Logitech makes computer mice, speakers, webcams and keyboards.  “I believe that they’re both going to be on board and I believe there are many more coming. Wait shortly for an announcement,” he said.  Google has long harbored ambitions to extend its $28 billion online advertising business to the television arena, where the lion’s share of global ad budgets is spent.  It owns YouTube, the world’s most popular online video site, but has not announced any profits from that business since buying it in 2006.  Schmidt said in a keynote speech on Friday that he expected Google TV to launch in Europe early next year.  On Saturday, he said Google had not yet resolved its differences with U.S. networks ABC, NBC and CBS, and hoped the company would not encounter similar problems for its British launch.  “We certainly have talked to them about reversing their position and we certainly hope that won’t happen here,” he said, adding that Google was in talks with UK broadcasters.  Like other industries disrupted by the Internet, the television industry is broadly suspicious of Google, fearing the company will steal its advertising revenues without contributing toward the high costs of programing.  Google argues that the Internet can expand the total advertising market by providing better-targeted and more effective ads that will encourage companies to spend more.  Google could glean valuable insights into U.S. viewing habits from the $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility, which it announced last week.  Motorola owns the world’s largest set top box business and has close relationships with U.S. cable companies — who have expressed concern about the acquisition.  Schmidt said he could not talk in detail about Google’s plans for that business until the merger was completed, but said there were “interesting ideas” about how it could help Google’s existing television business.  “We’re intending to run Motorola, which would include the set top box business, as a completely separate business. That does not mean that there won’t be communication between the two, and obviously sharing and knowledge sharing,” he said.  Schmidt also said British Prime Minister David Cameron would be making a mistake if he tried to shut down online communications during periods of social unrest.  Cameron had asked authorities to look at the possibility of such measures in the wake of riots that tore through England earlier this month and were partly organized on Research in Motion’s BlackBerry Messenger, Twitter and Facebook.  Such moves have been widely condemned as repressive when used by other countries, especially during the Arab Spring uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East.  “I think it’s a mistake. I hope that’s a clear answer,” Schmidt said. “Whatever the problem was, which I don’t really understand... the Internet was a reflection of that problem but turning the Internet on and off is not going to fix it.”  ",8272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-television/googles-schmidt-sees-more-partners-for-google-tv-idUSTRE77Q1OY20110827

Hurricane Irene forced the closure of theaters in big markets such as New York and kept moviegoers home along a broad stretch of the East Coast. Domestic ticket sales came in 23 percent lower than the same weekend a year earlier, according to figures from Hollywood.com.  “The Help,” a drama about black housekeepers in Civil Rights-era Mississippi, took the top spot in the North American (U.S. and Canadian) market for the second straight weekend. The DreamWorks-produced film adaptation of a best-selling novel by Kathryn Stockett has grossed $96.6 million since it opened three weeks ago, distributor Walt Disney Co said.  The bad weather did not help new releases on a late summer weekend that was expected to be slow even without a major storm.  Action movie “Columbiana” debuted in second place with an estimated $10.3 million, ahead of studio forecasts of around $8 million. The film features actress Zoe Saldana as a woman who witnesses her parents’ murder as a child in Bogota and grows up to be an assassin seeking revenge.  “The picture is off to a good start, storm or no storm,” said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp that released the film.  Horror movie “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” starring Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce, finished third with domestic sales of $8.7 million.  “Our key large urban East Coast markets were really killed” by the hurricane, said Bob Berney, president of theatrical distribution for FilmDistrict.

Sci-fi movie “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” finished fourth with $8.7 million, bringing its domestic total to $148.5 million over four weeks.

Action movie “Colombiana” finished second with $10.3 million while horror flick “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark” took third place with $8.7 million.   Box-office sales were pressured by Hurricane Irene, which forced the closure of theaters in big markets such as New York and kept moviegoers at home along a broad stretch of the East Coast.   TriStar Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp (6758.T), released “Colombiana.” “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark” was distributed by FilmDistrict.

138,DIS,"U.S. vote in 2012 will be record, $6 billion election","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Forget the struggling economy. There’s one U.S. industry — Big Politics — that is looking ahead to a record year in 2012.  The U.S. elections will be the most expensive ever, with a total price tag of $6 billion or even more, fueled by millions of dollars in unrestricted donations as Republicans and Democrats vie for control of the White House, Congress and state governments.  “It’s safe to say that, given that we had a $5 billion cycle in 2008, it will certainly be more than that and very likely over $6 billion, which is just an astonishing growth rate,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending.  The cost of the election is surprising given that only the Republican Party is holding presidential primaries, unlike in 2008 when both parties had expensive contests to find a candidate.  One reason it will be so costly this time around is the fundraising power of leading candidates, even with a sputtering economy and high unemployment. President Barack Obama is expected to at least match the record $760 million he raised to win the White House in 2008 and even hit $1 billion.  Obama’s Republican challenger will need a similar war chest to compete. Two of the Republican frontrunners, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and Texas Governor Rick Perry, are fundraising heavyweights.  A third Republican, Michele Bachmann, also can bring in the cash and was the House of Representatives’ best fundraiser in 2010.  Fundraising in congressional and local races is also mounting with 14 months to go before the November 6 elections. The money to be hauled in and spent in the overall 2012 campaign is equivalent to the GDP of a small country like Nicaragua.  The 2012 candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives reported raising $295.2 million in the first six months of 2011, the highest total ever reported for the first half of a non-election year.  Candidates will use the money to pay for staff and travel, but if previous campaigns are any measure they will spend about half on advertising. That is a bonanza for television and radio networks, especially in the hardest fought states and areas with competitive Senate and House races.  Analysts forecast perhaps billions of dollars in advertising spending, boosting revenues at a range of U.S. media companies. TV networks like CBS, Fox News, ABC, NBC and CNN will be the biggest benefactors.  But while presidential and congressional candidates cannot run a race without a big checkbook, neither party is seen as gaining a major advantage from the current spending splurge.  More money does not always mean victory, said Michael Malbin, executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute.  “You can point to election after election where a person spent more and spent more, and the more the voters heard of that person, the more that person went down in the polls,” Malbin said. “If the person is selling horse meat the people won’t eat it.”  The cost of U.S. elections has risen steadily but this will be the first presidential race since the landmark “Citizens United” 2010 Supreme Court ruling, which ended most restrictions on donations by corporations and unions.  It also fostered the creation of Super PACs, fundraising committees that can spend money to support a candidate but cannot officially coordinate with campaigns.  The Super PACs worry ethics watchdogs, who say the increased leverage of big donors is limiting the influence of average voters on politics.  In particular, the need to get big donations early in campaigns is keeping candidates with fewer donors from even running for office, particularly in congressional races. And the reign of big money in politics inevitably will give too much clout to big donors, activists say.  “Those who fund the candidates are the ones who get listened to,” said Meredith McGehee, policy director at the Campaign Legal Center, which works on campaign finance and government ethics. “And a Super PAC and others that can deliver millions of dollars, any supposed notion that they are not going to have a leg up is wrong. It’s not just a leg up, it’s going to be that the system runs for them.”  All of the leading Republican candidates have Super PACs.  A half dozen are backing Perry, who has rocketed to the top of polls in the Republican nomination race.  A Super PAC associated with Romney received $1 million from W Spann, a corporation that existed for four months and apparently engaged in no activity other than the donation. Edward Conard, a former executive of Romney’s old company, Bain Capital, came forward early this month and said he was behind W Spann, but said he did not intend to circumvent campaign finance law by creating the company.

140,DIS,Starz to pull content from Netflix as talks fail,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starz Entertainment will pull its movies and television shows from Netflix Inc’s streaming service early next year, depriving Netflix customers of online access to new releases from two major Hollywood studios.  Pay-TV operator Starz, controlled by John Malone’s Liberty Media, said on Thursday it had ended negotiations aimed at renewing a deal that expires February 28. After that date, Starz will stop providing its content, which includes exclusive rights to first-run Sony Corp and Walt Disney Co movies, for streaming on Netflix.  Netflix shares were down 8.7 percent at $213 in after-hours trade, from a close on the Nasdaq of $233.27.  The original online streaming rights are believed to have been agreed for around $30 million a year four years ago, people familiar with the deal have said. Many Wall Street analysts expected a new deal for around 10 times the cost of the original.  Starz, in a statement, called its decision “a result of our strategy to protect the premium nature of our brand by preserving the appropriate pricing and packaging” of its content.  The news came the same day that an unpopular Netflix price hike of as much as $6 per month took effect. The breakdown with Starz was a surprise because investors had expected the parties to reach a deal, said Brett Harriss, an analyst with Gabelli & Co.  “Netflix just effectively raised prices by 60 percent, and a big chunk of their content walked away,” Harriss said.  Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey said the company was “confident we can take the money we had earmarked for Starz renewal next year, and spend it with other content providers to maintain or even improve the Netflix experience.”  Starz is the exclusive distributor of first-run Sony and Disney movies on pay-TV in the United States under an agreement that allows it to distribute the programing wholesale on multiple platforms, including online streaming.  But Netflix — which has grown faster than partners expected — triggered a deal clause in the first quarter when it announced it now has more than 22.8 million subscribers in the United States, of which nearly two-thirds were streaming videos, sources told Reuters in June.  Under terms of the original contract, the trigger allowed Sony to ask Starz for better financial terms, the sources had said.

143,DIS,Mickey Mouse and Asterix escape French tax hike -- for now,"PARIS (Reuters) - Asterix the Gallic warrior and his big-eared American friend Mickey Mouse can breathe easier after lawmakers torpedoed French government plans to more than triple the tax on theme park entrance fees.  President Nicolas Sarkozy has ordered his government to find more money to help plug the hole in public finances but one of the proposals, a sales tax hike of 5.5 to 19.6 percent on entry ticket sales to approximately 200 theme parks in France, was rejected by a key committee in the lower house of parliament.  Budget Minister Valerie Pecresse said on Thursday she still hoped to get the measure adopted but for now the attempt to net an annual 90 million euros ($129 million) extra is in abeyance after the backlash from lawmakers with major theme parks located in their constituencies.  Parc Asterix, less than an hour’s drive north of Paris, charges children 30 euros and enchanted grown-ups 40 euros to relive the legendary Roman-repelling feats of the plucky Gallic warrior and his colleagues, according to the park’s webpage.  Along with Eurodisney, the European home of Mickey Mouse and a myriad of other heroes of American culture, Asterix is one of the more internationally known crowd-grabbers within a wider theme park offer that includes a futuristic multimedia attraction in the political constituency of a former prime minister, the Futuroscope park in Western France.  Minister Pecresse says other holiday and leisure offers are taxed at the near-20 percent VAT rate and in hard times there is no reason to continue a theme park discount introduced in the 1980s under last Socialist President Francois Mitterrand.

145,DIS,BASIS POINT-Shanghai Shendi seeks 20 bln yuan loan for Disney park -sources," (The following report is provided by Thomson Reuters loans reporting group Basis Point)	   By Kane Wu	   HONG KONG, Sept 1 (Reuters Basis Point) - State-owned Shanghai Shendi Group is seeking an over Rmb20bn financing from a dozen local banks to back the construction of the planned Disney theme park in Shanghai, banking sources told Thomson Reuters Basis Point.	   The 12 banks include mandated lead arrangers Bank of Communications, China Development Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China joined as co-lead arrangers, while Bank of Shanghai, China Citic Bank, Huaxia Bank, Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank and Export-Import Bank of China came in as participants.	   The banks have signed a financing framework agreement with the Shanghai government without confirmed allocations, sources said. 	   The financing is structured as a shareholder loan and tenor is expected to be at least 10 years, sources said.	   Shanghai Shendi is a joint-venture investment holding company formed by Shanghai Lujiazui (Group) Co Ltd, Shanghai Radio, Film & Television Development Co Ltd, and Jinjiang International Group Holding Company.	   The proposed theme park is 57% owned by the Shanghai government and 43% owned by Walt Disney Co. BNP Paribas is financial adviser to the Shanghai government.	   The Disney project is part of the government’s Pudong District 12th Five-Year Plan.	   “(Because) it’s a government initiated project, we have to cooperate and show our commitment,” a banking source said.	   “We do not expect to profit much from the deal, and may break even or lose money,” said another banking source. “If the government did not have a stake in this, we would not have participated.”	   Sources said the banks have signed confidentiality agreements with the government and the company, especially promising not to reveal the actual deal size.	   “The government does not want to arouse negative reactions from the media on how much money it spends on the Disney project,” one source said.	   Confidentiality agreements between the banks and the company were signed after a March report published in the 21st Century Business Herald, a Chinese newspaper based in Shanghai, saying that the project needed more than Rmb110bn investment, almost 10 times the amount of Hong Kong Disneyland.	   Hong Kong Disneyland operator Hongkong International Theme Parks Ltd borrowed HK$3.3bn (US$423m) in November 2000 for the construction of the Hong Kong theme park.	   Hong Kong Disneyland’s 15-year financing was repaid ahead of maturity with an equity injection from the Hong Kong government. The Hong Kong theme park had been unable to meet its performance target for the first year of operation, thus breaching a clause in the covenant tied to its debt service coverage ratio. With early repayment, the theme park avoided defaulting on its loan.	   The Shanghai Disney Resort broke ground in April, with an initial investment of about Rmb24.5bn (US$3.7bn) to build the theme park and a further Rmb4.5bn (US$0.7bn) for other aspects, including hotels and the retail, dining and entertainment areas, according to the park’s official website.	   The first phase of the park construction covers an area of 3.9 square kilometres. It is slated to open in 2014. On completion, the park will be the world’s sixth Disney theme park, and the first and only in the Chinese mainland.

147,DIS,UPDATE 4-Netflix shares fall after stumble with Starz," * Shares drop 8.6 pct to $213.11 after Starz deal collapse   * Short interest over 15 pct in August   * Many analysts still bullish  (Rewrites with analyst and investor comments; updates shares)   By Lisa Richwine and Himank Sharma   LOS ANGELES/BANGALORE, Sept 2 (Reuters) - High-flying Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) saw its shares fall 8.6 percent on Friday after failing to secure a chunk of movie content for the online service it touts as the future of its popular video rental business.   The collapse of talks, announced Thursday, with cable channel operator Starz Entertainment underscored investor concerns that Netflix may lose its edge in online rentals.   Under the leadership of well-regarded Chief Executive Reed Hastings, Netflix shares have tripled since January 2010. But the rocketing price and recent stumbles, including a July decision to raise some prices, have drawn short sellers betting the momentum cannot continue.   Hastings decided to raise prices for subscribers who still want DVDs-by-mail, a move seen as emphasizing higher-margin streaming plans. The price hike angered so many customers that the company warned it would see a pause in its normally explosive subscriber growth.   Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, who has rated Netflix “underperform” for more than a year, said the failure to make a deal with Starz was evidence of higher content costs the company must grapple with as providers recognize their leverage.   “Starz is the perfect example. Content owners have to play hardball with Netflix,” said Pachter, who has a $110 price target on Netflix shares.   Starz, controlled by John Malone’s Liberty Media LSTZA.O LINTA.O, ended talks with Netflix to renew a streaming deal. After February, Starz will stop providing its content, which includes exclusive rights to first-run Sony Corp (6758.T) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) movies, for streaming on Netflix. [ID:nN1E7801V6]   Netflix said Starz movies and shows account for just 8 percent of U.S. subscribers’ viewing, but some analysts said lack of new content may lead to higher customer attrition.   Netflix has long enjoyed a near-monopoly in the online streaming space but the recent entry of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Google Inc’s (GOOG.O) YouTube could potentially lead to subscribers switching to alternative services.  The field could get even more crowded. Dish Networks (DISH.O), which won Blockbuster Inc in a bankruptcy auction for $320 million, is expected to expand its business beyond satellite TV and eventually into online video streaming.   “Rising content costs and increasing competition from incumbent and new players alike remain our top concerns,” UBS analyst Brian Fitzgerald said of Netflix.   Yoni Jacobs. portfolio manager for Chart Prophet Capital, said he previously shorted Netflix in the face of growing competition in the online market and a “weak” streaming library. Jacobs covered his short position when Netflix shares hit $200 but remains negative on the company’s outlook.   “Their library is even weaker now” after the breakdown with Starz, Jacobs said.   Gareth Feighery, a founder of Philadelphia-based options education firm MarketTamer.com, said the inability to renew the Starz contract could just be the trigger for short sellers.    “The failure to strike a deal with Starz might be just the fundamental event the short sellers have been waiting to pounce upon.”   Netflix is one of the heaviest shorted blue-chip technology stocks. Its shares have a short interest of 15.5 percent as of August, implying that more than 1 in 6 Netflix shares is shorted. Blue-chip technology stocks like Google and Apple (AAPL.O) have short interest positions below 2 percent.   Content owners and short-sellers have questioned how Netflix can charge customers so little. [ID:nN1E76C0AM]   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   For Starmine data on Netflix: r.reuters.com/jat53s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   Netflix was offering to pay somewhere in the $200 million to $300 million range annually for rights to stream Starz content, a source familiar with the negotiations said.   Some analysts remain positive on Netflix’s prospects to secure alternative deals.   Stifel Nicolaus analyst George Askew, who has a “hold” rating on the company’s stock, said the loss of the Starz contract could help Netflix in the long term, as it could use the money for replacement content.

After that date, Starz will stop providing its content, which includes exclusive rights to first-run Sony Corp (6758.T) and Walt Disney Co  (DIS.N) movies, for streaming on Netflix.   Shares of Netflix were down 8.7 percent at $213 in after-hours trade, from a close on the Nasdaq of $233.27.   Netflix was offering to pay somewhere in the $200 million to $300 million range annually for rights to stream Starz content, a source familiar with the negotiations said. Starz balked at that offer, the source said.   Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in June it “wouldn’t be shocking” to pay up to $200 million, a figure some analysts had predicted.   The original online streaming rights are believed to have been agreed for around $30 million a year four years ago, people familiar with the deal have said.   Starz, in a statement, called its decision to end talks with Netflix “a result of our strategy to protect the premium nature of our brand by preserving the appropriate pricing and packaging” of its content.   The news came the same day that an unpopular Netflix price hike of as much as $6 per month took effect. The breakdown with Starz was a surprise because investors had expected the parties to reach a deal, said Brett Harriss, an analyst with Gabelli & Co.   “Netflix just effectively raised prices by 60 percent, and a big chunk of their content walked away,” Harriss said.   Thursday’s announcement could open up the possibility that Starz might now court another online streaming provider, such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) or Google Inc’s Youtube (GOOG.O).   Starz was not immediately available for further comment.   Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey said the company was “confident we can take the money we had earmarked for Starz renewal next year and spend it with other content providers to maintain or even improve the Netflix experience.”   Netflix said Starz movies and shows account for just 8 percent of U.S. subscribers’ viewing, and the company had projected that to fall to 5-6 percent by the first quarter of 2012, right when the deal dies.   Starz is the exclusive distributor of first-run Sony and Disney movies on pay-TV in the United States under an agreement that allows it to distribute the programming wholesale on multiple platforms, including online streaming.   But Netflix — which has grown faster than partners expected — triggered a deal clause in the first quarter when it announced it now has more than 22.8 million subscribers in the United States, of which nearly two-thirds were streaming videos, sources told Reuters in June. [ID:nN1E75J1JD]   Under terms of the original contract, the trigger allowed Sony to ask Starz for better financial terms, the sources had said.   Sony’s content already was removed from the Netflix streaming service while negotiations were underway. Disney movies were accessible.

152,DIS,"UPDATE 1-'The Help' wins box office, summer hits record"," * ‘The Help’ holds top spot with $19 million   * ‘The Debt’ takes second place   * Summer sales break Hollywood record  (Adds details on top five films, summer sales totals)   By Lisa Richwine   LOS ANGELES, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The maids of “The Help” didn’t take the Labor Day weekend off. The surprise summer hit held firm at the top of the domestic box office for the third straight week with $19 million in ticket sales.   The drama about white women and their black maids in Civil Rights-era Mississippi polished off three new films based on four-day estimates released by movie studios on Monday, the U.S. Labor Day holiday that ended a record summer at U.S. and Canadian theaters. “The Help,” a critics favorite that debuted a month ago in the No. 2 spot, was produced by DreamWorks and distributed by Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).   Newcomers including two horror flicks generated modest sales on a weekend traditionally slow for movie-going.   Spy thriller “The Debt,” starring Helen Mirren, took second place with a better-than-expected $12.6 million in the North American (U.S. and Canadian) market. The film tells the story of the hunt for a Nazi war criminal and how the mission haunts a trio of secret agents three decades later. The film drew an older audience with 70 percent of moviegoers over age 40, distributor Focus Features said.   The studio released the movie on Wednesday, and estimated domestic sales since it debuted reached $14.5 million.   Space mystery “Apollo 18,” a new release that purports to use “found footage” of an ill-fated trip to the moon, came in third for the weekend with $10.7 million. That fell within studio projections for a film that cost less than $5 million to make, said Erik Lomis, president of distribution for The Weinstein Co, which released the film.   Following behind at No. 4 was new thriller “Shark Night (3-D),” a tale of nightmarish fresh-water shark attacks at a Louisiana lake house, with $10.3 million, at the higher end of industry expectations. Aimed at teens, the film drew 57 percent of its audience from an under-25 crowd.   Sci-fi flick “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” stayed strong, rounding out the top five with $10.3 million during its fifth weekend in theaters.   “Apes,” a revival of the classic tale of chimps launching a revolution, and “The Help” stood out as two surprise summer hits. “Apes” has rung up $162.5 million in domestic sales and $186.5 million in international markets, for a combined total of $349 million.   “The Help” has pulled in about $123.4 million since it hit U.S. and Canadian theaters, exceeding forecasts from box-office watchers. The film is an adaptation of a best-selling novel by Kathryn Stockett.   The two movies helped Hollywood rack up record sales for the four-month summer season measured from early May through Labor Day, when studios bring in as much as 40 percent of annual revenue. Domestic totals hit an estimated $4.4 billion for the period, a 0.7 percent increase from last year, according to figures from Hollywood.com Box Office.   The revenue gain was helped by slightly higher average ticket prices as movie attendance fell 1.4 percent.   “Though attendance figures are down, the performance is still impressive given the intense competition” for audiences posed by a range of entertainment options, said Paul Dergarabedian, head of Hollywood.com Box Office.   Summer hits included big sequels such as “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2” and “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” plus superhero tales such as “Captain America: The First Avenger” and family film “The Smurfs.” Adult comedies, including “Bridesmaids” and “The Hangover 2” also scored with audiences.   “The Debt” was released by Focus Features, a unit of Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) Universal Pictures. Privately held Weinstein Co released “Apollo 18.” Closely held Relativity Media released “Shark Night (3-D)” in the United States and eOne distributed the film in Canada.   “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” was released by 20th Century Fox, the film studio of News Corp (NWSA.O).

Philbin, who turned 80 years-old on August 25, said in January that this current season would be his last on the program, and on Tuesday he finally put a hard date on the end.  “Friday, November 18 is my last day,” he told viewers of the program. “But don’t worry, the show goes on.”  There was no word on who will replace the popular octogenarian, but Philbin joked that co-host Kelly Ripa “will be trying out new” men and seeking a “new young hot” one to sit by her side.  Ripa joined Philbin in 2001, replacing his former co-host Kathie Lee Gifford.

Andrew Mooney, known for creating the popular Disney Princess franchise, “has decided to resign from his post,” Disney said in a statement. A replacement has not been named.   In an email to employees that was released by Disney, Mooney thanked Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger “for his understanding in my desire to pursue other ambitions.”   Mooney, 55, said it was the “perfect time” to take his experience at Disney and, before that, at shoe and apparel maker Nike (NKE.N) “into a leadership role with another organization and corporate boards.”   A source familiar with the matter said Mooney had reached the point where he wanted to run his own company and to consider offers to serve on corporate boards. Disney forbids its executives from sitting on other companies’ boards.   Revenue at Consumer Products, the second fastest growing Disney segment, climbed 13 percent to $685 million in the quarter ended July 2, accounting for just above 6 percent of the theme park operator and media company’s total revenue that quarter.   Miller Tabak analyst David Joyce said Mooney may already have fielded CEO offers from other companies after a solid record at Disney.   “He’s done a good job there. The consumer products division is integral to the overall brand and character development at Disney,” Joyce said.   A native of Scotland, Mooney created the Disney Princess franchise, bringing Disney’s Snow White, Cinderella and other princesses under one umbrella.   He also oversaw the merchandising of characters from popular films such as “Toy Story” and “Cars” and revamped the retail Disney Stores. He will stay at Disney through the end of the month, which marks the end of Disney’s fiscal year.   “Not only has he consistently delivered business results year after year, but his focus on the Disney brand and the creation of new franchises like Disney Princess will leave a legacy for decades,” Iger said in a statement.   Before joining Disney, Mooney spent 20 years at Nike, rising to chief marketing officer.   Shares of Disney were trading 2.2 percent lower at $31.75 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, a steeper drop than the 1.3 percent decline in the Standard & Poor’s media index. .GSPME  (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Gary Hill)  ",9062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-consumer/update-3-disneys-consumer-products-chief-resigns-idUSN1E78514U20110906

158,DIS,Netflix to combat piracy as it expands into Latam,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Netflix will fight piracy with quality content that people would pay for, while expanding its online streaming service to Latin America and the Caribbean, the company’s chief executive said on Wednesday.  Netflix Inc will invest close to $70 million in the region this year on content and marketing.  The movie-rental company launched its online streaming service in Brazil this week. It costs about $9 a month and will expand to Argentina and the rest of the region next week.  “We’re in this for the long term. We’re expanding in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, the rest of Latin America. It’s good for us to learn the taste, to know which movies are most popular,” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings told Reuters in an interview in Buenos Aires.  Although piracy remains a challenge because of the endemic knock-off DVDs sold on the streets and the widely available pirated online content, Hastings remains confident viewers will turn on to Netflix for its quality and wide selection.  “What we can offer is a service that works so well that you can just click and watch, and with such good content that people are willing to pay 39 (Argentine) pesos” a month, he said. That is the equivalent of about $8.80.  Over the next six months, the company plans to double the amount of content, including Argentine films and TV shows. For now, Netflix began its operations in the region with broad content that appeals to most viewers, including family films such as Apollo 13, which Hastings displayed online.  The firm will move into Asia or Europe by early 2012.  “Both Europe and Asia are great markets. They’re both very attractive,” Hastings said. “In Asia, there’s so many people and so many Internet users but very high piracy. And in Europe, the economy is not as fast-growing but there is less piracy. Both will be important to us as we expand. We just have to figure out the order; we’ll do one and then the other.”  Under the leadership of Hastings, Netflix shares have tripled in value since January 2010. But the stock rally and recent stumbles, including a July decision to raise some prices, have drawn short sellers betting the momentum cannot continue.  Netflix shares plunged last Friday, a day after Pay-TV operator Starz Entertainment decided not to renew its contract with the movie-rental company. The collapse of talks with Starz highlighted investor concerns that Netflix may lose its edge in online rentals.  But Hastings downplayed the importance of the deal, which includes exclusive rights to first-run Sony Corp and Walt Disney Co movies, for streaming on Netflix.  “The Starz content deal is only in the U.S. and it’s less than 10 percent of our content viewership, so it’s actually relatively small. So we’ll replace that with other content,” Hastings said.  “In each country we try to see what people are watching and try to do more of that. Over the next weeks, we’ll be watching what Argentines are watching,” he said.

161,DIS,"ESPN, NFL reach $15 billion Monday Night Football deal","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The National Football League and ESPN have agreed to a deal that will keep “Monday Night Football” on the cable sports network through 2021, extending the current contract by eight years, the two sides said on Thursday.  Announced on the same day as the NFL was set to begin its 2011 season, the deal is worth $1.9 billion a year — or about $15.2 billion over the life of the contract — according to a source familiar with the negotiations. That is about 73 percent more than ESPN previously paid the NFL.  The deal will give ESPN 17 regular season NFL games along with rights to the Pro Bowl, NFL draft, 3-D distribution and Spanish language and international broadcasts. ESPN will also get rights to more than 500 hours of NFL-branded studio programing.  ESPN, a division of Walt Disney Co, has carried a full 17-game “Monday Night Football” schedule since 2006 and has become one of the network’s — and cable television’s — most valuable franchises. Last season, “Monday Night Football” was the highest-rated Monday program on broadcast and cable TV among young men.  The current deal, which paid the NFL about $1.1 billion a year, was to expire in 2013.  ESPN plans a number of new highlight and preview shows, and intends to develop their distribution on tablet devices such as the iPad, ESPN and ABC Sports President George Bodenheimer said on a conference call with reporters on Thursday.  “This agreement will fuel ESPN on a year-round basis because it touches all corners of our company and supports our best available screen strategy, with NFL content on TV, online and on mobile devices,” Bodenheimer said.

Announced on the same day as the NFL was set to begin its 2011 season, the deal is worth $1.9 billion a year — or about $15.2 billion over the life of the contract — according to a source familiar with the negotiations. That is about 73 percent more than ESPN previously paid the NFL.   The deal will give ESPN 17 regular season NFL games along with rights to the Pro Bowl, NFL draft, 3-D distribution and Spanish language and international broadcasts. ESPN will also get rights to more than 500 hours of NFL-branded studio programming.   ESPN, a division of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), has carried a full 17-game “Monday Night Football” schedule since 2006 and has become one of the network’s — and cable television’s — most valuable franchises. Last season, “Monday Night Football” was the highest-rated Monday program on broadcast and cable TV among young men.   The current deal, which paid the NFL about $1.1 billion a year, was to expire in 2013.   ESPN plans a number of new highlight and preview shows, and intends to develop their distribution on tablet devices such as the iPad, ESPN and ABC Sports President George Bodenheimer said on a conference call with reporters on Thursday.   “This agreement will fuel ESPN on a year-round basis because it touches all corners of our company and supports our best available screen strategy, with NFL content on TV, online and on mobile devices,” Bodenheimer said.   NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said it was encouraging to have a long-term deal during difficult economic times and it was aided by the league’s ability to reach a new 10-year collective bargaining agreement with its players in July.   “The long-term nature of this is the result not only of a successful partnership (with ESPN) but also the ability to reach a long-term agreement with our players,” Goodell said. “This will be beneficial to the players, our league and our fans.”  (Reporting by Paul Thomasch; Additional reporting by Simon Evans in Miami; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)     ",9082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/espn-nfl/update-1-espn-nfl-reach-15-bln-monday-night-football-deal-idUSN1E78716W20110908
163,DIS,"Layaway, $15 toys among Walmart's holiday plans","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Eager to keep its sales momentum growing, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is kicking off the holiday season early, cutting some toy prices in September, offering layaway in October and selling more Christmas decorations.  The winter holiday season, which traditionally runs from the day after U.S. Thanksgiving through Christmas, is the most important time of year for retailers. In recent years, U.S. chains including Walmart have advertised earlier and offered deeper discounts to drive sales amid the struggling economy.  Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is getting back into layaway after a five-year break, albeit on a smaller scale, after other chains received a boost by offering the service during the downturn. It is also bringing back a host of items, such as Christmas village sets and outdoor decorations, that it had removed from stores last year as part of a failed attempt to streamline its assortment of goods.  The moves announced on Thursday come as the chain’s core shoppers continue to face a fragile economy including steep gasoline and food prices, high unemployment and a housing slump.  Sales at stores open at least a year fell for nine straight quarters, as shoppers went elsewhere, but they rose in July.  As Walmart’s sales rebound and the company works on cutting expenses, it can again become more aggressive with its pricing, said Gilford Securities analyst Bernard Sosnick.  During the last couple of years, Walmart had a small amount of Christmas merchandise in its stores in the middle of October. This year, those items will arrive in late September.  Wal-Mart is cutting prices on dozens of toys to $15 starting September 12, including Leapfrog LF.N Scribble and Write, Disney (DIS.N) Princess Toddler Doll, Hasbro Inc (HAS.O) Transformers 3 Mechtech and certain Lego sets. Those toys typically sell for around $20. That “rollback,” as Walmart calls it, is also coming a little earlier than usual.  The layaway plan, which debuts on October 17, has restrictions and fees that should help reduce costs and complications that caused Walmart to walk away from general merchandise layaway after several years in 2006.  Wal-Mart, which still offers layaway on fine jewelry year-round, said its customers have been asking about layaway for other things. At this point, it will have layaway for toys and electronics leading up to Christmas and will then evaluate whether to proceed with a broader year-round plan.  “We’re always looking for ways to ease budget strain for our customers, and we know this holiday season in particular brings with it additional financial pressure,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising officer.  Customers must spend at least $50 to sign up for layaway, and each item has to be priced at $15 or more. Customers must pay a $5 fee, put 10 percent down and complete their payments and pick up their items by December 16, or they risk having to pay a $10 cancellation fee.  After Walmart walked away from layaway, other chains kick-started programs and found success.  Sears Holdings Corp’s (SHLD.O) Kmart chain has been offering layaway plans for more than 40 years to help customers make expensive purchases. It offers many items for layaway, including appliances, clothes, electronics, furniture and toys.  Kmart gave its customers up to 12 weeks to pay for layaway purchases during the 2010 holiday season, versus the eight weeks that is typical. Normally, an eight-week contract requires a $5 service fee and a 12-week layaway contract requires a $10 service fee.  Toys R Us began offering layaway at its stores during the 2009 holiday season and has expanded the program to include a wider variety of items, such as iPods and digital cameras. Generally, it charges a $10 fee for layaway, and in the event an order is canceled, a $10 charge.

166,DIS,Analysis: Plenty of backstage drama in TV season,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - This fall’s TV schedule will be full of twenty-somethings looking for love, singers searching out fame and dinosaurs hunting down dinner — and if that’s not enough, there promises to be a heap of drama behind the scenes.  What unfolds at NBC and ABC will be among the most closely watched developments of the 2011-12 season. Both have relatively new entertainment chiefs in Bob Greenblatt and Paul Lee, who made major changes to their prime-time schedules in hopes of resurrecting ratings and satisfying management at Comcast Corp and Walt Disney Co.  Fox and CBS, with stronger schedules, will be under less scrutiny, but all four broadcast networks could feel the heat from advertisers who signed pricey deals for commercial time. Last spring, during the dealmaking period, commercial rates rose around 10 percent from a year earlier.  The trouble is that concerns over the economy have intensified since advertisers made those deals — today there is far more talk about a double-dip recession — and they could be taking a hard look at spending plans.  Along Madison Avenue, anticipation is running high for “The X Factor,” a new musical competition from Simon Cowell that Fox hopes will be a blockbuster along the lines of “American Idol.” Advertisers paid up to $400,000 for 30-second spots and it boasts a clutch of blue-chip corporate sponsors, including Pepsi and Chevrolet.  Other shows that are generating buzz — for better or worse — include ABC’s “Pan Am” and “Charlie’s Angels,” NBC’s “The Playboy Club,” “Smash” and “Prime Suspect,” and Fox’s “Terra Nova,” a costly Steven Spielberg-produced dinosaur drama burdened with high expectations.  Last year, more than three-quarters of the new shows were canceled and several barely lasted a month, the most notable being “Lonestar,” a high profile con-man drama that Fox abandoned after two episodes.  “Look, all these guys are under pressure,” said Brad Adgate, senior vice president of research at advertising firm Horizon Media. “You get next day ratings and must immediately make million dollar decisions. Every day there is a hero and every day there is a goat. But there’s probably more pressure on ABC than anybody.”  Now president of ABC Entertainment, Lee spent 7 years running ABC Family until he was promoted in July 2010. This is his second full TV season running ABC, but the first one in which he’s been involved from development through scheduling.  Lee can bank on the popular comedy “Modern Family” and “Grey’s Anatomy” is still a top rated drama, but this will be the last season of the long-running “Desperate Housewives” and there are already some major holes in the lineup.  “His problem is that there aren’t a lot of building blocks there,” said David Scardino, entertainment specialist at media agency RPA. “I don’t know how much patience Disney is going to have with him.”  NBC’s Greenblatt, meanwhile, should have some breathing room. Comcast hired him away from Showtime, where he had a solid track record, and has indicated it does not expect to revive NBC’s fortunes in one season. For 2011-12, Greenblatt will bring out a hefty 12 new shows, including “Smash,” a midseason musical set on Broadway that will star Katherine McPhee from “American Idol.”  “Comcast is at least paying lip service to the fact that this won’t be turned around overnight,” Scardino said.  The biggest surprise of the TV season may be if either ABC or NBC manage to move up in the ratings. That would mean beating out either News Corp’s Fox, with several blockbuster hits, or CBS Corp’s CBS, with the strongest top-to-bottom schedule in the business.  Another shocker would be if the four broadcast networks can arrest the steady decline in their collective audience.  One reason for the drop in viewership at the broadcast networks is the increasing competition from cable TV, with its critical and popular hits such as “Mad Men,” “Breaking Bad,” and “Justified.” Advertisers are well aware of the trend and swallowed huge price increases from the cable networks during the spring negotiations.  It remains to be seen whether advertisers will start to back away from pricey deals in general, exercising options that allow them to cancel.  “There is always a lag between what the economy is doing currently and where the budgets are — since budgets are done early,” said Scardino. “If I was on the network side, I would be nervous.”  ",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-drama/analysis-plenty-of-backstage-drama-in-tv-season-idUSTRE7886K420110909
167,DIS,UPDATE 1-Disney promotes Chapek to consumer products chief," * Chapek headed distribution for Disney studios   * Disney combining consumer products units across company   * Disney shares drop amid broad stock decline   LOS ANGELES, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Friday promoted its studio distribution chief, Robert Chapek, to head of the consumer products unit that licenses characters such as Mickey Mouse for toys, clothing and other products.   Chapek replaces Andrew Mooney, who resigned earlier this week to pursue leadership roles at other companies.   Disney said Chapek will oversee a newly formed company-wide consumer products unit that will consolidate retail and licensing across businesses, including Walt Disney Studios, Pixar, Marvel and its interactive and media network units.   “As the retail market becomes more centralized, it is important to provide the consumer with an array of choices in a seamless, coordinated way,” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement.   Revenue at Consumer Products, the second-fastest growing Disney segment, climbed 13 percent to $685 million in the quarter ended July 2, accounting for just above 6 percent of the theme park operator and media company’s total revenue that quarter.   The unit brings in revenue from licensing classic characters such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh plus characters from film franchises such as “Toy Story” and “Cars.”   Since November 2009, Chapek was in charge of distribution for The Walt Disney Studios, overseeing delivery of television and movie content in theaters, homes, cable TV, digital formats and new media.   Disney shares were trading 3 percent lower at $30.99 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange amid a broad market sell-off. The Standard & Poor’s media .GSPME index was down 2.6 percent.

Six international markets added another $2.1 million.  Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film tells the story of a fast-spreading killer virus and scientists’ efforts to stop it as the body count rises. The movie features an all-star cast that includes Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne and Jude Law.  The film beat studio expectations by telling “a tough story in a provocative way. There is nothing more icky than this,” said Jeff Goldstein, executive vice president of domestic distribution for Warner Bros.  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the movie a B- rating on average.  “The Help,” a critics and audience favorite about black maids who speak out about white employers in civil rights-era Mississippi, slipped to second place after three straight weeks as the box-office leader. The film soaked up $8.7 million, pushing up its domestic receipts to $137.1 million since the book adaptation hit theaters five weeks ago.  “Warrior,” a new drama about two brothers who battle for victory and redemption in a mixed-martial arts tournament, finished third with a disappointing $5.6 million. The brothers, a war veteran played by Tom Hardy and a high-school teacher and father played by Joel Edgerton, face wounds from the past as their estranged father, portrayed Nick Nolte, works as one of their coaches.  The film earned an A from audiences polled by CinemaScore and positive reviews from critics.  “We’re going to continue to fight.

172,DIS,"Fund view: Manning & Napier eyes tech, healthcare for growth","(Reuters) - As U.S. economic growth slows, Manning & Napier is increasing its focus on areas in technology and healthcare that have growth drivers independent of the economy, said Jeffrey Coons, the firm’s president and co-director of research.  He is part of a team that manages the Fairport, New York-based Manning & Napier Equity Series Fund which had $2.2 billion in assets under management as of end-June.  Coons is targeting technology companies like Google Inc, Amazon.com and Walt Disney Co and took advantage of last month’s market volatility to increase holdings in them.  “There’s a push toward the use of the Internet for a lot of computing and entertainment ... more time is spent on the Internet and, as a result of that, advertising dollars are flowing there,” Coons told Reuters in an interview.  The fund is also “overweight” on media oriented companies that distribute content across multiple channels, said Coons, who joined Manning & Napier in 1985.  In healthcare, demand for services of diagnostics companies and healthcare information technology companies will grow regardless of the pace of growth in the U.S. economy over the next year or two, he said.  Coons likes healthcare IT company Cerner Corp, which is one of the fund’s largest holdings and formed 3.25 percent of its portfolio as of June 30.  Debt concerns in the United States and the euro zone sovereign debt crisis make Coons skeptical of financials — a sector to which he assigns a relatively low weight.  Coons said he is avoiding commercial banks and trimming his holdings in trust banks like Northern Trust Corp.  Trust banks are not earning much in money markets where interest rates are low and they have not been able to shift their clients over to some of their longer term products, he said.  “We are focused on either asset gathering companies or companies related to the credit card business which we feel are one of the few areas in financials that have growth potential.”  Coons likes Charles Schwab Corp among financials and thinks it will be a net gainer in the retail brokerage space as more investment advisers use the company for their back office work.  The Manning & Napier Equity Series Fund has risen 14.22 percent in the year to end-August, underperforming the Russell 3000 index’s 19.30 percent gain.

173,DIS,Few sure winners seen at the Emmy Awards,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - If there are any sure bets at this year’s Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, they are “Modern Family” again being crowned TV’s best comedy series and Kate Winslet winning for her role in “Mildred Pierce”.  Most everything else is up for grabs at the TV industry’s highest honors in what awards watchers call one of the closest Emmys in years.  “There are a lot of predictions, but no sure bets and that’s why the Emmys is packing some excitement this year,” said Todd Gold, managing editor of Xfinity TV. “It is full of outstanding shows from networks to cable, and premium cable.”  Even critical darling “Mad Men” cannot rest on its laurels as a three-time best drama winner, despite its 19 nominations.  But the stylish 1960s advertising drama faces a threat from HBO’s new prohibition era series “Boardwalk Empire”, which not only won Golden Globe and Screen Actor’s Guild prizes earlier this year but walked off with seven trophies last weekend at the creative arts portion of Emmy Awards.  “It looked as if ‘Mad Men’ was going into this year’s Emmys as the inevitable winner. But all of a sudden, we have a real race here,” said Tom O’Neil of awards websites TheEnvelope.com and Goldderby.com.

174,DIS,Few sure winners seen at the Emmy Awards," * Drama “Mad Men” bids for 4th straight Emmy win   * Tough races seen for best TV drama and comedy actors   * Primetime Emmys to air Sept. 18 on Fox television   By Jill Serjeant   LOS ANGELES, Sept 14 (Reuters) - If there are any sure bets at this year’s Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, they are “Modern Family” again being crowned TV’s best comedy series and Kate Winslet winning for her role in “Mildred Pierce”.   Most everything else is up for grabs at the TV industry’s highest honors in what awards watchers call one of the closest Emmys in years.   “There are a lot of predictions, but no sure bets and that’s why the Emmys is packing some excitement this year,” said Todd Gold, managing editor of Xfinity TV. “It is full of outstanding shows from networks to cable, and premium cable.”   Even critical darling “Mad Men” cannot rest on its laurels as a three-time best drama winner, despite its 19 nominations.   But the stylish 1960s advertising drama faces a threat from HBO’s new prohibition era series “Boardwalk Empire”, which not only won Golden Globe and Screen Actor’s Guild prizes earlier this year but walked off with seven trophies last weekend at the creative arts portion of Emmy Awards.   “It looked as if ‘Mad Men’ was going into this year’s Emmys as the inevitable winner. But all of a sudden, we have a real race here,” said Tom O’Neil of awards websites TheEnvelope.com and Goldderby.com.   And don’t count out HBO’s fantasy series “Game of Thrones”, based on the best-selling novels by George R.R.

175,DIS,"Hollywood rolls out red carpet for Cowell's ""X Factor""","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - There aren’t many reality TV shows that stage their own world premiere.  But this is Simon Cowell and his much-hyped new singing contest “The X Factor”, which rolled out the red carpet in Hollywood on Wednesday night ahead of his return to U.S. television next week.  A year after walking away from his job as a judge on “American Idol” — the most watched show on U.S. TV — the brash Briton has lost none of his self-confidence. His new venture, in which he is both creator and executive producer as well as a judge, is promoted with the simple tagline “He’s Back.”  “I am feeling excited now. There is always nerves before a launch but it is good nerves...I have always wanted to have, not a film premiere, but a TV premiere in the cinema. I think it is brilliant”, Cowell said of Wednesday’s splashy event at one of Hollywood’s top cinemas.  Americans get their first look at “The X Factor” on September 21. But a pumped-up audience of hundreds of Twitter fans and competition winners from across the United States, were invited to the premiere to see just what the fuss was all about.  “I’ve never been to a premiere of a TV show where this many people came out,” said Mike Darnell, head of reality TV programing at Fox, as Cowell and his fellow judges entered the movie theater to the booming soundtrack of “Live and Let Die.”  “X Factor,” already a huge hit in the U.K. offers an unprecedented $5 million prize for the winner. Judges compete with each other as mentors to singers and to groups of performers aged 12 and up who audition in arenas packed with thousands of people.  The show brings Cowell’s cutting sarcasm back to primetime television and reunites him with his old “American Idol” sparring partner, the erratic but endearing Paula Abdul. Former Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Scherzinger and record producer Antonio “L.A, “ Reid complete the judging panel.  “Paula can be a bit wacky at times, but Nicole isn’t far behind,” Cowell quipped, going on to describe working with Abdul as “like getting an old dog back from the rescue pound. It’s kind of grateful to see you, and the relationship is back intact.”  Cowell has set the bar high for the “X Factor”, calling it a “game-changer” for TV that he says will thrash the competition and beat “American Idol” — also on Fox — as the most popular show in America.  Fox and advertisers are also looking for results. Advertisers have spent up to $400,000 for a 30 second spot, and Fox hopes that it will help reverse the network’s traditionally patchy showing in the fall TV ratings.  According to Cowell, Fox was nervous about taking the leap. “The network would initially have been happier if we had all stayed on ‘Idol’ for the rest of our lives and there wouldn’t be another show,” he said ahead of the premiere.  But Cowell said Fox later accepted that, given the show’s success in the UK, a competitor might come along. “They didn’t have to be dragged kicking and screaming to it in the end. But these are expensive shows to produce,” he said.  Getting the show off the ground in the U.S. hasn’t been without challenges. Cowell made a rare misstep earlier this year when he chose British singer Cheryl Cole — unknown in the United States — as a judge and then swiftly removed her when she underperformed in early tapings.  In the version Americans will see next week, Cole is on the first show, but not on the second — a change introduced merely with the line “a new city, and a new judge”.  “Lots of things went wrong along the way,” Cowell said of the Cole saga. “Bad things happen when you make reality shows, but you’ve just got to deal with it.”  ",9152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-xfactor/hollywood-rolls-out-red-carpet-for-cowells-x-factor-idUSTRE78E52020110915

179,DIS,Hulu sale at risk even as new bids are due,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The auction of online video site Hulu has been slowed by recent developments which could derail it completely, according to sources familiar with the process.  Among the issues are conflicts over complicated digital rights, a wide bid-ask gap, and Yahoo being sidelined as a potential buyer by its own issues. Moreover, NBC Universal’s hiring of Morgan Stanley banker Stuart Epstein, who was involved in the sale process for the bank, as its chief financial officer complicates a potential deal.  And then there is the lack of commitment to sell by Hulu’s owners — News Corp, Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and Providence Equity Partners.  News Corp Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey even acknowledged during the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month that a Hulu sale might not happen.  A new round of bids are due next week and price will be in a key issue in whether the auction moves forward, according to a source close to the situation.  Other sources with knowledge of the talks said an unusually wide gap has developed in recent weeks between the price bidders are offering and what the Hulu owners are willing to accept. Hulu’s owners are becoming more steadfast about the price and feel enough strategic alternatives are available to reject low-ball offers, sources said.  Bids have ranged from as low as $500 million to as much as $2 billion. The most serious suitors include Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc, DirecTV Group Inc and DISH Network Corp.  Yahoo Inc had been viewed as one of the most enthusiastic likely bidders, but that was before its leadership imploded last week with the firing of CEO Carol Bartz. The company is likely to be too preoccupied with its own issues to digest a multibillion dollar deal. Moreover, Hulu’s owners would be reluctant to sell to a company undergoing an internal upheaval.  As with any sale, the situation is fluid and there remains a chance Google or another party could swoop in with a rich offer. Reports have suggested Google was planning an offer, but company insiders are uncertain Hulu’s media owners would sanction a sale to the search engine giant — at least not without caveats such as blocking piracy searches, for example.  After intense initial interest due to Hulu’s huge and growing popularity, the sale has stalled as bidders questioned what they would get for their money.  One senior media executive said the nature of Hulu’s content deals is key to whether a deal happens or not.  “I guess the brand and technology are worth something, but probably not for that asking price because digital companies could develop a site on their own,” the executive said, who asked not to be identified speaking about a partner company.  CBS Corp boss Les Moonves openly questioned Hulu’s value during an interview at a Paley Media Center event on Thursday.  “What are they getting and how long are they getting it?” asked Moonves, whose company is not a Hulu owner or content provider. “Are they buying two years of programs for $2 billion? I don’t know. I shouldn’t say more, I’ll get in trouble.”  The issue of rights, particularly on newer platforms such as the Web and mobile, are both unclear and complicated, adding to the potential deal’s complexity.  BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said a recent decision by NBC Universal to offer programs for free via an iPhone and iPad app without requiring a cable subscription effectively undermines the value of the rights Hulu’s owners are trying to sell. The move also potentially conflicts with News Corp unit Fox TV’s strategy of allowing Hulu users to access only the latest TV shows if they are a pay-TV subscriber.  “It gets more challenging to push through the Hulu sale, given what NBC just did,” said Greenfield.  Comcast agreed, as part of the regulatory restrictions attached to its takeover of NBCU, that NBCU would abstain from key management decisions at Hulu.  If the sale falls apart, it will mark the second time its owners have fashioned a full or partial exit strategy that has failed. After nearly six months of planning, the owners ditched an initial public offering last December to raise up to $300 million. Such an IPO would have valued the company at about $2 billion.  But the decision to ditch the IPO in favor of a sale prompted industry observers to wonder whether media companies should risk handing over their future online to digital rivals such as Google and Amazon. Greenfield has described the plan to sell Hulu as a mistake of “epic proportions.”  “Hulu appears to be the perfect weapon for networks and content creators to embrace so they can grow revenues and profits, even if the current multichannel ecosystem becomes unglued over the next decade,” said Greenfield in his client-targeted blog.

181,DIS,"""Mad Men"" tries to fend off ""Boardwalk"" at Emmys","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Television’s “Mad Men” went to the Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, hoping to fend off the Prohibition-era gangsters of “Boardwalk Empire” and win a fourth straight victory at the industry’s top honors.  “Glee” star Chris Colfer, Christina Hendricks of “Mad Men” and Joel McHale of “Community” were among early arrivals on a red carpet packed with diamond jewelry and glorious gowns in shades of coral and pink.  More than 20 Emmys will be handed out in the live telecast on the Fox network hosted by “Glee” star Jane Lynch, who could find herself accepting an early award for her supporting actress role as a sarcastic cheerleading coach on the hit musical comedy.  But all eyes will be on the top prizes — for best comedy and drama series to be handed out at the end of the three-hour ceremony — and some major upsets could be in store, especially in the acting categories.  ABC mockumentary and 2010 Emmy comedy series winner “Modern Family” goes into Sunday’s awards with 17 nominations, including acting mentions for all six of its stars.  That puts it in a commanding position for a repeat victory over rivals “Glee,” “The Office,” “Parks and Recreation” and “The Big Bang Theory.”  The contest for best drama is much closer. HBO’s lavish new show “Boardwalk Empire,” with 18 nominations, has already taken Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild trophies and is regarded as a major contender, despite the 19 nods to “Mad Men,” the 1960s advertising drama on AMC.  Medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones,” which proved a surprise success for HBO, has an army of fans, while CBS lawyer show “The Good Wife” starring Julianna Margulies topped an Xfinity TV poll on Facebook as favorite drama. “Dexter” and “Friday Night Lights” make up the other drama contenders.  ACTORS & ACTRESSES  Margulies also is the front-runner for best dramatic actress, along with Elisabeth Moss, who plays the quiet but feisty young Peggy Olson of “Mad Men.”  “It is such a great showcase for Moss.

182,DIS,"UPDATE 1-""Mad Men"" tries to fend off ""Boardwalk"" at Emmys"," * Miniseries “Mildred Pierce” leads with 21 nominations   * Close races in best drama series, drama acting  (Updates with red carpet arrivals)   By Jill Serjeant   LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Television’s “Mad Men” went to the Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, hoping to fend off the Prohibition-era gangsters of “Boardwalk Empire” and win a fourth straight victory at the industry’s top honors.   “Glee” star Chris Colfer, Christina Hendricks of “Mad Men” and Joel McHale of “Community” were among early arrivals on a red carpet packed with diamond jewelry and glorious gowns in shades of coral and pink.   More than 20 Emmys will be handed out in the live telecast on the Fox network hosted by “Glee” star Jane Lynch, who could find herself accepting an early award for her supporting actress role as a sarcastic cheerleading coach on the hit musical comedy.   But all eyes will be on the top prizes — for best comedy and drama series to be handed out at the end of the three-hour ceremony — and some major upsets could be in store, especially in the acting categories.   ABC mockumentary and 2010 Emmy comedy series winner “Modern Family” goes into Sunday’s awards with 17 nominations, including acting mentions for all six of its stars.   That puts it in a commanding position for a repeat victory over rivals “Glee,” “The Office,” “Parks and Recreation” and “The Big Bang Theory.”   The contest for best drama is much closer. HBO’s lavish new show “Boardwalk Empire,” with 18 nominations, has already taken Golden Globe and Screen Actor’s Guild trophies and is regarded as a major contender, despite the 19 nods to “Mad Men,” the 1960s advertising drama on AMC.   Medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones,” which proved a surprise success for HBO, has an army of fans, while CBS lawyer show “The Good Wife” starring Julianna Margulies topped an Xfinity TV poll on Facebook as favorite drama. “Dexter” and “Friday Night Lights” make up the other drama contenders.   ACTORS & ACTRESSES   Margulies also is the front-runner for best dramatic actress, along with Elisabeth Moss, who plays the quiet but feisty young Peggy Olson of “Mad Men.”   “It is such a great showcase for Moss. It is quite a contest. I think Margulies will win, but it is very close,” said Tom O’Neil of awards website TheEnvelope.com.

183,DIS,"3-D ""Lion King"" reigns at top of movie box office","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “The Lion King” is back on top of the movie jungle seventeen years after the film first hit theaters.  A 3-D version of the 1994 Walt Disney Co animated classic reclaimed the box office throne with a strong $29.3 million in domestic ticket sales over the weekend, studio estimates released on Sunday showed.  The three-day total for North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters was more than double studio forecasts and easily pushed thriller “Contagion,” last weekend’s winner, to second place.  “The Lion King” is one of the most successful animated films of all time, grossing $784 million at theaters worldwide before the 3-D debut. It also reigns as the top-performing home entertainment release ever. The film tells the story of a lion cub named Simba who returns from exile to claim the kingdom once led by his father.  The re-release appealed to parents and grandparents who saw the film years ago and brought their children and grandchildren to see it in a new format, said Dave Hollis, executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution at Disney, linking it to the movie’s “circle of life” theme.  “I’m very pleasantly surprised” with the opening weekend success, Hollis said, adding that Disney will consider extending the movie’s run beyond the planned two-week limited engagement.  Hollis said 92 percent of filmgoers opted to see the new 3D version. Theaters also showed the film in traditional 2D. The film collected an average of $12,575 per theater in 2,330 theaters.  The movie has rung up another $12 million since the 3D version was released in international markets a month ago.  A 3-D Blu-ray disc is set for release next month.  Thriller “Contagion,” a Steven Soderbergh-directed film about the race to stop a deadly virus as it circles the globe, finished second with $14.5 million. The movie’s sales dropped 35 percent from a week earlier and averaged $4,494 at 3,222 theaters.  Action flick “Drive,” starring Ryan Gosling, performed best among other new releases. The story of a Hollywood stunt performer who drives a getaway car for criminal landed third with $11 million domestically, hitting the low end of the studio’s expectations.  The film won strong reviews from critics and appealed to young males as well as “older and upscale audiences,” said Bob Berney, president of theatrical distribution of FilmDistrict, which released “Drive.”  Fourth place went to “The Help,” a drama about the relationships between white women and black maids in civil rights-era Mississippi, with $6.4 million. The domestic tally since the critics favorite opened six weeks ago reached $147.4 million, far exceeding early expectations.  Two newcomers struggled to draw audiences.  Thriller “Straw Dogs,” about a Hollywood screenwriter who finds trouble after relocating to his wife’s hometown, landed in fifth place with $5 million. The remake of a 1971 movie stars James Marsden, Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard.  Romantic comedy “I Don’t Know How She Does It,” starring Sarah Jessica Parker as a multi-tasking mom juggling her family and career as a finance executive, finished sixth with a disappointing $4.5 million domestically. Many movie-going moms likely opted to bring their kids to “The Lion King” instead, said Erik Lomis, president of distribution for The Weinstein Co.  “The Help” was produced by DreamWorks and released by Disney.

After months of anticipation, the stars and creators of dozens of comedies and dramas gather in Los Angeles for the annual Prime-time Emmy Awards ceremony that celebrates the best of television.

187,DIS,"Emmy viewers down, mixed reviews for host Jane Lynch","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Viewership for the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards fell 8 percent from last year to just over 12 million Americans who watched Jane Lynch host the heavily promoted TV show that drew mixed critical reviews.  According to preliminary viewing figures from media research company Nielsen, 12.4 million people watched the three-hour show, down from 13.5 million last year when the Emmys were moved to avoid competition from popular football games.  If the early results hold up, that would make Sunday’s Emmys on Fox one of the least viewed telecasts of the past five years. The show put on by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which gives awards for programs and performances, received its lowest ever audience in 2008 when 12.2 million Americans tuned in.  Time magazine blogger James Poniewozik described Lynch, who won an Emmy last year for her acid-tongued cheerleader coach role in “Glee”, as “game” in her hosting duties but said she “had only occasionally good material to work with.”  Hollywood paper Variety, on the other hand, said Lynch proved an inspired choice both in her off-the-cuff remarks and in videotaped sketches that skewered some of the biggest stars and shows on U.S. television.  “It may come as small comfort to Fox on a night when its shows failed to earn a single win, but the network knows how to throw a helluva of an Emmy Awards,” wrote Variety’s Andrew Wallenstein.  Entertainment Weekly’s Ken Tucker called Lynch a “spunky, clever host”. But for many critics, the best thing about the show was the touching moments when newcomers came up to the stage for the first time.  Six of the eight main acting awards went to Emmy first-timers, including Kyle Chandler for “Friday Night Lights”, Julie Bowen and Ty Burell for “Modern Family, and popular winner Melissa McCarthy for comedy “Mike & Molly.”  McCarthy’s beauty pageant-style “crowning” and the impromptu lining up on stage of all six comedy actress nominees was seen as one of the highlights of Sunday’s ceremony.  Advertising drama “Mad Men” and “Modern Family” took the top prizes again for best drama and comedy series.  Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said “the host and the surprises kept things pleasant if not scintillating.”  But Washington Post’s Hank Stuever felt the show lacked originality, saying “the year’s ‘biggest night in television’ fell flat in writing, performance and imagination, except in the most fleeting moments.”  (Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Bob Tourtellotte)  ",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-emmys-viewers/emmy-viewers-down-mixed-reviews-for-host-jane-lynch-idUSTRE78I4D020110919

190,DIS,Hulu sale at risk even as new bids are due,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The auction of online video site Hulu has been slowed by recent developments which could derail it completely, according to sources familiar with the process.  Among the issues are conflicts over complicated digital rights, a wide bid-ask gap, and Yahoo being sidelined as a potential buyer by its own issues. Moreover, NBC Universal’s hiring of Morgan Stanley banker Stuart Epstein, who was involved in the sale process for the bank, as its chief financial officer complicates a potential deal.  And then there is the lack of commitment to sell by Hulu’s owners — News Corp, Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and Providence Equity Partners.  News Corp Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey even acknowledged during the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month that a Hulu sale might not happen.  A new round of bids are due next week and price will be in a key issue in whether the auction moves forward, according to a source close to the situation.  Other sources with knowledge of the talks said an unusually wide gap has developed in recent weeks between the price bidders are offering and what the Hulu owners are willing to accept. Hulu’s owners are becoming more steadfast about the price and feel enough strategic alternatives are available to reject low-ball offers, sources said.  Bids have ranged from as low as $500 million to as much as $2 billion. The most serious suitors include Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc, DirecTV Group Inc and DISH Network Corp.  Yahoo Inc had been viewed as one of the most enthusiastic likely bidders, but that was before its leadership imploded last week with the firing of CEO Carol Bartz. The company is likely to be too preoccupied with its own issues to digest a multibillion dollar deal. Moreover, Hulu’s owners would be reluctant to sell to a company undergoing an internal upheaval.  As with any sale, the situation is fluid and there remains a chance Google or another party could swoop in with a rich offer. Reports have suggested Google was planning an offer, but company insiders are uncertain Hulu’s media owners would sanction a sale to the search engine giant — at least not without caveats such as blocking piracy searches, for example.  After intense initial interest due to Hulu’s huge and growing popularity, the sale has stalled as bidders questioned what they would get for their money.  One senior media executive said the nature of Hulu’s content deals is key to whether a deal happens or not.  “I guess the brand and technology are worth something, but probably not for that asking price because digital companies could develop a site on their own,” the executive said, who asked not to be identified speaking about a partner company.  CBS Corp boss Les Moonves openly questioned Hulu’s value during an interview at a Paley Media Center event on Thursday.  “What are they getting and how long are they getting it?” asked Moonves, whose company is not a Hulu owner or content provider. “Are they buying two years of programs for $2 billion? I don’t know. I shouldn’t say more, I’ll get in trouble.”  The issue of rights, particularly on newer platforms such as the Web and mobile, are both unclear and complicated, adding to the potential deal’s complexity.  BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said a recent decision by NBC Universal to offer programs for free via an iPhone and iPad app without requiring a cable subscription effectively undermines the value of the rights Hulu’s owners are trying to sell. The move also potentially conflicts with News Corp unit Fox TV’s strategy of allowing Hulu users to access only the latest TV shows if they are a pay-TV subscriber.  “It gets more challenging to push through the Hulu sale, given what NBC just did,” said Greenfield.  Comcast agreed, as part of the regulatory restrictions attached to its takeover of NBCU, that NBCU would abstain from key management decisions at Hulu.  If the sale falls apart, it will mark the second time its owners have fashioned a full or partial exit strategy that has failed. After nearly six months of planning, the owners ditched an initial public offering last December to raise up to $300 million. Such an IPO would have valued the company at about $2 billion. [nN06205589]  But the decision to ditch the IPO in favor of a sale prompted industry observers to wonder whether media companies should risk handing over their future online to digital rivals such as Google and Amazon. Greenfield has described the plan to sell Hulu as a mistake of “epic proportions.”  “Hulu appears to be the perfect weapon for networks and content creators to embrace so they can grow revenues and profits, even if the current multichannel ecosystem becomes unglued over the next decade,” said Greenfield in his client-targeted blog.

Moreover, NBC Universal’s hiring of Morgan Stanley banker Stuart Epstein, who was involved in the sale process for the bank, as its chief financial officer complicates a potential deal.   And then there is the lack of commitment to sell by Hulu’s owners — News Corp (NWSA.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBC Universal and Providence Equity Partners.   News Corp Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey even acknowledged during the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month that a Hulu sale might not happen.   A new round of bids are due next week and price will be in a key issue in whether the auction moves forward, according to a source close to the situation.   Other sources with knowledge of the talks said an unusually wide gap has developed in recent weeks between the price bidders are offering and what the Hulu owners are willing to accept. Hulu’s owners are becoming more steadfast about the price and feel enough strategic alternatives are available to reject low-ball offers, sources said.   Bids have ranged from as low as $500 million to as much as $2 billion. The most serious suitors include Google Inc (GOOG.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), DirecTV Group Inc DTV.O and DISH Network Corp (DISH.O).   Yahoo Inc YHOO.O had been viewed as one of the most enthusiastic likely bidders, but that was before its leadership imploded last week with the firing of CEO Carol Bartz. The company is likely to be too preoccupied with its own issues to digest a multibillion dollar deal. Moreover, Hulu’s owners would be reluctant to sell to a company undergoing an internal upheaval.   As with any sale, the situation is fluid and there remains a chance Google or another party could swoop in with a rich offer. Reports have suggested Google was planning an offer, but company insiders are uncertain Hulu’s media owners would sanction a sale to the search engine giant — at least not without caveats such as blocking piracy searches, for example.   After intense initial interest due to Hulu’s huge and growing popularity, the sale has stalled as bidders questioned what they would get for their money.   One senior media executive said the nature of Hulu’s content deals is key to whether a deal happens or not.   “I guess the brand and technology are worth something, but probably not for that asking price because digital companies could develop a site on their own,” the executive said, who asked not to be identified speaking about a partner company.   CBS Corp (CBS.N) boss Les Moonves openly questioned Hulu’s value during an interview at a Paley Media Center event on Thursday.   “What are they getting and how long are they getting it?” asked Moonves, whose company is not a Hulu owner or content provider. “Are they buying two years of programs for $2 billion? I don’t know. I shouldn’t say more, I’ll get in trouble.”   The issue of rights, particularly on newer platforms such as the Web and mobile, are both unclear and complicated, adding to the potential deal’s complexity.   BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said a recent decision by NBC Universal to offer programs for free via an iPhone and iPad app without requiring a cable subscription effectively undermines the value of the rights Hulu’s owners are trying to sell. The move also potentially conflicts with News Corp unit Fox TV’s strategy of allowing Hulu users to access only the latest TV shows if they are a pay-TV subscriber.   “It gets more challenging to push through the Hulu sale, given what NBC just did,” said Greenfield.   Comcast agreed, as part of the regulatory restrictions attached to its takeover of NBCU, that NBCU would abstain from key management decisions at Hulu.   If the sale falls apart, it will mark the second time its owners have fashioned a full or partial exit strategy that has failed. After nearly six months of planning, the owners ditched an initial public offering last December to raise up to $300 million. Such an IPO would have valued the company at about $2 billion. [nN06205589]   But the decision to ditch the IPO in favor of a sale prompted industry observers to wonder whether media companies should risk handing over their future online to digital rivals such as Google and Amazon. Greenfield has described the plan to sell Hulu as a mistake of “epic proportions.”   “Hulu appears to be the perfect weapon for networks and content creators to embrace so they can grow revenues and profits, even if the current multichannel ecosystem becomes unglued over the next decade,” said Greenfield in his client-targeted blog.

194,DIS,"UPDATE 5-'Mad Men', 'Modern Family' win Emmys but shocks abound"," * “Mad Men” makes it four. “Modern Family” best comedy   * First time wins for Kyle Chandler, Melissa McCarthy   * Disappointing night for “Glee”  (Recasts at end of awards show)   By Jill Serjeant   LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters) - “Mad Men” and “Modern Family” won television’s top drama and comedy prizes again on Sunday but elsewhere it was out with the old and in with the new at the Primetime Emmy Awards.   On a night of surprises that brought a slew of newcomers to the Emmy podium, “Mad Men” won best drama series for a fourth straight year but the waiting got tense as the 1960s advertising drama lost out in all the acting, writing and directing races.   “I did not think that was going to happen,” creator Matthew Weiner said, accepting the best drama series trophy. “Mad Men” went home with just two Emmys — including one from last week’s creative arts ceremony — even though it came into the awards show with 19 nominations.   “We were shut out, but then we also won this (best drama) award so it balances out. To me this is the prize that says people love what we are doing,” Weiner said backstage.   The story was different for “Modern Family.” Along with its best comedy win, the ABC mockumentary about three assorted couples and their children brought first-time wins for Julie Bowen and her screen husband Ty Burrell in the supporting acting slots, and Emmys for directing and writing.   Creator Steve Levitan called the wins “an embarrassment of riches” while actor Ed O’Neill said “it was better than the first time. To repeat is difficult. I am relieved.”   “Welcome back to the ‘Modern Family’ awards!” Emmy ceremony host Jane Lynch quipped early in the evening.   Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet won her first Emmy for her lead role in the HBO miniseries “Mildred Pierce.” But the British period show “Downton Abbey,” shown on PBS, was the miniseries winner, giving it a total of six Emmys overall.   “I didn’t think we were going to win anything!” Winslet said.   Elsewhere, a host of new faces took home Emmys in a night that defied most predictions.   The little-seen but critically admired football drama “Friday Night Lights” won for best writing and its star Kyle Chandler beat favorites Jon Hamm and Steve Buscemi for best dramatic actor.   Melissa McCarthy won lead comedy actress at her first shot for the CBS romantic comedy “Mike & Molly,” in which she plays an overweight teacher.   Emmy rookie Peter Dinklage won for his turn as the clever but rude Tyrion in HBO’s popular medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones,” while Margo Martindale was an emotional first-time winner for her supporting actress role in FX drama “Justified,” which came to the veteran actress after more than 20 years in the business.   Julianna Margulies, star of “The Good Wife” on CBS, won the race for best dramatic actress. Jim Parsons was a rare repeat winner for comedy “The Big Bang Theory” in a category that most pundits had thought would finally go to departing “The Office” star Steve Carell.   “I am really flabbergasted. I am more shocked this year,” Parsons told reporters backstage.   Jaw-dropping moments were not only reserved for the winners.   Fox musical comedy “Glee” — one of the most talked about shows of the last two years — won just two Emmys, both in creative arts categories, while HBO’s lavish “Boardwalk Empire” won seven of its eight total Emmys in last week’s technical awards section. Its only win on Sunday night went to director Martin Scorsese.   HBO was the biggest network winner with 19 Emmys, followed by 14 for PBS, 11 for CBS, nine for Fox, eight for ABC and six for NBC.   Among the show’s highlights was a smiling and apparently sincere Charlie Sheen, on the comeback trail after months of erratic behavior that resulted in his firing from CBS hit “Two and A Half Men.” He was a last minute addition as a presenter.   “From the bottom of my heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season,” Sheen said of his former program that previously this year he had sharply criticized.   “American Idol” — the most-watched show on U.S. television for the past seven years — was left empty-handed again in the reality competition show race, which was won by long-running Emmy favorite “The Amazing Race.”  (Editing by Eric Beech and Bob Tourtellotte)    ",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/emmys/update-5-mad-men-modern-family-win-emmys-but-shocks-abound-idUSS1E78H07D20110919

197,DIS,"Disney, Cameron to create theme-park ""Avatar""","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Moviegoers pining for a return to the lush moon of Pandora in James Cameron’s film “Avatar” will finally get their chance — first-hand.  Walt Disney Co is teaming with the Oscar-winning director and News Corp unit Fox Filmed Entertainment, to mimic the thriving green landscape depicted in the highest-grossing movie of all time in a section of its Orlando, Florida, theme park.  Under their agreement, Disney won exclusive global theme park rights to the “Avatar” franchise. It will begin building from 2013 and will eventually take Avatar “lands” beyond Orlando’s Disney World.  “Our goal is to go beyond current boundaries of technical innovation and experiential storytelling, and give park-goers the chance to see, hear and touch the world of ‘Avatar’ with an  unprecedented sense of reality,” Cameron said in a statement.  At a news conference, Cameron said that when he began talks with Disney designers, he “quickly realized their vision for this thing was far beyond what I imagined, and I’ve got a pretty good imagination.”  The estimated cost for the Orlando project is about $400 million, a source familiar with the matter said. Construction should take about five years.  Planning is in the early stages, and executives gave few details on how Disney would recreate the fantasy world of “Avatar” and the creatures that inhabit it. The section will be located within Disney’s Animal Kingdom park.  “Avatar,” the 2009 film that chronicled the struggle of the alien Na’vi against marauding resource-ravenous humans, grossed almost $3 billion worldwide and triggered the current renaissance in 3D-film making. Cameron is planning sequels to the blockbuster hit, which surpassed his own “Titanic” as the highest-grossing movie in history.  The first of the “Avatar” sequels is set for release around Christmas 2014, Cameron said.  Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company planned to bring “Avatar” to other locations beyond the Florida park. “We think we can clearly leverage the global interest in this property,” Iger said.  The company is deep into several big theme park projects, including building a new park in Shanghai and adding a 12-acre section, set to open next year based on the animated “Cars” films, to its California resort.  Disney typically works with its own movies when developing themed sections and rides. It does have some attractions based on films from other studios, including the “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” franchises.

199,DIS,News Corp share buyback crosses $1 billion mark,"(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp (NWSA.O) bought back more than $1 billion of its shares in the last month, according to a filing, as it seeks to improve relations with shareholders frustrated by what they say is the media company’s unpredictable capital allocation strategy.  Filings show News Corp, which owns Fox TV, Twentieth Century Fox studios, The Wall Street Journal and The Sun in the United Kingdom, bought back more than 65.6 million Class A shares at between $15.64 and $17.34 in the period from August 15 to September 18.  News Corp shares have risen about 10 percent since July 12, when it announced it would buy back $5 billion in stock over 12 months.  Murdoch’s decision to pursue the aggressive buyback strategy was confirmed a day before the company announced it would drop its controversial bid to take full control of UK satellite TV operator BSkyB BSY.L in the wake of a phone tapping scandal at its UK newspaper unit.  News Corp shares typically trade below the valuations of media conglomerate rivals such as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). This is because investors take into account a “Murdoch discount” — a reference to Murdoch’s control and a tendency to make decisions shareholders might not support.  Wall Street analysts and investors have welcomed the aggressive buyback and are hoping for more.  “Based on the pace of the repurchases, we expect News Corp to increase authorization for more, possibly by the end of the year,” said Collins Stewart analyst Thomas Eagan, who rates News Corp a ‘buy’ with a $25 price target.  “News Corp trades at a discount to its peers because investors feel management isn’t shareholder friendly. With this aggressive buyback, they are gradually ameliorating those concerns.”  The buyback during the current quarter, which ends September 30 is already the largest in News Corp’s history, according to BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.

202,DIS,"Exclusive: Facebook seeks exec to build Hollywood, media ties","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook is looking to hire a big-name executive to cultivate relationships and strike deals with the film and music industries to bolster its media offerings.  In recent months, Facebook had discussions with former MySpace co-President and former MTV executive Jason Hirschhorn about a job spearheading the company’s outreach to media companies, according to several people familiar with the situation.  While the talks do not appear to have gone anywhere, and it wasn’t clear whether Facebook had approached others about the position, the efforts signal Facebook’s intention to take a more hands-on approach in helping media companies bring their content to the social network.  “They had held the media industry at arm’s length for a while. It was: ‘We are a platform, come use us all you want but we don’t necessarily need to partner with you.’ But now the attitude has changed,” said one of the people familiar with the situation.  “They realize that one of the next phases in its evolution is to work with the media companies,” the person added.  Facebook and Hirschhorn both declined to comment.  Facebook’s media push comes as the company faces fresh competition from Google Inc, which launched a rival social networking service in June.  Twitter recruited former Creative Artists Agency executive Omid Ashtari to be its “L.A. person” last November, according to a report in AllThingsD.com, and the company recently appointed Chloe Sladden to a new role overseeing content and programing efforts.  “The view is they’re looking at Twitter and Google and their outreach to the media community and they don’t want to fall behind the curve,” the source said. “They don’t want the media companies to think they’re uninterested.”  Facebook has gradually gotten closer to the media world, with Chief Operating Office Sheryl Sandberg joining the Walt Disney Co board of directors in December 2009, and Netflix Inc Chief Executive Reed Hastings taking a seat on Facebook’s board in June.  Several movie studios have released movies that can be rented and viewed on Facebook this year, including Warner Brothers’ “Dark Knight” and Universal Pictures’ “Big Lebowski.”  Facebook was aggressively exploring recruiting a media point-person a few months ago, but has since shifted its attention to other strategic priorities, the sources said. But with the company increasingly interested in making media a key part of the social network, people expect the search to pick up again soon.  Facebook’s media ambitions will be on display on Thursday at its annual developer conference in San Francisco, where the company is expected to unveil new music features.  The music platform will integrate streaming music services from companies including Spotify, Rhapsody and Rdio, directly into users’ home pages, said several other people familiar with the situation. Facebook users who subscribe to the music services will be able to share songs and playlists with each other and see what their friends are listening to, the people said.  Facebook will also unveil new flavors of its “Like” button at the event, allowing users to flag Web pages or other online content with specific recommendations, such as “Read,” “Watched” or “Listened,” according to a source with knowledge of the matter.  For Facebook, building a deeper integration with music, movies and other media into its service makes it more likely that users will spend more time on its site, allowing the company to generate more advertising dollars.  Media also fits well with Facebook Credits, the payment system that Facebook has introduced for its users to buy digital goods on its site. Facebook takes a 30 percent cut of transactions using Facebook Credits.  The template for Facebook’s media push is social games, which more than 200 million of its users play on the website every month. Companies like Zynga and Electronic Arts Inc’s Playfish have built successful businesses developing social games that can be played on Facebook.  But recreating that magic with the media industry could be trickier.  While technology-savvy social game companies are adept at quickly creating products that shine on various “platforms,” such as social networks or smartphone applications, traditional content providers don’t possess the same kinds of expertise, said another person familiar with the situation.  “You can’t just drop platforms in Hollywood,” the person said.  “They make content well,” he said. But, he noted, creating media that really shines on a social networking platform requires hand-holding.

203,DIS,Hulu has more than 1 million paying subscribers: CEO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hulu, the popular online video service which has been put up for sale by its joint owners, now has more than 1 million paying subscribers, Chief Executive Jason Kilar said on Wednesday.  Earlier this year Kilar forecast that Hulu would have 1 million subscribers by the end of the year. He confirmed that it reached that milestone at the end of the summer and the site is now on its way to easily exceed that number by year’s end.  The site made its name as a free service for popular broadcast TV shows like The Office and Modern Family soon after the shows had been aired.  The shows and movies it initially featured were supplied by its joint equity owners News Corp, Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal. Its fourth co-owner is private equity firm Providence Equity Partners.  Hulu launched a subscription tier last November and has since added more content from partners including Viacom and Hollywood studio Miramax.  Kilar said customers’ preference for TV shows and library content on Hulu and Netflix Inc is a function of the deals the sites are able to reach with programmers within the constraints of their respective financial models.  “We will invest over $375 million in content this year,” said Kilar, speaking at a Goldman Sachs investor conference.  Kilar has previously said the company will have around $500 million in revenue this year.  Some programmers have been reluctant to do major U.S. deals with Hulu due to concerns that it might undercut their relationships with pay-TV distributors.

204,DIS,UPDATE 1-Hulu has more than 1 mln paying subs - CEO," * Hulu had 1 mln paying subs at end of summer - CEO   * Will spend $375 million on content this year - CEO   * Hulu sale still being evaluated - News Corp COO Carey   By Yinka Adegoke   NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Hulu, the popular online video service which has been put up for sale by its joint owners, now has more than 1 million paying subscribers, Chief Executive Jason Kilar said on Wednesday.   Earlier this year Kilar forecast that Hulu would have 1 million subscribers by the end of the year. He confirmed that it reached that milestone at the end of the summer and the site is now on its way to easily exceed that number by year’s end.   The site made its name as a free service for popular broadcast TV shows like The Office and Modern Family soon after the shows had been aired.   The shows and movies it initially featured were supplied by its joint equity owners News Corp (NWSA.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBC Universal. Its fourth co-owner is private equity firm Providence Equity Partners.   Hulu launched a subscription tier last November and has since added more content from partners including Viacom VIAb.N and Hollywood studio Miramax.   Kilar said customers’ preference for TV shows and library content on Hulu and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is a function of the deals the sites are able to reach with programmers within the constraints of their respective financial models.   “We will invest over $375 million in content this year,” said Kilar, speaking at a Goldman Sachs investor conference.   Kilar has previously said the company will have around $500 million in revenue this year.   Some programmers have been reluctant to do major U.S. deals with Hulu due to concerns that it might undercut their relationships with pay-TV distributors. CBS Corp (CBS.N) boss Les Moonves in particular has been the most vocal about his caution with Hulu, even though his company inked a deal with Hulu in Japan.   “I’m cautiously optimistic that we’ll work with everyone over time,” Kilar said.

205,DIS,"Exclusive: Facebook seeks exec to build Hollywood, media ties","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook is looking to hire a big-name executive to cultivate relationships and strike deals with the film and music industries to bolster its media offerings.  In recent months, Facebook had discussions with former MySpace co-President and former MTV executive Jason Hirschhorn about a job spearheading the company’s outreach to media companies, according to several people familiar with the situation.  While the talks do not appear to have gone anywhere, and it wasn’t clear whether Facebook had approached others about the position, the efforts signal Facebook’s intention to take a more hands-on approach in helping media companies bring their content to the social network.  “They had held the media industry at arm’s length for a while. It was: ‘We are a platform, come use us all you want but we don’t necessarily need to partner with you.’ But now the attitude has changed,” said one of the people familiar with the situation.  “They realize that one of the next phases in its evolution is to work with the media companies,” the person added.  Facebook and Hirschhorn both declined to comment.  Facebook’s media push comes as the company faces fresh competition from Google Inc, which launched a rival social networking service in June.  Twitter recruited former Creative Artists Agency executive Omid Ashtari to be its “L.A. person” last November, according to a report in AllThingsD.com, and the company recently appointed Chloe Sladden to a new role overseeing content and programing efforts.  “The view is they’re looking at Twitter and Google and their outreach to the media community and they don’t want to fall behind the curve,” the source said. “They don’t want the media companies to think they’re uninterested.”  Facebook has gradually gotten closer to the media world, with Chief Operating Office Sheryl Sandberg joining the Walt Disney Co board of directors in December 2009, and Netflix Inc Chief Executive Reed Hastings taking a seat on Facebook’s board in June.  Several movie studios have released movies that can be rented and viewed on Facebook this year, including Warner Brothers’ “Dark Knight” and Universal Pictures’ “Big Lebowski.”  Facebook was aggressively exploring recruiting a media point-person a few months ago, but has since shifted its attention to other strategic priorities, the sources said. But with the company increasingly interested in making media a key part of the social network, people expect the search to pick up again soon.  Facebook’s media ambitions will be on display on Thursday at its annual developer conference in San Francisco, where the company is expected to unveil new music features.  The music platform will integrate streaming music services from companies including Spotify, Rhapsody and Rdio, directly into users’ home pages, said several other people familiar with the situation. Facebook users who subscribe to the music services will be able to share songs and playlists with each other and see what their friends are listening to, the people said.  Facebook will also unveil new flavors of its “Like” button at the event, allowing users to flag Web pages or other online content with specific recommendations, such as “Read,” “Watched” or “Listened,” according to a source with knowledge of the matter.  For Facebook, building a deeper integration with music, movies and other media into its service makes it more likely that users will spend more time on its site, allowing the company to generate more advertising dollars.  Media also fits well with Facebook Credits, the payment system that Facebook has introduced for its users to buy digital goods on its site. Facebook takes a 30 percent cut of transactions using Facebook Credits.  The template for Facebook’s media push is social games, which more than 200 million of its users play on the website every month. Companies like Zynga and Electronic Arts Inc’s Playfish have built successful businesses developing social games that can be played on Facebook.  But recreating that magic with the media industry could be trickier.  While technology-savvy social game companies are adept at quickly creating products that shine on various “platforms,” such as social networks or smartphone applications, traditional content providers don’t possess the same kinds of expertise, said another person familiar with the situation.  “You can’t just drop platforms in Hollywood,” the person said.  “They make content well,” he said. But, he noted, creating media that really shines on a social networking platform requires hand-holding.

206,DIS,"Disney, Cameron to create theme-park ""Avatar""","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Moviegoers pining for a return to the lush moon of Pandora in James Cameron’s film “Avatar” will finally get their chance — first-hand.  Walt Disney Co is teaming with the Oscar-winning director and News Corp unit Fox Filmed Entertainment, to mimic the thriving green landscape depicted in the highest-grossing movie of all time in a section of its Orlando, Florida, theme park.  Under their agreement, Disney won exclusive global theme park rights to the “Avatar” franchise. It will begin building from 2013 and will eventually take Avatar “lands” beyond Orlando’s Disney World.  “Our goal is to go beyond current boundaries of technical innovation and experiential storytelling, and give park-goers the chance to see, hear and touch the world of ‘Avatar’ with an unprecedented sense of reality,” Cameron said in a statement.  At a news conference, Cameron said that when he began talks with Disney designers, he “quickly realized their vision for this thing was far beyond what I imagined, and I’ve got a pretty good imagination.”  The estimated cost for the Orlando project is about $400 million, a source familiar with the matter said. Construction should take about five years.  Planning is in the early stages, and executives gave few details on how Disney would recreate the fantasy world of “Avatar” and the creatures that inhabit it. The section will be located within Disney’s Animal Kingdom park.  “Avatar,” the 2009 film that chronicled the struggle of the alien Na’vi against marauding resource-ravenous humans, grossed almost $3 billion worldwide and triggered the current renaissance in 3D-film making. Cameron is planning sequels to the blockbuster hit, which surpassed his own “Titanic” as the highest-grossing movie in history.  The first of the “Avatar” sequels is set for release around Christmas 2014, Cameron said.  Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company planned to bring “Avatar” to other locations beyond the Florida park. “We think we can clearly leverage the global interest in this property,” Iger said.  The company is deep into several big theme park projects, including building a new park in Shanghai and adding a 12-acre section, set to open next year based on the animated “Cars” films, to its California resort.  Disney typically works with its own movies when developing themed sections and rides. It does have some attractions based on films from other studios, including the “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” franchises.

208,DIS,Angry HP investors seen having thin legal case,"(Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co directors may have embarrassed themselves by keeping former Chief Executive Leo Apotheker on the job for less than a year, but the board is unlikely to face serious legal action from shareholders angry over its drooping stock price.  Legal experts said directors are generally protected from making bad decisions that were done in good faith, so any shareholder lawsuit related to the executive shake-up likely would be a stretch. In addition, showing the door to the CEO of a company with a plummeting stock price is generally considered a sign of a responsive board.  Hewlett-Packard said on Thursday it removed Apotheker because the company needed a leader with “additional attributes” to implement the company’s strategy.  The company’s board is already facing several shareholder lawsuits. One stems from the resignation of Mark Hurd, who quit following a company investigation into sexual harassment allegations that revealed falsified expense reports.  Shareholders have also sued over allegations of bribery by current and former Hewlett-Packard employees in Europe.  Legal experts predict there may be new cases, or some existing cases may be amended, to include recent claims by shareholders that the board fell down on its duty in overseeing management. The shareholders could argue that the board was negligent and is responsible for losses on their stock, which lost nearly half its value over the past year.  “I would be very surprised if more claims are not filed and if some of them don’t get into discovery,” said Christopher Keller, a partner with Labaton Sucharow LLP in New York. Keller is not involved in litigation with Hewlett-Packard.  Hewlett-Packard’s board certainly has plenty of critics. The board could be most vulnerable to claims that it did not properly vet Apotheker. Reuters reported that the full board did not meet with Apotheker before hiring him.  But Delaware, where Hewlett-Packard is incorporated, protects directors from being liable for poor decisions so long as they can prove they were not consciously trying to harm the business.  That standard protected the board of Walt Disney Co when it paid former CEO Michael Ovitz a severance of more than $100 million for less than two years’ work.  The outcome of that case would likely discourage most plaintiffs from bringing a similar case against the board of Hewlett-Packard over Apotheker, according to attorneys.  The fact that so much of the board’s deliberations have spilled into the public suggests that there could be possible claims that board members were fighting each other rather than working for shareholders.  “The fact that all of this is being made public is a sign of breakdown of the cone of silence that most boards operate under,” said Keller.  Still, a case of that type against the board, known as a derivative lawsuit, faces high procedural hurdles.  One legal expert said the failings of Hewlett-Packard’s board shows the need to give investors a bigger role in the process of nominating directors.  A proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission to open that process was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals this year.  That proposal gave “some modest hope of allowing shareholders to take some coordinated action that would save a company like HP from itself,” said James Cox, a professor at Duke Law School.

210,DIS,PREVIEW-Competitors circle around as Netflix stumbles," * Blockbuster to unveil streaming service Friday   * Coinstar’s Redbox kiosks expected to gain   * Tech giants could jump in as Netflix falters   By Lisa Richwine and Rachana Khanzode   LOS ANGELES, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Missteps by Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) have opened the door to competitors to grab disgruntled customers looking for new options for video rentals and instant online streaming.   Blockbuster, the once-dominant video store chain that Netflix pushed into bankruptcy, wants to reclaim its crown as the current king of video rentals struggles. Now a unit of Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), Blockbuster is expected to announce its jump into the streaming market on Friday.   That would better position Blockbuster to compete with Netflix, now facing a subscriber backlash over a price increase for DVD subscribers and pressure from Hollywood studios to pay more for content. The shares of the one-time Wall Street darling have plummeted 50 percent in two months, spurring an apology from CEO Reed Hastings to try to win customers back.   “It’s the right time for Blockbuster,” said Brean Murray analyst Todd Mitchell, who has a “buy” rating on Dish shares. “They are attached to Dish Network and they have distribution.”   Blockbuster is gunning for unhappy Netflix customers with a free-trial offer. The company also advertises that it gets many new movie releases 28 days earlier than Netflix or Coinstar Inc’s (CSTR.O) Redbox kiosks, another competitor that could benefit from Netflix’s missteps.   Netflix sparked anger with a price increase as high as 60 percent, or $6 a month, for some DVD subscribers and by putting the DVD and streaming services on separate websites.   Last week, Netflix cut its subscriber forecast by 1 million, saying it now expects to have 24 million subscribers at the end of the third quarter. The last time Netflix reported a subscriber decline was the second quarter of 2007 when Blockbuster was aggressively pushing a DVD rental package called Total Access.   Redbox looks likely to gain customers from the outrage over the Netflix price increase, which took effect earlier this month, industry analysts said. The $1-per-DVD Redbox price may appeal to customers searching for a cheaper option without a fixed monthly cost, said Merriman Capital analyst Eric Wold, who has a “neutral” rating on Netflix and a “buy” on Coinstar.   While Netflix sees its future in streaming, “low-cost physical (disc) rentals continue to be popular,” said Matthew Lieberman, who studies consumer attitudes toward video content as head of the entertainment, media and communications practice at accounting and consulting firm PwC.   800-POUND GORILLA   Netflix remains the industry heavyweight and has defended its strategy. Chief Financial Officer David Wells told investors on Wednesday the company remained well-positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in the United States and abroad.   On Thursday, the company unveiled a feature that lets subscribers in Canada and Latin America share what they watch on Netflix with friends on Facebook. The feature will not be available in the United States because of a 1980s law the company said created confusion about what information can be legally shared about watching videos.   Looming in the background are other media and technology heavyweights that could make a big push into streaming, and the “for sale” sign hanging on popular online video service Hulu.   Recent Netflix challenges, including higher content costs, “has waken up the idea of competition. A lot of people could do it,” said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst, who has a “sell” rating on Netflix.   Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) has started beefing up its streaming video offerings and is among possible suitors for Hulu alongside Google Inc (GOOG.O), DirecTV Group DIRV.OB and Dish. New bids are due this week, although sources familiar with the process said the auction could be derailed completely. [ID:nS1E78I05R]   Hulu is owned by News Corp (NWSA.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBC Universal and private equity firm Providence Equity Partners.   Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which sells video through iTunes, also could be a strong competitor if it made a big push into the streaming rental market, Morningstar analyst Michael Corty said.   “When you talk competition ... we are in the early stages of that game,” Corty added.

After months of hype and bold predictions by its creator Simon Cowell, just 12.1 million Americans tuned in for the debut of “The X Factor” on Fox — about half the audience for the most recent season of “American Idol”.  Instead, “Modern Family” — the affectionate ABC mockumentary that won big at the Emmy Awards last weekend — drew 14.3 million viewers to make it the most-watched TV show of Wednesday night, early numbers for Nielsen media research showed.  Critics were also mostly underwhelmed by “X Factor”, which Cowell had predicted earlier this year would thrash the competition and replace “Idol” as the most-watched show on U.S. television.  “It quickly becomes clear that this series, which has billed itself as a new type of competition show, really just remixes the well-established gimmicks of the earlier entries in the genre,” wrote Neil Genzlinger of the New York Times.

Wooga’s top titles — Diamond Dash, Bubble Island and Monster World — each have around 10 million active players.  There has been a spate of M&A in the sector, with Electronics Arts acquiring Wooga’s rival PopCap for up to $1.3 billion in July and last year Disney spent $763 million on smaller rival PlayDom.  Zynga, the top maker of Facebook games which has plans for an initial public offering, has been  valued at around $14 billion by third parties in regulatory filings.  Zynga’s IPO plans along with the major acquisitions in the sector have put traditional gaming firms and investors searching for other hot up-and-coming video game publishers like Wooga.  “Everybody in this industry is getting emails from usual suspects,” Begemann said when asked whether Wooga had been approached, but he declined to elaborate.  In May, Wooga raised $24 million from venture capital firms Highland Capital Partners, Tenaya Capital, Balderton Capital and HV Holtzbrinck Ventures. Begemann said there were no plans to raise more during next six months.  Begemann said “low single digits” percentages of players pay for additional features. “Free to play is a big, big trend,” he said.  Zynga has said less than 5 percent of its players generate revenues for the company.  Begemann said in the medium-term Wooga would focus on creating more engaging, more social games, while also rolling out its games for mobile platforms.  “Our users are going mobile,” he said, adding the firm was working on bringing its top title Diamond Dash to Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones and iPads.

Netflix sparked anger with a price increase as high as 60 percent, or $6 a month, for some DVD subscribers and by putting the DVD and streaming services on separate websites.  Last week, Netflix cut its subscriber forecast by 1 million, saying it now expects to have 24 million subscribers at the end of the third quarter. The last time Netflix reported a subscriber decline was the second quarter of 2007 when Blockbuster was aggressively pushing a DVD rental package called Total Access.  Redbox looks likely to gain customers from the outrage over the Netflix price increase, which took effect earlier this month, industry analysts said. The $1-per-DVD Redbox price may appeal to customers searching for a cheaper option without a fixed monthly cost, said Merriman Capital analyst Eric Wold, who has a “neutral” rating on Netflix and a “buy” on Coinstar.  While Netflix sees its future in streaming, “low-cost physical (disc) rentals continue to be popular,” said Matthew Lieberman, who studies consumer attitudes toward video content for the entertainment, media and communications practice at accounting and consulting firm PwC.  A PwC study forecasts that kiosk rentals will grow for two years and then flatten due to rising popularity of video on demand.  800-POUND GORILLA  Netflix remains the industry heavyweight and has defended its strategy. Chief Financial Officer David Wells told investors on Wednesday the company remained well-positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in the United States and abroad.  On Thursday, the company unveiled a feature that lets subscribers in Canada and Latin America share what they watch on Netflix with friends on Facebook. The feature will not be available in the United States because of a 1980s law the company said created confusion about what information can be legally shared about watching videos.  Off stage are other media and technology heavyweights that could make a big push into streaming, and the “for sale” sign hanging on popular online video service Hulu.  Recent Netflix challenges, including higher content costs, “has waken up the idea of competition.

215,DIS,PREVIEW-UPDATE 1-Competitors circle around as Netflix stumbles," * Blockbuster to unveil streaming service Friday   * Coinstar’s Redbox kiosks expected to gain   * Tech giants could jump in as Netflix falters  (Adds details paragraphs 3, 10)   By Lisa Richwine and Rachana Khanzode   LOS ANGELES, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Missteps by Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) have opened the door to competitors seeking to grab disgruntled customers who are looking for new options for video rentals and instant online streaming.   Blockbuster, the once-dominant video store chain that Netflix pushed into bankruptcy, wants to reclaim its crown. Now a unit of Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), Blockbuster is expected to announce its jump into the streaming market on Friday.   That would better position Blockbuster to compete with Netflix, which is now facing a subscriber backlash over a price increase for DVD subscribers and pressure from Hollywood studios to pay more for content.   Shares of the one-time Wall Street darling have plummeted 50 percent in two months. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has apologized for failing to adequately explain his moves, and the company is trying to win customers back.   “It’s the right time for Blockbuster,” said Brean Murray analyst Todd Mitchell, who has a “buy” rating on Dish shares. “They are attached to Dish Network and they have distribution.”   Blockbuster is gunning for unhappy Netflix customers with a free-trial offer.

216,DIS,"3D ""Lion King"" rules box office for second week","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “The Lion King” fended off Brad Pitt to keep the box-office crown for a second straight weekend.  Walt Disney Co’s 3D re-release of the animated classic rang up an estimated $22.1 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales over three days as families turned out to see lion cub Simba’s return to theaters.  Baseball drama “Moneyball” starring Pitt took second and family film “Dolphin Tale” finished a close third, according to studio projections released on Sunday.  Ticket sales for “The Lion King 3D” have far surpassed industry expectations for a movie that debuted in 1994 and will soon hit stores on Blu-ray disc. The film has grossed $61.7 million in North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters since its release last weekend, plus $16 million in international markets, where it came out more than a month ago.  Combined, the “Lion King” re-release has brought in $77.7 million around the world. Disney will extend the planned two-week run in theaters, said Dave Hollis, executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution at Disney.  “We are working to meet that demand,” Hollis said.  Baseball and math didn’t quite add up to a box-office win for “Moneyball,” which finished in second place with $20.6 million domestically. Pitt plays real-life Oakland A’s general manager Billy Beane, who used unconventional statistical analysis to field a small-budget team of overlooked players to make an unlikely playoff run.  The movie won positive reviews from critics and received an A rating from audiences polled by CinemaScore.  The film was based on a nonfiction book by Michael Lewis and cost about $50 million to produce. Sales hit the high end of studio projections, said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Columbia Pictures, which released the film.  Close behind was another story from the animal kingdom. “Dolphin Tale” brought in an estimated $20.3 million to take third place, a strong showing for a family film against the mighty performance from “Lion King.”  The movie, starring Harry Connick Jr., Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman, is based on the true story of a dolphin that loses its tail in a crab trap and is rehabilitated with a prosthetic tail. The real dolphin that inspired the story portrays the dolphin in the film.  The movie won a rare A+ rating from audiences polled by CinemaScore. Also offered in 3D, the film was produced by Alcon Entertainment for about $37 million.  Action film “Abduction,” starring and produced by “Twilight” heartthrob Taylor Lautner in his first major role outside the popular vampire and werewolf series, pulled in $11.2 million to take fourth place.  In “Abduction,” Lautner plays a teenager on the run after he discovers his parents aren’t who he thought they were and his life has been a lie. He pieces together the truth while being pursued by the FBI and killer assassins. The film cost Lions Gate Entertainment about $35 million to make.  Spy thriller “Killer Elite,” starring Robert de Niro, Clive Owen and Jason Stratham, finished in fifth place with $9.5 million. The film is the first movie released by Open Road Films, a joint venture between theater owners Regal Entertainment Group and AMC Entertainment Inc.  The weekend also saw surprise summer hit “The Smurfs” crossing a milestone with more than $500 million in global ticket sales since the 3D live-action and animated family film debuted in July.  Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp, released “Moneyball” and “The Smurfs.” “Dolphin Tale” was released by Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc.

221,DIS,"In switch, cable operators want to go ""a la carte""","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cable operators are privately working on a plan to force programmers to unbundle their networks and allow customers to subscribe to channels on an individual basis.  The plan represents a complete reversal from cable operators’ long-held opposition to what is known as “a la carte” programing. Over the last decade, the cable industry battled ferociously with regulators to protect the right to bundle programing, arguing it offered customers the best value.  But executives now say the change is a necessary response to shifting dynamics such as higher carriage costs and using the Web to watch programs, as well as a weak economic recovery that has forced many consumers to cancel cable television subscriptions.  Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable, the two largest operators have lost 1.2 million video customers in the 12 months to June 30.  Pay-TV distributors such as Time Warner Cable and Cablevision are searching for a business or regulatory strategy to lower escalating programing costs, which have risen between 6 and 10 percent each year during the last decade, according to industry sources.  An “a la carte” menu of programing would give consumers who are not sports fans the freedom to drop high cost sports channels such as Walt Disney Co’s ESPN and ESPN 2 from basic packages. At around $4 a subscriber, ESPN is the most expensive channel in the cable business, according to SNL Kagan.  “We feel that some of those expensive channels should be offered a la carte so only those people who want to watch them actually pay for them,” said Jerry Kent, chief executive of Suddenlink, which has 1.3 million cable customers.  Rocco Commisso, chief executive of Mediacom, which has 1.2 million subscribers, sent a letter to Federal Communications Chairman Julius Genachowski earlier this month that suggested “instituting a carefully designed a la carte system, so that decisions about what video services are bought are made by consumers themselves, rather than by content owners.”  The specter of unbundled programing is likely to encounter fierce resistance from network owners such as Viacom Inc or Discovery Communications Inc, which are keen to maintain the economics of selling their most popular channels as a package with their smaller, nascent networks.  The cable operators’ plan is motivated in part by the high cost of sports programing rights, which have skyrocketed in recent years. ESPN recently singed a $15 billion, 8-year TV rights deal with the National Football League, a 73 percent premium over their previous agreement. Cable operators, fearful of having to pay for the increase or pass it on to customers, harshly criticized the deal.  Cable and satellite companies have also had to start paying for the right to carry Disney’s ABC, CBS Corp’s CBS, Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and News Corp’s Fox. Those free-to-air broadcast networks traditionally had been carried by cable operators at little, if any, expense.  Federal rules require cable distributors to carry local broadcast stations, which they argue gives broadcasters an unfair advantage in contract talks.  The so-called retransmission fee debate has already led to high profile blackouts of local TV stations in the last few years after contract negotiations between pay-TV companies and broadcasters broke down over payment terms.  “There is a growing recognition that the current model is broken,” said Craig Moffett, a long-time cable analyst at Bernstein Research.  Moffett warned, however, that allowing customers to choose any station they wanted in any package would be economically unfeasible for both the consumer and the cable company.  “It could be a la carte, but not as people imagine it now,” he said referring to smaller packs of programing more akin to what Time Warner Cable Inc has tried. Last November, Time Warner Cable launched a three-city trial of a low cost TV Essentials pack with fewer channels. It now plans to expand that offer to other cities.  Following Mediacom’s lead, rivals Time Warner Cable and satellite company DirecTV Group joined forces this month to reach out to Genachowski about retransmission fees, with the aim of unbundling broadcast channels from cable channels in carriage negotiations. They are keen to find long-term solutions ahead of what they referred to as the “retrans season” starting next month, when many agreements come up for renewal.  “We’re in an environment where programing costs are rising at well above inflation and well above what I think consumers are willing to pay,” said DirecTV CEO Mike White at a recent investor conference. “I think content costs are a challenge for the entire industry.”  ",9272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cable/in-switch-cable-operators-want-to-go-a-la-carte-idUSTRE78Q6EE20110927

224,DIS,"CBS wins TV premiere week, Fox tops in 18-49s"," LOS ANGELES, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Revamped comedy “Two and A Half Men” helped CBS become the most watched U.S. TV network for the third straight opening week of the new season, but Fox was tops with 18-49 year-old viewers, television ratings showed on Tuesday.   CBS ended the key debut week with a leading 12.1 million average viewers in primetime, followed by ABC with 9.9 million, Fox at 8.4 million and NBC luring 7.5 million, media research company Nielsen said.   Despite a lukewarm reception for its high-profile “X Factor” singing contest, Fox found a hit with comedy “New Girl,” starring Zooey Deschanel, and for the first time won the premiere week among viewers 18- to 49-years-old, a key demographic group that is coveted by advertisers.   CBS was second among 18-49 year-olds, ABC third and NBC fourth.   NBC, seeking to rise from its bottom place under new owners Comcast Corp, found little love for some of its new shows. Its controversial drama “Playboy Club” started poorly last week with 5 million total viewers, and audiences dropped off to 3.9 million for Monday’s second episode.   Both Fox and ABC increased their overall audience compared to last year’s premiere week. ABC grew 3 percent thanks to large audiences tuning-in to its Emmy-winning comedy “Modern Family”, new drama “Revenge” and crime series “Castle”, while Fox was up 28 percent in overall viewers.   CBS had the top five scripted programs in viewers, led by the record 28.7 million who watched fired star Charlie Sheen’s character being killed off in the premiere of “Two and A Half Men”. Crime series “NCIS” and new comedy “Two Broke Girls” also did well for the network.

Police were called to CBS Television City in Los Angeles — where the ABC ballroom contest is filmed — after powder was found in a mailroom envelope.   Los Angeles police spokeswoman Diana Figueroa said the substance was found to be “not dangerous.”   “It was addressed to ‘Dancing With the Stars’,” she added. It was not known if a specific name was included.   CBS and ABC could not immediately be reached for comment.   It’s the second time in a year that white powder has been sent to the TV contest, which pairs celebrities with professional dancers and allows the public to vote for their favorites.   The current cast includes feisty TV legal commentator Nancy Grace, gay stylist Carson Kressley, Rob Kardashian, Cher’s transgender son Chaz Bono, and David Arquette, the estranged husband of Courteney Cox.   In November last year, white powder was found at the CBS complex in an office linked to the dance show when Bristol Palin was a contestant, but a possible connection to Palin was never officially confirmed.

227,DIS,"""Dolphin Tale"" jumps to top of movie box office","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Simba the lion may rule the jungle, but he couldn’t beat a plucky dolphin at the weekend box office.  Family film “Dolphin Tale” made a surprising leap to first place with a projected $14.2 million in domestic ticket sales over three days, studio estimates released on Sunday showed.  The movie about an injured dolphin rehabilitated with a prosthetic tail, which finished third last week, knocked “The Lion King 3D” from the box office throne it held the past two weekends. “Lion King” dropped to third with $11.1 million.  In between the animal-themed family films was “Moneyball,” a baseball drama starring Brad Pitt as a general manager who fields a small-budget team of unlikely contenders. The film finished in second place with $12.5 million at North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters.  All three holdover films outranked four newcomers, showing the appeal in recent weeks of feel-good movies over heavier-themed films.  The fall movie season, typically a time for more serious films, has “seen a shift to the more upbeat and even inspirational films and family fare,” said Paul Dergarabedian, who heads up Hollywood.com Box Office.  “Dolphin Tale” has gained on strong word-of-mouth buzz after rave reviews from critics and moviegoers, said Andrew Kosove, co-CEO of Alcon Entertainment, the studio that produced the film. The movie is one of just a few this year to earn an A+ rating from audiences polled by survey firm CinemaScore.  “The Lion King” also has drawn filmgoers with a triumphant story despite being a 17-year-old film. The Walt Disney Co animated classic has rung up $79.7 million domestically and $19 million in international markets since it returned to theaters last month.  Combined, “Lion King” has grossed $98.7 million during its new run.  Of four new releases this weekend, comedy “50/50” had the best showing in fourth place but still fell short of studio hopes with $8.9 million. The film is a buddy comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Leavitt as a young man with cancer and Seth Rogen as his well-meaning friend. Despite the heavy topic, the movie earned an A- rating from CinemaScore. The film cost about $8 million to produce.  While the cancer theme posed a “challenge,” the film’s makers hope audiences in the coming weeks will focus on the relationship between the friends and how the illness is “handled with humor,” said Richie Fay, president of domestic distribution for Summit Entertainment, which released the film.  In fifth place was drama “Courageous,” a Christian-themed film about four police officers coping with a tragedy. The movie generated $8.8 million, beating studio forecasts of $6 million and more than earning back its production cost of $2 million. It also won an A+ from CinemaScore.  “Dream House,” a new horror film, disappointed with $8.3 million to manage only sixth place for its A-list cast. It stars Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz and James Bond actor Daniel Craig. Critics bashed the movie with only 5 percent surveyed by website Rotten Tomatoes giving a positive review.  Morgan Creek, the studio that produced the film, noted the movie earned a B from audiences polled by CinemaScore.  The weekend’s other new film, adult romantic comedy “What’s Your Number?,” floundered in eighth place with $5.6 million. In the movie, star Anna Faris revisits past relationships to see if any of her ex-boyfriends look more appealing.

Scripps Co for $212 million in cash.  McGraw-Hill said in June that it was putting the stations up for sale in what has become a major plan to split up the mini-conglomerate and sell its extraneous pieces.  “This divestiture will produce good value for a non-strategic asset as we work to create two focused operating companies, one centered on capital and commodities markets and the other on digital learning and education services,” Chief Executive Harold McGraw said in a statement on Monday.  The stations, which include affiliates of Disney’s ABC, had revenue in 2010 of $97 million, according to a statement from Scripps.  A person familiar with the transaction who was not authorized to speak on the record said the purchase price was 10 times cash flow, but that multiple could not be immediately confirmed.  “Important to investors will be the multiple of earnings they were sold for, which we don’t have yet,” stock analyst Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray & Co. said in an email.  McGraw-Hill did not say how much it expects to gain from the transaction after taxes. The company has owned the stations for many years, Appert said.

The partnership, announced on Monday, started with the debut of GoodMorningAmerica.com on Yahoo and three video series with ABC News correspondents and anchors that will run online before they run on television.   The alliance comes as Yahoo’s board searches for a successor to ousted Chief Executive Carol Bartz and contemplates selling the company, which has been losing market share and prominence as one of the world’s top online destinations.   Jack Ma, founder and chief executive of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group, said last week he was interested in buying the Internet search and advertising company. Yahoo’s 43 percent stake in Alibaba is considered one of its most valuable assets.

235,DIS,Disney moves in on Angry Birds with Swampy game,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - It’s not surprising, perhaps, that a game based on a sewer-dwelling alligator named “Swampy” ranks as the top paid app for iPhones and iPads. What’s surprising is that the game is a product of Walt Disney Co.  Swampy is the title character on a quest to stay clean in a low-cost, mobile video game called “Where’s My Water?” that Disney hopes will lead to a turnaround of its struggling gaming business.  Within 24 hours of its release on September 22, “Where’s My Water?” — a 99-cent puzzle game where players try to help Swampy keep clean by digging paths to guide water to his subterranean bathtub — rose to the top of Apple Inc’s App Store and has stayed there since.  The game featuring Swampy, who is the first Disney character created specifically for a mobile game, currently ranks ahead of Rovio’s wildly popular “Angry Birds” as the top paid app for iPhones and iPads, underscoring the threat that established, deep-pocketed companies like Disney and Electronic Arts pose for upstarts like Rovio and Zynga.  In an interview with Reuters, Bart Decrem, head of Disney’s mobile gaming operations, declined to provide figures for downloads or other financial measures, saying only that the game “has been really well-received, doing really well in terms of downloads and chart positions around the world.”  Though it is early days, Swampy has the potential to develop into the kind of hit Disney needs to help revive its interactive unit, which includes online, mobile and social games plus virtual worlds such as the Club Penguin website. The division is the company’s smallest unit by revenue and is being revamped after several quarters of losses.  Disney last year bought social games maker Playdom for about $563 million. In the quarter that ended in July, the interactive unit lost $86 million despite a 27 percent increase in revenue from a year earlier to $251 million.  “Where’s My Water?” could boost the unit’s earnings if it grabs a big enough piece of the mobile games industry, which is expected to grow globally to $11.4 billion by 2014, according to research firm Gartner.  Last year, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger charged two digital veterans — James Pitaro and John Pleasants — to turn around the division. The pair have said they plan to bring the division to profitability in 2013.  One way to accomplish that goal is for Disney to leverage Swampy and other gaming characters across its theme parks, movie studio and media networks much the same way it does its stable of mermaids, princesses and other characters, Decrem said. Right now, however, Swampy is still too green to become the next Mickey Mouse.  “First, Swampy needs to continue to prove himself,” Decrem said, adding that it will take about three months to judge the character’s staying power.  Mobile games for phones and tablets, one of the few bright spots in the beaten-down global video game business, are cheaper to make and purchase than games for consoles. As a result, they have started to eat in to the profits of companies such as Activision Blizzard Inc.  While Disney typically brings characters from movies to games, Swampy could go the other direction from game to television or movie screens, Decrem said.  Disney, which competes with Electronic Arts in mobile games, is looking at Google Inc’s Android software and other platforms for the game, Decrem said. Disney shares closed trading Tuesday up almost 3 percent to $29.86.  ",10042011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-game/disney-moves-in-on-angry-birds-with-swampy-game-idUSTRE7936ZI20111004

Banking on the success of “The Lion King 3D,” which is set to cross the $80 million U.S. box office threshold Tuesday, the movie studio said it would release a 3D version of 1991 fairytale “Beauty and the Beast” in January 2012 for a limited run in movie theaters.  It will be followed by Pixar’s sea-adventure “Finding Nemo” in September 2012, “Monsters, Inc.” in January 2013 and the classic 1989 Disney romance “The Little Mermaid” in September 2013.  “Great stories and great characters are timeless, and at Disney we’re fortunate to have a treasure trove of both,” said Alan Bergman, president, The Walt Disney Studios.  “We’re thrilled to give audiences of all ages the chance to experience these beloved tales in an exciting new way with 3D - and in the case of younger generations, for the first time on the big screen,” Bergman said in a statement.  Since 1994, “The Lion King” has earned more than $880 million worldwide, and with recent sales from “The Lion King 3D,” the beloved tale of the African animal kingdom has surpassed the $1 billion threshold at the global box office.  Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” and “The Little Mermaid” have so far earned $380 million and $228 million worldwide respectively.  Pixar’s 2001 hit “Monsters, Inc.” made $526 million worldwide and the 2003 Oscar-winning film “Finding Nemo” made more than $867 million, earning the title of the fifth worldwide highest-grossing animated film.

The game featuring Swampy, who is the first Disney character created specifically for a mobile game, currently ranks ahead of Rovio’s wildly popular “Angry Birds” as the top paid app for iPhones and iPads, underscoring the threat that established, deep-pocketed companies like Disney and Electronic Arts ERTS.O pose for upstarts like Rovio and Zynga.    In an interview with Reuters, Bart Decrem, head of Disney’s mobile gaming operations, declined to provide figures for downloads or other financial measures, saying only that the game “has been really well-received, doing really well in terms of downloads and chart positions around the world.”   Though it is early days, Swampy has the potential to develop into the kind of hit Disney needs to help revive its interactive unit, which includes online, mobile and social games plus virtual worlds such as the Club Penguin website. The division is the company’s smallest unit by revenue and is being revamped after several quarters of losses.   Disney last year bought social games maker Playdom for about $563 million. In the quarter that ended in July, the interactive unit lost $86 million despite a 27 percent increase in revenue from a year earlier to $251 million.   “Where’s My Water?” could boost the unit’s earnings if it grabs a big enough piece of the mobile games industry, which is expected to grow globally to $11.4 billion by 2014, according to research firm Gartner.   Last year, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger charged two digital veterans — James Pitaro and John Pleasants — to turn around the division. The pair have said they plan to bring the division to profitability in 2013.   One way to accomplish that goal is for Disney to leverage Swampy and other gaming characters across its theme parks, movie studio and media networks much the same way it does its stable of mermaids, princesses and other characters, Decrem said. Right now, however, Swampy is still too green to become the next Mickey Mouse.   “First, Swampy needs to continue to prove himself,” Decrem said, adding that it will take about three months to judge the character’s staying power.    Mobile games for phones and tablets, one of the few bright spots in the beaten-down global video game business, are cheaper to make and purchase than games for consoles. As a result, they have started to eat in to the profits of companies such as Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI.O)   While Disney typically brings characters from movies to games, Swampy could go the other direction from game to television or movie screens, Decrem said.   Disney, which competes with Electronic Arts in mobile games, is looking at Google Inc’s (GOOG.O) Android software and other platforms for the game, Decrem said. Disney shares closed trading Tuesday up almost 3 percent to $29.86.  (Reporting by Lisa Richwine and Liana B.

238,DIS,"""Nemo"", ""Little Mermaid"" swim back to big screen in 3D"," LOS ANGELES, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Hot on the heels of the box office success of “The Lion King 3D,” Disney and Pixar are reviving four of their classic animated films in 3D versions for movie theaters.   Banking on the success of “The Lion King 3D,” which is set to cross the $80 million U.S. box office threshold on Tuesday, the movie studio said it would release a 3D version of 1991 fairytale “Beauty and the Beast” in January 2012 for a limited run in movie theaters.   It will be followed by Pixar’s sea-adventure “Finding Nemo” in September 2012, “Monsters, Inc.” in January 2013 and the classic 1989 Disney romance “The Little Mermaid” in September 2013.   “Great stories and great characters are timeless, and at Disney we’re fortunate to have a treasure trove of both,” said Alan Bergman, president, The Walt Disney Studios.   “We’re thrilled to give audiences of all ages the chance to experience these beloved tales in an exciting new way with 3D - and in the case of younger generations, for the first time on the big screen,” Bergman said in a statement.   Since 1994, “The Lion King” has earned more than $880 million worldwide, and with recent sales from “The Lion King 3D,” the beloved tale of the African animal kingdom has surpassed the $1 billion threshold at the global box office.   Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” and “The Little Mermaid” have so far earned $380 million and $228 million worldwide respectively.   Pixar’s 2001 hit “Monsters, Inc.” made $526 million worldwide and the 2003 Oscar-winning film “Finding Nemo” made more than $867 million, earning the title of the fifth worldwide highest-grossing animated film.

239,DIS,UPDATE 4-EU court clears fans to watch games via foreign boxes," * ECJ says it may be legal for fans to use foreign TV services   * Practice of selling rights country-by-country breaches EU law   * London High Court to apply ruling in current case   * Rights holders set to come up with new system   (Adds Premier League and Sky reaction)	   By Michele Sinner and Kate Holton	   LUXEMBOURG/LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Europe’s highest court has opened the way for sports fans to watch live matches through foreign TV services, throwing in to doubt the value of highly sought-after and lucrative broadcast rights.	   The legal ruling, which will have huge ramifications for the way rights are sold, was sparked by English pub landlady Karen Murphy who was fined for screening live English Premier League matches via a Greek pay-TV decoder.	   In response, the court ruled that the sale of rights on a country-by-country basis breached EU law.	   “National legislation which prohibits the import, sale or use of foreign decoder cards is contrary to the freedom to provide services and cannot be justified,” it said.	   The ruling potentially throws in to question the value of rights bought by Britain’s BSkyB , which owns the majority of live rights for Premier League matches, and other European broadcasters such as Sky Deutschland SKYDn.DE.	   However many lawyers and analysts said the ruling would simply spark a scramble by rights holders such as the Premier League to come up with a new system, and one that could even cost sports fans more dearly in the future.	   “The ruling strikes at the heart of the business model that many an industry is built on, particularly the broadcasting and entertainment industries,” said Tom Scourfield, a partner at CMS Cameron McKenna specialising in IP and media law.	   “If the business model must change, so sports and content licensing will also evolve. If the legislation is interpreted in such a way that requires a single deal for the European Union, that may mean prices even rise overall, rather than fall.” 	   Broadcasters in Britain, such as BSkyB, pay much higher fees for the Premier League rights than broadcasters in other parts of Europe. One option would be for the Premier League to sell rights on a pan-European basis, or not at all to certain countries.	   Ashurst partner Dominic Batchelor said broadcast rights were so lucrative that rights holders were bound to seek other ways to maintain their revenues. 	   “This decision may even be an own-goal for fans if the cost of watching broadcasts becomes fixed at the highest price attainable in the whole of the EU,” he said.	   Murphy said she had pursued the case because there was no choice in Britain over how to secure live Premier League matches and her lawyer Paul Dixon told Reuters the ruling should introduce greater competition into the market place.	   However while the ruling appears to allow residential customers to use foreign pay-TV cards, it may be more complicated for pubs and clubs, which it said have to consider copyright law. 	   It said the Premier League did not own the copyright to matches but said it did own copyright to the graphics, anthem and video clips that run before games. 	   A pub could potentially get around this issue by not showing the opening sequence. However Liberum financial analyst Ian Whittaker noted that the Premier League could embed more ‘copyrighted’ material such as graphics or logos in to matches to complicate the issue.	   The Premier League said in a statement that only BSkyB and ESPN were authorised to broadcast the matches and said it would sell its rights in a way that best met the needs of fans across Europe.	   Sky said it would continue to secure high-quality content for its customers, based on the rights available.	   BSkyB owns nearly all the live rights to broadcast English Premier League soccer and the League has been keen to clamp down on the numerous pubs around Britain which show matches via foreign services instead.	   BSkyB and ESPN paid a combined 1.78 billion pounds ($2.75 billion) for the British broadcast rights for a three-year deal starting in 2010. International rights raised over a billion pounds, with Europe contributing around 300 million pounds.	   Shares in BSkyB closed down 2.7 percent, broadly in line with the FTSE 100 Index.	   Whittaker said the issue would hang over Sky until it was fully resolved, noting that the broadcast of matches in pubs and commercial venues was a high margin business. However it was not clear how many customers would want to drop their Sky contract for a foreign supplier. 	   The London High Court will now decide how to apply the ruling in Murphy’s case.

240,DIS,ESPN pulls Hank Jr. theme from football show,"BOSTON (Reuters) - ESPN pulled Hank Williams Jr.’s theme song from its “Monday Night Football” broadcast in a rebuke to the country music star for comments earlier in the day comparing President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler.  Williams, a Republican, had appeared on a Fox News’ morning television show “FOX and Friends” on Monday, and was asked which of his party’s presidential candidates he liked.  “Nobody,” he answered and then offered unprompted commentary on Obama’s golf game this summer with House Speaker John Boehner. He called it a political mistake because “it turned a lot of people off.”  Obama and Boehner played side by side that day against Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich at the height of the congressional budget debate.  Asked what he did not like about the friendly bipartisan golf match, Williams replied, “Come on! It’d be like Hitler playing golf with (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu.”  “They’re the enemy! Obama! And Biden!” he added.  The network, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co, responded on Monday by yanking Williams’ familiar “MNF” theme, “All My Rowdy Friends,” adapted from his 1984 hit song “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight,” from the introduction of the broadcast.  The song has opened “Monday Night Football” on both ABC and ESPN since 1991.  “While Hank Williams Jr. is not an ESPN employee, we recognize that he is closely linked to our company through the open to ‘Monday Night Football,’” the sports channel said in a statement.  “We are extremely disappointed with his comments and as a result we have decided to pull the open from tonight’s telecast,” the statement said.  A spokesman for Bristol, Connecticut-based ESPN said it had not decided whether the action would be permanent.  Williams, 62, later issued a statement acknowledging that his “analogy was extreme” but was intended “to make a point.”  “I was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me — how ludicrous that pairing was,” he said. “They’re polar opposites and it made no sense. They don’t see eye-to-eye and never will. I have always respected the office of the president.”  He added, “When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole, when everybody else is without a job — it just makes a whole lot of us angry.”  According to media reports, the team of Obama and Boehner beat Biden and Kasich at the summer golf matchup.

243,DIS,Wal-Mart goes back to basics in holiday toy aisles,"NORTH BERGEN, New Jersey (Reuters) - Wal-Mart is taking cues from shoppers who have asked for more time to buy for the holiday season, albeit on tight budgets, as it tries to reinvigorate sales of toys and other goods.  Wal-Mart, the U.S. discount chain run by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), is introducing its own toy line called Kid Connection, with items at prices such as $4.97 and $9.97 to appeal to parents who want to treat their kids but cannot spend much.  Later this month, it will also offer layaway on toys and electronics for the first time since 2006.  The world’s largest retailer’s core low-to-middle income shoppers continue to face a fragile economy including higher gasoline and food prices, high unemployment, a housing slump and the shaky stock market.  “What we’ve seen is that parents will try to meet the expectations of the kids first,” said Laura Phillips, chief toy officer and senior vice president of toys and seasonal merchandising, as she walked the aisles of a Wal-Mart store in North Bergen, New Jersey on Wednesday.  Some decorations such as Christmas trees went on sale in late September, a couple of weeks earlier than usual. Wal-Mart also cut prices on dozens of toys starting on September 12, a “rollback” that came a little earlier than usual.  “One of the things we heard from customers is they wanted more pay cycles to be able to break their purchases into chunks,” Phillips said.  Eight-five percent of transactions at Wal-Mart are paid for with cash. The company hopes that its shoppers who do not have access to credit cards will take advantage of layaway, a service that has been successful for competitors such as Toys R Us TOY.UL and Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O).  Wal-Mart is bringing back a host of items, such as Christmas village sets and outdoor decorations, that it had removed from stores last year as part of a failed attempt to streamline its assortment of goods.  Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart hopes that such efforts will ignite sales growth at stores open at least a year. Its U.S. same-store sales have fallen for nine quarters. They finally perked up in July and Wal-Mart aims for quarterly U.S. same-store sales growth sometime this year.  Some of the toys highlighted in Wal-Mart’s top 20 holiday season toy list, released on Wednesday, read like a lineup for kids raised in earlier decades, such as Hasbro Inc’s (HAS.O) updated Easy Bake Oven and Mattel Inc’s (MAT.O) Barbie Camper.  Wal-Mart is also using signs with Sesame Street characters, among others, to draw attention to its toy aisles. It has some exclusive toys tied to the reissue of Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) “The Lion King” movie, which hit theaters last month and was released on Blu-ray DVD on Tuesday.  Of course, it is not all about retro items this year.  Phillips, like many others in the industry, expects tablet computers such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPad 2 to be big sellers. She anticipates that Wal-Mart’s layaway program will give it a big advantage in that category, as chains such as Sears’ Kmart do not stock as many tablets as Wal-Mart does.  Leapfrog Enterprises Inc’s LF.N LeapPad Explorer for kids, priced at around $99, is also on Wal-Mart’s top 20 list.

Early trading was choppy as the market struggled for firm direction after a dramatic turnaround late on Tuesday in which shares ended sharply higher on reports European officials would act to safeguard banks.   Over six sessions, the S&P has fallen 10 percent and investors who bet against the market were suddenly forced to cover short positions as the market shifted.   “All measures we look at indicate that the market is extremely cheap, but we’re all still waiting on developments from Europe,” said Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer of Advisers Capital Management, LLC in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. “There remain questions about how it will all be resolved, and it is by no means certain that the resolution will come in a responsible way that won’t cause market turmoil.”   The S&P briefly dipped into bear market territory on Tuesday, meaning the index declined 20 percent from recent highs.   Big reversals late in a session are not often good predictors of direction. Since 2001, there have been nine days when the market rebounded from a 1 percent loss in the last hour — and in eight of those, stocks fell the next day, according to Bespoke Investment Group of Harrison, New York.   U.S. private-sector employers added 91,000 jobs in September, according to the ADP National Employment Report, topping forecasts and increasing optimism about Friday’s non-farm payrolls report from the Labor Department.

Baker   LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - It’s not surprising, perhaps, that a game based on a sewer-dwelling alligator named “Swampy” ranks as the top paid app for iPhones and iPads. What’s surprising is that the game is a product of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).   Swampy is the title character on a quest to stay clean in a low-cost, mobile video game called “Where’s My Water?” that Disney hopes will lead to a turnaround of its struggling gaming business.   Within 24 hours of its release on Sept. 22, “Where’s My Water?” — a 99-cent puzzle game where players try to help Swampy keep clean by digging paths to guide water to his subterranean bathtub — rose to the top of Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) App Store and has stayed there since.   The game featuring Swampy, who is the first Disney character created specifically for a mobile game, currently ranks ahead of Rovio’s wildly popular “Angry Birds” as the top paid app for iPhones and iPads, underscoring the threat that established, deep-pocketed companies like Disney and Electronic Arts ERTS.O pose for upstarts like Rovio and Zynga.    In an interview with Reuters, Bart Decrem, head of Disney’s mobile gaming operations, declined to provide figures for downloads or other financial measures, saying only that the game “has been really well-received, doing really well in terms of downloads and chart positions around the world.”   Though it is early days, Swampy has the potential to develop into the kind of hit Disney needs to help revive its interactive unit, which includes online, mobile and social games plus virtual worlds such as the Club Penguin website. The division is the company’s smallest unit by revenue and is being revamped after several quarters of losses.   Disney last year bought social games maker Playdom for about $563 million. In the quarter that ended in July, the interactive unit lost $86 million despite a 27 percent increase in revenue from a year earlier to $251 million.   “Where’s My Water?” could boost the unit’s earnings if it grabs a big enough piece of the mobile games industry, which is expected to grow globally to $11.4 billion by 2014, according to research firm Gartner.   Last year, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger charged two digital veterans — James Pitaro and John Pleasants — to turn around the division. The pair have said they plan to bring the division to profitability in 2013.   One way to accomplish that goal is for Disney to leverage Swampy and other gaming characters across its theme parks, movie studio and media networks much the same way it does its stable of mermaids, princesses and other characters, Decrem said. Right now, however, Swampy is still too green to become the next Mickey Mouse.   “First, Swampy needs to continue to prove himself,” Decrem said, adding that it will take about three months to judge the character’s staying power.

247,DIS,NY prosecutors sue BNY Mellon over forex claims,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) was sued on Tuesday by New York federal and state prosecutors who accused the bank of cheating clients in foreign exchange transactions.  In two separate lawsuits seeking in excess of $2 billion, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney and the New York Attorney General alleged the bank misled clients about the method for determining what currency exchange rates it used for certain foreign exchange transactions.  Both lawsuits targeted the “standing instruction” service offered by the bank in which it provides clients with an as-needed basis for foreign exchange services.  Prosecutors accused the bank of promising clients the best available rate but instead giving them the worst or nearly the worst and then making a profit for itself from the price differential.  The lawsuit filed in New York state court by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is seeking to recover nearly $2 billion for BNY Mellon clients nationwide.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said his lawsuit, filed in federal court, is seeking “hundreds of millions of dollars” in civil penalties on behalf of the government.  A BNY Mellon spokesman said in a statement that the New York Attorney General’s action was based on a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the foreign exchange market and the role of custodian banks.  “Simply put, this is the kind of prosecutorial overreach that ill serves New York, New Yorkers and the pension funds that the Office of New York Attorney General purports to represent,” said the spokesman.  He also said that the U.S. Attorney’s lawsuit is flawed.  “It fundamentally misunderstands and mischaracterizes the global foreign exchange market and the valuable services we provide to our clients as a principal in foreign exchange transactions,” he said.  According to the lawsuit filed by Schneiderman’s office, BNY Mellon made misrepresentations about its foreign exchange operations to some of the most recognizable corporations, investment funds, educational institutions, pension funds, and governmental organizations in the world, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT.O), Sears, Roebuck & Co, the World Bank, Duke University, and The Walt Disney Company (DIS.N).  From 2001 to the present, the bank engaged in a “multi-pronged campaign of deception” designed to induce private and government clients into believing that they would receive the best rate of the day for their foreign currency transactions, the lawsuit said.  New York is the latest state to bring claims against BNY Mellon, which has been battling allegations of FX overcharging for months. Virginia and Florida filed lawsuits against the company in August.  The New York Attorney General said the lawsuit, which was brought with the city of New York, adds new claims to an existing whistleblower action that was filed under seal by FX Analytics in 2009. FX Analytics also first brought the lawsuits in Virginia and Florida.  The New York Attorney General’s lawsuit makes claims of violations of New York’s Martin Act, a powerful statute from the 1920s that has been used to investigate and prosecute securities fraud on Wall Street.  On behalf of clients who were New York city and state entities, the suit also said that BNY Mellon violated the New York city and state False Claims Acts.  The famous fraud investigator Harry Markopolos, who raised concerns about Bernard Madoff, said he was behind the FX Analytics lawsuits and that the New York Attorney General’s lawsuit was the biggest of its kind.  “This affects tens of millions of American retirees’ pension accounts,” he said.  The case brought by the U.S. Attorney brings claims under the Financial Institutional Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, which allows prosecutors to recover civil penalties for violating certain criminal statutes.  The state case is State of New York v. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 09/114735. Information about the federal case was not immediately available.

255,DIS,Disney's Iger to leave CEO post in 2015,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Bob Iger will step down as CEO in March 2015 after nearly a decade at the helm, setting in motion a succession plan for the largest U.S. media and entertainment company. The company did not mention possible successors, but industry speculation centered on Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and the head of Disney’s huge theme parks and resorts division, Tom Staggs. Iger, 60, succeeded Michael Eisner as Disney’s CEO in October 2005, which means his tenure as chief executive would be less than a decade long. Eisner’s reign at Disney, which ranks among the longest and most storied — for better and worse — in CEO history, lasted 21 years, from 1984 until 2005. Disney shares fell 1 percent to close at $31.70 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company has increased in value by more than a third since Iger began his term. Disney, which generates some $40 billion in annual revenue, is grappling with economic uncertainty and its impact on its three largest divisions: media, its movie studio and theme park resorts. In August, the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results, but Wall Street analysts warned that low consumer spending may pinch in coming months. “It’s wise for Disney’s board to have a very clear succession plan,” said Miller Tabak & Co analyst David Joyce. Still, he said, Iger’s plan to leave the CEO post is “a little surprising given he’s still a little young-ish CEO.” Speculation that Iger might have identified a successor picked up in 2009 after Disney said Staggs and Rasulo were swapping jobs. Staggs, 50, was known as a favored executive and is considered a potential successor to Iger, but the former Wall Street analyst lacked operational experience. By putting Staggs in charge of Disney’s all-important theme parks, analysts said, Iger may have been affirming Staggs as a strong internal candidate for the top job while giving the finance chief much-needed operating experience. Iger will assume the post of chairman, in addition to CEO, starting in March 2012, when Chairman John Pepper retires. Iger will hold the jobs through March 31, 2015, and continue as executive chairman through June 30, 2016. His annual salary rose to $2.5 million from $2 million now. Iger also could receive as much as $12 million in annual cash bonuses and up to $15.5 million a year in options and restricted shares. Iger, who got his start as a TV weatherman, joined Disney after Eisner’s deal to buy Capital Cities/ABC in 1995, a $19 billion deal that caught everyone flat-footed when announced. Iger served as Eisner’s second-in-command for the last five years of his tenure. His loyalty and deference to Eisner led to mocking from media insiders that Iger had no thought that Eisner did not already approve. After taking over in 2005, however, Iger stunned the very same people with bold moves that betrayed his prior image. In a matter of months, he not only smoothed over the friction Eisner created with Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs, but also convinced Jobs to sell Pixar animation studios to Disney for $7.4 billion. In addition to the studio, that deal also made Jobs the company’s largest individual shareholder and landed him on Disney’s board, giving Iger unfettered access to Jobs’ insights on how to re-orient an old media company to the digital world. Iger bought Marvel Entertainment for $4.4 billion, aggressively moved Disney programing online through partnerships with online video service Hulu and others, and ousted longtime executives such as Dick Cook, David Westin and Stephen McPherson who he felt were underperforming. In terms of style, Iger and Eisner could not have been more different. Eisner was brash, aggressive, confrontational and hands on in every aspect of Disney’s business. Iger is quiet, laid back, borderline robotic and prefers to allow those under him to run their fiefdoms as they see fit. “He’s a very calm personality,” Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said, adding that “people are very happy with Iger from a strategic perspective.” Iger rose to the CEO role in part because of disenchantment among investors at Eisner’s leadership, particularly the way he handled the $66 billion hostile takeover offer from Comcast Corp in 2004. At the company’s annual shareholder meeting following that offer, Eisner received a stunning 43 percent no-confidence vote from shareholders and was forced to relinquish his chairman of the board title.

Hulu’s owners, which also include News Corp , Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and Providence Equity, said in a statement on Thursday they had decided against a sale of the video service. “Our focus now rests solely on ensuring that our efforts as owners contribute in a meaningful way to the exciting future that lies ahead for Hulu,” they said in a statement. Reuters reported last month that the auction was in danger of getting derailed by conflicts over convoluted digital rights, a wide bid-ask gap, and a lack of commitment to sell by Hulu’s owners, among other things. This was the second time Hulu’s owners had envisioned a full or partial exit strategy that failed. After nearly six months of planning, they ditched an initial public offering last December that might have raised up to $300 million. Sources with knowledge of the talks said last month a rift had developed between the price bidders offered and the amount that Hulu’s owners were willing to accept. Bids had ranged from as low as $500 million to as much as $2 billion, the sources said at the time. The most serious suitors included Google Inc , Amazon.com Inc , DirecTV and DISH Network Corp . Yahoo Inc had been viewed as one of the most enthusiastic bidders — before its leadership imploded with the abrupt firing of CEO Carol Bartz. Hulu’s owners had always faced an uphill battle in valuing a nascent Web content-streaming service with no long-term content deals and with unclear digital rights for newer Internet or mobile platforms for which there exists no established model. Some analysts had thought an outright sale to be an abandonment of Hulu’s future growth potential, particularly if, as some experts say, Internet streaming will become mainstream in coming years.",10142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/hulu/update-2-hulu-sale-called-off-after-months-of-talks-idUSL3E7LD3MS20111014

The film earned $16.3 million of that total from U.S. and Canadian theaters. “Footloose,” the story of teenagers who defy their small town’s ban on dancing, was close behind with $16.1 million from U.S. and Canadian theaters. Appeal to families helped “Real Steel” come out on top, said Dave Hollis, Disney’s executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution.

To date, the movie has earned $51.7 million at North American theaters plus $56.6 million in international markets, for a combined global tally of $108.3 million. The “Footloose” debut performed in line with studio expectations and earned an A rating from audiences polled by survey firm CinemaScore, said Don Harris, president of domestic distribution for Paramount Pictures, which released the film.

Iger brings sector expertise and Disney’s clout as the world’s largest media and entertainment conglomerate to bear, as Apple prepares to step up a fight with the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc over content and its distribution. Many on Wall Street also expect an attempt soon to shake up the fragmented television market, much as Apple did with iTunes and music years ago. “Apple is going to get more into content distribution over time on the video side. That’s where it makes sense for someone like Bob Iger from Disney to have that relationship with Apple,” Morningstar analyst Michael Corty said. Apple is taking the fight to Internet distribution and the so-called “cloud”. It recently launched “iTunes Match”, a service that for a fee of $24.99 scans the content of your music library and matches it with music available on its iTunes Store. Google is expected to announce this week an online music service similar to iTunes. In coming years, investors are betting that Apple will launch a full-fledged assault on TV, though skeptics say it will prove difficult to arrange distribution agreements with cable and content companies. Jobs was himself a director at Disney, whose corporate empire encompasses TV network ABC, sports cable channel ESPN, movie studios and theme parks and resorts. He and Iger forged a strong relationship after Disney bought Pixar — which Jobs took over in 1986 — for about $7.4 billion in 2006.

Levinson had been a co-lead Apple director since 2005, alongside Avon Products Inc’s Andrea Jung. Apple had lacked a chairman until Jobs in August took the role, relinquishing his CEO duties at the same time because he could no longer fulfill them due to his worsening health. The company argued that co-lead arrangement enhanced its independence. But analysts have said Jobs’ exercised enormous influence over the board. They said his absence would trigger major changes for the board, elevating them beyond being merely advisors to a visionary leader. The board may have to take more control, be less deferential to new CEO Tim Cook than it was to Jobs and meet more often, they said. The naming of an independent chairman was welcomed by corporate governance experts. “The board knows it’s going to be under the microscope and Tim Cook knows that as well,” said Jim Post, a professor of corporate governance at Boston University School of Management who called for an independent chairman. “The board has to move out of Steve Jobs’ shadow and they have to act to like an independent board.” “The steps they have taken today move them in a better direction,” he added.

265,DIS,"Director segues from ""Conchords"" to ""Muppets""","LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - With Disney’s film reboot of “The Muppets” raking in $29.5 million during its first weekend and claiming second place at the box office — and a 98 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes — director James Bobin is smiling as wide as Dr. Teeth. TheWrap talked with the first-time feature-film director about his revival of franchise players Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and Animal; how “The Muppets” wouldn’t have been possible without the HBO series “Flight of the Conchords,” which he co-created; and decoding the film’s inside references. TheWrap: So how do you segue from something like the adult-oriented “Flight of the Conchords” to the family-oriented “The Muppets”? James Bobin: It was a logical progression. “Conchords” was also a musical comedy, and I was adamant this would be a musical comedy, too. I had a hunch that if I married the “Conchords” sensibility with the Muppets, it could work. A few years ago on “Conchords,” Kristen Schaal (who played the Conchords’ fan Mel) sung a very Muppet-y song with puppet cookies, “Like in My Dreams.” Also, during breaks from writing, we would watch Muppet clips on YouTube. The Muppets kept popping up in my life. When the call came, it was serendipity. TheWrap: Still, how does a first-time director get handed such a storied franchise? Bobin: It was in 2009, and I had just finished the second season of “Conchords.” I got an email from my agent that simply said, “Do you like the Muppets?” I said, “Of course.” We had some conversations with producers David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman. We were very clear about the scope of the movie we wanted to make. I was very keen to express my idea for the musicality of it. We met with Disney’s Executive Vice President of Production Kristin Burr, and it seemed to be a good fit. They pretty much trusted me, and didn’t lay down the law. I wasn’t going to put the Muppets in a direction where I could hurt them. TheWrap: With direct-to-TV and -video movies, the 2000s were maybe the roughest decade yet for the Muppets. How did you bring the franchise out of mainstream dormancy? Bobin: There’s a cyclical nature to what people like in the world. Through time, things come around again. It it their time. TheWrap: Did you have any cultural challenges in refreshing the veteran characters? Bobin: They haven’t really changed that much, and it was important that they be the way people remember them. But Bobby Benson, the leader of the Baby Band on “The Muppet Show,” had a cigarette permanently attached to his lips. Obviously, now you can’t do that. TheWrap: Did you feel pressure to live up to creator Jim Henson’s legacy? Bobin: I’ve always liked the Muppets. I watched “The Muppet Show” in England every week as a child. The show was originally broadcast in England, and they’re sacred, so I can’t imagine what it’s like over here. I didn’t want to ruin people’s childhoods, but I also couldn’t let that impinge on my creativity. TheWrap: Does “The Muppets” have any inside references that only fans will appreciate? Bobin: There are numerous (references), but I don’t want to give away too many. There is a gathering of the Muppets, and Sweetums comes running out of a car lot. It’s Mad Mooney’s, the same car lot that was used in (the first Muppets film, 1979’s) “The Muppet Movie.” We found it in Sun Valley, north of Los Angeles. We repainted the building. It was amazing to find the place still intact. I made the movie for people who obsess over the Muppets but also people who have never heard of them. TheWrap: In a 2001 interview with Jon Stewart, Kermit said “The Muppet Show” was close to returning to TV. Is that still a possibility? Bobin: I don’t see any reason they couldn’t do that. It would make perfect sense. TheWrap: Are you already planning a sequel? Bobin: My brain is so full of this (movie), I haven’t had the chance to think of anything else. On Disney’s part, I guess how “The Muppets” does will determine if there is a sequel. TheWrap: What about future plans for “Flight of the Conchords”? Bobin: I’m sure we’ll do something again in the future. My “Conchords” co-creators Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement love music and writing music, so I can’t imagine they won’t put out more. TheWrap: What other projects do you have in the works? Bobin: I just signed a deal with HBO for another half-hour comedy series, still untitled — I’m very committed to the half-hour format. HBO is a natural home for me.",11272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-muppets/director-segues-from-conchords-to-muppets-idUSTRE7AQ0OL20111127
266,DIS,UPDATE 1-'Breaking Dawn' tops holiday weekend box office,"* ‘Breaking Dawn’ global total $489 mln to date * Strong comeback for ‘The Muppets’ * ‘Hugo’ beats expectations  (Adds quotes, details on top five films) By Lisa Richwine NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Vampires feasted at the Thanksgiving weekend box office, bringing the newest “Twilight” movie its second win in a row over a strong comeback for “The Muppets” and other family fare that filled theaters. “The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn: Part 1” delivered an estimated $113.5 million around the globe from Friday through Sunday. The film ranked No. 1 for the second straight week at U.S. and Canadian theaters, where ticket sales hit $42 million for three days and $62.3 million over the five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend. The film’s total box-office take since its release reached $489.3 million globally. “Breaking Dawn: Part 1” is the fourth movie in the “Twilight” series, one of Hollywood’s most lucrative franchises. The movies are based on best-selling novels by Stephanie Meyer about a human-vampire-werewolf love triangle, a story that has generated legions of die-hard female fans. For the latest movie, “word of mouth is good. (Fans) are supporting the film,” said Richie Fay, president of domestic distribution for independent studio Summit Entertainment, which backed the film. In second place, audiences welcomed the Muppets back to theaters for the first time in 12 years. New Disney movie “The Muppets” starring Jason Segel and Amy Adams alongside Kermit, Miss Piggy and their puppet friends took in a strong $29.5 million at North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters in three days. The five-day holiday weekend haul reached $42.0 million domestically. Two international markets added $1.6 million. Disney bought the rights to the Muppets in 2004 and the media, entertainment and consumer-products giant is eager to interest a new generation in the characters. “It’s hard to have anyone argue we didn’t bring them back,” said Dave Hollis, Disney’s executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution. The movie’s performance “exceeded expectations,” he said. The Muppets starred on a weekly television show in the 1970s and early 1980s plus a series of films, the last being 1999’s “Muppets from Space.” Critics loved the new Muppets movie, with 98 percent giving a favorable review on aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences awarded an A rating on average, according to exit-polling firm CinemaScore. The movie cost about $45 million to produce. In third place for the weekend, dancing penguin sequel “Happy Feet Two” earned $13.4 million over three days domestically during its second weekend in theaters and $18.4 million through five days. Rounding out the top five were two other new family movies that critics adored. Animated 3D movie “Arthur Christmas,” which cost about $98 million to produce, pulled in $12.7 million at domestic theaters over three days and $17 million in five days to finish in fourth place. The movie explains how Santa delivers presents around the world in one night and has earned $22.3 million overseas since opening two weeks ago. Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Sony Pictures, said the film “opened about where we hoped it would” and he expected the Christmas theme would appeal throughout the holiday season. “Hugo,” a 3D family movie, ended the weekend in fifth place with $11.4 million over three days and $15.4 million over five days. The movie centers on an orphan living in a Paris train station in the 1930s. The film exceeded studio forecasts for its release in about 1,300 locations, far fewer than the 3,000-plus for the other widely released films, said Don Harris, president of domestic distribution for Paramount. In a small number of theaters, “My Week with Marilyn,” starring Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe opened with $1.8 million from 244 screens from Friday through Sunday. Critics have praised Williams’ performance in The Weinstein Co. film and mentioned her as an Academy Award contender for the role. Walt Disney Co released “The Muppets.” Privately held Summit Entertainment released “Breaking Dawn - Part 1.” “Arthur Christmas” was distributed by Sony, and Hugo was released by Paramount, a unit of Viacom Inc. Time Warner unit Warner Bros. distributed “Happy Feet Two.”  (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Bill Trott)",11272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/boxoffice/update-1-breaking-dawn-tops-holiday-weekend-box-office-idUSN1E7AQ08P20111127
267,DIS,"Early ""lost"" Disney cartoon discovered in UK","LONDON (Reuters) - A lost Walt Disney cartoon that pre-dated Mickey Mouse has been discovered in a British film archive and will be offered for auction in Los Angeles on December 14. “Hungry Hobos” was one of 26 episodes featuring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a character created by Disney and cartoonist Ub Iwerks in 1927 for Universal Studios. The first production featuring Oswald, widely considered a prototype to the more famous Mickey Mouse, was rejected by the Hollywood studio, but the second, “Trolley Troubles,” kick-started a successful series. Robert Dewar, commercial director of Huntley Film Archives, one of Britain’s biggest independent film libraries, said he and colleagues found the only known surviving copy of Hungry Hobos during a routine cataloguing exercise earlier this year. “We’ve got more films than you can imagine,” he told Reuters, adding that only about 40,000 of the archive’s 80,000 films are fully accounted for. “We thought this one (Hungry Hobos) looked a little bit suspicious.” Amanda Huntley of the archive added: “When we checked this film we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. For an archive, finding a lost masterpiece is incredible — you just don’t think it will happen to you.” Dewar said the archive intended to use the money raised by the sale to help preserve its library. Bonhams auctioneers expect the 5 minute, 21 second film to fetch $30-40,000 when it goes under the hammer. The character of Oswald has appeared in several guises over the years, but the significance of Hungry Hobos was that it is part of the first series associated directly with Disney. According to Dewar, adding to the film’s importance was the fact that it aired on May 14, 1928, one day before the first trial screening of Mickey Mouse. It is one of several episodes of the original series still thought to be lost. In 1928, Disney asked Universal for more money but his request was turned down, prompting his decision to part ways with the studio. Iwerks went with him, and they developed their most famous creation, Mickey Mouse, a version of Oswald. “Oswald is a proto-Mickey,” said Dewar. “If you see him, you see the same shape of the head, the ears, the mannerisms.” He added that Walt Disney Co., the global entertainment company, was aware of the discovery.",11282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-discovery/early-lost-disney-cartoon-discovered-in-uk-idUSTRE7AR11N20111128

274,DIS,Report card 2011: Disney moved to cut costs with fewer films,"LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - This is the sixth in TheWrap’s series of Studio Report Cards. Walt Disney Pictures Grade: B- Disney downsized the number of films it released this year by 20 percent to just 14, yet global box-office revenue wasn’t that far off from 2010 ($3.36 billion vs. $3.77 billion). The studio’s one big hit, “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,” was somewhat offset by the costly failure of Robert Zemeckis’s “Mars Needs Moms.” Burdened the last few years by a flurry of ambitious films that were undermined by their costs — “A Christmas Carol,” “Prince of Persia” and “Tangled” — Disney downshifted in 2011 to a lower-risk strategy. The studio reduced its slate from 19 films to 14, with four of the titles provided from DreamWorks under its distribution deal. And the studio experimented — unsuccessfully — with low-cost production models, such as the youth-oriented “Prom,” which was shot for just $8 million (but only grossed $10.1 million). “One of Disney’s sins in the past was releasing too many movies,” Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities, told TheWrap. Unlike 2010, when the studio boasted two titles that grossed more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office, “Alice in Wonderland” and “Toy Story 3,” Disney had only one major hit this year in “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.” It also had one significant flop, with Robert Zemeckis’s “Mars Needs Moms” — which was put into motion before Rich Ross took over as chairman of the studio in October 2009 — grossing just $39 million on a $150 million production budget. Through last week, Disney’s film slate had grossed $3.36 billion globally, down about 12 percent from 2010’s $3.77 billion despite a 20 percent decline in the number of movies released. Overall profit for Disney’s studio entertainment operations for the fiscal year ending October 1 — a tally that also includes home video — decreased 11 percent to $618 million on revenue of $6.4 billion. With the international box office driving titles like “Pirates of the Caribbean” — the “On Stranger Tides” installment took in a whopping $802.8 million in foreign theatrical revenue — Disney’s production engine is now focused on making a limited number of titles that have global appeal across theatrical, home entertainment and merchandising channels. “We’re banking on something consumers can enjoy on a global basis, and stories that are universally appealing to a very broad, diverse, international audience,” Disney’s distribution chief, Dave Hollis, told TheWrap. Beyond “Pirates,” Disney had several other very recognizable titles that connected with that broad, global audiences. “Cars 2,” for one, grossed $551.2 million worldwide. “‘Cars 2’ did decent numbers, but more importantly, it stimulated licensed merchandise sales,” said Marla Backer, an analyst at Hudson Square Research. (The “Cars” franchise has moved nearly $10 billion worth of associated toys, clothes and other licensed merchandise since the franchise kicked off in 2006.) A 3D re-release of the 17-year-old “Lion King” took in $492.1 million worldwide on a conversion cost of less than $10 million. The re-release was so successful, Disney has already slotted similar 3D premieres for “Beauty and the Beast” and “Finding Nemo” next year. “I don’t think anyone expected it to do as well as it did,” Backer said. “It was found money.” And Disney’s “Muppets” — produced for $45 million, a very modest amount compared to the $260 million the studio spent last year on “Tangled” — is now ready to enter the international market after a successful North American release. Among movies based on less recognizable brands, Disney enjoyed a sleeper hit with the CG-rendered “Gnomeo and Juliet” grossing $194 million worldwide. The first year under the studio’s distribution arrangement with DreamWorks yielded solid results, with “The Help” grossing $201.9 million worldwide and awards consideration on a modest $25 million negative cost. Less spectacularly, Shawn Levy’s futuristic action film “Real Steel” grossed $276.4 million worldwide on a $125 million budget, and D.J. Caruso’s sci-fi film “I Am Number Four” recouped $144.5 million globally on a $60 million budget. The studio had few outright duds this year, but the one it did have, “Mars Needs Moms,” was a doozy. With Disney CFO James Rasulo signaling out the film’s performance as “very disappointing” during Disney’s second-quarter earnings call, the notorious movie led the company to shutter producer Robert Zemeckis’ ImageMovers Digital in March. Indeed, Disney has moved aggressively on many fronts to control costs. The studio halted preparations for the Gore Verbinski-directed “Lone Ranger” when the budget for the Johnny Depp adaptation of the TV series began to make the studio nervous. Now with a downsized budget, the film is back on. While Disney executives expect the cost-cutting strategy to improve its bottom line, not everyone is thrilled with the film division’s scaled-back ambition. “It’s unfortunate the movie business is less important than it was to Disney,” Harrigan said. “ Iger looks at it as just one part of its business.” As for the 2012 slate, Disney’s biggest expected moneymaker is “The Avengers,” the first Marvel film released by the studio since it acquired the comic-book company two years ago. Harrigan said it could be the year’s most successful film among all studios. Buzz for the first movie has been building for years. Audiences, he added, have been introduced to major characters in “Avengers” via “Iron Man” and “Captain America: The First Avenger,” and lesser-known characters such as Nick Fury and Hawkeye via cameos in “Captain America” and “Thor.” “We’re expecting it will be an absolute phenomenon,” Hollis said. “I don’t know who doesn’t know about ‘The Avengers’ at this point.” Success is also predicted for “Brave,” the latest product from Pixar, which, like Marvel, has massive international appeal. “Brave” will be released in 3D, followed by another computer-animated 3D release, “Wreck-It Ralph,” in November. “Disney’s animation business is still a crown jewel,” Harrigan said. Beyond those films, though, Disney faces some risks in 2012. The studio is so confident in Andrew Stanton’s $250 million sci-fi epic “John Carter” that it is releasing the film in the soft month of March. But response to the movie’s trailers has not been strong. “I don’t think they’re going to have a great year,” Harrigan said. But, he added, “I think they’re doing the right thing in focusing on the major franchises and their brand extensions.”",12202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-2011/report-card-2011-disney-moved-to-cut-costs-with-fewer-films-idUSTRE7BJ17H20111220

Disney shares fell 1.8 percent to $40.28 in after-hours trading. The operator of television networks ESPN and ABC, a movie studio and theme parks, posted fiscal first-quarter revenue of $10.8 billion, a 1 percent gain from a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $11.2 billion for the quarter. Disney’s studio division had a surprise hit with modestly budgeted film “The Muppets”, but suffered from tough comparisons with home video sales for “Cars 2” versus the smash “Toy Story 3” a year earlier. The studio’s revenue fell 16 percent in the quarter to $1.6 billion. Revenue at media networks, the company’s largest unit, gained 3 percent to $4.8 billion. Within that unit, broadcasting saw a 7 percent dip and margins fell, Gabelli & Co analyst Brett Harriss said. “That’s the biggest negative that I saw,” he said. The theme parks unit, which like media networks have held up through a struggling economy, rose 10 percent. “Disney continues to exhibit pricing power, which shows the strength and competitive advantage of that business,” Morningstar analyst Michael Corty said.

283,DIS,Disney earnings beat despite shaky economy,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) quarterly revenue fell short of Wall Street’s expectations after the movie studio put in a poor showing, but profit grew at a faster-than-expected 12 percent clip as media networks and theme parks held strong in an uncertain economy. Disney shares fell 1.8 percent to $40.28 in after-hours trading. The operator of television networks ESPN and ABC, a movie studio and theme parks, posted fiscal first-quarter revenue of $10.8 billion, a 1 percent gain from a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $11.2 billion. Analysts say the largest U.S. media corporation is searching for new ways to grow its ABC television unit. The results came a day after news broke that Disney’s ABC television unit was talking with Spanish-language broadcaster Univision UVN.UL about creating a 24-hour English-language news channel aimed at the growing Hispanic market in the United States. Disney CEO Bob Iger would not comment on the reports during a conference call with analysts. But he said the company “has an interest in seeing that ABC News continues to flourish, and giving it an opportunity to look for and create some growth opportunities on its own.” Disney reported a fiscal first-quarter net income gain of 12 percent to $1.5 billion or 80 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 71 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Jointly operating a channel with Univision could help ABC reduce news-gathering costs, and offset flagging business. Revenue at Disney’s broadcast unit fell 7 percent in the quarter to $1.5 billion. Iger has made several moves to boost ABC’s bottom line. In 2010, the unit shed about a quarter of its staff or 400 people. Long-time chief David Westin left that year, replaced by broadcast news veteran and “Charlie St. Cloud” author Ben Sherwood. Westin’s departure was preceded by the sudden and unexpected resignation of ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson. ABC News previously explored deals to partner with CNN or Bloomberg TV, but the talks never got off the ground. ABC News also made eyebrow-raising moves like hiring Christiane Amanpour in the wake of the employee cull at a reported $2 million to $3 million to anchor Sunday political talk show “This Week.” She left that post late last year and now divides her time between reporting for ABC and CNN. The company also has been trying to boost the movie studio’s performance. Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said the 16 percent drop in quarterly revenue to $1.6 billion reflected the company’s strategy of reducing the number of films it produces to help build profits. Operating income at the studio grew 10 percent. Disney had a surprise hit in the quarter with modestly budgeted film “The Muppets”, but suffered from tough comparisons with hits “Tangled and “Tron: Legacy” a year earlier. Revenue at media networks, the company’s largest unit, gained 3 percent to $4.8 billion with growth at sports powerwhouse ESPN and the Disney Channels. The theme parks unit, which like media networks have held up through a struggling economy, rose 10 percent to $3.2 billion. “Disney continues to exhibit pricing power, which shows the strength and competitive advantage of that business,” Morningstar analyst Michael Corty said. The company will launch Disney’s fourth cruise ship — the Disney Fantasy — in March. The new ship will not generate meaningful revenue until the fiscal third quarter, Rasulo said. Analysts have pointed to uncertainty now surrounding the luxury cruise industry after Carnival Corp’s (CCL.N) Costa Concordia capsized off the coast of Italy. Rival Royal Caribbean Cruise Ltd (RCL.N) has warned it will face a sharp drop-off in new cruise bookings because of that wreck. Cases of the norovirus stomach illness also have been reported recently on two of Carnival’s Princess cruise ships and one Royal Caribbean ship.

286,DIS,TEXT-Fitch rates Walt Disney Co proposed offering,"Feb 9 - Fitch Ratings has assigned an ‘A’ rating to The Walt Disney Company’s (Disney) proposed offering of benchmark five-, and 10-year 	 senior unsecured notes. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full rating list is 	 shown below. 	 	 The notes will be issued under Disney’s existing indenture dated Sept. 24, 2001,	 and will be pari passu with all existing debt. Similar to existing bonds, there 	 are no financial covenants. Proceeds will be used for general corporate 	 purposes. Fitch expects the company to use the proceeds of this issuance to 	 term-out a portion of its current commercial paper (CP) outstanding. 	 	 The ratings and Outlook reflect Disney’s ample financial flexibility, 	 underpinned by strong free cash flow generation, total leverage around 1.4 times	 (x) and net leverage (excluding international parks and the minority stake in 	 ESPN, and including investments in A&E;/Lifetime) below 1.0x. The company faces 	 $2 billion of maturities in calendar year (CY) 2012, including a $1.25 billion 	 note due on March 1. While these maturities could easily be repaid with cash on 	 hand and free cash flow, Fitch expects, and the ratings incorporate, that Disney	 will use its cash for internal investments, share buybacks, and moderate M&A; 	 activity rather than debt reduction.	 	 Ratings reflect Disney’s consistent ability, surpassing that of its peers, to 	 consistently leverage and monetize its brands and characters across all aspects 	 of its business, which benefits the company’s operating profile and free cash 	 flow generation. Fitch expects this ability to continue, given the company’s 	 vast resources to attract and develop content and talent. 	 	 Ratings concerns center on the cyclicality of the company’s businesses, 	 particularly Parks & Resorts (consumer spending) and Broadcasting (local and 	 national advertising). Should macroeconomic pressures intensify, Fitch expects 	 these cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure in fiscal year (FY) 2012 	 but that the company’s credit and financial profile will likely remain within 	 current ratings. 	 	 The ratings also factor in the emergence of over-the-top (OTT), television 	 content that has increased the risk customers will turn to such alternatives in 	 lieu of traditional pay-TV subscriptions. Fitch sees several mitigants to 	 widespread cancellation of traditional pay-TV subscriptions. Importantly, those 	 networks that continue to be demanded by consumers will remain very profitable 	 and generate substantial free cash flow. Fitch views Disney’s recent omnibus 	 distribution agreement with Comcast as evidence of its belief that providers of 	 in-demand, high quality content will continue to monetize it in incremental ways	 and thrive amid, rather than be pressured by, the proliferation of alternative 	 distribution platforms. 	 	 Disney’s liquidity at Dec. 31, 2011 was solid and consisted of $3.7 billion of 	 cash ($625 million of which was held at the International Theme Parks), as well 	 as $4.45 billion (net of $47 million letters of credit) available under two 	 revolving credit facilities (RCF) of $2.25 billion each; the first matures in 	 February 2013 and the second in February 2015. These facilities backstop 	 Disney’s CP program. Liquidity is further supported by the company’s annual free	 cash flow generation, which Fitch expects to dip to less than $2 billion in 	 FY2012 given a large project-based high capex outlay, but which is expected to 	 return to more than $3.5 billion beginning FY2013.	 	 Total debt at Dec. 31, 2011 was $14.4 billion and consisted of:	 	 —$607 million of CP;	 —$10 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from 2012-2093;	 —$2.1 billion of debt related to Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disney, which 	 is non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption	 that the company would back the loan payments rather than risk hurting its brand	 image by letting these entities default; 	 —$1.6 billion of other domestic and European notes and other debt.	 	 The company’s material maturity schedule could be handled organically if needed,	 given free cash flow expectations. Fitch notes the company’s pension was 69% 	 funded at Oct. 1, 2011 (the last reported date). While annual pension funding 	 obligations could total several hundred million dollars over the next few years,	 they will be more than covered by free cash flow. 	 	 Fitch links the Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of the issuing entities 	 (predominantly based on the lack of any material restrictions on movements of 	 cash between the entities) and treats the unsecured debt of the entire company 	 as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the absence of upstream guarantees from the 	 operating assets and that debt at Disney Enterprises is structurally senior to 	 the holding company debt. However, Fitch does not distinguish the issue ratings 	 at the two entities due to the strong ‘A’ category investment-grade IDR, Fitch’s	 expectations of stable financial policies, and the anticipation that future debt	 will be issued by Walt Disney Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing 	 between the ratings if it viewed there to be heightened risk of the company’s 	 IDR falling to non-investment grade (where Disney Enterprises’ enhanced recovery	 prospects would be more relevant).	 	 Fitch currently maintains the following ratings:	 	 The Walt Disney Company	 —IDR ‘A’;	 —Senior unsecured debt ‘A’;	 —Short-term IDR ‘F1’;	 —Commercial paper ‘F1’.	 	 ABC Inc.	 —IDR ‘A’;	 —Senior unsecured debt ‘A’.	 	 Disney Enterprises, Inc.	 —IDR ‘A’;	 —Senior unsecured debt ‘A’.",2092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA981720120209
287,DIS,"Bridgit Mendler enters ""Secret World of Arriety""","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - In just a few short years, Bridgit Mendler has risen to become one of the Disney Channel’s most popular stars thanks to the success of her series “Good Luck Charlie” and the Disney Channel original movie “Lemonade Mouth.” On Friday, the 19-year old heads to the big screen, voicing the title character of the animated Disney film “The Secret World of Arrietty,” and that has given rise to the idea Mendler may be the next Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez or Demi Lovato. But Mendler, who was born in Washington, D.C. and raised outside of San Francisco, is quick to point out that she’s her own person looking to expand her career in her own way. “I’m not just following a trend. The Disney girls are presented with so many awesome opportunities that it’s something to really take advantage of,” she told Reuters. “Arrietty” is based on Mary Norton’s children’s book series “The Borrowers” where a family of very tiny people live undetected underneath the floorboards of a country house, “borrowing” things they need from human beings. Mendler voices the spirited “borrower” Arrietty who breaks the family rule when she befriends a human boy who moves into the country house. “Arrietty” was originally released as a Japanese film by Studio Ghibli in 2010 and has now been re-recorded in English with Mendler in the title role. Will Arnett, Amy Poehler and Carol Burnett are also among the cast of voices. Mendler even wrote and recorded a song for the film’s soundtrack called “Summertime.” And, like past and present Disney stars such as Cyrus (“Hanna Montana”), Gomez (“The Wizards of Waverly Place”) and Lovato (“Sonny With a Chance”), Mendler now has a record deal with Disney’s Hollywood Records. Her debut pop album is scheduled to come out this summer. “Working with Disney has been such a great way for me to expand my horizons,” Mendler told Reuters. “They really believe in their kids and putting them out there. It feels awesome to have this pedestal that I can work off of.” Mendler came to Disney’s attention as a 14-year-old when she auditioned for a TV pilot. She didn’t get the part, but Disney Channel talent executive Judy Taylor recalls her being “so poised and so smart, it was evident there was real potential.” Disney “tracked” the young actress over the years and in 2009, booked her in a guest starring role on the Jonas Brothers’ series “JONAS.” That was followed up with a character who appeared in nine episodes of “Wizards of Waverly Place.” When Disney was preparing a new show, “Good Luck Charlie” about a teenage girl who creates video diaries of advice for her baby sister, Mendler was brought in for an audition. “We needed an actress who was relatable and accessible but could also talk straight to the camera and then go right back to talking to her family,” said Taylor. “That’s not easy to do but Bridgit made it look effortless. She just nailed it.” The series is currently in production on its third season with Mendler singing the theme song to “Charlie.” Her fan base grew even wider when the teen starred in the Disney Channel original film “Lemonade Mouth,” a musical drama based on the book of the same name. A sequel is now in the works. Though some of her former Disney contemporaries have gone through public battles with addiction (Lovato) or have engaged in questionable behavior (Cyrus), the diplomatic Mendler has nothing but praise for those who came before her. “I think they all have unique ideas of who they want to be in the industry, and I think that’s the way it should be,” she said. “For me, I would be in music regardless of whether I was a Disney girl or not and it’s something I take really seriously.” Mendler cites former Disney male star Shia LaBoeuf as a model for her foray into the future. He starred in the Disney series “Even Stevens” a decade ago and has found success in the “Transformers” and “Indiana Jones” film franchises. “Shia LaBoeuf is a great example of somebody who was able to transition into more serious movie roles,” said Mendler, who recently strayed outside the Disney realm and shot an episode the Fox TV medical drama “House.” “There’s possibilities of doing more adult material without having to be racy with it.

289,DIS,Wrestling scion joins Disney in the ring in China,"Feb 22 (Reuters) - Shane McMahon, the son of pro-wrestling impresario Vince McMahon, will team up with Walt Disney Co to distribute video-on-demand Disney movies in China. The 42-year-old chief executive officer of YOU On Demand Holdings - a joint venture with government-run network CCTV - had previously obtained the rights to distribute movies from Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner, and from Hollywood studio Lionsgate. The latest agreement gives McMahon’s company the rights to offer what it called “officially approved” Disney films both under subscription or through individual transactions, where movies are rented by consumers who watch them on their TV sets. “We are very proud to work with The Walt Disney Company in bringing the best in home entertainment to China,” McMahon said in a statement obtained by Reuters that was prepared for a Wednesday release. McMahon joined YOU On Demand in 2010 after a 21-year career at World Wrestling Entertainment, where he started as a referee under the name Shane Stevens. At one point, he appeared onscreen in a scripted role as a rival wrestling promoter who tried to steal wrestlers from his father. Offscreen, McMahon rose through the ranks at WWE and in 1998 helped create the company’s digital media division. He was executive vice-president of WWE Global Media from 1993 to 2010 and oversaw international TV distribution, event books and digital media in overseas markets.",2222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-china/wrestling-scion-joins-disney-in-the-ring-in-china-idUSL2E8DMCKA20120222
290,DIS,"Disney disputes shareholder report on CEO pay, role","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) defended its executive structure and pay on Thursday after a shareholder governance group criticized Chief Executive Bob Iger’s compensation and his added role as chairman. Disney, in filings with securities regulators, said a report by Institutional Shareholder Services was “deeply flawed and out of touch with shareholder interests.” The entertainment and theme-park company said in October that Iger would remain CEO through March 2015 and take on the additional role of chairman at the company’s annual meeting this month. ISS, in its report, said Disney had “reversed an earlier commitment to independent board leadership without transparency or shareholder input.” The group said the company’s move was “an about-face” from reforms adopted after some shareholders objected in 2004 to former CEO Michael Eisner also holding the chairman’s job. Disney said it made no such commitment. “The board specifically limited its commitment to a post-decision explanation”, Disney said on Thursday, adding it had also promised to name a lead independent director. The company said the idea of extending Iger’s term and having him serve as chairman was “initiated by the board and not by Mr. Iger.” The board acted to “secure Mr. Iger’s leadership through his expected retirement in 2016 to provide for an effective, seamless succession,” the company said. On pay, ISS urged shareholders to oppose Iger’s compensation in a non-binding vote. ISS said Iger’s pay “has risen sharply over the past five years despite lackluster shareholder returns” and ranked “among the highest in the S&P; 500.” Disney countered that the company had delivered “exceptional total shareholder return” during Iger’s six years in the company’s top job starting in October 2005. Shares of Disney rose about 57 percent from October 1, 2005, through the end of 2011. The S&P; 500, by comparison, inched up 1.4 percent over the same period.

293,DIS,UPDATE 1-'Lorax' beats Disney Mars epic at box office,"* ‘Lorax’ takes $39.1 mln domestically * Disney’s ‘Carter’ tops $100 mln globally * Weekend up 9 pct vs. last year By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, March 11 (Reuters) - Dr. Seuss movie “The Lorax” stayed firmly planted at No. 1 on box office charts over the weekend, easily trumping the debut of Walt Disney Co’s  expensive sci-fi flick “John Carter.” The animated “Lorax” notched its second win in a row with $39.1 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales from Friday through Sunday, according to studio estimates released on Sunday. “John Carter” opened in second place with $30.6 million,  a low number for a hoped-for blockbuster. While the 3D space adventure grossed more than double that amount overseas, Disney is left with a big hole to fill just to break even. The film cost an estimated $250 million to produce, plus tens of millions more to market. “John Carter” added $70.6 million from international markets, for a global total of $101.2 million. Movies typically take in their biggest haul over the first weekend and see sales slip by at least 40 percent the following week. Studios split box-office receipts with theaters. Heading into the weekend, Wall Street analysts predicted Disney would lose tens of millions of dollars on the film. Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould on Friday estimated a $165 million loss. Audiences gave the movie a “B+” in polling by survey firm CinemaScore, and domestic sales gained 25 percent from Friday to Saturday, said Dave Hollis, Disney’s executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution. While “we appreciate the larger economics of the film, we are encouraged by how the film has been received” by audiences,  Hollis said. “John Carter” is based on a century-old book by Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of Tarzan. The movie stars Taylor Kitsch from TV’s “Friday Night Lights” as an ex-military captain who is transported to Mars and tries to end the planet’s civil war. “John Carter” is the first live-action movie from Andrew Stanton, director of Oscar-winning animated mega-hits “Wall-E” and “Finding Nemo” from Disney’s Pixar unit. Critics were split on the film. Fifty percent gave the movie a positive rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. “The Lorax,” an environmental tale about a fuzzy orange creature that guards trees, held strong in its second weekend. The movie dropped 44 percent from a week earlier. Total worldwide sales for the big-screen adaptation of Seuss’ 1971 children’s book now stand at $123.7 million. Overall North American (U.S. and Canadian) ticket sales outpaced 2011 for the 10th straight weekend, beating the same frame last year by 8.7 percent. Year-to-date ticket sales are running 18.3 percent ahead of 2011, according to the box office division of Hollywood.com. Comedy “Project X,” about three high-school kids who plan a party that spins out of control, pulled together $11.6 million domestically. That landed the movie in third place during its second weekend in theaters. Horror flick “Silent House” had a quiet debut, pulling in $7 million and taking fourth place. The movie stars Elizabeth Olsen as a young woman trapped in a lakeside house and unable to contact the outside world. A spokeswoman for distributor Open Road Films said the movie would be profitable for the company. In fifth place, military drama “Act of Valor” brought in $7.0 million. The film has grossed $56.1 million after three weekends in theaters. New comedy “A Thousand Words” starring Eddie Murphy found little to talk about, opening with $6.4 million domestically and finishing in sixth place. Distributor Paramount had forecast an opening around $5 million or $6 million for the movie, which was produced by Dreamworks with a budget of about $40 million. The movie bombed with critics, earning 37 unanimously negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences gave the movie a “B-“ in CinemaScore polling. Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures released “Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax.” Time Warner Inc released “Project X.” “A Thousand Words” was distributed by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom Inc. “Silent House” was released by Open Road Films, a joint venture between theater owners Regal Entertainment Group and AMC Entertainment Inc . Privately held Relativity Media distributed “Act of Valor” in the United States, and Alliance Films released the movie in Canada.",3112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/boxoffice/update-1-lorax-beats-disney-mars-epic-at-box-office-idUSL2E8EB0LT20120311
294,DIS,Disney CEO Iger adds chairman role,"KANSAS CITY (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Bob Iger added the post of chairman on Tuesday despite objections from a governance group and state treasurer about the dual roles. Disney made the announcement after a board meeting that followed its annual shareholder meeting in Kansas City, where Iger and nine other directors won re-election. The media and theme park company also said it named Orin Smith independent lead director. Smith, the former CEO of Starbucks Corp, joined Disney’s board in 2006. Iger’s additional post recalled for some Disney shareholders the turbulence surrounding former CEO Michael Eisner, who was stripped by the board of his chairmanship in 2004 following a campaign by Walt Disney’s nephew, Roy Disney, to drive him from the company. The board’s decision to put both the CEO and chairman jobs in Iger’s hands was announced in October, when the company extended his term as CEO through March 2015. He was awarded the chairman’s job through June 2016, following chairman John Pepper’s retirement on Tuesday. The dual roles sparked objections from a corporate governance group, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which advises clients who vote their own shares. The state of Connecticut, which holds more than 642,000 Disney shares worth about $27 million in its retirement plans, also voiced concern. ISS argued that Disney had reversed a commitment to seek shareholder input before combining the CEO and chairman jobs. Disney shares closed almost 4 percent higher at $44.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier, in a statement before the meeting, said letting Iger hold both titles was “a regressive policy that could impair the board’s role to oversee executive management on behalf of shareholders.” ISS and Nappier called on shareholders to vote against the four directors on the nominating committee that recommended Iger take on the chairman’s role — JLabs CEO Judith Estrin; Potbelly Sandwich Works CEO Aylwin Lewis; private equity investor Robert Matschullat; and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. In a response to ISS, Disney said 68 percent of Standard & Poor’s top 100 companies have combined CEO and chair posts, and it had made no promise to seek advance shareholder input on the decision. Preliminary votes showed shareholders re-elected all of the company’s 10 board members, Disney said in a statement. Shareholders also approved compensation for Disney executives in a non-binding vote. ISS had urged a “no” vote on executive pay, arguing that Iger’s compensation had risen sharply over the past five years while the company produced “lackluster” returns for investors. Disney countered that it had delivered “exceptional total shareholder return” during Iger’s six years in the company’s top job starting in October 2005.

298,DIS,Disney projects $200 million 'John Carter' loss,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co shares fell 1 percent in after hour trading on Monday after the company said it expects mega-budget science-fiction movie “John Carter” will lose about $200 million in the current quarter. The company issued the forecast in a statement that projected the studio division would report an overall operating loss of $80 million to $120 million in the fiscal second quarter that ends March 31. Disney shares dropped about 1 percent to $43 in after-hours trading from an earlier close of $43.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. So far, the film about a former military captain who is transported to Mars, has generated $184 million in ticket sales worldwide. That is far shy from the audience needed to earn back the movie’s estimated $250 million production budget, plus tens of millions more that Disney spent on advertising. Even before the movie opened, Wall Street analysts had projected “John Carter” would lose tens of millions of dollars as industry tracking showed little interest in the film. “John Carter” opened on March 9 and took in about $30 million over its first three days at U.S. and Canadian theaters, finishing the weekend in second place behind family film “The Lorax.” ",3192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-disney-carter/disney-projects-200-million-john-carter-loss-idUSBRE82I11E20120319

300,DIS,"Megabomb ""John Carter"" may be Hollywood's biggest loser","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Ultra competitive movie studios rarely want to sit atop this box office list. When the Walt Disney Co said on Monday that it expected its sci-fi movie “John Carter” to lose about $200 million, it very likely shot the intergalactic box office bomb to the top of Hollywood’s biggest loser chart. If so - and box office math is always a little tricky in Tinseltown - the megaflop would achieve iconic status by surpassing the 1995 Geena Davis-Matthew Modine pirate flick “Cutthroat Island” that the Guinness Book of World Records lists as the biggest bomb of all-time. That movie lost $147 million, according to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, which also puts the MGM film at the top of its list. Infamous misfires like director Ron Howard’s “The Alamo,” Eddie Murphy’s “The Adventures of Pluto Nash”, the Matthew McConaughey-Penelope Cruz action film “Sahara” and director Robert Zemeckis’ 2011 animated film “Mars Needs Moms” all passed the dubious $140 million loss threshold, according to Wikipedia. Of course, any movie box office list is subject to serious interpretation. The Wikipedia list, for instance, has converted the film’s ticket sales to inflation-adjusted 2012 dollars, but includes only worldwide box office and not DVD or TV sales. “Then there’s the issue of Hollywood accounting,” said Keith Simanton, managing editor of movie data site IMDb. “You never really know what a budget is for any of these films because Hollywood isn’t very open with its numbers. Directionally, though, these are definitely near the top of any list of worst films.” Sometimes it’s not revenues that sink a film. Director Andrew Stanton’s movie has a reasonably strong $184 million worldwide box office, so far. The key problem for “John Carter” was that it cost more than $350 million to produce and market, according to industry sources, who say even that number is likely understated. There can be no doubt “John Carter” will go down in history as a box office bomb, and with its entrance into Hollywood’s Hall of Shame, it is interesting to note that six of the top 15 movie misfires have been made since 2005, when Hollywood has been in high gear with pricey, special effects budgets. In 2011 alone, there were two big losers. Disney released “Mars Needs Moms,” for which it took a write-down of at least $70 million, on a film that had a worldwide box office of only $38.9 million. Warner Brothers released its take on DC Comics’ “Green Lantern,” starring Ryan Reynolds as the keeper of the green ring. That film lost $108.6 million, according to the Wikipedia list. “The studios are just spending too much money and there’s just not the box office there to support it,” said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com. “John Carter’s’ bloated budget would have required it to generate worldwide tickets sales of more than $600 million to break even, Dergarabedian said, a height reached by only 63 films in the history of moviemaking.

301,DIS,Court bars challenge to bundled cable channels,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Television programmers and distributors do not have to face a lawsuit that sought to compel them to sell cable channels separately to consumers, instead of in multi-channel packages, a U.S. appeals court ruled. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday found that the plaintiffs - cable and satellite TV subscribers - failed to state an antitrust claim against Walt Disney, Fox Entertainment Group Inc, Comcast Corp and several other companies. The plaintiffs intended to seek class-action status. Maxwell Blecher, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he was very disappointed in the decision and that his clients will likely seek review before a larger 9th Circuit panel. “It is so wrong,” Blecher said of the ruling. Glenn Pomerantz, an attorney for Fox, said the company was “extremely pleased” with the ruling. “The agreements between television programmers and cable and satellite operators do not injure competition in any way,” Pomerantz said. “They are totally legal and justifiable.” Representatives for Disney and Comcast could not immediately be reached. The lawsuit, filed in a California federal court, alleged that television programmers exploit their market power by requiring distributors to sell less desirable cable channels, along with select “must have” channels. Those business practices impair competition among distributors for consumer business, the plaintiffs alleged. The lower court dismissed the lawsuit, and on Friday, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel unanimously affirmed. “The complaint does not allege that programmers’ practice of selling ‘must-have’ and low-demand channels in packages excludes other sellers of low-demand channels from the market,” the court wrote, “or that this practice raises barriers to entry into the programming market.” The case in the 9th Circuit is Rob Brantley et al, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v.

Ross, named to the job in October 2009, was never able to duplicate the success he enjoyed as president of the Disney Channel, where he was credited with creating monster franchises that included “High School Musical” and “Hannah Montana.” “I no longer believe that the Chairman role is the right professional fit for me,” Ross told his staff in an email. Disney will not immediately name a new head for its studio, a source familiar with the matter said. In a statement, Disney CEO Bob Iger said: “For more than a decade, Rich Ross’ creative instincts, business acumen and personal integrity have driven results in key businesses for Disney. ... I appreciate his countless contributions throughout his entire career at Disney and expect he will have tremendous success in whatever he chooses to do next.” Ross kept a low profile at the Disney Channel and never adapted to Hollywood glad handing, according to a source with knowledge of his style. At the April 11 premiere for Disney’s big budget film “The Avengers,” the studio chief stood off to the side while the movie’s stars chatted up other executives. Ross lost the confidence of Disney’s big name producers, including Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced its “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies, said one person with knowledge of the relationship. Last summer, Ross shut down production of Bruckheimer’s big budget film “The Lone Ranger” over budget issues and cut its $250 million budget to $215 million The studio executive took the heat for letting the “John Carter” budget rise to $250 million from $200 million, said one person with knowledge of Disney thinking, and for its lackluster marketing effort. Ross killed another big budget film, a remake of “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,” but let “John Carter” production begin. Disney said in March it expected the film to lose about $200 million and to saddle its studio with $80 million to $120 million in operating losses. The swiftness of Ross’ resignation leaves Disney without an obvious successor for the job. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and Ross’ lieutenant, Walt Disney Studios president Alan Bergman, are long shots to replace Ross. Disney will likely look for a candidate outside its house. Ross “was a superstar at the Disney Channel, and the results at the studio have not been exceptional,” said Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould. Still, he said Ross’ exit was a surprise given his earlier success in Disney’s cable business. Ross joined Disney Channel in 1996 as a programming and production executive and was promoted to president of the cable channel in 2004. His success at the Disney Channel made him a rising star in the company and eventually led to his being hand-picked by Iger to replace long-time chairman Dick Cook, whom Iger forced out, as head of its film division. Ross had few big hits during his tenure. “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” was a global smash, but part of an established franchise. He also made waves when he picked a Hollywood outsider, M.T. Carney, to run film marketing for Disney. She left the studio earlier this year just as “John Carter” was completed. Ironically, Ross could have his biggest hit when “The Avengers” is released in the United States on May 4. The film, featuring action stars from Disney’s Marvel subsidiary, is expected to be one of the year’s biggest hits. Opening weekend sales may reach $155 million in the United States and Canada, according to Boxoffice.com. For investors, the departure of Ross should have little impact, analyst Gould said. Disney’s results are driven by its much-larger theme-park and cable network businesses. Disney shares gained 27 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $42.35 on the New York Stock Exchange.

305,DIS,"""Avengers"" muscles to record $200 million in debut","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “The Avengers” proved that five superheroes are better than one by bursting into Hollywood’s record books with a massive $200.3 million in ticket sales over its opening weekend in U.S. and Canadian theaters, kicking off Hollywood’s summer movie season with a bang. The domestic debut for the big-budget, effects-filled movie from Disney’s Marvel studios sped past last summer’s “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows - Part 2,” which opened with $169.2 million in its first weekend, according to Box Office Mojo. In March, “The Hunger Games” opened with $152.5 million, the fourth largest opening in box office history. “The Avengers,” which reunites Marvel comic heroes Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk and Black Widow, has collected $641.8 million since it opened in international markets on April 25. “We keep thinking we have a sense of what this movie can do, or will do, and every time we get a report it does even better,” said Dave Hollis, Disney’s executive vice-president of distribution. “This is very satisfying, to say the least.” Disney’s aggressive marketing, which included promotions aimed at women that included sending stars to “The View” daytime talk show, resulted in women making up 40 percent of the audience for the action film, according to Disney’s survey. Half the audience was also over 25 years of age, the studio also said. Winner of the past two weekends, Sony’s romantic comedy “Think Like a Man,” slipped to second place with $8 million at North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters, according to Hollywood.com. “Hunger Games,” from Lions Gate Entertainment, took the No. 3 spot in its seventh week in theaters, with $5.7 million, and has collected $380.7 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters during its run. Warner Brothers’ “The Lucky One” landed in fourth place with $5.5 million, and the animated film “The Pirates! Band of Misfits” from Sony finished in fifth place with $5.4 million. The undisputed success of “Avengers” brought Disney the type of redemption that Hollywood loves to put on screen. In March, Disney released the expensive sci-fi adventure film “John Carter,” one of the biggest flops in box office history. The company said it expects to lose up to $200 million on that film. “Avengers” is the first Marvel film released by Disney since the media and theme park giant purchased Marvel Entertainment Inc in 2009 for $4 billion, a move to expand its appeal to boys with a stable of superheroes. Disney would not say whether it plans to make a sequel. Sequels to films based on the Thor and Iron Man characters are scheduled for next year and Captain America in 2014. About 52 percent of “The Avengers” ticket sales came from higher-priced 3D tickets, Disney said. The film sold more than $15 million in tickets on 275 digital-only large-screen IMAX theaters, IMAX said, which it said would tie it with “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows - Part 2” for its highest grossing opening weekend. The first weekend in May kicks off Hollywood’s summer movie-going season, a four-month period typically filled with big-budget action movies and sequels. Coming movies include Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises,” “The Amazing Spider-Man,” “Men in Black 3,” and “Battleship.” ",5062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-boxoffice/avengers-muscles-to-record-200-million-in-debut-idUSBRE84508Q20120506

It also has a silent partner in Viacom’s Paramount Pictures, which stands to get a healthy payday even though the studio didn’t spend a cent to produce or market the film. Paramount already collected $57.5 million in April, when the film was released internationally. And it stands to collect 8 percent of the millions that the film will earn in theaters, on DVD, and when it is watched on the Internet, according to two people with knowledge of the deal. Under a 2005 distribution agreement between Paramount and Marvel, Paramount receives a distribution fee for the theatrical distribution of “The Avengers” as well as its distribution of its home video, Internet and TV rights. That agreement transferred to Disney, when Disney acquired Marvel for $4 billion in 2009. Disney and Paramount agreed in 2010 to amend that agreement, giving Disney the rights to distribute Marvel-produced “The Avengers” and “Iron Man 3,” the second sequel to the 2008 film that Paramount distributes. That agreement stipulated that Disney would pay Paramount a $115 million advance against future fees that Paramount would have earned. Half of that fee was paid when Disney released “The Avengers” in international markets. Spokesmen for Disney and Paramount would not comment. Paramount does not have rights to merchandise from the Marvel movies, and Iger told investors after the deal closed that he signed the getting the movie rights allows he to rev up Disney’s marketing machine. “Not only will we distribute it and market it, but we know that Marvel is working really hard with the cooperation of a number of entities at Disney to turn The Avengers into a true franchise,” he said on the earnings call. Studios and theater owners generally split ticket sales 50-50, meaning that Disney has collected $320.9 million based on “The Avengers” $641.8 million in worldwide ticket sales. Paramount’s $25.7 million take would be applied against the pre-paid fee from Disney. The two sides also agreed that “The Avengers” would appear on the Epix online and premium TV service that Paramount owns with Lions Gate Entertainment and the MGM studio. That’s a big boost for the nearly three-year-old channel. Disney is obligated to show most of its movies on the Starz pay channel. How large Paramount’s take will be depends on how big a hit “The Avengers” becomes. The deal gets even better for Paramount in 2013, when Disney is scheduled to release the third Iron Man.

310,DIS,"Disney earnings rise despite ""John Carter"" loss","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s quarterly earnings beat Wall Street expectations as profit rose 21 percent despite a loss from the science fiction film bomb “John Carter.” Strong attendance at theme parks and higher advertising revenue at cable networks, including sports powerhouse ESPN, helped drive quarterly growth. The earnings report followed a massive opening weekend for “The Avengers,” a superhero movie that set an industry record with ticket sales of $207.4 million over its first weekend. An “Avengers” movie sequel is in the works, Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts. The company’s film studio needed a hit after “Carter,” a $250 million production that dragged the company’s studio unit to an operating loss of $84 million for the fiscal second quarter. Studio chief Rich Ross stepped down April 13 after the film flopped. Despite the studio loss, Disney posted fiscal second quarter earnings of $1.1 billion and a 6 percent increase in revenue to $9.629 billion. Adjusted earnings per share rose 18 percent to 58 cents. Analysts on average had expected 55 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Disney shares rose 1.7 percent to $45.10 in after-hours trade, up from an earlier close of $44.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. As in recent quarters, Disney’s earnings were boosted by its media unit, which includes ESPN and ABC. Operating earnings in that unit increased 13 percent to $1.7 billion in the latest quarter. Visitors kept filling Disney theme parks, and the Disneyland resort in California set a second-quarter attendance record, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said. Earnings at the theme park unit rose 53 percent to $222 million. “You’ve got a parks recovery that’s underway, and you have a cable network business that’s best in class. It showed good growth on the top-line,” said Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible, who rates Disney a “buy” with a $49 price target. At the ABC television network, ad rates rose 6 percent, Rasulo said. In the current quarter, ad pricing is running 20 percent higher than rates it got during the “upfront” selling season last spring, he said. Looking ahead, Iger said he expected “a very strong upfront marketplace” after the network pitches its new shows to advertisers next week. The quarterly results do not include the staggering results from “Avengers,” the Marvel superhero movie that has already pulled in $702.2 million around the globe. Since the opening, “Avengers” merchandise has flown off shelves at stores and Disney parks, CEO Bob Iger told analysts. Some products have sold out, and the company is working to meet demand, he said. “Interest is clearly keen wherever our Marvel characters are touching the public,” he said. Disney’s ABC News unit and Univision also said on May 7 that they would create an English language cable channel aimed at the booming Hispanic market, a bid to expand its news operation that it struggled for years to find. Iger said Disney was “excited about the opportunity” to reach the growing Hispanic market. But he said the company made a “relatively modest” investment in the project that will yield a “relatively small” impact on the company’s overall business.

317,DIS,"Disney at life-high on profit rise, Avengers success","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) shares rose to a life-high after the company reported a rise in quarterly profit despite its science fiction film John Carter bombing, and announced a sequel to its hugely successful superhero flick, The Avengers. Shares of the company rose as much as 3 percent to $45.80 on Wednesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. They were later up more than 1.5 percent at $44.97. RBC, Barclays and at least five other brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, citing the strong debut of The Avengers, which had the biggest weekend opening in film history, and the company’s announcement of a sequel on Tuesday. Disney’s second-quarter profit was driven by strong attendance at its theme parks and higher advertising revenue at its cable networks, including ESPN. The success of The Avengers has changed the company’s mixed track record, brought on by flops like Mars Needs Moms and John Carter, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Bank said in a note, raising his price target on the stock to $50 from $45. Macquarie Equities Research analyst Tim Nollen said The Avengers more than makes up for the bombing of John Carter, with a $700 million global box office take already, and spawning several more films, consumer merchandise and character theme introductions at Disney’s theme parks. Nollen raised his target on the stock to $50 from $45. However, Susquehanna International Group analyst Vasily Karasyov said the success of The Avengers does not solve long-term challenges like the absence of a growing TV production revenue stream. In April, Disney’s movie studio Chairman Rich Ross resigned under pressure after a less than three-year run that included the release of John Carter, one of the biggest flops in recent Hollywood history.

319,DIS,Disney completes overhaul of consumer products unit,"May 29 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co named new executives to head its publishing and retail divisions, completing an overhaul of its consumer products unit that began shortly after Robert Chapek was named its president. Chapek appointed Andrew Sugerman, who headed Disney’s 36 English-language centers in China, Disney publishing executive vice president. He also elevated Molly Adams and Paul Gainer — Disney Store senior vice presidents — to executive vice presidents in charge of the global retail operation, Disney said. In November, Chapek named Marvel licensing chief Josh Silverman to head Disney’s licensing unit. Disney acquired Marvel in 2009. Adams and Gainer replaced Disney Store president Jim Fielding, whose plans are unknown. Sugerman replaced Russell Hampton, who resigned in April. Disney’s consumer products unit owns and operates 357 Disney stores in North America, Europe and Japan, publishes children’s books and magazines, and licenses Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and other characters. Last year, the unit generated $816 million in operating income, a 21 percent increase, on sales of $3 billion. Chapek was named president of the consumer products unit in September. He replaced Andy Mooney, who resigned.",5292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-consumer/disney-completes-overhaul-of-consumer-products-unit-idUSL1E8GTBYV20120529
320,DIS,Disney Channel to go mobile soon; CEO blasts Dish,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co plans as early as next week to launch a mobile application to let Comcast Corp cable TV subscribers watch the Disney Channel on the go, Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger told investors on Wednesday. Comcast customers will be the first to make use of the app, which would be similar to Disney’s WatchESPN service, which allows cable subscribers to receive ESPN programs on mobile devices, Iger told a conference sponsored by securities firm Sanford C. Bernstein. The service would be limited at the outset to subscribers of Comcast, who would be “authenticated” to access the family friendly channel through their TV subscriptions. The cable industry calls mobile services “TV Everywhere” and see them as key to keeping subscribers from dropping their service and opting instead for online programming. Iger said Disney is launching on Comcast first because the cable company secured expanded TV rights as part of an agreement in January to renew a 10-year contract to carry the Disney Channel, ESPN and other channels. WatchESPN was first offered by Time Warner Cable Inc, Iger said. In early May, Comcast began offering the sports service for mobile and online use to most of its 22 million TV subscribers, which increased the number of people with the capability to receive it to about 40 million. Iger said Disney also intended eventually to offer apps for some of its other TV properties, including its ABC network and ABC Family cable channel, but did not say when those would be available. The CEO of the largest U.S. entertainment conglomerate also criticized satellite operator Dish Networks Corp and its “Hopper” DVR. Iger said the new device, which allows viewers to skip TV commercials from network programs, “is harmful to the broadcast industry.” It “has a bit of the feeling of biting the hand that feeds you,” Iger told the investor conference. Dish introduced its Hopper DVR on May 10, which gives its subscribers the option to use “AutoHop” technology to record and watch network programs the following day, without advertising. Iger did not say whether Disney, ABC’s parent company, intended to join lawsuits filed by the parent companies of CBS, News Corp’s Fox and Comcast’s NBC to stop the service. The three contend in separate lawsuits that Hopper deprives networks of the means to fund programs that Dish transmits. Dish has counter sued, arguing that its customers pay for network programming through fees the satellite operator pays to the networks to carry them. Although he did not mention the lawsuit specifically, Iger said “he was confident in our position legally.” “You have to question what (the Dish ad-skipping service) does to the ability to invest in programming,” Iger added. “They don’t seem to care about that.” ",5302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney/disney-channel-to-go-mobile-soon-ceo-blasts-dish-idUSBRE84T12H20120530

324,DIS,Disney names Alan Horn to replace Rich Ross at movie studio,"LOS ANGELES, May 31 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co  named Alan Horn chairman of The Walt Disney Studios, replacing Rich Ross, who left the studio in late April following the poor performance of sci-fi adventure film “John Carter.” Horn resigned last year as president of Warner Brothers Entertainment, owned by rival Time Warner Inc, where he had oversight of its movie and home entertainment operation. Disney’s studio lost $84 million in its most recent quarter as a result of having to take a $200 million write-down for “John Carter,” one of the biggest box office busts in movie history. Two months after the failure of “John Carter,” Disney released “The Avengers,” which ranks as one of the biggest hits in box office history, so far grossing $1.3 billion in worldwide sales. It currently ranks as the fourth highest-grossing film ever, according to Box Office Mojo.",5312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-studio-alanhorn/disney-names-alan-horn-to-replace-rich-ross-at-movie-studio-idUSL1E8GVI2H20120531
325,DIS,New Disney studio chief's instructions: make good movies,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Alan Horn, the Walt Disney Co’s new studio chairman, won’t shy away from making big budget films despite Hollywood’s recent string of big budget bombs such as Disney’s “John Carter” and Universal Pictures’ “Battleship.” Horn, who spearheaded such expensive hits as the “Harry Potter” series while president of Warner Brothers Entertainment, intends to focus on six to eight films a year geared toward Disney’s core audience of families and young adults, he says, and was not told by Disney CEO Bob Iger to rein in budgets. “All Bob said was ‘make good movies,’” Horn, 69, told Reuters in a telephone interview. “I’ve made expensive films that have flopped, and boy do they hurt.” “But I’m screenplay driven, character driven,” he added. “If you start with a really great idea, the budget will resolve itself. And that budget could be substantial.” Horn follows Rich Ross, a former Disney Channel executive, who was pushed out for moving too slowly to put films into production and not watching the rising budget for “John Carter.” In 2009, long-time studio chief Dick Cook was fired after studio earnings fell 84 percent on the heels of big budget disappointments like “G-Force” and “Surrogates.” Disney’s big hits recently have come largely from its animation unit Pixar and its Marvel super hero factory, both of which make hugely expensive movies. But the payoff has been spectacular. Disney has so far generated more than $1.3 billion in worldwide ticket sales for Marvel’s “The Avengers,” already Hollywood’s fourth-largest film, according to Box Office Mojo. That film was made for more than $220 million. Disney has another “Avengers” movie in the works and next year will release the third “Iron Man” movie. The movies can also be “leveraged,” Iger often says. In June, Disney will open a ride at the Disney California Adventure theme park in Anaheim, based on Pixar’s blockbuster movie “Cars.” Iger told analysts that the company is planning rides at some of its theme parks based on Marvel characters. Horn’s job will be to work with creative executives at both Pixar and Marvel, which have both operated largely independently since Disney acquired them. “I take this as an opportunity to work with truly gifted people,” said Horn, who says he has yet to meet key executives at either unit. “My job is to be as constructive and collegial as I can.” Horn, who starts June 11, says his focus is to make films that appeal to what he calls “the Disney imprimatur” - “films that people have come to expect from Disney.” But Horn stresses that he doesn’t intend to make just G-rated movies. “I approved ‘Happy Feet,’ which appealed to the whole family,” he said. “I also approved ‘The Hangover.’” ",6012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-disney-studio-alanhorn/new-disney-studio-chiefs-instructions-make-good-movies-idUSBRE85004J20120601
326,DIS,"Exclusive: Disney to stop some junk-food ads on kids' TV, websites: sources","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co, owner of the ABC broadcast network and a suite of cable channels, will stop accepting some junk-food ads on TV programs, radio shows and websites aimed at children, according to sources with knowledge of the plan. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger and first lady Michelle Obama plan to make an announcement on Tuesday in Washington, the sources said. The United States faces an obesity epidemic. Nearly one-third of U.S. children are overweight or obese, and a 2006 Institute of Medicine report said junk food marketing contributed to childhood obesity. The Disney move follows New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s announcement last week of a plan to ban sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces (about half a liter) in most restaurants, theaters, delis and vending carts throughout the city. The ban, also aimed at fighting obesity, would affect drinks equivalent to what McDonald’s Corp calls small and has incensed food and beverage makers, many of which have agreed to voluntary nutritional measures. Disney plans to cut advertising during children’s programming on its networks such as ABC and Disney XD or its kid-focused websites for foods that fail to meet minimum nutrition requirements, the sources said. A Disney spokeswoman declined to comment on Tuesday’s announcement. The media and entertainment conglomerate introduced voluntary guidelines in 2006 that prohibited licensing of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters for foods that fail to meet minimum nutrition the requirements. The guidelines set limits on the amount of calories, fat and added sugar for main and side dishes and snacks. Last year, top U.S. food and drink makers including Kraft Foods, Coca-Cola and Kellogg Co agreed to voluntary nutrition criteria for products advertised to children.

327,DIS,Viacom blackout on DirecTV boosts Disney Channel,"(Reuters) - Kids and their parents shut out from watching Viacom Inc’s Nickelodeon on DirecTV appear to be turning to The Disney Channel, which is enjoying a ratings boost that could help the network even after a fee dispute ends. Ratings for Viacom-owned Nickelodeon fell 20 percent last week when two dozen Viacom networks came off the DirecTV satellite service a week ago due to a fight over programming fees, according to Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger. The loss for Nickelodeon benefited the Disney channel, which saw a 21 percent ratings jump for the same time period, Juenger said. “The Disney Channel has picked up all of Nick’s viewers and then some,” Juenger said in a research note. The Disney Channel averaged 356,000 viewers ages 2 to 5 each day from July 9 to 15, according to Nielsen data provided by Horizon Media. That compares with 271,000 for Nickelodeon. A Nickelodeon spokesman did not return a call for comment. Disney sent out a statement trumpeting the Disney Channel’s first No. 1 weekly ranking among preschoolers based on total day ratings. Programs such as “Doc McStuffins” and “Jake and the Never Land Pirates” lifted viewership among two- to five-year olds, the company said. Juenger, the Bernstein research analyst, said he believed the blackout was temporary but that children and their parents may get hooked on Disney’s programs in the meantime. Twenty-five Viacom-owned channels — including MTV, BET, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon — have been off air for DirecTV’s 20 million subscribers for nearly a week due to a programming fee contract dispute. DirecTV spokesman Robert Mercer said on Tuesday that “some customers have left us, but the numbers so far are very low.” DirecTV added the Disney Junior channel last week, a network targeting the lucrative market segment for 2-to-7-year-olds that competes with Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. DirecTV has also expanded a PBS children’s network called Sprout to more subscribers. Over the past few weeks, disputes over fees have erupted in the pay TV sector. DirecTV’s main rival, Dish Network, has dropped AMC Networks, while Time Warner Cable is in a dispute with Hearst Television. DirecTV shares 1.2 percent to $48.78 on Tuesday while Viacom shares lost a fraction of a cent to finish at $49.96.

329,DIS,"""Avengers"" helps power Disney profit in quarter","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) quarterly earnings rose 31 percent, exceeding Wall Street expectations, lifted by higher spending at theme parks and the blockbuster “The Avengers” superhero movie. The media and theme park company reported on Tuesday earnings per share of $1.01, beating the 93 cents a share that analysts had forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income rose 24 percent to $1.8 billion for the three months ended in June. Driven by “The Avengers,” which has made more than $1.4 billion worldwide, studio income increased to $313 million from $49 million a year earlier. Chief Executive Bob Iger announced the company had signed a deal with “Avengers” director Joss Whedon to write and direct an “Avengers” sequel, and to help develop a Marvel-based TV series for the ABC broadcast network. The studio results offset a decline in earnings at Disney’s powerhouse ESPN sports network, which the company said was due to the timing of deferred affiliate fees. Overall its cable TV unit, the company’s largest, increased by 1 percent to $1.86 billion. Advertising at ESPN grew in the quarter, helped by NBA games. Looking ahead, Iger said he was bullish about ESPN’s ad prospects “for the next number of months, maybe for the next year.” Advertising revenue at ABC “decreased modestly” from lower ratings partially offset by higher rates, Disney said. At theme parks, earnings rose 21 percent, the result of increases at its Tokyo theme park, where the company collects management and other fees, and which was impacted last year by a temporary suspension of operations following the March 2011 earthquake. Park results also improved due to a new cruise ship and more guests at Disneyland in California, where the company just completed a major expansion that includes “Cars Land.” Disney “showed great momentum across all their business lines,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Barton Crockett, who rates Disney a “buy.” “I thought it was a great quarter.” In after-hours trading, Disney’s shares declined 0.8 percent to $49.40, down from their earlier close of $49.81 on the New York Stock Exchange. Disney shares are near a lifetime high and the drop may have been due to profit-taking, Crockett said. “The stock had a very good improvement into the earnings report.” ",8072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-results/avengers-helps-power-disney-profit-in-quarter-idUSBRE8761AR20120807

332,DIS,Analysts raise Walt Disney price targets on strong profit,"(Reuters) - Several brokerages raised their price targets on Walt Disney Co’s stock after higher earnings from theme parks and the blockbuster “The Avengers” superhero movie boosted the company’s quarterly profit. The media and theme park company’s third-quarter net income rose 24 percent to $1.8 billion. Profit at Disney’s studio segment should last via sequels, Lazard Capital Markets analyst Barton Crockett wrote in a note. Driven by “The Avengers,” which has made more than $1.4 billion worldwide, studio income increased to $313 million from $49 million a year earlier. However, shares of the company were set to open 1.4 percent down on Wednesday. The stock, which touched a life-high of $50.54 last month, closed at $49.81 on Tuesday. Evercore analyst Alan Gould said the stock was down because the profit beat came from a film and is perceived by some to be a lower quality beat and that revenue missed expectations. Marvel’s “Avengers”, “Iron Man”, “Thor” and “Captain America” franchises combined with Pixar’s sequels such as “Monsters University” provide solid visibility over the next few years, RBC Capital Markets said in a note. The studio results offset a decline in earnings at Disney’s powerhouse ESPN sports network, which the company said was due to the timing of deferred affiliate fees.

The man, who was not immediately identified, was wearing scuba equipment to carry out maintenance at a deep pool on a ranch near Palmdale, in the desert north of Los Angeles, where “The Lone Ranger” is being shot, a spokesman at the Palmdale Sheriff’s station said. It was not immediately clear how the man died. “We regretfully confirm that a ‘Lone Ranger’ crew member has passed away after being taken to a local hospital. Our hearts and thoughts are with his family, friends, and colleagues at this time, and our full support is behind the investigation into the circumstances of this terrible event,” Walt Disney Co  studio spokesman Paul Roeder said in a statement. The man was thought to be preparing a tank for an underwater scene to be shot at a later date, a source close to the production said. There was no filming underway on the set when the incident occurred. The source did not want to be named because the investigation is ongoing. “The Lone Ranger”, a new spin on the classic Western adventure with Depp as Native American spirit warrior Tonto and Armie Hammer in the title role, is due to be released in July 2013.",9212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/film-loneranger-death/crew-diver-drowns-on-set-of-new-lone-ranger-movie-idUSL1E8KLJX320120921
335,DIS,Stan Lee Media sues Disney for billions over Marvel rights,"(Reuters) - Stan Lee Media, a company that says it controls the rights to Marvel characters including Spider Man and Iron Man, has filed suit in U.S. District Court in Colorado against the Walt Disney Co seeking “billions of dollars of profits.” Stan Lee, no longer associated with the company, created many of Marvel’s stable of comic book characters. The company claims Lee assigned it his rights to those characters in 1998 but then agreed a month later to assign the same rights to Marvel Enterprises. Disney acquired Marvel Enterprises, which had been renamed Marvel Entertainment, in 2009 for $4.3 billion. “The Walt Disney Company has represented to the public that it, in fact, owns the copyright to these characters as well as hundreds of other characters created by Stan Lee,” the suit alleges. “Those representations made to the public by the Walt Disney Company are false.” The lawsuit focuses on successful movies based on Marvel characters that Disney has released since its Marvel acquisition. Those films include “The Avengers,” which has grossed more than $1.5 billion in worldwide sales and is second only to “Avatar” and “Titanic,” according to movie site Box Office Mojo. “This lawsuit is without merit,” Walt Disney said in a statement. “It arises out of the same core facts and legal claims that have been rejected by three federal district court judges.” Stan Lee Media, which said it was created in 1999 to “sue to recover damages to its assets,” has been involved in what it called a “somewhat tortured history” of litigation dating from 2001 over corporate governance issues and the characters rights in cases filed in Colorado, New York and California. They include suits between the company, its shareholders and Lee. The latest suit claims that Stan Lee Media owns the rights “to the billions of dollars that Disney has generated, or allowed others to generate”. It cites more than $3.5 billion from motion pictures, and what it calculates is more than $2 billion from “other media,” merchandising and the Broadway show “Spiderman: Turn off the Dark.” ",10112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-stanleemedia-waltdisney/stan-lee-media-sues-disney-for-billions-over-marvel-rights-idUSBRE89A0CC20121011

337,DIS,"Disney to buy ""Star Wars"" producer for $4.05 billion","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co agreed to buy filmmaker George Lucas’s Lucasfilm Ltd and its “Star Wars” franchise for $4.05 billion in cash and stock, a blockbuster deal that includes the surprise promise of a new film in the series in 2015. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts on Tuesday that the plan is to release a new movie in the series every two to three years thereafter. The last “Star Wars” picture was “Revenge of the Sith” in 2005, and Lucas has in the past denied any plans for more. Lucas, a Hollywood icon known for exercising control over the most minute details of the fictional universe he created, will remain as a creative consultant on the new films. “It’s now time for me to pass ‘Star Wars’ on to a new generation of filmmakers,” he said in a statement. Lucas will become the second-largest individual holder of Disney shares, with a 2.2 percent stake. Disney will pay about half the purchase price in cash and issue about 40 million shares at closing. “This is one of the greatest entertainment properties of all time,” Iger said. Like Disney’s purchases of Marvel Entertainment and Pixar studio, LucasFilm will “drive long-term value to our shareholders,” he said. Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said the deal would lower Disney’s earnings per share by a low single-digits percentage in fiscal 2013 and 2014. He also said Disney would repurchase all of the issued shares on the open market within the next two years, on top of planned buybacks. This agreement marks the third time in less than seven years that Disney has signed a massive deal to take over a beloved studio or character portfolio, part of its strategy to acquire brands that can be stretched across TV, movies, theme parks and the Internet. In early 2006, Disney struck a deal to acquire “Toy Story” creator Pixar, and in the summer of 2009 it bought the comic book powerhouse Marvel. “Disney already has a great portfolio and this adds one more,” said Morningstar analyst Michael Corty. “They don’t have any holes, but their past deals have been additive.” Iger said he and Lucas first discussed a possible sale about 18 months ago. Lucas was pondering his retirement, and Iger was looking to add another well-known brand to the Disney empire. The two signed the deal at Disney’s Burbank, California, headquarters on Tuesday. “Everywhere I went, ‘Star Wars’ was already there, and sometimes they got there ahead of us,” said Iger in an interview. “I kept seeing that brand and decided maybe we should buy it.” He told analysts he believed there was “substantial pent-up demand” for new “Star Wars” movies. Each of the last three films in the series would have grossed $1.5 billion in today’s dollars at the box office, CFO Rasulo estimated. The film’s iconic characters also will boost Disney’s sales of toys and other consumer products, particularly overseas, executives said. Sales of “Star Wars” items such as Darth Vader and Yoda action figures total roughly $215 million a year, Rasulo said. In 2005, the year the last “Star Wars” film was released, LucasFilm generated $550 million in operating income, Rasulo said. Disney also will be able to extend the presence of the franchise at its theme parks around the globe, Iger said. The company’s parks already feature rides based on “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones,” another Lucas property. “Star Wars” characters also are likely to find a home on the Disney XD cable channel, which is aimed at young boys, Iger said. Iger wouldn’t commit to keeping the “Star Wars” operation separate from Disney, as he did with Pixar and Marvel. And Lucas won’t sit on the Disney board despite his 2.2 percent stake in the company, Iger said. The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who held a large stake in Disney after it bought his Pixar studio, had a seat on the Disney board. From a fan’s perspective, critics said there was sure to be at least some excitement at the prospect of episode seven in the saga of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. “Do I want to see more Star Wars movies? Not really, but they’re not making these movies for me,” the film writer “Mr. Beaks” wrote on the well-regarded industry site Ain’t It Cool News. “There’s a whole new generation of Star Wars fans, and they worship the prequels like folks my age worshipped the original trilogy.” Besides “Star Wars,” the Lucasfilm deal also includes rights to the “Indiana Jones” franchise, though Disney did not elaborate on any plans for that series.

Sales of “Star Wars” items such as Darth Vader and Yoda action figures total roughly $215 million a year, Rasulo said. In 2005, the year the last “Star Wars” film was released, LucasFilm generated $550 million in operating income, he added. Lucas will not sit on the Disney board despite his 2.2 percent stake in the company, Iger said. Jobs, who held a large stake in Disney after it bought Pixar, had a seat on Disney’s board. Earlier this year, Lucas had told the fan magazine Empire: “I’m moving away from the company, I’m moving away from all my businesses, I’m finishing all my obligations and I’m going to retire to my garage with my saw and hammer and build hobby movies. “I’ve always wanted to make movies that were more experimental in nature, and not have to worry about them showing in movie theaters.”",10312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-lucas/update-6-disney-to-buy-star-wars-producer-for-4-05-bln-idUSL3E8LU5CM20121031
343,DIS,"New ""Star Wars"" movies - dream come true, or cosmic yawn?","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - For years, it seemed like another “Star Wars” movie was just a dream, stillborn in a galaxy far, far away. But down on Earth, the Walt Disney movie studio had different ideas, announcing on Tuesday that it planned not one but at least three new “Star Wars” movies, starting in three years’ time. Disney’s $4 billion acquisition of George Lucas’ Lucasfilm and the multibillion-dollar “Star Wars” franchise surprised investors and caused mixed reactions among movie fans, many of whom had little appetite for more Luke Skywalkers and Jedis. “The series had stagnated creatively. This could go well...Or not,” said Facebook user Chris Goodson. Another user, Peter Campbell, voiced his disbelief, asking, “Is this for real? Oh please, enough with the Star Wars movies.” Lucas, whose imagination gave pop culture Princess Leia and her crazy cinnamon-bun hairstyle, the anti-hero Darth Vader and the catch phrase “May The Force Be With You,” has insisted for years that he would make no more than the three original films and three prequels. Lucas has often expressed frustration with criticism from many avid “Star Wars” fans who have taken issue with his director’s cuts of the films. “Why would I make any more,” Lucas told the New York Times in a January interview about the “Star Wars” movies, “when everybody yells at you all the time and says what a terrible person you are?” But seven years after the last picture, “Revenge of the Sith,” Disney said on Tuesday it saw room for “Star Wars Episode 7” in 2015, with Episodes 8 and 9 to follow at two or three year intervals. Some fans welcomed the prospect of new films. On the Facebook “Star Wars” page, user David Schmoyer said “it brings dreaming back to the place where many of us began to dream.” Others were less happy. User Andreas Pedersen called it “the worst April Fools’ joke ever,” while another fan, Brandan Sullivan, said “this might be the death of Star Wars.” “People don’t seem to be recognizing that taking Star Wars out of George Lucas’ hands is the best possible thing for the franchise,” Jesse Taylor counter-argued on Twitter. HAN SOLO, R2-D2, MICKEY AND MINNIE In addition to new films, characters like Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi may find a home on the Disney XD cable TV channel, targeted at young boys. Furthermore, Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger told reporters on a conference call that there was “ample opportunity” to extend the franchise in Disney’s global theme parks, cementing the place of R2-D2 and Han Solo alongside Mickey Mouse and the Little Mermaid. “Cool for another Star Wars but not sure I like Disney backing it,” commented Janel Halstead on Facebook. The “Star Wars” franchise has earned some $4.4 billion at the global box office since the first film was released in 1977, making it the third most successful movie property after “Harry Potter” and the “James Bond” series. Like the boy wizard and the suave British secret agent, “Star Wars” has also spawned an empire of books, games and toys so large that it is often dubbed the “Expanded Universe.” It has also inspired a mini-industry dedicated to examining philosophical, spiritual and mythical themes, with many observers seeing Luke Skywalker as an embodiment of Jesus Christ and some seeing Yoda as inspired by a Mormon prophet. Lucas, 68, said in a video posted on the StarWars.com website on Tuesday that he had story treatments for Episodes 7, 8 and 9 that he would hand over to producer Kathleen Kennedy to develop in partnership with Disney. In the same video, Kennedy said Disney was the “best company possible to take Star Wars into the future,” and assured Lucas that she would adhere to his creations. “The main thing is to protect these characters to make sure they continue to live in the way you created them,” Kennedy said.

345,DIS,Disney's $4 billion Lucasfilm deal began with lightsabers in Orlando,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s $4 billion deal to buy George Lucas’s Lucasfilm Ltd, Disney’s third major entertainment acquisition in seven years, started taking shape in May 2011, when the “Star Wars” creator had to show Disney CEO Bob Iger how to use a lightsaber. Lucas and Iger were at Disney’s Hollywood Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida, brandishing the toys at the grand opening of a 3-D version of the park’s Star Tours ride, Iger recalls, and “George had to show me how to use it.” Talks heated up this summer when the 68-year-old Lucas recently decided he wanted to retire from running a business to focus on smaller, more personal film projects. Iger was excited about the prospect of adding marquee properties like Star Wars and Indiana Jones to the stable of brand names he’s now spent $15 billion to acquire since becoming CEO in 2005. “We proved with our Pixar and Marvel acquisitions that we know how to expand the value of a brand,” Iger said in an interview. “And brands don’t get much bigger than Star Wars.” Lucas is expected to serve as a consultant while Disney revs the producer’s entertainment company, which generated $550 million in operating earnings in 2005 when Lucasfilms made the last installment of his franchise, “Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith”. Lucas, in a video interview released at StarWars.com, said: “I really wanted to put the company somewhere in a larger entity which could protect it. Disney is a huge corporation. They have all kinds of capabilities and facilities, so that there’s a lot of strength that is gained by this.” Kathleen Kennedy, co-chairman of Lucasfilm, is expected to play a major role in the Star Wars franchise, and Lucasfilm said it would retain operations in Northern California. Disney intends to make a new Star Wars film every two or three years, Iger said. The company will also use the iconic brand to build theme park rides, produce TV shows and sell Darth Vader action figures. “This is remarkably attractive for Disney,” said Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities. “I almost feel like Lucas really wanted it to be with Walt Disney and almost gave them a sweetheart deal.” Iger’s big ticket acquisitions haven’t always gotten such rave reviews. When Disney bought Steve Jobs’ Pixar animation studio for $7.5 billion in stock in 2006, some analysts said at the time that the company overpaid for the producer of “Toy Story” and “Finding Nemo”. Disney has since bought back the stock it issued for that deal, as it did after spending $4.2 billion in stock and cash to buy comic book and action film maker Marvel in 2010, said Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo. Both of those transactions have paid dividends: Marvel produced “The Avengers” earlier this year, which had worldwide ticket sales of $1.5 billion. Pixar produced two “Cars” movies, which sold $1 billion in tickets worldwide, and helped Disney design the Cars Land section of its California Adventure theme park in Anaheim. “I think we made believers of those who supported us back then,” said Iger, “and maybe turned some of our critics into believers.” When Disney produces the first of the new “Star Wars” movies in 2015, “Star Wars” and a film based on a Marvel character will account for as much as half the studio’s action film slate, Iger said in a conference call. Pixar, with its almost-unblemished record of success at the box office, will continue to make another film each year. “I’m not looking over my shoulder with any of those acquisitions,” said Iger. “In football, there’s a term for when a receiver catches the ball and gets hit. It’s called ‘hearing footsteps’.” With the Lucasfilms deal, the Disney executive said: “I’m not hearing any footsteps.” ",10312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-lucas-iger/disneys-4-billion-lucasfilm-deal-began-with-lightsabers-in-orlando-idUSBRE89U03620121031

348,DIS,Renowned special effects firm is 'Star Wars' bonus for Disney,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 5 (Reuters) - “Star Wars” was the force behind Walt Disney’s $4 billion purchase of producer George Lucas’s Lucasfilm entertainment holdings. Not so far, far away is Lucas’ Industrial Light and Magic, his award-winning special effects shop that will likely save Disney millions of dollars in costs for its big-budget movies. ILM, started by Lucas in 1975 when he couldn’t find a special effects house he liked for “Star Wars,” has provided computer-generated dinosaurs, space ships and action characters for a roster of films that includes “Avatar,” “Mission Impossible” and the “Harry Potter” series. As much as one-third of the cost of films with budgets of $200 million and more are for special effects, according to Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible, who estimates ILM last year generated at least $100 million in revenue. Disney uses ILM’s computer animators for its “Pirates of the Caribbean” series of films and Marvel-inspired characters for films like “The Avengers.” ILM is among the companies producing special effects for the Disney film “The Lone Ranger,” a 2013 release estimated to cost more than $200 million to produce. By bringing ILM in-house, Disney can shave as much as $20 million a year from its films’ special effects budgets, a welcome savings at a time when all major studios are trying to rein in production spending, Wible said. “It’s one of the underappreciated aspects of this deal,” he said, along with Skywalker Sound, a Lucas sound production company that will also become part of the Disney empire. Disney executives, in a conference call with Wall Street analysts, scarcely mentioned ILM in explaining the company’s  valuation of Lucasfilm, instead describing its estimate of the company’s rights to its consumer products and the declining value of DVD sales. Chief Executive Bob Iger praised ILM’s work for Disney and other studios. “Our current thinking is that we would let it remain as-is. They do great work,” Iger said. A Disney spokesman said the company could not comment further about ILM or the rest of the acquisition until it is cleared by regulators. The effects house is headquartered in San Francisco at the Letterman Digital Arts Center, a Lucasfilm campus where a statue of Yoda perches atop an outdoor fountain. The effects company employs about 1,000 people between that location and sites in Singapore and Vancouver. The studio provides effects for as many as 18 projects per year, working with all the major Hollywood studios that compete with Disney. That outside work beyond “Star Wars” will give Disney another revenue source from ILM. “We can handle quite a slate of films,” Lucasfilm spokesman Miles Perkins said of ILM. “We look forward to continuing that.” ILM also generates money by supplying effects for commercials by big-name brands Coca-Cola, Budweiser and others. For Disney’s Iger, who prides his company as being among Hollywood’s most forward thinking on new technology, the Lucasfilm buy might also provide another front for the media giant. Its computer-wielding artists could work with Disney’s Imagineering unit, which creates many of the technologies the company uses at its theme parks. Lucasfilm engineers created THX, which was designed to help theaters create the best sound for movies through a system that the Lucas company certifies meets its technical standards. T HX, which was spun off from Lucasfilms in 2001, also certifies home entertainment systems, consumer electronic products and automobile sound systems. Hollywood studios have a generally poor record owning effects companies, said Scott Ross, a former general manager of ILM and one of the founders of effects company Digital Domain. Disney bought Dream Quest Images in 1996 and shuttered it five years later. Warner Bros. also has shut or sold off effects companies it acquired. Only Sony Corp has found success with its Imageworks effects unit. Studios usually discover that running an effects business is costly and foreign competitors can do the job cheaper, Ross said. “They come to the conclusion that running a visual effects company is not a profitable business,” Ross said. Iger, in announcing the deal to Wall Street analysts, praised ILM’s work and said he had no immediate plans to change it. “It’s been a decent business for Lucasfilm and one we have every intention of staying in,” he said.

354,DIS,"Disney profit meets expectations, lifted by parks, ESPN","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Media giant Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) posted higher quarterly profit on Thursday, lifted by an increase in visitors to its theme parks and revenue gains at sports juggernaut ESPN. The company that recently announced a blockbuster deal to buy “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm reported diluted earnings per share of 68 cents. That matched expectations from Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income for the quarter that ended in September rose 14 percent to $1.2 billion. Looking ahead, Disney faces challenges that will pressure results for its fiscal first quarter from October to December, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo told analysts on a conference call. Among them, sports rights’ costs will increase by $170 million while home video sales decline by $150 million in light of tough comparisons to “Cars 2” a year earlier, he said. Those issues will not hurt full-year earnings for fiscal 2013, Rasulo said. “I’m confident we will have solid earnings growth for the rest of the year,” he said. CEO Bob Iger said Disney was entering a “transition year” after making investments in projects such as the “Cars Land” expansion at Disneyland Resort in California and a new cruise ship that launched this year. The company is moving from “investment mode” into “a more compelling growth mode,” he said. Disney plans to stimulate its growth through its $4 billion acquisition of Lucasfilm, announced on October 30, and plans for three new “Star Wars” films starting in 2015. Results for the just-ended quarter were driven by the media networks unit that houses ESPN, the Disney Channels and ABC. The division posted operating income of $1.6 billion, a 7 percent gain from a year earlier. ESPN brought in higher rates from cable operators and reduced its marketing costs although advertising income fell, Disney said. Increased programming costs at online video service Hulu dragged on results for the ABC broadcasting unit, Rasulo said. The quarter was “slightly negative” for ABC and would have ended “slightly higher” without Hulu, he said. The theme parks division gained from passengers spending more time on Disney cruise ships plus higher attendance at parks in Hong Kong, California and Paris, the company said. Operating income climbed 18 percent to $497 million during the quarter. Operating income at Disney’s film studio fell 32 percent, in part because the box office performance of animated film “Brave” did not match the previous year’s release of “Cars 2.” Disney shares dropped 2 percent in after-hours trading to $49. Earlier, shares closed at $50.04, down 4 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. They are up 33 percent this year. Morningstar analyst Michael Corty said Disney produced “another solid quarter” particularly with its cable networks business, though he noted that revenue was below what some analysts expected. Overall revenue rose 3 percent in the quarter to $10.8 billion. “Disney has so many good things going for it that any weakness in the stock would be a buying opportunity,” he said.

356,DIS,Former Disney CEO Eisner back in moviemaking with Universal,"(Reuters) - Former Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Michael Eisner has struck a distribution deal with Universal Pictures, a likely prelude to the media mogul raising money to fund film development. Terms of the multi-year deal call for Universal, owned by cable giant Comcast Corp, to market and distribute movies developed and financed by Eisner under the auspices of his privately owned media holding company Tornante Co, Eisner said. In a phone interview with Reuters from Los Angeles, Eisner was cagey about precisely how he planned to finance the movies. Rumors began circulating first in Variety in January and then on CNBC in May about Eisner trying to raise an $800 million film fund, broken out into $400 million of equity and $400 million of debt. Eisner declined to give specific details on any fundraising efforts that may be taking place. Eisner said he will be investing his own money into development and plans to bring partners into the venture. He said JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley, Blackstone Group LP and Moelis & Co were working with him on behalf of the venture. “Obviously, I wouldn’t be making a distribution deal if I wasn’t confident that the films would be financed,” he said. Despite having spent more than two decades at the helm of Disney, Eisner said he did not have any discussions with the company regarding this deal and described Universal as a “natural fit.” “I made about 400 movies with Disney and I figured that was enough,” joked Eisner. “I thought I’d try my hand working for another organization.” Eisner is no stranger to Universal’s parent company, Comcast. Steve Burke, CEO of Comcast-owned NBC Universal, ran Disney’s theme parks under Eisner. And Burke was one of the main champions behind Comcast’s failed $49 billion hostile takeover bid for Disney in 2004. “Michael Eisner has been a powerful creative force behind some of the world’s greatest films and we’re confident that with Tornante, he’ll continue that tradition,” Universal Pictures Chairman Adam Fogelson and Co-Chairman Donna Langley said in a joint statement. Eisner, 70, said he hopes to have the first film under the deal in theaters by the end of next year or early in 2014. He declined to comment on the number of movies expected to be released annually, saying only that the plan was to develop “a significant number of films over the whole period” of the agreement. In terms of production budgets, Eisner said they will vary depending on the movie but that the venture was unlikely to make any “incredibly expensive, bet-the-house” investments on any one film. Without being precise, he said he would aim for budgets in line with his track record while at Disney and, before that, Paramount Pictures, which he said consistently averaged about 20 percent below the industry norm. “I never did a $200 million or $250 million movie, that’s not my kind of thing,” Eisner said. After leaving Disney in 2005, Eisner launched Tornante Co, which has produced shows for the Internet and television but has until now shied away from motion picture production. Through Tornante, Eisner founded digital production studio Vuguru and owns sports trading card company Topps in partnership with private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners. Among the projects produced by Vuguru are the animated series “Glenn Martin DDS” on Nickelodeon, “The Booth at the End” on Hulu, and “Little Women, BIG CARS” on AOL. While the aim of the Universal deal is to produce new original content, Eisner said movies could grow out of existing Tornante projects. Still undecided is whether Tornante will control the new venture or if it will operate under another name and simply be housed under the Tornante umbrella. The latter structure could mean that Eisner would be eligible to collect producer fees from Tornante for films he develops - in essence, getting paid by his own company. Eisner declined to comment on the potential of collecting producer fees, saying only that the venture’s financial structure is still being worked out. “My goal is to have a good time and make films. Hopefully, it will be a success and out of that success will be some financial rewards,” he said.

357,DIS,REFILE-ESPN strikes deal for new U.S. college football playoffs,"* Source says ESPN paying more than $7 billion for games * New playoff deal will start in 2014, secured for 12 years * College football approved new playoff format in the summer * Adds to ESPN’s portfolio of high-profile live sports By Liana B. Baker Nov 21 (Reuters) - Disney’s ESPN said on Wednesday it locked up the TV rights for U.S. college football playoff games for 12 years in a new deal that a source said was worth more than $7 billion. ESPN did not disclose financial terms of the agreement with the group that will administer the new college football playoff system, which starts in 2014. The deal will run from 2014 until January 2026, the network said in a statement. A source with knowledge of the matter said ESPN would pay $470 million a year, or $5.64 billion over 12 years to carry the games that are part of the new playoff format that was approved in June by a committee of university presidents. Combined with a previous agreement for three bowl games, the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl and Fiesta Bowl, ESPN will pay between $600 million and $615 million per year, or between $7.2 billion and $7.38 billion, for the postseason games. ESPN will have the rights to air a championship game and a pair of semifinal games featuring teams that are selected for the four-game playoff. It will also air other bowl games that will rotate each year. The games will be featured on ESPN’s platforms, including television, radio and on the Internet and mobile devices. The highly profitable ESPN TV network is a major revenue generator for Disney. It is seen in 98 million homes and has secured major multi-year sports TV deals with the NFL, Major League Baseball, Wimbledon and college football, among others. In August, ESPN agreed to pay Major League Baseball $5.6 billion over eight years for a package of baseball games. Sporting events are among the shrinking number of broadcasts that viewers watch live without skipping commercials, and therefore reap some of the highest rates from advertisers. This has drawn more bidders to sports programming, driving prices higher and providing a boon to sports teams.

364,DIS,Netflix to get Disney films in TV distribution deal,"(Reuters) - Netflix will provide TV viewers with live and animated Disney, Pixar, Marvel Comics and Lucasfilm movies starting in 2016, as Walt Disney Co on Tuesday became the first major studio to choose Netflix over cable TV networks. Netflix shares jumped 14 percent on the news, as investors saw the Disney deal as an important endorsement of the DVD rental and streaming service, which has struggled with slowing subscriber growth and higher costs for content distribution. Liberty Media Corp, whose Starz group now distributes Disney movies on TV, fell almost 5 percent. “An exclusive deal with Disney differentiates the Netflix content from Hulu Plus and Amazon Instant Video,” said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Barclays Capital. But some analysts worried that Netflix paid too much to get Disney’s movies. Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, estimated in a report that Netflix paid more than $350 million a year for Disney’s movies and said “we would not be surprised if would need to raise capital.” By comparison, HBO agreed to pay an estimated $200 million annually in its so-called “output,” or movie licensing deal, with 20th Century Fox earlier this year, according to the Los Angeles Times. Disney movies will be available for streaming on Netflix beginning in 2016, after its current deal with Liberty Media’s pay-TV channel Starz expires. The deal is for both new movies from Disney’s studios and library content such as “Dumbo” and “Alice in Wonderland.” The deal gives Netflix streaming rights to movies from Disney’s live-action and animation studios, including those from Pixar, Marvel, and the recently acquired Lucasfilm. On October 30, Disney announced a $4 billion deal to purchase the famed studio founded by George Lucas, which will now make new episodes in the blockbuster “Star Wars” series that Lucas created. “This deal brings to our subscribers some of the highest quality, most imaginative family films being made today,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, in a statement. “It’s a leap forward for Internet television.” Movies from Steven Spielberg’s DreamWorks Studios are not included in the deal, as that studio distributes its movies through CBS’s Showtime on TV. Disney recently signed a deal to distribute DreamWorks’ films theatrically after the studio’s deal with Viacom’s Paramount Pictures expired. The deal allows Netflix to stream Disney movies beginning seven to nine months after they appear in theaters, as Starz does now under Disney’s prior agreement. The deal does not cover DVD rentals of Disney movies. Disney said in November that it would shut down its own video streaming service, Disney Movies Online, which had failed to catch on with users. A message on the ‘Disney Movies Online’ website said it would shut down on December 31. Netflix, which started its streaming business with mostly older films, has been moving to add more original programming and produces TV shows such as “Lilyhammer,” which stars “Sopranos” actor Steven Van Zandt as an American gangster who starts a new life in Norway. The company also struck a high-profile deal with actor Kevin Spacey for “House of Cards.” The Disney pact follows similar deals Netflix has inked for new films with smaller studios, including Relativity Media, The Weinstein company and DreamWorks Animation. The agreements have saddled Netflix with nearly $5 billion in contractual commitments over the next three years for deals its made for streaming content, the company said in its most recent quarterly earnings report. Netflix’s struggles over the last year, which have included missed subscriber guidance, an ill-fated attempt to split the DVD and streaming operations, and a swooning stock price, recently attracted the attention of billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn. Icahn disclosed in regulatory filings on October 31 that he had amassed a nearly 10 percent stake in the video company and suggested it should pursue a sale. Netflix responded by adopting a poison pill defense. Losing Disney’s movies means Starz is left with only Sony Pictures for film content. The pay-TV channel cast the ending of its agreement with Disney as its decision, saying it preferred to use the money for original programming creation. In a statement, Starz said it now has an “opportunity to implement our plan to dramatically ramp up our investment in exclusive, premium-quality original series which will best meet the needs of our distributors and subscribers.” Netflix shares jumped $10.6491, or 14 percent, to $86.6491.

369,DIS,Netflix says it won't raise prices after Disney deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Netflix Inc doesn’t plan to pass along the cost of the rights to Walt Disney Co movies to subscribers, a senior executive at the video streaming company said on Wednesday. Netflix, which analysts estimate paid more than $350 million for the exclusive rights to stream Disney movies to TV beginning in 2016, is not considering a price increase to help finance the deal, said Ted Sarandos, the company’s chief content officer, at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference. “We are not contemplating” raising the $8-a-month subscription fee for unlimited online viewing, Sarandos said during an interview with filmmaker Harvey Weinstein. The deal gives Netflix streaming rights to movies from Disney’s live-action and animation studios, including those from Pixar, Marvel, and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm. Netflix suffered from a consumer backlash and stock plunge after it announced an unpopular price increase in July 2011. But Netflix’s rising content costs have raised worries on Wall Street, with some analysts concerned that Netflix paid too much to get Disney’s movies. Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, estimated in a report that Netflix paid more than $350 million a year to secure the deal. Sarandos called the arrangement with Disney a “game changer” that for the first time will bring new movies from a major Hollywood studio to an Internet-streaming service rather than a cable channel such as HBO or Showtime. Calling Disney a “near-perfect” media company, he said the two began discussing a deal before Disney acquired Lucasfilm and announced plans for new “Star Wars” movies. Disney talked with other outlets before deciding Netflix was the best platform for its first-run movies, Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said. “This was the highest value deal for us to do. We are thrilled to do it with them,” Rasulo said, also speaking at the UBS conference. Sarandos said Disney’s movies will bolster one of Netflix’s most popular types of content - animated children’s movies. Netflix had a previous deal to stream Disney movies through an agreement with Liberty Media’s Starz network, which currently holds the exclusive rights to distribute new Disney films on TV. “When we looked at the data of when we used to have Starz, the ones that constantly performed for us were those big animated features, lots of repeat viewing,” Sarandos said. “It’s a nice, safe brand halo when you put your kid in front of an iPad.” In January, Netflix executives played down the importance of Disney movies to its service. At that time, 15 Disney titles including “Toy Story 3” and “Tangled” accounted for about 2 percent of U.S. viewing on the Netflix streaming service, the company said in a quarterly letter to investors. On Wednesday, Sarandos said Netflix would like to bring more, fresher content from other studios to its service. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said he thought investors’ positive reaction to the Disney deal was unwarranted given the price Netflix likely paid. “Ultimately, we think that deals such as the Disney deal could spell doom for Netflix,” said Pachter, who rates Netflix “underperform.” “Perhaps most importantly, a long-term and expensive content deal makes Netflix less attractive to potential acquirers,” Pachter said in a research note. The agreement received applause from Weinstein, who called it “probably the biggest content deal in the history of our business.” He joked he had used Netflix as a “babysitter” at times with his two-and-a-half-year-old child. “Moving into the family area is a very smart play in terms of you almost cornering the market,” Weinstein said. Netflix already had deals to stream movies with smaller studios including Weinstein’s studio, The Weinstein Co, as well as Dreamworks Animation and Relativity Media. Sarandos said he had not heard any response to the deal from Carl Icahn, the activist investor who recently purchased a nearly 10 percent stake in the company. Netflix adopted a poison pill defense to prevent a takeover. “This relationship is pretty new,” Sarandos said of Icahn. But he said Icahn has been “publicly and privately very supportive” of Netflix. Netflix shares, which rose 14 percent when the Disney deal was unveiled on Tuesday, gained 1.7 percent at $85.15 in Wednesday afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Disney shares were up 1 percent at $49.81 on the New York Stock Exchange.

370,DIS,Disney CFO: ESPN ad sales slightly ahead of last year,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Advertising sales at Walt Disney Co’s sports powerhouse ESPN are running slightly ahead of the level they reached at the same point last year, Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on Wednesday. At the ESPN cable television network, “we have now seen a slight improvement” in the pace of ad sales compared with a year ago, Rasulo said at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference. The assessment for the cable network, a key driver of Disney results, was rosier than the one Rasulo gave when the company released quarterly earnings on November 8. At that time, Rasulo said quarter-to-date ESPN ad sales were “pacing down modestly.” Rasulo declined to comment on ad sales at ABC, which like other broadcast networks has suffered from a ratings decline this fall. Among the broadcasters, only Comcast Corp’s NBC has seen primetime viewership increase compared with last year. ABC took a big ratings hit with the network’s decision to have past top-rated contestants on “Dancing with the Stars” face off in an all-star competition, Rasulo said. “It didn’t work out,” Rasulo said, perhaps because “people didn’t want to see people they knew could dance, they wanted to see people who couldn’t dance. “It’s not easy to be a taste-master in programming a network,” he said.

371,DIS,Starz could benefit from skipping Disney deal: analysts,"(Reuters) - Passing on a pricy Disney distribution deal could help premium movie channel Starz become a more attractive acquisition target for media companies when Liberty Media spins it off in late December or January, analysts say. Netflix said on Tuesday it signed a deal with Disney that gives it exclusive rights to stream Disney movies beginning in 2016, a pact analysts estimated to be worth more than $350 million. Starz currently has an agreement with Disney for the rights to stream movies 7 to 9 months after they come out in theaters. That deal expires in 2016. Shares in Starz’ owner, Liberty Media, fell about 5 percent on Tuesday, on concerns it will have a programming shortage. On Wednesday, the shares were up 98 cents, by 0.92 percent at $106.51. Liberty announced in August that Starz, which runs eponymous movie and TV channels as well as Encore-branded movie channels, will become a separate listed company with about $1.5 billion of debt. The spinoff is expected in late December or early January, according to Macquarie analyst Amy Yong. “By not entering into another partnership, we believe this increases Starz’ flexibility in the event of M&A;,” she said in a research note. Starz ended the third quarter with 20.8 million Starz subscribers and 34.3 Encore subscribers. Starz becomes more attractive to a potential buyers such as Comcast and News Corp, neither of which has a premium movie cable channel, Yong said. She added that these media companies could potentially negotiate better movie deals for Starz or have their own movies to feature on Starz. The Wall Street Journal, citing an unidentified source, reported on Wednesday that Starz will begin discussions with potential buyers once it is spun off in early January. Liberty did not respond immediately to a request for comment on a Starz sale. In September, Liberty Chief Executive Greg Maffei said the company was “a long way down the road from somebody approaching us” to buy Starz. In October, Liberty Chairman John Malone said that once it is spun out, Starz could have synergies with media companies and said that “everybody could use a big brother.” ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said in a research note on Tuesday that Malone’s “big brother” comments imply that a potential sale may “be sooner rather than later.” He said skipping a new deal with Disney could have saved Starz up to $400 million. To be sure, Starz could face a programming dearth starting in 2016 when it does not have Disney content, which makes up half of its schedule, according to Janney analyst Tony Wible. “The deal leaves Starz with very few options,” he said. Starz has been airing original programming such as “Spartacus,” a drama set in ancient Rome, and mob drama “Magic City” set in Miami in 1959. Wible said these original shows will not be able to make up for the loss of Disney movies, which could “impact the spin-off value” of Starz.

Netflix said on Tuesday it signed a deal with Disney that gives it exclusive rights to stream Disney movies beginning in 2016, a pact analysts estimated to be worth more than $350 million. Starz currently has an agreement with Disney for the rights to stream movies 7 to 9 months after they come out in theaters. That deal expires in 2016.

373,DIS,UPDATE 1-Netflix says it won't raise prices after Disney deal,"By Lisa Richwine NEW YORK, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc doesn’t plan to pass along the cost of the rights to Walt Disney Co  movies to subscribers, a senior executive at the video streaming company said on Wednesday. Netflix, which analysts estimate paid more than $350 million for the exclusive rights to stream Disney movies to TV beginning in 2016, is not considering a price increase to help finance the deal, said Ted Sarandos, the company’s chief content officer, at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference. “We are not contemplating” raising the $8-a-month subscription fee for unlimited online viewing, Sarandos said during an interview with filmmaker Harvey Weinstein. The deal gives Netflix streaming rights to movies from Disney’s live-action and animation studios, including those from Pixar, Marvel, and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm. Netflix suffered from a consumer backlash and stock plunge after it announced an unpopular price increase in July 2011. But Netflix’s rising content costs have raised worries on Wall Street, with some analysts concerned that Netflix paid too much to get Disney’s movies. Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, estimated in a report that Netflix paid more than $350 million a year to secure the deal. Sarandos called the arrangement with Disney a “game changer” that for the first time will bring new movies from a major Hollywood studio to an Internet-streaming service rather than a cable channel such as HBO or Showtime. Calling Disney a “near-perfect” media company, he said the two began discussing a deal before Disney acquired Lucasfilm and announced plans for new “Star Wars” movies. Disney talked with other outlets before deciding Netflix was the best platform for its first-run movies, Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said. “This was the highest value deal for us to do. We are thrilled to do it with them,” Rasulo said, also speaking at the UBS conference. Sarandos said Disney’s movies will bolster one of Netflix’s most popular types of content - animated children’s movies. Netflix had a previous deal to stream Disney movies through an agreement with Liberty Media’s Starz network, which currently holds the exclusive rights to distribute new Disney films on TV. “When we looked at the data of when we used to have Starz, the ones that constantly performed for us were those big animated features, lots of repeat viewing,” Sarandos said. “It’s a nice, safe brand halo when you put your kid in front of an iPad.” In January, Netflix executives played down the importance of Disney movies to its service. At that time, 15 Disney titles including “Toy Story 3” and “Tangled” accounted for about 2 percent of U.S. viewing on the Netflix streaming service, the company said in a quarterly letter to investors. On Wednesday, Sarandos said Netflix would like to bring more, fresher content from other studios to its service. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said he thought investors’ positive reaction to the Disney deal was unwarranted given the price Netflix likely paid. “Ultimately, we think that deals such as the Disney deal could spell doom for Netflix,” said Pachter, who rates Netflix “underperform.” “Perhaps most importantly, a long-term and expensive content deal makes Netflix less attractive to potential acquirers,” Pachter said in a research note. The agreement received applause from Weinstein, who called it “probably the biggest content deal in the history of our business.” He joked he had used Netflix as a “babysitter” at times with his two-and-a-half-year-old child. “Moving into the family area is a very smart play in terms of you almost cornering the market,” Weinstein said. Netflix already had deals to stream movies with smaller studios including Weinstein’s studio, The Weinstein Co, as well as Dreamworks Animation and Relativity Media. Sarandos said he had not heard any response to the deal from Carl Icahn, the activist investor who recently purchased a nearly 10 percent stake in the company. Netflix adopted a poison pill defense to prevent a takeover. “This relationship is pretty new,” Sarandos said of Icahn. But he said Icahn has been “publicly and privately very supportive” of Netflix.

375,DIS,UPDATE 4-Netflix to get Disney films in TV distribution deal,"* Disney movies will be available on Netflix starting 2016 * Deal sends Netflix shares soaring 14 percent * Analysts estimate Netflix is paying more than $350 in deal   (Adds analyst on Liberty Media) By Ronald Grover  and Sue Zeidler Dec 4 (Reuters) - Walt Disney gave a much needed boost to Netflix, becoming the first major Hollywood studio to use the video service to bypass premium channels like HBO that traditionally controlled the delivery of movies to TV subscribers. News of the deal, which enables Netflix to stream Disney’s first-run movies to its subscribers, boosted Netflix shares by 14 percent. Liberty Media Corp, whose Starz group now distributes Disney movies on TV, fell almost 5 percent. Investors saw the Netflix-Disney deal as an important endorsement of the DVD rental and streaming service, which has been struggling with slowing subscriber growth and higher costs for content distribution. Disney movies will be available for streaming on Netflix starting in 2016, after its current deal with Liberty Media’s pay-TV channel Starz expires. The deal is for both new Disney movies and library content such as “Dumbo” and “Alice in Wonderland.” “An exclusive deal with Disney differentiates the Netflix content from Hulu Plus and Amazon Instant Video,” said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Barclays Capital. But some analysts worried that Netflix paid too much to get Disney’s movies. Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, estimated in a report that Netflix paid more than $350 million a year for Disney’s movies and said “we would not be surprised if (Netflix) would need to raise capital”. By comparison, HBO agreed to pay an estimated $200 million annually in its so-called “output,” or movie licensing deal, with 20th Century Fox earlier this year, according to the Los Angeles Times. The deal gives Netflix streaming rights to movies from Disney’s live-action and animation studios, including those from  Pixar, Marvel, and the recently acquired Lucasfilm. On Oct. 30, Disney announced a $4 billion deal to purchase the famed studio founded by George Lucas, which will now make new episodes in the blockbuster “Star Wars” series. “This deal brings to our subscribers some of the highest quality, most imaginative family films being made today,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said in a statement. “It’s a leap forward for Internet television.” Movies from Steven Spielberg’s DreamWorks Studios are not included in the deal, as that studio distributes its movies through CBS’s Showtime on TV. Disney recently signed a deal to distribute DreamWorks’ films theatrically after the studio’s deal with Viacom’s Paramount Pictures expired. The deal allows Netflix to stream Disney movies beginning seven to nine months after they appear in theaters, as Starz does now under Disney’s prior agreement. The deal does not cover DVD rentals of Disney movies. Disney said in November that it would shut down its own video streaming service, Disney Movies Online, which had failed to catch on with users. A message on the ‘Disney Movies Online’ website said it would shut down on Dec. 31. Netflix, which started its streaming business with mostly older films, has been moving to add more original programming and produces TV shows such as “Lilyhammer,” which stars “Sopranos” actor Steven Van Zandt as an American gangster who starts a new life in Norway. The company also struck a high-profile deal with actor Kevin Spacey for “House of Cards.” The Disney pact follows similar deals Netflix has inked for new films with smaller studios, including Relativity Media, The Weinstein company and DreamWorks Animation. The agreements have saddled Netflix with nearly $5 billion in contractual commitments over the next three years for deals its made for streaming content, the company said in a recent quarterly earnings report. Netflix’s struggles over the last year, which have included missed subscriber guidance, an ill-fated attempt to split the DVD and streaming operations, and a swooning stock price, recently attracted the attention of billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn. Icahn disclosed in regulatory filings on Oct. 31 that he had amassed a nearly 10 percent stake in the video company and suggested it should pursue a sale. Netflix responded by adopting a poison pill defense. Losing Disney’s movies means Starz is left with only Sony Pictures for film content. The pay-TV channel cast the ending of its agreement with Disney as its decision, saying it preferred  to use the money for original programming creation. Liberty Media’s shares will “rebound,” said Vijay Jayant, an analyst with International Strategy and Investment Group. “We believe it was Starz’ decision to remain prudent and walk away from the bidding for Disney content,” ISI said in a report, estimating that it might have cost Starz $400 million to keep the movies. Without that expense, Starz can step up its production of original series such as “Spartacus” and “Magic City,” which ISI said have become more valuable to cable operators anyway. Netflix shares jumped $10.6491, or 14 percent, to $86.6491. Liberty Media shares fell $5.49, or almost 5 percent, to $105.56.

377,DIS,News Corp publisher's books linked to paper from endangered rainforests-RAN,"* RAN urges HarperCollins avoid Asia Pulp & Paper Co * Conservationists says publisher lags peers like Disney * Indonesia under pressure to reduce deforestation By Michael Taylor JAKARTA, Dec 13 (Reuters) - HarperCollins, a division of News Corp, has been accused by a conservation group of using materials sourced from Indonesia’s endangered rainforests. Independent forensic fiber tests commissioned by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN), showed that some of HarperCollins’ children’s books were printed with rainforest fiber. Indonesia has some of the world’s most biologically diverse forests and is home to endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger. “No child or parent should become an unwitting participant in rainforest destruction this holiday season,” said Robin Averbeck, a forest campaigner at RAN. Averbeck called on HarperCollins not to do business with Indonesian paper firms Asia Pacific Resources International (APRIL) and Asia Pulp and Paper Co Ltd (APP). APP has been accused by other green groups of destroying rainforests. Officials at APP declined to comment. Officials at HarperCollins and APRIL did not respond to multiple telephone calls and emails from Reuters seeking comment. APP and APRIL “are indeed the main culprits here and its good to be clear about that, but as they have not proven very responsive to direct pressure, we are forced to go after their customers to get them to take rainforest destruction seriously and HarperCollins is the sole major U.S. publisher remaining who has not made a firm commitment to stop doing business with them,” RAN spokesman Laurel Sutherlin said. “Most people have never heard of these companies and do not realize they are buying products produced by them, but they do recognise companies like Disney and HarperCollins who are supporting their destructive business practices by purchasing from them.” APP operates under the Sinar Mas brand, as does palm oil giant Sinar Mas Agro Resources & Technology, which has in the past been accused by Greenpeace of bulldozing high conservation value forests and damaging carbon-rich peatlands. APRIL in October disputed many of the accusations against it said it does not source illegally harvested wood and does not source wood from high conservation value forests. The Rainforest Action Network said HarperCollins lagged other U.S. publishers like Walt Disney Co, the world’s biggest publisher of children’s books, when it came to instituting corporate programmes to help protect the world’s rainforests. In October, Disney changed its purchasing policies to reduce paper use and avoid paper harvested from endangered forests. Indonesia is seen as a key player in the fight against climate change and is under intense international pressure to curb deforestation and the destruction of carbon-rich peatlands. Last year, Greenpeace said it had evidence that Barbie doll packaging came from Indonesian rainforests, accusing toy manufacturers such as Mattel Inc and Walt Disney of contributing to Indonesia’s deforestation. Forests in the archipelago have also come under threat from the expanding palm oil industry in recent years, which green groups also blame for deforestation, speeding up climate change and destroying wildlife. Indonesia is the world’s top producer of palm oil, used mainly as an ingredient in food such as biscuits and ice cream and as a biofuel. To improve its green credentials, Indonesia signed a two-year forest moratorium in May last year, although critics say breaches still occur.",12132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-harpercollins-forest/news-corp-publishers-books-linked-to-paper-from-endangered-rainforests-ran-idUSL4N09N0XP20121213

The U.S. publisher had requested information from RAN, including results of the tests, which the green group has refused to share, said Erin Crum, vice president of corporate communications at HarperCollins. Crum said HarperCollins has worked with its printers and mills to eliminate the use of Indonesian fiber from books and that all books manufactured after February 2012 were compliant. “We call on RAN to share its data and findings with us so we can address any anomalies in our supply chain if they exist and we are instituting a testing regime with an independent lab to ensure our that our books are meeting our policy goals,” Crum said.

379,DIS,"UPDATE 1-HBO extends Universal deal, keeping films from Netflix","* Time Warner unit extends deal due to expire in 2015 * Netflix in recent $350 million deal for Disney movies By Ronald Grover  and Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Home Box Office said Sunday it extended its deal with Universal Pictures for the rights to the studio’s movies through 2022, allowing HBO to keep them away from video-streaming rival Netflix, which is aiming to compete with HBO, Showtime and TV outlets. Further details of the agreement were not provided by HBO, a unit of Time Warner, or by Comcast’s Universal studio. Moves by Netflix Inc, which offers subscription video streaming and DVD rentals, to offer original programming and newer movies put it into closer competition with HBO and similar premium TV channels. Last month, Netflix paid what analysts said at the time was more than $350 million for the exclusive rights to stream Disney  movies to TV beginning in 2016, the video company’s first agreement with a major movie studio after pacts with smaller independent studios. Universal’s agreement with HBO was set to expire in 2015, fueling speculation among Hollywood executives that Netflix would also target the studio that produced this year’s breakout hits “Ted” and “Les Miserables.” “With HBO’s far-reaching network of premium services, ranging from the traditional in-home experience to its mobile applications, we are pleased to continue this relationship and bring Universal and Focus Features’ films to HBO subscribers for many years to come,” said Rick Finkelstein, Universal vice chairman and chief operating officer. Netflix spokesman Joris Evers had no comment. In August, HBO renewed its deal with News Corp’s  20th Century Fox that was set to expire in 2015. Terms were not disclosed, but the Los Angeles Times said the channel was expected to pay around $200 million annually for the movies. The Fox deal was extended through 2022. HBO also has a movie pact with “Twilight” studio Summit Entertainment, a unit of Lions Gate Entertainment.

382,DIS,"Disney joins JAKKS, LA billionaire to bring toys to life","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney toys are sold around the world. Now, children can find them in the cloud as well. The media giant is teaming up with toy company JAKKS Pacific and Patrick Soon-Shiong, Los Angeles’ wealthiest person, on a new line of toys - with a nifty technological twist designed to link the goodies that kids lug home from the store with Disney’s stable of well-known animated characters. “DreamPlay”, developed by Soon-Shiong’s NantWorks company, and JAKKS works via an app that can be downloaded on Apple Inc devices like the iPad, or smartphones and tablets running Google Inc Android software. When a device’s camera is trained on any toy specifically designed to work with DreamPlay, it triggers one of thousands of preset animations that appear on the device’s screen and seem to be unfolding in the real world. With viewers’ eyes locked on the tablet or smartphone screen, fairies appear to glide in and out of buildings, animated critters start playing musical instruments, mythical characters prance on a toy piano’s keyboard. Disney, which licensed its characters to DreamPlay, and its partners hope that children will take to the new approach, which is intended to extend and expand the life of the toy. But it remains to be seen if the concept will prove to be more than a novelty, and be able to arrest a child’s infamously short attention span. The three will demo their concept on Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, but Reuters got a sneak peak at the technology on Monday. In a showroom in the 20th floor of a Santa Monica, Calif. building, visitors to JAKKS’ demonstration are treated to an animated version of Sebastian - the red Jamaican crab from Disney’s “Little Mermaid” movie - who pops up onscreen on an iPad seconds after the tablet’s camera is trained on a real-life set of toy bongo drums. The animated crab pounces on the drums and proceeds to bang out a calypso song onscreen, with both Sebastian and the physical drum set appearing together as if the two shared the same cartoon. DreamPlay allows not just Sebastian, but also Tinker Bell and a host of other well-loved Disney characters to “interact” virtually with specially made toys via image-recognition software. The software was developed by Soon-Shiong, a former cancer surgeon who created drugs to fight diabetes and breast cancer and then sold the companies that produced them for $8.6 billion. Soon-Shiong teamed with JAKKS, a $678 million-a-year toy maker and licensee of toys based on the Princess line of dolls, Marvel action figures and other Disney toys, among others. The technology works via the “cloud” - images and video clips stored on remote servers that are streamed to kids’ mobiles when the app recognizes a particular item. “It’s a tremendous way to combine great technology and Disney’s magical story telling to extend the time a child can play with a toy,” said Bob Chapek, president of Disney’s consumer products unit. “Kids find out that playing with their toy doesn’t end when they get it home.” Since taking over in 2011, Chapek has repositioned Disney’s consumer product unit to expand its use of technology with its toys. DreamPlay is the first of what Chapek says are other products that will twin technology with familiar Disney toys, although he won’t name them. Down the road, Disney may explore new business models, including selling subscriptions to content created specifically to be used with a particular toy, said Chapek. The market is hardly certain for a product that requires a child to hold up a phone or tablet, and peer through it to play with a toy that’s stationary. Will children want to see Rapunzel endlessly dancing on the keys of a piano or Rosetta, a fairy from Disney’s “Tinker Bell” movies, fly in and out of a cottage? “The technology may be great, but no one has proven to me yet that a kid will sit in front of an iPhone or iPad instead of playing with a toy that’s right in front of him,” said Sean McGowan, a toy analyst with Needham & Co who downgraded JAKKS to hold in September along with other toy companies, and then downgraded JAKKS to underperform in October. JAKKS intends to begin selling DreamPlay versions of toys from the Disney Princess line in October. It will then expand its offerings next year, with international sales starting in 2014, said Stephen Berman, JAKKS President and CEO.

383,DIS,"Disney joins JAKKS, LA billionaire to bring toys to life","LOS ANGELES, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney toys are sold around the world. Now, children can find them in the cloud as well. The media giant is teaming up with toy company JAKKS Pacific and Patrick Soon-Shiong, Los Angeles’ wealthiest person, on a new line of toys - with a nifty technological twist designed to link the goodies that kids lug home from the store with Disney’s stable of well-known animated characters. “DreamPlay”, developed by Soon-Shiong’s NantWorks company,  and JAKKS works via an app that can be downloaded on Apple Inc  devices like the iPad, or smartphones and tablets running Google Inc Android software. When a device’s camera is trained on any toy specifically designed to work with DreamPlay, it triggers one of thousands of preset animations that appear on the device’s screen and seem to be unfolding in the real world. With viewers’ eyes locked on the tablet or smartphone screen, fairies appear to glide in and out of buildings, animated critters start playing musical instruments, mythical characters prance on a toy piano’s keyboard. Disney, which licensed its characters to DreamPlay, and its partners hope that children will take to the new approach, which is intended to extend and expand the life of the toy. But it remains to be seen if the concept will prove to be more than a novelty, and be able to arrest a child’s infamously short attention span. The three will demo their concept on Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, but Reuters got a sneak peak at the technology on Monday. In a showroom in the 20th floor of a Santa Monica, Calif. building, visitors to JAKKS’ demonstration are treated to an animated version of Sebastian - the red Jamaican crab from Disney’s “Little Mermaid” movie - who pops up onscreen on an iPad seconds after the tablet’s camera is trained on a real-life set of toy bongo drums. The animated crab pounces on the drums and proceeds to bang out a calypso song onscreen, with both Sebastian and the physical drum set appearing together as if the two shared the same cartoon. DreamPlay allows not just Sebastian, but also Tinker Bell and a host of other well-loved Disney characters to “interact” virtually with specially made toys via image-recognition software. The software was developed by Soon-Shiong, a former cancer surgeon who created drugs to fight diabetes and breast cancer and then sold the companies that produced them for $8.6 billion. Soon-Shiong teamed with JAKKS, a $678 million-a-year toy maker and licensee of toys based on the Princess line of dolls, Marvel action figures and other Disney toys, among others. The technology works via the “cloud” - images and video clips stored on remote servers that are streamed to kids’ mobiles when the app recognizes a particular item. “It’s a tremendous way to combine great technology and Disney’s magical story telling to extend the time a child can play with a toy,” said Bob Chapek, president of Disney’s consumer products unit. “Kids find out that playing with their toy doesn’t end when they get it home.” Since taking over in 2011, Chapek has repositioned Disney’s consumer product unit to expand its use of technology with its toys. Dr eamPlay is the first of what Chapek says are other products that will twin technology with familiar Disney toys, although he won’t name them. Down the road, Disney may explore new business models, including selling subscriptions to content created specifically to be used with a particular toy, said Chapek. The market is hardly certain for a product that requires a child to hold up a phone or tablet, and peer through it to play with a toy that’s stationary. Will children want to see Rapunzel endlessly dancing on the keys of a piano or Rosetta, a fairy from Disney’s “Tinker Bell” movies, fly in and out of a cottage? “The technology may be great, but no one has proven to me yet that a kid will sit in front of an iPhone or iPad instead of playing with a toy that’s right in front of him,” said Sean McGowan, a toy analyst with Needham & Co who downgraded JAKKS to hold in September along with other toy companies, an d then downgraded JAKKS to underperform in O c tober. JAKKS intends to begin selling DreamPlay versions of toys from the Disney Princess line in October. It will then expand its offerings next year, with international sales starting in 2014, said Stephen Berman, JAKKS President and CEO.

Disney did not give a reason for the delay, but a source with knowledge of the film said the director was dissatisfied with the script and production budget estimates. The science-fiction movie was set to begin production this spring and be released in April 2014. No new date was announced. “Robopocalypse” is based on Daniel H. Wilson’s futuristic novel about a war between humans and robots intent on destroying them. “It’s about the consequences of creating technologies that make our lives easier, and what happens when that technology becomes smarter than we are,” Spielberg told his “War Horse” star Tom Hiddleston in an interview in early 2012 for Time Out Film. The script, which is being written by “The Cabin in the Woods” writer and director Drew Goddard, wasn’t “landing where Steven wanted it,” according to the source. Disney studio spokesman Paul Roeder had no comment. The film was scheduled to star Anne Hathaway and Chris Hemsworth, according to the movie reference site imdb.com. DreamWorks, a private company half owned by Indian conglomerate Reliance Group, would finance the film with News Corp’s Fox studio, which had co-financed Spielberg’s 2002 futuristic film “Minority Report.” Disney is paid a percentage of a film’s revenues to distribute DreamWorks’ films domestically. It counts on DreamWorks’ movies to reduce its own studio costs while providing it with high profile films. Estimates for “Robopocalypse” were coming in around $160 million, higher than Spielberg wanted, said the source.

Disney’s new “Infinity” concept, to be released in June, comes with games inspired by “Monsters University,” “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “The Incredibles” franchises. The toys will come to life on-screen after being placed on a small electronic portal, similar to Activision Blizzard’s “Skylanders,” one of 2012’s top-selling games. In Disney’s “Infinity,” users will transport Disney and Pixar characters into on-screen adventures by placing their toys on a flat hexagonal board. A starter pack with software, the board and three plastic figurines is priced at $75. Other Disney and Pixar characters will also be incorporated into the platform as the platform evolves, John Lasseter, Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios, said at a launch event in Hollywood, California. The company’s Disney Interactive division, which makes video games and interactive content, has been reporting losses over the last year, and analysts say it badly needs a hit. “We’ve put a big bet on this,” said John Blackburn, vice president and general manager of Disney’s Avalanche Software studio that developed the platform. In 2011, Activision launched “Skylanders,” which connects to consoles such as Microsoft Corp’s Xbox or Sony Corp’s  PlayStation. Activision said this week that the Skylanders franchise hit $500 million in U.S. retail sales. Disney’s Infinity will be able to connect to computers and consoles including Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo’s Wii U. Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said Infinity’s concept is similar to Skylanders, except that it uses better-known characters, like Jack Sparrow of “Pirates of the Caribbean.” “Activision has the lead and the head start,” Bhatia said. He said Activision’s “Skylanders” is heading towards hitting a billion dollars in revenue, making it tough for Disney to compete. Infinity also comes with a “Toy Box” mode, where users can create their own virtual worlds by mixing backdrops and characters from different Pixar and Disney franchises.

RIM announced the partners on Monday, ahead of Wednesday’s launch of its first phones based on its much-delayed BlackBerry 10 smartphone platform, which may be the company’s last chance to regain ground it has lost to Apple Inc’s iPhone. Content partnerships are a crucial part of this effort as analysts have largely attributed the success of iPhone and devices running Google Inc’s Android software to the selection of applications and media content they offer. However, the company’s shares were down more than 4 percent in morning trading. Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said the partnerships were not a surprise and that RIM shareholders were probably selling to take a profit ahead of the phone launch. “Until we start to see the devices sell to consumers, the stock will remain quite volatile,” Walkley said. RIM said its BlackBerry World content store would include an extensive catalog of songs, movies and television shows. Most movies will be available the same day they are released on DVD, with next-day availability for many TV series. RIM’s offerings will also include Matador Records, Rough Trade Records and Sony Music Entertainment music that will be initially be available in 18 countries. The video downloads and rentals will initially be available just in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada and will include TV shows from providers such as ABC Studios, BBC Worldwide and CBS Corp.

396,DIS,"Disney beats estimates, sees stronger quarters ahead","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co beat estimates in quarterly adjusted earnings on Tuesday and said it expects the next few quarters to be better on a stronger lineup of films and growing attendance at its theme parks. The results, which come despite the rising costs of acquiring programming for its ESPN sports juggernaut and included its interactive unit swinging back to profit, helped lift shares in the media giant 1.7 percent in after-hours trading. Net income for its fiscal first quarter fell 6 percent to $1.38 billion. But on an adjusted basis, it posted earnings of 79 cents a share, ahead of the 76 cents forecast by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’re very pleased with our first-quarter results, which set the stage for continued growth in 2013, following a year of record revenue, net income and earnings per share in 2012,” Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said during a call with analysts. Disney, which bought the iconic “Star Wars” series with its$4.06 billion acquisition of director George Lucas’ Lucasfilm of in October, also plans to produce movies based on Lucas properties other than “Star Wars”, said Chairman and CEO Bob Iger. “We have a few scripts in mind,” Iger said. Disney intends to release a new “Star Wars” film in 2015, and plans a new installment every two or three years, and has signed “Star Trek” director J.J. Abrams to direct the first one. Iger also said that the company intends to leverage the “Star Wars” brand across other areas of Disney’s business. Operating profit at Disney’s Media Network’s division, the largest of its five units, increased by 2 percent although earnings at its cable operations were lower due to higher costs for ESPN to carry college football and NFL. Rasulo also said Disney was “exploring an exit” from its ESPN operation in the U.K., adding that the sports channel “had experienced losses due to the ramp-up and newness of that business to us.” Disney’s theme park unit benefited from higher attendance at its domestic theme parks, driven by the new Cars Land attraction it opened at California Adventure in Anaheim, Calif. in June, although higher labor costs at its Disneyland Paris parks weighed. Iger said price hikes at Disney’s parks are possible as it continues to roll out new attractions. “We’ve got some price leverage,” he said. “If you build the right things not only will people come but you get some leverage out of it as well.” Earnings fell 5 percent at Disney’s studios, which it attributed to a stronger slate a year earlier powered by Cars 2 — a film that had worldwide ticket sales of $559.8 million, according to the movie site Box Office Mojo. Its interactive division swung to a profit of $9 million from a loss of $28 million in the prior quarter, although Iger and Rasulo said it would likely revert to a loss in the coming quarter because it has fewer new products to sell. “There were no real surprises, although interactive was probably what surprised us the most on the upside,” said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ABC has sold out its advertising for the upcoming Academy Awards on February 24, the best selling pace in more than a decade. Rasulo said the Oscars had been virtually sold out by Christmas. Ad Age reported that Disney has been commanding between $1.65 million and $1.85 million for a 30-second spot in this year’s Oscar broadcast, citing media buyers and others familiar with the tone of the negotiations. That’s up from the $1.6 million to $1.7 million ABC secured for the 2012 Oscars telecast, Ad Age said. David Miller, analyst with B. Riley Caris, said he was surprised not to see Disney report any charges related to its Lucasfilm acquisition and expects the company may yet announce some restructuring. “We think they’re going to lay some people off,” said Miller. “There’s going to be a lot of restructuring, there’s going to be a lot of charges. But fiscal 2014 looks pretty good,” he said. Before the announcement, Disney closed up 39 cents at $54.29 on the New York Stock Exchange.

397,DIS,"UPDATE 4-Disney beats estimates, sees stronger quarters ahead","* Adjusted earnings 79 cents/share vs f’cast of 76 * See higher theme park attendance, stronger films * Interactive makes small profit * ABC sells out Oscar telecast advertising * Shares rise 1.7 pct in after-hours trade By Ronald Grover  and Sue Zeidler LOS ANGELES, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co beat estimates in quarterly adjusted earnings on Tuesday and said it expects the next few quarters to be better on a stronger lineup of films and growing attendance at its theme parks. The results, which come despite the rising costs of acquiring programming for its ESPN sports juggernaut and included its interactive unit swinging back to profit, helped lift shares in the media giant 1.7 percent in after-hours trading. Net income for its fiscal first quarter fell 6 percent to $1.38 billion. But on an adjusted basis, it posted earnings of 79 cents a share, ahead of the 76 cents forecast by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’re very pleased with our first-quarter results, which set the stage for continued growth in 2013, following a year of record revenue, net income and earnings per share in 2012,” Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said during a call with analysts. Disney, which bought the iconic “Star Wars” series with its$4.06 billion acquisition of director George Lucas’ Lucasfilm of in October, also plans to produce movies based on Lucas properties other than “Star Wars”, said Chairman and CEO Bob Iger. “We have a few scripts in mind,” Iger said. Disney intends to release a new “Star Wars” film in 2015, and plans a new installment every two or three years, and has signed “Star Trek” director J.J. Abrams to direct the first one. Iger also said that the company intends to leverage the “Star Wars” brand across other areas of Disney’s business. Operating profit at Disney’s Media Network’s division, the largest of its five units, increased by 2 percent although earnings at its cable operations were lower due to higher costs for ESPN to carry college football and NFL. Rasulo also said Disney was “exploring an exit” from its ESPN operation in the U.K., adding that the sports channel “had experienced losses due to the ramp-up and newness of that business to us.” Disney’s theme park unit benefited from higher attendance at its domestic theme parks, driven by the new Cars Land attraction it opened at California Adventure in Anaheim, Calif. in June, although higher labor costs at its Disneyland Paris parks weighed. Iger said price hikes at Disney’s parks are possible as it continues to roll out new attractions. “We’ve got some price leverage,” he said. “If you build the right things not only will people come but you get some leverage out of it as well.” Earnings fell 5 percent at Disney’s studios, which it attributed to a stronger slate a year earlier powered by Cars 2 — a film that had worldwide ticket sales of $559.8 million, according to the movie site Box Office Mojo.

401,DIS,UPDATE 1-CalSTRS to oppose dual chairman-CEO role at Disney,"By Lisa Richwine Feb 14 (Reuters) - The California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) said on Thursday it will oppose Walt Disney Co’s combination of the CEO and chairman roles, and its executive pay plan at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in March. The second-largest U.S. pension fund owns about 5.3 million Disney shares, a 0.3 percent stake worth $263 million. Robert Iger became CEO of the media and theme park company in 2005 and was elected chairman at last year’s annual meeting. He received $40.2 million in total compensation last year, according to regulatory filings. “Here we go again, sliding back into a governance structure that has already proved detrimental to the company’s long-term growth and to its shareholders’ interests,” said Anne Sheehan, CalSTRS director of corporate governance. Disney, in its proxy statement released on Jan. 18, said the company recorded a total shareholder return of 139 percent during Iger’s tenure, far above the 36 percent return for the S&P; 500 during the same time. Ninety-two percent of Iger’s compensation is contingent upon the financial results and stock performance, Disney said. CalSTRS’ Sheehan said investors have “been through this fight before” in 2004 and 2005, leading to the ouster of then-CEO Michael Eisner and the splitting of the roles. CalSTRS said it will support a shareholder proposal from the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds to keep the roles separate in the future, except under “extraordinary circumstances.” CalSTRS also said it will vote “no” in a non-binding vote on executive compensation. In its regulatory filing, Disney urged shareholders to vote against the proposal to split the jobs “because it seeks to replace the current, clear and workable standard for electing a chairman with a vague and unworkable standard.” Disney’s annual meeting will take place on March 6 in Phoenix. Institutional Shareholder Services, a shareholder governance group and the treasurer for the state of Connecticut, objected last year to Iger holding both jobs.

404,DIS,"Proxy advisers urge split of chair, CEO roles at Disney","(Reuters) - Proxy advisers ISS and Glass, Lewis & Co urged Walt Disney Co shareholders to vote in favor of a proposal to split the chairman and chief executive roles now both held by Robert Iger. The influential proxy advisers in reports provided on Tuesday also urged shareholders to cast advisory ballots “against” the pay of Iger and others at Disney. The recommendations could sway undecided shareholders ahead of Disney’s annual meeting scheduled for March 6 in Phoenix, Arizona. A controversial issue at the media and theme park company has been the dual roles of Iger, Disney’s CEO since 2005. The board added the chairman’s title to Iger’s role at last year’s annual meeting, despite similar objections from ISS and public pension funds at that time that the combination gave him too much power. Investors have gained traction on this issue at corporations such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, where last year 40 percent of shares were voted in favor of a measure to strip CEO Jamie Dimon of his chairman title. Overseers of government worker pension funds last week said they filed a measure for JPMorgan’s meeting this year. Sponsors of the JPMorgan measure include pension funds overseen by Connecticut State Treasurer Denise Nappier. Similarly, at Disney the Connecticut funds are also sponsors this year of a proxy resolution urging the board to split the chairman and CEO roles except in “extraordinary circumstances.” The Disney resolution has already gained support from the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS). On Tuesday, the Disney measure also won backing from John Liu, New York City comptroller, who oversees pension funds holding Disney shares and is also a sponsor of the JPMorgan resolution. “The Walt Disney Company needs a board chair who is independent of the company to best oversee management,” Liu said in an emailed statement. In its proxy statement in January, Disney urged shareholders to vote against the proposal to split Iger’s jobs “because it seeks to replace the current, clear and workable standard for electing a chairman with a vague and unworkable standard.” A Disney spokeswoman said on Tuesday the company recorded a total shareholder return of 139 percent during Iger’s tenure, far above the 36 percent return for the S&P; 500 during the same time, as well as record revenue and profit in fiscal 2012. “Disney has delivered results that speak for themselves,” the spokeswoman said. Ninety-two percent of Iger’s compensation is contingent upon the financial results and stock performance, Disney said. Disney also named an independent lead director, Orin Smith, in March 2012.

407,DIS,"Balloon blitz promotes Disney's 'Oz,' studio franchise strategy","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A bright blue hot-air balloon whisked James Franco to the premiere of his new Walt Disney Co movie, “Oz the Great and Powerful,” delivering the star to Hollywood Boulevard where he walked an emerald green carpet with a yellow-brick road into the El Capitan Theatre. The high-flying, and headline-grabbing, entrance last month was the signature event of a Disney marketing blitz on major TV broadcasts, social media and at Disney parks to stoke interest in “Oz,” a $200 million production that is its first release of an expensive 2013 film slate. It debuts in theaters March 8. The 3D “Oz” also debuts the first full year of Disney CEO Bob Iger’s strategy of investing in films with hefty budgets that the media giant can turn into “brands” that bring in box office receipts, spawn movie sequels, drive toy sales and inspire theme-park rides. After “Oz” lands in theaters, the Burbank-based company scheduled three movies with budgets of more than $185 million for release through July 3, which is when it expects to unveil the $225 million film “The Lone Ranger,” starring Johnny Depp as the masked man’s sidekick Tonto. “If anyone else tried it, it would be a very risky strategy,” said Peter Sealey, former head of marketing at Columbia Pictures and founder of The Sausalito Group. “They’re the only ones who could do it, based on the breadth of their company, the movies they have and their ability to squeeze money out of any film they make,” Sealey added. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t have an Oz ride opening next week in Orlando.” Following “Oz,” Disney is scheduled to release on May 3 the third installment of its Marvel unit’s giant hit “Iron Man” movies starring Robert Downey Jr. On June 21, it debuts “Monsters University,” a “prequel” to Pixar’s 2001 blockbuster “Monsters, Inc.” that generated $562 million in worldwide tickets sales. The Disney version of “Oz” is a prequel to the 1939 classic “The Wizard of Oz” and tells the story a small-time magician played by Franco who is mistaken for a wizard and becomes the leader of the land of munchkins and witches. “Oz” looks like a hit, said Phil Contrino, chief analyst for Boxoffice.com. He projects U.S. and Canadian ticket sales of $65 million over the first three days, placing it among the industry’s biggest March openings. Nostalgia surrounding the original film will help bring families to theaters, he said. “Look at success of ‘Wicked’ on Broadway,” he said. “People are open to the idea of the ‘Wizard of Oz’ being played around with and new approaches taken.” Disney is taking no chances, and is spending up to $100 million on marketing to supplement nostalgia. The company launched a New Year’s campaign with a social media sweepstakes urging fans to tweet resolutions with the #DisneyOz hashtag. The “Oz” hot-air balloon, emblazoned with #DisneyOZ, made stops at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California, and the Daytona 500, where Franco was grand marshal. It is heading to Central Park next week and an appearance on “Good Morning America” on Disney-owned ABC. Television promotions for the film have been hard to miss. Disney ran a pricey commercial during the CBS telecast of the Super Bowl. It also enlisted Mariah Carey to sing a song from the film on Fox singing contest “American Idol,” according to producer Joe Roth. On ABC’s “The Bachelor,” host Chris Harrison interrupted the dating competition to introduce a brief appearance by Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz, the actresses who play the film’s three witches. A pair of Dorothy’s red slippers from the original “Wizard of Oz” made an appearance at ABC’s Academy Awards broadcast in a glass case, which was covered until red carpet host Kristin Chenoweth unveiled it. Disney experienced the expensive downside of its big-budget film strategy last year, when the $250 million film “John Carter” became one of Hollywood’s costliest flops, saddling Disney’s studio with an operating loss of $84 million for the fiscal second quarter. Only a couple months later, Disney saw the other side of releasing a big-budget movie when Marvel superhero mashup “The Avengers” recorded the biggest domestic debut of all time and earned more than $1.5 billion around the world. After “John Carter” bombed, Disney named a new studio head, Alan Horn, a former Warner Bros. executive with a record of success managing “Harry Potter,” “The Dark Knight” and other major film franchises. It also geared up its vaunted marketing machine, partnering with the HSN shopping network on an Oz-inspired fashion line and setting up a “Land of Oz” garden at Epcot, on top of the millions it spent elsewhere. “You have to hand it to Disney,” said Jeff Bock, box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. “They do go all out. They’re going to spend $200 or $250 million on these productions and make a real spectacle.” ",3012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-oz/balloon-blitz-promotes-disneys-oz-studio-franchise-strategy-idUSBRE9200H720130301

409,DIS,"Disney shareholders back board, reject CEO/chair split","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co shareholders on Wednesday re-elected the company’s board, including Chairman and Chief Executive Bob Iger, and rejected an investor proposal to separate the roles of chairman and CEO in 2016, when Iger plans to leave the company. Shareholders of the media and theme-park company defeated the proposal from Connecticut State Treasurer Denise Nappier, a Disney investor through the state’s employee retirement funds, to split the CEO and chairman jobs. About 35.3 percent of ballots cast supported the plan, according to figures reported at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Phoenix. The results were preliminary, based on votes submitted before the meeting. Iger, who has served as Disney’s CEO since 2005, won re-election to the board with support of 98.3 percent of votes cast. The nine other board members received at least 86.6 percent favorable votes. At the start of the meeting, Iger touted Disney’s recent financial performance. “Yesterday our stock price hit an all-time high. Market cap hit a record $102 billion,” he said. The board gave Iger, 62, the added title of chairman at the 2012 annual meeting, where he was elected by shareholders. Also at that meeting, the board named former Starbucks Corp CEO Orin Smith as Disney’s independent lead director at meeting. For some shareholders, Iger’s dual roles recalled the turbulence surrounding former CEO Michael Eisner, stripped of his chairmanship in 2004 following a campaign by Walt Disney’s nephew, Roy Disney, to drive him from the company. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and New York City Comptroller John Liu, who oversees the city’s pension funds, supported the Connecticut resolution that urged the board to split the jobs except under “extraordinary circumstances,” when the posts could be held jointly for no more than six months. “A large, highly integrated organization like Disney simply does not work most effectively when the CEO manages the board responsible for overseeing him and evaluating his performance,” said Suzanne Hopgood, who spoke at the meeting on behalf of Connecticut Treasurer Nappier. Proxy advisers ISS and Glass, Lewis & Co also recommended ahead of the meeting that shareholders vote for separation of the roles, and against the pay for Iger and other executives. In a regulatory filing in January, Disney urged shareholders to vote against the proposal to split the chairman and CEO jobs, pointing to the company’s financial record under Iger. Disney has recorded a total shareholder return of 139 percent during Iger’s tenure, far above the 36 percent return for the S&P; 500 during the same time, the company said. At Wednesday’s meeting, board member Smith said the decision to offer Iger the chairman’s job was made “in the best interest of shareholders.” Smith said: “It was clear that Disney had an exceptional CEO,” and the chairman’s job will keep him at the company for an additional 15 months.” Shareholders approved the compensation packages for Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote, with 57.6 percent approval among the ballots cast. CalSTRS criticized the structure of long-term incentives ahead of the meeting and had urged votes against it. Iger received $40.2 million in total compensation last year, according to regulatory filings. Disney shareholders also rejected a proposal from European institutional investor Legal & General Investment Management that the company allow shareholders holding 3 percent or more of its shares to place candidates on the ballot alongside board-nominated candidates. About 39.8 percent of voters supported the measure. Shares of Disney slipped 0.3 percent to $56.34 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

410,DIS,"UPDATE 2-Disney shareholders back board, reject CEO/chair split","By Lisa Richwine March 6 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co shareholders on Wednesday re-elected the company’s board, including Chairman and Chief Executive Bob Iger, and rejected an investor proposal to separate the roles of chairman and CEO in 2016, when Iger plans to leave the company. Shareholders of the media and theme-park company defeated the proposal from Connecticut State Treasurer Denise Nappier, a Disney investor through the state’s employee retirement funds, to split the CEO and chairman jobs. About 35.3 percent of ballots cast supported the plan, according to figures reported at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Phoenix. The results were preliminary, based on votes submitted before the meeting. Iger, who has served as Disney’s CEO since 2005, won re-election to the board with support of 98.3 percent of votes cast. The nine other board members received at least 86.6 percent favorable votes. At the start of the meeting, Iger touted Disney’s recent financial performance. “Yesterday our stock price hit an all-time high. Market cap hit a record $102 billion,” he said. The board gave Iger, 62, the added title of chairman at the 2012 annual meeting, where he was elected by shareholders. Also at that meeting, the board named former Starbucks Corp  CEO Orin Smith as Disney’s independent lead director at meeting.

411,DIS,UPDATE 1-Disney's 'Oz' prequel scores box office gold,"* Strong $80.3 mln opening in U.S., Canada * Domestic debut is biggest so far in 2013 * International sales for ‘Oz’ add $69.9 mln By Lisa Richwine and Andrea Burzynski LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Reuters) - There was no place like “Oz” at the weekend box office. Walt Disney Co’s big-budget 3D movie “Oz the Great and Powerful” amassed $80.3 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales, the biggest domestic debut of 2013. The prequel starring James Franco added $69.9 million in international markets, Disney said, for a combined $150.2 million opening around the world. “Oz” dominated all other movies over the weekend, according to studio estimates released on Sunday. Another family film, “Jack the Giant Slayer,” finished a distant No. 2 with $10 million domestically during its second weekend. Melissa McCarthy comedy “Identity Thief” landed third with $6.3 million from Friday through Sunday. The opening numbers for “Oz” provided a strong start for the $200-million production, a prequel to 1939 Hollywood classic “The Wizard of Oz.” The movie stars Franco as a small-time magician who is whisked by hot-air balloon to a magical land where he is mistaken for a wizard. Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz play three witches the wizard encounters on his journey. Disney spent up to $100 million on a marketing campaign that featured the cross-country tour of a bright blue, Oz-themed hot-air balloon, a commercial during the Super Bowl, and movie-related fashions sold on shopping channel HSN. The expensive gamble paid off as families turned out to see the story of how the famous wizard came to lead the colorful land of Oz. Disney’s executive vice president for motion picture distribution Dave Hollis said the film hit a “sweet spot” in terms of timing; over the next few weeks, there will be little competition in the family film market, and many kids in the United States will be on school breaks and thus more likely to head to theaters. He was mum on reports of a sequel. “It’s too early to say too much,” Hollis said. “I’m not really a part of that conversation at this time.” Before the weekend, Disney had projected domestic sales of around $70 million, while some box-office analysts saw receipts hitting as much as $85 million. The big debut for “Oz” outshined the sluggish opening a week earlier for “Jack the Giant Slayer,” another family-oriented film that puts a modern spin on a classic children’s tale. The new take on “Jack and the Beanstalk,” which cost $189 million to produce, pulled in $27.2 million at North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters during its first three days. Through Sunday, “Jack” had earned a total of $43.8 million domestically, plus $22.6 million from international markets. The weekend’s other new release, thriller “Dead Man Down,” landed in fourth place on North American charts with $5.4 million. The movie stars Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace as two strangers who join together to seek revenge against a New York crime lord. Drug drama “Snitch” took fifth place with $5.1 million in domestic sales. Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc, released “Jack the Giant Slayer.” “Identity Thief” was distributed by  Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast Corp. Privately held FilmDistrict released “Dead Man Down.” “21 and Over” was released by privately held Relativity Media.",3102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/boxoffice/update-1-disneys-oz-prequel-scores-box-office-gold-idUSL1N0C21WE20130310
412,DIS,New Mickey Mouse cartoons coming to Disney Channel,"(Reuters) - New Mickey Mouse cartoons will come to TV this summer when the Disney Channel premieres a series of short cartoons featuring the comic antics of the 85-year-old children’s character with contemporary touches. The 19 cartoons, each a couple minutes long, are being produced with 2D animation to pay homage to the artistry of Walt Disney and his animators in the 1920s and 1930s, Walt Disney Co said in a statement on Tuesday. Mickey will appear in modern settings, such as riding a motorcycle through Paris. He also will visit New York, Beijing, Venice and other cities and encounter other Disney characters, including Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy. The new cartoons will air on the Disney Channel, disney.com and the Watch Disney Channel mobile app starting June 28, Disney said. Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse in 1928. Mickey also appears in the computer-generated animated series “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse” on the Disney Channel.

414,DIS,TV website Hulu elevates content chief to acting CEO,"LOS ANGELES, March 14 (Reuters) - Video website Hulu on Thursday said that content chief Andy Forssell will lead the company as acting CEO while owners Walt Disney Co and News Corp decide on the future of the streaming video service. Forssell, currently senior vice president of content, will take over after CEO Jason Kilar departs later this month, according to a post by Kilar on the Hulu blog. Kilar announced on Jan. 4 that he planned to leave the company. “Disney and News Corporation are currently finalizing their forward-looking plans with Hulu, and the senior team has been working closely with them in that process,” Kilar wrote. “Once the plans are finalized, a permanent decision will be made regarding the CEO position.” The third media company co-owner, NBC Universal, is not allowed to take part in any managerial decisions under an agreement with U.S. regulators after Comcast Corp took control of NBC Universal in 2011. Hulu started primarily as a free, ad-supported site for people to catch up on television shows they might have missed. It now includes an $8-a-month Hulu Plus service that includes additional content including original programming. Kilar previously said Hulu earned $700 million in revenue in 2012 and had more than 3 million paying subscribers.",3142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/television-hulu/tv-website-hulu-elevates-content-chief-to-acting-ceo-idUSL1N0C6J9W20130314
415,DIS,"Disney's ""Oz"" keeps magic spell on movie box office","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s “Oz the Great and Powerful” worked more box office magic in its second weekend, following up its strong debut a week earlier with $42.2 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales. The “Wizard of Oz” prequel starring James Franco topped a stronger-than-expected performance from “The Call,” a new thriller about a 911 operator played by Halle Berry who tries to save a kidnapped teenager. “The Call” earned $17.1 million from Friday through Sunday, according to studio estimates. “The Incredible Burt Wonderstone,” a new comedy featuring Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey as dueling Las Vegas magicians, finished the weekend in third place. It conjured up $10.3 million at North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters - several million less than expected. Domestic ticket sales for the big-budget, effects-filled “Oz” dropped 47 percent from its opening weekend, according to the box office division of Hollywood.com. Movies typically see a 40 percent to 60 percent decline in their second weekend of release. “Oz” added $46.6 million over the weekend from international markets. Its global total after 10 days reached $282 million, a strong start for a movie that cost $200 million to make plus up to $100 million more to market. “The Call” handily beat pre-weekend forecasts of a debut of around $10 million. The $15 million production overperformed on strong word-of-mouth, showing itself to be “a real crowd-pleaser,” said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Sony Corp’s Sony Pictures studio, which acquired the film from Troika Pictures. “People like this film a lot, and it’s going to be a big success for us,” Bruer said, adding that “the film could end up doing anywhere from $40 million to $50 million, which would be huge.” “Burt Wonderstone,” meanwhile, fell short of some pre-weekend forecasts, which had pegged the debut at $12 million to $15 million. The film had a modest budget of about $30 million, according to Warner Bros. “Obviously we didn’t want to come in number-three this weekend, but it’s not for lack of trying,” said Dan Fellman, Warner Bros. president of theatrical distribution. The executive said the studio harbored hopes that upcoming school spring breaks would stoke the film’s box office, adding that “with the budget being as reasonable as it was, I’m sure at the end of the day that we’ll be okay.” Rounding out the top of the charts, the big-budget film “Jack the Giant Slayer” took fourth place with $6.2 million domestically. The global total for the March 1 release, which is trying to make back a $189 million production cost, reached nearly $90 million. In fifth place, Melissa McCarthy comedy “Identity Thief” added $4.5 million to its impressive $123.7 million total. “Jack the Giant Slayer” was released by Warner Bros. “Identity Thief” was distributed by Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast Corp.

The studio job cuts will center on the marketing and home video units and include a small number from the animation wing, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans had not been made public. It is unknown how many jobs will be lost at either division. Staff reductions at the consumer products unit will largely result from attrition, another person said.

A Disney spokeswoman had no comment. Disney, headquartered in Burbank, California, started an internal cost-cutting review late last year to identify cutbacks in jobs it no longer needs because of improvements in technology, one of the people said. It is also looking at redundant operations that could be eliminated following a string of major acquisitions over the past few years, said the person. Disney cut about 200 people at its Disney Interactive video game last year, as the company moved away from console games to focus on online and mobile entertainment. An additional 100 staffers have been laid off in two cuts since.

424,DIS,Disney child star Annette Funicello dies at age 70,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Annette Funicello, America’s girl next door who captured the innocence of the 1950s and 1960s as a Disney Mouseketeer and the star of beach party movies, died on Monday at age 70, the Walt Disney Co. said. Funicello died at Mercy Southwest Hospital in Bakersfield, California, from complications of multiple sclerosis, the television and film studio said. Her family told celebrity news television program “Extra” that Funicello had been in a coma. “Annette was and always will be a cherished member of the Disney family, synonymous with the word Mouseketeer, and a true Disney legend,” Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co., said in a statement. “She will forever hold a place in our hearts as one of Walt Disney’s brightest stars, delighting an entire generation of baby boomers with her jubilant personality and endless talent,” he said. Funicello caught the public eye as a 12-year-old in 1955 when she became one of the original members of Disney’s “The Mickey Mouse Club,” a trademark show of the clean-cut fifties. She went on to star in a series of beach movies in the 1960s including “Beach Party,” “Bikini Beach” and the hit “Beach Blanket Bingo,” released in 1965 and co-starring teen idol Frankie Avalon. In later life, she was remembered for her valiant fight against multiple sclerosis, a crippling disease of the nervous system that she developed in the late 1980s. It led the once-vivacious singer and actress to depend first on a cane, then a walker and finally a wheelchair. “We are so sorry to lose Mother,” Funicello’s children, Jack, Jason and Gina, said in a statement. “She is no longer suffering anymore and is now dancing in heaven. We love and will miss her terribly.” Funicello was by far the most popular of the dozen or so youngsters who donned Mouseketeers outfits for the Disney show and received the most fan mail. As she matured from child to young woman she outgrew the Mouseketeers but remained in demand, guest-starring in fifties-era TV staples such as “The Danny Thomas Show” and “Zorro.” Funicello had her own TV series, “Annette,” in 1958 in which she played a country girl living with relatives in the big city. The series lasted only one season. She moved to the big screen in 1957 with “Johnny Tremaine,” an American Revolutionary War drama, and co-starred in “The Shaggy Dog” in 1959. But it was a string of beach and surfing movies in the sixties with bubble-gum heartthrob Avalon that really brought Funicello fame and fortune. After starring in the 1968 rock’n’roll comedy “Head,” Funicello disappeared from the big screen. She remained active on television, however, and acted as spokesperson for Skippy peanut butter for nearly 20 years. She re-emerged with Avalon to reprise their sand-and-surf roles in “Back to the Beach ‘87.” It was while making that movie that Funicello began to experience the first symptoms of MS, although she did not know it at the time. In 1992 she announced that she had been suffering from MS for five years. Funicello was born in Utica, New York, and the family moved to California when she was a child. Her father, Joe, was a mechanic and her mother, Virginia, devoted herself to her daughter’s show-business career once she became a Mouseketeer. Funicello married Hollywood agent Jack Gilardi in 1965 and the couple had three children. The couple divorced in 1981, and she married racehorse breeder Glen Holt in 1986.

Her family told celebrity news television program “Extra” that Funicello had been in a coma. “Annette was and always will be a cherished member of the Disney family, synonymous with the word Mouseketeer, and a true Disney legend,” Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co., said in a statement. “She will forever hold a place in our hearts as one of Walt Disney’s brightest stars, delighting an entire generation of baby boomers with her jubilant personality and endless talent,” he said. Funicello caught the public eye as a 12-year-old in 1955 when she became one of the original members of Disney’s “The Mickey Mouse Club,” a trademark show of the clean-cut fifties. She went on to star in a series of beach movies in the 1960s including “Beach Party,” “Bikini Beach” and the hit “Beach Blanket Bingo,” released in 1965 and co-starring teen idol Frankie Avalon. In later life, she was remembered for her valiant fight against multiple sclerosis, a crippling disease of the nervous system that she developed in the late 1980s. It led the once-vivacious singer and actress to depend first on a cane, then a walker and finally a wheelchair. “We are so sorry to lose Mother,” Funicello’s children, Jack, Jason and Gina, said in a statement. “She is no longer suffering anymore and is now dancing in heaven. We love and will miss her terribly.” Funicello was by far the most popular of the dozen or so youngsters who donned Mouseketeers outfits for the Disney show and received the most fan mail. As she matured from child to young woman she outgrew the Mouseketeers but remained in demand, guest-starring in fifties-era TV staples such as “The Danny Thomas Show” and “Zorro.” Funicello had her own TV series, “Annette,” in 1958 in which she played a country girl living with relatives in the big city. The series lasted only one season. She moved to the big screen in 1957 with “Johnny Tremaine,” an American Revolutionary War drama, and co-starred in “The Shaggy Dog” in 1959. But it was a string of beach and surfing movies in the sixties with bubble-gum heartthrob Avalon that really brought Funicello fame and fortune. After starring in the 1968 rock’n’roll comedy “Head,” Funicello disappeared from the big screen. She remained active on television, however, and acted as spokesperson for Skippy peanut butter for nearly 20 years. She re-emerged with Avalon to reprise their sand-and-surf roles in “Back to the Beach ‘87.” It was while making that movie that Funicello began to experience the first symptoms of MS, although she did not know it at the time. In 1992 she announced that she had been suffering from MS for five years. Funicello was born in Utica, New York, and the family moved to California when she was a child. Her father, Joe, was a mechanic and her mother, Virginia, devoted herself to her daughter’s show-business career once she became a Mouseketeer. Funicello married Hollywood agent Jack Gilardi in 1965 and the couple had three children. The couple divorced in 1981, and she married racehorse breeder Glen Holt in 1986.

Her family told television program “Extra” that Funicello died in hospital in Bakersfield, California, while in a coma due to suffering from multiple sclerosis, which was diagnosed in 1987. It was not immediately clear when she died. Funicello was America’s peaches-and-cream girl, portraying the innocence of the 1950s and 1960s, first as a Disney Mouseketeer and then as the star of a series of beach movies. But in later life, she was remembered for what many say was her greatest role: a valiant fight against multiple sclerosis, a crippling disease of the nervous system which reduced the once perky and vivacious singer and actress to depend progressively on a cane, a walker and finally a wheelchair.

430,DIS,"'Iron Man 3' kicks off US, Canada run with $15.6 mln ticket sales","May 3 (Reuters) - International hit “Iron Man 3” flew into U.S. and Canadian theaters, kicking off Hollywood’s summer blockbuster season with $15.6 million in ticket sales late Thursday and early Friday. The superhero sequel from Walt Disney Co’s Marvel studio is expected to finish the weekend with one of the biggest debuts in film history. Box office analysts predict the movie will bring in $150 million or more from Friday through Sunday, likely ranking in the top five all-time openings. The opening night sales fell short of the $18.7 million earned a year ago by Disney’s “The Avengers,” which brought together Iron Man, The Hulk and other Marvel superheroes. “Avengers” went on to earn $207 million in its first three days, a record for the North American (U.S. and Canadian) market. “Iron Man 3,” starring Robert Downey Jr. as billionaire businessman Tony Stark, has pulled in $345.4 million in overseas markets since it debuted April 24, Disney said on Friday. The film set opening day records in several countries including China and Russia. In “Iron Man 3,” Stark fights to save the world from an extremist known as The Mandarin, played by Ben Kingsley.

431,DIS,"UPDATE 1-'Iron Man 3' soars with huge $175.3 mln in US, Canada debut","NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Superhero sequel “Iron Man 3” rocketed to the top of U.S. and Canadian box office charts, kicking off Hollywood’s summer movie season with $175.3 million in weekend ticket sales for the second-biggest film opening of all time. Combined with international sales, the movie from Walt Disney Co’s Marvel studio brought its global haul to an estimated $680.1 million, Disney said on Sunday. The film stars Robert Downey Jr. as billionaire businessman Tony Stark, whose superhero alter-ego spars with an evil extremist. “Iron Man 3” fed off the success of the first two installments plus last year’s “The Avengers,” a superhero mashup that united Iron Man, The Hulk and other Marvel characters. “Avengers” opened on the same weekend last year with $207.4 million over its first three days, a record for the United States and Canada. “Iron Man 3” finished second on the all-time list behind “Avengers” and ahead of the July 2011 release of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,” which opened with $169.2 million, according to the box office division of Hollywood.com. “It is an extraordinary start,” said Dave Hollis, Disney’s executive vice president of distribution. “The start on the U.S. side is something that we are exceptionally proud of.” The $200-million production is another hit for Disney, which is focusing its movie studio on franchise films like “Iron Man” that can spawn movie sequels, toy sales and theme-park rides. The two previous “Iron Man” movies earned a combined $1.2 billion around the world, according to the Box Office Mojo website. “Iron Man 3” debuted in international markets starting April 24 to record openings in many countries including China and Russia, generating buzz ahead of its release the United States and Canada. The big domestic numbers for “Iron Man 3” boosted the overall box office, which is dragging behind 2012 after a sluggish winter and spring. Studios are counting on summer action films, superhero stories and sequels to lift ticket sales in the coming months. Future releases include sci-fi sequel “Star Trek Into Darkness,” Superman reboot “Man of Steel” and robot-versus-aliens action flick “Pacific Rim.” The “Iron Man” mania trounced all other movies over the weekend. Last week’s winner, dark action comedy “Pain & Gain,” dropped to second place with $7.6 million. Baseball drama “42” took the No. 3 slot with $6.2 million. Rounding out the top five, Tom Cruise’s post-apocalyptic thriller “Oblivion” grossed $5.79 million, and the animated film “The Croods” rang up $4.2 million. “Pain & Gain” was released by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom Inc. Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures distributed “Oblivion.” Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc , released “42.”",5052013,http://www.reuters.com/article/boxoffice/update-1-iron-man-3-soars-with-huge-175-3-mln-in-us-canada-debut-idUSL2N0DK20V20130505

433,DIS,"Electronic Arts, Disney strike ""Star Wars"" games deal","SAN FRANCISCO, May 6 (Reuters) - Electronic Arts and Walt Disney Co sealed a multi-year licensing deal under which the video game publisher will develop games for mobile devices, PCs and consoles based on the “Star Wars” movies. Disney, which bought George Lucas’s Lucasfilm Ltd and the blockbuster sci-fi franchise for $4.05 billion in October, will retain the rights to develop online and mobile games, both companies said in a statement on Monday. They did not reveal the financial terms of the agreement. EA bet big on the Star Wars’ world of jedis and wookies in 2011 by releasing its “Star Wars: The Old Republic” - a massive multiplayer player online game, or MMO, that allows thousands of people to play simultaneously for a monthly subscription fee as opposed to a one-time purchase. Analysts said EA made a record investment of between $100 million and $300 million to build “Star Wars: The Old Republic,” but EA has not disclosed costs. It hired more than 1,000 voice actors for “Star Wars: The Old Republic,” which broke a game industry record. But the game has struggled to retain players, prompting the company to offer 15 game levels for free in June last year. And in November, it launched a free-to-play version of the game. Disney, which has its own interactive games division, last month shut the 30-year-old LucasArts games studio it inherited with the acquisition to focus on licensing its “Star Wars” brand externally. EA shares were up 2 percent at $18.67 and Disney’s stock was up slightly at $65.17 in after-hours trading.",5062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/electronicarts-starwars/electronic-arts-disney-strike-star-wars-games-deal-idUSL2N0DN1N820130506
434,DIS,"Disney's profit rises on parks, 'Oz' movie","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Media giant Walt Disney Co reported a 32 percent increase in profit that beat Wall Street expectations, boosted by higher spending and attendance at U.S. theme parks, and the movie box office success of “Oz the Great and Powerful.” Revenue for the company that operates cable networks, theme parks and a movie studio increased 10 percent to $10.6 billion. At the parks division, revenue gained 14 percent and operating income climbed 73 percent as resorts in Florida and California attracted more visitors and guests spent more. CEO Bob Iger said Disney parks drew more visitors thanks to investments in new attractions such as Cars Land at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, and the expansion of Fantasyland at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. “The product that we recently put online really worked, like California Adventure and Fantasyland, and the product we had online for years and years in many respects looked better to consumers,” Iger told analysts on a conference call. Profit rose 8 percent at the media networks unit, the company’s largest division, helped by higher advertising and fees from cable operators at sports network ESPN. Those strong performances helped offset a poor showing by the broadcasting division. Operating income declined by 40 percent at the broadcasting unit, as the ABC television network brought in less advertising revenue amid a ratings slump and higher programming costs. Iger said he wanted a stronger primetime lineup at the channel, with more shows produced by ABC rather than other studios. “We could use a few more hits, and certainly a few more hits that we own,” he said. Overall, net income increased 32 percent from a year earlier to $1.5 billion for January through March, Disney said on Tuesday. Adjusted earnings per share rose 36 percent to 79 cents, beating Wall Street expectations of 77 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Disney’s movie studio recorded a profit of $118 million, compared with a loss a year earlier from the box office bomb “John Carter.” This year, the “Wizard of Oz” prequel lifted second-quarter results. The studio also is looking at a big third quarter with current blockbuster “Iron Man 3,” a Marvel superhero sequel that has grossed $711 million around the world since its release. Disney is working on sequels to the “Star Wars” franchise after last year’s $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm. The company is also developing “Star Wars” properties for television and parks, Iger said. The interactive gaming division recorded a loss of $54 million. Iger had set a goal of turning the unit profitable in 2013. He told analysts it was now “doubtful” the unit will break even this year after the company delayed the release of its Infinity games and toys initiative to August from June. Infinity “is going to help drive profitability for fiscal 2014,” he said. Shares of Disney fell to $65.28 in after-hours trading, a 1.2 percent drop from their earlier close of $66.07 on the New York Stock Exchange.

444,DIS,UPDATE 2-Disneyland employee arrested in suspected dry ice explosion,"By Dan Whitcomb LOS ANGELES, May 29 (Reuters) - A Disneyland employee has been arrested on suspicion of possessing a destructive device following a small explosion in a trash can at the California theme park on Tuesday that prompted the evacuation of Mickey’s Toontown, police said on Wednesday. Christian Barnes, identified as a 22-year-old outdoor vending cast member at Walt Disney Co’s Disneyland, was being held on $1 million bail, Sergeant Bob Dunn of the Anaheim Police Department said in a statement. “Barnes is cooperating with investigators and has indicated that this is an isolated incident with unanticipated impacts,” Dunn said. Dunn said a police search of the area where the explosion occurred turned up evidence of a dry ice explosion. A Disneyland spokeswoman, Suzi Brown, said the incident appears to have been a prank and the theme park was working closely with local authorities. She said the company was considering whether to suspend or terminate Barnes. The small explosion in a trash can, shortly before 5:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, prompted the evacuation of Mickey’s Toontown, a theme area where children can visit the cartoon-style homes of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters. Visitors were allowed to return about two hours later after police cleared the scene. There were no reports of damage or injury. Dunn said that Anaheim police officers assisted by the Orange County Sheriff’s Bomb Squad searched the trash can and found remnants of a water bottle, which he said was indicative of a dry ice explosion. Dunn said that Barnes, of Long Beach, California, was booked into the Anaheim Police Department on suspicion of possessing a destructive device. Disneyland, located in Anaheim some 35 miles southeast of Los Angeles, is Disney’s original theme park and one of the nation’s top tourist draws. The 57-year-old park attracted more than 16 million visitors in 2011, the most recent year statistics were available, according to trade group Themed Entertainment Association.",5292013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-disneyland-explosion/update-2-disneyland-employee-arrested-in-suspected-dry-ice-explosion-idUSL2N0EA1J720130529

447,DIS,"DirecTV, two others bid over $1 billion for Hulu: source","(Reuters) - Satellite operator DirecTV and two other bidders have offered more than $1 billion apiece to buy Hulu, a source with knowledge of the bidding process said on Friday, increasing the likelihood that owners News Corp and Walt Disney Co will be able to shed the video streaming service they failed to sell in 2011. Hulu board members, who are being advised by Guggenheim Partners on the auction, fielded at least seven buyout offers last week, the source said. That number will be whittled down in the next two or three weeks, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the process was private. It was unclear which two other bidders offered $1 billion for Hulu. The service has more than 4 million subscribers and generates revenue of about $700 million through subscriptions and a free ad-supported service. The proposed price tag heightens the likelihood that News Corp and Disney will find an acceptable offer price, which was the sticking point of the 2011 round of buyout negotiations. DirecTV spokesman Darris Gringeri declined to comment, as did Meredith Kendall, a spokeswoman for Hulu. Bloomberg first reported the news on Friday. Sources have said the other bidders are Yahoo, former News Corp president Peter Chernin, private equity firm KKR, cable operator Time Warner Cable, Guggenheim Digital, and Silver Lake Management and talent agency William Morris Endeavor Entertainment in a joint bid. Cable company Comcast is the third owner of Hulu alongside News Corp and Disney, but is precluded from an operational role as a condition imposed on it upon its acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011.

448,DIS,Analysis: Disney goes to Infinity to turn around gaming unit,"(Reuters) - When Walt Disney Co introduced its latest video game, Infinity, to the gaming faithful this week at the annual E3 gaming conference, it rented a Los Angeles movie theater to show 30-minute clips of upcoming films and hosted a party with the glitz it usually reserves for its blockbuster movie wannabes. It shows just how much the company is counting on Infinity - whose players can for the first time mix together characters from Disney’s different franchises - to help turn around one part of the media giant that stubbornly refuses to turn a profit. Since it was created in 2008, Disney’s interactive division, which houses its video game and online properties, has chalked up losses in 13 of its 14 quarters, compiling $1.1 billion in total operating losses in that time. The division will likely not turn a profit this fiscal year ending September 30 as a result of the company delaying Infinity by two months, Disney CEO Bob Iger told analysts on an earnings call in May. “We believe in Infinity,” Iger said during the call. “We think it will be a great product and it’s going to drive profitability.” It took more than three years and around 200 people to create Infinity, according to John Blackburn, who heads Avalanche Software, the Disney-owned studio that created the game. Disney would not say how much it spent to create the game, which is scheduled for release on August 18. In the game, players can pit characters from Disney or Pixar movies against each other, such as a race between the super-charged racecar Lighting McQueen from “Cars” and quick-footed 10-year old superhero Dash from “The Incredibles.” It is Disney’s answer to Activision Blizzard’s Skylanders games, which lets players collect action figures that they can send on virtual action-adventure quests in a magical world called Skylands. The game was one of 2012’s top-selling games with more than $1 billion worldwide in retail sales. The launch will test Disney’s vaunted marketing troops, who can crank out hit movies and flashy theme park rides but have yet to work their magic to create many gaming hits. One reason is that most of its characters are more popular with girls than boys, who make up the majority of game players. Disney also invested heavily in console games, only to see sales of traditional boxed games decline and consumers flock instead to games played on cell phones or social networks like Facebook. To revamp the interactive unit, Iger in 2010 tapped former Yahoo Inc executive James Pitaro and John Pleasants, head of the social games maker Playdom that Disney had acquired for $563 million, as co-presidents. Pitaro and Pleasants cut costs through layoffs, redesigned the Disney.com website, and encouraged their creators to develop new characters. They had a minor hit with an alligator named Swampy that stars in the mobile game “Where’s My Water?” that has been downloaded more than 200 million times. Pleasants jettisoned many of the console projects. He told the interactive team that a narrow focus on two to three core titles would be better than working on 75 or more titles, according to Blackburn. “We have really tipped the scales in a very different way,” Pleasants said in an interview, “trying to get our development dollars and our energy focused on where the river is running fastest and where the growth is.” The unit’s losses narrowed to $54 million last quarter, about half of where they were when Pleasants and Pitaro started. Industry experts mostly approve of Disney’s strategy. Targeting the company’s mainstay market of 6- to 12-year-olds allows it to take advantage of the built-in fan base for its characters and to promote them with its movies, TV shows and theme park rides. Disney will release two movies from which it gets game characters - “Monsters University” on June 21 and “The Lone Ranger” on July 3 - in the months before the Infinity launch. It does, though, need to fend off Activision, the dominant force in the same video game world in which Infinity hopes to compete. “You never want to discount the ability of Disney to sell stuff branded with their characters,” said Cowen & Co analyst Doug Creutz, “but I do think it will be an uphill climb.” ",6112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-disney-infinity-analysi/analysis-disney-goes-to-infinity-to-turn-around-gaming-unit-idUSBRE95A0FE20130611
449,DIS,UPDATE 2-Disney's ESPN to close U.S. 3D cable TV network this year,"* Network cites low demand for 3D services in the home * ESPN 3D to close by year end * ESPN to invest in ultra HD sports programming By Lisa Richwine and Liana B. Baker June 12 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s TV sports network, ESPN, said it will shut its 3D cable channel in the United States, ending a three-year experiment after sports fans failed to embrace the technology in their homes. ESPN launched the 3D cable channel in 2010 and will close the channel by the end of the year, said ESPN spokeswoman Katina Arnold. It presented 3D broadcasts of college football games and the Masters golf tournament, among other offerings. Despite declining costs for 3D televisions and widespread use of 3D in movies, consumers have not rushed to bring the technology into their homes. ESPN 3D was commanding monthly fees on average of $2.79 per subscriber from cable and satellite operators this year, among the highest for a cable channel, according to research firm SNL Kagan. Pay TV providers also pay $5.54 on average for the flagship ESPN network. The network was carried by major operators such as DirecTV , Time Warner Cable Inc and Comcast Corp  in various programming packages. “They were just too early,” SNL Kagan analyst Derek Baine said. “This technology is not ready for prime time.” ESPN will continue to experiment with other technologies including Ultra High Definition, or ultra HD, for its programming on ESPN and its sister channels, Arnold said. “We are committing our 3D resources to other products and services that will better serve fans and affiliates,” she said. The network could return to 3D programming “if or when 3D does take off,” she added. ESPN, the dominant U.S. sports network and a major driver of Disney’s earnings, operates its flagship ESPN channel and others, including ESPN2 and Spanish language ESPN Deportes.

451,DIS,Funds betting on the growing amusement park market,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - It’s the one place where a roller coaster ride is a good thing. Revenue at U.S. theme parks is expected to reach a record $13.4 billion this year, a 2.8 percent gain from 2012, according to market research firm IBIS World. The expanding U.S. economy, improving housing market and declining unemployment rate are all factors behind the rosy forecast. Rising demand was one reason that Walt Disney Co was able to raise its U.S. ticket prices 9.6 percent last week, putting a one-day pass to Disneyland at $92. Comcast Corp’s Universal Studios, meanwhile, invested more than $155 million in theme parks last year to take market share from Disney. The company plans to build a Harry Potter attraction at its Hollywood park, further cutting into Disney’s core market. While theme parks make up just one division at both Disney and Comcast, analysts say both companies are in the best positions to capture the expected growth in the sector.

453,DIS,Analysis: Raising prices easier said than done for U.S. companies,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co last week hiked single-day admission prices at its U.S. theme parks by up to 9.6 percent, the fifth increase since 2009. But other U.S. companies might want to think twice before following suit. Just ask Kohl’s Corp. The department store chain raised prices two years ago only to see shoppers take their business elsewhere. It has been struggling to make up lost ground ever since and recently said it would ramp up advertising to lure customers back. While U.S. growth has quickened slightly this year, most Americans are still pinching pennies, aggregate consumer spending is less than 5 percent above pre-recession levels, and companies that try to raise prices risk the wrath of their customers. If the spotty sales performance of major retailers like Wal-Mart and Nordstrom is any guide, regaining a measure of pricing power is a distant dream for most U.S. companies. “One of the early behaviors that we saw in the downturn was consumers trading down from higher- to lower-priced products. You saw it in everything from soap to beer,” said David Axson, a managing director at global consulting firm Accenture. “Consumer behavior, once it changes, takes a long time to change again.” It’s been slow to change because even now, four years since the end of the recession, the U.S. economy is far from healed. Massive job losses have ended, but the jobless rate remains at 7.6 percent and that doesn’t include many Americans who have left the labor force because they couldn’t find a job. And those with jobs earn fractionally less now on average than in late 2008, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Typically, at this point we’d be much farther along, but recovering from a financial-led recession takes anywhere from seven to 10 years, and we’re still a ways away,” said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo. In fact, fallout from the 2007-2009 recession - the deepest since the Great Depression - has left companies nearly as shell-shocked as consumers, said Georg Tacke, co-CEO of Simon-Kucher & Partners, a global consulting firm based in Bonn, Germany. Under pressure to maintain profit margins, firms have focused on cutting costs to the bone and hoarding cash rather than using it to hire workers or invest. But there’s a limit to how lean companies can get. “At some point, they have to act on prices, and many have forgotten how to do it, and more importantly, have not educated their customers to expect it,” Tacke said, adding that could hurt bottom lines once growth and inflation start rising. For now things look set to get worse before they get better. Most economists expect the U.S. economy, facing government belt-tightening and higher taxes, to slow from the 2.4 percent growth rate it logged in the first quarter. That’s helped keep price pressures throughout the economy in check. Consumer prices rose just 1.1 percent in the year to April. When stripped of food and energy costs, they were up 1.7 percent, the smallest rise in nearly two years. Against such a backdrop, “only companies that offer differentiation, whether it’s the product or a service, have any pricing power,” said Joel Bines, managing director of consulting firm AlixPartners. Disney could hike prices by much more than the inflation rate because of its unique offering - an experience customers can’t easily match elsewhere. Others have relied on innovative product development to keep up profits. While Apple Inc has not raised prices, it has managed to get customers to keep buying its relatively expensive iPads and iPhones by rolling out frequent product upgrades. But companies that cater to middle-income consumers, like Kohl’s, or offer goods and services that are largely interchangeable with those sold elsewhere, are more constrained. “If you’re talking about the Wal-Marts of the world, the supermarkets and big box stores, it’s fair to say they have relatively little pricing power,” Axson said. The most recent season of corporate earnings proved how cautious consumers are. Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s U.S. same store sales fell last quarter and department store group Nordstrom Inc lowered its sales forecast. Purveyors of luxury goods such as watches and jewelry, or high-end hotels, whose wealthy customers weathered the recession well, are better placed to raise prices. A rising stock market and recovering home prices have been a big help. Tiffany & Co implemented price increases in early 2013, in part to contend with higher diamond prices, but that did not prevent it from selling more high-end jewelry. But even at high-end chains, there is a limit to pricing power. Sales of less expensive jewelry at Tiffany have sagged. Luxury department store chain Saks Inc, which has been trying to wean customers off of promotions since the financial crisis eased, offered bigger discounts at a sale in April than a year earlier. There are still industries where demand exceeds supply, and that has already helped some companies regain pricing power. Consolidation in the airline industry has put an end to the days of fierce price wars between carriers, with average fares up about 8 percent between 2008 and 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. U.S. automakers helped themselves by slowing production in recent years after building too many cars between 2000 and 2009, said Eric Lyman, vice president at ALG, a consultant to the auto industry. Average transaction prices for vehicles have since climbed above $31,000 from $28,050 in 2008, according to Edmunds.com. For other industries, it’s going to take faster overall growth before things improve. Some economists expect the economy to gain momentum in second half of the year and in 2014. But it will take time for hiring to catch up and even longer for the type of wage gains seen in the boom years of the late 1990s. In 1997, average weekly earnings were rising by as much as 3.7 percent year-on-year; in April, the equivalent was 0.9 percent. “People have adapted to a different way of buying things and different types of products,” said Axson. “It’s going to be very interesting these next two or three years to see if companies can convince consumers to open their wallets a little wider.” ",6122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-companies-pricingpower-analysis/analysis-raising-prices-easier-said-than-done-for-u-s-companies-idUSBRE95B05C20130612
454,DIS,"Crystal, Goodman head back to school in 'Monsters University'","LOS ANGELES, June 18 (Reuters) - One-eyed green monster Mike Wazowski and his giant blue, furry friend James P. “Sully” Sullivan go back in time as “scaring” students in “Monsters University,” as Walt Disney Co.’s Pixar Animation Studios pins its hopes for a blockbuster on the coming-of-age story. “Monsters University,” a prequel to 2001 animated film “Monsters, Inc.,” will be released on Friday in U.S. theaters, and director Dan Scanlon told Reuters one of the main challenges was to keep the film fresh and surprising for audiences. “You’re dealing with the fact that everybody knows how the movie is going to end,” Scanlon said about plotting Pixar’s first prequel, particularly for a film that grossed more than $560 million at the worldwide box office. A college setting seemed ideal for best friends Mike, voiced by Billy Crystal, and Sully, voiced by John Goodman, Scanlon said, to “explore serious emotional relationship stuff” and “major self-discovery.” “It’s a maturing process or learning who you are,” Goodman added. “Everybody goes through it, whether you went to college or not.” “Monsters University” tells the story of how Mike and Sully first met in college as “scaring” majors, learning the prestigious art of scaring human beings in order to harness their screams, which power the city of Monstropolis. Although Mike and Sully eventually become friends and co-workers at scaring factory Monsters, Inc., their friendship does not have the smoothest start, with Sully’s “party-guy” popularity conflicting with the studious, ambitious Mike. The film focuses on Mike, whose sole ambition from childhood is to become a “scarer” despite not being very intimidating, and at university, he struggles to find his place among his peers, finally fitting in with a fraternity of outcasts. “Unfortunately, he lacks a certain undefinable quality to be scary. So now he has to find what it is that makes him special,” said Scanlon. “What we see as crushing failures in life hopefully lead us to new things - things we never thought possible.” “Monsters University” producer Kori Rae, who worked closely with Crystal and Goodman on the first film, said she noticed the veteran actors were much more comfortable in their monster skins, and have fun playing their characters as teenagers. “They got to dig in and explore who these guys were back then,” noted Rae. Crystal, 65, and Goodman, 60, said they saw a lot of themselves in teenage Mike and Sully. Crystal likened Mike’s need to have someone to catch him when he flies off the handle to times when he himself needed  “someone as grounded as John” when he went off script to improvise. He also empathized with Mike’s ambition, comparing it to his own. “Mike never stops working to get better and he doesn’t let anything get in his way. He many not like how he stacks up with everybody else, but he’ll work you in to the ground - and I’ve always had that kind of drive,” the comedian said. For Goodman, Sully’s easy-going likeability was an instant draw. “(Sully’s) a guy who gets to do what he loves for a living. There ain’t’ enough of that to go around,” Goodman said. Both men are also open to reprising their roles for a third installment, should one ever come to pass. In fact, Crystal already has ideas. “Monsters Assisted Living,” he said, before altering his voice to channel an elderly Mike. “Do my ankles look swollen to you?”",6182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/film-monstersuniversity/crystal-goodman-head-back-to-school-in-monsters-university-idUSL2N0ET11O20130618
455,DIS,REUTERS SUMMIT-Yahoo's Mayer shines spotlight on video,"(For other news from Reuters Global Technology Summit, click on  www.reuters.com/summit/Tech13) By Alexei Oreskovic SAN FRANCISCO, June 20 (Reuters) - As Marissa Mayer approaches her one-year anniversary as chief executive of Yahoo, she’s hewing closely to the struggling Web portal’s traditional advertising model—and eyeing more video programming of every stripe as central to the strategy. “We’re working on various methods in terms of how we can increase our video views, and watching,” Mayer said at the Reuters Global Technology Summit on Thursday. “It’s clear to me that our video business is something that’s growing a lot. It’s something that we’d like to accelerate.” Yahoo is currently bidding to acquire Hulu, the online hub for TV programming owned by Walt Disney Co and News Corp , sources with knowledge of the situation have told Reuters. Mayer would not comment on the bid for Hulu. The Web pioneer was looking at buying French video site DailyMotion but had to abandon the effort after objections from the French government. Yahoo also has a growing menu of original video programming, such as the critically-acclaimed Burning Love TV reality show spoof, and it recently acquired the rights to the archive of Saturday Night Live television programs. Online video commands higher ad rates than other types of Web content and has become a fiercely competitive arena as it is increasingly viewed as a bulwark against the steady decline in prices for online display ads. On Thursday, Instagram, the mobile photo-sharing app owned by Facebook Inc, introduced a new feature that allows users to create 15-second videos. Facebook itself is reported to be readying an online video ad format. Google Inc’s  YouTube, the world’s No.1 online video destination, is expected to generate $5 billion in revenue this year, according to RBC Capital Markets. Mayer took the top job at Yahoo after a tumultuous period in which the company had churned through several CEOs and many of its top executives and engineers jumped ship. She has revamped key products such as mail and the Yahoo home page, implemented morale-boosting measures like free food, and jumpstarted acquisitions. On Thursday, Yahoo closed its $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr, a blogging service that is one of the Web’s most popular hubs of user-generated content. Yahoo’s stock has surged roughly 70 percent since Mayer became CEO. But Wall Street analysts say much of the gain has come from stock buybacks and from Yahoo’s Asian assets, including a 24 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce giant and potential IPO debutante Alibaba Group. Yahoo’s biggest near-term goal and most important yardstick by which to measure its progress will be the rate of increase in the amount of time users spend on its websites, Mayer said. “Yahoo’s ability to generate revenue for a thousand pages is reasonably good,” Mayer said. “The challenge for Yahoo at the moment is traffic. How do we grow traffic? How do we gain usage? Because that ultimately will drive up revenue.” While rivals such as Google have experimented with new revenue streams, including subscription music services and online retailing, Mayer said Yahoo remains squarely focused on advertising. “I believe in ads, I like ads. We may try some other things but Yahoo is an ad company,” Mayer said, but added that it does not mean Yahoo will cut on its own original programming. The company’s headcount has decreased by about 1,000 employees during her first year, through a combination of attrition and ramped-up performance management, with staffers now getting reviewed on a quarterly basis instead of every year, she said. But Mayer said the company was aggressively pursuing new talent: job applications recently peaked at 10,000 a week, more than twice the level of a year ago. At the same time, Mayer has moved to cut back the thickets of bureaucracy that she said had sprouted across the company over its 18-year history. Mayer installed a system called PB&J;, short for Process, Bureaucracy and Jams. That has eliminated roughly 700 irksome or unnecessary procedures within the company, such as forcing employees to undergo a special orientation for the company gym. “I understand that we are geeks and we may not be that coordinated but I think we can all figure out how to use a treadmill without an orientation,” Mayer said. Some industry-watchers assumed the PB&J; moniker was an homage to the so-called “peanut butter manifesto,” in which former Yahoo executives warned of problems plaguing the company. Mayer said the real story was much simpler. “Most days for lunch I have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,” she explained. “So sitting there I was like ‘Can we call it something simple and fun like PB&J;?’ And we kind of backed into process, bureaucracy and jams. But it works.” Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits   (Additional reporting by Poornima Gupta and Edwin Chan.

457,DIS,UPDATE 1-Disney's 'Lone Ranger' starts box office ride with $2 mln,"By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, July 3 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s  big-budget Western “The Lone Ranger,” starring Johnny Depp as Native American sidekick Tonto, rode off with $2 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales during its first shows on Tuesday night, trotting well behind animated “Despicable Me 2.” Both films are fighting for audiences heading into the U.S. Independence Day holiday on Thursday, one of the biggest movie going periods of the year. “Despicable Me 2” took in $4.7 million in its Tuesday night preview shows, according to distributor Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast Corp . The animated movie, featuring the voice of Steve Carell, is expected to rule the box office through Sunday, with domestic ticket sales of more than $110 million, industry forecasters said. “The Lone Ranger” is projected to capture $60 million to $70 million during the same period. With Tuesday night sales, “both films are solid enough to make the projected numbers, pretty much on the money,” said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com’s box office division. “The Lone Ranger” would ultimately generate $180 million in domestic ticket sales, according to Tony Wible, managing director of Janney Montgomery Scott, who follows Disney. He estimated that at those levels, the movie would generate $370 million for Disney in revenues from foreign, video and other sales. That total would give Disney a modest profit, based on estimated production costs of $225 million and more than $100 million for marketing. Wible’s numbers don’t include merchandise sales, he said. The film is the latest entry in Disney’s strategy of spending more on fewer films and trying to build franchises that can generate continued revenues from sequels, merchandise and outlets like its theme parks and TV properties. The company found such success with Marvel superhero films “The Avengers” and “Iron Man 3,” but wrote down $200 million when sci-fi epic “John Carter” flopped last year. “The Lone Ranger” is an action remake of a 1930s radio show and television series in the 1950s. Armie Hammer plays John Reid, the lawman who dons a mask to fight injustice in the Old West. Critics have not embraced the movie. Among 110 reviews compiled on the Rotten Tomatoes website on Wednesday, just 25 percent recommended the film. Big-budget Westerns have failed to grab mass audiences, which could hurt “The Lone Ranger,” said Jeff Bock, box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. But, he added, that pirate movies were also a tough sell in Hollywood before Depp made “Pirates of Caribbean” a global hit. “I don’t think that many people remember ‘The Lone Ranger,’” Bock said, “But they know Johnny Depp. He connects with audiences.”",7032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-loneranger/update-1-disneys-lone-ranger-starts-box-office-ride-with-2-mln-idUSL2N0F915A20130703
458,DIS,Disney's 'Lone Ranger' starts box office ride with $2 mln Tuesday,"LOS ANGELES, July 3 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s  big-budget Western reboot “The Lone Ranger” rode off with $2 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales during its first shows on Tuesday night, trotting behind animated “Despicable Me 2” with $4.7 million, according to studio estimates. Both films are fighting for audiences heading into Thursday’s U.S. Independence Day holiday, one of the biggest moviegoing periods of the year. “Despicable Me 2,” from Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures, is expected to rule the box office through Sunday with domestic ticket sales of more than $110 million, industry forecasters said. “The Lone Ranger” is projected to capture $60 million to $70 million during the same period. “The Lone Ranger” stars Johnny Depp as Native American sidekick Tonto in an action remake based on the classic radio and TV series. “Despicable Me 2” features the voice of Steve Carell in a sequel to a 2010 blockbuster.

461,DIS,Disney's 'Lone Ranger' off to a slow gallop at holiday box office,"July 5 (Reuters) - “The Lone Ranger,” Walt Disney Co’s  big-budget Western starring Johnny Depp, wrangled just $19.5 million in ticket sales in its first two full days at U.S. and Canadian movie theaters, trailing far behind the $59.5 million racked up by animated sequel “Despicable Me 2.” The tally for “Lone Ranger,” which included receipts starting on Tuesday night through Thursday’s U.S. Independence Day holiday, put the film on pace to miss, by a long haul, industry forecasts for the holiday period. The film about the masked man who fights injustice was likely to finish with about $45 million at domestic theaters through Sunday, Disney said. That was far below the $60 million to $70 million predicted ahead of the film’s opening. “If it does end up grossing less than $50 million” by Sunday, “it will most certainly go down as a misfire,” said Jeff Bock, a senior analyst for Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie box office prospects. Disney spent an estimated $225 million to make “Lone Ranger” and more than $100 million to market the film, an action remake of a 1930s radio show and a 1950s TV series. Armie Hammer plays the masked man who fights injustice with help from Tonto, his Native American companion played by Depp. The film’s poor opening is a black eye for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski and Depp, the trio behind Disney’s ultra-successful “Pirates of the Caribbean” series. “Despicable Me 2,” produced for $76 million, pulled in family audiences to dominate ticket sales over one of the year’s biggest movie-going periods, the days around the July Fourth holiday. The film also started screening on Tuesday night, with Wednesday its first full day in theaters. The film from Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures features the voice of Steve Carell, reprising his role as Gru from the 2010 blockbuster “Despicable Me.” The sequel gave Universal its biggest Wednesday opening ever and was the third-highest opening day for any animated film.

462,DIS,Philips teams with Disney on lighting for kids,"AMSTERDAM, July 9 (Reuters) - Philips aims to offset weakness in street and home lighting systems by partnering with Walt Disney Co to sell Mickey and Minnie Mouse night lamps for children. The world’s biggest lighting maker is feeling the impact of fragile consumer demand, weak construction markets and government budget cuts in Europe which have translated into lower demand. Neither company disclosed financial details at the product launch but they demonstrated a child’s bedroom where the typical  overhead lamp was replaced by multiple coloured lights and imitation candles, including under the bed. The lights are either decorated with or in the shape of various Disney characters. Last year, Philips launched “hue”, a home lighting system  controlled via a smartphone app and sold through Apple’s stores, as it tries to reinvent its range of consumer lighting products and spur demand for LED bulbs which last several years. Philips’ earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) at its lighting division more than halved last year to 188 million euros on sales of 8.44 billion euros. Philips and Disney said the new children’s lights would go on sale in Europe and the United States from September, followed by Asia and Canada later in the year.",7092013,http://www.reuters.com/article/philips-disney-lights/philips-teams-with-disney-on-lighting-for-kids-idUSL6N0FF33120130709

470,DIS,Marvel's 'Agents' hope to entice Comic-Con fans to lagging ABC,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney offered Marvel comic devotees an exclusive look at its new television series “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D” on Friday as its ABC network hopes to engage the “super fans” at Comic-Con to bounce back from a ratings decline. Banking on the huge success of Marvel’s films that include 2012’s “Avengers,” ABC and Disney’s television series tries to lure young fans of the films to a new platform for the universe created by the comic books. They had their first shot at San Diego’s annual comic convention, which has become a venue for television studios to bring fans their favorite shows, building hype around upcoming seasons. Unlike the films that focus on superheroes such as Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D” side-steps costumed crime-fighters to center on Agent Phil Coulson, a high-level government official who commands Marvel’s Supreme Headquarters, International Espionage, Law-Enforcement Division. The series’ executive producer, Joss Whedon, creator of sci-fi TV series “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and director of Disney’s Marvel box office hit films “Thor” and “Avengers,” said on Friday that the show would take a more human focus. “‘The Avengers’ is the epicenter of the Marvel universe and this is the periphery, this is about the people who did not get the big hammer or gamma radiation, and are dealing with things on a human scale,” Whedon told reporters. For ABC, which has suffered a ratings decline that put it last of the four largest TV networks among the young audience coveted by advertisers, Comic-Con is a quick way to tap into Marvel’s devoted fan base. Last year’s “The Avengers” had the largest box office opening at the North American box office, while this year’s “Iron Man 3” grossed more than $400 million at domestic theaters. Not much is known about “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D” but on Friday, fans were given an exclusive look at the first episode of the television series, set to air on September 24. Coulson, played by Clark Gregg, has had supporting roles in the “Iron Man,” “Thor” and “Avengers” films, where he quickly became a hit with his humorous and often sarcastic one-liners. “‘The Avengers’ made him a fan favorite, he was the audience surrogate in the movies ... and the way Clark brings him to life, people love that,” said Jeff Bell, the show’s co-writer and producer. In “Avengers,” Coulson was seemingly killed off, but in the trailer for the new television show, the agent is very much alive and the mystery behind his death is resolved. Another network on high display on Friday was HBO, which brings its raunchy vampire series “True Blood” and medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones” to San Diego each year, and both attract a slew of fans. “Game of Thrones” devotees dressed as their favorite character from the show to attend the panel featuring cast and crew, who discussed the past season. HBO is also hosting fan interactive experiences, parties with the cast. It even debuted a new beer in honor of the show. “Comic-Con over the past few years has seen such a growth in terms of size and scale of what’s going on, there’s a lot more noise and clutter, and we’re always looking for ways to stand out in the market there,” said Zach Enterlin, HBO’s senior vice president of program advertising. “The fans that come to San Diego are almost super fans, and the most dialed-in and most engaged and most passionate,” he added.

474,DIS,"UPDATE 3-'Arrested' bump disappoints Netflix investors, shares drop","(Rewrites lead; adds comments from Netflix executives, updates share price) By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, July 22 (Reuters) - Quirky comedy “Arrested Development” lured new subscribers to  Netflix Inc’s  streaming service in the second quarter, but not enough to impress investors who sent its shares tumbling 4 percent in after-hours trading on Monday. “Arrested Development,” which Netflix dusted off seven years after it last ran on Fox, generated “a small but noticeable bump in membership,” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Chief Financial  Officer David Wells said in a letter to shareholders. Netflix said it added 630,000 streaming customers in the United States, hitting the middle of a forecast the company issued in April. Wall Street analysts were unimpressed after the market sent the company’s share price up 183 percent this year, the biggest gainer on the S&P; 500 index, in reaction to buzz about shows such as “Arrested Development” and “House of Cards.” On Monday, shares of Netflix fell 4 percent in after-hours trading to $251.50, down from their earlier $261.96 close on the Nasdaq. “It was a good quarter, but not good enough,” said Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia. “The stock had run up too much, too quickly.” Wall Street analysts on average expected Netflix to add 700,000 new customers to the U.S. streaming service, the largest part of its business, Bhatia said. Netflix beat analysts’ forecasts with $29 million in profit, or 49 cents per share, and up from $6 million a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 40 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Reveue for the quarter was $1.07 billion, up 20 percent from $889 million a year earlier. The company shook up Hollywood last week with 14 Emmy nominations for original series including “Arrested Development” and political thriller “House of Cards,” the first Internet series to nab Emmy nods in major categories. The shows are part of a push into original content that Netflix hopes will bring in new subscribers. Hastings said the company was pleased with the response to its original programming. “The strategy is just beginning,” he said in an interview. “The payoff is continued rapid membership growth. If we can continue our rapid membership growth, we’ll feel very pleased.” The original shows are grabbing “TV-sized audiences,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a video webcast with executives, an unusual format that replaced the traditional quarterly conference call. The company declined to provide viewership figures for the shows. Netflix, in its shareholder letter, forecast it will add up to 1.5 million U.S. streaming customers in the current quarter. That guidance “looks like a little light,” Gabelli & Co analyst Brett Harriss said. “Netflix needs to add a substantial amount of subscribers to justify the current valuation.” The company reported 29.8 million U.S. streaming customers at the end of June, and 7.8 million international streaming customers. Netflix is working to add subscribers to pay the cost of movies and TV shows from Hollywood studios, its original shows, and a push into foreign territories. At the same time, it is facing competition from online players such as Amazon.com Inc  and Hulu, which is getting a cash infusion of $750 million from owners Walt Disney Co, 21st Century Fox  and Comcast Corp. “Now that Hulu has more money to spend, content prices may rise further,” Hastings and Wells said in their letter. “But we have many multi-year deals in place to mitigate this.”     (Additionals reporting by Liana B.

475,DIS,"UPDATE 1-Time Warner Cable, Hulu break off talks-sources","By Ronald Grover LOS ANGELES, July 24 (Reuters) - The owners of video streaming site Hulu called off talks with Time Warner Cable Inc  over the cable operator’s plan to take a 25 percent stake after failing to agree on a price, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations. Hulu’s owners - Walt Disney Co, 21st Century Fox  and NBC owner Comcast Corp - began talks with Time Warner Cable in early July when they failed to attract satisfactory bids in an auction of the service. The talks may resume, but none are planned for now, according to one source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. Hulu and Fox declined to comment. Time Warner Cable and Disney did not immediately return calls seeking comment. The reported end of the latest round of discussions marks another blow for Hulu and its media conglomerate owners, which last shopped the five-year-old video service unsuccessfully in 2011.

A deal would reunite Weinstein brothers - Harvey and Bob - with Miramax, a company they founded and later sold to Walt Disney Co, which owned Miramax Films until 2010. Quoting an unnamed source, the paper said talks began several weeks ago with a meeting between Weinstein Co Chief Executive Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Chairman Tom Barrack. Barrack confirmed the meeting in an email to the paper, but declined to confirm a potential merger. News of the merger talks was first reported by Variety. The Weinstein brothers left Miramax in 2005 after a contentious relationship with Disney and that year founded the Weinstein Company, best known for its low-budget, critically acclaimed movies, such as Oscar-winner “The King’s Speech” in 2010.

479,DIS,'Shrek' studio Dreamworks remakes itself with a flurry of deals,"LOS ANGELES, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc , the studio that built one of Hollywood’s largest film franchises on the back of a green ogre named Shrek, has suddenly become one of the entertainment industry’s busiest dealmakers. In the last year, Dreamworks has bought a YouTube network aimed at teenagers and picked up a company that controls such iconic characters as Lassie and Casper the Friendly Ghost. It acquired the rights to the Troll toy franchise and in June, signed a deal to produce a TV series for streaming video service Netflix Inc. It also plans to build a $3 billion entertainment complex with partners in China. And Dreamworks isn’t finished. “There will definitely be more deals,” Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg said in an interview. “I have never seen more opportunities to build our brand in our 19 years in business.” Katzenberg will not say what else is on his list, or whether he prefers to buy or partner with other companies. One thing still percolating, he says, is a Dreamworks cable channel, “but there’s nothing out there right now for us.” A few years back, Dreamworks considered selling itself to a larger media company in hopes of converting its cable channel to one featuring Dreamworks movies or TV shows, according to news reports at the time. Dreamworks’ acquisition spree comes at a time when the animated film market has become so saturated with studio-backed fare that the studio’s most recent entry, “Turbo,” debuted with two other animated films already in the market. “Turbo” ended up with lackluster ticket sales of $21 million in the United States and Canada during its first weekend. Earlier this year, Dreamworks took an $87 million write down for its holiday-themed “Rise of the Guardians,” and another $54 million charge to rework “Me & My Shadow.” Dreamworks hopes acquisitions can help expand its popular franchises, such as “Shrek” and “Kung Fu Panda,” beyond the big screen to television, toys and even theme parks. It is a formula that helped turn Walt Disney Co into the largest media conglomerate, with a market value of $118 billion. Dreamworks is tiny in comparison, with a market value of about $2.3 billion. Investors have welcomed Katzenberg’s diversification strategy, sending Dreamworks shares up 50 percent in the past year. As a result of dealmaking, analyst Tony Wible of Janney Montgomery Scott predicts about 45 percent of Dreamworks’ revenue this year will come from non-movie making, including TV shows produced by Classic Media, which Dreamworks bought last summer for $157.6 million. Classic Media owns the rights to animated characters Richie Rich, Dick Tracy, and George of the Jungle, among others. A year ago, Wible said, Dreamworks was getting only about 15 percent of revenue from areas other than newly released films, with most of that coming from DVD sales of older movies. This year, Dreamworks expects to bring in $100 million in revenue from its television ventures. The estimate does not include revenue from AwesomenessTV, the teen-oriented YouTube network Dreamworks acquired in May. Over the next five years, Dreamworks says it will produce 1,200 hours of programs for companies such as Netflix and German kids channel Super RTL, including those inspired from “Turbo” and “How to Train Your Dragon.” Dreamworks also will market merchandise from the Troll toy franchise after buying the rights to the line in April. In July, a Dreamworks attraction with a Disney-style character-parade and other entertainment opened at the Sands Cotai Central casino, owned by Sands China Ltd, in Macau. Dreamworks also is expanding in China, and is working with partners through a joint venture called Oriental Dreamworks to build a $3.1 billion entertainment district that will open in Shanghai in 2016. In addition, the venture will produce live-action movies and animated films for Chinese audiences. But Katzenberg, who headed Disney’s movie studio for a decade until 1994, denies the flurry of deals is a bid to recreate a modern day version of the media giant’s far flung entertainment empire. “Times have changed, this is totally different,” he said. “The thing we had in common were a great brand, some great content and a lot of opportunities to expand.”",8042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/dreamworks-deals/shrek-studio-dreamworks-remakes-itself-with-a-flurry-of-deals-idUSL1N0G203T20130804
480,DIS,Disney projects up to $190 million 'Lone Ranger' loss,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co expects to lose between $160 million and $190 million on its expensive summer movie bomb “The Lone Ranger,” the media giant said on Tuesday as it reported a small gain in quarterly profit that beat Wall Street forecasts. The loss for “The Lone Ranger,” a Western starring Johnny Depp, will be recorded for the quarter that ends in September, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a conference call with analysts. Disney shares dropped 1.9 percent in after-hours trading to $65.79 from a $67.05 close on the New York Stock Exchange. “Lone Ranger” opened July 3 with a dismal $29 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales over its first weekend. “There has been a lot said, I know, about the risk of basically high cost, tent pole films,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said, “and we certainly can attest to that given what happened with Lone Ranger.” “We still think the tentpole strategy is a good strategy,” he said. “That one way to rise above the din and the competition is with a big film, not just big budget, but big story, big cast, big marketing behind it.” For the quarter that ended in June, operating income at Disney’s film studio declined 36 percent as hit film “Iron Man 3” failed to match the spectacular success of last year’s “The Avengers.” Overall, net income for the quarter rose 1 percent to $1.85 billion. Adjusted earnings-per-share reached $1.03, beating the $1.01 average forecast from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating income increased at the company’s theme parks and its media networks division, which operates sports channel ESPN. “Overall it was a decent quarter, but nothing to get excited about,” Wunderlich Securities analyst Matt Harrigan said. A gain in fees and advertising revenue at ESPN helped lift operating income at Disney’s media networks by 8 percent to $2.3 billion for the quarter. At the parks unit, operating income increased 9 percent to $689 million as more people visited Disney’s theme parks in Florida and California. The interactive gaming unit posted a loss of $58 million. The company is counting on the August 18 release of its Infinity game to turn the unit profitable.

483,DIS,US STOCKS-Wall St finishes lower on uncertainty about Fed's move,"* Lockhart, Evans latest Fed officials to mention Sept. tapering * IBM, Dow’s biggest decliner, drops after Credit Suisse downgrade * Walt Disney Co shares fall 1 pct in after-hours trading * Dow off 0.6 pct, S&P; 500 down 0.6 pct, Nasdaq down 0.7 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid for a second consecutive day on Tuesday after comments from a pair of U.S. Federal Reserve officials left investors uncertain about the timing of a possible reduction in its bond-buying program. Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, told Market News International in an interview that the Fed could begin trimming the size of the stimulus program as soon as September, but might wait longer if the expected economic growth in the year’s second half fails to materialize. Later in the session, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans echoed the sentiment when he said the central bank will probably decrease the program later this year and could do so as early as next month, depending on the economic data. Fed officials “are all hedging themselves, which is why the market continues to just be a little bit confused and why it is going to churn,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “There is really no reason at the moment for the market to go higher because it is still too unclear.” One catalyst for Monday’s downturn in the Dow and the S&P; 500 was provided by Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. He said he supported scaling back the central bank’s stimulus next month unless economic data takes a turn for the worse. The S&P; 500’s decline on Tuesday was its biggest fall since June 24 as investors continued to take profits from the recent rally that drove the Dow Jones industrial average and the benchmark S&P; to back-to-back record closing highs late last week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 93.39 points or 0.60 percent, to end at 15,518.74. The S&P; 500 declined 9.77 points or 0.57 percent, to 1,697.37. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 27.182 points or 0.74 percent, to 3,665.77. Earlier, the Dow fell as low as 15,473.40, while the S&P; 500 touched a session low of 1,693.29, and the Nasdaq hit an intraday low of 3,654.672. The S&P; 500 has risen for five of the past six weeks, gaining more than 7 percent over that period. Volume was light for the second straight day, with about 5.5 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE MKT and Nasdaq, below the daily average of 6.36 billion. The thin volume exaggerated the market’s swings. Monday marked the lowest volume for a full-day session so far this year. With major U.S. economic data like the nonfarm payrolls report and earnings from bellwethers out of the way, volume is expected to be light throughout the week. Walt Disney Co posted a slightly higher quarterly profit that beat Wall Street’s expectations, even though its movie studio earnings declined, in results released after the closing bell. Disney’s stock fell 1 percent to $66.35 in extended-hours trading. The stock ended regular trading at $67.05, up 1.6 percent. During the regular session, the biggest drag on the Dow was International Business Machines Corp. The stock dropped 2.3 percent to $190.99 after Credit Suisse cut its rating to “underperform” from “neutral,” saying growth would be a challenge for IBM in the future. Credit Suisse also cut its price target on the Dow component by $25 to $175. IBM topped the list of the Dow’s 10 worst-performing stocks. Bank of America shares declined 1.1 percent to close at $14.64 after the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil lawsuits against the bank for what government lawyers said was a fraud on investors involving $850 million of residential mortgage-backed securities. The stock was among the Dow’s 10 bottom performers. The S&P; financial index lost 0.9 percent. Retailers’ shares were among the day’s biggest losers. American Eagle Outfitters shares tumbled 12 percent to $17.57 a day after the retailer said its second-quarter profit would be hurt by weak sales and margins. A number of analysts downgraded the stock. The S&P; retail index slipped 0.4 percent. Of the 418 companies in the S&P; 500 that had reported earnings for the second quarter through Tuesday morning, Thomson Reuters data showed that 67.5 percent have topped analysts’ expectations, in line with the average beat over the past four quarters. On the revenue side, the data showed that 54 percent have reported revenue above estimates, more than in the past four quarters but below the historical average.

Even after the benchmark S&P; 500 index suffered its biggest decline since June 24 on Tuesday, the market was unable to bounce back following comments from a pair of Fed officials that gave little clarity to how soon the central bank might reduce its bond-buying program. The S&P; 500 broke below 1,694.06, its 14-day moving average, which had served as a support level. The broad market index is down 1.1 percent for the week, on track for the worst weekly performance since a drop of 2.1 percent during the week of June 21 after the Fed’s last policy meeting. However, the index is still up 18.6 percent this year after closing at a record high on Friday. “People were concerned about the extent of the rally in the short term, and some people are talking about equities being too expensive relative to the underlying fundamentals,” said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. “And of course, the big story, the next big piece of news, one would think, is the taper tantrum.” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Sandra Pianalto said on Wednesday that the central bank would be prepared to scale back asset purchases if the labor market remains on the stronger path followed since last fall.

The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 11.761 points or 0.32 percent, to 3,654.009. Volume was once again light, with about 5.49 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE MKT and Nasdaq, far below the daily average of 6.35 billion. Volume on Monday was the lowest of the year for a full trading session. Walt Disney Co was the Dow’s worst performer. The stock fell 1.7 percent to $65.91 a day after the company projected a massive loss on its film “The Lone Ranger.” Disney’s adjusted earnings slightly beat expectations. First Solar Inc shares plunged 13.4 percent to $40.47 a day after the solar panel manufacturer reported results that missed expectations and cut its full-year outlook. Ralph Lauren Corp shares fell 8.6 percent to $173.13 after the fashion retailer reported a lower profit and disappointing sales at its own stores. The two stocks were the S&P; 500’s worst performers. Equity markets have been closely tied to central bank policy, with many investors concerned that economic growth isn’t robust enough to boost stocks without the Fed’s help. Last week, the July payroll report was much weaker than expected. Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said on Tuesday that the Fed would probably scale back its bond-buying program later this year, perhaps beginning as early as next month, depending on economic data. That echoed comments made earlier on Tuesday by Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, though he told Market News International that the Fed might continue its stimulus program if growth doesn’t meet its targets.

Even after shares suffered their biggest decline since June 24 on Tuesday, the market was unable to shake off comments from a pair of Fed officials on Tuesday that muddied the water over how soon the central bank might reduce its bond-buying program. The S&P; 500 broke below 1,693.95 on Wednesday, its 14-day moving average that had been serving as a support level. “The risk reward is not as same as it used to be for the market. It used to be that people were anticipating economic recovery and knew the rates would stay low. Rates are more competitive now, and it takes real earnings growth to back stocks at these levels,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “With earnings almost over, we aren’t left with bellwether stock stories that prevent some level of profit-taking.” Walt Disney Co was the top decliner on the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average index. The stock fell 3 percent to $65.04 a day after projecting a massive loss related to its film, “The Lone Ranger,” though adjusted earnings slightly beat expectations. Time Warner Inc shares rose 2.6 percent to $66.65 after the company reported a bigger revenue than had been forecast. AOL Inc rose 2.7 percent to $37.21 after it reported results and said it would buy Adap.tv, a video ad platform, for $405 million.

In the sessions preceding recent comments by Fed officials, equities had struggled for direction in thin trading, with major indexes hovering near all-time highs and few clear catalysts to drive shares decisively higher. On Wednesday, the S&P; broke below 1,693.95, its 14-day moving average, which had been serving as a support level. “We’re still only a few points under our all-time high, so it isn’t surprising to see people take profits in a somewhat frothy market,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “At these levels, there’s plenty of room to the downside before there’s reason to be concerned.” Shares suffered their biggest daily decline since June 24 on Tuesday after comments from a pair of Fed officials muddied the water over how soon the central bank might reduce its bond-buying program.

Shares suffered their biggest daily decline since June 24 on Tuesday after comments from a pair of Fed officials muddied the water over how soon the central bank might reduce a stimulus policy widely credited with fueling the S&P; 500’s 19-percent gain this year. Before the comments, equities had struggled for direction, with major indexes hovering near all-time highs with few clear catalysts to drive shares decisively higher still. While the uncertainty could spur investors to take profits, the S&P; might find support at 1,693.95, its 14-day moving average. “I’d be very wary of expecting additional gains in the market at these levels,” said Tim Speiss, head of personal wealth advisors at EisnerAmper in New York. “I’m expecting a lot of volatility ahead, and maybe a sharp decline.” Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Tuesday the Fed would probably scale back its bond-buying program later this year, perhaps beginning to do so as early as next month depending on economic data. Those comments echoed earlier ones by Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, though he told Market News International the Fed might continue its stimulus program if growth doesn’t meet its targets. Equity markets have been closely tethered to central bank policy, with many investors concerned that economic growth isn’t robust enough to boost markets without the Fed’s help. Last week, the July payroll report came in much weaker than expected. “No one wants the Fed to stop purchasing (bonds) too soon, and there’s a concern that if it stops, there could be a slowdown in the economy,” said Speiss. Walt Disney Co fell 1.9 percent to $65.80 in premarket trading. On Tuesday, it projected a massive loss related to its summer film, “The Lone Ranger,” though adjusted earnings slightly beat expectations. S&P; 500 futures fell 4.6 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures slid 46 points and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 5 points. Time Warner Inc shares rose 3.3 percent to $66.20 in premarket trading after the company reported a bigger revenue than had been forecast. AOL Inc rose 3.9 percent to $37.60 before the bell after it reported results and said it would buy Adap.tv, a video ad platform, for $405 million.

491,DIS,PRESS DIGEST-New York Times business news - Aug 7,"Aug 7 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories on the New York Times business pages. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. * The Justice Department sued Bank of America on Tuesday, accusing the bank of defrauding investors by vastly understating the risks of the mortgages backing some $850 million in securities. The lawsuit adds to the hefty legal burden of the bank, which has been badly battered by mortgage-related losses and litigation since the financial crisis. () * It would not be surprising to see Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos worry little about turning a quick profit at his new acquisition, The Washington Post, and instead try to shake up the newspaper industry with innovation. () * President Obama endorsed efforts in the Senate to wind down mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and end their longtime implicit guarantee of a federal government bailout. () * Walt Disney Co’s net income fell 36 percent in its third quarter, in part because of marketing expenses for the flop “Lone Ranger”, forcing it to take a write-down of up to $190 million in the current quarter. Operating income from ESPN and Disney’s theme parks rose 8 percent and 9 percent respectively, driving Disney’s financial performance. () * Federal Reserve regional presidents Charles Evans and Dennis Lockhart suggested on Tuesday that the central bank could ease its extraordinary efforts to stimulate the economy sooner rather than later, but stopped short of providing an exact time frame. () * Swiss bank UBS AG agreed on Tuesday to pay $50 million to settle federal accusations that it misled investors about a complex mortgage security, a transaction that loomed over the government’s recent legal battle with a former Goldman Sachs trader blamed for his role in creating a similar security. () * Hedge fund tycoon Philip Falcone filed a lawsuit on Tuesday that accused the satellite television mogul Charles Ergen of colluding with another hedge fund in a “fraudulent scheme” that prevented his broadband wireless company, LightSquared, from emerging out of bankruptcy. () * Detroit’s financial woes have brought renewed scrutiny to public pension plans. Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, and others have suggested overhauling these plans to shift more responsibility to the private sector. Private insurance companies would assume responsibility for these defined benefit plans, offering annuities to beneficiaries in exchange for employer-paid premiums.

493,DIS,Marvel artist Kirby's heirs lose appeal over copyrights,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court ruled on Thursday that the heirs of comic book artist Jack Kirby had no rights to characters such as the Hulk and Fantastic Four that are now owned by Marvel Entertainment, a Walt Disney Co subsidiary. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an earlier decision finding that creations amounted to “works made for hire” under the federal copyright laws and belonged to Marvel. Kirby, who died in 1994, was an influential comic book artist, and fans closely associated him with the rise of Marvel Comics in the 1960s along with former editor and writer Stan Lee. Kirby helped create iconic characters including the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, the X-Men, Captain America and Thor, many of which have become the subjects of recent blockbuster films. Walt Disney Co bought Marvel for $4 billion in 2009. “Iron Man 3,” the latest Marvel movie based on a character Kirby helped create, has grossed $1.2 billion worldwide since May, according to Box Office Mojo. The lawsuit stemmed from documents Kirby’s heirs served Marvel in 2009, claiming rights to works he created from 1958 to 1963, when he was a freelance artist and drew some of Marvel’s most prized characters. Marvel subsequently sued the Kirbys in January 2010, seeking a court ruling declaring they had no rights to terminate the company’s rights to the characters. U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in July 2011 ruled for Marvel, finding the works constituted works for hire under the Copyright Act of 1909. In its ruling, the three-judge appeals panel upheld part of McMahon’s decision. “Marvel’s inducement, right to supervise, exercise of that right, and creative contribution with respect to Kirby’s work during the relevant time period is more than enough to establish that the works were created at Marvel’s instance,” U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Sack wrote. The ruling follows other fights by comic book writers, artists and their heirs to reclaim the rights to famed comic book characters. In June, the 2nd Circuit revived a lawsuit by former Marvel freelancer Gary Friedrich against the company over his rights to the motorcycle-riding vigilante character Ghost Rider. Trial in that case was pushed back to December 16 while Marvel and Friedrich pursue mediation and hopefully achieve a resolution,” according to an August 1 letter by a lawyer for Marvel. Jeff Klein, a spokesman for Marvel, said in an email that the comic company was “gratified by the appellate court’s definitive ruling that there is no legitimate basis to terminate our ownership of the copyrights at issue.” Marc Toberoff, a lawyer for the Kirbys, did not respond to requests for comment.

496,DIS,Disney's animated adventure 'Planes' enters tailwind of 'Cars',"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - For a film once slated to go straight to DVD, Disney’s animated adventure “Planes” has some lofty ambitions: it not only wants to be a worthy spin-off of the “Cars” franchise, it also aspires to tell a global story. Out in U.S. theaters on Friday, “Planes” portrays a fleet of aircraft that is as loveable as the automobiles in “Cars,” an underdog story of Dusty Crophopper who aspires to win the air racing championship that challenges contenders to fly around the globe. The modest crop duster faces two problems, sizable ones at that: he’s not built for racing and he is terrified of great heights. With all odds seemingly against him, Dusty trains with veteran naval plane Skipper and qualifies for the race. In his journey, Dusty befriends other racers such as El Chupacabra, a Mexican plane with mannerism and dress of a luchador wrestler, and Ishani, an exotic plane from India. “I thought it would be a great opportunity to throw this hurdle at Dusty, who is a small-town American guy, and actually get him out there to experience the world with all these different cultures and ethnicities and colors and sights,” “Planes” director Klay Hall told Reuters. The film features voice actors including Dane Cook, Teri Hatcher and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, but to tap into the global scope of the story, Hall brought on veteran British actor John Cleese as Bulldog, the oldest racing contender, and Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra to play Ishani. In one scene, Chopra’s character Ishani flies over India’s Taj Mahal with Dusty and says, “I have a billion fans and I can’t disappoint them.” Hall said that Chopra’s own background as a Bollywood celebrity helped bring authenticity to Ishani. “Planes,” made by Walt Disney Picture’s DisneyToon Studios for $50 million, was originally planned as a direct-to-DVD release. It was heavily inspired by the success of “Cars,” the Disney-Pixar hit film that made more than $461 million at the worldwide box office, according to Box Office Mojo. The sequel, “Cars 2,” garnered $559 million in global ticket sales. It will be tough for “Planes” to match the success of “Cars.” The film’s opening weekend at the box office is projected to come in at under $25 million, according to Box Office Mojo, while both “Cars” films had $60 million-plus openings in the more attractive release month of June. However, the “Cars” films cost $120 million and $200 million to make, respectively. Hall said he was under strict instruction from “Cars” director and Pixar co-founder John Lasseter to create new characters and a universe that would be loosely connected to “Cars” but not overlap. Making the aircraft look credible and adorable is straight out of the “Cars” playbook. Hall said the biggest challenge was getting the aircraft to look convincing in flight, from the naval corsairs to the crop dusters. “For the longest time, the planes looked like toys hanging from strings,” Hall explained. “We researched all of those airplanes and their flight dynamics ... and then we went out and recorded sounds from 23 different flights. Even though a plane works with specific characteristics, the sound has to work as well.” While “Planes” is an animated children’s film, the director said he was eager to “embrace the family” audience, steering away from slapstick humor and instead focusing on relationships spanning family, friends and love. “We don’t go to irreverence, we don’t go to funny body-function jokes. It’s more about trying to tell a sophisticated story with depth to your characters, and then I think you’ll get everyone on board,” Hall said.

498,DIS,Matt Damon thriller 'Elysium' flies above 'Planes' at box office,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Matt Damon sci-fi thriller “Elysium,” the story of an elite space outpost locked in battle with poor invaders from Earth, won a tight box-office race among four new films at U.S. and Canadian theaters. “Elysium” grabbed $30.5 million in domestic ticket sales from Friday through Sunday, edging Jennifer Aniston comedy “We’re the Millers,” which took in $26.6 million. Walt Disney Co animated movie “Planes” took the No. 3 slot with $22.5 million, according to studio estimates.     Fantasy movie “Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters” landed fourth with $14.6 million. “Elysium” portrays two worlds in the year 2154 - a diseased and overpopulated Earth, and Elysium, a space station where the elite live far from the seething masses. Damon stars as Max, a blue-collar worker with a criminal past who needs medicine from Elysium to survive. Jodie Foster plays the Elysium defense secretary bent on keeping Max and all other illegal immigrants out. “Planes,” a spin-off of Walt Disney Co’s Pixar franchise “Cars,” features the voice of Dane Cook as a crop duster with a fear of heights. The movie was produced by the DisneyToons studio and originally planned as a direct-to-DVD release. In “We’re the Millers,” Aniston plays a stripper enlisted by a small-time pot dealer (Jason Sudeikis) to pose as his wife when he puts together a phony family to help him smuggle marijuana into the United States. “Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,” a sequel to a 2010 release, is based on a series of books about a boy with special powers. In the new film, the boy, played by Logan Lerman, joins his friends on a quest for a golden fleece that will save their home. Sony Corp’s movie studio distributed “Elysium.” Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc, released “We’re the Millers.” “Percy Jackson” was distributed by 20th Century Fox, a unit of 21st Century Fox.

501,DIS,Dozens evacuated as Fla. resort buildings collapse into sinkhole,"Aug 12 (Reuters) - Dozens of guests at a Florida resort near Walt Disney World were evacuated early Monday, when at least two buildings partially collapsed after a sinkhole opened on the property’s grounds, guests and resort employees said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Guests “heard the building popping, and they all got out,” said a Summer Bay Resort security worker. He said the buildings at least partially collapsed into a sinkholes. Dora Dembley, another employee at the Clermont, Florida, resort near Orlando, said Lake County fire officials responded after at least two buildings on the 64-acre property were damaged late Sunday. “Everybody was cleared out of the buildings, so nobody got hurt,” said Dembley, who confirmed that multiple buildings were damaged, including one whose front was sheared off and appeared to sink into the ground. One witness told WFTV, a local television station, that “windows were breaking everywhere.” “One woman was sitting in the tub and the tub levitated, and that’s when she just grabbed a pair of shorts and came out ...” guest Maggie Ghamry told the station. She said another couple with an infant baby had to smash through a room window after the door frame collapsed. “It was the most ... surreal experience I never could have imagined in my wildest dreams.” Dembley said several dozen evacuated guests were being housed in other buildings on the property, about six miles from Walt Disney World. A spokesman for the Lake County Fire Department did not immediately return a call for comment.

502,DIS,Disney's ABC TV unit to lay off two percent of staff: source,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s ABC television unit on Wednesday will begin laying off about 175 people, or 2 percent of its workforce, to adjust to changes in technology and viewing habits, a person familiar with the decision said. The move was prompted by a company-wide review to explore cutbacks in jobs Disney no longer needs, either because of improvements in technology or redundancies following a string of major acquisitions in the past few years. Reuters first reported on the internal review in January. The new layoffs will occur across the Disney/ABC Television Group, which includes the ABC broadcast network as well as the Disney and ABC Family cable channels, the source said. Most of the cuts will come in technical operations, such as broadcast engineering, and at eight ABC-owned stations across the United States. An ABC statement did not confirm the numbers of job cuts but said the unit, which employs about 7,600 people, had reviewed its businesses and decided to restructure. “As technological advances continue to alter the competitive landscape and viewer habits, it’s incumbent upon us to stay ahead of the curve,” an ABC spokesman said in the statement. Other jobs may become available as Disney focuses on new technologies such as its Watch ABC app, which offers live streaming of the network’s programming on mobile devices, the source said. The company employed a similar restructuring strategy in 2010 at ABC News that strengthened that unit, the source said. The news division cut 400 jobs at the time, allowing it to shift focus and hire new people with different skills in growth areas. This year, Disney in April cut 150 jobs at its movie studio, 150 at its newly acquired Lucasfilm unit, and an undisclosed number in its consumer products division, sources told Reuters. Its ESPN sports network began eliminating 300 to 400 jobs in May, but a source said at the time that those cutbacks were unrelated to the broader review. Disney reported $1.85 billion in net income for the quarter that ended in June, a 1 percent gain from a year earlier. Operating income at media networks, the company’s largest unit which includes cable channels and ABC, rose 8 percent. Cable channels accounted for a 12 percent gain in quarterly operating income. At the ABC broadcast unit, operating income declined 21 percent due to higher prime time programming costs, lower program sales and decreased advertising revenue, the company said. ABC’s primetime ratings for the season that ended in May ranked fourth among the broadcast networks for 18- to 49-year-olds, the key group for advertisers, and second in total viewers, according to Nielsen. Disney shares have climbed 23 percent this year as the company has posted strong overall results overall lifted by media networks and theme parks.

504,DIS,ESPN denies it quit head injuries documentary over NFL ties,"(Reuters) - ESPN said it has pulled out of a documentary with PBS’ “Frontline” about head injuries in the National Football League, but the Walt Disney co-owned sports network denied a media report that its decision was due to pressure from the NFL. The New York Times reported on Friday that the league had expressed its displeasure with the direction of the “Frontline” documentary at a lunch last week attended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, NFL Network President Steve Bornstein, ESPN President John Skipper and ESPN Executive Vice President for Production John Wildhack. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the lunch was requested several weeks ago by ESPN and denied the Times’ report that the league demanded that the network withdraw from the project. “We meet with our business partners on a regular basis and this was not unusual,” McCarthy said via e-mail. “It is not true that we pressured ESPN to pull out of the film.” Two ESPN reporters had contributed work to the documentary, called “Frontline’s League of Denial: The NFL’s Concussion Crisis.” The network had originally agreed to let the production use its name and logos in a co-branding arrangement with “Frontline.” ESPN spokesman Chris LaPlaca said the decision by Skipper to end the relationship “was not a result of concerns about our separate business relationship with the NFL.” The network pulled out of the partnership because it did not have editorial control over what appeared on the series, he said. “In hindsight, we should have reached this conclusion much sooner,” LaPlaca said. “That was a mistake on our part.” ESPN, a major driver of Disney’s profit, broadcasts the NFL’s “Monday Night Football,” one of the highest-rated programs on television, under a multi-billion dollar deal with the league. In September 2011, the NFL announced an eight-year, $15.2 billion extension with ESPN for “Monday Night Football,” a deal that included TV and digital rights. NFL officials were unhappy with the crux of the “Frontline” documentary, the Times reported, citing two unnamed sources. The film is expected to show that the league had ignored evidence that its players’ were being exposed to brain injuries on the field that could cause long-term disability, the paper said. New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said the paper stood by its story. Producers for “Frontline” said ESPN’s decision will not affect the content, production or October release of the documentary. “We regret ESPN’s decision to end a collaboration that has spanned for 15 months,” they said in a statement published online on Thursday. Skipper, in a statement on Friday, said ESPN had been a leader in reporting on concussions among NFL players since the mid-1990s, including a recent report on its “Outside the Lines” program that aired twice after the lunch with NFL executives. “I want to be clear about ESPN’s commitment to journalism and the work of our award-winning enterprise team,” Skipper said. “We will continue to report this story and will continue to support the work of Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru,” the reporters who contributed to the “Frontline” documentary.

507,DIS,Disney delays 'Pirates' sequel after pushing up 'Ant-Man',"Sept 10 Los Angles(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Tuesday that it would delay the release of the film “Pirates of the Caribbean 5,” the latest in the blockbuster series starring Johnny Depp. The movie had been scheduled to open in theaters on July 10, 2015. Disney’s announcement gave no reason for the film’s delay. A person familiar with the project said studio executives did not think the script and other aspects of the film were ready for it to start production. No date was given for the film’s release. The delay on “Pirates 5” comes a day after the studio said it would move up the release of another big-budget film, “Ant-Man,” from October 2015 to July 31, 2015, three weeks after the John Depp film was originally scheduled to be released. “Ant-Man” is based on a super hero created by Marvel Comics, whose “Iron Man” and other action heroes have been made into hit movies.

The movie is set in a world where dinosaurs and humans co-exist. Pixar delayed the movie to provide time “to ensure we make the best film possible,” the studio said. “We continue to believe at Pixar, ‘quality is the best business plan,’ and we live by that,” the statement said. “The Good Dinosaur” moved to the release date previously held by “Nemo” sequel “Finding Dory.” Pixar pushed “Dory” to June 17, 2016, putting it in the summer movie season like the original film. The new schedule will make 2014 the first year since 2005 that Pixar has not released a film.

The companies are discussing a deal for Dish to continue carrying programming including sports network ESPN, the Disney Channel and ABC Family, according to a joint statement. They didn’t say how long the contract extension would last, nor provide any other details on their discussions. Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen has previously complained about the rising cost of sports programming. ESPN is the most expensive TV network, costing pay TV operators about $5.54 on average per subscriber each month, according to research firm SNL Kagan. Disney says it is getting paid for the value ESPN offers. On an Aug. 1 conference call with analysts, Ergen said he was optimistic his company would reach a deal with Disney, but also threatened to drop the channels if both sides couldn’t come to terms. “If we get that deal we’ll do it,” Ergen said. “If we don’t get that deal, we’ll part ways. Simple as that.” The talks between Disney and Dish also cover carriage of the ABC broadcast network in major markets including New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

That beat the 76 cents per share that was the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income for the quarter rose to $1.4 billion, a 12 percent gain from a year earlier. Shares of Disney slipped 2.8 percent in after-hours trading to $65.30, down from their earlier $67.15 close on the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s shares had gained nearly 35 percent this year before the earnings announcement. “There’s been such a run-up in this stock that people are just readjusting their numbers,” said Matthew Harrigan, a media analyst with Wunderlich Securities, who has a buy rating on the stock at $77 target. “There’s not much upside surprise with this company. It came in almost exactly what we expected.” Operating income at Disney’s cable network unit, which includes its powerhouse ESPN sports channel, decreased by 7 percent to $1.3 billion in the quarter, the company said, citing the timing of recording some ESPN affiliate fee revenue. Despite taking an undisclosed writedown for its summer flop “The Lone Ranger,” Disney’s studio reported a 35 percent rise in earnings during the quarter, boosted by its animated hit “Monsters University.” The film generated $743 million in worldwide ticket sales, according to the site Box Office Mojo. Operating income at theme parks grew 15 percent to $571 million as visitors increased spending at Disney theme parks in California and Florida. Disney’s Interactive unit turned around in the quarter, earning $16 million after losing $76 million a year ago, partially on sales of its new “Disney Infinity” console game. The company has sold more than 1 million Infinity starter packs, Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts on a conference call. At the consumer products unit, operating income rose 30 percent to $347 million. The growth was driven by licensing of products related to movies such as “Monsters University” and “Planes” as well as products included after the acquisition of “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm. Disney announced the next installment in the “Star Wars” film franchise will be released on December 18, 2015.

518,DIS,"UPDATE 2-Disney to release new 'Star Wars' film on Dec. 18, 2015","LOS ANGELES, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The next movie in the “Star Wars” franchise will arrive in theaters on Dec. 18, 2015, Walt Disney Co said on Thursday, two weeks after producers hired a new writer to shepherd the script into production. Disney purchased “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion in 2012 and promised at least three more films in the series, one of the biggest movie franchises of all time. “This, obviously, is one of the most important movies we have in the next few years, and we’ve chosen a date we believe will allow the creative team the time to make a great film,” Disney chief executive Bob Iger said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts. The pre-Christmas date puts the film’s release in the prime holiday movie season, a departure for the “Star Wars” franchise. The previous six films have all been released in May, in time for the summer movie season. Filming of the new movie, currently called “Star Wars: Episode VII,” is set to begin in spring 2014 and will be directed by J.J. Abrams, who is best known for directing the most recent films in the “Star Trek” science fiction series. Filming will take place in England, returning the franchise to its British roots as the six previous “Star Wars” films were all partly filmed at studios in Britain. No acting choices have been announced, but original cast members Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford have been in talks to appear in the upcoming film. Last month, producer Kathleen Kennedy said Lawrence Kasdan would team with Abrams to write the screenplay, replacing Oscar-winning screenwriter Michael Arndt on the project. Kasdan co-wrote the screenplays for the second and third “Star Wars” films, “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi.” The “Star Wars” franchise, which was created by director George Lucas, has grossed more than $4.4 billion at the worldwide box office since the first film was released in 1977.",11072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-starwars/update-2-disney-to-release-new-star-wars-film-on-dec-18-2015-idUSL2N0IS2DQ20131107

This is latest bid by the Internet movie and TV show streaming service to lure subscribers with original programming. Its success with series such as political satire “House of Cards” and dark prison comedy “Orange is the New Black” helped its customer base rise to 31.1 million U.S. streaming subscribers last quarter. The deal with Marvel will start in 2015, the companies said in a press release and last “multiple years.” Each of the four series will focus on Marvel characters, “Daredevil,” “Jessica Jones”, “Iron Fist” and “Luke Cage.” Netflix and Marvel were unavailable for comment on financial details on Thursday. Marvel has committed to a minimum of four 13-episode series and has also agreed to make a mini-series called “The Defenders.” The series will be produced by Marvel Television and ABC Television Studios. Marvel currently produces a show called “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” for ABC. Netflix has said it will double investments in original programming in 2014, when it will air second seasons of both “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black.” Spending on original shows is expected to remain below 10 percent of its global content expenses. This is Disney’s second high profile tie-up with Netflix. Last December, Disney became the first major studio to choose Netflix over cable TV networks for a large-scale movie licensing deal that will bring live and animated Disney, Pixar, Marvel Comics and Lucasfilm movies to the service starting in 2016.

Futures tumbled earlier after data showed 204,000 new jobs were created last month, much more than the expected 125,000, as it increased chances the Federal Reserve could begin to scale back its stimulus before the end of the year. Some market participants are, however, looking past the Fed taper and focusing on what the prospect of a better economy will mean for the equities market. “The first part of the equation for the Fed to taper is data showing the economy is getting better. If companies are doing well and business is good, you don’t need to have zero percent short-term money in order for the stock market to do well,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago. The strong data also sent U.S. Treasuries prices lower, lifting the benchmark 10-year yield to its highest in more than three weeks. A four-month rally in yields earlier this year pressured stocks, but the recent strong data has eased concerns over higher borrowing costs. “Most people in the market believe in the next couple years the 10-year yield will return to a 3-to-4 percent level, and a market trading at 17 times earnings is cheap still, in that environment,” Kuby said. The most recent trailing price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P; 500 is 16.2 according to Thomson Reuters data, with the forward P/E at 14.8. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 87.14 points or 0.56 percent, to 15,681.12, the S&P; 500 gained 15.8 points or 0.9 percent, to 1,762.95 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 53.685 points or 1.39 percent, to 3,911.017. Friday’s advance set the Dow and S&P; on track to close their fifth straight week of gains. Financial stocks led the charge on the S&P; 500 with a 1.7 percent advance, following a more than 1 percent drop in the sector on Thursday and on the expectation that higher rates will translate into stronger earnings. JPMorgan Chase added 3.6 percent to $53.52 while Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup  were all up more than 2 percent. On the other hand homebuilders, seen hurting if mortgage rates rise sharply, saw their stocks fall. Shares of Lennar , Ryland Group and Pulte Homes fell more than 4 percent each. Apparel retailer Gap’s shares led percentage gains on the S&P; 500 with a 9 percent advance a day after it posted October same-store sales that rose 4 percent, well ahead of the analysts’ average estimate of 0.1 percent. Santarus Inc surged 37.8 percent to $32 after Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd agreed to buy the drugmaker for about $2.6 billion. Salix shares jumped 18 percent to $84.14. Disney shares rose 2.9 percent to $69.13 after its profit jumped to beat Wall Street expectations, lifted by higher visitor spending at U.S. theme parks, increased consumer product sales and its summer animated movie hit “Monsters University.” Twitter shares fell 4.1 percent to $43.05 a day after its NYSE debut. Shares had rallied 72.7 percent Thursday, though they closed slightly below the opening print of $45.10.

The S&P; 500 suffered its biggest decline since August 27, weighed down by a drop in Qualcomm Inc and better-than-expected GDP data, which heightened expectations the Federal Reserve may begin to scale back its stimulus measures. Investors will look to the October employment report at 8:30 a.m (1330 GMT), which may provide further confirmation of an improving economy and clues to how long the Fed will maintain its bond-buying program of $85 billion a month. Economists in a Reuters survey predict 125,000 jobs were created in October compared with the 148,000 jobs created in September. The unemployment rate is seen at 7.3 percent against the 7.2 percent rate in September. “The jobs number is not expected to be terrific. In fact, the furloughed workers from the government shutdown will show up in this jobs number, so most people expect the unemployment rate to actually tick up,” said Keith Bliss, senior vice-president at Cuttone & Co in New York. “But it’s one of those numbers if you look at on the surface it will raise eyebrows but if you get underneath it will basically be discounted by all the econometric models on the Street.” The benchmark S&P; index is up 22.5 percent for the year, with gains largely driven by the Fed’s stimulus. Other economic data expected at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) include September personal income and consumption data. Economists in a Reuters survey expect a 0.3 percent rise in September income and a 0.2 percent increase in spending. Later in the session at 9:55 a.m. (1455 GMT), investors will eye the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers preliminary November consumer sentiment index. Expectations call for a reading of 74.5 compared with 73.2 in the final October report. S&P; 500 futures rose 1 point and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract.

530,DIS,"UPDATE 4-Disney beats Street on higher theme park spending, toy sales","By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co  reported a 12 gain in profit that beat Wall Street expectations, lifted by higher visitor spending at U.S. theme parks, increased consumer product sales and its summer animated movie hit “Monsters University.” The media company on Thursday posted diluted earnings per share of 77 cents for the quarter ended in September, edging the 76 cents average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income for the quarter rose to $1.4 billion, a 12 percent gain a year earlier. Shares of Disney, which have gained nearly 35 percent this year, slipped 1.8 percent in after-hours trading to $65.94, down from their earlier $67.15 close on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors reacted negatively to a prediction from Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo, on a post-earnings conference call, that capital expenditures will increase by $1 billion over 2013, said Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin. Most of those funds will go toward increased investment in the Shanghai Disney Resort scheduled to open in late 2015, Rasulo said. “The company had been saying that the capital expenditures were going down,” said Martin, who rates Disney stock a “hold.” “Markets look ahead,” he added. For the just-ended quarter, operating income at Disney’s cable network unit, which includes its powerhouse ESPN sports channel, decreased by 7 percent to $1.3 billion in the quarter, the company said, citing the timing of some ESPN affiliate fee revenue. Despite taking an undisclosed writedown for its summer flop “The Lone Ranger,” Disney’s movie studio reported a 35 percent rise in earnings during the quarter, boosted by Pixar prequel “Monsters University.” The film generated $743 million in worldwide ticket sales, according to the site Box Office Mojo. Disney also announced it will release the next installment in the blockbuster “Star Wars” film franchise on Dec. 18, 2015. Operating income grew 15 percent to $571 million at Disney’s parks and resorts unit, as visitors increased spending at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland Resort in California. Disney’s Interactive unit turned around in the quarter, earning $16 million after losing $76 million a year ago, partially on sales of its new Disney Infinity console game. The company has sold more than 1 million Infinity starter packs, Chief Executive Bob Iger said. “All indications suggest the strong demand for Disney Infinity will continue,” Iger said. At the consumer products unit, operating income rose 30 percent to $347 million. The growth was driven by licensing of products tied to films such as “Monsters University” as well as products included after last year’s acquisition of “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm. Iger said Disney was making progress in negotiations with Dish Network Corp to carry the company’s TV networks, though he said remaining issues “could take some time.” “Right now, the negotiation is more about issues related to technology,” he said. Iger also said he was not preparing to sell the ABC television stations that Disney owns, as some news outlets have reported. “I don’t think it would be wise to either predict or to conclude that these assets are on the market,” he said.",11082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-results/update-4-disney-beats-street-on-higher-theme-park-spending-toy-sales-idUSL2N0IS2CK20131108

535,DIS,UPDATE 4-Dish says closer to deal to keep Disney networks on board,"(Adds comments from conference call, new analyst comments) By Liana B. Baker and Sinead Carew Nov 12 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp is closer to reaching a large-scale programming deal with Disney that would help the satellite TV provider avoid a possible blackout of popular networks such as ABC and ESPN, Chairman Charlie Ergen said on Tuesday. He added that he is keeping the company’s options open with regards to possible alliances for use of billions of dollars worth of wireless spectrum the company has amassed. Shares rose more than 5 percent after the No. 2 U.S. satellite TV company reported better-than-expected subscriber numbers and revenue in the third quarter. Disney and Dish’s programming agreement expired at the end of September, but they have been in discussions and have so far averted a blackout of Disney’s top networks such as ABC and ESPN for the satellite provider’s 14 million customers. Ergen said that Disney is seeking a long-term contract lasting several years and “both sides are trying to look at where the technology is going...and what the world might look like in several years,” echoing comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger last week. Dish may be trying to get more flexibility out of Disney in a new contract that would include better digital rights and the ability to put channels on different tiers, said ISI analyst Vijay Jayant. Ergen also said it was too soon to finalize Dish’s strategy regarding the wireless spectrum the company has spent billions amassing. He analysts he would likely know more early next year after upcoming auctions of spectrum controlled by the government and bankrupt communications firm LightSquared. Ergen noted that anti-collusion rules will force a pause in any negotiations between applicants in the government auction starting from Nov. 15. The executive, who founded Dish 33 years ago, said he would look for ways to use wireless spectrum to enhance its video offerings rather than on areas such as voice, data and texting services which traditional wireless operators already “do pretty well.” “We have to make our video ubiquitous so that’s our focus,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that we would do other things but ideally it would be video-centric.” Otherwise Ergen said that he is keeping all options open, from the possibility for a purchase of No. 4 U.S. mobile operator T-Mobile US, to forging a partnership, building a wireless network or even selling Dish’s spectrum. Ergen also said that the news today that US Airways and AMR had reached a government antitrust settlement on their merger could bode well for a deal one day with DirecTV because it means the government is willing to “negotiate things.”  The two satellite companies attempted a merger that was blocked by regulators in 2001. “There’s obviously a business case that makes a lot of sense for consolidation in the satellite industry,” Ergen said. Dish added a surprise 35,000 video customers in the quarter.  Wall Street analysts, on average, had looked for Dish to lose 39,000 subscribers, according to market research firm StreetAccount. Revenue also topped analysts’ estimates. The gains underlined how satellite services are gaining customers by undercutting cable rivals on price. DirecTV  also added more customers than expected in the quarter, while cable providers Time Warner Cable Inc, Comcast Corp  and Charter Communications Inc all lost video subscribers. Dish also got a bit of a boost from Time Warner Cable’s protracted fight with CBS Corp. “Dish’s Q3 operating results were surprisingly good, as were DirecTV’s, boosted perhaps by the travails at Time Warner Cable, which got smoked in its programming dispute with CBS,” said Craig Moffett, a research analyst at MoffettNathanson. Revenue generated per subscriber rose to $81.05 from $76.99. Dish reported net income of $315 million, or 68 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a net loss of $158 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2 percent to $3.60 billion, compared with expectations of $3.58 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

541,DIS,'Catching Fire' Disney's 'Frozen' top record box office weekend,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” continued to light up the box office through the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, collecting a record $110.2 million over five days to surpass a hefty opening for Disney’s new animated film “Frozen,” and bringing its 10-day total to nearly $300 million. Moviegoers flooded theaters in record-setting numbers, dropping $294 million at box offices, besting the $290 million spent a year ago over the five-day period. “Catching Fire” and “Frozen” both beat the Thanksgiving box office record of $82.4 million set by “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” in 2001. “Frozen,” which critics lavishly praised, recorded ticket sales of $93 million at U.S. and Canadian theaters for the five-day holiday period that began on Wednesday, according to studio estimates compiled by Reuters. That far exceeded industry projections of about $63 million. “Frozen,” inspired by “The Snow Queen” fairytale, features the voice of Kristen Bell as a Scandinavian princess intent on finding her sister, the Queen, who has the power to freeze anything with a touch and accidentally sets off a long winter that is destroying their kingdom. “This was much more than we ever could have thought,” said Dave Hollis, executive vice president of distribution for Walt Disney Studios, of “Frozen”‘s strong opening, adding it was the biggest-ever opening for one of its animated releases. Disney’s action film “Thor: The Dark World,” based on the character from its Marvel comic book unit, was third with $15.5 million in ticket sales, according to data compiled by Rentrak. “Catching Fire,” the sequel to the 2012 blockbuster “The Hunger Games,” stars Jennifer Lawrence as heroine Katniss Everdeen, the skilled archer who becomes a beacon of hope for an oppressed society. The movies, distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment, are based on a series of novels by Suzanne Collins. The film set a November opening weekend record of $158.1 million, then smashed the Thanksgiving five-day mark in its second week. It already ranks third on this year’s list of top-grossing films, according to data compiled by Rentrak, behind “Iron Man 3” and “Despicable Me 2.” Its global total is $573 million. Rounding out the top five were strong-performing “The Best Man Holiday,” starring Taye Diggs and Terrence Howard, with $11.1 million, and “Homefront,” which collected $9.8 million in its debut weekend. The R-rated “Homefront,” written by Sylvester Stallone, features British action star Jason Statham as a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent who moves to a small town to raise his daughter but tangles with a local drug lord. “Black Nativity,” a musical from Fox Searchlight starring Forest Whitaker, Jennifer Hudson and Angela Bassett, only managed the No. 8 spot with $5 million in sales for its opening weekend. “Frozen,” a $150 million film, is the latest from Disney’s animation studio, which has enjoyed a revival since 2006 when the company acquired Pixar. Disney had a big hit in the 2010 “Tangled” and last November with “Wreck-it-Ralph.” Hollis said the studio expected the film would play well through the Christmas season, noting that “there are not a lot of family (film) options” opening in the coming weeks.

545,DIS,Comcast tests new ad tech to help networks capture binge viewers,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable operator, is testing new advertising technology that inserts up-to-date commercials into past episodes of TV shows that are available on demand, a development that could help television networks generate additional revenue. As people get used to catching up on or binging on older episodes of shows through online services like Netflix and Hulu, cable companies and TV networks are plying viewers with past episodes from current seasons that can be watched on demand through their cable set-top boxes. The new technology is meant to give TV networks a way to earn ad dollars from earlier episodes. Currently, most advertisers only pay for ads watched live or within three days after a show airs. That could change if Comcast’s technology, which it developed in partnership with Nielsen, is widely adopted. With the new service it is testing, Comcast will take the same commercials that aired live and insert them into a show’s older episodes that are watched on demand. TV networks can try to broker deals with advertisers to pay for the additional viewership, which will be measured by Nielsen. For now, the technology only applies to shows on broadcast TV networks. Comcast subscribers cannot fast-forward ads when they watch on-demand shows from the broadcast networks. Comcast is testing the new ad service with shows on NBC, the broadcast network it owns, as well as Walt Disney Co’s ABC network, said Matt Strauss, Comcast’s senior vice president of video services. CBS is also interested, Strauss said. The company aims to make the service available for the ad market next year. “This becomes a new way for programmers to monetize not just the most recent episode, but every episode, which has pretty big implications,” Strauss said. The video on-demand market for ads totals about $1 billion year, according to research firm Rentrak and can grow with these new developments. It is unclear if advertisers are on-board with paying networks for the new on-demand credits and it’s up to the networks to pitch them, Strauss said. Comcast is the biggest cable provider with more than 22 million video subscribers, providing a large potential audience to test the idea with advertisers.

TV networks can try to broker deals with advertisers to pay for the additional viewership, which will be measured by Nielsen. For now, the technology only applies to shows on broadcast TV networks. Comcast subscribers cannot fast-forward ads when they watch on-demand shows from the broadcast networks. Comcast is testing the new ad service with shows on NBC, the broadcast network it owns, as well as Walt Disney Co’s  ABC network, said Matt Strauss, Comcast’s senior vice president of video services. CBS is also interested, Strauss said. The company aims to make the service available for the ad market next year. “This becomes a new way for programmers to monetize not just the most recent episode, but every episode, which has pretty big implications,” Strauss said. The video on-demand market for ads totals about $1 billion year, according to research firm Rentrak and can grow with these new developments. It is unclear if advertisers are on-board with paying networks for the new on-demand credits and it’s up to the networks to pitch them, Strauss said. Comcast is the biggest cable provider with more than 22 million video subscribers, providing a large potential audience to test the idea with advertisers.

549,DIS,Disney secures rights for future 'Indiana Jones' films,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co has gained marketing and distribution rights for any future “Indiana Jones” films under an agreement with Paramount Pictures, the studio that released the first four movies in the blockbuster franchise. Paramount, a unit of Viacom Inc, will retain distribution rights to the original four films, the companies said in a statement on Friday. The “Indiana Jones” movies were produced by Lucasfilm, which Disney acquired in 2012. Disney has not announced plans for a fifth “Indiana Jones” movie, though the new deal could make it easier to move forward on a new installment. Paramount will receive an undisclosed share of the proceeds from any future films. The series began with 1981 film “Raiders of the Lost Ark” starring Harrison Ford as a hero archeologist. Ford starred in three later films, most recently “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” in 2008. Steven Spielberg directed each of the four movies, which have grossed $1.9 billion worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo.

553,DIS,"'Frozen,' 'Catching Fire' fuel U.S., Canada box office","LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s animated princess fairy tale “Frozen” heated up movie box office charts in the United States and Canada, displacing dystopian thriller “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” as the top-earning film. “Frozen” sold $31.6 million worth of tickets from Friday through Sunday during its second weekend in theaters to top domestic movie charts, while “Catching Fire” earned $27 million, according to studio estimates from Rentrak. The weekend’s only new nationwide release, crime thriller “Out of the Furnace,” took a distant third place with $5.3 million. Global sales for “Frozen,” a solid holiday season hit, climbed to $190 million through Sunday, Disney said. The 3D movie, inspired by “The Snow Queen” fairytale, features the voice of Kristen Bell as a Scandinavian princess intent on finding her sister, the Queen, who has the power to freeze anything with a touch and accidentally sets off a long winter that is destroying their kingdom. “Catching Fire,” the second of the “Hunger Games” films based on novels by Suzanne Collins, brought its global total to a massive $673.4 million, according to distributor Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. The movie stars Jennifer Lawrence as heroine Katniss Everdeen, a skilled archer who provides hope for an oppressed society on the edge of rebellion. Lions Gate noted that the U.S. weather in recent days, with several winter storm systems in play, likely had an impact on box office results. Third-place film “Out of the Furnace” stars Christian Bale and Casey Affleck as brothers in a working-class Pennsylvania steel town. When one of the brothers disappears, the other sets out to find him and enact revenge. “Out of the Furnace” was distributed by privately held Relativity Media and cost $22 million to make. Critics were split on the film. As of Saturday, the movie scored a 51 percent positive rating among reviews collected on the Rotten Tomatoes website. In a statement, Relativity called the “a daring story from a renowned director and an award-winning cast,” adding “While we had hoped it would perform better this weekend, we are all proud of this movie.” Rounding out the charts, Marvel superhero sequel “Thor: The Dark World,” which stars Chris Hemsworth as the god of thunder, earned $4.7 million. “Delivery Man,” featuring Vince Vaughn as a sperm donor who fathers more than 500 children, finished fifth, grossing $3.8 million. Disney distributed “Thor” and “Delivery Man.” Next weekend, theaters are expected to be busy with fans turning out for “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,” the second of three movies based on the fantasy novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. Last year’s blockbuster “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” earned $1 billion at theaters worldwide.

556,DIS,'Saving Mr. Banks' rescues the complex mind behind 'Mary Poppins',"BURBANK, California (Reuters) - In the leafy, idyllic setting that is the Disney Studios lot, author P.L. Travers made life hell for writers and composers and Walt Disney himself in a movie that portrays her as a withering, brick wall, toxic nightmare of a woman. It is not quite the demeanor one would expect from the creator of one of the most beloved of children’s books, “Mary Poppins.” But Travers was so worried that Disney and his dream factory would ruin her story of the magical, flying British nanny that she subverted their work at every turn during two weeks at the Burbank studios in 1961. The entertaining push and pull between the acid-tongued Travers and the Disney storytellers is the heart of “Saving Mr. Banks,” a film, from Walt Disney Co of course, that opens in limited release in U.S. theaters on Friday and nationwide a week later. It stars Oscar winners Emma Thompson as Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Thompson, in a role that has generated buzz of a best actress Oscar nomination, had no shortage of biographical material from which to pull together her haughty middle-aged Pamela Lyndon Travers. But six hours of actual recordings of Travers with her Disney writers and songwriters might have revealed the most about her personality and the suffering that lies beneath artistic creation. She cringed at the thought of animation and dancing penguins and even the songs themselves. “You can hear in the juddering...the distress in it, of course,” said Thompson, mimicked Travers’ clipped British accent and tone of disdain. “One of the most revealing things was that, overtly, she was here to cooperate. Covertly, she was here to sabotage, and that was a wonderful thing to play with.” And sabotage she did, though obviously not enough to stop the film, which was released in 1964, three decades after the first “Mary Poppins” book, and went on to win five Oscars. While the film isn’t quite suitable for the little ones like “Mary Poppins” - due to the dark parts of Travers’ Australian childhood that inspired her work - it is expected to fare well at the box office as a holiday family film. “Saving Mr. Banks” is expected to gross $16 million to $18 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales during the December 20 weekend, according to Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst for Exhibitor Relations Co. The movie cost $35 million to produce. “Saving Mr. Banks” has garnered positive early reviews, with many critics praising the performances above all. But reviews noted a sympathetic depiction of Disney, even though he courted controversy as one of the most powerful studio bosses. Director John Lee Hancock, who also directed the 2009 family drama “The Blind Side,” noted that the script was developed outside Disney, but was easily accepted by its top brass. The Disney family also had to give its approval. “I don’t think this movie could have been developed within the walls of Disney,” Hancock said. “I think they would have chipped away at Walt and made him flawless.” The Walt Disney portrayed by Hanks smokes, drinks scotch and curses and tries to get away without inviting Travers to the “Mary Poppins” premiere. Hancock said he was “terrified” and “ready for war” with the studio over the depiction, but in the end, he “didn’t need to go to battle.” Disney had worked for two decades to bring “Mary Poppins” to the screen, as a promise to his daughters. He was only able to lure Travers from her London home to Burbank when her sales were faltering and her career was flagging. The film shows Disney as a hands-on boss, interrupting Travers’ intense, biting sessions with screenwriter Don DaGradi, played by Bradley Whitford, and the composing Sherman brothers played by BJ Novak and Jason Schwartzman, who playfully toil on tunes like “Let’s Go Fly a Kite.” And despite Travers’ biting and belittling ways, Whitford notes that “she’s right. What really matters to her is the emotional integrity which she begins to understand as the reason she wrote this stuff in the first place.” The film opens with one of many flashback scenes to her childhood, as the eldest daughter of a tender but terribly flawed father played by Colin Farrell. He is the inspiration for Mr. Banks, the banker father of the children in “Mary Poppins” who is ultimately saved by the nanny. Eventually, Disney, breaks down Travers’ resistance by showing her that he too had a dark childhood and that storytelling was also his way to deal with the pain. A few years later, as Travers attends the film’s premiere, tears stream down her face. Hancock said Thompson makes the role look “effortless,” but he saw in filming the toll that playing a complicated and sad woman took on his lead actress. “She suffered,” said Thompson, “and I was there.” ",12112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-savingmrbanks/saving-mr-banks-rescues-the-complex-mind-behind-mary-poppins-idUSBRE9BA0IU20131211

Dorsey, widely credited with creating Twitter alongside fellow co-founders like Ev Williams, Biz Stone and Noah Glass, will stand for election at Disney’s March 18 annual meeting, Disney said in a statement on Monday. At 36, Dorsey, who is also CEO of fast-growing payments startup Square, will be by far the media conglomerate’s youngest board member. Dorsey, who sent the company’s first tweet in 2006 - “just setting up my twttr” - spent the past few years molding San Francisco-based Square into a billion-dollar payments company whose matchbox-sized card readers are a common sight in coffee shops, corner stores and food trucks across the country. In November, Twitter’s initial public offering valued Dorsey’s roughly 4.9 percent stake in the messaging service at about $1 billion. “Jack Dorsey is a talented entrepreneur who has helped create groundbreaking new businesses in the social media and commerce spaces,” said Iger, who is also Disney’s chairman. “The perspective he brings to Disney and its Board is extremely valuable.” Iger’s bonus was reduced by $3 million because Disney’s “strong” results did not outperform his targets “by the same extraordinary amount as in fiscal 2012,” the board said in a proxy filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. The reduced 2013 salary also included what Disney said was an increase in the discount rate that caused “a change in the value of his pension benefit of $3.1 million.” The Disney board did not change Iger’s $2.5 million salary from 2012 when he earned $40.2 million. In awarding Iger a $13.6 million cash performance bonus, the board’s compensation committee said Disney did beat Iger’s four financial performance measures taken together. But the weighted average of 112 percent of the targets fell below the 132 percent in 2012. Those measures include segment operating income, diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis, after-tax free cash flow, and return on invested capital.

Keep smiling :),” Cyrus posted on Twitter, referring to her fans who are known as “Smilers.” The “Adore You” video mirrors Cyrus’s prior clothes-shedding and headline-grabbing performances this year as the 21-year-old leaves behind her squeaky-clean Disney image to become the sexually provocative, marijuana-smoking bad girl of pop music. Her previous music video for the song “Wrecking Ball,” directed by celebrity photographer Terry Richardson, showed Cyrus swinging from a wrecking ball clad only in boots. “Wrecking Ball” was the quickest video to hit 100 million views on the online music video syndicating service Vevo — a record that Cyrus said she wanted to break. The video is part of Cyrus’s promotional blitz for her album “Bangerz.” She is also set to perform in New York City’s Times Square on ABC television’s annual “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” on December 31. Cyrus and her persona have been a constant in tabloid headlines and television chatter since her scrutinized performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September when she “twerked” (a sexually suggestive dance) during a performance of Robin Thicke’s song “Blurred Lines.” ",12262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mileycyrus/miley-cyrus-makes-underwear-top-prop-in-new-music-video-idUSBRE9BP0H420131226
568,DIS,"Miley Cyrus says after Disney, it was time to be herself","LOS ANGELES, Dec 27 (Reuters) - It is sex, drugs and pop music - and Miley Cyrus is fine with it that way now that the provocative singer has shed her innocent Disney star image along with most of her clothes. Cyrus, 21, who has grabbed headlines in the past year for her admitted drug use, sexually suggestive dancing and wearing as little as boots in a music video, said she was surprised by the scrutiny her new persona has attracted. “I went from people just thinking I was, like, a baby to people thinking I’m this, like, sex freak that really just pops molly and does lines all day,” Cyrus told the New York Times in an interview to be published on Sunday and made available early online, referring to the drugs MDMA and cocaine, respectively. “It’s like, ‘Has anyone ever heard of rock ‘n’ roll?’” the “Wrecking Ball” singer countered. “There’s a sex scene in pretty much every single movie, and they go, ‘Well, that’s a character.’ Well, that’s a character. I don’t really dress as a teddy bear and, like, twerk on Robin Thicke, you know?” Cyrus, who rose to prominence as a teen star of the Disney musical TV series “Hannah Montana,” has become a bad girl of pop music since her performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September when she “twerked” (a sexually suggestive dance) during a performance of Thicke’s hit “Blurred Lines.” “I don’t have a bunch of celeb friends, because I feel like some of them are a little scared of the association,” Cyrus said of her new persona. “This is terrible. I was backstage with (the rising pop star) Ariana Grande. I’m like, ‘Walk out with me right now and get this picture, and this will be the best thing that happens to you, because just you associating with me makes you a little less sweet.’” Cyrus, whose newest music video “Adore You” shows her  writhing between bed sheets in her underwear, sucking her thumb and rubbing her body, said she feels more free to be herself now that she is no longer under a Disney contract. “When I was no longer employed by anyone, that’s when I was like, ‘O.K., I’m going to do my own thing.’ But I waited until I felt like I had respectfully finished out what I was supposed to do, you know?” she said. Cyrus signed with label RCA this year after releasing her first three albums on Disney’s Hollywood Records. Cyrus, the daughter of country music singer Billy Ray Cyrus, also fired back at pop star Joe Jonas, formerly of the Jonas Brothers, who said Cyrus and pop singer Demi Lovato introduced him to marijuana. “If you want to smoke weed, you’re going to smoke weed,” Cyrus said. “There’s nothing that two little girls are going to get you to do that you don’t want to do.”   (Reporting by Eric Kelsey; Editing by Mary Milliken and Cynthia Osterman)",12272013,http://www.reuters.com/article/people-mileycyrus/miley-cyrus-says-after-disney-it-was-time-to-be-herself-idUSL2N0K616M20131227
569,DIS,UPDATE 2-A&E; calls Phil Robertson back to 'Duck Dynasty' after anti-gay flap,"By Eric Kelsey LOS ANGELES, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Cable network A&E; said on Friday it was bringing back family patriarch Phil Robertson to the hit reality show “Duck Dynasty” after fans protested his suspension over anti-gay remarks and big-name corporate sponsors stuck by the series. Robertson’s remarks to GQ magazine and his subsequent suspension by A&E; sparked a nationwide debate over tolerance and religion, with conservative politicians and fans saying that Robertson’s beliefs were consistent with the Bible. “As a global media content company, A&E; Networks’ core values are centered around creativity, inclusion and mutual respect,” A&E; said in a statement released late Friday in the midst of the holiday season. “We believe it is a privilege for our brands to be invited into people’s homes and we operate with a strong sense of integrity and deep commitment to these principles.” It was a quick reversal for the network that is jointly owned by Walt Disney Co. and privately held Hearst Corp, but the move was not entirely surprising, given the financial commitment at stake. The controversy was also seen as a test for the entertainment industry’s appeal to audiences in the heartland of America. “Duck Dynasty” ranks among the most-watched cable television programs and averages about 8 million viewers per episode. Its fifth season is slated to begin on Jan. 15. The show’s fourth season debuted in August to 11.8 million viewers, a record for a cable nonfiction series, according to the network. “Duck Dynasty” sponsors and retailers selling branded merchandise, such as Target and Walmart, also stuck with the show, although they did not pick sides in the public debate. Restaurant chain Cracker Barrel notably bowed to customer pressure last weekend and restocked its Phil Robertson-themed merchandise after initially pulling it from shelves. “Duck Dynasty” merchandise, which ranges from sporting goods and apparel to camouflage furniture, has brought in some $400 million in sales, according to Forbes magazine. By lifting Robertson’s suspension after nine days, A&E; assures that the 67-year-old will not miss production of the series’ sixth season and staves off any potential mutiny by the remainder of the family if he were to be kept off the show. Robertson, the leader of the backwater Louisiana clan on the reality show about hunting, fishing and domestic squabbles, was put on indefinite “hiatus” on Dec. 18 by A&E; for his remarks to GQ characterizing homosexuality as sinful behavior. “Start with homosexual behavior and just morph from there,” Robertson said when asked what is sinful. “Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.” A&E; said it would also air a national public service campaign “promoting unity, tolerance and acceptance among all people” on all its affiliated networks, which include the History Channel and Lifetime among others. Although Robertson never apologized for his comments, his family did say they regretted his “coarse language,” which included graphic descriptions of male and female anatomy. The family also said it would not continue with the show without its patriarch and was in talks with the network. A&E; said at the time it was disappointed after reading Robertson’s remarks, which it added were his personal views and did not reflect those of the network. The network’s quick move to suspend Robertson hours after the GQ story appeared online also stood in contrast to fellow cable networks The Food Network and MSNBC, which both waited days before recently parting with Southern food doyen Paula Deen and actor Alec Baldwin, respectively, after they both admitted to using slurs. Vocal opposition from “Duck Dynasty” fans was swift in coming and an online petition started by Faith Driven Consumer, a group that connects Christian shoppers with faith-compatible companies, gained more than 260,000 signatures since Robertson’s suspension began. Robertson’s suspension also elicited strong reaction from across the political spectrum, with conservative politicians defending Robertson as a victim of political correctness. Early in the controversy, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal lent his support to Robertson and his family, who turned their animal-call company Duck Commander into a hunting industry leader and helped boost tourism to the state. “I’m glad to hear that A&E; came to its senses & recognized that tolerance of religious views is more important than political correctness,” he said on Twitter. “Back on,” Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz tweeted in reference to Robertson. Gay equality group GLAAD condemned Robertson’s comments, saying he knows nothing about gay people. “Phil’s decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E; and his sponsors, who now need to reexamine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT people and families,” GLAAD said in a statement at the time. GLAAD could not be reached for comment on Friday.",12282013,http://www.reuters.com/article/television-duckdynasty/update-2-ae-calls-phil-robertson-back-to-duck-dynasty-after-anti-gay-flap-idUSL2N0K619E20131228
570,DIS,Disney film 'Iron Man 3' hottest ticket of 2013 -Rentrak,"Jan 3 (Reuters) - Walt Disney’s film “Iron Man 3” was the hottest film of 2013, with ticket sales of $409 million in the North American market, one of four Disney films among the year’s top-selling movies, according to Rentrak. “Iron Man 3,” which stars Robert Downey Jr. as industrialist Tony Stark and his alter ego inside the super-charged metal suit, finished just ahead of Lions Gate Entertainment’s  dystopian action film “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,” which had ticket sales of $398.4 million, the entertainment research service said. Comcast’s Universal Pictures animated film “Despicable Me 2” was third with $367.8 million. “Man of Steel” from Time Warner’s studio Warner Brothers was fourth with $291 million. Warner Brothers, whose film “Gravity” also placed in the top 10, ended the year with 17 percent of the year’s record $10.9 billion in ticket sales, tops among Hollywood studios and ahead of Disney’s 15.7 percent, according to Rentrak. Disney’s animated films “Frozen” and “Monsters University” and its fantasy film “Oz the Great and Powerful” were also among the year’s top 10 best-selling movies. The media giant’s films came during the first full year of Disney CEO Bob Iger’s strategy of investing in films with hefty budgets that Disney can turn into “brands” that bring in box office receipts, spawn movie sequels, drive toy sales and inspire theme-park rides. “Iron Man 3” was made for $200 million, according to the film website Box Office Mojo. The North American market includes theaters in the United States and Canada.",1032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/hollywood-films/disney-film-iron-man-3-hottest-ticket-of-2013-rentrak-idUSL2N0KD16320140103
571,DIS,'Frozen' ices competition to win post-holiday box office race,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s animated fairy tale “Frozen” took hold of first place on movie charts in the United States and Canada for the first weekend of 2014, knocking three-time champion “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug” down to the No.3 spot. Second place went to new horror movie “Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones”, a spinoff from the hit low-budget “Paranormal Activity” franchise. “Frozen,” which opened on the eve of the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend in November, collected $20.7 million in ticket sales to claim the weekend box office crown, ahead of “The Marked Ones” which earned $18.2 million from Friday through Sunday, according to estimates from Rentrak. Kristen Bell provides the voice for the lead character in “Frozen,” the story of a Scandinavian princess on a search for her missing sister, the queen. The hit film is nearing a $300 million domestic total and has collected $640 million in global ticket sales, making it the highest-grossing Disney Animation release of all-time behind only “The Lion King,” Disney said. “The Marked Ones” introduces new characters and a different story to the hit “Paranormal” franchise produced by horror filmmaker Jason Blum. The new installment, designed to appeal specially to Latino moviegoers, features Hispanic actors and some Spanish dialogue in a story about a young man (Andrew Jacobs) in Oxnard, California, who learns he is marked for possession by a demon. Like its predecessors, the film uses a “found footage” style that captures encounters with invisible forces on camera. Distributor Paramount Pictures released “The Marked Ones” in January to give audiences something new after the family fare and adult dramas that crowded theaters around Christmas. Box office forecasters had predicted the movie would start with $19 million to $23 million over the weekend. It cost just $5 million to make, a small sum for a Hollywood release. “Clearly the (inclement) weather was a factor. Everyone took a hit,” said Don Harris, president of domestic theatrical distribution for Paramount, a unit of Viacom Inc. “But you tend to get the business back the next weekend,” he added. Harris said the film played, as expected, to a predominantly Hispanic audience in the largest theaters, performing especially well in the Southwest. But he noted that it also did not underperform among other demographic groups. The first four “Paranormal” films, each released in October, have pulled in $720.7 million in worldwide ticket sales, according to the Box Office Mojo website. “Paranormal Activity 5” is scheduled for release in October. “Smaug,” which took in $16.3 million after three straight weeks at No.1 to fall to third place, is the second installment in the “Hobbit” fantasy series and follows the quest of Bilbo Baggins and a band of dwarves as they clash with a fire-breathing dragon. Rounding out the charts, director Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which stars Leonardo DiCaprio in the biographical story of a drug-snorting Wall Street scam artist, took the No. 4 spot with $13.4 million. Fifth place went to 1970s crime caper “American Hustle.” The critically praised film stars Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in a story loosely based on a real-life corruption scandal involving U.S. politicians, and took in $13.2 million. “The Wolf of Wall Street” was distributed by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom.

574,DIS,Video service Hulu adds new shows to original series slate,"LOS ANGELES, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Video streaming website Hulu is expanding its slate of original programming in 2014 and will introduce four new series including reality TV satire “The Hotwives of Orlando” and supernatural comedy “Deadbeat.” Hulu on Wednesday announced it also will release new episodes this year of six other exclusive series, including comedian Seth Meyers’ animated superhero show “The Awesomes,” and “Moone Boy,” starring “Bridesmaids” actor Chris O’Dowd. The video streaming site, which offers next-day repeats of shows on broadcast TV networks ABC, Fox and NBC, is expanding its original programming to lure new viewers. The company competes with services like Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Instant Video. Hulu offers free movies and TV shows for viewing on a computer through advertising-supported Hulu.com. It charges $8 a month for additional shows through Hulu Plus, which can be streamed on Internet-connected TVs and mobile devices. The service is owned by Walt Disney Co, 21st Century Fox and Comcast Corp. Last year the media giants considered selling the website but decided to keep it and invest $750 million. A “significant portion” of that investment “will go toward bringing exclusive first-run content onto the service,” Charlotte Koh, head of development for Hulu Originals, said in an interview. “We are definitely increasing the number of shows we are producing in-house and acquiring,” she said. “The breadth and variety of it is becoming a little wider.” Last year, Hulu released about 20 exclusive shows, including original productions and imports of foreign series. This year’s “The Hotwives of Orlando” is a spoof of Bravo’s “Real Housewives” reality TV series and is produced by Paramount Digital Entertainment, the studio behind “Burning Love,” a satire of “The Bachelor” dating competition. “Deadbeat,” a co-production with Lionsgate Television , is a comedy about a medium who helps ghosts settle unfinished business. Stars include Tyler Labine of former CW show “Reaper” and “So You Think You Can Dance” host Cat Deeley. Hulu’s other new shows are “The Next Step,” about a group of teen dancers, and “The Bridge,” a Scandinavian crime drama. Hulu’s revenue was expected to reach $1 billion in 2013, according to a Dec. 18 blog post from CEO Mike Hopkins. The service launched in 2008. The company will announce more shows for 2014 later this year, Koh said.",1082014,http://www.reuters.com/article/hulu-shows/video-service-hulu-adds-new-shows-to-original-series-slate-idUSL2N0KH1PX20140108

577,DIS,'Lone Survivor' outmuscles 'Hercules' to win U.S. box office,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - “Lone Survivor,” the true story of a failed U.S. Navy SEALS mission to capture or kill a Taliban leader in Afghanistan, collected $38.5 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales, topping movie “Frozen” to win the weekend box office race. The film stars Mark Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell, the only one of four SEALS to return from the mission and who wrote the 2007 book on which the movie is based. “Frozen,” a Walt Disney Co animated film and last week’s box office winner, was second with ticket sales of $15.1 million from Friday through Sunday, according to estimates from Rentrak. “The Wolf of Wall Street,” a tale of greed starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was third with $9 million, while this week’s other new major release, “The Legend of Hercules,” starring fashion model and actor Kellan Lutz, was just behind, selling $8.6 million in tickets. “Hercules” was tied for fourth place with “American Hustle,” an awards-season favorite directed by David O. Russell and starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. “Lone Survivor,” directed and written by “Friday Nights Lights” director Peter Berg, was the subject of a Hollywood bidding war in 2007 won by Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures. The movie cost $40 million to make, Universal said. The heavily marketed film far exceeded industry projections of about $23 million in domestic sales, including theaters in the United States and Canada. It was the second biggest January opening weekend ever, behind only “Cloverfield,” which made $40 million, according to Rentrak. “You can’t make predictions on films like this,” said Nikki Rocco, Universal’s president for domestic distribution, adding “You just don’t know how the public is going to embrace it.” But decent reviews along with what Rocco called “a grassroots campaign to tell Americans that this is a story of patriotism and heroism, and you’re going to want to be a part of the water cooler conversation about it on Monday,” sent its box office sales soaring. The film received a 73 rating from aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences gave the film an A+ grade, according to CinemaScore, which measures ticket buyer reactions. “The Legend of Hercules,” which was forecast to have ticket sales of $8 million, is the first of two films based on the son of the Greek god Zeus. The second “Hercules” stars professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson, also known as “The Rock,” and is scheduled for release on July 25. “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug” was sixth with $8 million in ticket sales. After leading the domestic box office during the last three weeks of 2013, the movie, the second of a three-part adaption of J.R.R. Tolkien’s 1937 novel, has hauled in $242 million domestically and $809 million globally.

579,DIS,UPDATE 1-Michael Douglas wants to surprise audiences with Marvel's 'Ant-Man',"By Mary Milliken LOS ANGELES, Jan 13 (Reuters) - After throwing audiences a curveball by playing flamboyant pianist Liberace, leading man Michael Douglas is ready to make another unconventional career choice, this time playing scientist Hank Pym in Marvel superhero film “Ant-Man.” Disney-owned Marvel said on Monday that Douglas, 69, will play Henry ‘Hank’ Pym, the creator of the technology to shrink a human to the size of an insect and thus become Ant-Man. “Anchorman” star Paul Rudd, 44, will play Scott Lang, the alter-ego of the diminutive Marvel superhero. “I’ve been dying to do a Marvel picture for so long,” Douglas told Reuters on Monday. “The script is really fun, the director is really good. Dylan (the actor’s 13-year-old son) will love it. He’ll have a picture he can see.” Pym’s character first appeared in the 27th issue of Marvel Comics series “Tales to Astonish” in January 1962. Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, said in a statement posted on Marvel.com that Douglas will play Pym with “charm and fortitude.” Douglas, who won a Best Actor Oscar in 1988 for Oliver Stone’s financial drama “Wall Street” and picked up a Golden Globe award on Sunday for his turn as Liberace in HBO movie “Behind the Candelabra,” is taking a rare step into the world of big-budget franchise action films. “Sometimes - like (when) they didn’t see you for Liberace - you’ve got to shake them up a little bit and have some fun,” Douglas said of surprising both studios and audiences with his decision to do a superhero film. Walt Disney Co’s foray in bringing Marvel’s superhero universe to the big screen has proved to be a lucrative choice, with films such as “Avengers” and “Iron Man 3” crossing the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office.

Billboard said “Frozen” is the first soundtrack to claim the top spot for consecutive weeks since “Dreamgirls” in 2007. The soundtrack has been helped by the film’s box office popularity, Billboard said, citing sources. The film has grossed $319 million at the domestic box office since its November release.

583,DIS,"Sony, Warner Bros. lead studios in nominations for Oscar gold","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Sony Pictures Entertainment and Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros. led Hollywood studios competing for Academy Awards with 21 nominations each, grabbing publicity that could provide a box office bounce for their contending films including “American Hustle” and “Gravity.” The recognition on Thursday from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was especially sweet for Sony, which came under heavy criticism in 2013 from activist investor Daniel Loeb after two big-budget bombs over the summer. On Thursday, Sony’s quirky tale of 1970s corruption “American Hustle” tied with Warner Bros. space thriller “Gravity” for the most nominations with 10 each. Both will compete in the best picture race, along with Sony’s hostage drama “Captain Phillips” and Warner Bros. computer-age romance “Her.” One young producer, 27-year-old Megan Ellison, solidified her stature in Hollywood, grabbing two nominations for backing “American Hustle” and “Her.” Ellison, the daughter of billionaire Oracle Corp co-founder Larry Ellison, runs production company Annapurna Pictures, which also produced a Sony nominee last year, “Zero Dark Thirty.” Ellison is only the fourth person, and the first woman, to earn two best picture nominations in the same year. The other films competing for the best picture statue are “12 Years a Slave” from 20th Century Fox; “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Nebraska” from Viacom Inc’s Paramount Pictures; “Dallas Buyers Club” from Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures; and “Philomena” from the privately held Weinstein Company. Nominations invariably prompt an uptick in ticket sales for movies that are still playing in theaters, as studios are quick to roll out updated TV spots and plaster the news elsewhere. When Warner Brothers’ Oscar-winning film “Argo” was nominated last year for the award, ticket sales jumped by 59 percent the next weekend, according to movie tracking service Rentrak. In 2012 the Weinstein Company put its film “the Artist” into 446 more theaters the weekend after the movie won a Golden Globe award, making it a front runner for the Oscar. Ticket sales nearly doubled. The film went on to win an Oscar. The Weinstein Company added another 235 theaters three days after “The Artist” was nominated for an Academy Award, increasing ticket sales by another 40 percent. “The nominations give studios new life for a film that may have played out and is headed for DVD,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Rentrak. “That’s why they spend so much money to get the nomination. They get it back.” For Sony, the nominations could particularly boost “American Hustle,” which earned nods in all four acting categories and will play nationwide this weekend. “American Hustle” and “Captain Phillips,” two modestly budgeted films, have already earned a combined $343 million around the world. The successes follow Sony’s 2013 summer flops, “After Earth” and “White House Down.” Warner Bros., hoping to capitalize on the Oscar nomination buzz, is expanding “Gravity” to 944 theaters on Friday from 155 last weekend. The film has already collected $675 million around the world. “Her,” was released in just six theaters on December 18., according to the site Box Office Mojo, allowing it to qualify for this year’s Oscar race. This weekend, it will be in more than 1,700 theaters. Weinstein Co, well-known for its intense post-nomination marketing strategy, pulled in 11 nominations, including the best picture nod for “Philomena” and two acting nominations for “August: Osage County.” The studio released “August: Osage County” in five theaters on December 27. This weekend, it will be in more than 900 theaters. Walt Disney Co’s movie studio earned eight nominations. “Frozen,” from Walt Disney Animation Studios, will compete in the best animated film category. Critically acclaimed Disney drama “Saving Mr. Banks” received one nomination, for original score. The Oscars will be awarded in a March 2 ceremony televised live on ABC.

585,DIS,Disney to lay off hundreds in gaming unit: report,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is preparing to lay off several hundred people in its interactive unit, the division that includes gaming products and the Disney.com website, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The layoffs are expected to begin after Disney releases its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, the Journal said. Playdom, a social gaming business Disney acquired in 2010, is one division expected to see cutbacks, the newspaper said. Disney is trying to turn around the interactive unit, which has about 3,000 employees. Its new Infinity video game enjoyed strong initial sales after its release last August, helping the division report a $16 million profit for the quarter that ended in September, an improvement from the $76 million loss a year earlier. A Disney spokeswoman had no comment. ",2032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-layoffs/disney-to-lay-off-hundreds-in-gaming-unit-report-idUSBREA121OJ20140203

587,DIS,Hit movies expected to boost Disney quarterly results,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Wall Street expects two new princesses and a muscular Marvel superhero to help lift Walt Disney Co’s quarterly results, as the company reaps the benefits of strong performances from film sequel “Thor: The Dark World” and animated musical mega-hit “Frozen.” On Wednesday, the media and theme park operator is forecast to report $1.6 billion in net income for the December quarter, a 14 percent gain from a year earlier, according to the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. They expect earnings of 91 cents a share. Disney’s movie studio helped boost the results, analysts said, with big box office grosses for “Frozen” and “Thor.” The story of royal sisters in an icy kingdom, “Frozen” is the fourth-highest grossing animated film released by Disney, so far collecting $868 million worldwide. “It is just blowing everyone away with how successful it is, how popular it is and how profitable we think it will be,” said FBR Capital Markets & Co analyst Barton Crockett, who rates Disney “outperform.” Crockett on January 29 increased his Disney earnings estimate for the December quarter by 6 cents to 91 cents per share, partly due to the unexpected strength of “Frozen.” Before it opened in November, he expected the film would gross about $200 million. He now expects it will approach $1 billion. Cowen & Co analyst Doug Creutz raised his quarterly revenue estimates for Disney last week by $180 million to $12.54 billion, primarily on higher estimates for the movie division. He forecasts the studio will generate $362 million in operating income this quarter, up 55 percent from $234 million a year ago. “Thor: The Dark World,” a Marvel sequel about the god of thunder, has sold $635 million worth of tickets worldwide. With “Frozen,” the two have surpassed a combined $1.5 billion. Disney’s latest crop of films followed an overhaul that Chief Executive Bob Iger ordered in 2010. The studio began focusing on a smaller number of films from the Disney, Pixar and Marvel brands that had the potential to become franchises that bring in box office receipts, spawn movie sequels, drive toy sales and inspire theme-park rides. In 2013, Disney’s movies collected $1.7 billion worth of tickets at U.S. and Canadian theaters, just behind the $1.9 billion for industry leader Warner Bros., according to Box Office Mojo. Disney’s returns came from 17 films, half as many as the 34 for Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc. Disney released three of last year’s top six films. “Iron Man 3” was the year’s second-bestselling film, with $409 million. Number four, “Frozen” has sold nearly $359 million in the United States. “Monsters University” was sixth with $268 million. “Frozen” also marked the reemergence of Walt Disney Animation Studios, the company’s traditional animation arm that had fallen behind the films produced by the company’s Pixar unit, which Iger acquired in 2006 for $7.4 billion. Disney’s studio also aggressively used characters from Marvel, the comic book and toy company it acquired in 2009 for $4 billion. It bought back the rights to “Iron Man” and “Thor” from Viacom’s Paramount studio. Marvel helped the company make good on Iger’s pledge to make films from which Disney could produce TV shows, sell toys and create rides. It created the TV show “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” for ABC based on its 2012 blockbuster “Marvel’s The Avengers,” the industry’s third-largest film with $1.5 billion in worldwide ticket sales. But focusing on a smaller number of larger-budget flicks has a clear downside. The company produced a dud in big-budget Western “The Lone Ranger” starring Johnny Depp as sidekick Tonto. Disney said in August it would lose up to $190 million on the film. With fewer films, “if they all hit, you are going to have great results,” analyst Creutz said. “The problem is, if one of them misses, you don’t have a lot of other places to make them up.” ",2042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-studio/hit-movies-expected-to-boost-disney-quarterly-results-idUSBREA131Q020140204

The film, a tale of two Scandinavian princess sisters forced to save their kingdom from an everlasting winter, also raked in $9.3 million at the box office last weekend with its new sing-along version.

595,DIS,UPDATE 2-CBS wins bid to air eight Thursday night NFL football games,"By Ronald Grover  and Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The CBS television network won a bidding war to air eight Thursday night National Football League games during the 2014 season, giving it one of the most highly prized programs on a night coveted by TV advertisers. CBS and the NFL announced the deal on Wednesday. CBS, which competed against the NBC and Fox networks, ESPN and Turner Broadcasting System, had been considered a long shot at the outset of the bidding because of its strong Thursday night lineup, which includes TV’s leading comedy “The Big Bang Theory,” and ratings mainstay “Two and A Half Men.” The bidding was less than $300 million for the single-season contract, which includes a one-year option at the NFL’s choice, according to a person with knowledge of the bids. Prices were lower than they might have been for such a prized property because the CBS games will simultaneously telecast on the NFL Network. “This is about making a strong night even stronger,” said CBS Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves in an interview with Reuters. “This adds 32 great hours at a pretty reasonable price.” Moonves said the NFL games, which will be telecast early in the coming season, give CBS the ability to use its strong Thursday programs on other nights and help new shows gain an audience. The network’s regular Thursday night lineup likely would start around Nov. 1, he said. The deal gives CBS the opportunity to do more things in the future with the NFL, Moonves said, although he said there are no plans for CBS to operate the NFL Network or for the games to migrate to the CBS Sports Network cable channel. “This was about helping to build the NFL brand on Thursday nights and the NFL Network,” he said. “This was about putting those games on a broadcast network.” CBS, a unit of CBS Corp, already broadcasts NFL games on Sunday afternoon. Bids were also submitted by NBC, owned by Comcast Corp  ; Fox ; ESPN, owned by Walt Disney Co ; and TBS, owned by Time Warner, according to the person with knowledge of the bids. Shares of CBS were up 0.8 percent at $58.34 in afternoon trading.

596,DIS,"US STOCKS-Wall St rallies on labor market data, earnings","* Initial jobless claims decline more than expected * Twitter slumps after results; LinkedIn off after the bell * Green Mountain surges on deal with Coca-Cola * Indexes up: Dow 1.22 pct, S&P; 1.24 pct, Nasdaq 1.14 pct By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Feb 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted their best day of the year on Thursday after a drop in applications for unemployment insurance boosted confidence in the economy and Disney’s results overshot expectations. The rally came ahead of the widely-followed payrolls report for January due Friday, which some are expecting to be affected by the extreme weather that hit much of the United States. December’s number was a much-lower-than-expected 74,000 and an upward revision wouldn’t be a surprise. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 20,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 331,000. While the data has no direct bearing on January’s employment report it bodes well for the jobs market and the overall economy. “Investors recently have been choosing to look at the glass half empty data and not focus on the positives,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “Bad weather causes cancellations, flight problems, business closings. I’m hoping we get an upward revision to the December (payrolls) number tomorrow, but if we get a lousy number I’m not going to crawl under a rock.” Recent soft data added to jitters about growth in China and a selloff in emerging market currencies and stocks. But a near 6 percent decline on the S&P; 500 from its record high last month to the session low Wednesday was seen by some as a buying opportunity, as earnings continue to grow. Walt Disney was the most recent bellwether to beat expectations as its profit topped estimates, sending its shares up 5.3 percent to $75.56. Disney led gains on both the Dow industrials and S&P; 500. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 330 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 68.8 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, above the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 67 percent rate for the past four quarters. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 188.3 points or 1.22 percent, to 15,628.53, the S&P; 500 gained 21.79 points or 1.24 percent, to 1,773.43 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 45.57 points or 1.14 percent, to 4,057.122. It was the largest daily percentage gain for the S&P; 500 and Dow since mid-December. However, the S&P; was on track for its fourth consecutive negative week, a streak not seen since July-August of 2011. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street, surged 26.2 percent to $102.10. Coca-Cola bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25 billion and said it would help launch Green Mountain’s new cold drink machine.

The rally comes ahead of the widely-followed payrolls report due Friday, which some are expecting to be affected by the extreme cold weather that has hit much of the United States. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 20,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 331,000. While the data has no direct bearing on January’s employment report, as it falls outside the survey period, it bodes well for the jobs market and the overall economy. “Investors recently have been choosing to look at the glass half empty data and not focus on the positives,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “Bad weather causes cancellations, flight problems, business closings. I’m hoping we get an upward revision to the December (payrolls) number tomorrow, but if we get a lousy number I’m not going to crawl under a rock.” The recent soft data added to jitters about growth in China and a selloff in emerging market currencies and stocks. But a near 6 percent decline on the S&P; 500 was seen by some as a buying opportunity, as earnings continue to grow. Walt Disney was the most recent bellwether to beat expectations as its profit topped estimates, sending its shares up 5.4 percent to $75.61. Disney led gains on both the Dow industrials and S&P; 500. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 330 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 68.8 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, above the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 67 percent rate for the past four quarters. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 178.66 points or 1.16 percent, to 15,618.89, the S&P; 500 gained 21.4 points or 1.22 percent, to 1,773.04 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 48.395 points or 1.21 percent, to 4,059.947. Despite the gains, the S&P; 500 was on track for its fourth consecutive negative week, something it hasn’t done since July-August of 2011. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street, surged 29.6 percent to $104.85 as the top boost to the Nasdaq 100 index. Coca-Cola  bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25 billion and said it would help launch Green Mountain’s new cold drink machine. Coke shares gained 1.2 percent to $38.08 while home beverage device maker SodaStream International rose 10.4 percent to $39.50. The Nasdaq also received a boost from Akamai Technologies , which soared 19.9 percent to $56.91 after forecasting better-than-expected results. Bucking the bullish trend, Spirit AeroSystems shares fell 21.1 percent to $26. The major supplier of components to Boeing and Airbus, reported a quarterly loss on charges tied mainly to the Boeing 787 program. Also on the downside, Twitter reported slow user growth, dimming hopes the company could sustain its quick expansion and sending shares down 22.2 percent to $51.34. On the other hand, Yelp added more customers, allowing it to report better-than-expected quarterly revenue after the bell on Wednesday. Its shares jumped 19.4 percent to $89.80. Other economic data showed the U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in December as exports fell, which could see the advance fourth-quarter growth estimate trimmed.

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, in a boost to the labor market outlook and the broader economy. Walt Disney Co shares climbed 5.4 percent to $75.61 to lead both the Dow and S&P; 500 higher after the media company’s quarterly profit topped Wall Street expectations. “Disney is up strong on good earnings. You’ve got a number of names bouncing back here,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. As the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to wind down its stimulus, investors have turned their focus to fundamentals such as corporate earnings and economic data. However, many participants have reservations whether the recent soft data truly reflects the economy or is the result of a harsh winter. Friday’s payrolls report may not provide a clearer indication of the economy’s health after last month’s disappointing number. “All eyes are on tomorrow’s employment report number, although whatever it is, it’s going to be quickly dismissed because of weather. People will say it’s either overstated or understated,” said Ghriskey. Twitter Inc shares tumbled 19.6 percent to $53.01  after the social media reported slow user growth, dimming hopes the company could sustain its torrid expansion. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc surged 27.1 percent to $102.80 as the top boost to the Nasdaq 100  index. Coca-Cola Co bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25 billion and said it would help launch Green Mountain’s new cold drink machine.

General Motors shed 0.3 percent to $34.98. The automaker posted weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Thursday as results in North America, Asia and South America disappointed. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc reported a 23 percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by higher sales at its Dunkin’ Donuts coffee and sandwich outlets. The company also boosted its quarterly dividend and announced a new $125 million share buyback plan. Its shares advanced 5.1 percent to $49.70.

Thirteen new episodes of “The Clone Wars” will premiere on Netflix on March 7. The five earlier seasons, which previously aired on Time Warner Inc’s Cartoon Network, also will be available on Netflix at that time, along with a feature film of the same name.

603,DIS,Massive cable deal would make Comcast too powerful for some,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumer advocates and U.S. lawmakers are worried that Comcast Corp’s proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc will create a company with too much power to decide what Americans can watch on television and do online, and they expect intense regulatory scrutiny of the deal. Their concerns are intertwined with a recent court decision to overturn U.S. open Internet rules, which enforced the principle that Internet service providers should treat all Web traffic equally and should not give preferential treatment to their own movies, websites and content. Comcast, a major provider of Internet services, is committed to network neutrality until 2018. Separately, some media companies are concerned that Comcast would attempt to pay them less for their television shows, movies and other content, and have scheduled discussions with their attorneys with an eye toward lobbying regulators in Washington, said an antitrust attorney who spoke privately to protect business relationships. Comcast’s proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable would combine the country’s top two cable providers into a colossus that could reshape the U.S. pay television and broadband Internet industry. The deal would put Comcast in 19 of the nation’s 20 largest TV markets. The deal will be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission and either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, the two agencies that share antitrust oversight in the United States. Eight antitrust experts interviewed by Reuters were split on whether the merger would be approved. While Comcast has agreed to divest 3 million Time Warner Cable subscribers to keep their combined share of the U.S. pay television market at under 30 percent, it is unclear if that is enough to satisfy antitrust regulators, the experts said. A Comcast-Time Warner combination could be especially troubling in light of the court ruling that struck down FCC rules aimed at preventing broadband service providers from favoring one website over another, said Bert Foer, head of the American Antitrust Institute. “I hope it (the deal) is going to be fought tooth and nail,” said Foer. “You’re creating this giant and you’re doing it in the absence of a network neutrality rule. That’s dangerous to democracy.” Foer said that agreements between Comcast and federal agencies that were put in place at the time of the Comcast and NBC Universal merger in 2011 to assure network neutrality would end in 2018 and were nothing more than a “short-term bandage.” The advocacy group Consumer Watchdog bluntly called on the FCC and Department of Justice to block the creation of “an unjustifiable monopoly” that could raise prices to customers and would have “no incentive to improve broadband service.” Antitrust authorities often challenge mergers or extract concessions when head-to-head competition would be diluted, although there are few areas of the United States where two cable companies compete directly. Reed Hundt, FCC chairman during the Clinton administration, said the current spotlight on the issue of open internet principles meant the commission would carefully examine the size and power of the new combined company. “The FCC will look at that broadband market share and they will say, ‘Chairman Wheeler promised an open internet, what does this deal mean for that?’” he said. “The FCC will take a hard look at what is the durable, long-lasting, truly open internet commitment,” Hundt said. Robert McDowell, a former FCC commissioner who voted to approve Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal, said the company could be asked to extend its net neutrality commitment, and if they do so, chances of approval are good. “Comcast understood going into this that they’ll have to agree to at least all of the same merger conditions that were put into the NBC merger deal plus some other things too. They will probably see an extension of the term of those conditions,” McDowell said. Amy Klobuchar, chairwoman of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, promised a hearing “to carefully scrutinize the details of this merger and its potential consequences.” No date has been set so far. The Republican-run House Judiciary Committee is also expected to hold a hearing “to ensure that the interests of American consumers and overall competition in the marketplace is protected.” Senator Al Franken was a critic of Comcast’s previous deal with NBC Universal. On Thursday he wrote to both FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and top U.S. antitrust officials with “serious reservations” about Comcast’s latest move. “A handful of cable providers dominate the market, leaving consumers with little choice but to pay high bills for often unsatisfactory service. I am concerned that Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner would only make things worse,” wrote Franken, a Minnesota Democrat. The Justice Department has stopped a couple of notable deals recently, particularly a proposed merger of AT&T; with T-Mobile USA. Other deals it sued to stop - like the Anheuser-Busch InBev deal to buy Grupo Modelo and US Airways merger with American Airlines - were allowed to go ahead after the companies pledged big asset sales. The companies maintain that customers will benefit from the merger as services and technology improves. “This transaction is pro-consumer, pro-competitive and approvable,” said Comcast executive vice president David Cohen. However, “we’re certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly,” he added. Wall Street analysts said the deal would give Comcast a stronger hand in negotiations with content providers such as Walt Disney Co, CBS Corp and Fox. Media companies collectively receive billions of dollars a year from pay TV operators for their programming. “Content providers would face a negotiating behemoth with close to 30 million subscribers that, oh by the way, is vertically integrated with a direct competitor (NBC Universal),” Moffett Nathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note to clients. “Expect them to complain vehemently.” A Disney spokesman did not respond to requests for comment, and Fox had no comment. CBS’ chief executive Les Moonves said in a CNBC interview that “if you have the right content, you’re always going to have the (pricing) power.” The deal has generated “considerable opposition” among programmers who fear they will be offered less money for their content, said the antitrust attorney. “This is a very problematic deal. ... And I don’t know if it can be corrected,” he said.

Two new entries cracked the top 10 of the Billboard 200 chart this week. Country artist Cole Swindell landed at No. 3 with his latest self-titled record, while rock group Issues came in at No. 9 with its self-titled album. Overall album sales for the week ending Feb. 23 totaled 4.8 million units, Billboard said, down 12 percent from the comparable week in 2013.

609,DIS,PepsiCo re-enters 'Magic Kingdom' with Shanghai Disney deal,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc PEP.N has signed a deal to supply beverages to Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) first China resort, breaking The Coca-Cola Co’s (KO.N) quarter century monopoly over beverage supply to the U.S. theme park operator. PepsiCo and its partner in China, Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp (0322.HK), will exclusively provide beverages to the Shanghai Disney Resort, its first on mainland China which is set to open at the end of 2015, PepsiCo, Disney and Tingyi said in a joint statement on Thursday. Coca-Cola has had a long-standing tie-up with Disney, while it has been at least 25 years since PepsiCo last sold its beverages through the theme park chain, a Dubai-based PepsiCo spokesman said. The deal is only a tiny segment of China’s 421 billion yuan ($68.74 billion) soft drink sector, but marks a blow for PepsiCo against Coke in the highly competitive market, where both brands are coming under increasing pressure from Chinese rivals and changing consumer tastes for local flavors. “I wonder what kind of message it sends to Coke globally. Even though the Disney park is only one small thing, China has massive room to grow for the Disney brand. Tying up this deal could mean good things going forward,” said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group. Disney said it currently has no plans to ink similar deals with PepsiCo to supply its other resorts, although it is “actively pursuing opportunities in a variety of different sectors,” Murray King, vice president of public affairs for the Shanghai Disney Resort, said. The PepsiCo spokesman said he could not comment on whether PepsiCo and Disney planned other tie-ups. Disney has a further 11 theme parks and 44 resorts around the world, according to its official website. Coca-Cola edges the China market with a 15.7 percent share of China’s soft drinks market in 2012, ahead of PepsiCo’s 4.5 percent share by off-trade volume, according to data from Euromonitor. China’s soft drinks sector is worth around 421 billion yuan ($69.12 billion). Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for healthier alternatives in food and drink, which has also hit growth for fast food chains such as McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N). Coca-Cola remains the soft drinks supplier for Disney resorts outside mainland China. It is the beverage provider for Disney’s 11 parks in the United States, Hong Kong, France and Japan, a Singapore-based spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said. “The Coca-Cola Company and The Walt Disney Company share a long-standing partnership that dates to the first Disney television show in 1950 and the first Disneyland theme park in 1955. Today, our global partnership with Disney is as strong as ever,” she added in emailed comments to Reuters. Though it retains the biggest market share in China, but local rivals are catching up. Pepsi’s partner in the market, Taiwanese Tingyi, raised its market share from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 12.8 percent in 2012, according to Euromonitor. Tingyi and PepsiCo beverages will be the sole range of drinks sold at the Shanghai park, a Tingyi spokesman said. All three companies declined to put a value on the deal. The key question for Pepsi is if it can leverage its tie-up with Disney outside the limits of the resort, said Cavender. “If they can do more Disney-themed adverts elsewhere I can see this benefiting them a lot, and the fact Disney switched from Coke to Pepsi here could mean big things for the years ahead in other markets too,” he said.

610,DIS,Oscar favorite 'Frozen' leads red-hot animation field,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The first Academy Award for an animated feature film was a special honor given to Walt Disney in 1939 for the innovation of “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” Child actress Shirley Temple presented Disney with a full-sized gold Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones. The studio founded by the animation pioneer, Walt Disney Animation Studios, has never won the Oscar for best animated feature, a category created in 2002. That is expected to change on Sunday, as the studio’s hit “Frozen” is the favorite in a race that has become as diverse as Hollywood’s animation industry. “Frozen” will compete for Oscar gold with films that include box office hits “The Croods,” a caveman comedy from DreamWorks Animation SKG, and the yellow minions of Universal Pictures’ “Despicable Me 2,” produced by relative newcomer Illumination Entertainment. “It’s a tremendously vibrant competitive landscape,” said Illumination Chief Executive Officer Chris Meledandri. A larger number of players creating high-quality animated films helps everyone in the business, he said, because it raises enthusiasm for the genre and brings a wider group of people to theaters beyond the typical family filmgoers. “Audiences remain urgently interested in the medium,” Meledandri said. “It continues to expand our collective audience.” Last year, five studios including Walt Disney Co’s famed Pixar unit distributed animated films that generated $100 million or more at U.S. and Canadian theaters, six if Disney Animation Studios and Pixar are counted separately. This year, the biggest movie at the domestic box office is Warner Bros’ animated “The Lego Movie,” which has earned nearly $280 million worldwide in three weeks. Another animated film, “The Nut Job” from Open Road Films, a joint venture of theater chains AMC Entertainment and Regal Entertainment, ranks third on domestic charts this year. Animated films also draw crowds of moviegoers in foreign markets that are increasingly important to Hollywood. “The opportunities and interest and appetite for animation around the world is very big,” DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg said. “These are great stories. They are appreciated everywhere they go, and they go everywhere.” The three biggest box office hits among this year’s animated Oscar contenders - “Frozen,” “Despicable Me 2” and “The Croods” - have rung up more than $2.5 billion in worldwide ticket sales combined. Two smaller films, “The Wind Rises” from Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki and French-language entry “Ernest & Celestine,” round out the nominees. Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros, the studio built with the help of Bugs Bunny and other Looney Tunes characters, had not been a major player in big-screen animation since its 2006 Oscar winner “Happy Feet.” A year ago, the studio announced it created an animation consortium with the goal of releasing one animated feature a year, starting with “The Lego Movie.” A “Lego” sequel is now planned for 2017. “The Lego Movie has fueled our excitement to create more animated films,” said Greg Silverman, president of creative development and worldwide production for Warner Bros. Studios gravitate toward animated films because the big ones become franchises that produce characters that yield revenues beyond the box office. On Monday, DreamWorks announced plans for live entertainment “Shrek” attractions in six cities. The musical soundtrack for “Frozen” and Oscar-nominated anthem “Let It Go” by Idina Menzel have sold more than 1 million copies each. With so many studios jostling for screens at the movie theaters, not every animated film succeeded. DreamWorks’ 2013 release “Turbo,” which generated $83 million in domestic ticket sales, forced it to take a $13.5 million impairment charge, the company said on Tuesday. “Turbo faced one of the most competitive feature film environments we have seen,” DreamWorks CEO Katzenberg said on a conference call with industry analysts. “Frozen,” which has generated more than $980 million in worldwide ticket sales, cemented a resurgence for Walt Disney Animation Studios, which despite Disney’s rich history in animation became overshadowed by its corporate sibling, Pixar. The studio founded by Steve Jobs has won seven Oscars in 12 years for blockbusters including “Finding Nemo,” “Up” and “Brave.” This year, Pixar was shut out of the Oscar nominations for the second time in three years. The filmmakers behind “Frozen,” the story of royal sisters in an icy kingdom, sought to build on Disney’s legacy of classic musical fairy tales, said Andrew Millstein, executive vice president and general manager of Walt Disney Animation Studios. The genre had fallen out of favor since 1990s Disney hits like “Beauty and the Beast” and “The Lion King.” “We felt there was a real hunger for these kind of stories,” he said, ones that had a “timelessness and relevance” and were also “heartfelt, comedic, with great music.” Illumination scored its first two Oscar nominations for “Despicable Me 2,” for animated feature and original song for Pharrell Williams’ “Happy.” The film was made for $76 million, half of what Disney spent on “Frozen.” Working with a lower budget fueled creativity, Illumination CEO Meledandri said, because the filmmakers did not need to worry about reeling in outsized box office returns. “We were able to take certain risks that we would not have been able to take if there were twice as much financial pressure on us,” he said. “Despicable 2” became a blockbuster with $970 million in global ticket sales. Comcast Corp’s Universal plans to release three Illumination films through 2017, including a “Despicable” sequel and a remake of Dr. Seuss classic “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” Once the Oscars are over, a new parade of animated offerings will begin, starting with DreamWorks’ “Mr. Peabody & Sherman” on March 7. Other coming releases are DreamWorks’ “How to Train Your Dragon 2,” a “Rio” sequel from Fox, and “Big Hero 6” from Disney Animation. Even DisneyToon Studios, a unit that specialized in direct-to-DVD films, is gearing up to hit the big screen again. Its “Planes: Fire and Rescue,” a sequel to last year’s hit film “Planes,” is scheduled for release on July 18.

614,DIS,Fake emergency alert in movie ad draws fines for U.S. media firms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. advertisement for a movie that sounded like an emergency alert has drawn fines of $1.9 million for media companies Viacom Inc and Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal and ESPN, co-controlled by Walt Disney Co. after viewer complaints. The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it found the three companies “apparently willfully and repeatedly violated” the rules that prohibit the use of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) sounds for purposes other than to warn viewers of national emergencies. Several consumers had complained about the trailer for the movie “The Olympus Has Fallen” shown on the television channels Comedy Central, ESPN and SyFy in March of 2013. The FCC review confirmed that the 30-second ad for the movie used portions of EAS codes and alert signals, accompanied by text “this is not a test” and “this is not a drill,” which caused “the transmission of false distress signals.” Viacom now faces $1.1 million in penalties for airing the ad 108 times on seven of its channels; NBCUniversal faces a charge of $530,000 for showing the trailer 38 times on seven of its cable networks; and ESPN faces a penalty of $280,000 for showing the promo 13 times on three of its networks. During the investigation, Viacom and NBCUniversal had argued they were not liable for the promos and were not subject to the FCC’s rules on EAS signals as they were not participants in the EAS program. The regulators disagreed. The EAS is a national public warning system that ensures the U.S. president could address all Americans during a national emergency and allows federal, state, and local authorities to deliver emergency information, such as Amber Alerts about missing children or tornado warnings. The FCC has been going after EAS violators following what it says has been a recent spike in consumer complaints. In November, the agency proposed a similar $25,000 fine to Turner Broadcasting, a cable unit of Time Warner Inc, for a promo for the Conan O’Brien comedy show on TBS.

The animated feature category was created in 2002 and has been dominated by Disney-owned Pixar, which has won it seven times but was shut out of the nominations this year for the second time in three years. “Frozen” cemented a resurgence for Disney Animation Studios, becoming a global phenomenon with over $1 billion in movie theater ticket sales, according to Rentrak.

620,DIS,UPDATE 3-Dish eyes Internet TV services in landmark Disney deal,"By Liana B. Baker and Varun Aggarwal March 4 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp and Walt Disney Co have reached a long-term programming deal, allowing the No. 2 satellite TV provider to carry Disney-owned networks such as ABC and ESPN and deliver the content outside of a traditional TV subscription. The deal announced Monday marks the first time that a U.S. pay-TV operator was given flexibility by a media company to offer its content over the Web through smartphones, tablets and computers. Until now, content owners had not granted cable or satellite TV operators the digital rights to sell their shows outside of a pay-TV subscription. “The Dish/Disney deal appears to set the stage for a new wave of broadband-delivered video services,” said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. The companies said Dish gets the right to stream “linear and video on demand content” from channels such as ABC broadcast stations and cable networks such as Disney Channel and ESPN as part of an internet-delivered IP-based multichannel offering. “Disney comes out a winner” because its new college football  network gets national distribution through the deal and it settled an area of conflict regarding Dish’s commercial-skipping digital video recorder (DVR), MoffettNathanson Research analyst Michael Nathanson said. Disney shares rose 3.1 percent to $82.00 leading the Dow Jones Industrial average. It was “one of the most complex and comprehensive” deals it has ever undertaken, said Anne Sweeney, co-chairwoman of Disney Media Networks. Dish did not provide details on its potential TV subscription over the Internet, but a big market is likely waiting for such a product. North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on entertainment from over-the-top services such as Netflix, more than twice what they spent in 2010, according to PwC’s annual entertainment and media forecast. Sony Corp has been working on an Internet TV service that is expected to come out this year. Intel Corp’s  efforts to launch one was recently bought by Verizon Communications Inc. Dish chairman Charlie Ergen has talked about the need to suit viewer’s changing habits and acknowledged that a small but growing number of customers are “cutting the cord” or cancelling traditional TV and just subscribing to internet service. Ergen ruffled the feathers of broadcasters by rolling out a service called AutoHop that lets viewers automatically skip commercials on recorded programming on its DVRs, but discontinued the service for ABC programming as part of the deal. AutoHop sparked a lawsuit between the two companies. Disney and Dish’s programming agreement expired at the end of September, but they averted a blackout of Disney’s top networks for the satellite provider’s 14 million customers. The deal will result in dismissal of all pending litigation between the two, including disputes over PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop, the companies said in a statement. The deal includes digital rights for mobile apps such as Watch ESPN and Watch ABC. Dish will carry Fusion, a new English-language news channel aimed at young adults and the SEC Network, a college sports network from ESPN launching later in 2014. Dish, like its larger rival DirecTV, does not offer broadband Internet service like cable companies so it has been experimenting with ways to adapt. DirecTV CEO Mike White has said the No. 1 satellite operator is working on an “over-the-top” video package to suit niche audiences such as Hispanic or kids programming, but hasn’t given details on that product yet.",3042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/dish-disney/update-3-dish-eyes-internet-tv-services-in-landmark-disney-deal-idUSL1N0M10G720140304

Putin also ordered troops involved in a military exercise near the Ukrainian border back to their bases as he sought to ease tensions a day after Russian stocks, bonds and currency were hammered. Investors’ flight to safety was reversed on Tuesday, with global stocks higher while gold, the Japanese yen and Treasuries prices fell. Crude oil prices, up more than 2 percent on Monday on Russia’s standing as top exporter, reversed some of last session’s gain. “In the short term, the market always over reacts,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “We got marginally good news today but we don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.” Forrest said she expects volatility to return to the market as the situation in Ukraine remains fluid. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 192.01 points or 1.19 percent, to 16,360.04, the S&P; 500 gained 24.33 points or 1.32 percent, to 1,870.06 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 71.772 points or 1.68 percent, to 4,349.073. The S&P; hit an intraday record of 1,871.44 while the Nasdaq Composite touched a 14-year high.

Putin said there was no need to use military force in the Crimea region of Ukraine for now, a day after Russian stocks, bonds and currency were hammered as a result of Moscow’s military move on the peninsula. “This is a done deal; if it was escalating, it would have by now,” said Doug Cote, chief market strategist, ING U.S. Investment Management in New York. In the absence of a grave crisis, geopolitical risks tend to be short lived as leaders succumb to market forces, he said. “The market is back to fundamentals. Earnings have been fabulous for the fourth quarter. This market is going up because fundamentals are positive.” The geopolitical tension triggered a run for investment safety on Monday, with gold, the U.S. dollar and Treasuries prices up and stocks around the world lower. The move was partly reversing on Tuesday. S&P; 500 e-mini futures rose 19 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 166 points and Nasdaq 100 futures added 38 points. The sharp gains in futures indicated the S&P; 500 would be trading near record high levels. The turbulent situation in Ukraine set the ground for volatile trading ahead. Shares of RadioShack Corp tumbled 23 percent in premarket trading after the struggling retailer said it would close up to 1,100 stores in the United States after a huge drop in sales over the holidays. Dish Network and Walt Disney Co reached a long-term deal, allowing the No.2 satellite TV provider to carry Disney-owned networks such as ABC and ESPN, and deliver the content outside of a traditional TV subscription.

628,DIS,"Disney overhauls troubled interactive unit, lays off 700","LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Walt Disney overhauled its struggling interactive division in a sweeping reorganization that will reduce the number of video games it develops and alter its advertising strategy to focus more on the fast-changing mobile market. As part of the revamp, Disney will lay off 700 employees, roughly one-quarter of the interactive division, according to a person with knowledge of the layoffs. A Disney spokeswoman would not confirm the number. Disney’s games and online division has for years been a persistent money loser and a small but significant drag on a corporate empire that spans movie-making and television to cable network ESPN, theme parks and cruise lines. As with other major game publishing houses, Disney has been trying to keep up with rapidly shifting consumer preferences and an explosion in mobile gaming worldwide. In 2010, it bought mobile game developer Playdom for over $500 million, an acquisition that has yet to bear significant fruit. “We are trying to consolidate things and focus largely on the mobile platform,” the president of Disney Interactive, Jimmy Pitaro, said in an interview with Reuters. “The industry is moving very quickly in that direction and we’re making that transition.” Last year, Disney Interactive lost $87 million as revenues rose 26 percent from 2012; the division has lost a total in recent years of more than $1 billion. In Disney’s fiscal first quarter that ended on December 28, the unit reported $55 million in operating income. Disney now plans to license most of its games to earn additional revenue, Pitaro said. It will continue to develop games and content for its “Infinity” platform, a combination video game and toy line; it has sold more than 3 million copies of the platform globally since its August release. That line, which echoes Activision Blizzard Inc’s “Skylanders” product, is viewed as a pivotal element in Disney’s effort to revive the interactive division. Disney will continue to make kid-friendly mobile games and short videos for YouTube, Disney.com and elsewhere, Pitaro said. The company also intends to adjust its online strategy and streamline its diverse websites. It will close two smaller sites, Spoonful.com and BabyZone.com, and revamp Disney.com to use its primary website more as a promotional site for its retail, parks and other businesses. Disney will continue to generate advertising revenues from Disney.com and will increase the amount of content it produces in conjunction with sponsors, Pitaro said. For instance, Disney produced a 38-minute video with Google called “Blank: A Vinylmation Love Story.” In December, it announced it would make a series of animated shorts with Rosetta Stone that Pitaro said would be the model for future joint efforts.

632,DIS,"Walt Disney, Shanghai Media Group to develop Disney-branded movies","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Studios has signed an agreement with Shanghai Media Group Pictures to develop Disney-branded movies, the latest move by a U.S. studio to grow its presence in China’s entertainment business. U.S.-based writers will team up with local writers and filmmakers to develop stories and scripts that incorporate Chinese themes in Disney movies, the studio said in a statement. (link.reuters.com/mur47v) The studio said the multi-year partnership with Shanghai Media will expand training opportunities between Chinese and American writers and filmmakers. Tony To, the studio’s executive vice president of production, will oversee the co-development program, which could allow for easier releases of English-language films in China. A 37-member Film Censorship Committee vets every movie in China for nudity, violence and politically sensitive scenes. Western films in addition must meet the committee’s “amendment opinions” to be one of the 34 Hollywood films permitted in China each year. Last year, Disney’s superhero film “Iron Man 3” debuted in China and included a top Chinese actress and footage shot in China, additions that helped the film ease past strict censors and often confusing rules for Western films. In February, the official Xinhua news agency reported that China will maintain its quota for imported Hollywood movies this year, rejecting reports it had planned to increase access for U.S. films to the world’s second-largest cinema market. Production companies like Viacom Inc’s Paramount Picture and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc have hired Chinese actors and set up co-productions with Chinese firms. China’s entertainment and media market is estimated to grow to $148 billion by 2015 from around $120 billion in 2013, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ outlook for the global entertainment and media business 2011-2015. In 2012, Disney was named founding partner of a National Chinese Animation Creative Research and Development Project - an initiative to advance China’s animation industry and train local talent and promote the development of Chinese content and franchises. Walt Disney Co and BesTV New Media, the digital media unit of the Shanghai Media Group, formed a joint venture in China in December 2013, to provide entertainment using both companies’ technical and marketing expertise.

Sweeney, also co-chair of Disney Media Networks, oversees the ABC broadcast network, ABC Studios and cable networks including the Disney Channels and ABC Family. The former Fox and Nickelodeon executive joined Disney in 1996 and played a key role in implementing Chief Executive Bob Iger’s digital strategy. In 2005, she led negotiations with Apple Inc that enabled Disney to become the first Hollywood studio to license its movies for download from Apple’s iTunes store. On March 3, Disney licensed the digital rights for ESPN, the Disney Channel and other properties to satellite operator Dish Networks Inc, allowing it to become the first pay television operator to distribute TV shows online outside of a traditional TV subscription. Sweeney, 56, said she wanted to explore a more creative job in the television business. “There has always been a nagging voice in the back of my head pushing me to step out of the comfort zone of the executive ranks and more directly into the creative arena that enticed me to TV in the first place,” she said in a statement. “I finally listened to that voice and thought, ‘If not now, when?’” Iger, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, said he had offered Sweeney a multi-year contract extension. “She shocked me by saying she didn’t really want to go long, that she was thinking about her life and exploring other things,” he said. Iger said he would look for a replacement quickly, aiming to have someone in place during the TV pilot season that runs through May. “My goal is to do it fast,” he said. The CEO also expressed confidence in ABC Entertainment Group President Paul Lee, who was hired to run the network in 2010. ABC has struggled in the ratings, ranking fourth so far this season among the major broadcasters in overall viewers and in the 18 to 49 age group prized by advertisers, according to Nielsen. Lee “has got my full support,” Iger said, adding that “he and I share the (belief that) we’d love a few more hits at ABC.” “By the way, there are elements of prime time that we’re quite happy about,” Iger said, mentioning political drama “Scandal” and business reality show “Shark Tank.” ",3112014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-sweeney/disney-tv-executive-sweeney-to-leave-company-in-january-idUSBREA2A1P220140311

639,DIS,Disney TV executive Sweeney to leave company in January,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Anne Sweeney, the president of Walt Disney Co’s Disney/ABC Television Group, will leave the media company in January after 18 years to pursue a career in television directing, the company said on Tuesday. Sweeney, also co-chair of Disney Media Networks, oversees the ABC broadcast network, ABC Studios and cable networks including the Disney Channels and ABC Family. The former Fox and Nickelodeon executive joined Disney in 1996 and played a key role in implementing Chief Executive Bob Iger’s digital strategy. In 2005, she led negotiations with Apple Inc that enabled Disney to become the first Hollywood studio to license its movies for download from Apple’s iTunes store. On March 3, Disney licensed the digital rights for ESPN, the Disney Channel and other properties to satellite operator Dish Networks Inc, allowing it to become the first pay television operator to distribute TV shows online outside of a traditional TV subscription. Sweeney, 56, said she wanted to explore a more creative job in the television business. “There has always been a nagging voice in the back of my head pushing me to step out of the comfort zone of the executive ranks and more directly into the creative arena that enticed me to TV in the first place,” she said in a statement. “I finally listened to that voice and thought, ‘If not now, when?’” Iger, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, said he had offered Sweeney a multi-year contract extension. “She shocked me by saying she didn’t really want to go long, that she was thinking about her life and exploring other things,” he said. Iger said he would look for a replacement quickly, aiming to have someone in place during the TV pilot season that runs through May. “My goal is to do it fast,” he said. The CEO also expressed confidence in ABC Entertainment Group President Paul Lee, who was hired to run the network in 2010. ABC has struggled in the ratings, ranking fourth so far this season among the major broadcasters in overall viewers and in the 18 to 49 age group prized by advertisers, according to Nielsen. Lee “has got my full support,” Iger said, adding that “he and I share the (belief that) we’d love a few more hits at ABC.” “By the way, there are elements of prime time that we’re quite happy about,” Iger said, mentioning political drama “Scandal” and business reality show “Shark Tank.” ",3122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-sweeney/disney-tv-executive-sweeney-to-leave-company-in-january-idUSBREA2A1P220140312
640,DIS,Disney faces latest investor proposal to nominate directors,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co shareholders are expected to vote at its March 18 annual meeting on a resolution that asks the company to allow large shareholders to nominate board members, the latest bid by investor groups to win “proxy access” rights. The Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds and the California State Teachers Retirement System proposed that the board allow owners of at least 3 percent of the company’s stock be empowered to nominate up to 20 percent of the board, according to a regulatory filing from Disney on January 24. Under the non-binding proxy access proposal, shareholders must own their stake for three years before they have nomination rights. The company’s shareholders rejected a similar proposal last year, with 40 percent voting in support. “Disney is a bellwether company and the vote will get a lot of attention,” said Robert McCormick, chief policy officer of proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, which has advised its clients to vote for the measure. This year, shareholders at as many as 20 companies will consider proxy access proposals, said Patrick McGurn, special counsel to proxy advisory firm ISS that has advised Disney shareholders to approve the measure. Of three shareholder votes so far this year, the non-binding proposal was adopted at slot machine maker International Game Technology and rejected at Apple Inc and Walgreen Co. On February 28, Apple shareholders soundly defeated such a measure, with only 4 percent of those casting votes in support of a non-binding resolution that would allow investors holding between 1 percent and 5 percent to nominate up to 24 percent of the board. Last year, 12 companies had the measure on their ballots, according to ISS, with shareholders at Verizon and CenturyLink approving proxy access. Among those who voted it down with Disney shareholders in 2013 were those at Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Staples and Netflix Inc. Proponents of the measure for the upcoming Disney meeting say the access to the nomination process would “more easily promote independent director candidates to enhance accountability to shareholders,” according to the regulatory filing from Disney. They cite the decision by Disney’s board to elevate Chief Executive Bob Iger in 2012 to the chairmanship as well as one reason the provision is needed. European institutional investor Legal & General Investment Management also supports the proposal. Disney’s board, which recommended shareholders vote against the proxy access proposal, said the company has in place “a well-defined process of shareholders to nominate directors” and bring to attention potential candidates to the nominating committee. In the last year, former Starbucks Chief Executive Orin Smith, Disney’s independent lead director, has met with many of the company’s largest shareholders, the board said in the filing.

642,DIS,RPT-INSIGHT-Growth in compensation for U.S. CEOs may have slowed,"By Ross Kerber BOSTON, March 17 (Reuters) - Big U.S. companies appear to have handed out smaller increases in compensation to their chief executives in 2013 than in 2012, mainly as a result of reduced grants of stock options, according to an early review of annual regulatory filings. Based on disclosures from 46 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that had filed annual compensation reports by March 11, the median compensation increase for a CEO was 1 percent to $8.64 million. That was a slower rate of increase than this group of 46 received for 2012 when its median CEO pay rose 15 percent to $8.53 million. The median compensation for CEOs in S&P; 500 companies overall increased about 5.5 percent for 2012. The review, conducted for Reuters by proxy adviser and corporate governance consulting firm Institutional Shareholder Services, provides an early peek at compensation trends but ISS cautioned that there could be significant changes once all companies have reported and that the 46 companies may not be  representative of trends for companies in the entire index. Most companies will file their executive compensation data over the next few weeks. Some pay experts have been expecting to see slower growth in compensation for 2013 - despite the bull market in stocks - as S&P; 500 corporate profits only increased 6.2 percent amid a stuttering U.S. economic performance, and due to the increasing use of performance measures to decide on levels of compensation. In the kinds of incentive plans becoming more popular, executives do not receive higher compensation just because a company’s share price rises, but rather must perform well on a series of measures - not just profit, but often including revenue, margins, cash flow, and in some cases even a company’s safety and environment records. “They’re not going to get monster rewards,” said Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York. “The indications are that companies continue to do a better job of matching up pay with performance.” However, the figures are unlikely to assuage concerns that CEOs are reaping bigger increases than those received by many Americans further down the food chain, exacerbating inequality. President Barack Obama has been stressing policies intended to reduce inequality, such as a push for a higher minimum wage. The study looks at what was granted to CEOs for 2013 and does not include all the compensation CEOs actually pocketed in 2013 after stock and option awards granted to them in previous years were exercised or vested. With the S&P; 500 surging 32.4 percent last year, including dividends, and almost tripling from the lows it hit in the financial crisis, some of those awards from 2009-2012 have proven very lucrative. A separate review by executive compensation data firm Equilar of 44 companies in the Fortune 1,000 that filed their statements in January or February shows that the median value executives gained from exercising stock options or stock vesting was $2.1 million in 2013, up 18 percent from 2012. Investor activists and proxy advisers, including ISS, have pressed companies for years to align pay with shareholder interests. In recent weeks, a handful of companies have made radical changes in the way they reward their CEOs, including semiconductor maker Intel Corp and mining group Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. Among the 46 S&P; 500 companies surveyed, the median cash salary rose $27,584, or 2.6 percent, to $1,079,327. But the median stock award rose $337,493, or 9.5 percent, to $3,887,008, and the median cash incentive award rose $63,799, or 3.3 percent, to $1,998,102. Restraining the overall increase, though, were less generous stock options awards. Of the 46 companies, only 32 of them awarded stock options to their CEOs in 2013, down from 35 in 2012. For those 35 companies (including those who did not grant options in 2013), the average award fell by $548,543, or 23 percent, to $1,880,476 in 2013. Some companies said they reduced their option awards as they wanted to reduce the incentive to take certain risks. At financial services company Comerica Inc, total compensation for CEO Ralph Babb fell 10 percent to $6.46 million, as the value of his option awards fell to $314,729 from $1,047,682 in 2012. Comerica said in a filing it cut the weighting of stock option awards during the year to “discourage inappropriate risk taking and better align with regulatory expectations.” At paint maker Sherwin-Williams, total compensation for CEO Christopher Connor fell 1.5 percent to $10.8 million, as the value of stock option awards fell to $3 million from $3.3 million in 2012. The company said in a filing that it has de-emphasized stock options in favor of stock awards related to performance to provide more focus on operating performance. “Most CEOs get it, an increase in stock price is going to be their greatest opportunity for compensation,” said David Dorman, an investor and board member at a series of companies, including  network technology company Motorola Solutions Inc, pharmacy group CVS Caremark Corp and KFC and Pizza Hut owner Yum! Brands Inc. He said that generally compensation for executives in corporate America “will be in a pretty tight range.” A few caveats apply to the ISS figures. They do not include set-asides for executive pensions and other deferred obligations, which are often established by formula. At some companies these set-asides fell in 2013 as interest rates rose. John Roe, ISS’s executive director of corporate services, said companies have embraced new forms of pay. “For the companies in this sample, it was a year of compensation adjustments rather than increases,” he said. The ISS review focused mainly on median figures as a way to exclude results from companies at the top and bottom of the pay scale that could distort the conclusions. On an average basis, CEOs among the early S&P; 500 filers received $9.34 million in compensation in 2013 - an increase of 2 percent from the average in 2012. Since 2011, most U.S. companies have submitted their pay plans for non-binding shareholder votes amid concerns about excessive executive compensation. While investors have largely supported management, the contests have given some leverage to reformers, particularly as activist investors press companies to make pay depend on relative measures like share price versus peers. The pressure has made a difference at some companies. For example, Freeport got only 29 percent support from shareholders for its executive compensation plan last year. Citing shareholder views, the company on March 3 filed a plan that would cut in half the salaries of its three top executives to $1.25 million from $2.5 million. The company also said it gave them an annual compensation goal of $7.5 million, with the final figures to be based on the company’s operating cash flow, copper and oil production volumes, and performance on safety and environmental scores. Executives could still earn more than that if the company outperforms peers. All of the elements, except for the base salary, are “at risk” and could be worth nothing in a bad year, Freeport spokesman Eric Kinneberg said via email.  There is “real potential downside if performance is not good.” Other companies that reworked pay after facing vigorous opposition to its executive compensation policies from some shareholders include Intel, which won 68 percent support last year, and Walt Disney Co with 58 percent. (Intel and Disney were not among the 46 companies in the study as Intel has yet to file its proxy statement and Disney has a fiscal year ending in September) Disney said in a filing that it reduced the bonus paid to Chief Executive Robert Iger by almost $3 million to $13.6 million for fiscal 2013 after the company’s results did not beat certain goals. Intel last month outlined changes for its new CEO Brian Krzanich such as allowing equity awards to fall in value if returns for shareholders don’t meet targets. Although Krzanich was promoted to the CEO job last May his compensation was less in 2013, $9.1 million, than the $15.7 million he got in 2012 when he was chief operating officer. It is also less than half the $18.3 million his predecessor as CEO - Paul Otellini - got in 2012. Brit Wittman, Intel’s director of executive compensation, said the changes were made because shareholders wanted pay to be more closely tied to performance, especially after the financial crisis soured many on pay models that once were widely used. “Pay for failure really seems to alienate investors,” he said.",3172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/compensation-ceos-2013/rpt-insight-growth-in-compensation-for-u-s-ceos-may-have-slowed-idUSL2N0ME02O20140317

644,DIS,Last-minute Disney policy change averts proxy access vote,"PORTLAND, Oregon (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co amended guidelines on Tuesday for the selection of its chairman, persuading investors to withdraw a proposal to grant large shareholders more say in electing directors just hours before it was to have gone to a vote. The last-minute change states that the chairman should be an independent director unless justified in writing. It averted a potential contest, and investors re-elected Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger and nine other directors to the media company’s board at its annual shareholder meeting. Disney shareholders had been scheduled to vote on a “proxy access” resolution that asked the company to allow large shareholders to nominate board members. The change scrapped that vote, after the resolution’s proponents agreed to withdraw their proposal, according to a regulatory filing from Disney. Iger’s dual appointment as chairman and chief executive, in effect since 2012, has drawn criticism from some investors and driven support for the proposal. A similar resolution won the support of 40 percent of voters a year ago. The latest amendment to the guidelines allows for exceptions to the rule, provided the company justifies in writing annually why that would be in the best interests of shareholders. In such cases, Disney said it will also designate one independent director its lead director. “The chairman of the board shall in the normal course be an independent director unless the board concludes that, in the light of the circumstances then present when any such decision is made, the best interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served,” Disney said in its early morning filing. A Disney spokesman said on Tuesday that the amendment clarified a standard that the company’s board had previously committed to. At the shareholder meeting, all current board members were re-elected with at least 92 percent of the vote. They include Twitter Inc Co-Founder Jack Dorsey, who joined the board in December, and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Iger won the support of 99 percent of ballots cast. The results are preliminary based on votes cast ahead of the meeting. Shareholders approved the compensation packages for Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote, with support coming from 80 percent of ballots cast. Disney’s shares have surged 42 percent in the past year to $81.99 after strong results from cable TV sports juggernaut ESPN, theme parks and the company’s movie studio, which is riding a $1 billion hit with Oscar-winning animated film “Frozen.” Iger told shareholders that “Frozen” is now poised to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time, surpassing “Toy Story 3” from Disney’s Pixar unit. He also revealed that the new “Star Wars” movie set for release in December 2015 will be set 30 years after 1983 film “Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.” In addition, Disney’s movie studio is planning sequels to Pixar’s “Cars” and “The Incredibles” movies, Iger said.

646,DIS,New 'Star Wars' film to be set 30 years after 'Return of the Jedi',"PORTLAND, Oregon (Reuters) - The highly anticipated next installment of the “Star Wars” franchise will be set 30 years after “Episode VI: Return of the Jedi,” Walt Disney Co.’s chief executive officer Bob Iger said on Tuesday at the company’s annual shareholders meeting. Disney purchased “Star Wars” production company LucasFilm for $4.05 billion in 2012 and announced it would release three new films in the popular sci-fi series. Fans have been avidly awaiting details of the next film, “Star Wars: Episode VII.” “Return of the Jedi” was the third film in the first trilogy of “Star Wars” released between 1977 and 1983. The series is set in a galaxy far, far away, in the past. Iger did not reveal any casting news, other than to confirm the return of the robot character R2D2. The official Star Wars website posted on Monday the new films would feature “a trio of new young leads along with some very familiar faces,” and that filming would begin in May at London’s famed Pinewood studios.

647,DIS,New 'Star Wars' film to be set 30 years after 'Return of the Jedi',"PORTLAND, Oregon, March 18 (Reuters) - The highly anticipated next installment of the “Star Wars” franchise will be set 30 years after “Episode VI: Return of the Jedi,” Walt Disney Co.’s chief executive officer Bob Iger said on Tuesday at the company’s annual shareholders meeting. Disney purchased “Star Wars” production company LucasFilm for $4.05 billion in 2012 and announced it would release three new films in the popular sci-fi series. Fans have been avidly awaiting details of the next film, “Star Wars: Episode VII.” “Return of the Jedi” was the third film in the first trilogy of “Star Wars” released between 1977 and 1983. The series is set in a galaxy far, far away, in the past. Iger did not reveal any casting news, other than to confirm the return of the robot character R2D2. The official Star Wars website posted on Monday the new films would feature “a trio of new young leads along with some very familiar faces,” and that filming would begin in May at London’s famed Pinewood studios. Rumors have swirled for over a year on whether some of the franchise’s stars, including Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, would return.

650,DIS,Disney averts tricky vote with last-minute board policy change,"PORTLAND, Oregon, March 18 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co  amended guidelines on Tuesday for the selection of its chairman, persuading investors to withdraw a proposal to grant large shareholders more say in electing directors just hours before it was to have gone to a vote. The last-minute change stipulates that the chairman should be an independent director unless justified in writing. It averted a potential contest later on Tuesday, as investors prepared to re-elect Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger as chairman of the board and elect other directors. Disney shareholders had been scheduled to vote on a resolution that asked the company to allow large shareholders to nominate board members. The last-minute change scraps that vote, after the resolution’s proponents agreed to withdraw their proposal. Iger’s dual appointment as chairman and chief executive, in effect since 2012, has drawn criticism from some investors and driven support for the proposal. The latest amendment to the guidelines allows for exceptions to the rule, provided the company justifies in writing annually why that would be in the best interests of shareholders. In such cases, Disney said it will also designate one independent director its lead director. “The chairman of the board shall in the normal course be an independent director unless the board concludes that, in the light of the circumstances then present when any such decision is made, the best interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served,” Disney said in its early morning filing. A Disney spokesman said on Tuesday that the amendment clarified a standard that the company’s board had previously committed to.

655,DIS,Last-minute Disney policy change averts proxy access vote,"PORTLAND, Oregon (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co appeased large shareholders who demanded more say in the naming of directors and splitting of the chairman and chief executive officer jobs in the future, persuading them to withdraw a proposal hours before it was to have gone to a vote on Tuesday. A last-minute change in board guidelines specified that the chairman should be an independent director unless the company justifies it in writing. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has also served as chairman since 2012. The shareholder deal averted a contest, and investors re-elected Iger and nine other directors at Disney’s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. Disney shareholders had originally been scheduled to vote on a “proxy access” resolution that asked the company to allow large shareholders to nominate board members. The resolution’s proponents agreed to withdraw their proposal, according to a regulatory filing from Disney. Iger’s dual appointment as chairman and chief executive has drawn criticism from some investors and driven support for the proposal. A similar resolution won the support of 40 percent of votes a year ago. The latest amendment to the guidelines allows for exceptions to the rule, provided the company justifies in writing annually why that would be in the best interests of shareholders. In such cases, Disney said it will also designate one independent director its lead director. “The chairman of the board shall in the normal course be an independent director unless the board concludes that, in the light of the circumstances then present when any such decision is made, the best interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served,” Disney said in its early morning filing. A Disney spokesman said on Tuesday that the amendment clarified a standard that the company’s board had previously committed to. At the shareholder meeting, all current board members were re-elected with at least 92 percent of the vote. They include Twitter Inc Co-Founder Jack Dorsey, who joined the board in December, and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Iger won the support of 99 percent of ballots cast. The results are preliminary based on votes cast ahead of the meeting. Large shareholders said on Tuesday they would continue to talk to Disney about board transparency and compensation. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, known as CalSTRS, withdrew support for proxy access proposal after Disney amended guidelines. CalSTRS spokesman Ricardo Duran said this showed the company was working to address many of the concerns that prompted that resolution in the first place. But CalSTRS “continues to have issues with the magnitude and structure of the current pay program for the CEO, despite the outstanding performance achieved during Mr. Iger’s tenure,” he added. Those issues included an “emphasis on short-term performance with large cash payments.” Another investor, the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, said it reserved the right to re-file the proposal “if the engagement between the co-filers and Disney does not continue to demonstrate transparency on board leadership issues.” Still, shareholders on Tuesday approved the compensation packages for Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote, with support coming from 80 percent of ballots cast. CalSTRS voted against that resolution, Duran said. Disney previously slashed Iger’s compensation for fiscal 2013 for the year that ended in October by some 15 percent. His bonus was reduced by $3 million because Disney did not outperform his targets by the same “extraordinary amount” as in the previous year, the company said at the time. Disney’s shares surged 42 percent in the past year to $81.99 after strong results from cable TV sports juggernaut ESPN, theme parks and the company’s movie studio, which is riding a $1 billion hit with Oscar-winning animated film “Frozen.” Iger told shareholders that “Frozen” is now poised to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time, surpassing “Toy Story 3” from Disney’s Pixar unit. He also revealed that the new “Star Wars” movie set for release in December 2015 will be set 30 years after 1983 film “Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.” In addition, Disney’s movie studio is planning sequels to Pixar’s “Cars” and “The Incredibles” movies, Iger said.

657,DIS,Disney's 'Aladdin' unleashes a genie on Broadway,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - It has a flying carpet, a cave full of treasures and show-stopping songs, but critics said on Friday the Broadway debut of Disney’s “Aladdin” lacks the magic of the original Oscar-winning animated film. The tale of the street urchin Aladdin, who wins the heart of Princess Jasmine, unleashes the Genie from the lamp and battles the evil Jafar, was the top-grossing film of 1992, and picked up Academy Awards for best original score and song for “A Whole New World.” The musical that opened on Thursday night is the latest Disney film to be adapted for the stage, following the long-running and hugely successful “Lion King,” “Beauty and the Beast,” “The Little Mermaid” and others. Although “Aladdin” includes new songs, elaborate costumes and sets, dance numbers and a magical carpet that mysteriously floats, it left some critics wishing for more. “This super-costly extravaganza doesn’t do justice to the movie, or to the spirit of the late Howard Ashman,” trade magazine Variety said, referring to the lyricist who had the original inspiration for the film. The Hollywood Reporter described the show as “sweet, silly fun,” while the New York Daily News found the extravagant production lacking compared to the film. “Most moving thing in ‘Aladdin’ is the flying carpet,” it said in a headline, adding that the musical was “entertaining but an emotionally sparse adaptation” of the film. “While burning through wishes, you should ask for a musical with a lot more heart,” it said. But the New York Times’ Charles Isherwood, who admitted he was not enthusiastic about the prospect of yet another Disney show on Broadway, said the show defied his dour expectations. “Aladdin’ has an infectious and only mildly syrupy spirit,” he wrote. “Not to mention enough baubles, bangles and beading to keep a whole season of ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ contestants in gear.” Adam Jacobs (“The Lion King”) plays Aladdin in the show directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw (“Elf”). Courtney Reed (“Mama Mia”) is the rebellious Princess Jasmine and James Monroe Iglehart (“Memphis”) takes on the role of the Genie that was voiced by comic Robin Williams in the film version. Although less enthusiastic about the musical, the New York Post had high praise for Iglehart’s rousing performance. “Disney’s new ‘Aladdin’ doesn’t quite catch lightening in a bottle - but it lets a pretty nifty genie out of a lamp,” the newspaper said. “That would be James Monroe Iglehart.” USA Today went a step further, saying Iglehart’s rendition of the song “Friend Like Me” topped the version sung by Williams. “By the end of the number, which includes a game-show segment, a medley of tunes from other Disney musicals, Iglehart’s Genie is deliriously huffing and puffing: the audience, which received it at a recent preview with a standing ovation, is just as giddy,” the newspaper said. The Hollywood Reporter found the musical perhaps the most old-school of Disney’s screen-to-stage adaptations since “Beauty and the Beast” but added it could still become a family-friendly hit. “It’s not the most sophisticated entertainment, but the target demographic won’t mind at all,” it said. Another Disney movie bound for Broadway is “Frozen,” this year’s Oscar-winning best animated film which has generated $1 billion at the global box office since November.

659,DIS,UPDATE 1-'Divergent' teen warriors defeat 'Muppets' at box office,"(Adds details, background, quotes) By Lisa Richwine and Chris Michaud LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Dystopian thriller “Divergent,” the story of a society that divides people based on personality traits, dominated weekend movie charts with $56 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales, kicking off a new franchise for “Hunger Games” producer Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Walt Disney Co family comedy “Muppets Most Wanted” finished in second place, nabbing $16.5 million from Friday through Sunday, according to estimates provided by Rentrak. Animated “Mr. Peabody & Sherman,” produced by Dreamworks Animation Inc, took the No. 3 slot with $11.7 million. “Divergent” is adapted from a popular series of young adult novels by newcomer author Veronica Roth. Ahead of the weekend, forecasters had predicted the film would debut with between $50 million and $68 million in North American (U.S. and Canadian) ticket sales. Shailene Woodley stars in “Divergent” as Tris Prior, a teenager who doesn’t fit in to a faction because she has multiple dominant personality traits, making her a threat to the government. She chooses to join the Dauntless faction of warriors who defend the society’s inhabitants. British actor Theo James plays Four, Tris’ mentor and love interest. The debut of “Divergent” fell short of the box office heights of two other young adult franchises. “Hunger Games” started with a massive $152.5 million in March 2012 while  “Twilight” opened with $69.6 million in November 2008. Lions Gate said Friday it was confident “Divergent” would become an important franchise for the company and it was moving ahead with the second film in the series, called “Insurgent,” which will reach theaters in March 2015. Noting that the “Divergent” opening was shy of blockbusters “Hunger Games” and “Twilight,” Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co., said “$56 million is a great opening for any film,  and virtually locked down the proposed trilogy.” “This is something to build on for the series, and with the cast expected to be in high demand, the ‘Divergent’ legacy will continue to grow,” Bock added. Richie Fay, the studio’s president of domestic distribution, said, “We’re very pleased with the outcome for the franchise launch.” The movie’s A+ CinemaScore grade from the under-18 audience bodes well for the coming weeks as spring break and Easter school holidays approach, Fay said, noting, “The young adult audience has been underserved in the last couple of weeks.” The company spent $85 million to produce “Divergent,” plus $40 million to $45 million on marketing, according to a person with knowledge of the film’s budget. The studio has recouped about $70 million of the cost through international licensing deals, the person said. “Muppets Most Wanted,” a sequel to a 2011 “Muppets” movie, stars Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey and Ty Burrell alongside Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog and other classic Muppet characters. In the new film, Kermit is imprisoned in a Russian gulag in a case of mistaken identity, while an evil impostor travels with his muppet friends on a European tour. “Mr. Peabody and Sherman” brought its global sales through three weekends to $172 million. The movie was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Rounding out the domestic charts, Greek warrior sequel “300: Rise of an Empire” landed in fourth place with $8.7 million, while the independent faith-based new release “God’s Not Dead” pulled in $8.6 million to claim the No. 5 spot. Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner, released “300: Rise of an Empire.”    (Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles and Chris Michaud in New York; Editing by Sophie Hares and Jan Paschal)",3232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/boxoffice/update-1-divergent-teen-warriors-defeat-muppets-at-box-office-idUSL1N0MK05H20140323
660,DIS,Disney to buy YouTube network Maker Studios for $500 million,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co has agreed to buy Maker Studios, one of YouTube’s largest networks, for $500 million, a deal that makes Disney a major online video distributor and should help draw more teens into the Disney entertainment empire. The price tag could rise to $950 million if Maker hits certain performance milestones, Disney said, confirming what a source told Reuters earlier on Monday. Maker, founded in 2009, is one of the largest video production networks on Google Inc’s YouTube. Its producers target the younger millennial generation, known for its high appetite for online video. “This gives a presence online to reach the millennial group that is increasingly getting its video online,” said Kevin Mayer, Disney executive vice president for corporate strategy. “And it gives us a lot of data to help promote our other businesses to them.” The deal will be “mildly dilutive” to earnings per share through fiscal 2017, Mayer said. Disney’s fiscal year closes at the end of September. Maker helps produce and distribute videos to more than 380 million subscribers worldwide across more than 55,000 channels. Its videos now collectively garner some 5.5 billion views every month, according to the source. The company, whose backers include Time Warner Investments, Upfront Ventures and Greycroft Partners, is partners with PewDiePie, the online persona of 24 year-old video gamer Felix Kjellberg.

661,DIS,UPDATE 2-Disney to buy YouTube network Maker Studios for $500 mln,"(Adds comment from Disney executive, forecast for impact on earnings, paragraphs 4-6) By Ronald Grover LOS ANGELES, March 24 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co  has agreed to buy Maker Studios, one of YouTube’s largest networks, for $500 million, a deal that makes Disney a major online video distributor and should help draw more teens into the Disney entertainment empire. The price tag could rise to $950 million if Maker hits certain performance milestones, Disney said, confirming what a source told Reuters earlier on Monday. Maker, founded in 2009, is one of the largest video production networks on Google Inc’s YouTube. Its producers target the younger millennial generation, known for its high appetite for online video. “This gives a presence online to reach the millennial group that is increasingly getting its video online,” said Kevin Mayer, Disney executive vice president for corporate strategy. “And it gives us a lot of data to help promote our other businesses to them.” The deal will be “mildly dilutive” to earnings per share through fiscal 2017, Mayer said. Disney’s fiscal year closes at the end of September. Maker helps produce and distribute videos to more than 380 million subscribers worldwide across more than 55,000 channels. Its videos now collectively garner some 5.5 billion views every month, according to the source. The company, whose backers include Time Warner Investments, Upfront Ventures and Greycroft Partners, is partners with PewDiePie, the online persona of 24 year-old video gamer Felix Kjellberg. Kjellberg has more than 25 million subscribers and is YouTube’s single most-subscribed star. “Short-form online video is growing at an astonishing pace and with Maker Studios, Disney will now be at the center of this dynamic industry,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a statement.

Since Disney bought Marvel for $4 billion in 2009, Marvel characters have starred in some of Hollywood’s biggest hits. “Iron Man 3” was last year’s second-highest grossing film with domestic ticket sales of $409 million, according to the site Box Office Mojo. In 2012, “Marvel’s The Avengers” was the third-biggest film in Hollywood history, with $623.4 million in domestic sales and $1.5 billion worldwide. “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” is “a safe bet” to pass $250 million, said Box Office Mojo. Disney takes advantage of each hit by spinning it through its sprawling network of theme parks, TV studio and consumer products units. The movies sell well on DVD, and Disney will generate hefty revenue from sales of “Captain America” t-shirts, lunch boxes and action figures. The company is also making four original live-action TV series for Netflix that will begin streaming next year. “When you put the name Marvel on a movie, we think that it gives us essentially a head start with the audience,” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts during a conference call in February. “Noah,” starring Russell Crowe as the biblical figure, was second with $17 million in ticket sales from Friday to Sunday. The dystopian action film “Divergent” was third with $13 million, for a total of $114 million since its March 21 release in U.S. and Canadian theaters. “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” also scored the biggest opening weekend of 2014, and took in another $9.6 million at IMAX screenings, for which moviegoers a premium. That also set a new April record. “I would certainly expect we can broaden out” beyond the usual Marvel film buyers, said Dave Hollis, Walt Disney Studios’ executive vice president of film distribution. Hollis noted that some 90 percent of critics gave positive notices as collated by the Rotten Tomatoes website and audiences rated the film an A. Fourth for the weekend, with sales of $7.7 million, was the independently released Christian drama “God’s Not Dead,” which continued its impressive run despite being panned by critics. “The Grand Budapest Hotel” rounded out the top five, taking in $6.3 million. Starring Ralph Fiennes as a scheming concierge and directed by Wes Anderson, the film started slowly, playing in only four theaters on March 7 and has grown steadily. It is currently playing in 1,263 theaters. Disney distributed “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.” “Noah” was released by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom.

The company is also making four original live-action TV series for Netflix that will begin streaming next year. “When you put the name Marvel on a movie, we think that it gives us essentially a head start with the audience,” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts during a conference call in February. “Noah,” starring Russell Crowe as the biblical figure, was second with $17 million in ticket sales from Friday to Sunday. The dystopian action film “Divergent” was third with $13 million, for a total of $114 million since its March 21 release in U.S. and Canadian theaters. “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” also scored the biggest opening weekend of 2014, and took in another $9.6 million at IMAX screenings, for which moviegoers a premium. That also set a new April record. “I would certainly expect we can broaden out” beyond the usual Marvel film buyers, said Dave Hollis, Walt Disney Studios’ executive vice president of film distribution. Hollis noted that some 90 percent of critics gave positive notices as collated by the Rotten Tomatoes website and audiences rated the film an A. Fourth for the weekend, with sales of $7.7 million, was the independently released Christian drama “God’s Not Dead,” which continued its impressive run despite being panned by critics. “The Grand Budapest Hotel” rounded out the top five, taking in $6.3 million. Starring Ralph Fiennes as a scheming concierge and directed by Wes Anderson, the film started slowly, playing in only four theaters on March 7 and has grown steadily. It is currently playing in 1,263 theaters. Disney distributed “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.” “Noah” was released by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom. Lionsgate distributed “Divergent.” “The Grand Budapest Hotel” was released by Fox Searchlight, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox. “God’s Not Dead” was distributed by Freestyle Releasing.

678,DIS,Families of autistic kids sue Disney parks over policy on lines,"(Reuters) - Families with autistic children have sued Walt Disney Co, alleging the company does not provide adequate access to theme park visitors with autism who have difficulty waiting in long lines for rides. In October 2013, Disney parks stopped offering autistic visitors a “guest assistance card” that let them and their families bypass lines, according to a lawsuit filed April 3 in federal court in California. Instead, the company offered a “disability access service” card to allow them to obtain scheduled return times for park attractions. Disney changed the policy after media reports of abuse of guest assistance cards, such as visitors hiring disabled people to help them skip lines. The 16 plaintiffs who are suing Disney said the company is violating requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They said offering a return time is equivalent to a wait, and there is no guarantee of immediate access to attractions at the return time. In a statement on Tuesday, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts said it had “an unwavering commitment to providing an inclusive and accessible environment for all our guests.” “We fully comply with all ADA requirements and believe that the legal claims are without merit,” the company added. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and asks the court to order Disney to change its current policy.

Disney’s cable operations reported $6 billion in operating income, a 6 percent increase, for the 2013 fiscal year ended Sept. 28. The unit includes sports channel ESPN, the Disney Channel, ABC Family and others. The company may make more deals that allow pay-TV providers to offer Disney-owned networks over the Internet and outside of a traditional TV subscription, Rasulo said. Dish Network Corp  reached an agreement with Disney in March to offer that type of “over-the-top” package. The Dish deal “is very unlikely to be the last,” Rasulo said. Disney recently renewed distribution deals with eight of the top 10 U.S. pay-TV operators, he said. It expects to reach agreements by year end with the other two — satellite TV provider DirecTV and the National Cable Television Cooperative, which negotiates programming deals on behalf of more than 950 small U.S. cable operators.

695,DIS,"AOL, Microsoft lure advertisers with TV-style shows","NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, April 23 (Reuters) - Technology powerhouses like Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc are flexing their muscles as storytellers, parading TV network-style shows before advertisers at an annual digital content showcase in New York next week. With an eye on the big bucks such shows can command, Microsoft will trot out a soccer reality show called “Every Street United.” Sony Corp’s digital network Crackle will serve up Jerry Seinfeld’s “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New Yorkers called “Connected.” This is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long “NewFronts” event - modeled after the annual “upfronts” where broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison Avenue. Yahoo Inc is also looking for longer original programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the deals have yet to be finalized. Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo’s earnings call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more focused investments in original content. “We are going to see more original content overall and no doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV because they have their eyes on TV dollars,” said Kris Magel, chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying division of Interpublic Group of Cos. But TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online video commercials that usually run before and during a program, advertisers and analysts said. “Online video just doesn’t offer nearly the reach that broadcast does,” said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. AOL has spent about half a billion dollars over the last three years on shorter content. On Wednesday, it also inked a deal with Miramax to stream the independent studio’s films on the AOL network for free, but with ads. “Internet companies are bucketed into the snackable short form space,” Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video, said. “But we are seeing the growth in the consumption of content on big screens.” At the NewFronts, which starts on April 28, Microsoft will show longer original shows produced by the company’s Xbox Entertainment Studios that exploit the Internet’s strengths. “The challenge TV has is it’s not very effective in being able to reach a very discrete target audience and measure it and have more interactive components,” said Scott Ferris, general manager of TV and video advertising for Microsoft. “We have very engaged, high-quality audiences.” Online series can get messages in front of people who watch little TV, said Peter Naylor, senior vice president of sales for Hulu.com. The website, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and 21st Century Fox, will also pitch shows to advertisers next week. “There is a segment of the video universe that is very, very hard to reach through traditional television,” Naylor said. “Online video is a way to reach those light TV viewers.” But because online viewers have to search for content, advertisers may end up paying more to reach them than on TV. The cost per thousand (CPM) for a commercial on a cable network, for example, might be between $10 to $30, depending on the show and the demographic, estimates Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. For online video, a CPM for a comparable demographic could be in the range of $20 to $40. “There is a lot of aspiration in the NewFronts initiatives,” said Wieser. “The reality is traditional TV budgets are intended for content vehicles that are TV-like. (Content) with short term, low budgets with unknown or even known talent is unlikely to capture anything resembling a meaningful TV budget.” Another hurdle is that the money that presenters make from the NewFronts is not tracked by the Internet Advertising Bureau which hosts the event. Ari Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry’s annual showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue online. However, it may take some time before online shows become mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars. Until then, the NewFronts “is more of a showcase for what’s new and exciting,” Bluman said.

With an eye on the big bucks such shows can command, Microsoft will trot out a soccer reality show called “Every Street United.” Sony Corp’s digital network Crackle will serve up Jerry Seinfeld’s “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New Yorkers called “Connected.” This is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long “NewFronts” event - modeled after the annual “upfronts” where broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison Avenue. Yahoo Inc is also looking for longer original programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the deals have yet to be finalized. Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo’s earnings call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more focused investments in original content. “We are going to see more original content overall and no doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV because they have their eyes on TV dollars,” said Kris Magel, chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying division of Interpublic Group of Cos. But TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online video commercials that usually run before and during a program, advertisers and analysts said. “Online video just doesn’t offer nearly the reach that broadcast does,” said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. AOL has spent about half a billion dollars over the last three years on shorter content. On Wednesday, it also inked a deal with Miramax to stream the independent studio’s films on the AOL network for free, but with ads. “Internet companies are bucketed into the snackable short form space,” Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video, said. “But we are seeing the growth in the consumption of content on big screens.” At the NewFronts, which starts on April 28, Microsoft will show longer original shows produced by the company’s Xbox Entertainment Studios that exploit the Internet’s strengths. “The challenge TV has is it’s not very effective in being able to reach a very discrete target audience and measure it and have more interactive components,” said Scott Ferris, general manager of TV and video advertising for Microsoft. “We have very engaged, high-quality audiences.” Online series can get messages in front of people who watch little TV, said Peter Naylor, senior vice president of sales for Hulu.com. The website, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and 21st Century Fox, will also pitch shows to advertisers next week. “There is a segment of the video universe that is very, very hard to reach through traditional television,” Naylor said. “Online video is a way to reach those light TV viewers.” But because online viewers have to search for content, advertisers may end up paying more to reach them than on TV. The cost per thousand (CPM) for a commercial on a cable network, for example, might be between $10 to $30, depending on the show and the demographic, estimates Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. For online video, a CPM for a comparable demographic could be in the range of $20 to $40. “There is a lot of aspiration in the NewFronts initiatives,” said Wieser. “The reality is traditional TV budgets are intended for content vehicles that are TV-like. (Content) with short term, low budgets with unknown or even known talent is unlikely to capture anything resembling a meaningful TV budget.” Another hurdle is that the money that presenters make from the NewFronts is not tracked by the Interactive Advertising Bureau which hosts the event. Ari Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry’s annual showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue online. However, it may take some time before online shows become mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars. Until then, the NewFronts “is more of a showcase for what’s new and exciting,” Bluman said.

701,DIS,Disney to increase investment in Chinese theme park and resort,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney (DIS.N) said on Monday it has struck a deal with its Chinese joint venture partner to increase investment in its upcoming resort and theme park, Shanghai Disney, by an additional $800 million. The expansion comes with an eye on China’s fast-growing entertainment and media market, which is expected to grow to $148 billion by 2015 from around $120 billion in 2013, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ outlook for the global entertainment and media business 2011-2015. The increased investment will be used primarily to fund additional attractions to increase capacity at the park, with most targeted to be completed for opening day, Disney said in a statement. The owner of parks and resorts worldwide, including in cities like Tokyo and Paris, on its website says the Shanghai theme park and resort is slated for opening in late 2015. The joint venture’s total investment in the theme park, touted as China’s answer to Orlando, will now total $5.5 billion after the increased investment, a Disney spokesman confirmed. State-owned Shanghai Shendi will continue to hold 57 percent of the shares of the owner companies, while Disney said it will hold the remaining 43 percent. Disney, which also operates a theme park in Hong Kong, signed an agreement in 2010 for its first theme park in mainland China. (r.reuters.com/vej88v) Financing of the additional investment will be proportionate to ownership and third-party debt is not expected to pay for the expansion, Disney said. Disney in February reported higher profit for the quarter that ended in December, beating Wall Street expectations due to growth at its sports network and the blockbuster animated hit film “Frozen. Higher guest spending in the United States also helped push up profit at Disney’s theme parks unit.

707,DIS,Disney beats forecasts as 'Frozen' fuels earnings,"(Reuters) - Media company Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Tuesday reported higher profit that beat Wall Street expectations for the quarter ended in March, boosted by the continued strength of its blockbuster animated film “Frozen.” The company said it posted adjusted earnings of $1.11 a share, beating the 96 cent average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A year ago, Disney reported adjusted earnings of 79 cents a share. Disney shares rose 1.3 percent in after-hours trading, to $82.05 a share. Net income for the quarter increased to $1.9 billion from $1.5 billion a year earlier, lifted by growth at its movie studio. The animated blockbuster “Frozen,” about two royal sisters in an icy kingdom, continued to propel the studio, which saw its operating income quadruple to $475 million from $118 million a year earlier, partially on the strength of “Frozen” sales on home video. To further cash in on the film’s popularity, Disney will increase the presence of “Frozen” characters at theme parks and could to use them in its publishing and interactive gaming businesses, Chief Executive Bob Iger said on a conference call. “The passion for this film and these characters is so extraordinary, so well beyond what we’ve ever imagined, that it would be hard to believe that it wouldn’t sustain itself over a fairly long period of time,” Iger said. The film had worldwide ticket sales of $1.2 billion, including $400.3 million during its five-month run in U.S. and Canadian theaters. “The real surprise was the studio,” Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said. He said he had expected expecting operating income of around $300 million for the unit. “They have importantly managed to revitalize Disney Animation as a full peer to Pixar.” All of Disney’s other units reported higher profit. Operating earnings at its TV operations, its largest unit, increased by 15 percent despite lower ratings at its ABC broadcast network. The company’s sports behemoth ESPN helped boost cable operating income by 15 percent, largely through higher affiliate fees from pay TV providers. Higher average ticket prices helped lift operating income at Disney’s theme park operations, which increased by 19 percent to $457 million on higher attendance at Disneyland and increased guest spending at Walt Disney World. Disney last week announced the company and its Chinese partners would increase their investment in a theme park under construction in Shanghai by $800 million. Iger on Tuesday said it may invest more in the park, which is slated to open in 2015. “It’s a pretty compelling circumstance or opportunity for us and our partners and probably will deserve an infusion of more capital investment,” he said.

Rhimes’s new show “How to Get Away with Murder,” a legal drama starring Oscar-nominated actress Viola Davis, will air on Thursday nights with the producer’s other two shows, setting up an all-Rhimes night. The network, owned by the Walt Disney Co, will add another show from Disney’s Marvel action hero-generating unit, with the mid-season show “Marvel’s Agent Carter” based on its blockbuster “Captain America” movies. “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” returns for a second season.

712,DIS,Disney throws another feel-good pitch with 'Million Dollar Arm',"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - In the new Disney film “Million Dollar Arm,” Jon Hamm is soaked in perspiration, not the alcohol-induced sweat of his “Mad Men” character Don Draper, but the kind that comes from filming a modest production in India in the hottest part of the year.  Despite working in conditions he calls “remarkably warm and challenging,” the baseball tale with a global twist gave Hamm not only his first lead role in film but one that was decidedly more upbeat than the ad man that made him famous on television. “I love the fact that it has a family component to it and it has redemption,” said Hamm. “You leave the movie theater with a smile on your face. It’s a nice alternative to my other on-screen persona, who is a little bit darker.” Hamm plays sports agent J.B. Bernstein who, in a desperate bid to drum up clients, goes to India to find baseball pitchers among the country’s cricket-loving sportsmen. It’s a real-life story that warmed hearts over at the Walt Disney Co. By the standards of the studio known for big-budget blockbusters, “Million Dollar Arm” is a small film, with a budget of $25 million, a fraction of the $200 million it cost to make the soon-to-be-released “Maleficent” with Angelina Jolie.  But it is in a league of Disney movies - along with last year’s Disney history piece “Saving Mr. Banks” and the upcoming sports drama “McFarland” - that enhance the Disney brand with an uplifting, against-all-odds story.  “We believe in great stories, both big and small, that depict values such as courage, ambition, hard work and family,” said Dave Hollis, Walt Disney Studios’ executive vice president of film distribution. “‘Million Dollar Arm’ is a great story that has those unique human themes throughout.”   With its nationwide release on Friday, “Million Dollar Arm” is expected to generate $15 million in ticket sales during its first weekend in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Boxoffice.com. It’s an alternative to the other film opening this weekend, the “Godzilla” remake distributed by Warner Bros. that should bring in $78 million. The first part of “Million Dollar Arm” plays out in a hot and chaotic Mumbai where J.B. struggles to get his improbable venture off the ground with a reality show. After frustrating rounds of tryouts, the American agent finds two strong arms in Rinku and Dinesh in rural India and brings them to Southern California, where they undergo training before being shown to Major League Baseball scouts.  The young men find themselves struggling with the culture, the lifestyle and, most importantly, the business expectations that J.B. has for them. His neighbor Brenda, a doctor played by Lake Bell, works to suture the fraying relationship in time to save their chances of making it in American baseball. For the roles of the Indian pitchers, Disney chose Suraj Sharma, the actor stranded on a raft with the tiger in Ang Lee’s “Life of Pi,” and Madhur Mittal, best known as Salim in the best picture Oscar winner “Slumdog Millionaire” - casting that might help widen the film’s global appeal. Bell and Hamm, who are friends in real life, both highlighted one of the great advantages of working on a Disney film: for a change, they can send anyone in their families to see it and not have to worry about uncomfortable scenes. “It is nice to be part of a project that my sister can take her kids to,” said Hamm.  Prior to “Million Dollar Arm,” Hamm played an FBI agent in  Ben Affleck’s 2010 crime caper “The Town”  and a bit part as  the loathsome lothario in the 2011 women-driven comedy “Bridesmaids.”  “I think you can make an argument that I was actually the star of ‘Bridesmaids,’” he joked. As he films the final episodes of “Mad Men” to air next year on the AMC cable network, Hamm said he has no road map for his career post-Don Draper, although “Million Dollar Arm” fit perfectly into his loose plan.    “I just want to work on things I find interesting in some way and this is a perfect example of something I find interesting,” said Hamm, who happens to be a big baseball fan.

716,DIS,A Minute With: Actress Lake Bell on going from indie to Disney,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Lake Bell, one of the few actresses in Hollywood who can also add the titles of writer and director to her name, swapped the world of quirky independent film for an international Disney movie in her latest on-screen role.  The 35-year-old Bell wrote, directed and starred in her own independent movie “In a World...” in 2013, winning critical praise for her comic look into the rarefied world of voice over artists. “It changed my life,” she says of the experience. Now Bell stars opposite “Mad Men” star Jon Hamm in the Walt Disney Co feel-good sports drama “Million Dollar Arm” opening in U.S. theaters on Friday. She plays Brenda the neighbor and doctor who helps sports agent J.B. Bernstein in his improbable quest to train two baseball pitchers from India. Much to her disappointment, Bell didn’t get to go to India to film. But she did get to talk to Reuters about what it’s like to work in her first Disney film, how it is thankfully lacking in a “weird boob scene,” and what it’s like working with Hamm (a question she clearly gets a lot these days).     Q: Is directing and starring in your own independent film and then going to a Disney movie quite a unique transition? A: It is. But I had a great experience. If anything it was refreshing to be in the hands of the very capable director Craig (Gillespie). And Disney, I have never worked for Disney before but it was a tremendous experience. And Jon is a really good friend of mine. As a writer-director, I like being on other people’s sets. I am an actor first and foremost and I think being an actor for hire is how I learn, seeing other people’s sets ... Especially with this movie having sports elements, I’ve never seen anything like that. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to go to India. Q: You get to play the bridge between the young Indian men and the prototype- American sports agent.  A: I play the literal girl next door who is somewhat irrelevant initially and then becomes incredibly relevant in suturing that relationship between J.B. and Rinku and Dinesh. J.B. is kind of going down this straightaway of trying to find monetary gain from these investments he has brought back and he, with the help of my character, gets punched in the proverbial gut...’Hey check it out. This is so much more than monetary gain and the only way these boys will find success is if you respect that they are going through an emotional journey as well.’ Q: What did you like about the character of Brenda? A: I enjoy Brenda’s utter steadfast truth and her ability to express herself via tough love, which is something I relate to deeply in my own life. Q: It is such a cliche question, but millions of women would probably want to know what it’s like playing opposite Jon Hamm.  A: How do I answer that in a new way? Jon and I are good friends. We have known each other for a long time. He comes on (satirical TV series) ‘Children’s Hospital’ occasionally as a recurring, so he is very playful and fun. He is really goofy and hilarious and people probably know that somewhat from his SNL career... But he really is a comedy fan and great comedy player. In this film, he plays the straight man to a lot of fish-out-of-water elements, which I think is incredibly difficult and takes a comedic brain to know how to play the straight man with perfection. Q: Some might say you are a knockout, but in your film and this film you play somewhat disheveled, messy women.  A: I really enjoy playing characters who are realistically put together, from “In a World...,” playing Carol, the character I wrote for myself to depict, to Brenda who lives her life in scrubs and sweatpants.  I don’t walk around in stilettos and fancy dress all the time. That’s just not my life and I don’t feel comfortable that way. I enjoy playing characters I can relate to personally who aren’t ‘glam squad’ all the time. ‘Glam squad’ is fun sometimes, but I feel like I can breath a bit better in a character that speaks truth in her visual representation. Q: This might be your most high-profile role and a lot of people may get to know you with this role, right? A: It’s interesting to think about it that way. Because it’s Disney, it’s a very universally acceptable film for a lot of different demographics. This is the first time I am in a film I can say to any family member to go and check it out and I am not embarrassed by some weird boob scene or something. It’s safe.  It is incredibly sweet and it’s relatable for young relatives, older relatives and everything in between. That, for me, is a big deal.

The notes will be issued under Disney's existing indenture dated Sept.  24, 2001, and will be pari passu with all existing debt. Similar to existing  bonds, there are no financial covenants. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch believes Disney has the financial flexibility and capacity at the  current rating level to accommodate a higher level of share repurchases during  its fiscal year 2014 in a manner neutral to its credit profile. --The ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation that the company's share  repurchase and M&A; activity will likely exceed free cash flow (FCF) generation. --Disney is uniquely positioned to capitalize and monetize franchises and brands  across the company's various business segments and platforms, providing Disney  with a sustainable competitive advantage relative to its peers.  --Disney is well-positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities  presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience  fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape.  Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain consistent and  within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated leverage of  1.16x as of the LTM period ended March 31, 2014 is in line with fiscal year-end  2013 metrics. Going forward Fitch believes leverage will range between 1.2x and  1.4x during the ratings horizon after consideration of a modest increase in debt  levels related to the higher level of share repurchases. Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial policy as  the company increases the level of share repurchases during fiscal 2014 to range  between $6 billion and $8 billion. Through May 6, 2014, Disney has repurchased  58.2million shares of its common stock for approximately $4.3billion.  As of  March 29, 2014, the company had authorization to repurchase 116 million  additional shares.  Given the strength of Disney's underlying businesses, strong  liquidity position, and Fitch's FCF expectations, Disney has the financial  flexibility to accommodate the higher level of share repurchases in a manner  consistent with its current ratings. Additionally, in Fitch's estimation the  company maintains an appropriate balance between returning capital to  shareholders, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and investing in  the strategic needs of its business. Disney's operating profile positions it to generate meaningful levels of FCF  (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends),  providing the company with considerable financial flexibility at the current  ratings. Disney generated approximately $5.3 billion of FCF through the LTM  period ended March 31, 2014.  Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and  Resort segment is winding down, which will benefit the company's FCF generation.  Fitch anticipates that Disney will generate in excess of $4 billion of annual  FCF during the ratings horizon. Overall, the ratings reflect the company's leading market positions within its  core businesses. Further, Disney has a very consistent investment strategy that  is centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and content that is  leverageable across Disney's various platforms (cable and broadcast network,  studio, parks and resorts, and consumer products). Disney is uniquely  positioned, relative to its peers to capitalize and monetize its internally or  externally developed franchises and brands, which in turn strengthens Disney's  operating and credit profile and provides the company with a sustainable  competitive advantage.  Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks underlines the company's ratings,  and its operating profile continues to benefit from the stable, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile and high operating margin characteristics  attributable to its cable network business. Disney's cable networks generate a  greater portion of total revenue and EBITDA, resulting in incremental stability  in the total revenue and FCF profile. Rising programming costs, particularly  sports programming, and Disney's ability to pass the higher costs along to  multi-channel video programming distributors (MPVDs) will remain a significant  risk to the company's operating profile. However, Fitch believes that Disney is  in a strong position to retain pricing power going forward as its collection of  top-tier cable networks continue to command audience and ratings and be a  must-carry for the MVPDs. In addition, Disney has in large part successfully  matched the tenor of its long-term sports programming rights with the terms of  its various affiliation agreements with the MVPDs.  Ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the company's businesses, particularly  Parks & Resorts (31% of Disney's year-to-date revenue), consumer products (8%),  and the advertising portion of broadcast and cable networks (19%). Should  macroeconomic volatility return, Fitch expects these cyclical businesses to be  under renewed pressure but that the company's credit and financial profile will  likely remain within expectations for the current ratings. The ratings  incorporate Fitch's expectation that the Studio Entertainment business, will  remain volatile and low margin, similar to that of its peers, given the  hit-driven nature. The decline of home entertainment sales, which is the window  in which many films become profitable, is becoming less of a concern amid the  growth of higher-margin digital distribution, and should be accommodated within  current ratings.  Disney is well-positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities  presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience  fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. Fitch expects  alternative distribution platforms to generate incremental demand for  high-quality content across all major end-markets (broadcast, cable networks and  subscription video on demand) and large, well-capitalized content providers,  such as Disney, to remain crucial to the industry.  Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and are  supported by significant FCF generation as well as $6 billion of aggregate  available borrowing capacity (as of March 31, 2014) under three credit  facilities. Commitments under these facilities support the company's $6 billion  CP program and expire during March 2015 ($1.5 billion), June 2017 ($2.25  billion) and March 2019 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had  approximately $4.1 billion of cash on hand as of March 31, 2014. Scheduled  maturities (pro forma for the announced repayment of debt and CP) are  well-laddered and manageable considering FCF generation expectations and access  to capital markets.  Approximately $2.8 billion (including $2.3 billion of CP) of debt is scheduled  to mature during fiscal 2014 followed by approximately $2 billion annually  during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 (Fiscal year ends September). Fitch does not  expect debt reduction going forward.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.  However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more  conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretional  actions of Disney's management rather than by operating performance, reflecting  the company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase  leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will  likely lead to a negative rating action. Total debt at March 31, 2014 was $15.6 billion and consisted of: --$2.3 billion of CP; --$12.2 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from December  2014 - 2093; --$256 million of debt related to Hong Kong Disneyland, which is non-recourse  back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption that the  company would back the loan payments;  --$554 million of foreign currency-denominated debt; --$318 million of other debt. Fitch currently rates Disney as follows: The Walt Disney Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of  any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats  the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the  absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney  Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch  does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'  category investment-grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial  policies, and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney  Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if it appeared  there was heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade  (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

724,DIS,Brad Pitt gets restraining order against Ukrainian prankster,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Police on Thursday issued a restraining order against the Ukrainian prankster who struck actor Brad Pitt in the face as he signed autographs at the Los Angeles premiere of “Maleficent,” the new Disney film starring Pitt’s partner Angelina Jolie. Pitt, 50, sought an emergency protective order against 25-year-old Vitalii Sediuk after he leaped over a fence at the “Maleficent” premiere and hit him, Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Officer Wendy Reyes said.  Sediuk, who is a television personality in his own country, remained in police custody on Thursday, pending payment of $20,000 bail. Pitt was unhurt after being struck.  The prankster has become infamous for crashing celebrity red carpets and events, most recently breaching a red carpet at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival in France to try and climb under actress America Ferrera’s dress as she posed for photographers, before he was ousted by security. In previous exploits, Sediuk has hugged actor Leonardo DiCaprio around the crotch at a Santa Barbara Film Festival event; stormed the stage during singer Adele’s Grammy acceptance speech, and was slapped by Will Smith after kissing the actor at a Moscow premiere.

727,DIS,"'Maleficent' casts $70 million spell over box office, halts 'X-Men' uprising","LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - “Maleficent,” Walt Disney’s special-effects laden take on “Sleeping Beauty’s” wicked fairy godmother, captivated moviegoers, collecting $70 million in ticket sales to win the North American weekend box office stakes. The movie starring Angelina Jolie as the black-robed villain finished far ahead of last week’s winner, “X-Men: Days of Future Past,” which took $32.6 million at U.S. and Canadian theaters. Seth MacFarlane’s western comedy “A Million Ways to Die in the West” was third with $17.1 million for the three days from Friday to Sunday, according to box office tracking firm Rentrak. Produced for $180 million, “Maleficent” received mixed reviews but opened strongly with $4.2 million on Thursday night  and conjured up more than 80 percent of advance ticket sales for the weekend, according to movie ticketing site Fandango. The film is the latest in a line of reimagined classics, following “Alice in Wonderland” in 2010 and “Oz the Great and Powerful” in 2013. Industry experts forecast the film would open with $55 million, according to the movie site Box Office Mojo.    “We’re very excited with this start,” said Dave Hollis, head of distribution for Walt Disney Studios, noting it hoped for an opening of around $60 million. “Maleficent” took in another $100 at overseas box offices. Hollis said momentum built through weekend on positive word of mouth. With schools beginning to let out and a “general absence of family product in this marketplace,” Disney was optimistic for the film continuing its strong performance. “X-Men: Days of Future Past,” with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the seventh installment based on the Marvel Comic  series, has collected more than $162 million in sales in domestic theaters since its May 23 release and has generated $500 million worldwide in just two weeks, distributor Fox said. “A Million Ways to Die in the West,” MacFarlane’s second time directing a live action film after his 2012 hit “Ted” about a foul-mouthed toy bear, disappointed in its opening weekend. Studio and industry projections had anticipated a haul of about $20 million to $25 million for the modestly budgeted ($40 million) film which stars MacFarlane along with Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, Sarah Silverman and Neil Patrick Harris.    The film received tepid reviews with only 33 percent of 128 critics giving it a “fresh” rating on the Rotten Tomatoes site. “Godzilla,” the latest installment of the 60-year-old series about a giant lizard, was fourth with $12.2 million. Made for   $160 million, the special effects infused film has generated $175 million domestically since it was released on May 16. “Blended,” a romantic comedy pairing Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in their third film, was fifth with $8.4 million. They play single parents stuck at a resort in Africa.    “X-Men: Days of Future Past” was distributed by Fox, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox. Universal, a unit of Comcast, released “A Million Ways to Die in the West.” “Godzilla” and “Blended” were distributed by Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner.

732,DIS,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Harrison Ford injured on set of 'Star Wars: Episode VII',"(Corrects sourcing in paragraph 4 from hospital representative to film publicist) June 12 (Reuters) - Actor Harrison Ford was injured on the set of “Star Wars: Episode VII” on Thursday and taken to a hospital for treatment, a Disney representative said. Ford, 71, hurt his ankle while filming at Pinewood Studios,  on the outskirts of London, Disney spokesman Paul Roeder said. Filming will continue on schedule while Ford recovers. The actor was taken to nearby John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Thames Valley Police said on its official Twitter feed that police responded to an incident where “a 71-year-old man was airlifted to hospital with injuries not believed to be life-threatening.” A second tweet said the mishap “is believed to have involved a garage door.” Vanessa Davies, a unit publicist for the “Star Wars” film, said any reports that Ford suffered other injuries as well were untrue. The actor is reprising his role as Han Solo in the highly anticipated Disney reboot of the “Star Wars” franchise, directed by J.J. Abrams and scheduled for release in December 2015. It is the first of three new films that will continue the saga created by George Lucas, after Disney purchased Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.05 billion. The film’s plot has been kept a secret, but Abrams has said the cast will include Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Andy Serkis and Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o.

733,DIS,Disney sees Infinity video game hitting $1 billion in revenue,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co expects revenue from its 10-month-old Infinity video game to reach $1 billion even as rivals also combine physical toys with video games, Jimmy Pitaro, president of the company’s interactive unit, said in an interview. Disney launched Infinity in August to help turn around its interactive gaming unit, which lost $1.4 billion from fiscal year 2008 to 2013. In an overhaul in March, the division laid off about one-quarter of the workforce, cut the number of games it develops and focused its advertising more on the fast-changing mobile market. A month ago, Disney reported global revenue of $550 million for Infinity. Sales of the game helped the interactive unit post a $14 million profit for the quarter that ended in March, its third consecutive quarterly profit. “We will be a billion-dollar franchise,” Pitaro said of Infinity in an interview on Wednesday at the E3 video game conference. He declined to provide a time frame. A Disney spokeswoman said Pitaro’s projection was “just the beginning of what we expect it to do. This is a long-term game franchise with enormous revenue potential.” Infinity lets users play with characters from Disney and Pixar films such as Anna and Elsa from “Frozen,” Captain Jack Sparrow from “Pirates of the Caribbean” and Lightning McQueen from “Cars.”  The company is launching the next version of the game, “Disney Infinity 2.0: Marvel Super Heroes” in the fall, bringing in Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man and others.  Infinity competes with Activision Blizzard Inc’s “Skylanders” franchise that first successfully introduced the concept of toys coming to life on screen when placed on an electronic base.    Since its launch in October 2011 until the end of 2013, “Skylanders” has surpassed $2 billion in revenue. This week at E3, Nintendo Co Ltd announced it would release “amiibo” toys of characters such as Mario with a chip that activates them in games when placed on the GamePad controller of its Wii U console. Disney also plans more mobile “Star Wars” games before its scheduled December 2015 release of the seventh movie in the classic sci-fi series, Pitaro said. Disney also has a multi-year licensing deal with Electronic Arts Inc to develop a different line of “Star Wars” games.

735,DIS,"Spielberg's Cold War thriller, Dahl adaptation get release dates","LOS ANGELES, June 16 (Reuters) - DreamWorks film studio has given release dates of 2015 and 2016 for director Steven Spielberg’s two next films, Walt Disney Co said in a statement on Monday. Spielberg’s untitled Cold War spy thriller starring Tom Hanks is set to be released on Oct. 16, 2015, and reunites the actor and director who previously collaborated on war film “Saving Private Ryan” and crime drama “Catch Me If You Can.” Spielberg’s take on “The BFG,” based on British author Roald Dahl’s 1982 book, is scheduled for release on July 1, 2016. The Cold War thriller is based on the story of James Donovan, the attorney who helped negotiate the release of U.S. spy plane pilot Gary Powers whose plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960. The latest version of the original script by Matt Charman is by filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen. “The BFG” is about a friendly giant who adventures with a young girl and the Queen of England to capture evil man-eating giants. Both films follow Spielberg’s 2012 historical film “Lincoln,” for which he earned a best director Oscar nomination and for which Daniel Day-Lewis won the Academy Award for his portrayal of the Civil War president.

737,DIS,'Looper' filmmaker Rian Johnson to write/direct 'Star Wars: Episode VIII',"LOS ANGELES, June 20 (Reuters) - “Looper” filmmaker Rian Johnson will write and direct “Star Wars: Episode VIII,” the second installment in the new trilogy of “Star Wars” films produced by Walt Disney Co, a source with knowledge of the plans said on Friday. Johnson, 40, who also wrote and directed 2005’s “Brick” and 2008’s “The Brothers Bloom,” will also write the initial script for the third installment of the trilogy, “Episode IX.” A Disney spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. “Episode VIII” is the second of three films that Disney announced after purchasing “Star Wars” creator George Lucas’ Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.05 billion, and will follow “Star Wars: Episode VII,” currently in production with director J.J. Abrams. The films are expected to expand the saga that was first released in 1977 and has become embedded in pop culture. Disney will also produce stand-alone “Star Wars” films that will be released between the three new trilogy films, the first of which will be directed by “Godzilla” filmmaker Gareth Edwards. Fans of the franchise have been avidly following production developments on “Episode VII,” which is currently being filmed in multiple locations including the historic Pinewood Studios outside London, and scheduled for release in December 2015. Disney released the film’s leading cast members in May, which will see the return of franchise veterans Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill, as well as newcomers Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong’o, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Gwendoline Christie and Daisy Ridley.

738,DIS,Univision sees value in holding off on sale,"(Reuters) - Univision Communications has had several informal sale talks in the past year, but the company’s board could take a year or longer to decide on a potential deal, as the company seeks to boost profits and pay down debt, people familiar with the matter said.  Owners of the Spanish-language U.S. media company think it could fetch more by further improving its earnings ahead of an initial public offering or sale in 2015, according to three people familiar with the board’s thinking. Univision’s reluctance to commit to a formal sale process at this stage highlights the challenges that the company’s potential suitors face in winning what is widely considered to be one of the media industry’s most highly coveted businesses.  The company held preliminary talks with CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) earlier this year, but those talks were preliminary in nature, the people said.   The board, including members who represent private equity firms that bought Univision for $12.3 billion in 2007, could still decide to sell if Univision fetches an offer that is too good to turn down, said one of the people. For now Univision is focused on paying down its $9.2 billion in debt through its rising cash flow, that person added. New York-based Univision was taken private by a group of buyout firms including Haim Saban’s Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners. Mexican media company Televisa owns an 8 percent stake in Univision and has bought debt that could be converted into a stake of up to 30 percent.

739,DIS,DEALTALK-Univision sees value in holding off on sale,"(For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on ) By Ronald Grover  and Liana B. Baker June 20(Reuters) - Univision Communications has had several informal sale talks in the past year, but the company’s board could take a year or longer to decide on a potential deal, as the company seeks to boost profits and pay down debt, people familiar with the matter said. Owners of the Spanish-language U.S. media company think it could fetch more by further improving its earnings ahead of an initial public offering or sale in 2015, according to three people familiar with the board’s thinking. Univision’s reluctance to commit to a formal sale process at this stage highlights the challenges that the company’s potential suitors face in winning what is widely considered to be one of the media industry’s most highly coveted businesses. The company held preliminary talks with CBS Corp and Time Warner Inc earlier this year, but those talks were preliminary in nature, the people said. The board, including members who represent private equity firms that bought Univision for $12.3 billion in 2007, could still decide to sell if Univision fetches an offer that is too good to turn down, said one of the people. For now Univision is focused on paying down its $9.2 billion in debt through its rising cash flow, that person added. New York-based Univision was taken private by a group of buyout firms including Haim Saban’s Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners. Mexican media company Televisa owns an 8 percent stake in Univision and has bought debt that could be converted into a stake of up to 30 percent. It holds three board seats and also collects hundreds of millions in licensing revenue and royalties every year from Univision which airs a large chunk of its programming. “It is unclear if Televisa would be willing to divest its stake or even acquire the remainder of the company at this juncture,” Barclays analyst Danish Agboatwala said.

ESPN, which is owned by Walt Disney Co, has been setting U.S. viewing records during the World Cup in Brazil where some games have aired during the U.S. prime time. Sunday’s match became the highest-rated soccer match ever in the United States, edging out the 1999’s Women’s World Cup final of USA vs. China, where 18 million people tuned in to watch on Disney’s broadcast network ABC. The Sunday match surpassed the U.S.-Ghana game last Monday, which pulled in 11 million viewers. [ID:nL2N0OY1P5] The game also attracted 6.5 million viewers for Spanish language broadcaster Univision [UVN.UL], making it the most viewed U.S. World Cup match in the network’s history, and beating last Monday’s U.S.-Ghana game which garnered 4.8 million viewers. On Sunday, the U.S. team had nearly secured a come-from-behind victory with goals from Jermaine Jones and Clint Dempsey, until Portugal substitute Silvestre Varela scored with a flying header from a Cristiano Ronaldo cross. [ID: nL6N0P400P] The next match for the United States vs. Germany will air Thursday at 11:30 am Eastern on ESPN. While soccer is on the upswing in the United States, it still lacks the television audience numbers of some other sports. The 18.2 million viewers for the U.S.-Portugal World Cup game on Sunday compares with 26.6 million ESPN viewers for college football’s BCS National Championship on Jan. 6.

741,DIS,"With Snoopy film in the works, fund managers bet on Iconix","NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - Fund managers are making a big bet on Snoopy, Lucy and Charlie Brown. With a big-budget Peanuts film set to appear in theaters next year, an unusually high number of U.S. mutual funds have been buying shares of Iconix Brand Group Inc, the little-known company that owns 80 percent of the rights to the characters. The number of new funds owning shares swelled 36 percent last quarter, according to data from fund tracker Morningstar. That is a high number for a company with a market value of $1.9 billion and a slowing core business, fund experts say. Few consumers have ever heard of the New York-based company, though they are likely familiar with its roster of 35 brands, ranging from mass-market staples like Joe Boxer and Ed Hardy to Cannon linens and Material Girl, the line of apparel and accessories from Madonna and her daughter. But with many of its U.S. retail partners, such as Target, Macy’s and Sears Holdings Corp, struggling with falling traffic and weak consumer demand, Iconix is looking elsewhere to expand. “With what is happening in America we don’t see large growth there over the next couple of years but we do see stability,” Chief Executive Neil Cole, the brother of fashion designer Kenneth Cole, told analysts after the company reported its quarterly results in April. Should the Peanuts movie prove to be a hit, it could help Iconix double its revenues, which hit $433 million in 2013, Cole told analysts. The company declined to comment for this story. Already, the brand has paid some dividends: Walt Disney Co’s  ABC network renewed its long-standing contract to air the popular Peanuts holiday specials 18 months before it came due. Iconix recognized $17 million of the $21 million contract in the first quarter, which helped push revenue up 11 percent to $116.1 million and non-diluted adjusted earnings per share to 72 cents, a 33 percent increase from the same time last year. There is no telling how well the movie will be received, of course. For every hit like “The Lego Movie,” which has brought in $256.7 million at the U.S. box office, according to Box Office Mojo, there has been a film like 2013’s “The Lone Ranger,” whose $89 million in U.S. box-office take paled against an estimated cost of $215 million. Though the percentage that Iconix could reap from next year’s film was not disclosed, the Peanuts brand should command a premium, said Charles W. Grimes, a Norwalk, Connecticut, attorney who specializes in character licensing and has worked with properties including Archie comics and Disney characters. It would “not be inconceivable” for the company to get an upfront fee of $10 million or more for the theatrical release of the film, plus additional fees once the box office draw topped certain milestones, Grimes said. Iconix would also likely get between 7 and 14 percent of film merchandise tie-ins, such as T-shirts or toys, he said. Sesame Street Workshop, the non-profit company that owns the license to Elmo and the other Sesame Street characters, made $46.5 million from licensing in the year that ended June 30, 2013, according to its most recent financial statement. “Peanuts has a huge growth ahead of it,” said Cliff Greenberg, who manages $5.5 billion in the Baron Small Cap fund  and has been buying shares of Iconix on dips in expectations that it will continue to expand its entertainment division. Chris Terry, an analyst at Dallas-based Hodges Capital, said his firm began buying shares approximately six months ago on expectations that the Peanuts license will pay off. There is caution, however, in some quarters. The lack of clear numbers regarding Peanut’s contribution gives Steve Marotta, an analyst at C.L. King & Associates who covers the stock, pause. “The company is a bit of black box,” he said. He estimates that Peanuts is the most important individual brand to the company, followed by Mossimo and Candie’s. Nevertheless, he has a “buy” rating on the stock, and a target price of $47, slightly above the median target price of $46.50 among analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters. Shares closed at $42.71 Wednesday, and trade at a forward price to earnings multiple of 15.3, a full point lower than the 16.7 average among apparel companies. The company now largely depends on overseas licenses for growth and has several joint ventures to sell its brands throughout Asia, Marotta said. Eric Beder, an analyst at Brean Capital, said he has a “hold” rating because Iconix has not bought any new brands this year after typically adding two or three annually. “The company doesn’t usually beat by much and usually never misses,” he said. “But right now it’s a question of finding the right deals and that isn’t happening.”   (Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Linda Stern and Leslie Adler)",6262014,http://www.reuters.com/article/iconix-brand-grp-retail-investors/with-snoopy-film-in-the-works-fund-managers-bet-on-iconix-idUSL2N0P70GY20140626

News of the stoppage comes after Disney initially said filming would continue on schedule while Ford recovered. But shooting is on track to wrap up in the fall, the studio said, and the release date remains December 2015. “In August, the team will take a brief two-week hiatus while adjustments to the current production schedule are made as actor Harrison Ford recovers from a leg injury,” Disney said in a   statement posted on Sunday on the website StarWars.com.

The best actor Oscar-nominee for his role in  “Witness” in 1986 is reprising his role as Han Solo in the film that is being directed by J.J. Abrams. Actress Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill will also reprise their roles in the film and will be joined by Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o, Andy Serkis, Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac.  Disney also announced that two new actors, Briton Pip Andersen and American Crystal Clarke, who were selected from more than 37,000 people during open casting calls, will have roles in the film.

744,DIS,NY lawmakers set to clamp down on Times Square's caped crusaders,"NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - Cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse and Spider-man have been adored by generations of children, but their costumed counterparts who roam New York City’s Times Square are more a public nuisance, New York City lawmakers said on Wednesday. Indeed, tighter restrictions are likely ahead for the people who don the oversized costumes and pose for pictures with tourists for a fee, City Council members said at a meeting of the Times Square Alliance. The unlicensed workers, who are under scrutiny in the wake of unsavory incidents with tourists, can be very aggressive, said Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer. “They accost people,” she said. “They ask to take a picture. They ask for money. They chase people to the ATM sometimes for money.” Last month, a worker dressed as Spider-Man was fined $370 for punching a tourist who had pelted him with snow. Last year, a costumed Cookie Monster was arrested for shoving a 2-year-old child whose mother failed to tip him, and in 2012, a man dressed as Elmo was arrested for an anti-Semitic tirade. The council is likely to put forward legislation to regulate the characters but would protect their right to artistic expression, Brewer said. City lawmakers have said that dressing up in a costume in Times Square could be protected under the constitutional right to freedom of speech. Last year, legislation to regulate the characters, including licensing requirements, failed to pass the City Council. Brewer said that companies such as the Walt Disney Co , which holds the trademark for Mickey and Minnie Mouse,  and Japan’s Sanrio Co which holds the trademark for Hello Kitty, could take legal action. Lawmakers at the meeting said the number of characters has proliferated. On a recent Saturday, the Alliance surveyed the tourist-heavy Times Square and counted 76 costumed performers. The most popular characters were Elmo - a character on the children’s television show Sesame Street, and Mickey and Minnie Mouse, it said. A recent poll found that about one in six New Yorkers had had an unpleasant experience with the characters, the Alliance said, while two in five businesses and individuals it includes as members had had bad run-ins with the characters.

750,DIS,Fox-Time Warner deal could bring the game to ESPN,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox’s plan to buy Time Warner could create an upheaval in the sports television world, creating the first meaningful challenge to Walt Disney Co’s ESPN. Time Warner’s board has rejected an $80 billion bid, but Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch is unlikely to walk away quickly. A deal would bring him college basketball’s “March Madness” championship tournament, prime time National Basketball Association (NBA) games, and Major League Baseball (MLB) games. Fox’s sports rights include National Football League games, professional baseball games and NASCAR racing. In 2015 it gets the rights to women’s World Cup soccer and in 2018 the men’s World Cup. Disney’s ESPN, with Monday Night Football, Major League Baseball games, NBA games and college football, will still be the team to beat, but for once there might be a match.  “You start to put it all together and you create a significant competitor to ESPN for ratings and advertising dollars,” said Marc Ganis, a sports TV consultant.  In an age of DVRs and on demand viewing, sports stands out for its ability to draw television audiences which are large and watch live, two traits crucial for selling advertising, says Ed Desser, a former president of NBA Television and New Media Ventures, who advises teams and league’s on their TV contracts. “It’s TV’s growth engine,” he says. “It drives subscriber fees and keeps people watching.” Ganis speculates that some key Time Warner sports, such as its professional basketball doubleheaders, could move from TNT to Fox Sports 1. Fox Sports 1 already airs major league baseball, motor sports, mixed marital arts and college football and basketball games from the larger conferences. The additions could allow Fox Sports 1, now in about 90 million homes, to add subscribers and raise the affiliate fees from cable and satellite operators that make up the majority of its revenues. ESPN is in more than 100 million homes, not too far ahead of Fox. However, ESPN currently can charge cable companies $6.04 per month for each subscriber, according to data compiled by consultant SNL Kagan.  By comparison, Fox Sports 1 is paid 68 cents for each of its subscribers. Thanks in part to its National Basketball Association games, TNT gets $1.48 per subscriber.  Murdoch could also use Time Warner’s collection of channels to outbid competitors for key sporting events, spreading the costs among its Fox network and cable channels, said Derek Baine, Research Director at SNL Kagan. “One of the things driving this deal is that Fox will be more aggressively bidding on sports rights, so this will give them more fire power,” Baine said in an email. “Like NBCU with the Olympics, they can spread games across multiple networks.” Combining the two would also eliminate a major buyer of sports programming, which may raise concerns at the U.S. Justice Department when it reviews a deal, said Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School. Carstensen says the review may focus on specific parts of the content business — movies, sports, news — rather than a new company’s entire offering of content. “My guess is that enforcers are less likely to be concerned by the overall programming,” he said. “If you’re not going to take the general market view, you may have to divest some sports programming.” Fox also will have to convince sports leagues or conferences to alter existing contracts to shift around the sports, said Desser. Contracts usually tightly prescribe where games can be shown, and leagues are loath to change them for fear of upsetting other TV rights holders. Fox already airs NBA games on many of its 22 regional sports cable channels, he says. “But anything is possible, and deals get rewritten,” he said. “Sports are such a pure growth engine that they may try.” ",7172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-timewarner-fox-sports-analysis/fox-time-warner-deal-could-bring-the-game-to-espn-idUSKBN0FM09820140717
751,DIS,UPDATE 1-'Apes' rules North American box office for second straight weekend,"(Adds details, quotes, background) By Lisa Richwine and Chris Michaud LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Sci-fi sequel “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” beat a new horror flick, an animated family film and an adult comedy to keep its grip on the U.S. and Canadian box office title for a second straight weekend. “Apes” collected $36 million in domestic ticket sales from Friday through Sunday, according to estimates from Rentrak, only the second summer film to top the box office for two consecutive weekends. Low-budget horror film “The Purge: Anarchy” finished in second place with $28.4 million. Another new big release, Walt Disney Co’s animated “Planes: Fire and Rescue,” grabbed third place with $18 million,  while the comedy “Sex Tape” took in $15 million for the No. 4 spot. “Apes,” a sequel to the 2011 franchise reboot “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” has rung up some $242 million worldwide since its July 11 debut, according to distributor 20th Century Fox, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox. The movie stars Andy Serkis as Caesar, a brainy ape who leads the interactions with humans in the battle for dominance. “The Purge: Anarchy,” a follow-up to 2013 summer hit “The Purge,” tells the story of a couple whose car breaks down at the start of an annual purge, a 12-hour period in which crime is legal. Produced for $9 million, it ranks as another successful, inexpensive movie produced by horror filmmaker Jason Blum. “This is going to be a super-profitable film for the studio,” said Nikki Rocco, president for domestic distribution at Universal Pictures, the Comcast Corp unit that released the film. Noting that “the market has been depressed for these kinds of films,” Rocco added that the solid $28 million opening “was better than we would have hoped for.” The $50 million “Planes: Fire and Rescue,” another sequel, features the voice of U.S. comedian and actor Dane Cook as a crop dusting plane that joins forces with a team of rescue vehicles to fight a wildfire, and follows last summer’s “Planes,” a spinoff of Disney’s blockbuster “Cars” films. “Sex Tape” stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel as a married couple who accidentally upload a racy video of themselves onto the Internet. The movie cost about $40 million, according to Sony Corp’s movie studio, which distributed it. “We hoped for a bit more domestically,” said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution at Sony, referring to the opening. “But at the end of the day we’ll be profitable,” he added, noting that, internationally, the film looked to be doing business on par with the earlier Diaz comedy hit, “Bad Teacher.” Rounding out the top five, the summer hit “Transformers: Age of Extinction,” starring Mark Wahlberg and a cast of form-changing robots, grossed $10 million for a U.S. total of $227 million.

753,DIS,'Guardians' rallies summer box office with $11.2 million opening night,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The “Guardians of the Galaxy” stormed into the box office with a $11.2 million opening night, Walt Disney Co said on Friday, and could outperform expectations if it keeps drawing viewers with a new leading man, strong reviews and social media buzz.  “Guardians,” the newest franchise from the Disney-owned Marvel universe, follows a rogue band of misfits on an intergalactic space adventure. As the Guardians try to save the galaxy from a planet-destroying orb coveted by evil warlords, they may also “save the summer” for a slumping movie industry if the film exceeds expectations, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Rentrak. “This is a movie that everyone has been waiting for,” Dergarabedian said. Hollywood’s summer box office has been in a funk, producing fewer blockbusters than usual and putting ticket sales 20 percent behind last year at $2.93 billion.  Early projections for the “Guardians” opening weekend at the U.S. and Canadian box office were estimated to reach between $65 million to $80 million. Dergarabedian said the movie could beat those forecasts especially if Saturday’s attendance holds strong. The film is benefiting from positive reviews and social media chatter, and Dergarabedian said actor Chris Pratt in the leading role of Star-Lord, is a “newly minted movie star, like a young Harrison Ford in ‘Indiana Jones,’ the lovable rogue and antihero who becomes the hero.” The success of “Guardians” could encourage studios to reconsider August as a key movie release month, he said. In past years, the prime summer release slot has been earlier. Thursday night earnings for “Guardians” at the U.S. box office overtook the April opening of Marvel’s “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” which made $10.2 million on its first night and went on to make $96.2 million in the United States and Canada over its first weekend.

755,DIS,Marvel's 'Guardians' rockets to $94 million domestic debut,"(Reuters) - “Guardians of the Galaxy,” Walt Disney Co’s offbeat space adventure featuring extraterrestrial misfits and a talking raccoon, made $94 million in ticket sales this weekend, setting a record for an August film opening. The film’s strong beginning, however, isn’t likely to jumpstart a lackluster summer box office season.     The 3D movie, which stars lesser-known characters in Disney’s Marvel comic book universe, added $66.4 million from international markets, for a global debut of $160.4 million, Disney said on Sunday.      “Guardians” outgunned last weekend’s leader, the science-fiction thriller “Lucy” that collected another $18.3 million in sales at domestic theaters, according to estimates from Rentrak. “Lucy” stars Scarlett Johansson as a woman with a super-powered brain.      “Get On Up,” a biography of the soul singer James Brown, was third with $14 million in its first weekend in theaters.        “Guardians” stars an ensemble cast that includes Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper and Chris Pratt. After  positive reviews, the film was the year’s biggest Thursday night opening with $11.2 million in sales starting with 7 p.m. shows.     Even before the film’s opening, Walt Disney said it was planning a sequel for release in July 2017.     Head of distribution for Walt Disney Studios Dave Hollis attributed the strong performance of “Guardians” to a combination of momentum started by “Transformers: Age of Extinction” in June, skillful marketing, and strong reviews.     “It starts with a great movie, and certainly the marketing was inspired,” Hollis said.     Disney had marketed the film’s lighter moments in trailers and commercials, including a machinegun-firing raccoon, to expand its popularity beyond traditional Marvel movie fans.  The movie features a soundtrack of music from the 1970s, including the songs “Hooked on a Feeling” and “Spirit in the Sky.”     “Transformers: Age of Extinction,” just passed $1 billion in global box office returns, according to Paramount Pictures.     “Guardians” performance, which beat Hollywood forecasts of a $65 million to $80 million opening, are not likely to energize the summer box office, however, as ticket sales are currently running 18 percent behind last year, according to Rentrak.     “It doesn’t end it but it’s certainly a step in the right direction,” said Rentrak’s senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian about the slump.     It only gave the overall summer box office a two percent lift, he said.      “Hercules,” starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as the legendary muscle man, was fourth for the weekend with $10.7 million.     “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” was fifth with $8.7 million. The film has totaled more than $189.3 million in sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak.     “Lucy” and “Get On Up” were released by Universal, a unit of Comcast Corp.       Fox, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox, distributed “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.” “Hercules” and “Transformers: Age of Extinction” were released by Paramount Pictures, a Viacom unit.

757,DIS,"Disney profit jumps thanks to movies, parks, products","(Reuters) - Media company Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) quarterly profit blew past Wall Street expectations, with a muscular performance from its “Captain America” movie, higher attendance at U.S. theme parks and brisk sales of merchandise tied to mega-hit “Frozen.” Net income rose to $2.2 billion in the quarter ended on June 28, up 22 percent from the year-ago period, the company said on Tuesday. Diluted earnings per share reached a record $1.28, beating analysts’ average forecast of $1.17 in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey. Revenue rose to 8 percent $12.47 billion. Shares of Disney rose 15 cents in after-hours trading to $86.90 after closing at $86.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company’s earnings per share for the first three quarters of fiscal 2014 were  greater than any previous full fiscal year. “Our strategy of building strong brands and franchises continues to create great value across our company,” Iger said in a statement. Operating income at Disney’s media networks division was flat at $2.3 billion and declined 7 percent for the unit’s cable networks segment, due to a decrease at sports juggernaut ESPN. ESPN fell in part from higher programming and production costs for Major League Baseball and the FIFA World Cup, and the absence of ESPN UK, which had been sold, Disney said. At the movie studio, operating income more than doubled to $411 million, thanks to the success of “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” and “Maleficent” in theaters and home entertainment sales for “Frozen.”  The theme parks unit reported operating income of $848 million, up 23 percent from the prior year and driven by the company’s U.S. operations. Both attendance and guest spending rose at domestic parks. The company is drawing up plans to add a “far greater ‘Star Wars’ presence” at its theme parks, Iger said, and hopes to announce details next year. He assured analysts the next “Star Wars” movie, “Episode VII,” remains set for release on December 18, 2015, despite an injury to star Harrison Ford.     Operating income for consumer products rose 25 percent to $273 million thanks to increases at Disney retail stores and in its licensing business for products related to “Frozen,” the Disney Channel, “Spider-Man” and “Planes.” Disney’s interactive gaming unit reported its fourth consecutive quarterly profit with help from sales of its Disney Infinity toy-and-game combo. Operating income for the unit totaled $29 million. Analysts asked Iger if he felt the need to acquire new companies to increase Disney’s scale as other media companies plan mergers.

761,DIS,Disney toy division's focus on franchises makes it a star,"(Reuters) - Shoppers entering a Walt Disney Co retail store these days can see company CEO Bob Iger’s franchise strategy on display: walls packed with products linked to the company’s famous characters, ranging from Mickey and Minnie to “Guardians of the Galaxy,” Iron Man and Doc McStuffins. Ten years after being sold off and six years after Disney bought them back, Disney’s 336 retail stores have helped make its consumer products division among the fastest-growing of the media company’s five segments. In the quarter that ended in June, the unit earned $273 million, a 25 percent increase from a year ago.  It was the unit’s fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, Iger said when the company announced its results on Tuesday. Iger’s franchise strategy focuses on making larger-budget films like “Maleficent” that stand out in a crowd. Three years ago, he dispatched Bob Chapek, a veteran of the movie studio, to run the consumer products division, where he’s done much the same thing.  Chapek organized the unit around franchises, rather than categories such as footwear or lunch boxes.  “Consumers know that their children love a specific Disney franchise, whether it be Doc McStuffins, Frozen, or Minnie Mouse,” Chapek said. Parents think “I want to buy Doc McStuffins,” he said, before considering the type of product. Iger’s franchise strategy is the reason that over the past eight years the company paid $15 billion to buy Pixar, Marvel and George Lucas’ Lucasfilm “Star Wars” factory. Iger directed the company’s movie studio to focus on fewer films built around franchises. Part of Chapek’s work at consumer products, which operates the Disney stores and licenses characters, is building on existing franchises. The company worked with licensee Hasbro to create 12-inch-tall Titan Heroes, from its “Avengers” line of figures, after research by Hasbro in Latin America showed customers wanted bigger toys.  “People who wouldn’t otherwise be buying into the action figure category are now buying,” Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner said. The consumer products unit will be Disney’s fastest-growing segment over the next five years, said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger, who predicts earnings will grow at 13 percent compounded annual growth rate through fiscal 2018. New ideas from consumer-product staff include international dolls from Disney’s “It’s a Small World” ride and selling furry Tsum Tsum characters from a Disney video game. Chapek’s strategy involves some risk-taking, said Stephen Berman, chief executive of Disney licensee Jakks Pacific. For Doc McStuffins, toys were in the market four months after the TV premiere, rather than waiting the typical 18 months to see if it was a hit. The bet was right on.  Sales of Doc McStuffins toys helped retail sales for the Disney Junior preschool business double to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013. “He’s taking a risk, but it’s a calculated risk,” Berman said. “Who could have figured McStuffins would be as big as it’s become?” The unit also is creating new franchises from book publishing. In May, it released the first in the “Deep Blue” mermaid series along with a song and music videos. In January it will launch “The Zodiac Legacy” thriller series from Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee. Not every Disney product is a mega-hit in toyland. Sales of products related to 2011 film “Cars 2” were big, but not as high as licensees expected, said Needham & Co analyst Sean McGowan. While its wide range of hot-selling toys is impressive, “not all of them work that well,” he said.

Toby Scammell, a former associate at California investment firm, Madrone Capital Partners, admitted in April to illegally making $192,000 in August 2009 by purchasing stock options to buy Marvel stock just before Marvel’s acquisition by Disney, where his girlfriend was working. In addition to the prison sentence, U.S. District Judge James Otero in Los Angeles ordered Scammell to pay restitution of about $122,494 to the victim broker-dealers. Scammell earlier had been ordered to pay civil penalties and interest of $800,985 in a civil action filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Scammell admitted that he had learned that Disney planned to acquire a company “that people would recognize right away” from his then-girlfriend, who was working as an extern at Disney in the summer of 2009. Later, Scammell learned from a supervisor at his then-employer that Disney had earlier been interested in acquiring Marvel. Scammell used the information to acquire 659 call options to purchase Marvel stock for $5,465, according to prosecutors. Immediately after Disney’s public announcement of the deal, Scammell sold his options, realizing more than $192,000 in profits. Scammell’s attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.

Pandora’s shares rose more than nine percent after the company reported a 69 percent increase in second-quarter core profit and unveiled the Disney deal, part of its strategy to expand further in the United States. “It’s a 10-year alliance, and is a very important thing for us. It reflects on how the brand is perceived. Disney does not perform strategic alliances with just anyone, and we are very proud to be associated with Disney,” Leighton told Reuters. The Disney agreement gives Pandora access to its popular resorts and extends the company’s footprint in the United States - a core growth market for the company, according to analysts. Pandora’s second-quarter revenue was 2.5 billion Danish Crowns ($447.8 million) and the Americas led the way with 1.097 billion out of the total, followed by Europe on 1.064 billion. While revenue in Europe jumped 65 percent from a year earlier, it only increased five percent in the Americas. “Disney is definitely an opportunity to drive some more revenue in the U.S., and we are doing it to increase our sales,” Leighton said, adding he hoped to see the impact on next year’s revenue, without being able to elaborate on the range. One of Pandora’s main sellers in the United States has been its charms. The company will now work with Disney to produce a new range of charms, including beloved Disney figures such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, to go on sale in November. “The agreement with Disney is very interesting. It is a platform from which the Pandora brand could be spread and has the possibility of reaching a much younger client,” said analyst Soren Lontoft at Sydbank. “The United States is the largest single market for Pandora, and there are still a lot of opportunities to grow in this market,” he said. The company also announced it would buy 27 Pandora-branded stores from U.S. jeweller Hannoush, adding to the 369 concept stores it has in the Americas as a whole. Pandora raised its 2014 revenue outlook to more than 11 billion Danish crowns from 10.5 billion, although it kept its EBITDA margin target unchanged at 35 percent. At 1318 GMT Pandora shares were 7.5 percent higher. Core earnings (EBITDA) rose to 893 million Danish crowns in the second quarter, higher than an average forecast of 786 million Danish crowns in a Reuters poll. Leighton declined to comment on a lawsuit launched last month by 36 shareholders. They are seeking compensation because, they say, they lost money in 2011 because Pandora announced a profit warning too late. The warning sent Pandora’s shares down 65 percent in August 2011. Leighton, who was chairman at the time, was also sued. Pandora’s shares slumped after news of the investor lawsuit was made public at the end of July and Tuesday’s jump returns them to levels last seen on July 23.

770,DIS,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Denmark's Pandora shares jump after results, Disney deal","(Corrects story from Aug 12 to show the 27 concept stores purchased by Pandora were already included in the Americas count, paragraph 11) * CEO hopes to see positive results of Disney deal in 2015 * Pandora Q2 EBITDA rises 69 percent, exceeds expectations * Pandora keeps EBITDA margin, ups 2014 revenue forecasts By Annabella Nielsen COPENHAGEN, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Danish jewellery retailer Pandora hopes a new alliance with Walt Disney Company will boost sales as soon as next year, Pandora CEO Allan Leighton said after unveiling a jump in profits. Pandora’s shares rose more than nine percent after the company reported a 69 percent increase in second-quarter core profit and unveiled the Disney deal, part of its strategy to expand further in the United States. “It’s a 10-year alliance, and is a very important thing for us. It reflects on how the brand is perceived. Disney does not perform strategic alliances with just anyone, and we are very proud to be associated with Disney,” Leighton told Reuters. The Disney agreement gives Pandora access to its popular resorts and extends the company’s footprint in the United States - a core growth market for the company, according to analysts. Pandora’s second-quarter revenue was 2.5 billion Danish Crowns ($447.8 million) and the Americas led the way with 1.097 billion out of the total, followed by Europe on 1.064 billion. While revenue in Europe jumped 65 percent from a year earlier, it only increased five percent in the Americas. “Disney is definitely an opportunity to drive some more revenue in the U.S., and we are doing it to increase our sales,” Leighton said, adding he hoped to see the impact on next year’s revenue, without being able to elaborate on the range. One of Pandora’s main sellers in the United States has been its charms. The company will now work with Disney to produce a new range of charms, including beloved Disney figures such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, to go on sale in November. “The agreement with Disney is very interesting. It is a platform from which the Pandora brand could be spread and has the possibility of reaching a much younger client,” said analyst Soren Lontoft at Sydbank. “The United States is the largest single market for Pandora, and there are still a lot of opportunities to grow in this market,” he said. The company also announced it would buy 27 Pandora-branded stores, known as “concept stores”, from U.S. jeweller Hannoush. They are already included in Pandora’s 369 concept stores in the Americas. Pandora raised its 2014 revenue outlook to more than 11 billion Danish crowns from 10.5 billion, although it kept its EBITDA margin target unchanged at 35 percent. At 1318 GMT Pandora shares were 7.5 percent higher. Core earnings (EBITDA) rose to 893 million Danish crowns in the second quarter, higher than an average forecast of 786 million Danish crowns in a Reuters poll. Leighton declined to comment on a lawsuit launched last month by 36 shareholders. They are seeking compensation because, they say, they lost money in 2011 because Pandora announced a profit warning too late. The warning sent Pandora’s shares down 65 percent in August 2011. Leighton, who was chairman at the time, was also sued. Pandora’s shares slumped after news of the investor lawsuit was made public at the end of July and Tuesday’s jump returns them to levels last seen on July 23.

772,DIS,"Disney brings the Force with 'Star Wars' game, TV show push","LOS ANGELES, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is ramping up its first major push to promote the “Star Wars” franchise it purchased from George Lucas in 2012, blitzing consumers this year with a mobile game, animated TV show and an expanded line of toys and clothes. The anticipated rush of light sabers, Wookiees and other “Star Wars” mainstays is Disney’s attempt to cash in on its $4.05 billion acquisition of LucasFilm, which gave the company a popular yet aging franchise that has not produced a new feature film in nine years. On Thursday the company introduced “Star Wars: Commander,” a free mobile app that lets players direct battles with franchise heroes Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia. It is available exclusively for 30 days through Apple Inc’s  App Store and later on Google Inc’s Android devices. Disney generates revenue by selling a currency known as crystals that can be used to speed up game play. On Sept. 29, the company will release computer-animated movie “Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion” online and on the Watch Disney XD app. The film debuts on Disney Channels around the world on Oct. 3, followed by a series based on the movie on the Disney XD channel starting Oct. 13. This week, retailers began selling toys, bedding, backpacks and other products tied to the series, expanding the range of “Star Wars” items previously available. A line of “Star Wars”-branded healthy foods will hit shelves next year. The game will be promoted on Disney’s StarWars.com website, which is drawing steady traffic from fans more than a year before the next film, “Episode VII,” hits theaters, said Jimmy Pitaro, president of Disney’s interactive unit. “We are still a decent amount of time from the movie, and yet we are seeing a huge amount of interest,” Pitaro said. It remains to be seen if “Star Wars” will be as much a draw as a couple decades ago. But the campaign is representative of Disney’s strategy of banking on acquired names. This year, retailers generated $1 billion in sales from each of eight Disney’s franchises, including Marvel’s Spider-Man and Pixar movie “Cars,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has said. The company says will release a film annually starting with  “Episode VII.” It also plans to “significantly” increase the space adventure’s presence at its theme parks, Iger said during an Aug. 5 earnings call. Although Iger didn’t disclose how the company intends to use “Star Wars” at its parks, in 2012 it tapped another franchise when it opened a 12-acre Cars Land, based on the 2006 Pixar film, at Disney California Adventure park in Anaheim. “This is one of those franchises you just can’t overexpose,” said Peter Sealey, former head of marketing at Columbia Pictures. “You just put the metal to the floor and enjoy the ride.”    (Reporting By Ronald Grover; Editing by Edwin Chan and Cynthia Osterman)",8212014,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-starwars/disney-brings-the-force-with-star-wars-game-tv-show-push-idUSL2N0QO1Z920140821
773,DIS,UPDATE 1-Emmys TV audience drops to 15.6 million with Monday switch,"(Adds details of show, reviews) By Piya Sinha-Roy LOS ANGELES, Aug 26 (Reuters) - After moving up a month and switching to a weekday evening, Monday’s Primetime Emmy awards drew 15.6 million viewers, a drop from last year’s Sunday night show despite a new host, a passionate kiss and a touching tribute. This year’s Emmy awards, which saw AMC’s drug drama “Breaking Bad” and ABC’s hit “Modern Family” take home the top awards in drama and comedy, drew the second-highest viewership in the past eight years, NBC said on Tuesday, citing Nielsen ratings figures. The show, which was also moved a month earlier to August, drew 5.3 million viewers in the 18-to-49 demographic coveted by advertisers. On social media, Emmys were a top trending topic on Twitter throughout the telecast, while 6.2 million people discussed the show on Facebook. Key moments from the night included “Veep” winner Julia Louis-Dreyfus locking lips with Bryan Cranston for a passionate kiss as a throwback to their “Seinfeld” days as she went up to collect her best comedy actress award, and an audience question-and-answer session with Melissa McCarthy asking whether her illegally parked car would get towed. The show also featured Billy Crystal’s touching and funny tribute to the late Robin Williams. Comcast Corp’s NBC said the Emmys telecast beat rival broadcast networks in the 8 p.m.-to-11 p.m. time period, with CBS Corp’s CBS, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s  FOX and Walt Disney Co’s ABC drawing a combined total of 13.8 million viewers on Monday. Last year’s show, which took place on a Sunday in September and was hosted by Neil Patrick Harris on CBS, drew 17.6 million viewers. Critics this year picked on the complicated awards show categories, which saw some confusing entries such as HBO’s “True Detective” in best drama rather than miniseries, and Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black” drama about a women’s prison submitted in the best comedy category. The controversy served first-time Emmy host Seth Meyers well in his opening monologue as he joked about trying to submitting his “Late Night” show as a miniseries, but critics were left torn by the night’s events. Alessandra Stanley at the New York Times said Meyers “was charming, but he didn’t take many risks, and overall, the ceremony was a brisk, rather tame event.” Tim Goodman at the Hollywood Reporter said the “head-scratching awards show” delivered winners “all over the map,” but praised Meyers for being “affable and steady and kept the banter light and upbeat.”   (Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Eric Kelsey and Jonathan Oatis)",8262014,http://www.reuters.com/article/television-emmys-ratings/update-1-emmys-tv-audience-drops-to-15-6-million-with-monday-switch-idUSL1N0QW1WI20140826

A&E;, which is jointly owned by Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and media group Hearst Corp, is investing $250 million in Vice Media, which started as a Canadian magazine and has ballooned into a multimedia conglomerate known for producing edgy videos and news reports. The deal was first reported by the Financial Times. Vice Media Chief Executive Officer Shane Smith told the FT that it is a great deal. “It means we can preserve our independence and it gives us a war chest for another three years of dramatic growth,” he said.

778,DIS,CORRECTED-U.S. fantasy sports startup FanDuel raises $70 million,"(Corrects to say that Shamrock Capital is the investment arm of Roy E. Disney’s family) * Funding round led by Shamrock Capital * Private equity firm KKR is new investor * FanDuel could look at IPO in next two or three years-CEO By Liana B. Baker NEW YORK, Sept 2 - FanDuel, a startup that runs real-money fantasy sports leagues, said Tuesday it has raised $70 million in a funding round led by Shamrock Capital that also includes private equity firm KKR and NBC Sports. The company creates one-day tournaments for fantasy sports and expects to pay out $400 million in prizes this year. The valuation of the company after this funding round was not disclosed and neither was the amount that each investor contributed. NBC Sports is a division of NBCUniversal, a unit of Comcast Corp. Investors have been looking for new ways to capitalize on the rising value of live sports. FanDuel’s latest move expands its previous total funding of $18 million by a wide margin. One of FanDuel’s rivals, DraftKings raised $41 million in a funding round in late August. FanDuel’s Chief Executive Officer Nigel Eccles said in an interview that the company turned profitable in the fourth quarter of last year. It generates revenue by keeping a cut of the entry fees fans pay to compete. Online fantasy sports that involves real money are not viewed by regulators as gambling since fantasy sports are considered to be games of skill that involve knowledge of professional athletes and statistics. Eccles said FanDuel will use the funds to invest more in the mobile version of the product and also increase spending on marketing. While some sources close to the deal told Reuters that FanDuel could one day be an acquisition target for a media company, Eccles said he would like the company to remain independent and he could see FanDuel pursuing an initial public offering. “We would look at an IPO in two or three years,” he said. While season-long fantasy sports have been around for years they are dominated by companies such as ESPN, CBS and Yahoo Sports. FanDuel, meanwhile, is focused on contests that last one day. These term contests have the potential to spur a fan-following for late-season games in various sports that have no playoff consequences. “The one day fantasy market has been very fast growing. It’s right on the cusp of becoming mainstream,” said Michael Lasalle, a partner at Shamrock who will join FanDuel’s board. Shamrock Capital, which sold the Harlem Globetrotters last year, is the private equity firm that started as the investment arm of the family of Roy E. Disney, the son of Walt Disney’s brother Roy. Previous investors in FanDuel that also participated in the round are Comcast’s venture capital arm, Comcast Ventures, Pentech Ventures, Bullpen Capital, Scottish Enterprise and Richard Koch. Eccles said he was pleased that he can count large private equity firm KKR as a new backer for the company he co-founded. “Typically KKR focuses on much bigger companies but they approached us and we met them and liked the team. It’s always good to have a very deep-pocketed investor supporting the company,” he said.

779,DIS,Disney opposes dance music star's iconic mouse head trademark,"(Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co, creator of Mickey Mouse, is asking the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to refuse a trademark by electronic music star Deadmau5, who wears a LED-light powered, big-eared mouse helmet during concerts.  Deadmau5, pronounced “dead mouse,” is the stage name for Joel Zimmerman, a Canadian disc jockey who has been nominated for and performed at the Grammy Awards.  Zimmerman filed an application in 2013 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register his wide-smiling mouse symbol. In an opposition filing on Tuesday, Disney said the company would be damaged if he succeeds. “Lawyer up, Mickey,” Zimmerman, 33, told his 3 million Twitter followers. “Disney thinks you might confuse an established electronic musician/performer with a cartoon mouse. That’s how stupid they think you are.”  Disney representatives did not respond to a request for comment.  In 2010 Zimmerman trademarked a different mouse head symbol, with the face at a slight angle, and earlier this month applied for a trademark over yet another, this one with X’s over the eyes.  In its opposition this week, Disney presented the trademark office with a side-by-side comparison with its own three-circle mouse ears logo, saying Zimmerman’s was likely to cause confusion and damage its brand.  Disney emphasized the popularity of Mickey, whose image it has used in films, music and cartoons and on clothing since 1928.  “Mickey Mouse is recognized as among the greatest animated characters of all time,” the company said. Zimmerman’s lawyer Dina LaPolt said in a statement: “Our client will not be bullied by Disney and is prepared to fight to protect his rights to his property.”  She added in an emailed statement, “(W)e wonder why Disney is only now coming after deadmau5,” given the Deadmau5 symbol had been registered in 30 countries and had been used for a decade.

781,DIS,'Spirit' fades for famed Japan animation studio after Miyazaki signs off,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The artistic legacy of Hayao Miyazaki, the reclusive and bearded Academy Award-winning director and animator sometimes called Japan’s Walt Disney, has never been more certain.  Yet at the same time, the commercial future for Studio Ghibli, the privately held Tokyo studio he left behind in retirement, has never been more in doubt. Under Miyazaki, Ghibli became famous for intricate, hand-drawn animation and imaginative coming-of-age story lines that made films like 1988’s “My Neighbor Totoro” into an international hit. A dozen years later, he masterminded what remains today as Japan’s highest grossing film, the Academy Award-winning “Spirited Away”. In recognition, Hollywood is about to add its ultimate honor by giving Miyazaki, 73, a lifetime achievement Academy Award. But the animation studio is finding that life after Miyazaki, who retired last year, is tough going.  Ghibli’s first release since the legendary animator’s departure, “When Marnie Was There”, has failed to catch fire with Japanese moviegoers over the summer. Besides the gaping hole left by Miyazaki, Ghibli, like Japanese companies in other industries, faces a range of challenges: high payroll costs, low productivity and the rise of new and cheaper hubs for production elsewhere in Asia. In six weeks, “Marnie,” the story of an asthmatic high school girl sent off for what becomes a summer marked by an unexpected and mysterious friendship, has taken in just $28 million at Japanese theaters. The mediocre takings comes as Ghibli’s fans and critics debate how and whether the studio will survive without the commercial magic of its founder. Senior producer Toshio Suzuki made waves last month when he said in a series of interviews that Studio Ghibli might have to dismantle the expensive production system set up under Miyazaki, which included employing full-time animators in Japan. “We’re going to spring clean and restructure,” Suzuki, 66, said in an interview with TBS broadcasting.  Suzuki said the studio would take a break and could re-launch with a different and lower-cost business model that could shift production from Japan to Southeast Asia or Taiwan. “Ideas will be formed in Japan and the animation could be made in another country,” he said. “It will be ‘Made in Asia’.” Ghibli declined to make Suzuki or Miyazaki available for comment. A studio spokeswoman, who declined to be named, said the privately held company, had no further comment on its plans. Famous for starting production without a complete script, Miyazaki insisted on working in pencil and spurned computer animation, resulting in intricately drawn frames and very long production spans. Some feature animations consist of about 10,000 drawings, but Ghibli’s sometimes exceed 80,000. In fact, Ghibli, under Miyazaki, made a virtue of its high-cost approach, doing everything - and working deliberately - from an ivy-covered, three-storey building in Tokyo’s western suburbs.  Ryusuke Hikawa, an expert on Japanese animation, estimates Ghibli was averaging just five minutes of animation production a month, given its recent pace of producing a feature every two years. That was sustainable when the studio, with Miyazaki at the helm, was turning out consistent hits. The nine Ghibli films that he directed averaged a box office take of $115 million.  “Spirited Away,” which came out in 2001 and won the Academy Away for best animated feature, remains Japan’s highest grossing film, taking nearly $300 million at the box office - ahead of both “Titanic” and Disney’s “Frozen”. Box office takings are particularly important for Ghibli because the company has limited spin-off merchandising, another break from the approach of Hollywood studios which long ago abandoned hand-drawn animation for computers. In June, Suzuki, 66, told a podcast for fans he had cautioned staff to keep merchandising sales below $100 million to sharpen the focus on movie-making. In part, as a result, Ghibli has had a volatile earnings record, according to credit rating agency Tokyo Shoko Research, which audited the studio’s books. In the fiscal year that ended March 2012, it earned $9 million. That dropped to $5 million in 2013 and then jumped to $30 million in the just-ended fiscal year, reflecting the success of Miyazaki’s last film, “The Wind Rises”. Fans are focusing on “Marnie” because it is the first Ghibli film shaped entirely without the involvement of Miyazaki, Suzuki or the other famed Ghibli director, Isao Takahata.  Yuichi Maeda, a movie critic, said the film’s director, 41-year-old Hiromasa Yonebayashi, had delivered brilliantly drawn animation, but without the energy of a Miyazaki film. The studio said overseas distribution plans have yet to be decided. Maeda said he did not believe Ghibli could prosper without Miyazaki’s guiding hand. “Ghibli’s popularity, unlike Pixar or Disney, depends on who directs its movies,” he said. “I don’t think Ghibli without Miyazaki can succeed.”   ",9072014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-film-japan-ghibli/spirit-fades-for-famed-japan-animation-studio-after-miyazaki-signs-off-idUSKBN0H20UL20140907

Senior producer Toshio Suzuki made waves last month when he said in a series of interviews that Studio Ghibli might have to dismantle the expensive production system set up under Miyazaki, which included employing full-time animators in Japan. “We’re going to spring clean and restructure,” Suzuki, 66, said in an interview with TBS broadcasting. Suzuki said the studio would take a break and could re-launch with a different and lower-cost business model that could shift production from Japan to Southeast Asia or Taiwan. “Ideas will be formed in Japan and the animation could be made in another country,” he said. “It will be ‘Made in Asia’.” Ghibli declined to make Suzuki or Miyazaki available for comment. A studio spokeswoman, who declined to be named, said the privately held company, had no further comment on its plans. QUALITY - AT A PRICE Famous for starting production without a complete script, Miyazaki insisted on working in pencil and spurned computer animation, resulting in intricately drawn frames and very long production spans. Some feature animations consist of about 10,000 drawings, but Ghibli’s sometimes exceed 80,000. In fact, Ghibli, under Miyazaki, made a virtue of its high-cost approach, doing everything - and working deliberately - from an ivy-covered, three-storey building in Tokyo’s western suburbs. Ryusuke Hikawa, an expert on Japanese animation, estimates Ghibli was averaging just five minutes of animation production a month, given its recent pace of producing a feature every two years. That was sustainable when the studio, with Miyazaki at the helm, was turning out consistent hits. The nine Ghibli films that he directed averaged a box office take of $115 million. “Spirited Away,” which came out in 2001 and won the Academy Away for best animated feature, remains Japan’s highest grossing film, taking nearly $300 million at the box office - ahead of both “Titanic” and Disney’s “Frozen”. Box office takings are particularly important for Ghibli because the company has limited spin-off merchandising, another break from the approach of Hollywood studios which long ago abandoned hand-drawn animation for computers. In June, Suzuki, 66, told a podcast for fans he had cautioned staff to keep merchandising sales below $100 million to sharpen the focus on movie-making. In part, as a result, Ghibli has had a volatile earnings record, according to credit rating agency Tokyo Shoko Research, which audited the studio’s books. In the fiscal year that ended March 2012, it earned $9 million. That dropped to $5 million in 2013 and then jumped to $30 million in the just-ended fiscal year, reflecting the success of Miyazaki’s last film, “The Wind Rises”. Fans are focusing on “Marnie” because it is the first Ghibli film shaped entirely without the involvement of Miyazaki, Suzuki or the other famed Ghibli director, Isao Takahata. Yuichi Maeda, a movie critic, said the film’s director, 41-year-old Hiromasa Yonebayashi, had delivered brilliantly drawn animation, but without the energy of a Miyazaki film. The studio said overseas distribution plans have yet to be decided. Maeda said he did not believe Ghibli could prosper without Miyazaki’s guiding hand. “Ghibli’s popularity, unlike Pixar or Disney, depends on who directs its movies,” he said. “I don’t think Ghibli without Miyazaki can succeed.”    (1 US dollar = 104.8100 Japanese yen)   (Editing by Kevin Krolicki, Elaine Lies and Jeremy Laurence)",9072014,http://www.reuters.com/article/film-japan-ghibli/spirit-fades-for-famed-japan-animation-studio-after-miyazaki-signs-off-idUSL3N0R32T020140907
783,DIS,"Lawsuit says Disney, Sony, others conspired to suppress wages","(Reuters) - A federal lawsuit filed on Monday accuses Walt Disney Co, Sony Pictures and other leaders in special effects and animation of conspiring to suppress wages in the industry through “no-raid” agreements. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose, California, also names DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc, Digital Domain 3.0 and ImageMovers LLC as defendants. The proposed class action alleges that the defendants agreed not to poach employees from one another, artificially depressing wages. Disney had already reached a $9 million settlement with  salaried employees in July 2013 as part of a broader class action lawsuit over no-raid agreements in the California technology industry. The proposed class in the new lawsuit consists of “technical, artistic, creative and/or research and development” employees and is not restricted to salaried employees.  The lawsuit alleges that the conspiracy in the animation industry dates back to 1986, when Lucasfilm Ltd and Pixar, now both part of Disney, agreed not to cold call each other’s employees and not to outbid each other’s pay offers, according to the complaint. Other defendants entered into similar agreements with one another by the mid-2000s or even earlier, according to the complaint. The lawsuit points to numerous emails from company executives referring to no-raid agreements. In one 2007 email, Pixar president Ed Catmull is quoted as saying that poaching each others’ employees with higher pay offers “seriously messes up the pay structure.” In another email, Catmull is quoted as saying that the animation companies had “avoided wars” because they had “conscientiously avoided raiding each other.” Catmull acted as an enforcer, according to the complaint, urging other companies to stick to the no-raid rule even when they weren’t directly threatening Pixar. In addition to the no-raid agreements, the lawsuit alleges that the companies’ senior human resources and recruiting personnel met yearly to compare employee pay. A Disney spokesman said the suit was without merit and the company would defend it vigorously. A DreamWorks spokeswoman declined to comment. The new lawsuit comes about a month after U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose refused to approve a proposed $324.5 million settlement in the broader tech industry suit, partly because she found recovery for the class members would be too low compared with the Disney settlement approved earlier. Defendants in that case, including Google Inc and Apple Inc, are appealing her ruling. The case is Nitsch v.

786,DIS,RPT-'Spirit' fades for famed Japan animation studio after Miyazaki signs off,"(Repeats to include link to graphic, no changes to text) By Megumi Lim TOKYO, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The artistic legacy of Hayao Miyazaki, the reclusive and bearded Academy Award-winning director and animator sometimes called Japan’s Walt Disney, has never been more certain. Yet at the same time, the commercial future for Studio Ghibli, the privately held Tokyo studio he left behind in retirement, has never been more in doubt. Under Miyazaki, Ghibli became famous for intricate, hand-drawn animation and imaginative coming-of-age story lines that made films like 1988’s “My Neighbor Totoro” into an international hit. A dozen years later, he masterminded what remains today as Japan’s highest grossing film, the Academy Award-winning “Spirited Away”. In recognition, Hollywood is about to add its ultimate honor by giving Miyazaki, 73, a lifetime achievement Academy Award. But the animation studio is finding that life after Miyazaki, who retired last year, is tough going. Ghibli’s first release since the legendary animator’s departure, “When Marnie Was There”, has failed to catch fire with Japanese moviegoers over the summer. Besides the gaping hole left by Miyazaki, Ghibli, like Japanese companies in other industries, faces a range of challenges: high payroll costs, low productivity and the rise of new and cheaper hubs for production elsewhere in Asia. In six weeks, “Marnie,” the story of an asthmatic high school girl sent off for what becomes a summer marked by an unexpected and mysterious friendship, has taken in just $28 million at Japanese theatres. The mediocre takings comes as Ghibli’s fans and critics debate how and whether the studio will survive without the commercial magic of its founder.

787,DIS,Jury selection begins in trial of Florida 'race war' planner,"ORLANDO Fla. (Reuters) - Jury selection is set to begin on Tuesday in the Florida trial of an alleged ringleader of a white supremacist group that was broken up in 2012 while training near Orlando and Disney World for a “race war”. Marcus Faella, 41, is charged with paramilitary training and shooting into a structure in Osceola County.  Prosecutors said Faella is a member of the American Front, a nationwide, military-style, skinhead organization, which is modeled on Britain’s far right, whites-only National Front. Faella was arrested in 2012 after an informant infiltrated his heavily fortified center for the AF on his isolated property in St. Cloud, about 11 miles from the Walt Disney World theme parks, according to an arrest affidavit. It said Faella had been “planning and preparing the AF for what he believes to be an inevitable race war” and had stated “his intent ... to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities”. The St. Cloud compound was shut down and 10 people arrested after the informant came to believe his life was in danger, the affidavit said. Prosecutors have since dropped most of the charges. Faella’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

792,DIS,"Florida orange industry mascot, Captain Citrus, gets makeover","ORLANDO, Fla., Sept 16 (Reuters) - Florida has a muscular new superhero, courtesy of Marvel Comics - Captain Citrus - a made-to-order crime fighter who promotes orange juice while battling evil through the power of the sun. “Maybe it’s my solar pods - maybe it’s my connection to these groves - or maybe you just really ticked me off. Either way, you’re going down!” warns Captain Citrus in the first digital edition of his adventures. The Florida Department of Citrus paid Marvel $1 million for the character and storyline as well as a marketing campaign that includes distributing a million free print copies of the comic book to elementary school students across the country, according to Citrus Department spokesman David Steele. The comic books come with lesson plans to teach children how to make smart nutritional choices, and feature orange juice as part of a healthy diet. The Marvel version of Captain Citrus is a square-jawed man with green hair and a skin-tight, orange-peel-colored suit, a full redesign of the Florida citrus industry’s original 2011 version, which was a round orange character with legs, arms and a green cape. The updated character will also interact with the popular Avengers Assemble team of superheroes, and have its print edition debut in October at New York Comic Con, an industry trade show. The debut comic book introduces readers to John Polk, a.k.a Captain Citrus, who is empowered by mysterious solar pods in the grove where he grew up. Captain Citrus joins the Avengers to battle bad guys in Orlando. Marvel, owned by the Walt Disney Co, was an obvious choice for a marketing campaign given the target audience of fourth- and fifth-grade students, Steele said. “They are the best in the world at what they do: developing dynamic characters, compelling storylines, cultivating lifelong relationships with fans and leveraging that good will to build brand loyalty,” Steele said of Marvel. Orange juice sales have been hurt by citrus greening, a bacterial infection ravaging Florida groves that has reduced orange production to its lowest level in 50 years. Sales also have been hurt by campaigns to cut consumption of sugary drinks, including 100 percent juice that is naturally sweet, Steele said.

793,DIS,"FEATURE-Movies bust out of screen with panoramic, virtual technology","LOS ANGELES, Sept 23 (Reuters) - A Tyrannosaurus rex lumbers forward, belts out a deafening roar, then stomps overhead, and a viewer watching inside a virtual reality headset turns around to see the beast walking away. The lifelike run-in with a prehistoric monster comes courtesy of prototype Oculus Rift goggles, giving a glimpse of  a future that breaks movies out of the flat screen. Virtual reality, which immerses viewers in 360-degree worlds long used in video games, is drawing top Hollywood filmmakers and studios such as Twenty-First Century Fox and Walt Disney Co. The technology should arrive on the consumer mass market within two years. Virtual reality can transport audiences into the middle of the movie landscape, says Brendan Iribe, chief executive of Oculus, which Facebook Inc acquired this year for $2 billion. “In some decade or two, we are going to be at a point where watching things on 2D surfaces is going to feel pretty outdated,” Iribe told Reuters. Virtual reality still has technological hurdles to overcome. The biggest problem is motion sickness in some users, which Oculus believes it is close to resolving. Hollywood directors are trying to figure out how to create 360-degree scenes, and it remains unclear if audiences will want to spend two hours in a virtual world, or just visit for shorter experiences. Iribe has big ambitions for Oculus Rift devices, the latest version unveiled at a developers conference on Saturday in Hollywood. A prototype is sold now to developers for $350 per headset. With a consumer version on the horizon, Iribe believes virtual reality devices could be in the hands of millions of consumers within a couple of years. Designers at Disney’s Lucasfilm are playing around on the desert planet Tatooine, exploring how to bring virtual reality to the “Star Wars” universe as the studio prepares to release Episode VII of the film franchise in 2015. “Lucasfilm absolutely thinks this is a phenomenal space to be in,” said John Gaeta, Lucasfilm’s Oscar-winning creative director of new media and experiences. To take smaller steps toward bigger screens, digital projection company Barco is introducing Barco Escape, a 270-degree panoramic screen, in movie theaters. The three-piece screen expands to the left and right of the theater walls. Fox is currently testing Barco Escape in select Cinemark theaters with young adult thriller “The Maze Runner”,  where scenes were extended onto the expanded screens using computer-generated digital imagery. “Maze Runner” director Wes Ball said the extended screens were intended to immerse viewers in the visually expanded world of the film, without detracting from the central screen. The bigger screens will attract younger audiences, especially those used to the bigger screens in video games, said Barco’s “cinemavangelist” Ted Schilowitz. He is also Fox’s resident “Futurist,” developing projects in a virtual reality bunker on the studio’s Los Angeles lot. Disney’s Pixar Animation Studios is also testing Barco Escape. Schilowitz calls Barco Escape the “bricks and mortar version” of virtual reality and films adapted to the 270-degree screen format can work on Oculus Rift. “This is the average consumer’s entry point to what a more immersive experience feels like,” he said. Oscar-nominated filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro, an early adopter of new technology in film, presented an Oculus Rift game based on 2013’s “Pacific Rim” at San Diego’s Comic-Con in July. But Del Toro told Reuters “it will be hard to direct (a movie) because you have to show the audience what to see” when viewers can look anywhere. But Robert Stromberg is undeterred. The Oscar-winning production designer of 2009’s “Avatar” and director of Disney blockbuster “Maleficent” now splits his time between traditional filmmaking and virtual reality storytelling, developing content for Oculus devices. “I’m really trying to see how the two can marry together,” he said. “I love the pioneering aspects. There is a thrill and an excitement to going in those places nobody has gone before.”   (Editing by Mary Milliken and David Gregorio)",9232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/film-virtualreality/feature-movies-bust-out-of-screen-with-panoramic-virtual-technology-idUSL2N0RN0B220140923

796,DIS,Disney extends CEO Iger's contract through June 2018,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s board extended Chairman and Chief Executive Bob Iger’s contract through June 2018, keeping him at the helm of the media and theme park company two years longer than he previously planned.  Disney announced the contract extension on Thursday but did not say who would succeed Iger, who has led the company to record profits. He plans to name a chief operating officer next year, a person with knowledge of Iger’s thinking said, setting up a likely successor. Tom Staggs, head of the company’s theme parks division, and Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo are considered leading candidates to replace Iger, Wall Street analysts say. The media company has thrived since Iger became CEO in 2005.  He oversaw the acquisitions of movie studios Pixar, Marvel and LucasFilm, which will release a new “Star Wars” movie in December 2015. A theme park in Shanghai also is slated to open next year.  Disney’s board earlier this year asked Iger to extend his contract for two years. Iger said he accepted so he could continue working on the major initiatives he put in place. “I looked ahead and got very excited about a lot of what we have in store, in particular some of the new things like Shanghai Disneyland and Star Wars,” Iger said in an interview. “I wanted to stick around to be part of that, not just the opening but seeing those big projects through.” Disney’s market capitalization has climbed to $150 billion from $48.4 billion during Iger’s tenure as CEO, Orin Smith, the company’s lead independent director, said in a statement. Total shareholder return has been 311 percent, compared with 92 percent for the S&P; 500 during that time.  “Bob Iger is the architect of Disney’s current success, with a proven history of delivering record financial results for the company quarter after quarter and year after year,” Smith said. The contract extension is the second for Iger, who is 63. He had previously announced plans to step down as CEO in April 2015 but later agreed to stay in that role, along with the job of chairman, through June 2016. The terms of his compensation will remain the same, Disney said. Keeping Iger in place for a longer period gives Disney more time to groom the person who will succeed him, Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said. “Disney is really locked down on a pretty good path,” he said.

Iger said he accepted so he could continue working on the major initiatives he put in place. “I looked ahead and got very excited about a lot of what we have in store, in particular some of the new things like Shanghai Disneyland and Star Wars,” Iger said in an interview. “I wanted to stick around to be part of that, not just the opening but seeing those big projects through.” Disney’s market capitalization has climbed to $150 billion from $48.4 billion during Iger’s tenure as CEO, Orin Smith, the company’s lead independent director, said in a statement. Total shareholder return has been 311 percent, compared with 92 percent for the S&P; 500 during that time. “Bob Iger is the architect of Disney’s current success, with a proven history of delivering record financial results for the company quarter after quarter and year after year,” Smith said. The contract extension is the second for Iger, who is 63. He had previously announced plans to step down as CEO in April 2015 but later agreed to stay in that role, along with the job of chairman, through June 2016. The terms of his compensation will remain the same, Disney said. Keeping Iger in place for a longer period gives Disney more time to groom the person who will succeed him, Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said. “Disney is really locked down on a pretty good path,” he said.

800,DIS,NBA TV deal allows for ESPN Internet streaming channel,"(Reuters) - The NBA’s agreement on a new more than $20 billion multi-year contract with broadcast partners Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc was overshadowed by news that Disney’s ESPN is joining with the basketball league to create an Internet sports channel available without a pay TV subscription. A new streaming channel planned by ESPN, which sources familiar with the plans said would be widened to include other sports, is an early step that could upend the traditional cable and satellite companies if it leads more consumers cancelling their pay TV service.  Cable and satellite providers pay Disney and Time Warner richly for their sports-heavy content. ESPN executives insist they are committed to the current pay TV system, and that any programming sold directly to consumers will complement rather than compete with the content available through pay TV packages. But others said the streaming channel could have the same kind of transformative effect on sports programming that Netflix Inc has had on dramas and sitcoms.  “This is the first crack in the structure of the television business that has been in place for decades,” said Forrester analyst Jim Nail.  Under the new deal, ESPN will make a limited number of regular season NBA games available on the streaming channel, the sources said. The offerings will be expanded to include other sports, they said. The sources could not speak on the record because terms of the deal were not public. ESPN said in May that it was considering selling online access to live Major League Soccer games to consumers without pay TV subscriptions.  The network said in a statement on Monday it has a framework in place with the NBA for the streaming service, and that the league would have an equity interest in the product.  ESPN offered the equity interest to the NBA as an incentive for the league to choose the streaming service - rather than a new programming partner such as Fox - for certain games, the sources said. The games being made available are those not already being shown on television ESPN and Turner as part of the rights renewal package, they said.  Disney and Time Warner Inc’s Turner Broadcasting System will more than double their annual payments to the NBA under the new nine-year deal, people familiar with the matter said. Starting in the 2016-17 season, the two networks will pay more than $2.5 billion, an increase from $960 million per year in the past agreement. Over nine years, the deal could be worth upwards of $22.5 billion.  ESPN paid a bigger share than Turner because its deal includes international and radio rights, as well as WNBA games, according to people familiar with the matter.  The agreement comes just days after satellite provider DirecTV agreed to pay $1.5 billion a year to extend its exclusive contract to sell its “Sunday Ticket” package of National Football League games.  Both deals are a reminder of the unique allure of sports programming for broadcasters and cable networks, whose non-sports lineups have been losing viewers to streaming services like Netflix or are being watched on digital video recorders that allow users to skip commercials.      ABC and ESPN, both owned by Disney, will televise 100 regular-season games per year, and TNT, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting, will televise 64, the NBA said.  ESPN said it will increase its NBA-focused programming with 750 new hours of content.  The NBA’s current eight-year deals with ABC/ESPN and TNT expire at the end of the 2015-16 season. ESPN’s current deal covering NBA games on television began in 2002, when the network won the rights from NBC. TNT has been covering the NBA since 1988.

802,DIS,Walt Disney rescues Euro Disney with $1.3 billion funding deal,"LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has come to the rescue of its loss-making subsidiary Euro Disney EDLP.PA with a 1 billion-euro ($1.3  billion) funding deal announced on Monday, which could give the U.S. group total control over Europe’s biggest tourist attraction. The deal includes a rights issue and debt restructuring  which will inject 420 million euro in cash into the Euro Disney group and eliminate 600 million euros of its debt owed to Walt Disney via an equity swap. Euro Disney is currently 40 percent owned by Walt Disney and 10 percent by the Saudi prince AlWaleed bin Talal with the rights issue to raise 351 million euros open to all shareholders but backed by Walt Disney, which will be required to make a tender offer for the whole company.  Twenty miles east of Paris, the resort has struggled amid the economic downturn in Europe, with attendances down by 700,000 to 800,000 visitors at just over 14 million visitors in the last year. At the same time its total debt of 1.75 billion euros which is owed to Walt Disney has hampered its ability to invest in upgrades to the park. The company said it estimates that revenue for the year just ended on Sept. 30 fell by up to 3 percent to 1.27 billion euros while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) dipped to 110-120 million euros from 144 million and net losses rose to between 110-120 million euros from 78 million. “This proposal to recapitalize the Euro Disney Group is essential to improve our financial health and enable us to continue making investments in the resort that enhance the guest experience,” company president Tom Wolber said in a statement. Under the plan, shareholders are to be offered nine new shares for every one held for 1 euro a share, raising 351 million euros. The company said the rights offer price represented a 20 percent discount to Friday’s closing price, adjusted for the issuance of the new shares. In addition, shareholders will have the option to buy some of the shares issued in the debt conversion at 1.25 euros a share to avoid diluting their stakes. The company’s debt will fall to 998 million euros, taking the company’s balance sheet from a negative equity position of around 200 million euros at the end of September to positive equity of 800 million. Depending on shareholder uptake of the rights issue and debt swap, the company said there was a small chance that the listed entity could be removed from the stock market. Shares in Euro Disney were down 13.6 percent at 2.99 euros by 1045 GMT (0645 EDT) as investors digested the mooted changes.  “The objective of this operation is to strengthen Euro Disney, not to de-list it from the stock market,” Finance Director Mark Stead told Reuters. “Everything has been done to help convince shareholders to support the operation and subscribe to the capital increase so as to accompany Walt Disney in developing the company.” Stead said that the level of Walt Disney’s holding in Euro Disney after the capital increase and debt restructuring will be determined by how many other shareholders take up the share offers. AlWaleed bin Talal has not yet decided whether to subscribe to the share capital increase. “I spoke to the Prince this morning, he welcomed the transaction but he hasn’t yet taken a stand on which way he wants to go, he’ll be coming back to us in about a week’s time,” said Stead. Euro Disney had a market capitalization of 137 million euros at Friday’s close. After the share sale and debt restructuring, the market capitalization of Euro Disney will be roughly 980 million euros, said a company spokesman.

806,DIS,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Euro Disney agrees to funding deal backed by Walt Disney,"(Corrects details of rights issue in fifth paragraph, adding that main offer is worth 351 million euros) LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Euro Disney said on Monday it had agreed a 1 billion euro funding deal backed by its largest shareholder, the Walt Disney Co, which includes a share sale and a debt restructuring, to allow it to invest in the business. Euro Disney, the entertainment resort based in an eastern suburb of Paris, is 40 percent owned by parent Walt Disney  and 10 percent by the Saudi prince AlWaleed bin Talal. As part of the offer Walt Disney would be required to launch a tender offer on Euro Disney shares. Depending on how many people subscribe to the capital hike, the company said there was a very small chance that the listed entity be removed from the stock market. Euro Disney has struggled during the economic downturn and said on Monday that it believed a new financing package would allow it to invest in the business and boost visitor numbers. The company said the plan will see Euro Disney receive a 420 million euro cash infusion, which will include a 351 million-euro rights issue open to all shareholders and backed by Walt Disney. The move would improve the cash position of Euro Disney by about 250 million euros. In addition, about 600 million euros of the group’s debt owed to Walt Disney will be converted into equity, while credit lines extended to Euro Disney by its parent will also be consolidated. Euro Disney is the single biggest tourist attraction in Europe with more than 275 million visitors since it opened in 1992. But the company has also struggled with on-and-off losses and now has 1.75 billion euros of debt. “Disneyland Paris is Europe’s number one tourist destination, but the ongoing economic challenges in Europe and our debt burden have significantly decreased operating revenues and liquidity,” said Tom Wolber, president of Euro Disney. Euro Disney’s Finance Director Mark Stead told Reuters the size of its parent’s stake after the restructuring would be affected by how many other shareholders take up the offering. Stead said Saudi prince AlWaleed bin Talal, the company’s second-biggest shareholder, has not yet decided whether to subscribe to the capital increase. “I spoke to the Prince this morning, he welcomed the transaction but he hasn’t yet taken a stand on which way he wants to go, he’ll be coming back to us in about a week’s time,” said Stead.

814,DIS,Alexander takes family on 'Very Bad Day' in Disney comedy,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A rogue crocodile, a green baby, a puking Peter Pan and a punching kangaroo are troublesome yet comedic obstacles that befall the Cooper family on a “Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day” in Disney’s new live-action family comedy. “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day,” out in U.S. theaters on Friday, is expanded from the 1972 book of the same name about a perpetually unlucky pre-teen boy.  After a particularly bad day at school that includes setting the science lab on fire, Alexander, played by Australian newcomer Ed Oxenbould, makes a wish on his 12th birthday that his family could experience just one very bad day. And that’s when things start going wrong for the Coopers - mom Kelly (Jennifer Garner) must try to avert a publishing disaster involving Dick Van Dyke while dad Ben (Steve Carell) tries to juggle baby duties with a job interview. “I really thought about how relatable it all was, how it related to my life as a parent,” said Carell, who has two young children. “So much of it rang true, and when things didn’t ring true to us, we would speak up.” Eldest son Anthony (Dylan Minnette) destroys the family vehicle during his driving test and gets suspended before prom, while his aspiring thespian sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) gets the flu ahead of playing “Peter Pan” on stage. As the Coopers navigate the numerous hazards thrown their way, including fire, shrimp and some hunky Australian cowboys, they find themselves bonding. “(Alexander) realizes everyone goes through the bad days, he’s not alone, and when he has this bad day with his family, he really connects with them and they really understand him,” Oxenbould said. Walt Disney Co. has most recently delivered family fare in animated, fairytale and superhero genres, with hits including “Frozen,” “Maleficent” and “Guardians of the Galaxy.”  “Very Bad Day,” made for $28 million according to BoxOfficeMojo.com, sees the studio embracing live-action family friendly movies that it was known for making, with classics such as the “The Parent Trap” in 1961, 1976’s “Freaky Friday” and 1993’s “Cool Runnings.” It is projected by BoxOffice.com to open with $16.5 million at the box office. “It’s so fun that Disney is making movies for whole families, live-action films, for families again,” said Garner, who has three children with husband Ben Affleck. Director Miguel Arteta said he was inspired by 1980s movies such as John Hughes’s “Sixteen Candles” and “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” and wanted to infuse some nostalgia into “Very Bad Day.” “Family movies have mostly become animated movies, and they’re doing incredible work in that area, but I was excited that Disney wanted to go back to something they had done great in the sixties,” Arteta said.  “This is a movie where people will have fun, laugh a lot, but they also recognize the family and feel like that family is a little bit like their family.” ",10102014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-film-verybadday/alexander-takes-family-on-very-bad-day-in-disney-comedy-idUSKCN0HZ13V20141010
815,DIS,CEO Bewkes needs to show Time Warner better alone than with Murdoch,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ten years ago, Walt Disney Co, having fended off a hostile bid from Comcast, had to make a case why it was better off as an independent company. It succeeded. Disney’s shares have soared more than 250 percent since. Now, Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes faces a similar moment of reckoning after rejecting a bid for $85 a share from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox.  Bewkes and other top brass will be under pressure at a meeting with analysts and investors next Wednesday to show they can repeat Disney’s magic. “Disney pleaded the case to get its share price up on their own,” said David Miller, an analyst with Topeka Capital Markets. “We think that Mr. Bewkes will attempt to drive home the same concept,” he said, adding it remained to be seen if Bewkes would manage to replicate Disney’s sterling stock performance. Time Warner is trading at around $73 - more than twice its price since Bewkes took over as CEO in 2008, but still below Murdoch’s original $85 bid. Fox had considered boosting the offer to as high as $95 a share, people familiar with the matter said.  Rejection has had its price. Time Warner shares have dropped 15 percent since Aug. 5, when Fox walked away from its offer. Fox shares are up 5.7 percent over the same period. “It’s too simple to say that Bewkes has to get the stock price over $85,” said Gabelli & Co analyst Brett Harriss.  “He has to tell us why he said no to Fox. Time Warner has said nothing - only that at no price would it combine with Fox.” Gabelli, an asset management firm, holds shares in Time Warner. Harriss thought a combined Fox and Time Warner would benefit both companies.  Bewkes, who last stood in front of investors during a similar meeting four years ago, will lay out a long-term vision for the company’s Warner Bros movie studio, Turner Broadcasting cable networks and pay TV channel HBO. Those plans could include letting consumers buy HBO without a cable subscription, given the popularity of the HBO GO mobile app, some analysts have said.  Topeka’s Miller said that a new broadband-only product similar to Netflix could crack open new markets. Topeka estimates that there are approximately 9 million households in the United States with Internet access but no pay TV and roughly 66 million households with pay TV but no HBO. Indeed, Bewkes has slowly changed his tune about Netflix that he once derided as a “200-pound chimp.” He said Monday, at a conference hosted by Hollywood website The Wrap, that he wished he personally owned the streaming video service, given its market value of around $30 billion. There are other signs of Time Warner’s long-term plan that have emerged over the past weeks.  Turner Broadcasting and Disney’s ESPN more than doubled their annual payments to the NBA under a new nine-year deal worth more than $22 billion. Collectively, TBS and ESPN will pay more than $2.5 billion, starting in the 2016-17 season, to the basketball league. The networks coughed up more to keep the rights out of the hands of Fox - which started its own sports network - and those of other rivals. The pricey content deal comes as Turner, which also operates the 24-hour news channel CNN, attempts to crack down on costs. The company, which employs about 14,000 full-time staffers, is poised to slash 10 percent of its workforce. Focusing on internal operations is how Disney jolted it shares, noted Topeka’s Miller - a strategy likely to be embraced by Bewkes.

Penney cuts same-store sales forecast as Sept sales slow (Oct. 8),"(Corrects paragraph 8 to say “which carries an exclusive assortment of Disney merchandise” from “which is the only U.S. department store retailer carrying an exclusive assortment of Disney merchandise.” Adds link to corrected press release.) Oct 8 (Reuters) - Retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc cut its current-quarter same-store sales forecast, citing lower sales in September and a “difficult retail environment,” sending its shares down sharply. The department store chain said it expected low-single digit percentage growth in same-store sales in the third quarter ending October. The company had earlier forecast mid-single digit growth. (bit.ly/1o7QPgw) Analysts on average were expecting a 5.3 percent increase in same-store sales, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. J.C. Penney’s shares were down 11.8 percent at $8.10 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. At its analyst day in New York, J.C. Penney Chief Executive Myron Ullman outlined plans to generate incremental sales of $2 billion between 2015 and 2017, by revamping high traffic areas of its stores. These areas generally sell beauty products, jewelry and fashion accessories. The company reported revenue of $11.86 billion for the year ended February. J.C. Penney, which carries an exclusive assortment of Disney  merchandise, said it would open more than 100 additional Disney branded shops inside its stores by the 2015 back-to-school season. J.C. Penney has been trying to win back shoppers by revamping its household goods section and bringing back many of the no-frills clothes that were ditched in a failed attempt to go more upmarket during 2012. That attempt to attract more affluent customers alienated its core low to middle-income customers, leading to a 30 percent sales decline over two years. The retailer operates about 1,060 stores in the United States and also sells goods through its website, jcpenney.com. The company’s shares have fallen more than 60 percent in the past two years.

820,DIS,"FEATURE-Animated robots, trolls and the dead dig up new film fans","LOS ANGELES, Oct 22 (Reuters) - An oversized personal health-care robot assistant might seem out of place next to the princesses and furry animals that have won over legions of fans, young and old, in animated films. But for every young girl belting out “Frozen” princess anthem “Let It Go,” Walt Disney Co is betting there’s a nerd who will root for the geeks and robot fighting evil in “Big Hero 6.” Disney’s big film this year leads a field of offbeat animated movies featuring little green monsters and a Day of the Dead love triangle that could lure new audiences to animation, an increasingly vibrant segment of the movie industry, both creatively and economically. The Marvel comics-inspired “Big Hero 6,” in theaters on Nov. 7, is centered in a futuristic world of robotics and takes place in Sanfransokyo, which imagines San Francisco fused with Tokyo. “It coincides with nerd culture being popular in pop culture,” said Don Hall, who co-directed the film with Chris Williams, both self-described nerds. Princess tales and the animal world dominated animation until the late 1990s with movies such as “The Lion King” and “The Little Mermaid.” Since then, unconventional heroes and edgier humor have emerged to push animated fare beyond kids-only consumption. There’s the swamp-dwelling ogre “Shrek” from DreamWorks Animation SKG’s and the child-frightening goofball monsters from Pixar Animation’s “Monster’s Inc.” and Steve Carell’s charmingly awful villain in “Despicable Me” - all which have gone on to sequels. “Big Hero 6” is Disney’s first animated foray into the Marvel world, inspired by an obscure comic of the same name. The protagonist is scrawny teen robotics prodigy Hiro, who, after suffering a tragic loss, befriends inflatable waddling robot Baymax, designed to be a personal health-care assistant. Hiro and his university buddies use their scientific prowess to transform themselves and Baymax into superheroes to combat a Kabuki-masked villain. “(Animation) is attracting more and more talented people and they’re creating more sophisticated stories,” said Williams, adding that studios like Pixar have “really done a lot to remove any stigma that animation is just for kids and families.” Animated films in 2013 accounted for $1.7 billion of the $10.2 billion in ticket sales at U.S. and Canadian box offices, according to movie tracking company Rentrak. Disney’s “Frozen” alone has made $1.2 billion worldwide since its November 2013 release. With animation making more money than ever before at the global box office and technological advances allowing such films to be made faster, competition is heating up for distinctive content. “We know that we need to make a place for ourselves in the world and in the market, and we need to do something different,” said Anthony Stacchi, co-director of independent Laika studios’ “The Boxtrolls,” about grotesque green misunderstood creatures with caring hearts. Made for $60 million and distributed by Focus Features in September, “The Boxtrolls” has grossed $75 million worldwide. When making “The Book of Life” with Twenty-First Century Fox’s Twentieth Century Fox, the first major studio animated film rooted in Mexican culture, filmmaker Jorge Gutierrez wasn’t worried about how it would resonate with non-Hispanic audiences. “In order to be universal, you have to be specific,” he said, citing France’s “Amelie” and Brazil’s “City of God” movies as “being of their countries, but are so beloved over the world.” “The Book of Life,” which opened with $17 million in U.S. theaters last week, follows a love story centered on Mexico’s Day of the Dead festival that flits between the living and the underworld realms of the dead. Acclaimed director Guillermo del Toro, who produced “Book of Life,” said the film “breaks a lot of molds” that have been set in Hollywood’s animated fare. “The problem is that people think animation is a genre for kids,” Del Toro said. “I think American animation is all much more poor by not tackling other subjects.” While the movie is targeted to all audiences, Gutierrez did make “Book of Life” to represent the Hispanic community, a growing force in the movie industry, in film. “The Latino audience ... has exploded, and they are hungry to see themselves up on the screen,” he said. “They go to the movies more than anyone ever thought.”     (Editing by Mary Milliken and Alan Crosby)",10222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/film-animation/feature-animated-robots-trolls-and-the-dead-dig-up-new-film-fans-idUSL2N0SD01T20141022
821,DIS,'Big Hero 6' to the rescue at new-look Tokyo film festival,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Hello Kitty and Doraemon anime characters strutted their stuff on the red carpet on Thursday, as Disney’s “Big Hero 6” kicked off a new-look Tokyo film festival that taps into Japan’s love of animation. The 27th Tokyo International Film Festival, which runs from Oct. 23 to 31, will hold special events alongside the main festival, including a “cosplay summit” and a Japanese food fair aimed at promoting Japan’s cultural and content industries. “Big Hero 6”, Disney Animation’s next big feature after last year’s hit, “Frozen”, centers on the bond between 14-year-old Hiro Hamada and the inflatable robot Baymax, as they and their friends battle a Kabuki-masked villain who has stolen Hiro’s microbot technology. The 3D comedy-adventure, which screened out of competition, takes place in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo, a mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo, and Japanese viewers will easily recognize the influence of Tokyo life and landmarks in the film. “The film has such a strong Japanese influence. It really is a love letter to Japan,” Don Hall, co-director of “Big Hero 6,” told Reuters on the red carpet at Tokyo’s Roppongi Hills. “So to have it coincide with the Tokyo film festival, it’s probably the perfect place to debut it,” he said, explaining why the Tokyo festival was picked for the world premiere. “Big Hero 6” is only the second animated film to open the Tokyo festival, and is the first Walt Disney animation movie to do so. Other anime highlights are a section on the works of “Evangelion” animator Hideaki Anno, and “Super Mario” creator Shigeru Miyamoto will premiere in 3D his “PIKMIN Short Movies,” based on Nintendo’s Pikmin game characters.     Japan is keen to boost its cultural exports and tourism by promoting its entertainment, fashion and other creative content under the government’s “Cool Japan Initiative.” This year’s festival will host a “World Cosplay Summit” for fans who dress up as their favorite anime and manga characters, and leading Japanese chefs will work the kitchen in “Tokyo Cinema Cuisine” trucks. John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Disney Animation and Pixar, will hold a talk session on “Cool Japan”. Fifteen films will vie in the main competition section for the festival’s top Sakura prize. Five are world premieres, including the lone Japanese entry “Pale Moon.” Many others are making their Asian premieres after screening at Toronto and other festivals, including French-Belgian crime thriller “The Connection,” starring Jean Dujardin (“The Artist”), and drama “1001 Grams,” Norway’s Oscar submission for Best Foreign Language Film. “Guardians of the Galaxy” director James Gunn heads the competition jury. Reflecting the greater emphasis on anime and superheroes, costumed characters mingled with movie stars on the red carpet. “I managed to see some actors in person, but I also got to see Ultraman and anime like Doraemon, as there were a lot of them, so I was really surprised,” said 20-year-old Chinami Kaneko.

825,DIS,"UPDATE 1-Marvel expands with Dr. Strange, female Captain Marvel films","(Adds details and quotes throughout) By Piya Sinha-Roy LOS ANGELES, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The Marvel cinematic universe is expanding with new characters Doctor Strange, Black Panther and Captain Marvel, who will be the first female superhero to anchor her own Marvel film, the Walt Disney Co-owned studio said on Tuesday. Marvel’s new slate of eight superhero films announced at a fan event includes both sequels to its stream of box office hits and new franchises, with “Doctor Strange” kicking off the newcomers in 2016. Doctor Strange is a former neurosurgeon who loses the ability to perform surgery and turns to magic. Despite widespread reports that he would be played by British actor Benedict Cumberbatch, Marvel did not confirm casting. “We are excited to tap into what excites us the most, which is the supernatural,” Marvel studio president Kevin Feige said. “If (casting) were confirmed, we would have introduced him today. Every single actor of a certain age has been rumored to be Doctor Strange,” he added. Feige also said there is plenty of time to find an actress to play Captain Marvel, the alter-ego of a character named Carol Danvers, for the film that will be released in July 2018. While Marvel has female superheroes like Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson, this is the first time a woman will anchor a film in what is widely seen as an effort to bring more women and girls to the fanboy heavy Marvel universe. Feige said there are no plans for a stand-alone Black Widow film, but that Johansson’s character will continue to be featured prominently in the other Marvel films. Black Panther, the superhero alter-ego of T’Challa, will premiere in 2017 and will be played by “42” actor Chadwick Boseman, who will also appear in “Captain America: Civil War,” the third installment of the “Captain America” franchise starring Chris Evans. Boseman and Evans were joined by “Iron Man” Robert Downey Jr. at the event held where fans erupted in screams and cheers while the actors bantered on stage for a few minutes. Disney has had a succession of blockbuster hits from its recently acquired Marvel Studios, from Downey Jr’s “Iron Man,” Evans’ “Captain America” and Chris Hemsworth’s “Thor.” Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, who plays popular supervillain Loki, will return in “Thor: Ragnarok” in July 2017, and Feige said the film will set a new timeline of events that will be followed in future Marvel films, which are often interconnected. “Avengers: Infinity War,” the third installment of the ensemble superhero franchise, will be split into two parts, with part one released in May 2018 and part two in May 2019. With Disney Animation releasing its first Marvel-inspired movie “Big Hero 6” next week and “Ant-Man” and “Avengers: Age of Ultron” scheduled for next year, Marvel is pushing ahead with new characters and franchises. In addition to new solo superheroes, Marvel will unveil the ensemble cast of “Inhumans” in 2018 for its 20th film, with Feige saying he hopes it will lead to numerous spin-off franchises.

828,DIS,Disney's 'Big Hero 6' shapes superheroes from robotics and anime,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The newest Marvel superhero to reach the big screen does not have the rugged good looks of Iron Man, the muscular physique of Captain America or a cape and hammer like Thor. But that is not stopping Walt Disney Co’s Disney Animation from hoping that Baymax, the inflatable oversized waddling robot of upcoming film “Big Hero 6,” becomes the studio’s very own “Iron Man” and launches a new animated superhero world. The Disney Animation studio is coming off the smash Oscar-winning hit “Frozen,” a tale of two princesses that became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time with $1.3 billion in global ticket sales. Now it hopes to find success with Friday’s release of “Big Hero 6,” a film based on a little-known Marvel comic book of the same name.  “Iron Man” helped “turn the ship as far as people taking a chance into science fiction and fantasy,” said Don Hall, who co-directed “Big Hero 6” with Chris Williams.  Tapping into the growing technology scene and young innovators, Williams said he hoped audiences would connect with a new band of superheroes comprised of smart tech nerds who harness their scientific knowledge, led by teen prodigy Hiro.  And then there is Baymax, a childlike, huggable healthcare robot inspired by a vinyl robotic arm the directors saw at Carnegie Mellon’s research labs. “Young people form robotics teams these days,” said Williams. “There does feel like there’s a renewed or growing interest in the young engineering side.” “Big Hero 6” is expected to generate $53 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales over its opening weekend, according to Boxoffice.com. The film follows Hiro in the city of Sanfransokyo, a near-futuristic imagining of San Francisco melded with Tokyo.  From the floating wind turbines painted in the style of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki’s Studio Ghibli films and characters inspired by anime, to finding Baymax’s face in the two holes connected by a line in small Japanese bells, Japanese influences are woven into the Disney aesthetic.  To create Sanfransokyo, Disney Animation’s chief technology officer Andy Hendrickson devised software to map Tokyo-style buildings over the current layout of San Francisco.  As Hiro enters a competition to win a place at the local technology college at the behest of his older brother Tadashi, tragedy strikes and Tadashi is suddenly killed.  Tadashi’s prototype robot Baymax comforts Hiro and joins him and his college friends to become superheroes using their scientific knowledge. They band together to take down a Kabuki-masked villain trying to take over the city with microbots. Disney films haven’t shied away from dealing with death, such as the mother doe in “Bambi” or Simba’s father in “The Lion King.” Those films helped the directors introduce death as a catalyst for their superhero origin story. “It’s hard for us to talk about who Hiro is and Baymax is without talking about the brother who connects them,” Hall said.

829,DIS,Disney's 'Big Hero 6' shapes superheroes from robotics and anime,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The newest Marvel superhero to reach the big screen does not have the rugged good looks of Iron Man, the muscular physique of Captain America or a cape and hammer like Thor. But that is not stopping Walt Disney Co’s Disney Animation from hoping that Baymax, the inflatable oversized waddling robot of upcoming film “Big Hero 6,” becomes the studio’s very own “Iron Man” and launches a new animated superhero world. The Disney Animation studio is coming off the smash Oscar-winning hit “Frozen,” a tale of two princesses that became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time with $1.3 billion in global ticket sales. Now it hopes to find success with Friday’s release of “Big Hero 6,” a film based on a little-known Marvel comic book of the same name. “Iron Man” helped “turn the ship as far as people taking a chance into science fiction and fantasy,” said Don Hall, who co-directed “Big Hero 6” with Chris Williams. Tapping into the growing technology scene and young innovators, Williams said he hoped audiences would connect with a new band of superheroes comprised of smart tech nerds who harness their scientific knowledge, led by teen prodigy Hiro. And then there is Baymax, a childlike, huggable healthcare robot inspired by a vinyl robotic arm the directors saw at Carnegie Mellon’s research labs. “Young people form robotics teams these days,” said Williams. “There does feel like there’s a renewed or growing interest in the young engineering side.” “Big Hero 6” is expected to generate $53 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales over its opening weekend, according to Boxoffice.com.

832,DIS,"'Guardians', 'Maleficent' drive Disney's revenue higher","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) reported a better-than-expected 7 percent increase in quarterly revenue on Thursday, driven by hit movies “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Maleficent.” “Guardians,” which was released in July, and “Maleficent,” starring Angelina Jolie as a black-robed villain, helped drive almost 18 percent growth in Disney’s movie studio unit. Disney’s shares were off 1.8 percent at $90.35 in extended-trading, after closing at a record high of $92 on Thursday. “Guardians” features a machine-gun-toting raccoon amid a cast of misfit super heroes. “Maleficent” brings back one of Disney’s most popular character since she appeared as the wicked fairy in the 1959 animated feature “Sleeping Beauty”. The studio business also benefited from strong DVD sales of “Frozen,” a story about two royal sisters in an icy kingdom. Operating income at sports behemoth ESPN declined due to higher contract rates for high-end National Football League and Major League Baseball games, which helped drag down the company’s cable networks unit by 1 percent. The drop in operating income at cable networks likely drove Disney shares lower, said Gabelli & Company analyst Brett Harriss, who rates Disney a “hold.” “Cable networks were a little weak,” he said. Harriss said he expected ESPN would make up for the higher programing costs in future quarters through higher fees from affiliates.  Revenue in Disney’s Media Networks, home to Disney channels,  ESPN and ABC, rose 5.5 percent due to higher broadcasting revenue from shows such as “Shark Tank” and “America’s Funniest Home Videos.” Parks and resorts revenue rose 7 percent due to increased attendance and higher ticket prices for theme park admissions. Net income attributable to Walt Disney rose to $1.50 billion, or 86 cents per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, from $1.39 billion, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 89 cents per share, in line with analysts’ estimates. Revenue rose to $12.39 billion, marginally above the average analyst estimate of $12.37 billion. Disney’s slate of releases for the current quarter are “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day” released in October and “Into the Woods” to be released at Christmas. Up to Thursday’s close, the stock has gained about 20 percent this year.

836,DIS,US STOCKS-Wall St ends flat; healthcare off on new Obamacare challenge,"* October jobs growth short of forecast but Aug, Sept revised up * Disney falls after results, Salix plummets * Indexes: Dow up 0.1 percent, S&P; 500 flat, Nasdaq off 0.1 percent   (Updates to market close) By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed little changed on Friday, pressured by renewed uncertainty in healthcare stocks and by Disney shares, even as October payrolls data pointed to a resilient economy in the face of sluggish global growth. The S&P; 500 and Dow industrials closed at record highs and rose for a third consecutive week. Health insurers fell sharply after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to a key part of the Obamacare health law that, if successful, would limit the availability of federal health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans. “Any kind of change in how the healthcare law is interpreted is going to affect healthcare stocks, probably insurers first,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “Whenever the rules have potential to change everybody gets nervous.” UnitedHealth Group fell 2.7 percent to $93.61, ranking as the largest weight on the Dow industrials. Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare fell 6.5 percent to $47.85 while managed care facilities operator Humana Inc was down 6.6 percent to $130.58. Healthcare stocks had been pressured from the opening bell by Salix Pharmaceuticals, which closed down 34 percent at $91.47 in its biggest-ever daily drop. Salix on Thursday slashed its full-year forecast given swollen drug inventories, an issue that dissuaded Allergan from acquiring the drugmaker, people familiar with the matter said. On the flip side, employers added 214,000 jobs last month, below the 231,000 expected in a Reuters poll of economists, while gains in the previous two months were revised higher. The unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent, the lowest since July 2008, even as more people entered the labor force. “With data like this the Federal Reserve doesn’t feel compelled to come in and help, or squash a too-hot economy,” said Fort Pitt Capital’s Forrest. “No more Fed (asset) buying but also no rate hikes quite yet.” Walt Disney Co fell 2.2 percent to $90 a day after earnings met expectations. The stock had closed Thursday at $92, a record high. First Solar sank 10.8 percent to $50.29 as the biggest decliner on the S&P; 500 a day after the company said it would not spin off its solar power plants into a separate, publicly traded entity as some of its competitors have done. Energy shares on the S&P; 500 were the day’s strongest performers, rising 1 percent. The sector is down 1.4 percent so far this year. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.46 points, or 0.11 percent, to 17,573.93, the S&P; 500 gained 0.71 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,031.92 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 5.94 points, or 0.13 percent, to 4,632.53. For the week, the Dow rose 1.1 percent and the S&P; added 0.7 percent in their third straight weekly gain. The Nasdaq closed the week up 0.04 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,869 to 1,188, for a 1.57-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,370 issues fell and 1,321 advanced for a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The benchmark S&P; 500 index posted 52 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 101 new highs and 58 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges totaled about 6.5 billion shares, compared to the 7.24 billion average in the last five sessions.

837,DIS,'Big Hero 6' vanquishes 'Interstellar' to lead U.S. box office,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - “Big Hero 6,” Walt Disney Co’s animated superhero film featuring a flying robot, clocked $56.2 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales to lead the weekend box office, topping director Christopher Nolan’s space adventure, “Interstellar.” “Interstellar,” starring Matthew McConaughey, opened on Wednesday and recorded $50 million over the three days from Friday through Sunday, and $52.2 million over its five-day run.   If the final figures hold up, it would be only the fourth time in history that two new films had hit the $50 million mark on the same debut weekend, the last time being June 2013 with “Monsters University” and “World War Z,” box office tracking firm Rentrak said. “Gone Girl,” director David Fincher’s hit starring Ben Affleck as a husband suspected of murdering his wife, was third  with $6.1 million, according to estimates from Rentrak. It has taken in more than $145 million since opening on Oct. 3. Inspired by a Marvel comic of the same name, “Big Hero 6” is set in a fictional futuristic metropolis called Sanfransokyo, in which a 14-year-old computer whiz kid fashions a team of superheroes out of students from a university robotics lab. With the help of a waddling, 6-foot-tall (183-cm) personal healthcare robot called Baymax, the team defeats a masked villain who harnesses the power of microbots to wreck havoc on the city. Dave Hollis, Walt Disney Studios’ head of distribution, said the film got “a great response from kids, from parents and from non-parents,” adding “you need to transcend the family audience in order to a get a number like this.” With the film “delivering general audience segments ... we’re set up to do a great, long run,” Hollis added. “Interstellar,” co-starring Anne Hathaway, features a team of space travelers who move through a wormhole in search of a habitable planet after blight and dust storms render Earth unlivable. Made for $165 million, the film was financed by  Warner Brothers, Paramount and Legendary Pictures. The film’s $13.4 million from large-format IMAX screens set a record for a November opening, as well for the biggest percentage of the total take for a first-run release. Initially linked to director Steven Spielberg, Paramount turned the film over to Nolan after Spielberg struck a deal with Disney in 2009. British-born Nolan brought a huge following from sci-fi and comic book fans from his successes with the “Dark Knight” Batman films and “Inception.” “Audiences love original movies and concepts,” said Megan Colligan, president of worldwide marketing and distribution at distributor Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom Inc. “It’s become sort of an event movie, with people planning for it and buying their tickets in advance,” said Colligan.

840,DIS,Florida 'race war' planner sentenced to six months,"ORLANDO Fla. (Reuters) - A Florida man accused of training members of a white supremacist group for a “race war” at a heavily fortified compound near Orlando and Walt Disney World was sentenced on Monday to six months in jail, according to court records. Marcus Faella, 41, was convicted earlier this year on two counts of paramilitary training. Authorities in central Florida called him the ringleader of a group they broke up in 2012, saying at the time it intended to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities. He was a member of the American Front, prosecutors said, describing the group as a nationwide, military-style, skinhead organization modeled on Britain’s whites-only National Front. At his sentencing, Faella was given credit for 61 days he had already served in jail, court records show. He also will serve two years of community control, the Orlando Sentinel reported. A confidential informant infiltrated the neo-Nazi organization, leading to his arrest in 2012 at a fortified compound on his isolated property in St. Cloud, Florida. It was located 11 miles from the Disney theme parks. According to an arrest affidavit, Faella had been “planning and preparing the AF for what he believes to be an inevitable race war” and had stated “his intent ... to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities.” Ten others were arrested and the compound shuttered after the informant came to believe his life was in danger, the arrest affidavit said. Prosecutors have since dropped most of the charges. Following his conviction, Faella’s attorney said he would seek to have the conviction overturned, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

843,DIS,Hasbro board votes to exit DreamWorks merger talks - source,"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Merger talks between Hasbro Inc  and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc formally ended on Monday morning, when the toy company’s board voted to walk away, according to a person with knowledge of the board’s actions. Discussions had cooled after members of the board visited DreamWorks’ Glendale, California studio complex, and press reports surfaced about the talks last Wednesday. Hasbro’s enthusiasm for the deal also waned after executives at Walt Disney Co’s consumer product unit voiced concern about the possible arrangement, said another person familiar with knowledge of the situation. Disney and Hasbro had agreed on Sept. 24 for Hasbro to make dolls based on Disney’s Princess and “Frozen” properties. Both sources could not be identified because neither is authorized to speak publicly. The maker of the “Shrek” and “Madagascar” film series was seeking $3 billion, or $38 a share, although Hasbro never made a bid, the person with knowledge of the Hasbro board said. DreamWorks stock closed down 14 percent at $22.31 on the NASDAQ. Hasbro shares ended up 4.35 percent at $56.37 on the same exchange. Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner brought the idea of buying DreamWorks to the toymaker’s board, after working closely with DreamWorks’ Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg over several months on designing characters for the studio’s movie based on its “Trolls” toy. Hasbro board members one night last week had dinner with Katzenberg at the CEO’s newly-built Beverly Hills home, and spent the next day at the studio. The two companies signed a deal in 2013 for Hasbro to make toys inspired by DreamWorks’ upcoming “B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations” and “Trolls” movies. A Hasbro spokeswoman did not return emails. DreamWorks and Disney spokeswomen had no comment.

Merlin, the world’s second largest operator of visitor attractions behind Walt Disney, said the new theme park  will cost up to 172 million pounds ($269.8 million). It will invest around a third of the total, with the rest coming from a property company funded by local investors.   The site will open in 2017 in the northern town of Chuncheon, Gangwon Province and adds to the group’s growing portfolio of six Legoland parks around the world. Merlin, which listed on the London stock market in November last year, is aiming to expand its business in the Americas and Asia Pacific with new sites.  It currently generates more than 60 percent of its revenues from Britain and continental Europe but its ultimate goal is for an equal split between Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific.  The company said in July it was advanced talks to open more Legoland Parks overseas after a sales surge at its U.S. sites on the back of “The Lego Movie”  helped boost first half-profits.  Its shares added 1.2 percent to 371p by 0900 GMT (4 a.m. EST), compared with a flotation price of 315p.

847,DIS,Disney-Pixar to translate 'Finding Nemo' film into Navajo,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (Reuters) - Hollywood is paying a tribute of sorts to the largest American Indian-speaking population in the United States by translating the wildly popular children’s film “Finding Nemo” into Navajo.  Advocates of the tribal language say it is slowly dying out, and that the move by Disney-Pixar could help it find a new generation of speakers by reaching out directly to children.  Marilyn Reeves, an Albuquerque-area Navajo grandmother, said her two grandchildren already watch the 2003 movie about the loveable clownfish every day.  “I think translating it will give them a chance to catch on to Navajo faster because they can see how it is used,” she said. Reeves said her family occasionally speaks Navajo at home, in part because she can see that each generation uses it less  as children grow up and leave the reservation.  “This translation helps legitimize our language,” she said. The Navajo “Finding Nemo” will be released next spring and will be the second movie translated into the language, after “Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope” was translated in 2013.  “After dubbing Star Wars in Navajo and seeing the audience reaction, I knew we needed to do more for the kids,” Manuelito Wheeler, director of the Navajo Nation Museum, said in a statement. “This movie is a true classic and we will work hard to uphold the Disney and Pixar standard while giving our Navajo kids an engaging and imaginative way to learn their language,” Wheeler said. Navajo is a language that often employs a description of what the word does to relay its meaning. Therefore, a single English word can require several words in Navajo. Tribal member Anita Yazzie said she was amused by how much the dialogue was changed in last year’s Star Wars translation. “It made me laugh, hearing R2D2 speak Navajo,” Yazzie said. “Sometimes it made it hard to follow the movie.” The most famous exponents of the Navajo language were the 29 “code talkers” who developed an unbreakable cipher based on their language that helped Allied forces win World War Two. The Navajo are not the only American Indian tribe to have a feature film translated into their language. In the mid-1990s, Disney translated another animated classic, Bambi, into Arapaho. U.S. Census data shows there are 286,000 Navajo living off and on the sprawling reservation in Arizona and New Mexico.

854,DIS,Dish wants to keep broadcasters out of basic Web TV service -WSJ,"Dec 10 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp does not want to include broadcast channels in the basic package for its planned online TV service, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The second-largest U.S. satellite TV company’s plan to exclude broadcasters could become a sticking point in deals with major media companies, the Journal said. The video streaming service will allow customers to watch TV programs, sporting events and other content through a broadband connection. Dish’s move to relegate broadcasters such as ABC, CBS Corp  , NBC and Fox to a different tier could cost consumers more, the Journal reported. The internet TV service is likely to become a cheaper alternative to traditional cable and satellite services. The service, which is expected to launch soon, will cost about a dollar a day, or about $30 a month, the Journal added. Walt Disney Co has already signed a deal that gives Dish the option to place the ABC network on a separate tier, the Journal quoted people as saying. Englewood, Colorado-based Dish’s failure to convince other broadcasters to become a part of a separate tier within a certain time would result in ABC becoming a part of the basic Dish package, the Journal said. Earlier this month, Dish and CBS indicated there was a path to negotiate rights for streaming content, but did not elaborate further. Dish was not available for comment outside of regular business hours.    (Reporting By Tanvi Mehta in Bengaluru.

An unnamed spokesman of North Korea’s foreign ministry said there would be serious consequences if Washington refused to agree to the probe and continued to accuse Pyongyang, according to the North Korean U.N. mission and its official KCNA news agency. The United States stands by its assertion that North Korea was to blame, a White House National Security Council (NSC) spokesman said on Saturday, in response to the remarks. On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama blamed North Korea for the devastating cyberattack, which had led to the Hollywood studio cancelling the imminent release of “The Interview,” a comedy on the fictional assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In its first substantive response, the isolated North Korea said it could prove it had nothing to do with the hacking attack. “We propose to conduct a joint investigation with the U.S. in response to groundless slander being perpetrated by the U.S. by mobilizing public opinion,” the North Korean spokesman was cited as saying by KCNA. “If the U.S. refuses to accept our proposal for a joint investigation and continues to talk about some kind of response by dragging us into the case, it must remember there will be grave consequences,” the spokesman said. The North Korean spokesman was quoted as making similar remarks in a statement issued later by North Korea’s U.N. mission. NSC spokesman Mark Stroh dismissed this, saying: “We are confident the North Korean government is responsible for this destructive attack. We stand by this conclusion.” “The government of North Korea has a long history of denying responsibility for destructive and provocative actions,” he added. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it had determined that North Korea was behind the hacking of Sony, saying Pyongyang’s actions fell “outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior.” Obama said North Korea appeared to have acted alone. Washington began consultations with Japan, China, South Korea and Russia seeking their assistance in reining in North Korea. Japan and South Korea said they would cooperate. China, North Korea’s only major ally, has yet to respond, but a Beijing-run newspaper said “The Interview” was not a movie for Hollywood or U.S. society to be proud of. An Obama administration official said on Saturday: “In our cybersecurity discussions, both China and the United States have expressed the view that conducting destructive attacks in cyberspace is outside the norms of appropriate cyber behavior.” It was the first time the United States had directly accused another country of a cyberattack of such magnitude on American soil and set up a possible new confrontation between longtime foes Washington and Pyongyang. Obama said he wished that Sony had spoken to him first before yanking the movie, suggesting it could set a bad precedent. “I think they made a mistake,” he said. Sony Pictures Entertainment Chief Executive Michael Lynton insisted the company did not capitulate to hackers and said it was still looking for alternative platforms to release “The Interview.” This week, a spokeswoman for Sony had said the company did not have further release plans for the $44 million film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. Despite Obama’s stern warning to North Korea, his options for responding to the attack by the impoverished state appeared limited. The president declined to be specific about any actions under consideration. North Korea has been subject to U.S. sanctions for more than 50 years, but they have had little effect on its human rights policies or its development of nuclear weapons. It has become expert in hiding its often criminal money-raising activities, largely avoiding traditional banks. In a separate statement on Saturday in response to criticism of its rights record, North Korea vowed to boost its “nuclear power” to counter Washington’s hostile policy, saying it had become apparent the United States aimed to invade the North under the guise of human rights abuses. The FBI said technical analysis of malicious software used in the Sony attack found links to malware that “North Korean actors” had developed and found a “significant overlap” with “other malicious cyber activity” previously tied to Pyongyang. But it otherwise gave scant details on how it concluded that North Korea was behind the attack. U.S. experts say Obama’s options could include cyber retaliation, financial sanctions, criminal indictments against individuals implicated in the attack or even a boost in U.S. military support to South Korea, still technically at war with the North. But the effect of any response would be limited given North Korea’s isolation and the fact that it is already heavily sanctioned for its nuclear program. There is also the risk that an overly harsh U.S. response could provoke Pyongyang to escalate any cyber warfare. Non-conventional capabilities such as cyber warfare and nuclear technology are the weapons of choice for the impoverished North, defectors said in Seoul.

Obama said the cyberattack caused a lot of damage to Sony but the company should not have let itself be intimidated into halting the public release of “The Interview,” a lampoon portraying the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “We will respond,” Obama told an end-of-year news conference. “We’ll respond proportionally, and we’ll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose.” Earlier, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced it had determined that North Korea was behind the hacking of Sony, saying Pyongyang’s actions fell “outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior.” Obama said North Korea appeared to have acted alone.

It was the first time the United States had directly accused another country of a cyberattack of such magnitude on American soil and set up a possible new confrontation between longtime foes Washington and Pyongyang.

A North Korean diplomat at the United Nations in New York said Pyongyang had nothing to do with the cyberattack. “DPRK (North Korea) is not part of this,” the diplomat told Reuters. Obama said he wished that Sony had spoken to him first before yanking the movie, suggesting it could set a bad precedent. “I think they made a mistake,” he said. “We cannot have a society in which some dictator some place can start imposing censorship here in the United States,” he said. “Because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing when they see a documentary that they don’t like, or news reports that they don’t like.” Sony Pictures Entertainment Chief Executive Michael Lynton insisted the company did not capitulate to hackers and said it is still looking for alternative platforms to release “The Interview.” This week, a spokeswoman for Sony had said the company did not have further release plans for the $44 million film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. “We have not caved, we have not given in, we have persevered and we have not backed down,” Lynton told CNN. “We have always had every desire to have the American public see this movie.” Despite Obama’s stern warning to North Korea, his options for responding to the computer attack by the impoverished state appeared limited.

Washington began consultations with Japan, China, South Korea, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK seeking their assistance in reining in North Korea. Japan and South Korea said they would cooperate. China, North Korea’s only major ally, has yet to respond, but a Beijing-run newspaper said “The Interview” was not a movie for Hollywood or U.S. society to be proud of. An Obama administration official said on Saturday: “In our cybersecurity discussions, both China and the United States have expressed the view that conducting destructive attacks in cyberspace is outside the norms of appropriate cyber behavior.” Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott issued a statement on Sunday condemning the attack. “Cyberattacks such as these threaten a strong and prosperous economy and undermine our way of life,” he said. It was the first time the United States had directly accused another country of a cyberattack of such magnitude on American soil and set up a possible new confrontation between longtime foes Washington and Pyongyang. Obama said he wished that Sony had spoken to him first before yanking the movie, suggesting it could set a bad precedent. “I think they made a mistake,” he said. Sony Pictures Entertainment Chief Executive Michael Lynton insisted the company did not capitulate to hackers and said it was still looking for alternative platforms to release “The Interview.” Earlier, a spokeswoman for Sony had said the company did not have further release plans for the $44 million film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. Despite Obama’s stern warning to North Korea, his options for responding to the attack by the impoverished state appeared limited. The president declined to be specific about any actions under consideration. North Korea has been subject to U.S. sanctions for more than 50 years, but they have had little effect on its human rights policies or its development of nuclear weapons. It has become expert in hiding its often criminal money-raising activities, largely avoiding traditional banks. In a separate statement on Saturday in response to criticism of its rights record, North Korea vowed to boost its “nuclear power” to counter Washington’s hostile policy, saying it had become apparent the United States aimed to invade the North under the guise of human rights abuses. The FBI said technical analysis of malicious software used in the Sony attack found links to malware that “North Korean actors” had developed and found a “significant overlap” with “other malicious cyber activity” previously tied to Pyongyang. But it otherwise gave scant details on how it concluded that North Korea was behind the attack. U.S. experts say Obama’s options could include cyber retaliation, financial sanctions, criminal indictments against individuals implicated in the attack or even a boost in U.S. military support to South Korea, still technically at war with the North. But the effect of any response would be limited given North Korea’s isolation and the fact that it is already heavily sanctioned for its nuclear program. There is also the risk that an overly harsh U.S. response could provoke Pyongyang to escalate any cyber warfare. Non-conventional capabilities such as cyber warfare and nuclear technology are the weapons of choice for the impoverished North, defectors said in Seoul.

859,DIS,"College football's Rose, Sugar Bowls each top 28 mln TV viewers","LOS ANGELES, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The inaugural College Football Playoff drew more than 28 million television viewers to both semifinal games, sports network ESPN said on Friday, touting that number as the two largest cable television audiences ever. An average audience of 28.3 million watched Ohio State upset top-seed Alabama 42-35 in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on New Year’s day, according to Nielsen. Oregon’s 59-20 victory over defending champion Florida State earlier on Thursday in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, was watched by an average of 28.2 million viewers. Second-ranked Oregon will meet No. 4 Ohio State on Jan. 12 in Arlington, Texas, for the national championship. The four-team playoff has replaced the poll system that would determine which college teams would face each other for the championship. Last year’s Rose Bowl game drew 18.6 million and the Sugar Bowl drew 11.3 million. The highly profitable ESPN, a major revenue generator for owner Walt Disney Co, agreed in 2012 to pay more than $7 billion to broadcast college bowl games and the playoffs. The deal took effect in 2014 and runs for 12 years. Television networks reap some of their top advertising rates from sporting events because most sports viewers prefer to watch games live instead of recording them. Advertisers prefer viewers to watch programming live because they cannot fast-forward past commercials, as they can with programs they have recorded.

860,DIS,"FEATURE-Off to the races! Disney park runs mix fitness, fantasy","ANAHEIM, California, Jan 7 (Reuters) - At 5 a.m. on a Sunday, thousands of people stream down Disneyland Drive dressed in a mix of running gear, homemade costumes and face paint as Captain America, Thor or The Hulk. It’s the first Avengers Super Heroes Half Marathon, a 13.1-mile contest that is part of an expanding slate of sold-out races at Walt Disney’s theme parks in California and Florida. Runners come to Disney races for the chance to dash past Space Mountain or Cinderella Castle, grab high-fives from costumed characters, and show off their fandom. For Disney, which has become one of the nation’s biggest race organizers, the multi-day influx of runners, relatives and friends provides a chance to earn extra cash and help fill theme parks and hotels during slower weekends. “I love the atmosphere,” said Lauren Harrell, 27, after she finished the November super heroes race in a hand-painted T-shirt and foam headpiece as Groot, the human-like tree in Disney’s Marvel Studios film “Guardians of the Galaxy.” “People are cheering you every step of the way. And nobody judges you for dressing in costume,” said Harrell, who had a speaker attached to her waist so she could dance and sing to the “Guardians” soundtrack. What started with one race in 1994 has swelled to 190,000 people registering for the seven Disney race weekends from October 2013 to September 2014. Many races sell out within hours. This weekend’s Walt Disney World Marathon in Orlando, Florida, is the largest race weekend in the country, according to race director Jon Hughes. Starting Thursday, more than 53,000 runners will compete over four days in a marathon, half-marathon, 10K or 5K. Some will enter more than one race, and enthusiasts will finish all four, a 48.6-mile feat called the Dopey Challenge. Two more race weekends have been added to this year’s runDisney schedule, including a Star Wars Half Marathon at Disneyland in California, from Jan. 15 to 18. Other upcoming events include half marathons with Disney Princess or Tinker Bell themes. The races take place inside Disney resorts and on neighboring streets but outside of regular park hours. Related events include kids’ races, a Diaper Dash for crawlers, and a carb-loading Pasta in the Park party. Disney designs the races for first-time runners up to elite athletes, said Maribeth Bisienere, a senior vice president who oversees the runDisney business. Competitive runners can use their Disney marathon results to qualify for the Boston Marathon. Contestants there for fun can stop for photos with Disney characters. “It is unusual that you get both ends of the running gamut,” Bisienere said. Entry fees, which include a shirt and medal, range from $60 for a 5K, to $170-$195 for a marathon or half marathon. A visit to the park to ride the attractions costs extra. Fans say the Disney experience is worth the price. At the Avengers race, which wound through Disneyland and the nearby Angel Stadium, runners carried red, white and blue Captain America shields and cardboard versions of Thor’s hammer, or sported Mickey Mouse ears. JT Rose, 42, from Kingsport, Tennessee, in his seventh Disney race, ran as Thor’s brother Loki, with a homemade staff and helmet. “Everybody who comes to Disney gets into it,” said Rose. “All the fans are just going crazy. It’s just a really fun race.” ",1072015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-disney-races/feature-off-to-the-races-disney-park-runs-mix-fitness-fantasy-idUSL2N0RV01C20150107
861,DIS,"Disney, Sony, DreamWorks seek to throw out anti-poaching lawsuit","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co, Sony Corp and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc urged a federal judge to throw out a antitrust lawsuit accusing them of conspiring not to poach each other’s animators in order to keep wages down. The defendants told U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, that the plaintiff animators took too long to sue by waiting until five years after the U.S. Department of Justice in 2009 began probing recruiting practices at Silicon Valley and other technology companies. In a Friday night filing, the defendants also called it “implausible” to believe they would collude to suppress wages after the federal probe began, and after several companies including Disney had settled related private litigation. “The court might ask what, exactly, these plaintiffs have uncovered that was somehow missed by the industrious High-Tech plaintiffs,” the companies said. “The short answer is: nothing.” Daniel Small, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined immediate comment on Monday, saying he had yet to review the defendants’ filings. Blue Sky Studios, a unit of 21st Century Fox Inc, is also a defendant. Lighting artist Georgia Cano, character effects artist Robert Nitsch and production engineer David Wentworth are the named plaintiffs. The lawsuit accuses the defendants of having illegally suppressed animators’ wages since 2004 by agreeing not to cold call employees, alerting each other to hiring offers, and agreeing not to offer more pay in response to counteroffers. Disney’s Lucasfilm and Pixar units, and Intuit Inc  settled similar claims covering other workers for a combined $20 million, while Apple Inc, Google Inc, Intel Corp and Adobe Systems Inc reached their own $324.5 million settlement last May. Koh last August rejected the $324.5 million accord as too low. Technology workers later asked the federal appeals court in San Francisco to overturn that ruling. As in other anti-poaching lawsuits, the animators’ lawsuit relies in part on emails and testimony under oath. It cites, among other things, a 2005 email from a Pixar human resources executive alluding to a “gentleman’s agreement” not to poach, and testimony in which Lucasfilm founder and “Star Wars” director George Lucas was said to want to avoid bidding wars “because we don’t have the margins for that sort of thing.” A hearing on the dismissal motion is set for March 26.

869,DIS,"UPDATE 3-Mattel CEO feels ""sense of urgency"" for new toys as Barbie ages","(Adds CEO comments, details from conference call; updates shares) By Shailaja Sharma Jan 30 (Reuters) - Mattel Inc needs to move with a “sense of urgency” to create toys that connect with young customers, its interim CEO said, as dolls based on Disney’s blockbuster film “Frozen” stole the show from its Barbie dolls in the holiday quarter. The company, which also makes Fisher-Price preschool toys and Monster High and American Girl dolls, reported its fifth straight fall in worldwide quarterly sales on Friday. Mattel’s shares were unchanged in noon trading, recovering from a 2.6 percent drop earlier. Worldwide sales of Barbie fell 12 percent in the fourth quarter, while those of Fisher-Price toys declined 11 percent. Christopher Sinclair, who took Mattel’s reins after it removed Bryan Stockton as CEO on Monday, said the company’s brand propositions were not compelling enough, mainly for Barbie and Fisher-Price. Mattel spent 40 percent more on advertising in the quarter, but that did not translate into sales, Sinclair said. Industry-wide toy sales in the United States rose 4 percent in 2014, according to consumer research firm NPD Group. In the period, Mattel’s sales fell 7 percent, highlighting the company’s failure to innovate faster than smaller rivals Jakks Pacific Inc and Hasbro Inc. Jakks makes dolls based on “Frozen”, such as Snow Glow Elsa and Anna Ice Skating doll. Hasbro’s products include My Little Pony toys and “Hunger Games” inspired Nerf Rebelle bow and arrow toys. Mattel’s sales fell in six of the 12 quarters that Stockton was CEO. He took the top job in 2012. Barbie sales have been falling for the past two years as young girls increasingly favor electronic toys, tablets and toys based on popular films. Denmark’s privately held Lego Group dethroned Mattel as the world’s largest toymaker by sales in the first half of 2014, helped by the success of its toys based on “The Lego Movie”. Lego is yet to report full-year sales. Most of Mattel’s revenue comes from brands that are at least three decades old. Fisher-Price was launched in 1930, Barbie in 1959 and American Girl in 1986. The company’s net income plunged nearly 60 percent to $149.9 million, or 44 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. Excluding items, Mattel earned 52 cents per share, lower than the average analyst estimate of 92 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Worldwide sales fell about 6 percent to $1.99 billion.

Disney’s shares rose 4.4 percent to $98.23 after the bell on Tuesday. The stock reached record highs in recent months as the company reported strong performances across its TV networks, theme parks and movie studio. Each of its five divisions reported higher operating income for the quarter. Operating income at Disney’s parks and resorts rose 20 percent to $805 million in the company’s fiscal first quarter,  ended Dec. 27, when more people visited its parks in the United States. They also spent more on tickets, merchandise, food and drinks. Chief Executive Bob Iger told CNBC that there had been no discernable impact on parks from a measles outbreak that health officials have said began at Disneyland in Anaheim in December. Disney now plans to open its Shanghai Disneyland theme park in the spring of 2016, Iger told analysts. The company had earlier set a target of a late 2015 opening but decided to add attractions to the park, a $5.5 billion joint venture with China’s state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group. “Frozen” toys sold particularly well during the holiday shopping quarter, leading Disney’s consumer products division to a profit of $626 million, a 46 percent increase from a year earlier. Disney’s movie studio recorded a 33 percent jump in profit, driven by an increase in DVD sales. Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Frozen” and “Maleficent” sold well, the company said. Disney said the studio also profited from lower home entertainment production and distribution costs in the quarter. Profit at the company’s biggest unit, cable networks, fell 2 percent, hurt by higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue at its sports channel, ESPN. Net income attributable to Walt Disney rose to $2.18 billion, or $1.27 per share, in the first quarter, from $1.84 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.27 per share. Revenue rose 8.8 percent to $13.39 billion from $12.31 billion.

Results from consumer studies and weather concerns had also played a part in the decision, said the person, adding that the change would likely be confirmed by the company on a Tuesday conference call. U.S.-based Walt Disney officials were not immediately available to comment. The $5.5 billion theme park is being jointly developed with China’s state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group. In April, the firms said they would increase investment in the theme park by $800 million, which would be used primarily to fund additional attractions.

The benchmark index added to losses late in the session after the European Central Bank abruptly cancelled its acceptance of Greek bonds in return for funding. The move means the Greek central bank will have to provide its banks with tens of billions of euros of additional emergency liquidity in coming weeks. “It’s kind of reconfirming what we’ve thought for a while, which is that there is going to be a liquidity crunch if they don’t resolve this Greek situation,” said Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets Inc in Boston. “They make a little bit of progress and then they kind of fall back.” Shares of the Global X FTSE Greece 20 exchange-traded fund  dropped 10.4 percent, with volume spiking late in the session.

884,DIS,'Frozen' still hot as Disney profit beats forecasts,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) quarterly profit topped Wall Street’s  estimates as its blockbuster animated film “Frozen” heated up home entertainment and toy sales, and visitors flocked to the company’s U.S. theme parks. Disney shares rose 4.4 percent to $98.23 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. The stock reached record highs in recent months on strong performances across its TV networks, theme parks and movie studio. Each of its five divisions reported higher operating income for the quarter, ended Dec. 27. At Disney’s parks unit, operating income rose 20 percent to $805 million as more people visited its U.S. parks and increased spending on tickets, merchandise, food and drinks. Chief Executive Bob Iger told CNBC that there had been no discernable impact on parks from a measles outbreak that health officials have said began at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, in December. Disney now plans to open its Shanghai Disneyland theme park in the spring of 2016, Iger told analysts. The company had earlier set a target of a late 2015 opening but decided to add attractions to the park, a $5.5 billion joint venture with China’s state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group. “Frozen” toys sold particularly well during the holiday shopping quarter, helping Disney’s consumer products unit earn a $626 million profit, up 46 percent from a year earlier.  Disney will fuel the franchise with “Frozen Fever” a seven-minute film that features a new song and will be shown in theaters ahead of its live action “Cinderella” movie, to be  released on March 13. “We actually believe it’s going to generate some more buzz for ‘Frozen,’ and that should generate more buying in terms of consumer products,” Iger said.  Disney’s movie studio recorded a 33 percent jump in profit, driven by home entertainment sales of “Frozen,” Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Maleficent.”  Profit at cable networks fell 2 percent, hurt by higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue at sports channel ESPN. Broadcasting unit ABC recorded a 35 percent increase in operating income from higher affiliate fees and program sales. Net profit attributable to Walt Disney rose to $2.18 billion, or $1.27 per share, in the quarter, from $1.03 per share a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.27 per share. Revenue rose 8.8 percent to $13.39 billion. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.07 per share on revenue of $12.87 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Staggs will assume the role of COO immediately while he continues to run the parks business until a successor is named, Disney said in a statement. Disney shares rose 1.2 percent to $102.52 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  The 63-year-old Iger, who has led Disney to record profits, recently extended his contract for a second time through June 2018. Staggs and Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo have been considered the top candidates to replace Iger, Wall Street analysts said. Disney operates television networks including ABC and ESPN, theme parks on three continents, a movie studio and gaming and consumer products divisions. The company blew past Wall Street estimates when it released quarterly results on Tuesday, driving its stock to record highs.      Staggs, 54, is a 25-year veteran of Disney and previously served as CFO. He became head of the parks division in 2010, when Iger switched the jobs of Rasulo and Staggs so each could broaden experience. Elevating Staggs puts him at the top of the list of candidates to lead Disney when Iger leaves, Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said. “I think it’s likely he’s Iger’s successor,” Harrigan said.     “They are trying to give him even more familiarity with all the businesses.”  No decision has been made about who will be the next CEO, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who noted Iger has more than three years left on his contract. Disney’s senior management will report jointly to Iger and Staggs with a few exceptions, including the CFO. Staggs has won accolades for growing the parks business, expanding Disney’s California Adventure and overseeing a Shanghai theme park that will open next year.

888,DIS,Sell out: Seattle home tied to Disney's 'Up' movie to be auctioned,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - A century-old Seattle house that was featured in a marketing stunt to publicize Walt Disney Co’s balloon adventure movie “Up” because it is wedged in the middle of a modern development could be sold at auction next month, media reported on Friday. Edith Macefield drew national media coverage when she refused in 2006 a $1 million offer for her 1,000-square-foot house from an investment company that eventually developed a 131,000-square-foot retail and office center around the home.  She died in 2008 and willed her house to a construction superintendent she had befriended. He sold the house in 2009. The company that now owns the boarded-up house owes nearly $186,000 and, unless the debt is paid off, the property will be auctioned on March 13, newspaper website Seattlepi.com reported, citing a foreclosure notice. Publicists in 2009 tied a cluster of balloons to the little two-story bungalow in Seattle in a marketing stunt for “Up,” about a curmudgeonly old man who refuses to sell his home and flies off in the house tied to balloons.  The display fell flat, however, as many of the balloons popped after being driven into surrounding walls by winds and it never achieved its intended aesthetic, Seattlepi.com reported. The movie, by Disney-Pixar, made more than $700 million at worldwide box offices and won an Oscar for the best animated movie in 2010.

891,DIS,Disney's Magic Kingdom one-day passes breach $100 mark,"ORLANDO, Fla., Feb 22 (Reuters) - A one-day ticket to the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Orlando jumped on Sunday to $105 from $99, an increase that likely makes the Florida family attraction the first in the industry to breach the $100 psychological barrier. All other Walt Disney Co parks in Orlando and California increased prices for one-day, one-park admission, but they remained slightly below $100. Disneyland and Disney California now cost $99 while Orlando’s Epcot, Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios cost $97. Taxes are extra for all tickets. John Gerner, managing partner of Leisure Business Advisors, said he was not surprised that Disney chose the Magic Kingdom to test triple-digit pricing. “In the minds of a lot of theme park enthusiasts, especially those that love Disney, it is seen as being essentially priceless,” Gerner said. Gerner said he knows of no other U.S. theme park with ticket prices over $100. Disney did not immediately return a call from Reuters but provided a prepared statement to the Orlando Sentinel. “A day at a Disney park is unlike any other in the world, and there is strong demand for our attractions and entertainment,” spokesman Bryan Malenius wrote to the newspaper. Gerner said it would be difficult to determine whether the price increase would have an impact on attendance, given so many other variables such as weather and the addition of new rides. If the sting of triple-digit ticket prices pushes more guests to seek a better value by choosing multi-day and resort packages, the company will benefit from stronger hotel and restaurant revenue. Those streams are more important to Disney’s bottom line than ticket revenue, Gerner said. Typically, SeaWorld Orlando and Universal Orlando raise prices soon after Disney, but both parks’ prices have room to grow before reaching $100. One-day, one-park adult tickets to Universal are $96 while SeaWorld tickets range from $70 for a weekday admission and $80 for any day, according to their websites. Disney operates television networks including ABC and ESPN, theme parks on three continents, a movie studio and gaming and consumer products divisions. The company blew past Wall Street estimates when it released quarterly results earlier this month, driving its stock to record highs.

892,DIS,Disney names Chapek chairman of parks and resorts,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co named consumer products chief Bob Chapek the new chairman of its parks and resorts division, the company said in a statement on Monday. Chapek replaces Thomas Staggs, who was appointed Disney’s chief operating officer earlier this month.  In the new role, Chapek will oversee a unit that employs 130,000 people around the world and is preparing to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai next year. Chapek, 55, has worked at Disney for 22 years, and has served as president of the consumer products unit since 2011. At consumer products, Chapek turned the division into one of the media company’s fastest-growing segments, in part by organizing it around franchises rather than product categories. The unit reported operating income of $626 million for the quarter that ended in December, a 46 percent gain from a year earlier.

895,DIS,UPDATE 1-'Big Hero 6' wins best animated feature Oscar,"(Adds details, quotes and background) LOS ANGELES, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Disney Animation’s “Big Hero 6,” a comic book-inspired tale of a teen science genius who befriends a huggable robot and forms a superhero team, won the Academy Award for best animated feature film on Sunday. “This has been an amazing year for animated films and we are privileged to be in your company,” said co-director Don Hall. He was the second winner of the night to make a point of thanking his parents, after best supporting actor J.K. Simmons made a passionate speech urging people to call their parents and thank them. “One upon a time there was a freckle-faced little boy who told his mom and his dad he was going to work at Walt Disney Animation and they did something amazing. They supported him,” Hall said. “Big Hero 6,” released in November last year, was Disney’s first animated film foray into the Marvel comics universe, fusing Japanese influences into American pop culture. The film’s superheroes use scientific knowledge to create their superpowers, and its protagonist Hiro endures both sorrow and joy in his journey to save his city from an evil masked villain. “30 Rock” actor Scott Adsit voiced huggable healthcare robot Baymax, while rising star Ryan Potter voiced Hiro. To date, the film, directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams, has made more than $521 million at the worldwide box office. “Big Hero 6” earned the second consecutive Academy Award win in the animated feature category for Walt Disney Co’s  animation studios, which won last year for musical blockbuster “Frozen.” The animation feature Oscar category was first handed out in 2002, and has been dominated by Disney-owned Pixar, which has won seven Academy Awards. Pixar did not release a film in 2014. “Big Hero 6” beat out DreamWorks Animation’s “How to Train Your Dragon 2,” Laika Studios’ “The Boxtrolls,” Studio Ghibli’s  “The Tale of the Princess Kaguya” and Irish studio Cartoon Saloon’s “Song of the Sea.”   (Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Sandra Maler)",2232015,http://www.reuters.com/article/awards-oscars-animation/update-1-big-hero-6-wins-best-animated-feature-oscar-idUSL1N0VS00S20150223

901,DIS,Disney feeds 'Frozen' frenzy with news of sequel,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co has started work on a sequel to “Frozen,” the best-selling animated movie of all time and a global merchandising phenomenon that helped push the media giant to record profits. Directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are returning for the sequel, Disney said on Thursday. No release date was set for the follow-up to “Frozen”, a surprise smash in 2013 that brought in nearly $1.3 billion in global ticket sales. Disney also said it will release the eighth episode in the “Star Wars” sci-fi film series on May 26, 2017. A spinoff film called “Rogue One” debuts on Dec. 16, 2016, shortly after the release of highly anticipated seventh episode, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” The company made the announcements at its annual shareholder meeting in San Francisco, where investors re-elected 10 board members including Chief Executive Bob Iger and defeated a proposal to split the roles of CEO and chairman. The news of a “Frozen” sequel comes hours before short film “Frozen Fever” opens for Disney’s live-action “Cinderella” movie, which debuts Friday. “We enjoyed making ‘Frozen Fever’ so much and being back in that world with those characters,” said John Lasseter, chief creative officer for Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios. “Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck have come up with a great idea for a sequel.”    Lasseter spoke alongside Josh Gad, who provided the voice of the snowman Olaf in “Frozen.” Iger said Olaf will appear in the second film. “Frozen” tells the story of two royal sisters, Anna and Elsa, in an icy Nordic kingdom. Kristen Bell voices Anna, and Idina Menzel is Elsa. On “Star Wars,” Iger said “Rogue One” will star Oscar best actress nominee Felicity Jones. British director Gareth Edwards, who did the “Godzilla” remake, had previously been announced as director of the spin-off. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is one of the most anticipated films of the year, directed by J.J. Abrams and starring returning franchise stars Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and newcomers Oscar Isaac and Lupita Nyong’o. Two shareholder proposals were rejected at the meeting, according to preliminary tallies. One would have required that future CEOs be prevented from also holding the title of chairman, as Iger does now. A second proposal would have placed limits on accelerated executive pay. Disney shares rose 3.9 percent to $106.78 on the New York Stock Exchange and are up 25 percent in the past year.

902,DIS,US STOCKS-Wall St bounces back in broad rally; bank shares gain,"* Wall St coming off extended decline * Bank stocks higher after Fed stress tests * Intel shares fall after lowered outlook * Indexes up: Dow 1.5 pct, S&P; 1.3 pct, Nasdaq 0.9 pct   (Updates close with latest volume, Disney, Mattel shares up) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a broad rally on Thursday, bouncing back from two days of losses, helped by weaker retail sales that paused the dollar’s recent rally and tempered the outlook for interest rates. The day’s gains lifted the Dow and S&P; 500 back into positive territory for the year so far. Banking shares rallied following the Federal Reserve’s annual check-up on the industry’s health. The S&P; financial sector rose 2.2 percent and was the day’s biggest gainer. A weak outlook from Intel, however, limited gains in the tech sector. Retail sales unexpectedly dropped for a third month in February, which helped the euro rebound from a 12-year low versus the dollar. Recent weakness in stocks has largely been driven by Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs data, which underscored views the Fed could raise rates as early as June. “To me, it shows maybe that moving the rate increase closer has potential fallout with regard to the ever-stronger U.S. dollar, and that’s a headwind for growth and a headwind for earnings for a lot of companies that do business outside the U.S.,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 259.83 points, or 1.47 percent, to 17,895.22, while the S&P; 500 gained 25.71 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,065.95. The day’s percentage gains were the biggest for both the Dow and S&P; 500 in about a month. The Nasdaq Composite added 43.35 points, or 0.89 percent, to 4,893.29. The rally represented just a partial rebound after a recent bout of weakness, which has left the S&P; 500 down 2.4 percent from its March 2 record closing high. Citigroup passed in the Fed review, allowing it to raise dividends and sending shares up 3.3 percent to $54.08. Bank of America was told to get a better grip on internal controls and its data models; shares slipped 0.1 percent to $16.09. Intel Corp slashed its first-quarter revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand for business PCs and lower inventory levels across the PC supply chain.  Shares of the Dow component fell 4.7 percent to $30.80 and limited the Nasdaq’s advance. Shares of Walt Disney Co rose 4.2 percent to $107.17 and were the biggest percentage gainer in the Dow after it said it has started work on a sequel to “Frozen,” the best-selling animated movie of all time. Shares of Mattel gained 4.2 percent to $25.65. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,241 to 823, for a 2.72-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,982 issues rose and 765 fell, a 2.59-to-1 ratio. The S&P; 500 index posted 22 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 136 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

908,DIS,Steve Jobs bio says Disney CEO kept Jobs' condition a secret: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co CEO Bob Iger learned that Steve Jobs’ cancer had returned less than an hour before Disney announced it was buying Jobs’ Pixar studio in 2006, and Iger kept the Apple co-founder’s condition a secret for three years, according to Bloomberg, citing a new biography of Jobs. Iger told the authors of “Becoming Steve Jobs” he thought about the implications of keeping such a secret at a time when regulators were calling for more disclosure and holding executives more accountable to their fiduciary duties, Bloomberg reported. The $7 billion deal to buy Pixar made Jobs Disney’s largest shareholder and put him on the entertainment company’s board. Iger decided that Disney was assessing the transaction on the value of Pixar, not Jobs, and his medical condition did not need to be disclosed, the biography said. Iger said Jobs told him that the cancer had returned while they were on a private walk at Pixar’s Emeryville, California, campus about 30 minutes before the deal was to be announced. “Frankly, they tell me I’ve got a 50-50 chance of living five years,” Iger quoted Jobs as saying. According to the book, Iger said he told Jobs: “You’re our largest shareholder, but I don’t think that makes this matter. You’re not material to this deal. We’re buying Pixar, we’re not buying you.” Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2003 and underwent surgery the following year. The tumor returned and he had a liver transplant in 2009. Jobs died in October 2011. The book, which will be published on Tuesday, paints a more sympathetic picture than the 2011 biography by Walter Isaacson, who devoted several passages in his book to Jobs’ messy personal life and mercurial temperament, Bloomberg said.

910,DIS,Driving instructor killed in Disney World race car crash,"ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - A passenger killed in a crash at a Walt Disney World Speedway race-car attraction has been identified as an instructor who was riding in a Lamborghini that hit a guardrail after the driver lost control, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The instructor was 36-year-old Gary Terry, a senior operations manager at Exotic Driving Experience, the highway patrol said. Terry, who lived in Davenport a few miles south-west of Orlando, died at the scene on Sunday. The driver, Tavon Watson, 24, of Kissimmee, who was taking the ride as a 24th birthday treat, suffered only minor injuries. The estimated speed of the crash was 100 mph (160 kph), according to the highway patrol.      The Exotic Driving Experience attraction is offered by North Carolina-based Petty Holdings, which markets products licensed under the name of retired NASCAR stock car racer Richard Petty. No racing experience is required to drive one of the exotic cars, which also include Ferraris, Audis, Nissans and Porsches, according to the attraction’s website. Maximum speeds vary depending on the driver’s experience, location and other factors. A professional driving instructor provides coaching and feedback from the passenger seat, according to the website. “There are no pedals or steering wheel (on the instructor’s side of the car),” said spokeswoman Lauren Swoboda. “There’s a throttle control.” The FHP reported both men were wearing lap and seat belts, as well as helmets, in the Super Leggera Lamborghini. “Yesterday we lost a long-time, valued team member of the Exotic Driving Experience family,” the company said in a statement on Monday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Gary’s family and friends. He will be sorely missed,” it added. The company also announced the attraction would remain closed Monday and Tuesday. Unrelated to the fatal accident, the Driving Experience, which opened in January 2012 at the Walt Disney World Speedway, is scheduled to close on Aug. 9.

The driver, Tavon Watson, 24, of Kissimmee, was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The estimated speed of the crash was 100 mph, according to the highway patrol. The Exotic Driving Experience attraction is offered by North Carolina-based Petty Holdings, which markets products licensed under the name of retired NASCAR stock car racer Richard Petty. No racing experience is required to drive one of the exotic cars, which also include Ferraris, Audis, Nissans and Porsches, according to the attraction’s web site. Maximum speeds vary depending on the driver’s experience, location and other factors. A professional driving instructor provides coaching and feedback from the passenger seat, according to the website. “There are no pedals or steering wheel (on the instructor’s side of the car),” said spokeswoman Lauren Swoboda. “There’s a throttle control.” The FHP reported both men were wearing lap and seat belts, as well as helmets, in the Super Leggera Lamborghini. “Yesterday we lost a long-time, valued team member of the Exotic Driving Experience family,” the company said in a statement on Monday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Gary’s family and friends. He will be sorely missed,” it added. The company also announced the attraction would remain closed Monday and Tuesday. Unrelated to the fatal accident, the driving experience, which opened January 2012 at the Walt Disney World Speedway, is scheduled to close on August 9.

912,DIS,"UPDATE 3-Mattel's sales beat estimates, shares rise","(Adds forecast, background) By Shailaja Sharma April 16 (Reuters) - Mattel Inc’s quarterly net sales topped analysts’ estimates for the first time in six quarters as new Chief Executive Christopher Sinclair focuses on turning around the business in the face of flagging sales of Barbie dolls. Mattel’s shares rose 6.6 percent to $26.94 in aftermarket trading on Thursday. They have lost more than a third of their value in the past 12 months. The toymaker reported a 2.5 percent decline in net sales in the three months ended March 31, during which Sinclair was appointed as interim CEO. He took the post permanently this month. Worldwide sales of Barbie dolls fell 5 percent on a constant currency basis, while sales of Fisher-Price preschool toys rose 3 percent. Sinclair, a former PepsiCo Inc executive who has been on Mattel’s board since 1996, has said the company needs to move with a “sense of urgency” to create toys that connect with young customers. “The board and I don’t want to waste time in moving forward with the necessary changes to revitalize the business... We certainly were too slow to adapt and react to rapidly changing technology and competitive landscape,” Sinclair said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday. Barbie dolls, which have been around for 56 years, have been losing ground to electronic toys, tablets and merchandise based on popular films such as Disney’s “Frozen”. Mattel also faces intense competition from rivals such as Denmark’s Lego Group and U.S.-based Hasbro Inc, which have been growing sales despite weak consumer spending and high competition. Analysts, however, do not expect Mattel’s sales to return to growth before 2016, when it loses the license to make Walt Disney Co’s Disney Princess dolls, including those based on the movie “Frozen”. Hasbro has won the license. But for this year, its sales are expected to receive a boost from sequels to “Star Wars”, “The Avengers” and “Jurassic Park”. A strong dollar will hurt Mattel’s revenue growth by 4-6 percent and earnings by 30-35 cents per share in 2015, Sinclair said. Net loss attributable to Mattel widened to $58.2 million, or 17 cents per share, in the first quarter from $11.2 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the loss was 8 cents per share. Sales were to $922.7 million. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 9 cents per share on revenue of $901.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

913,DIS,UPDATE 1-ESPN says Verizon made unilateral decision on custom TV offerings,"(Adds Verizon comments) By Lisa Richwine and Malathi Nayak April 22 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc acted on its own when the company decided how to offer ESPN and other Walt Disney Co channels in smaller custom TV packages, a spokeswoman for ESPN said on Wednesday. Disney, Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox have said Verizon’s slimmer TV bundles violate existing agreements. The new offerings let customers sign up for a slimmed-down, cheaper bundle of 36 fixed channels through Verizon’s FiOS TV and add on genre-specific packages such as kids, sports or news. “The issue here is that Verizon made unilateral decisions on how to offer ABC Family, Disney Channels, ESPN and ESPN2 that are in violation of our existing agreements,” the spokeswoman said. Disney has teamed with other distributors on new TV packages. It made a landmark deal last year to include its programming on Dish Network Corp’s Sling TV, a smaller channel bundle delivered over the Internet. “The Walt Disney Company is at the forefront of working with distributors to create new and innovative consumer offerings,” the ESPN spokeswoman said. Verizon has said it believes the company is within its legal rights to offer the new custom packages and will keep selling them. “Nobody likes change and everybody resists change,” Verizon Chief Financial Officer Frank Shammo said in an interview on Tuesday. “It’s changing the model that’s been existing for twenty-some years. But this is all about the consumer.” On Sunday, Verizon unveiled its new pay TV plan that allows consumers to choose every month bundles of channels they want to see, hoping the flexibility will lure customers away from cable rivals and upstart online TV companies. The new service does not offer “a la carte” programming, or allow customers to build their own pay TV service, channel by channel. But is a step closer to that type of service.

917,DIS,"ESPN sues Verizon, escalates battle over new pay TV offering","(Reuters) - ESPN sued Verizon Communications (VZ.N) on Monday for breach of contract involving a new pay TV offering, as the cable sports network fired the latest volley in a mounting battle with the telecommunications company. ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), said in a legal document sent to the Supreme Court of New York State that Verizon violated its obligations “under certain license agreements” and it wants Verizon to pay. The dispute involves Verizon’s new pay TV plan, offering consumers a slimmer package of channels targeting genre-specific packages such as sports, kids or news. In traditional subscriptions, customers pay for a large group of networks that often include ESPN. ESPN and other media companies with a lot of sports content say the package violates their contracts with Verizon. A Verizon spokesman said the company is in compliance of existing agreements.  “Consumers have spoken loud and clear that they want choice and the industry should be focused on what the consumer wants and giving them what they want,” A Verizon spokesman said. ESPN said in a statement, “ESPN is at the forefront of embracing innovative ways to deliver high-quality content and value to consumers on multiple platforms, but that must be done in compliance with our agreements.  We simply ask that Verizon abide by the terms of our contracts.” Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) and Comcast’s (CMCSA.O) NBC Universal also said last week that the new Verizon offering violated the terms of their contracts. It was unclear whether Fox and NBC planned to follow ESPN’s lead and file suit. A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment. A spokesman for Fox was not immediately available to comment.

919,DIS,"Samsung, Marvel use virtual reality for 'Avenger' movie ads","(Reuters) - Samsung and Walt Disney’s Marvel introduced a marketing campaign that uses virtual reality to promote “Avengers: Age of Ultron” as more studios look to the new technology to push movies.  The Avengers ad campaign, launched last week, employs VR that immerses a user in a 3D world and makes them feel as if they are in the action. Jamie Park, head of experimental marketing at Samsung, said the company had seen a growing interest from studios in virtual reality (VR) and Samsung would be doing more of this in the future. “It’s less about taking the movie content and putting it directly into VR and more about figuring out the best way to enhance the overall content,” Park said. Created by Los Angeles-based advertising firm 72andSunny, the short films give people a chance to feel what it is like to be one of the superhero characters such as Iron Man and Captain America in the Avengers. The campaign is made to work with Samsung’s GS6 smartphone that fits with the company’s VR glasses, Samsung Gear VR, though the films can be viewed on Android smartphones or any Web browser. Fox Searchlight’s “Wild” also used VR to promote the movie with Samsung’s Gear VR headset. “It’s an ambition that is deeper than product placement,” said Bryan Rowles, executive creative director at 72andSunny. “It’s rare to work on a piece of technology in its infancy. It will be interesting to see where it goes and if it will catch on.” One of the short VR films for the Avengers movie co-stars international sports figures including soccer star Lionel Messi and professional football player Eddie Lacy, and shows their experience being transformed into a super heroes.  In another, a user experiences a battle between the Avengers and a robot army, in 3D slow motion, with a 360-degree view. Virtual reality (VR) is known among gamers who use the gear to enhance playing videogames, but the technology could start appealing to a broader base of consumers. Facebook, for example, bought VR startup Oculus Rift for $2 billion last year.

Energy stocks retreated after a brief rally. The $51.4 billion deficit was the highest in nearly 6-1/2 years and larger than the $45.2 billion the government assumed in its snapshot of first-quarter gross domestic product last week. “Everyone is now keeping an eye on Friday’s jobs numbers to see if last month’s dismal numbers were a momentary blip or for real,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. The wider trade deficit dampened the effect of a rebound in service sector growth in April. All 10 major S&P; sectors were down, with the utilities index  down 2.2 percent. The energy sector was off 0.5 percent, reversing course after having risen earlier in the session as oil prices hit their highest this year. Technology stocks, led by Apple, were the biggest drag on the three major indexes and nearly wiped out the Nasdaq’s gains in the past two days. At 13:14 p.m. EDT (1714 GMT) the Nasdaq Composite  was down 70.94 points, or 1.41 percent, at 4,945.99, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 106.63 points, or 0.59 percent, at 17,963.77, and the S&P; 500 was down 19.58 points, or 0.93 percent, at 2,094.91. Dow component Disney was up 0.5 percent at $111.64 after hitting a record high of $113.30. The company’s quarterly revenue beat analysts’ expectations. Kellogg fell 2.3 percent to $62.65 after the world’s largest maker of breakfast cereals’ net sales fell 5 percent. Cosmetics maker Estee Lauder rose to a record high of $89.84 after it reported better-than-expected profit. The stock later slipped back to $88.25, up 5.7 percent. Netflix was up 3.2 percent at $574.54 after BofA Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to “buy” from “underperform”.

The company’s shares rose as much as 2 percent to a record high of $113.30 in early trading. Up to Monday’s close, they had gained 38 percent in the past year. Results for the quarter were also boosted by a surge in sales of toys and merchandise related to blockbuster animated film “Frozen”. While the studio business failed to keep pace with last year’s “Frozen”-fueled growth, “The Avengers: Age of Ultron” is expected to boost revenue in the current quarter. The sequel opened last weekend with $191.2 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada — the second-biggest opening of all time. “As much as the quarter itself was strong the outlook for the next few quarters, with so many big franchise properties coming to market, looks to be just as good,” Macquarie Research analyst Timothy Nollen told Reuters. Revenue at theme parks rose 6 percent to $3.76 billion, pushing up the unit’s operating income 24 percent as ticket prices and hotel room rates increased and visitors spent more on food, drinks and merchandise. Total revenue rose 7 percent to $12.46 billion in the second quarter ended March 28, topping the average analyst estimate of $12.25 billion. Net income attributable to Walt Disney of $1.23 per share also beat the average analyst estimate of $1.11 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Walt Disney’s media networks business, which includes sports powerhouse ESPN, the Disney channels and ABC, reported a 13 percent rise in revenue to $5.81 billion, helped by higher ad sales and affiliate fees. Higher programing and production costs at ESPN, however, pushed the unit’s operating income down 2 percent.

The U.S. trade deficit surged to its highest level in nearly 6-1/2 years in March and the $51.4 billion trade gap was far larger than the $45.2 billion deficit the government assumed in its snapshot of first-quarter gross domestic product last week. A now-settled labor dispute at West Coast ports had significantly slowed trade at the start of the year. The dollar’s surge has also weighed on trade and on corporate earnings reports. About 68 percent of the S&P; companies that have reported results so far, have reported earnings above analysts’ estimates, above the 63 percent that typically beat in a quarter. However, only 44.4 percent have beaten on revenue, below the typical 61 percent. “The dollar is clearly one factor in the lower revenue number,” said Tom Donino, co-head of trading at First New York Securities in New York. “The dollar has probably peaked in the short term and I think its going to be range bound through the summer.” S&P; 500 e-mini futures were down 7.25 points and their fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a lower open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures fell 61 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures lost 23.25 points. Dow component Disney rose 2.2 percent to $113.50 in premarket trading after it’s quarterly revenue beat analysts’ expectations. Tesla gained 3.3 percent to $238.20 after Jefferies started coverage with a “buy” rating, saying investors worries about China sales are overblown. Discovery Communications rose 5.2 percent to $32.50, while cosmetics maker Estee Lauder rose 5.1 percent to $87.80 after both companies reported better-than-expected profits.

931,DIS,Disney to bring mobile technology to more parks,"ANAHEIM, California (Reuters) - The mobile technology that helps Walt Disney Co theme park guests beat lines and pay for Mickey Mouse ears at the company’s flagship resort in Florida will expand in some form to other Disney resorts, Chief Operating Officer Tom Staggs said.    The $1 billion MyMagic+ program features wristbands and a mobile app that let Walt Disney World visitors unlock hotel room doors, pay for food and merchandise, and book dinner reservations or ride times.  The technology aims to help people plan trips in advance, move more quickly through the park and personalize visits. More than 11 million wristbands, called MagicBands, have been used.  “The folks who are saying the MyMagic+ experience is excellent is the vast, vast majority of folks who are using it, and that, we know, is good for our business,” Staggs said on Thursday. Staggs spoke in an interview on the patio of an apartment once occupied by Walt Disney at the Disneyland Resort, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year. The executive ran the Disney parks and resorts division from 2010 until his promotion in February to chief operating officer, which put him in the lead to succeed Chief Executive Bob Iger in 2018.  The parks unit’s earnings have climbed over the past few years as Disney invested billions to add Cars Land at the Anaheim resort, expanded Fantasyland at Walt Disney World, built a new cruise ship and made other improvements.  For the six months that ended March 28, operating income rose 22 percent to $1.4 billion. It is Disney’s second-largest division.   Adding new technology is one way Disney aims to keep the business growing.   “We will bring variations on MyMagic+ to our parks and other businesses around the world,” Staggs said.  He said it was “possible” the use of the MagicBands will be enabled at parks outside of Walt Disney World. The company also is exploring if other wearable technology could offer some of the same functions as consumers adopt new products such as the Apple Watch.  “We are really open to doing that,” Staggs said, though he said there were no plans specifically for the Apple Watch. As part of its 60th anniversary, Disneyland is unveiling new night-time entertainment including a fireworks show that adds projections inside the park. Classic characters such as Mickey will appear along with new ones such as Anna and Elsa from blockbuster movie “Frozen,” part of Disney’s strategy of bringing its hit franchises into the parks.

932,DIS,Disney shares may rise 50 percent in three years: Barron's,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co could climb 50 percent over the next three years on its uncanny ability to generate profits from its businesses including movies, merchandise and parks and cruise lines, Barron’s said in its latest edition published on Sunday. Wall Street analysts forecast the Burbank, California-based entertainment and media company will grow its earnings per share by 16 percent this year to $5.03 and 13 percent next year to $5.67. This put Disney’s stock price at 18 times earnings, the financial weekly said. On Friday, Disney shares closed at $110.37, about $3 below its high set on May 5. This compared with the $165 Barron’s said they could achieve by 2018. Analysts anticipate a string of box office hits over the next few years including the seventh installation of the “Star Wars” saga by the end of this year, according to Barron’s. Shanghai Disney, which is set open next spring, should score handsomely for the company’s parks and resorts division. Disney is a 43 percent owner of the park, while Chinese firms own the rest, Barron’s said. It hasn’t been all smooth sailing for Disney.  Its “Tomorrowland” took in $32.2 million in its opening weekend at the movie box last weekend, falling short of expectations. The Internet has cut into its television ratings, Barron’s added. “These seem offset by potential rewards. Few companies right now have more or bigger likely winners on the horizon,” the paper said.

939,DIS,RPT-INSIGHT-Disney's powerful marketing force: social media moms,"(Repeating without changes to text for additional clients) By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, June 15 (Reuters) - Wendy Wright is a home-schooling mother of two, a prolific blogger and a self-described “Disney Nut.” Her cats are named Mickey and Minnie, and her blog is filled with advice for visiting Disneyland, tips for holding Disney-themed parties and reviews of Disney movies. Wright’s enthusiasm for all things Disney eventually drew the attention of the Walt Disney Co, which invited her to join a carefully vetted group of roughly 1,300 Disney Social Media Moms. The group of mothers - and a few fathers - are part of a Disney effort to incorporate the enthusiasm and influence of parents into its marketing efforts. Wright isn’t sure why she was picked, but guesses her online postings about Disney helped. “There’s been a lot on social media about our trips to Disney,” said Wright, who writes about technology, entertainment and other subjects from her home in Phoenix. “It’s very obvious we are a Disney family.” Disney moms are not paid, but they receive perks from the company for their efforts, including - for some - deeply discounted, four-day family trips to Walt Disney World for the Disney Social Media Moms Celebration, an event that is part vacation and part educational conference. Disney does not tell the mothers what to write or tweet about, and it doesn’t require them to post. Still, this year’s social media moms event in May generated 28,500 tweets, 4,900 Instagram photos and 88 blog posts full of ride reviews and videos of kids meeting Disney characters. And the moms’ postings are overwhelmingly positive. The theory is that mothers with a large online presence have the ability to influence travel and entertainment planning of other mothers. “For a big chunk of our guests, it’s the moms who are making decisions,” said Tom Staggs, Disney’s chief operating officer. The mothers say they like having a connection to Disney - as well as the possibility of scoring a spot at the Social Media Moms Celebration, which was first held in 2010. Each year, the company’s theme parks division e-mails invitations to 175 to 200 people. This year, the moms made #DisneySMMC a trending Twitter topic on the day the invitations went out. “A very magical invite with pixie dust arrived!” Wright tweeted on March 21. In the run-up to the celebration, the invitees posted on Pinterest the “Frozen”-inspired outfits and Mickey Mouse-adorned handbags they planned to bring to the Mother’s Day weekend event. Exactly how Disney chooses its social media moms is a mystery, stoking online speculation about the secret formula. One blog post that offered advice on how to get picked was shared 1,600 times. Common tips include interacting with Disney’s Twitter accounts and expressing interest in attending one of the smaller social media events Disney hosts in various cities. Disney executives will only say they look for moms who fit its family-friendly brand, use multiple social media platforms and are active in their communities offline. The moms include bloggers and book authors as well as radio, TV and YouTube personalities. They  tend to cover topics such as family life, parenting, cooking, travel and crafting in addition to their postings about Disney, and only a minority are superfans who write primarily about the company’s products and theme parks, social media moms said. This year’s celebration attendees had a combined Twitter following of 5 million people, or about 27,000 each on average. To get on Disney’s radar, Rachel Pitzel, a mother of two who lives in Playa Vista, California, filled out an online application for, and was accepted to, a social media event the company held in Scottsdale, Arizona last June. This year, she was thrilled to receive an invitation to the celebration in Orlando, Florida. “You feel like a kid again,” said Pitzel, CEO of Club MomMe, a social and educational group for parents. But the invitation doesn’t come free. Attendees get deep discounts, but they nevertheless pay for their packages, which include three nights at Disney’s Yacht Club Resort, theme park tickets, fast passes to skip lines and a beach-themed party. Families also pay for their own transportation. At the day-long conference, the moms attend motivational sessions and receive social media tips and Disney updates. This year, they learned how to use Pinterest data, heard from 11-year-old lemonade stand entrepreneur Vivienne Harr and listened to a Pixar producer talk about the Disney-owned animation studio. Disney reminds attendees of government requirements that they disclose the benefits they received when writing about the event. The company declined to disclose how much it spends on the program. Disney was the first major company to tap the influence of moms across a wide spectrum of social media, but the approach is now being used to promote a range of products, including Hewlett-Packard printers and Cottonelle toilet paper. HP hired 14 mom bloggers to post print-at-home craft and project ideas on a website called MyPrintly. Kimberly-Clark’s  Cottonelle brand paid a group of mom influencers to serve as roving reporters and share experiences at a New Kids on the Block concert it sponsored. Overall, moms spend $3.2 trillion annually in the U.S. economy, said Maria Bailey, a consultant who advised Disney on its social media effort and runs BSM Media, a marketing firm that connects brands with moms. “I have clients who call and say I want to do what Disney is doing,” Bailey said. “Companies want to capture the mom market.”   (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Dina Kyriakidou and Sue Horton)",6152015,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-moms/rpt-insight-disneys-powerful-marketing-force-social-media-moms-idUSL1N0YY1HP20150615

942,DIS,Disney exploring virtual reality for video games,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s interactive unit is considering bringing Disney Infinity or other video games into the world of virtual reality. Adapting elements of current titles is one option the company is exploring, James Pitaro, president of Disney Interactive, said in an interview. Disney also might create new games specifically for VR or for another emerging platform known as augmented reality, he said. Virtual reality headsets offer a 360-degree view that immerses players in fantasy settings, while augmented reality projects computer images onto real-world settings.  The technology has been touted for decades but never reached mass adoption, and the entertainment industry is debating whether it will take off this time. Disney Infinity, which has achieved $1 billion in global retail sales, mixes characters from Disney, Pixar and Marvel franchises. Star Wars will come to the new edition set for release this fall. The game includes a “toy box” mode allowing  players to mix backdrops and characters from different franchises.  “You could easily imagine a scenario where we were to expand the toy box component of Infinity into AR or VR,” Pitaro said in an interview at the E3 video game conference, although he added Disney does not have that project or any other VR projects in development. Disney is talking to the VR “platforms,” he said, without specifying which companies. Facebook Inc’s Oculus unit, Sony Corp and other companies will offer modern VR headsets to consumers later this year and next year.  Microsoft Corp generated buzz at E3 with a demonstration of its HoloLens AR headset using the Minecraft game. Pitaro said he was impressed with recent VR technology and was enthusiastic about its possibilities.  “I do not think this is going to be a fad,” Pitaro said. Some other companies showed VR prototypes at E3. Ubisoft, for example, demonstrated an experience that features its Rabbids characters and makes viewers feel like they’re riding a roller coaster. Other gaming executives have voiced caution, waiting to see if consumers embrace VR.  Barclays analyst Christopher Merwin said he believes VR will become a viable platform, eventually. Consumers will likely wait until there is a enough software available to justify the cost of VR hardware, he said. “Virtual reality is the future but it will take time,” Merwin said in a research note.

944,DIS,Disney bans selfie sticks at theme parks over safety concerns,"ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co will ban selfie sticks starting next week at its theme parks around the world, the company said on Friday, joining a growing list of attractions that restrict the camera accessories for safety reasons. Beginning Tuesday, the company will not allow selfie sticks - extension rods used for taking self-portraits with smartphones - at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, or Disneyland in Anaheim, California. The ban will begin on Wednesday at parks in Hong Kong and Paris. “We strive to provide a great experience for the entire family, and unfortunately selfie sticks have become a growing safety concern for both our guests and cast,” Disney spokeswoman Kim Prunty said in a statement. Disney tried allowing selfie sticks in the park but not on rides, according to Prunty. But violators were forcing park staff to stop rides for extended periods of time, including on Wednesday when a roller coaster was shut down at Disneyland, frustrating other guests. Starting next week, security personnel will ask Disney guests who arrive with selfie sticks at the parks to stow them at a storage facility or return the sticks to their hotels or cars, the company said. Major museums worldwide, including those in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, have banned the sticks. Other major tourist destinations such as the Palace of Versailles outside of Paris and the Colosseum in Rome as well as music festivals such as Coachella and Lollapalooza have also prohibited them. Universal Studios also bans selfie sticks on rides in its parks, spokesman Tom Schroder said  SeaWorld Entertainment Inc allows selfie sticks in the company’s parks but not on rides or over animal habitats, spokeswoman Becca Bides said.

945,DIS,Consumer Discretionary hedging activity up ahead of earnings,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors who have the most to win if Amazon, Disney and other consumer discretionary companies continue to push the sector higher are getting increasingly nervous, judging by their options activity. Options bets tied to declines in an exchange-traded fund tracking the sector have been unusually popular, even as the S&P; 500 consumer discretionary index has logged an 8 percent rise for the year, handily beating the S&P; 500 and turning in the second-best performance among the nine S&P; 500 sectors. Earlier in June, the open interest in puts on the consumer discretionary sector ETF touched highs not seen since October 2011. Currently there are two put contracts open for each open call, the most bearish this ratio has been in nine months. Open interest in puts has more than doubled to about 303,000 contracts over the last three months, compared with an 18 percent drop in calls, according to Trade Alert data.     Puts are option contracts that convey the right to sell shares at a predetermined price in the future and are often used to place bearish bets on shares.     But in this case, the surge in puts activity may not be signaling outright bearish sentiment.     “I think it’s more of a hedge,” said Scott Elisha, chief options strategist at Perigon Partners in San Francisco. Elisha was looking in particular at puts betting on the ETF’s shares dipping below $75 by mid-July, which at over 90,0000 contracts represents the biggest block of open interest in the ETF’s near-term options. The ETF’s shares were up 41 cents at $78 on Friday. There are another 82,0000 put contracts open at the $69 and $74 strike prices and these expire in September. “The (ETF’s) shares are up about 8 percent this year and with July earnings around the corner, and big names set to report results, it looks like investors might have been picking up some protection,” Elisha said. The ETF touched an all-time high of $78.30 on Wednesday, and the low cost of buying downside protection might be the driving factor behind the increased hedging activity, suggested Susquehanna derivatives strategist Christopher Jacobson.  For example, the cost of 3-month 10 percent out-of-the-money XLY puts is now cheaper than it has been 95 percent of the time over the last five years, he said.  The appetite for cheap protection is understandable given that a lot of active managers are overweight the sector, strategists said. Investors taking a longer-term view might also be concerned about the impact from the looming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike. “The sector typically under-performs when the Fed raises rates,” said Jill Carey Hall, equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who is underweight the consumer discretionary sector. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade in September. “Investors could just be starting to pay more attention to that,” Hall said. The threat of higher wages putting pressure on margins might also be on investor’s minds. A number of big retailers and national chains, including McDonald’s - one of the top five constituents of the ETF - have been raising wages of late. “Given that the sector is labor intensive there could be concerns about this hurting margins,” Hall said. Recent corporate results, however, at two of the ETF’s top ten constituents, - Walt Disney Co’s and Nike Inc - have been strong, helped by increased consumer spending, and bode well for quarterly results from McDonald’s, Amazon.com Inc and Starbucks Corp, due in July.

949,DIS,"Disney seeks continued tax exemption from Anaheim, California","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The “happiest place on Earth” will keep a special tax exemption in Anaheim, California, for 30 more years if the City Council approves the Walt Disney Co’s plan for a $1 billion-plus expansion of its theme park complex in the city. The five-member council is expected to vote on Tuesday on the company’s proposal to go ahead with its Disneyland Resort makeover in exchange for a continued waiver of any future admission tax the city might impose on entertainment venues. The resort’s current exemption was granted by the city in 1996 and is due to expire on June 30, 2016. No entertainment gate tax has ever been levied by the city of Anaheim, but an extension of Disney’s special waiver would reimburse the company for any such taxes imposed during the next three decades, municipal spokeswoman Ruth Ruiz said. Disney and its supporters say the exemption is merited because of the huge economic benefit Anaheim derives from the resort, which is the largest employer in the city and Orange County as a whole, accounting for 28,000 local jobs. “Anaheim has been an economic success story thanks to its policies and initiatives that allow businesses to invest and thrive,” Disneyland Resort President Michael Colglazier said in a statement. But Mayor Tom Tait, a City Council member who backed the original tax exemption, has gone on record opposing the plan to renew it, citing an estimated $500 million in unfunded pension obligations now faced by the city. “Chaining the hands of future residents on their ability to impose taxes will jeopardize the city’s financial health,” he was quoted as saying in the Orange County Register. Two other council members support an extension, while two others have said they are undecided. Disney’s plan calls for breaking ground by the end of 2017 and finishing construction by 2024. A study commissioned by Disney projected the project would support an average of 2,600 local jobs a year, and lead to creation of 2,100 permanent jobs.     The company has not specified whether Disneyland itself or the adjacent Disney California Adventure park, or both, would be enlarged, or what new attractions might be added.

The $5.5 billion theme park, being developed with China’s state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group, will transport visitors to six themed “worlds” and offer other attractions based on “Star Wars” and the Marvel Comics’ superheroes, including “Iron Man”, “Spider-Man” and the “Hulk”. Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of the iconic U.S. entertainment firm, told a news conference in Shanghai on Wednesday that the park would be “authentically Disney and distinctively Chinese”. The park will “not only showcase the best of Disney’s story telling but also celebrates and incorporates China’s incredibly rich heritage,” Iger said at an ceremony in Shanghai, where the firm unveiled a miniature-sized model of the park. Visitors will be able to pass along “Mickey Avenue”, float through “Adventure Isle”, “Fantasyland” and “Treasure Cove”, before taking off for “Tomorrowland”. Disney, which opened its largest ever store in Shanghai in May, will be hoping it can tap into growth in the world’s second largest economy, despite China’s recent slowdown. Disney earlier this year delayed the opening of Shanghai Disneyland until the first half of 2016 from a scheduled start at the end of 2015 as it expanded plans for the park.  The park is now scheduled to have a grand opening in spring next year. The firm’s park and resorts segment brought in $15.1 billion globally last year, around a third of its total revenues. Disney is also tapping into China’s film market, with the latest outing of its “Avengers” series taking the number two spot in country’s 20.4 billion yuan box office for the first half of the year.

959,DIS,UPDATE 3-Disney shares drop after company lowers cable outlook,"(Recasts with share drop, lowered guidance) By Lisa Richwine and Arathy S Nair Aug 4 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co lowered profit guidance for its cable networks unit and reported quarterly revenue slightly below Wall Street forecasts, sending its shares down 6 percent on Tuesday. The media company now expects annual operating income growth at the unit in the mid-single digits for fiscal years 2013 to 2016, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on a conference call. It previously had forecast growth in the high single digits. The company cut its forecast because it expects lower revenue from a decline in subscribers and the impact of foreign exchange rates, McCarthy said. Sports network ESPN has experienced “modest” subscriber losses as viewing habits have shifted to digital platforms, Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said. Walt Disney shares dropped 6 percent to $114.10 in after-hours trading. The reduced guidance and revenue miss likely sparked the decline, said Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich. “That’s where some of the concern lies,” Diedrich said of the cable outlook. Overall, the company produced “a good solid quarter.” Disney posted record profit in the June quarter, but its revenue missed Wall Street expectations for the first time in two years. It had net income of $2.48 billion, up 11 percent from a year earlier, and revenue of $13.1 billion, just shy of the $13.23 billion projected by industry analysts. The weaker euro cut revenue at the Disneyland Paris theme park by about $100 million, McCarthy said. Operating profit at theme parks rose 9 percent to $922 billion in the third quarter as attendance and spending rose at U.S. parks. Operating income at media networks rose 4 percent to $2.38 billion in the quarter as cable channels brought in higher fees from distributors. The media networks segment includes ESPN, the Disney Channels and the ABC broadcast network. Iger said he has “enormous confidence in ESPN’s future no matter how technology disrupts the media business.” Disney’s movie studio recorded a profit of $472 million, up from $411 million a year earlier, helped by the success of “Avengers: Age of Ultron”. The company’s overall net income climbed to $2.48 billion, or $1.45 per share, from $2.25 billion, or $1.28 per share last year. Revenue rose to $13.10 billion from $12.47 billion. Analysts on average expected a profit of $1.42 per share on revenue of $13.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Disney’s shares had risen 29 percent this year, making it the best performer among the 30-member Dow Jones industrial average.

The iPhone maker’s shares fell 3.21 percent to $114.64, firmly below their 200-day daily moving average, a key technical level closely watched by traders. The stock was the biggest drag on the three major U.S. indexes. A slowdown in China and skepticism over demand for iPhones were contributing to pressure on Apple’s shares, traders said. “Apple has been the weak sister in the market today,” said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist and director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, Georgia. “But if you look at the sectors, most everything is down with the exception of materials.” Stocks extended losses after Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart told the Wall Street Journal that September may be the right time for Fed to lift interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.27 percent to end at 17,550.69 and the S&P; 500 lost 0.22 percent to 2,093.32. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.19 percent finish at 5,105.55. Eight of the 10 major S&P; sectors fell, with the utilities index’s 1.64 percent decline leading the losers. The Fed has said it needs to see a sustained economic recovery before it raises interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Soft economic data had prompted some investors to argue that the Fed might hold off on raising rates until December. After the Fed meeting last week, investors expected a rate increase in September. “The market is getting such a mixed bag of rhetoric from the Fed, it seems like the Fed isn’t sure what it’s going to do,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. After the bell, shares of crafts website Etsy fell 9 percent and Walt Disney lost 1.4 percent after the companies posted quarterly results that disappointed Wall Street. First Solar posted better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance and its stock was up 10 percent. During the session, American International Group  fell 2.82 percent after the insurer’s underwriting income fell in almost all of its units, while home and auto insurer Allstate  fell 10.15 percent after its profit missed expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1.23 to 1. On the Nasdaq, 1,414 issues fell and 1,376 advanced for a 1.03-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

969,DIS,ESPN customer losses show even sports vulnerable as TV shifts,"LOS ANGELES, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co has acknowledged that even powerhouse network ESPN and its live sports programming are not insulated from the massive changes shaking up the television landscape, confirming warnings from skeptics. The entertainment giant’s frank admission raised questions about whether the pace of “cord cutting,” or dropping of pay TV service, will hasten. “There has been this enormous run with ESPN without any speed bumps of any kind over the last decade,” said Marc Ganis, president of SportsCorp, a sports business consulting firm. “Now there is a disruption in the flight path.” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said on Tuesday that ESPN has seen “modest” declines in subscribers as viewers move to cheaper digital platforms. He would not be more specific but he defended the network’s ability to navigate the shifts. It did not convince some investors as Disney shares dropped 9.2 percent to $110.53 on Wednesday after the company warned that subscriber losses as well as currency impacts will hit profits. Some Wall Street analysts are also concerned about ESPN’s rising costs for sports rights as pay TV comes under pressure from new players. In a note to clients, Nomura Securities International said, “ESPN and cable ecosystem-related fears may become marginally greater concerns in the minds of investors, this despite the power of the ESPN brand and, what we believe to be its ability to benefit from new online and direct-to-consumer monetization potential.” Disney executives are realists about the impact of technology and changing viewing habits, particularly among younger audiences, Iger said. But he said he expected the expanded basic cable package with ESPN and hundreds of other channels to “remain the dominant package of choice for some years to come.” Iger said he does not plan to take any radical steps in the near term to sell ESPN online. He also stressed that live viewing on ESPN remains strong. On TV, 83 percent of households tuned in to ESPN at some point during the first quarter of the year. ESPN has rights to major sporting events locked up for years. Live sports are one of the few types of programming that still draw massive audiences at one time, making them valuable to advertisers. And for many customers, sports is the reason they keep their pay TV subscriptions. “All this adds up to a very strong hand and gives us enormous confidence in ESPN’s future no matter how technology disrupts the media business,” Iger said. Some analysts agreed. “Their claim on audiences that advertisers want to get in front of - people that watch big, live sporting events - is very strong,” said Barton Crockett, analyst at FBR Capital Markets. Iger, speaking on the company’s quarterly conference call, said 80 percent of ESPN’s customer losses came from a reduction in the number of households that subscribe to pay TV, and only a small percentage from customers taking slimmer channel bundles. SNL Kagan estimates ESPN will average 94.6 million subscribers this year, down from 98.8 million in 2012. Iger said Disney’s contracts provide flexibility to sell channels directly to consumers if the marketplace changes. The company is testing new approaches, such as putting ESPN on Dish Network Corp’s $20-a-month Sling TV package. Ganis, who believes ESPN is well-positioned to weather the industry’s shifts, applauded the company for looking for ways to adapt. “It’s better to be focused on it now when it’s just a million or so before it becomes a much larger number,” he said.

971,DIS,RPT-WRAPUP 2-U.S. cable TV companies' shares crushed after Disney disappoints,"(Repeats to fix formatting) By Lisa Richwine and Bill Rigby Aug 5 (Reuters) - Nagging investor concerns over viewers cutting the cord on cable television and moving online turned into a rout in the sector’s shares on Wednesday after Walt Disney Co reported a dip in subscribers for its cornerstone sports channel ESPN and rivals produced a mixed batch of earnings. ESPN, which is available only as part of broad cable TV packages, has been seen as a savior of the bundling business model with its line-up of live sports and highlight reels.

ESPN, which is available only as part of broad cable TV packages, has been seen as a savior of the bundling business model with its line-up of live sports and highlight reels.

Gains in major tech companies Google, Facebook  and Apple led the advance on the Nasdaq. The S&P; 500 tech sector gained 1.2 percent, its best performance in three weeks. Earnings in the technology sector of the S&P; 500 are expected to have grown 5.3 percent in the second quarter, up from a 2.1 percent increase expected back on July 1, according to the most recent Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. “There’s been a sector rotation into technology because of the improvement in their earnings expectations,” said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. He said , however, the market’s move is “a modest bounce back after discernable pressure over the last trading sessions.” He cited deceleration in the Chinese economy as an ongoing headwind for stocks, specifically commodities-related sectors. Disney’s shares fell to $110.33, a 9.3 percent drop and the largest for any day since Dec. 1, 2008, after it cut its profit forecast for its cable networks unit, spooking the entire industry. Shares of Comcast fell 4.7 percent, Discovery Communications lost 13.2 percent and Twenty-First Century Fox fell 7.1 percent. Disney’s shares are still up 17xx percent year to date, compared with a gain of x percent on the S&P; 500. “Disney has had such a tremendous move in the past months that a setback within the stock price should not be a surprise,” said Morganlander. At 3:36 p.m. EDT (1936 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 2.78 points, or 0.02 percent, to 17,553.47, the S&P; 500 had gained 7.78 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,101.1 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 38.25 points, or 0.75 percent, to 5,143.79. U.S. private job growth slowed in July but a surge in services industry activity to a near-decade high suggested solid economic momentum that strengthens the case for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year.

976,DIS,UPDATE 4-Time Warner falls as Disney's cable warning spooks sector,"* Disney cut cable unit’s profit forecast on Tuesday * Comments overshadow Time Warner’s strong results * Time Warner shares fall as much as 9 pct   (Updates shares) By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Arathy S Nair Aug 5 (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc’s shares fell as much as 9 percent after Walt Disney Co alarmed investors with a dour outlook for its cable business, suggesting that more people were switching to video-streaming from paid TV than previously expected. Disney’s comments overshadowed Time Warner’s strong quarterly results, which were boosted by a deal with video-streaming service Hulu and the release of “Batman: Arkham Knight” and “Mortal Kombat X” videogames. “On any other day, this report would likely be warmly received and a positive driver for the stock,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger wrote in a note. “But today is not just any day. Today is the day after Disney spooked the sector with their comments that cord-cutting is worse than they thought.” Disney cut its profit forecast for its cable networks unit on Tuesday, citing a decline in subscribers. The company’s shares fell about 10 percent on Wednesday. Time Warner and Disney are remodeling their businesses to grab a larger share of the video-streaming market as consumers increasingly take to watching television shows online, a trend dubbed as “cord cutting”. In April, Time Warner’s Turner division, owner of channels such as CNN and TNT, granted exclusive subscription video-on-demand rights for its programs from Cartoon Network and Adult Swim to Hulu. Time Warner also launched its own standalone streaming service, HBO Now, in the same month. Less than 1 percent of HBO’s cable subscribers had switched to HBO Now, HBO CEO Richard Plepler said on a post-earnings conference call. Time Warner’s revenue rose 8 percent to $7.35 billion, helped by its Turner division and Warner Bros. studio, which together make up more than 80 percent of the total revenue. The rest comes from Time Warner’s HBO network, which airs the hit medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones”. Excluding items, the company earned $1.25 per share, well above the $1.03 analysts had expected. Time Warner’s shares were down 7.5 percent at $81.07 in afternoon trading. Up to Tuesday’s close, the stock had risen about 3 percent this year, compared with a 10 percent rise in the S&P; 500 Movies & Entertainment index.

978,DIS,"Despite media stock beat down, Disney stands tall with U.S. funds","(Reuters) - U.S. media stocks have taken an indiscriminate beating this week, but many big fund managers still like entertainment conglomerate Walt Disney Co while turning negative for the long term on Discovery Communications, owner of several niche television franchises. Shares of leading media stocks slid again on Thursday as investors sorted winners and losers. Television advertising has been drying up as consumers downsize or eliminate expensive cable TV packages and watch more programs on mobile devices.  The stock decline, fanned by a slew of disappointing financial reports, hurt a number of U.S. funds this week. Portfolio manager Don Yacktman has seen the performance of both his $11.2 billion Yacktman Fund and the $7.6 billion Yacktman Focused fund tumble into the 98th percentile of their Morningstar peers. Along with 7.7 million shares of Viacom Inc spread between those two funds, Yacktman owns about 30 million shares of Twenty-First Century Fox, down about 22 percent for the year. Viacom is off 22 percent this week and down nearly 45 percent over the past 12 months. Yacktman did not respond to a request for comment. Shares of Disney are off nearly 10 percent this week amid concerns that its leading sports channel franchise ESPN is losing subscribers. Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Iger admitted to “modest losses” during a conference call with analysts and investors this week. But he said cable packages are not dead and ESPN will still be the centerpiece of any offering. Pound for pound, the $866 million Fidelity Select Multimedia Portfolio has one of the biggest bets on Disney’s future, with 24 percent of its assets in the stock at the end of June, fund disclosures show.  As a result, the fund is down 4.2 percent this week, underperforming nearly all of its peers, according to Morningstar Inc. But thanks in part to Disney, the fund’s three-year average annual total return of 21.76 percent is better than 83 percent of peers.  Portfolio manager Nidhi Gupta was not available for comment, but earlier this year declared Disney the “clear winner among the content providers.”  Like many other fund managers, Gupta has soured on Discovery Communications, hard hit by the consumer shift to watching Internet-based content. Discovery shares are down 7 percent this week and down 29 percent over the past 12 months. Fund managers began unloading large blocks of Discovery early last year. Fidelity’s behemoth Contrafund had a $1 billion stake in Discovery in early 2014. By the end of the year, Will Danoff, manager of the $113 billion fund, had eliminated his position in Discovery, citing disappointing earnings.  By contrast, Danoff’s stake in Disney, $2.6 billion at the end of June, has grown to about 2.3 percent of Contrafund’s portfolio, up from 1.87 percent in early 2014, fund disclosures show.

The selloff was compounded by nervousness ahead of key jobs data on Friday that could provide clues about the timing of the first Federal Reserve interest rate hike in almost a decade.

The S&P; 500 media index lost 2.12 percent and notched its biggest two-day fall since November 2008, with Time Warner, Comcast and CBS all in the red and Twenty-First Century Fox down 6.4 percent. “All the media stocks are down and it seems people just want to get out of the sector at any cost and take any loss,” CLSA analyst Vasily Karasyov said. Viacom’s results and Disney’s warning put the spotlight on a trend of viewers shifting from cable TV to Internet-based services such as Netflix, which rose 2.21 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.69 percent to end at 17,419.75 and the S&P; 500 lost 0.78 percent to 2,083.56. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.62 percent to 5,056.44, its biggest one-day tumble since early July. Eight of the 10 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the health index’s 2.09 percent fall leading the decliners. Allergan fell 5.1 percent after the Irish drugmaker reported a second-quarter loss. In other earnings-driven stock moves, Tesla fell 8.88 percent and Keurig Green Mountain slumped as much as 29.75 percent after reporting disappointing numbers. Investors were also jittery ahead of the release of U.S. non-farm payroll numbers, which are expected to have risen by 223,000 in July, matching gains in June.

Economic data released in the last few days have been largely mixed, prompting some investors to argue that the Fed might hold off a rate hike until December.

983,DIS,Disney warning eclipses AMC Networks' sales rise,"(Reuters) - AMC Networks Inc’s (AMCX.O) shares fell as much as 14 percent despite the company’s strong results, continuing a slide triggered by Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) forecast that suggested that more customers were deserting paid TV than expected.  Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) alarmed investors with a dour outlook for its cable business on Wednesday, overshadowing Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) strong quarterly results and triggering a selloff across media stocks. “...After Disney all the media stocks are down and it seems like people just want to get out of the sector at any cost and take any loss,” CLSA analyst Vasily Karasyov said. “Their selling pressure is relentless,” he added. Vasily, who said AMC Network’s metrics were strong, called the selloff a “liquidation trade”. Discovery Communications Inc (DISCA.O), Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) and CBS Corp (CBS.N) were all down.  AMC Networks’ quarterly revenue and profit handily beat market estimates on Thursday, mainly due to the stake it bought in BBC America in October. The company paid $200 million for a 49.9 percent stake in BBC America and took operational control of the cable TV channel that reaches 80 million U.S. homes and airs popular drama series such as “Doctor Who” and “Orphan Black.”  AMC Networks said revenue in its national networks unit, which includes BBC America, rose 22.7 percent to $488.6 million, helped by growth in both distribution and advertising revenue. Its new sci-fi show “Humans” was launched in the quarter and a companion series to its hit show “The Walking Dead” titled “Fear of the walking dead” is slated for launch in August. Another original program “Into the Badlands” is slated for a November premier. Net income attributable to AMC Networks shareholders rose to $83.0 million, or $1.14 per share, in the quarter, from $58.7 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 15.1 percent to $601.1 million. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 88 cents per share and revenue of $588.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from AMC’s international business, however, dropped 9.4 percent to $112.9 million. AMC shares were down 9.5 percent at $71.02 on Thursday afternoon. They closed down 9 percent on Wednesday.

Walt Disney’s shares fell 4.2 percent to $105.90, a day after their largest daily drop in almost seven years. The stock was also the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P; 500. Disney lowered profit guidance for its cable networks unit on Tuesday, while Viacom Inc reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue hurt by weakness in its cable TV business. Viacom fell 22 percent to $39.57, their lowest in almost four years. Twenty-First Century Fox fell 12.3 percent, while Time Warner, Comcast and CBS  were all in the red. In other earnings-driven stock moves, Tesla and Keurig Green Mountain skidded after reporting disappointing numbers. Michael Kors was among the few bright spots on a gloomy day, rising 12.1 percent to $44.25 after its results beat expectations. Even as earnings directed Wall Street’s moves on Thursday, investors were jittery ahead of non-farm payroll numbers that are expected to have risen by 223,000 in July - on par with June. Economic data released in the last few days have been largely mixed, prompting some investors to argue that the Fed might hold off a rate hike until December. The Fed has said it will raise rates only when it sees a sustained recovery in the economy. A hike in rates, which have stayed near zero for nearly a decade, will increase borrowing costs for companies, crimping profits. “While September looks likely, it’s the pace of the tightening that’s more important rather than the timing of the hike,” said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York. At 11:42 a.m. ET (1542 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 122.7 points, or 0.7 percent, at 17,417.77, the S&P; 500 was down 18.03 points, or 0.86 percent, at 2,081.81 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 86.27 points, or 1.68 percent, at 5,053.68. Nine of the 10 major S&P; sectors were lower with the consumer discretionary index’s 2.13 percent fall leading the decliners. The index includes media stocks. In more earnings action, Marathon Oil, Monster Beverage and Zynga report after the close of market. With about three-quarters of the S&P; 500 companies having reported, second-quarter earnings are estimated to have increased 1.3 percent while revenues are projected to have  fallen 3.5 percent. However, valuations look stretched. The S&P; 500 is trading at a 25 percent premium to its historical median price-to-sales ratio, Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank said in a note to clients. “The Federal Reserve will soon withdraw its unwavering liquidity, leaving the bulls to rely on technical indicators such the 200 day moving average, above which the S&P; 500 is trading.” Tesla Motors fell 9.4 percent to $244.61 after the electric car maker posted a wider quarterly loss. Keurig Green Mountain slumped as much as 30.1 percent to a two-year low of $52.40, a day after the company lowered its annual sales and earnings-per-share forecasts. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,022 to 913. On the Nasdaq, 1,891 issues fell and 769 advanced.

Walt Disney’s shares fell 2.9 percent to $107.33, a day after their largest daily drop in almost seven years. The stock was also the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P; 500.

The Fed has said it will raise rates only when it sees a sustained recovery in the economy. A hike in rates, which have stayed near zero for nearly a decade, will increase borrowing costs for companies, crimping profits. “I’ve been leaning towards September because while the data has been mixed, none of it has been really bad,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “I think a hike is good for the market because we can finally stop worrying about it, and historically the Fed has always been slow regarding subsequent increases.” Data released on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week, indicating tighter labor market conditions. At 9:53 a.m. ET (1353 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 69.58 points, or 0.4 percent, at 17,470.89, the S&P; 500 was down 4.99 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,094.85 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 16.67 points, or 0.32 percent, at 5,123.27.

987,DIS,European Factors to Watch-Equity futures slip lower,"(Adds company news item) LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - European equity futures fell on Thursday, with media shares expected to come in the spotlight after an overnight fall in the shares of Disney after Disney cut profit forecasts for its cable networks unit. The euro zone’s blue chip Euro STOXX 50 futures fell 0.5 percent. Germany’s DAX futures also declined 0.5 percent, France’s CAC futures  fell 0.5 percent while Britain’s FTSE 100 futures fell 0.5 percent. Many investors will also be on the lookout for further signs of possible interest rate rises coming soon in the United States and Britain. The Bank of England is likely to say on Thursday that its policymakers have split over interest rates, adding to expectations it is heading for its first increase in borrowing costs in nearly a decade. Some better-than-expected U.S. economic data this week has also backed views that the U.S. will raise rates in September. The prospect of rising rates can often cause stocks to fall, as higher rates boost returns on cash and bonds, and can lead to bigger interest bills for companies listed on the stock market. European stock markets had risen on Wednesday, buoyed by solid corporate results from the likes of French bank Societe Generale. Deutsche Telekom and Belgian financial group KBC both reported higher profits on Thursday, although Deutsche Post cut its profit target. According to data from Thomson Reuters StarMine, 59 percent of companies on the European STOXX 600 index have beaten or met market expectations with results this quarter.  ———————————————————————————————————————    > GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia shares drop, dollar firm; U.S. data signals Sept hike     > US STOCKS-Tech leads Nasdaq, S&P; 500; Disney sparks media selloff    > Nikkei gains on a weaker yen, earnings forecasts divide fortunes    > TREASURIES-Longer-dated yields rise on Fed rate hike skepticism    > FOREX-Dollar edges down but close to highs, sterling awaits BOE update    > PRECIOUS-Gold stuck near 2010 low as data backs Sept Fed hike view    > METALS-London copper up on China data, aluminium recovers from 6-yr low     > Oil hovers near multi-month lows, Brent below $50 German sportswear company Adidas has engaged an investment bank to consider options for its golf business, which is struggling as the sport loses popularity, particularly in the United States, its biggest market, it said on Thursday. France’s national basket ball league said businessman Patrick Drahi’s holding company had agreed to pay 50 million euros for five seasons of TV rights to the French championship. British insurer Aviva on Thursday posted forecast-beating half-year operating profit, boosted by higher premiums in general insurance and the ahead of schedule integration of recent purchase Friends Life. Deutsche Bank has fired two senior trading executives, the Wall Street Journal reported. German postal and logistics company Deutsche Post cut its 2015 profit target on Thursday after taking a 100 million euro ($109 million) hit due to a series of strikes over its plans to expand its parcel division using workers on lower pay. Deutsche Telekom reported a 13.5 percent rise in quarterly core profit helped by its U.S. operations. Fugro, the Dutch surveying company, on Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings for the first half of 2015, as it cut costs and sold operations in expectation of an extended downturn in the oil industry. Belgian financial group KBC said on Thursday its net profit doubled in the second quarter compared with the same period last year, as both loans and deposits grew in its core markets. German steel distributor Kloeckner & Co said it would accelerate its restructuring programme and abandoned its goal of increasing 2015 core profit after a sharp drop in global steel prices wiped more than a third off its second-quarter earnings. German retailer Metro AG has bought Singapore-based restaurant supplier Classic Fine Foods Group from private equity group EQT for $290 million, it said on Thursday as it reported a slowdown in same-store sales due to a shift in Easter. Denmark’s Novo Nordisk’s lifted its profit outlook in local currency terms for 2015, after a strong second quarter in which its key diabetes drug Victoza sold more than expected, offsetting price pressure in the United States. Miner Rio Tinto posted lower first-half earnings. Zurich Insurance Group will not overpay in any bid for Britain’s RSA it said as it posted an unexpected drop in second-quarter net profit.

The new 14-acre “Star Wars” land, the largest themed land to be part of Anaheim, California’s Disneyland and Orlando, Florida’s Disney World, will introduce a new planet from George Lucas’ intergalactic film saga. It will also feature two new rides, including one where participants will be able to take control of the Millennium Falcon spaceship, as well as the Cantina, the infamous hub of rogue smugglers and traders in the films.

The new lands will hope to harness the avid fanbase of “Star Wars,” which first came out in 1977 and has since become embedded into U.S. pop culture. The announcement, made by Disney Chief Executive and Chairman Bob Iger at the annual D23 Exposition in Anaheim on Saturday, comes as fans gear up for the first installment of a new trilogy of “Star Wars” films, kicking off with December’s “The Force Awakens.” Harrison Ford, who reprises the role of Han Solo, was welcomed to the convention stage with a standing ovation and led the cast of the new film, including Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o and British newcomer John Boyega. “It’s a great thing to be here with you, who made this whole thing happen.

The toys will be introduced online over an 18-hour period in 15 cities and 12 nations beginning in Sydney, Australia early on Sept. 3, movie studio Walt Disney said. Selections of the new toys, as well as comics, books and clothing, will then go on sale in stores around the world, with many opening at midnight. Book stores in many nations held midnight parties for fans eager to get their hands on the new books during the “Harry Potter” publishing phenomenon of the early 2000’s.  The toy roll-out is part of a huge merchandising effort by Disney ahead of the December release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” - the first in a new “Star Wars” trilogy - which brings back some of the beloved cast from the original 1977 movie, including Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. “The Force Awakens,” picks up 30 years after “Episode VI: Return of the Jedi” and is the most hotly-anticipated movie release of the year. Disney earlier this month announced partnerships with seven global brands, including cereal maker General Mills, automaker Fiat Chrysler, and make-up line Covergirl. Japan’s biggest airline, ANA, has also announced that three of its planes will be decorated with “Star Wars” characters and that they will offer all six of the current “Star Wars” movies as part of their in-flight entertainment.

999,DIS,"ESPN, CBS Radio to promote podcasts at industry ad event","Aug 27 (Reuters) - CBS Radio and Walt Disney’s  ESPN are joining a handful of companies that will promote podcasts to advertisers at the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s first podcast upfronts next month, executives told Reuters. As consumers increasingly use mobile devices for content,  media companies are turning to podcasts for potential revenue with advertisers often paying a premium for them. Podcasts are a small, but growing part of the digital media marketplace with a wealthy, tech-savvy group of listeners, said Larry Rosin, president of Edison Research, a Somerville, New Jersey-based market research firm that serves media companies. “They are more likely to have the tools and toys that make downloading podcasts easier,” Rosin said. While media companies and investors are concerned about viewers turning away from traditional television, 17 percent of teens and adults listened to at least one podcast per month, up from 15 percent last year, according to Edison Research. Television broadcasters developed upfronts or a group of meetings to promote new shows and lock in commitments from advertisers, and over the past few years IAB developed the “Newfronts,” which are upfronts for the digital video industry. Now IAB is testing out if there is a market for podcast upfronts, said IAB Vice President Carl Kalapesi. Many of the most popular podcasts, such as the recent “Serial” series are from non-profits, but commercial podcasts are growing. CBS Corp’s local digital media unit this year launched original content podcasts including pro wrestling talk show “WOOOOO! Nation” in a new division, play.it. Its audience rose 30 percent since January and revenue is up double digits, said division president Ezra Kucharz. ESPN is seeing digital and traditional radio growth, said     Traug Keller, ESPN senior vice president of production business divisions. This comes at a time when ESPN is seeing a decline in television subscribers, a move which has unnerved many media investors.. More broadly, while traditional broadcast radio revenue overall is declining, digital radio ad spending is expected to be $2.75 billion this year, up almost 28 percent from 2014, eMarketer forecasts. Podcasts make up small double-digit millions of that figure, estimates eMarketer analyst Paul Verna. “It’s a blip on the radar... but its becoming a bigger blip,” he said. On average, the cost that an advertiser pays for a thousand impressions, known as the CPM, of a podcast is $15 to $30, according to Midroll Media, which connects podcast shows with advertisers. Meanwhile, the average CPM for radio is in the mid-single digits, according to analysts. ESPN and CBS join NPR, WNYC, Panoply, Podtrac, AdLarge and Midroll as presenters for the IAB upfronts which will take place on Sept. 10 in New York.

1009,DIS,How to find a Disney cruise for less,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney cruises can be expensive, but you do not have to choose between sailing with Mickey and sending your children to college someday. Necessarily. During peak summer and winter holiday seasons, Disney’s least expensive inside staterooms can cost more than $1,000 a night for a family of four. At other times though, even desirable cabins with verandahs can be booked for less than half that amount. The $6,000 fare our family recently paid for a seven-night Caribbean cruise in late August did not feel like a steal. But the same itinerary cost twice as much for a Dec. 19 sailing. Actually, fares for the holiday cruise range from $9,700 for an inside stateroom to $31,000 for a one-bedroom concierge suite. To get a good deal on Disney Cruise Line, it helps to understand the Walt Disney Co unit's unique position in the marketplace that keeps prices high, said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor in chief of Cruise Critic (cruisecritic.com/), a review and travel information site. While marketing heavily to families, Disney proffers a luxury experience that includes high-end, adults-only restaurants, more spacious cabins and décor that is upscale, even with all the hidden mouse ears.  Disney is a much smaller player than market-dominating cruise companies such as Carnival Corp or Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and has added capacity slowly to avoid the fire sales other lines use to move unsold cabins, Brown said. “Disney is very conservative, very careful,” Brown said.  That means the usual bargain-hunting strategy of booking at the last minute often will not work. In fact, fares typically rise over time as the ships fill, said Adrienne Vincent-Phoenix, CEO of vacation resource site MousePlanet (mouseplanet.com) and a veteran of 20 Disney cruises.  Rather than discounting fares for poorly selling cruises, Disney tends to offer “kids sail free” promotions or other add-ons, she said. Savvy buyers are already snapping up the least expensive and most desirable cabins for next summer, Brown said. For high-season travel, “you need to plan at least a year in advance,” she said. Instead, bargain hunters should consider traveling during the school year, when most families cannot. They should also seek out longer trips, especially cruises across the Atlantic or through the Panama Canal which the company uses to reposition its ships. For example, a 14-night transatlantic cruise that sails May 15 from Port Canaveral, Florida currently can be booked for as little as $1,890 per person, or $270 a night for a couple.  Note that it is now industry standard to add gratuities directly to the bill, and Disney charges $12 per person per day to cover room stewards (called hosts and hostesses) and dining room servers. That added up to $336 for our party of four. Vincent-Phoenix also suggested looking for cruises out of less popular ports such as Galveston, Texas or Miami. Several sites, including Cruise Critic and Mousesavers (mousesavers.com/), highlight Disney Cruise fares. Vincent-Phoenix recommended first-time cruisers use a travel agent to help sift through the possibilities and wrestle with logistics. She suggested looking for agencies with “Earmark” or “Authorized Disney Vacation Planner” designations, who have special training and understand the cruise line’s historical pricing patterns.  Booking through a travel agent typically costs no more than booking directly with Disney, and many agencies offer incentives such as shipboard credits of a few hundred dollars to book through them.  Those credits come in handy, because cruise ships offer plenty of ways to spend money on top of fares. While Disney ships do not have casinos, they do have spas with costly treatments, and therapists who push expensive products. Disney-sponsored excursions, souvenirs and professional photography packages can inflate the bill, as can the aforementioned adults-only restaurants, which charge additional amounts ranging from $35 to $85 per person. In some cases, the add-ons are worth it. We had amazing meals at the restaurants on our ship, and the week-long pass to the spa felt like a good investment at about $100 each.  On the other hand, we found most of the excursions overpriced. We booked a good all-day snorkel trip at St. Martin via TripAdvisor.com for much less than Disney charged. At Castaway Cay, Disney’s private island in the Bahamas, excursions are quite unnecessary. There is plenty to do for free.

1010,DIS,CORRECTED-COLUMN-How to find a Disney cruise for less,"(In paragraph 6, corrects Carolyn Spencer Brown’s title to editor in chief, not CEO) By Liz Weston LOS ANGELES, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Disney cruises can be expensive, but you do not have to choose between sailing with Mickey and sending your children to college someday. Necessarily. During peak summer and winter holiday seasons, Disney’s least expensive inside staterooms can cost more than $1,000 a night for a family of four. At other times though, even desirable cabins with verandahs can be booked for less than half that amount. The $6,000 fare our family recently paid for a seven-night Caribbean cruise in late August did not feel like a steal. But the same itinerary cost twice as much for a Dec. 19 sailing. Actually, fares for the holiday cruise range from $9,700 for an inside stateroom to $31,000 for a one-bedroom concierge suite. To get a good deal on Disney Cruise Line, it helps to understand the Walt Disney Co unit's unique position in the marketplace that keeps prices high, said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor in chief of Cruise Critic (cruisecritic.com/),  a review and travel information site. While marketing heavily to families, Disney proffers a luxury experience that includes high-end, adults-only restaurants, more spacious cabins and décor that is upscale, even with all the hidden mouse ears. Disney is a much smaller player than market-dominating cruise companies such as Carnival Corp or Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and has added capacity slowly to avoid the fire sales other lines use to move unsold cabins, Brown said. “Disney is very conservative, very careful,” Brown said.

1011,DIS,Fitch Rates Disney's Notes Offering 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The  Walt Disney Company's (Disney) offering of benchmark-sized three-, five-, and  10-year senior unsecured notes.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. Approximately  $15.3 billion of debt was outstanding as of June 27, 2015 including $2.4 billion  of commercial paper (CP). A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Disney's operating profile positions the company to generate free cash flow  (FCF) in excess of $4 billion annually, which coupled with strong liquidity and  solid credit metrics, provides the company with considerable financial  flexibility at the current ratings.  Fitch expects the company to concurrently  deploy cash for share repurchase and moderate M&A; activity. --The ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation that the company's share  repurchase and M&A; activity will likely exceed FCF generation.  --Disney is uniquely positioned, relative to its peers, to capitalize and  monetize its internally or externally developed franchises and brands across the  company's various business segments and platforms, which in turn strengthens the  company's operating and credit profile and provides Disney with a sustainable  competitive advantage.  --Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks, ESPN in particular, underlines  the company's ratings. Disney's operating profile benefits from the stable,  recurring, dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation  characteristics attributable to its cable network business. Fitch expects this  segment will continue to generate a significant amount of Disney's cash flow. --Disney's strong asset portfolio positions the company to address the secular  threats and opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution  platforms and continued audience fragmentation across the media and  entertainment landscape.  The ratings reflect the company's leading market positions within its core  businesses. Further, Disney has a very consistent investment strategy that is  centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and content that is  leverageable across its various platforms (cable and broadcast network, studio,  parks and resorts, and consumer products).  Disney's operating profile positions the company to generate meaningful levels  of FCF (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and  dividends), providing the company with considerable financial flexibility at the  current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resort segment  is expected to increase capital spending to approximately $4.8 billion during  fiscal 2015 ($4.4 billion net of Shanghai Disney Resort partner contributions),  which will temporarily hamper FCF generation during fiscal 2015.  Fitch  anticipates that Disney will generate in excess of $4 billion of annual FCF  during the ratings horizon.  Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial policy  over the ratings horizon.  We believe Disney maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of its business. Fitch expects  that Disney will manage the level of share repurchase activity in a manner  consistent with its current ratings and acknowledges that the company's share  repurchases and M&A; activity will likely exceed FCF generation.  Disney  repurchased approximately 29 million shares of its common stock for $2.8 billion  during the nine-month period ended June 27, 2015.  As of that date the company  had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 386 million additional  shares.       Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain consistent and  within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated leverage of 1x  as of the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended June 27, 2015 is in line with  fiscal year-end 2014 metrics. Going forward, Fitch believes leverage will range  between 1x and 1.4x during the ratings horizon after consideration for a modest  increase in debt levels related to the higher level of share repurchases.  Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks underlines the company's ratings,  and its operating profile continues to benefit from the stable, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile and high operating margin characteristics  attributable to its cable network business. Fitch believes there is sufficient  flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate slower affiliate fee  revenue and operating income growth within this business.  Disney's cable  networks generate the largest portion of total revenue and EBITDA, resulting in  incremental stability in the total revenue and FCF profile. Secular issues such  as the stagnant multi-channel video subscriber base and its effect on affiliate  fee revenue, rising programming costs, particularly sports programming, the  impact of foreign exchange, and Disney's ability to pass the higher costs on to  multi-channel video programming distributors (MPVDs) will remain a significant  risk to the company's operating profile. However, we believe that Disney is in a  strong position to retain pricing power going forward, as its collection of  top-tier cable networks continue to command audience and ratings and be a  must-carry for the MVPDs. In addition, Disney has, in large part, successfully  matched the tenor of its long-term sports programming rights with the terms of  its various affiliation agreements with the MVPDs.  Ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the company's businesses, particularly  Parks & Resorts (31% of Disney's revenue through the LTM June 27, 2015),  Consumer Products (9%), and the advertising portion of broadcast and cable  networks (16%). Should macroeconomic volatility return, Fitch expects these  cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure but that the company's credit  and financial profile will likely remain within expectations for the current  ratings.  Disney is well positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities  presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience  fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. The evolving media  landscape including the growing prominence of Internet-based and time shifted  television content will not have a material negative impact on Disney's credit  profile or FCF over the intermediate term. For example, approximately 71% of  ESPN's telecast hours are live and coveted by advertisers.  The live programming  blunts the effects of time-shifted viewing (96% of ESPN programming is viewed  live) and ad-skipping. Further, in Fitch's view, the proliferation of new  over-the-top entrants and methods of consumption will continue to drive more  demand for Disney's content. As to the uncertainty around the continued ability  of cable networks to pass increased programming costs on to the distributors, we  believe it poses moderate risk to cable network providers over the longer term.  Mitigants for Disney include Fitch's belief that the top-tier channels will  retain leverage with distributors going forward. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --The revenue growth within the company's cable networks business (Disney's  Media Networks segment) reflects the stability of the business and expected  affiliate fee increases.  Fitch anticipates high-single-digit affiliation  revenue growth.  --Programming expenses are expected to increase by high-single to  low-double-digits driven by sports rights costs.  --Fitch assumes typical volatility within the Studio Entertainment, Parks and  Resort, and Consumer Products operating segments.   --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes modest margin expansion  within the company's Media Networks segment as retransmission revenue gains  enhance broadcast margins while cable network margins remain stable reflecting  the company's ability to grow higher margin affiliate fee revenues at a similar  pace to increasing programming costs.  Disney's investments within its Parks and  Resort segment lead to higher margins within its domestic business.  Studio  Entertainment margins remain relatively consistent. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.  However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more  conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary  actions of Disney's management rather than by operating performance, reflecting  the company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase  leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will  likely lead to a negative rating action. LIQUIDITY Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and is  supported by significant FCF generation as well as $6 billion of aggregate  available borrowing capacity (as of June 27, 2015) under three credit  facilities. Commitments under these credit facilities support the company's $6  billion CP program and expire during March 2016 ($1.5 billion), June 2017 ($2.25  billion) and March 2019 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had  approximately $4.5 billion of cash on hand as of June 27, 2015. Scheduled  maturities are well laddered and manageable considering FCF generation  expectations and access to capital markets.  Disney does not have any debt scheduled to mature during the remainder of fiscal  2015.  Approximately $2 billion of debt is scheduled to mature during fiscal  2016 followed by $2.2 billion during fiscal 2017. Fitch does not expect debt  reduction going forward. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Disney as follows: The Walt Disney Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Total debt as of June 27, 2015 was approximately $15.3 billion and consisted of: --$2.4 billion of commercial paper (CP); --$11.9 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from December  2015 to 2093; --$253 million of debt related to Hong Kong Disneyland (as of FYE14), which is  non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption  that the company would back the loan payments;  --Approximately $530 million of foreign currency-denominated debt (as of FYE14),  including the debt related to the acquisition of UTV. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of  any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats  the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the  absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney  Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, we do  not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'  category-investment grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial  policies, and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney  Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if we viewed  there to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade  (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

1012,DIS,RPT-Fidelity's Danoff is face of key man risk as he hits 25-year mark,"(Repeats for additional subscribers) By David Randall NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - This fall, Boston-based fund giant Fidelity plans to celebrate the 25-year tenure of William Danoff, head of the biggest fund run by a single manager in the U.S. and arguably the best-performing large cap manager of his time. At a time when investors have been shifting tens of billions of dollars from active management to passively-managed funds, Danoff is one of the few mutual fund managers whose quarterly disclosures can move market prices. His Contrafund, with $106.3 billion in assets under management, is a mainstay of retirement savings plans nationwide. Yet some financial advisors and fund analysts say they are concerned that Fidelity has yet to name a co-manager for Contrafund, setting up the risk that investors will flee and remaining shareholders will suffer should Danoff, 55, retire or otherwise leave the fund suddenly. “There is a key man risk with Contrafund,” said Katie Rushkewicz Reichart, an analyst at Morningstar who covers the fund. “Not only has Danoff done quite well but he’s managing such a large sum of money that it’s not a role that another person could easily step into.” Those concerns are an echo of last September, when Bill Gross, who often referred to himself as the king of bonds, abruptly left Pimco and his management of the Total Return fund. To be sure, Gross had his worst performance in nearly two decades in the year before he left Pimco, and the fund had seen 16 straight months of outflows leading up to his departure. After his departure, Total Return suffered $18 billion in outflows in the first month alone, and another $107 billion between October 2014 and August 2015, according to Lipper data. Should Danoff leave, a sizeable rush to redeem shares could force Contrafund to unload some of its positions in companies such as Facebook, Apple, and Walt Disney  in which it is one of the largest shareholders, analysts said. Retirement plans, meanwhile, may be forced to remove the fund from among its investment options because the fund would no longer have the same management team in place for at least three years. Most advisors and institutional investors require at least a three-year track record with current management before investing, and the slate is wiped clean if the principal manager leaves without having three years or more with a co-manager, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P; Capital IQ. Fidelity did not make Danoff available for this article, but said concerns about succession planning are overblown. “Will is not going anywhere,” said Brian Hogan, the head of Fidelity’s equity division. “I can say that with a lot of confidence. I talk to Will almost every day in person, on phone, or email. He’s tremendously engaged and he’s the investment leader, a real workhorse in the department.” When asked what would happen if Danoff was somehow incapacitated, Hogan said, “We have a tremendously deep bench of portfolio managers who may not be household names yet but probably will be.” The problem is unique to Fidelity: the next-largest stock fund run by a single manager, the T Rowe Price Growth Stock fund, run by Joseph Fath, is at $44.1 billion under assets, while the third largest is another Fidelity product, the Fidelity Growth Company fund, at $39.2 billion, run by Steven Wymer. ‘ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR’ Since he took over Contrafund in September of 1990, Danoff has posted an average annualized gain of 13.3 percent, the best performance of any large cap growth fund over the same time, according to Lipper data. The benchmark S&P; 500 posted a 10 percent annualized gain over the same time, while the average actively managed large cap fund returned an annualized 9.4 percent. Someone who invested $10,000 in Contrafund in September 1990 would now have $213,719, more than double the $103,058 gain from investing in the S&P; 500. The average large cap fund, meanwhile, would have returned $95,586 from the same investment. That performance is one reason why Fidelity emphasizes the chance to work with him to potential recruits, and why he leads a meeting each year with all of the firm’s analysts that is said to be standing room only. Known to carry around a spiral notebook with handwritten notes on stocks, Danoff meets with hundreds of companies a year, and has easy access to management at companies who are keen to receive his endorsement. Danoff, who joined Fidelity in 1986 as an analyst, has a degree in history from Harvard and an MBA from Wharton. He’s known to walk around with a bulging file folder and messy hair, a marked contrast from some of the slickly-groomed fund managers who often show up on television. “I love Will Danoff, he’s like the absent-minded professor and he has encyclopedia knowledge of stocks,” said David Caruso, managing director of Danvers, Massachusetts Coastal Capital Group who oversees approximately $800 million in client assets. “If he were to leave I would have to think very hard about leaving my assets there.” Fidelity named John Roth as co-manager of another fund that Danoff had run by himself, the $27 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights fund, in 2013. The move was interpreted by many fund analysts as a sign that Roth will eventually become Danoff’s successor at Contrafund. Ford Motor Company announced last month it would drop Contrafund from its fund lineup, pulling $900 million from the fund. The company attributed the decision as part of a plan to “best suit the needs of our employees,” while retirement plan analysts said Ford has been removing funds run by stockpickers. Unlike competitor T. Rowe Price Group, which emphasizes its hub of analysts over individual fund managers, Fidelity’s reliance on star managers like Danoff poses a problem for it over the long-term, Rosenbluth added. “There’s a very small handful of managers who are known, and like everybody else they are getting older and sooner or later they will be retiring,” Rosenbluth said. “At that point it’s not inconceivable for investors to say I’m just going to choose a Vanguard 500 index fund from now on.”   (Reporting by David Randall; editing by Linda Stern and John Pickering)",9142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/contrafund-danoff/rpt-fidelitys-danoff-is-face-of-key-man-risk-as-he-hits-25-year-mark-idUSL1N11H28E20150914

His Contrafund, with $106.3 billion in assets under management, is a mainstay of retirement savings plans nationwide. Yet some financial advisors and fund analysts say they are concerned that Fidelity has yet to name a co-manager for Contrafund, setting up the risk that investors will flee and remaining shareholders will suffer should Danoff, 55, retire or otherwise leave the fund suddenly. “There is a key man risk with Contrafund,” said Katie Rushkewicz Reichart, an analyst at Morningstar who covers the fund. “Not only has Danoff done quite well but he’s managing such a large sum of money that it’s not a role that another person could easily step into.” Those concerns are an echo of last September, when Bill Gross, who often referred to himself as the king of bonds, abruptly left Pimco and his management of the Total Return fund. To be sure, Gross had his worst performance in nearly two decades in the year before he left Pimco, and the fund had seen 16 straight months of outflows leading up to his departure. After his departure, Total Return suffered $18 billion in outflows in the first month alone, and another $107 billion between October 2014 and August 2015, according to Lipper data. Should Danoff leave, a sizeable rush to redeem shares could force Contrafund to unload some of its positions in companies such as Facebook, Apple, and Walt Disney  in which it is one of the largest shareholders, analysts said. Retirement plans, meanwhile, may be forced to remove the fund from among its investment options because the fund would no longer have the same management team in place for at least three years. Most advisors and institutional investors require at least a three-year track record with current management before investing, and the slate is wiped clean if the principal manager leaves without having three years or more with a co-manager, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P; Capital IQ. Fidelity did not make Danoff available for this article, but said concerns about succession planning are overblown. “Will is not going anywhere,” said Brian Hogan, the head of Fidelity’s equity division. “I can say that with a lot of confidence. I talk to Will almost every day in person, on phone, or email. He’s tremendously engaged and he’s the investment leader, a real workhorse in the department.” When asked what would happen if Danoff was somehow incapacitated, Hogan said, “We have a tremendously deep bench of portfolio managers who may not be household names yet but probably will be.” The problem is unique to Fidelity: the next-largest stock fund run by a single manager, the T Rowe Price Growth Stock fund, run by Joseph Fath, is at $44.1 billion under assets, while the third largest is another Fidelity product, the Fidelity Growth Company fund, at $39.2 billion, run by Steven Wymer. ‘ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR’ Since he took over Contrafund in September of 1990, Danoff has posted an average annualized gain of 13.3 percent, the best performance of any large cap growth fund over the same time, according to Lipper data. The benchmark S&P; 500 posted a 10 percent annualized gain over the same time, while the average actively managed large cap fund returned an annualized 9.4 percent. Someone who invested $10,000 in Contrafund in September 1990 would now have $213,719, more than double the $103,058 gain from investing in the S&P; 500. The average large cap fund, meanwhile, would have returned $95,586 from the same investment. That performance is one reason why Fidelity emphasizes the chance to work with him to potential recruits, and why he leads a meeting each year with all of the firm’s analysts that is said to be standing room only. Known to carry around a spiral notebook with handwritten notes on stocks, Danoff meets with hundreds of companies a year, and has easy access to management at companies who are keen to receive his endorsement. Danoff, who joined Fidelity in 1986 as an analyst, has a degree in history from Harvard and an MBA from Wharton. He’s known to walk around with a bulging file folder and messy hair, a marked contrast from some of the slickly-groomed fund managers who often show up on television. “I love Will Danoff, he’s like the absent-minded professor and he has encyclopedia knowledge of stocks,” said David Caruso, managing director of Danvers, Massachusetts Coastal Capital Group who oversees approximately $800 million in client assets. “If he were to leave I would have to think very hard about leaving my assets there.” Fidelity named John Roth as co-manager of another fund that Danoff had run by himself, the $27 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights fund, in 2013. The move was interpreted by many fund analysts as a sign that Roth will eventually become Danoff’s successor at Contrafund. Ford Motor Company announced last month it would drop Contrafund from its fund lineup, pulling $900 million from the fund. The company attributed the decision as part of a plan to “best suit the needs of our employees,” while retirement plan analysts said Ford has been removing funds run by stockpickers. Unlike competitor T. Rowe Price Group, which emphasizes its hub of analysts over individual fund managers, Fidelity’s reliance on star managers like Danoff poses a problem for it over the long-term, Rosenbluth added. “There’s a very small handful of managers who are known, and like everybody else they are getting older and sooner or later they will be retiring,” Rosenbluth said. “At that point it’s not inconceivable for investors to say I’m just going to choose a Vanguard 500 index fund from now on.”   (Reporting by David Randall; editing by Linda Stern and John Pickering)",9142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/contrafund-danoff/fidelitys-danoff-is-face-of-key-man-risk-as-he-hits-25-year-mark-idUSL1N11F1CB20150914

Shares of the company, which also reported weak sales in its Monster High business, fell as much as 10 percent in after-market trading on Thursday. Mattel, which is in the middle of a turnaround plan, has been struggling to revive sales of Barbie, as young girls increasingly prefer interactive electronic toys and tablets. Sales of Barbie fell 4 percent on constant currency and 14 percent on a reported basis in the three months ended Sept. 30. This is the eighth straight quarter of declining sales for the 56-year-old Barbie brand. Mattel, which in 2014 got nearly half of its revenue from international markets, said a strong dollar also hurt sales. “Forex will continue to be a headwind across many key markets,” Chief Executive Christopher Sinclair said on a post-earnings call. Sinclair said the results were broadly in line with “our expectations at this stage of our turnaround”. The company said third-quarter adjusted and reported earnings per share reflect the negative impact of 20 cents from the strong dollar. Sinclair also said the company was “aggressively developing plans to offset the Disney Princess revenue gap”. Smaller rival Hasbro Inc in 2014 won the license to make Walt Disney Co’s Disney Princess dolls, including those based on the movie “Frozen”. Hasbro will start selling the toys in January. Mattel’s net income fell to $223.8 million, or 66 cents per share, in the quarter, from $331.8 million, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 71 cents per share, below analysts’ average estimate of 80 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales fell 11.3 percent to $1.79 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.89 billion. The El Segundo, California-based company’s shares regained some losses and were down 3 percent in extended trading. Up to Thursday’s close of $22.53, Mattel’s stock had fallen about 27 percent this year.

1036,DIS,Disney profit rises with gains at cable networks,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co reported higher quarterly profit that beat Wall Street forecasts as cable networks including ESPN brought in higher advertising revenue and collected more fees from pay TV distributors. Disney shares were roughly unchanged in after-hours trading. In August, the stock plummeted when the company acknowledged a decline in subscribers at ESPN, elevating fears across the pay television business about a shift to online video services.  For July through September, Disney’s net income rose to $1.61 billion, or 95 cents per share, from $1.50 billion, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.20 per share, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.14, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue came in slightly below analysts’ estimates. The company also said it lost subscribers at certain cable networks while it gained customers from the SEC Network it launched last year. Overall, the media networks unit that includes ESPN, the Disney Channels and ABC recorded a 27 percent increase in operating income to $1.8 billion. Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said the company was sticking with the forecast it gave in August when the company lowered its cable profit guidance after saying ESPN had experienced “modest” subscriber losses. On Thursday, Iger said he remained “bullish” about ESPN and “there was no reason to panic” about his earlier comments acknowledging changes in TV viewing habits. “We like the environment because we think long-term it gives us more opportunities,” Iger said.  The threat of “cord-cutting,” or dropping of pay TV service, remains a key concern for investors. On Wednesday, media stocks dropped when Time Warner Inc said it needed to take new steps to adapt to the television shakeup. CLSA analyst Vasily Karasyov said Disney’s latest results for ESPN “should be comforting” to shareholders. The company’s total revenue rose 9.1 percent to $13.51 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of about $13.57 billion. Disney’s theme parks unit posted a 7 percent rise in operating profit to $687 million, lifted by higher spending and attendance at its U.S. parks.  At the movie studio, films “Inside Out” and “Ant-Man” helped profit more than double to $530 million. The consumer products division recorded a 10 percent jump in profit to $416 million, driven by licensing revenue from “Frozen,” “Avengers” and classic “Star Wars” merchandise, the company said. Disney shares were down 0.1 percent in after-hours trading at $112.85.

1037,DIS,Raiders and Chargers tap Disney's Iger for new NFL stadium,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co CEO Bob Iger has teamed up with the National Football League’s Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers to try to build them a stadium in a Los Angeles suburb, backers of the project said in a statement on Wednesday. Iger has been named non-executive chairman of Carson Holdings LLC, the joint venture between the two teams that is working with the city of Carson, California, on a project to build a stadium in the city.  He will continue as Disney’s chairman and CEO, and will not be required to do anything that conflicts with that role, the statement from Carson Holdings said. Iger, one of the most powerful executives in Hollywood, could have the clout to attract major sponsors for the stadium project. His hiring represents a boost to the effort to bring the two National Football League teams to Carson.  The Chargers and the Raiders are seeking to gain support for their plan from NFL owners. The owner of the St. Louis Rams has been pursuing a rival proposal to build a stadium in Inglewood, just north of Carson, and relocate his team there. The announcement of Iger’s role on behalf of the Chargers and the Raiders came on the same day those two teams and the Rams presented their proposals to relocate to the Los Angeles area to NFL leaders in New York. The Los Angeles region, the second-largest market in U.S. sports, has been without an NFL team since 1995, when the Rams left Anaheim for St. Louis and the Raiders returned to their previous home of Oakland.  Iger, who will receive a salary of $1 a year in his position with Carson Holdings, will have an option once he departs his role at Disney to acquire a minority share in either the Raiders or the Chargers, said the statement from Carson Holdings. One of his main tasks is expected to be hiring the president of Carson Holdings.  “Should the owners approve the move, Los Angeles will proudly welcome two incredible teams to our community and build a stadium worthy of their fans,” Iger said in a statement.

1039,DIS,China fines five phony Disney hotels: Xinhua,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has fined five knock-off Disney hotels for infringing on the iconic U.S. entertainment company’s trademarks, state-run Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday in the run-up to the opening of a Walt Disney Co theme park in Shanghai. The news comes less than a month after Chinese authorities announced that they would give unprecedented special trademark protection to Disney in a year-long campaign around the park’s opening. The Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce (AIC), a business regulator, found that the hotels were all owned by the Shenzhen Vienna Hotels Group and had used the “Disney” trademark on their signs and websites without authorization, Xinhua said. The hotels were located in Shanghai’s Pudong district, where the theme park is due to open next year. Several calls to the Shenzhen Vienna Hotels Group for a comment were unsuccessful. “Hoping to cash in on the resort and attract customers, [the hotels] not only infringed trademark rights but are also suspected of unfair competition,” the report quoted the AIC as saying. The hotels were fined a combined 100,000 yuan ($15,656), it said. Lin Haihan, director of the Shanghai AIC’s trademark office, said the administration was inspecting other hotels for possible infringements, according to Xinhua.

U.S. stock markets were scheduled to close three hours early at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT) after being shuttered all day Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. “We’re going to get today over with and hit the ground running next week,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. Battle said he expected a busy start to next week as investors prepare for the non-farm payrolls report due Dec. 4, which will bring volatility ahead of the Fed’s widely expected decision to raise interest rates at its mid-December meeting. At 12:03 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.22 points, or 0.05 percent, to 17,804.17, the S&P; 500  gained 1.6 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,090.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.48 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,126.63. Eight out of the 10 major S&P; sectors were up modestly while the energy index fell 0.8 percent as crude oil prices fell and the consumer discretionary sector was down 0.4 percent, led by media stocks and retailers. Crowds were thin at U.S. stores and shopping malls in the early hours of Black Friday and on Thanksgiving evening as shoppers responded to early holiday discounts with caution and bad weather hurt turnout. The top retail movers were Signet Jewelers, down 1.8 percent followed by declines at Lowes Cos, Macys Inc  and Gap Inc. Other big retailers such as Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney  and online retail giant Amazon.com were down slightly while Best Buy fell 1.3 percent. The Dow Jones U.S. General Retailers index was down slightly. Thanksgiving kicks off the crucial November and December shopping season in which many retailers make anywhere between 20 percent and 40 percent of annual sales. The National Retail Federation sees holiday sales rising 3.7 percent, versus 2014’s 4.1 percent increase. “We believe Thanksgiving shopping was a bust,” analysts at Suntrust Robinson Humphrey said in a research note. “Members of our team who went to the malls first had no problem finding parking or navigating stores.” Performance Trust’s Battle, however, said Black Friday anecdotes were just “noise. “What matters most is the season as a whole and not just one day when some of that business is being done online,” he said. Dow component Walt Disney fell 3 percent to $114.97, after it said late on Wednesday that its ESPN sports network lost 3 million subscribers in 2015.

Traders on Friday priced in a 78 percent chance of a rate hike in December, up from about 52 percent last month, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch. Global markets were mainly lower, with the Chinese markets registering their biggest one-day drop in more than three months due to regulatory worries and a slowdown in profits at big industrial firms.

1050,DIS,"Early praise for Star Wars awakens the Force in shares of Disney, EA","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Early praise for the newest installment of “Star Wars” gave a boost to shares of Walt Disney and Electronic Arts, which recently launched a videogame based on the hugely popular space opera. Following prequels between 1999 and 2005 that were widely seen as disappointing compared to the original trilogy that began in 1977, fans at the premiere of “The Force Awakens” on late on Monday said the magic was back. On Tuesday, shares of Walt Disney rose 3.75 percent while Electronic Arts, which last month released its “Star Wars Battlefront” videogame after three years of development, jumped 5.26 percent. “Healthy chatter after the industry premiere last night in Los Angeles may have motivated some traders,” said JBL Advisors analyst Jeffrey Logsdon, who covers Disney.  Creator George Lucas sold the “Star Wars” franchise to Disney in 2012 for some $4 billion and the newest installment opens in most countries this week.

1051,DIS,"Early praise for Star Wars awakens the Force in shares of Disney, EA","SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Early praise for the newest installment of “Star Wars” gave a boost to shares of Walt Disney and Electronic Arts, which recently launched a videogame based on the hugely popular space opera. Following prequels between 1999 and 2005 that were widely seen as disappointing compared to the original trilogy that began in 1977, fans at the premiere of “The Force Awakens” on late on Monday said the magic was back. On Tuesday, shares of Walt Disney rose 3.75 percent while Electronic Arts, which last month released its “Star Wars Battlefront” videogame after three years of development, jumped 5.26 percent. “Healthy chatter after the industry premiere last night in Los Angeles may have motivated some traders,” said JBL Advisors analyst Jeffrey Logsdon, who covers Disney. Creator George Lucas sold the “Star Wars” franchise to Disney in 2012 for some $4 billion and the newest installment opens in most countries this week. It could gross $2.8 billion worldwide, Logsdon wrote in a note to clients. That would put it in the same league as all-time top grosser Avatar, distributed by Fox in 2009.

1054,DIS,Disney shares fall after BTIG cuts to 'sell' on ESPN woes,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s shares slumped after BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield cuts his rating to “sell” from “neutral”, saying the likely success of the latest Star Wars movie would not be enough to offset the impact of subscriber losses at ESPN. Disney’ shares fell as much as 3.6 percent to $108.01 on Friday as BTIG became the only brokerage among 33 to rate the stock “sell”. The company first warned of subscriber losses at ESPN in August and since then other media companies have spoken of concerns that viewers are increasingly opting for online streaming over pay TV. Disney’s management made a mistake by overpaying for sports rights based on “overly aggressive” multichannel video subscriber projections, Greenfield wrote in a note to clients. “ESPN now appears poised to become Disney’s most troubled business as consumer behavior shifts rapidly,” he said. BTIG thinks “Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens” would help Disney “modestly” top earnings estimates in 2016, but said consensus estimates were “too high” for 2017 and “far too high” for 2018. “Our problem is not 2016 ... our problem is that we don’t think they have significant growth from there forward,” Greenfield said on CNBC. Greenfield said Disney’s cable network’s profitability would meaningfully underperform investor expectations, which would eat into operating income in 2017. Cable networks represents about 46 percent of Disney’s total operating income. Greenfield said if the new Star Wars movie did not rake in more than $2 billion in worldwide box office revenue, Disney would miss Wall Street’s profit estimates in 2016 as well. BTIG had a “buy” rating on the stock for five years until March, Greenfield said on CNBC. Disney’s shares were down 2.3 percent at $109.39 in late morning trading.

The seventh movie in the celebrated sci-fi franchise is projected to sell close to $220 million worth of tickets in the United States and Canada through Sunday, beating the record $208.8 million for “Jurassic World” in June, Disney said. The movie already smashed several film industry records and won praise from critics and moviegoers. It collected $120.5 million on Friday, its first full day in domestic theaters, the highest single-day ticket sales ever.  That includes a chart-topping $57 million from fans who rushed out to see the first showings on Thursday night. “Force Awakens” began rolling out in global markets on Wednesday. Through Friday, international ticket sales reached $129.5 million, setting opening-day records in Britain, Germany, Australia, Brazil and other countries.  The new “Star Wars” film is the first installment in a decade in the series created by George Lucas in 1977. Disney bought “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012 and spent more than $200 million to produce “Force Awakens”. The movie is now open in all markets except Greece and India, where it opens Dec. 24, and China, which has set a Jan. 9 debut. China is the world’s second-largest film market.  “Force Awakens” has a shot at becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time, according to some analysts. The current record holder is “Avatar,” which generated $2.8 billion worldwide after its December 2009 release.      Critics applauded “Force Awakens,” which features newcomers Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac alongside original stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.

1060,DIS,Historic 'Star Wars' debut hands Disney another hit franchise,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” shattered box office records with an estimated $517 million in worldwide ticket sales through Sunday, a staggering debut that re-established the celebrated space saga as a global phenomenon under Walt Disney Co. The first “Star Wars” film in a decade recorded the biggest domestic opening in Hollywood’s history, collecting $238 million over the weekend in the United States and Canada. It also set records in Britain, Australia, Russia and elsewhere as fans embraced a new chapter in the galactic battle between good and evil. Thousands joined a mock lightsaber battle in Los Angeles, where an Australian couple married in line for the film. President Obama ended a news conference on Friday saying he needed to head to a White House screening of the movie, and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton closed Saturday’s Democratic debate saying, “May the Force be with you.” “I don’t think ever in the history of movies has their been more hype leading up to release of a film,” said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. “This is a huge, huge win.” The film’s financial and critical success mark a victory for Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger’s strategy of acquiring proven brands, including Pixar Animation and comic book powerhouse Marvel, to fuel Disney’s entertainment empire. Disney purchased “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012 as part of his bet on big-budget films. Movie theater attendance in the United States and Canada, the world’s largest film market, has barely changed in a decade as online and mobile platforms exploded. Subscribers to Disney’s sports powerhouse, ESPN, have shrunk, a much-noted sign of pressure on traditional media. The turnout for “Star Wars” is an encouraging result for Disney, rival media companies and movie theaters. “We have so many options for entertainment, yet look at where everyone is flocking this weekend - to the multiplex,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at box office tracking firm Rentrak. “Disney has this down to a science.” Global sales for “Force Awakens” finished second only to the dinosaur film “Jurassic World,” which in its June opening garnered $525 million worldwide, including China, where the “Star Wars” film will not open for weeks. “Jurassic World” took $208.8 million at domestic theaters in its first weekend. “Force Awakens” is the seventh installment in the epic science-fiction franchise created by George Lucas in 1977. Filmgoers reveled in the return to the “Star Wars” galaxy, dressing as Jedi or Sith, carrying lightsabers and cheering when classic characters such as Princess Leia or Chewbacca appeared on screen. Theaters added showtimes to meet demand.   Disney plans four “Star Wars” movies through 2019, plus major expansions at its U.S. theme parks to incorporate the droids, spaceships and otherworldly creatures of the universe Lucas invented. “Force Awakens” toys, clothing, home accessories and video games already pervade stores ahead of Christmas. A Reuters Breakingviews analysis last week calculated that Disney may be on track to triple its Lucasfilm investment and earn an average of $669 million off the franchise in each of the next six years. Nostalgia, plus a carefully planned, months-long release of film trailers and character profiles boosted interest. Disney, which spent more than $200 million to make “Force Awakens,” also created intrigue by keeping the plot largely secret.   Critics lauded the movie’s throwback feel, doses of humor and the performances of newcomers Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac.

1067,DIS,Historic 'Star Wars' debut hands Disney another hit franchise,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” shattered box office records with an estimated $517 million in worldwide ticket sales through Sunday, a staggering debut that re-established the celebrated space saga as a global phenomenon under Walt Disney Co. The first “Star Wars” film in a decade recorded the biggest domestic opening in Hollywood’s history, collecting $238 million over the weekend in the United States and Canada. It also set records in Britain, Australia, Russia and elsewhere as fans embraced a new chapter in the galactic battle between good and evil. Thousands joined a mock lightsaber battle in Los Angeles, where an Australian couple married in line for the film. President Obama ended a news conference on Friday saying he needed to head to a White House screening of the movie, and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton closed Saturday’s Democratic debate saying, “May the Force be with you.” “I don’t think ever in the history of movies has their been more hype leading up to release of a film,” said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. “This is a huge, huge win.” The film’s financial and critical success mark a victory for Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger’s strategy of acquiring proven brands, including Pixar Animation and comic book powerhouse Marvel, to fuel Disney’s entertainment empire. Disney purchased “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012 as part of his bet on big-budget films. Movie theater attendance in the United States and Canada, the world’s largest film market, has barely changed in a decade as online and mobile platforms exploded. Subscribers to Disney’s sports powerhouse, ESPN, have shrunk, a much-noted sign of pressure on traditional media. The turnout for “Star Wars” is an encouraging result for Disney, rival media companies and movie theaters. “We have so many options for entertainment, yet look at where everyone is flocking this weekend - to the multiplex,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at box office tracking firm Rentrak. “Disney has this down to a science.” Global sales for “Force Awakens” finished second only to the dinosaur film “Jurassic World,” which in its June opening garnered $525 million worldwide, including China, where the “Star Wars” film will not open for weeks. “Jurassic World” took $208.8 million at domestic theaters in its first weekend. “Force Awakens” is the seventh installment in the epic science-fiction franchise created by George Lucas in 1977. Filmgoers reveled in the return to the “Star Wars” galaxy, dressing as Jedi or Sith, carrying lightsabers and cheering when classic characters such as Princess Leia or Chewbacca appeared on screen.

1070,DIS,"'Star Wars' takes Chinese social media by storm, flirts with record release","SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - After a mammoth marketing campaign, growing online chatter in China around “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” suggests the latest installment of the hit franchise has a shot at breaking box office records in the world’s second-largest movie market. China is crucial if Walt Disney Co’s first foray into the world of Jedi knights is to earn a spot among the top-grossing films of all time. The movie, the seventh in a near 40-year-old franchise, surged past “Jurassic World” to set a global opening weekend record of $529 million.  Disney has had to work hard for its “Star Wars” buzz in China. Though the franchise launched in 1977 - a year after the end of the Cultural Revolution and the death of China’s founding leader Mao Zedong - the original films weren’t shown in movie theatres until this June. But after promotions featuring everything from 500 model stormtroopers on the Great Wall to a pop star dubbed China’s answer to Justin Bieber, a Reuters analysis of posts on popular microblog Sina Weibo shows “Star Wars” has been mentioned around 700,000 times since the start of December, outpacing other big hit Hollywood releases in China this year. “I roughly know the story plot but I have never seen any of the films in the series before,” admitted Yao Yiyun, 22, a computer programming student in Shanghai. “When it comes out at the cinemas I want to see it though, especially because I like science fiction.” Online chatter won’t guarantee box office success in China for the film, which has a red-carpet premiere in Shanghai on Sunday and goes on general release in the mainland on Jan. 9. But curiosity among the world’s biggest online community  could help the film rival smash hits like action movie “Furious 7”, the latest in a series long popular with Chinese viewers that took over $180 million in its opening weekend in China.  Over a comparable period in its pre-release schedule, “Furious 7” had racked up 230,000 Weibo hits, before soaring to over 300,000 hits in a single day when it opened this year. Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co, predicts “The Force Awakens” will take in some $100 million during its first weekend in China. Others forecast more. “The movie is going to do well regardless of its take here,” said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal of China Market Research Group. “But if it wants to target global records then how it does in China is going to be critical.” In 2005, the previous Star Wars installment was comparatively unknown in China and brought in just $9 million in ticket sales. But moviegoing has become hugely popular in the meantime, with the Chinese box office set to hit almost $9 billion in 2019 from $5 billion this year, according to PwC, fast catching up with the United States. Piracy, once the scourge of Hollywood in China, is also not as rampant as it once was, as increasingly active Chinese film companies have pressured the government to crack down. The film’s delayed release date may also help, as Chinese viewers see the success abroad first. “(Chinese moviegoers) are very attuned to what happens in the rest of the world,” said Greg Foster, chief executive of cinema group IMAX Corp, which saw the film take in $48 million in its theatres worldwide in its opening weekend. Disney, for its part, has pulled out the stops. As well as running ads featuring Chinese pop star Lu Han as an honorary Jedi “ambassador” for the movie and making use of the of the iconic Great Wall, it has reconfigured posters to enhance the fighter jets popular with local viewers.

Sales of toys such as Kylo Ren light sabers, BB-8 droids and models of the Millennium Falcon spacecraft totaled more than those related to movie franchises “Jurassic World,” “Minions” and “Avengers” combined, NPD Group said on Wednesday. Led by “Star Wars” merchandise, toy sales in the United States rose 6.7 percent to $19.4 billion in 2015, making it one of the strongest performances for toy sales in years, NPD Group said. Sales took off on Sept. 4, or “Force Friday”, when retailers launched merchandise in anticipation of the opening of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” the first Star Wars film produced by Walt Disney Co. ""With the early release of 'Star Wars' toys on Force Friday, 'Star Wars' managed to become the number-one property for the year,"" NPD said.

Toys based on characters from the new movie were tough to find after Christmas, said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of toys and sporting goods review website TTPM. Disney said last week that new toys and collectibles related to the movie are rolling out at Disney stores and mass retailers across the United States.   Many new products feature the female scavenger Rey, the lead character in “Force Awakens.” Some customers had complained she appeared under-represented on store shelves filled with male characters from the film. Disney said it kept some Rey products under wraps to prevent revealing key plot points before the movie’s release. The company also underestimated the character’s popularity, said Paul Southern, the head of “Star Wars” licensing in Disney’s consumer products division. After the film debuted, sales of Rey products at Disney retail stores grew three times faster than other “Force Awakens” characters, a company spokeswoman said. Others, such as a limited edition Rey and BB-8 figure, sold out quickly. “Rey came in with a huge amount of momentum and ultimately above what we were expecting,” Southern said. “We really struggled to keep Rey on retail shelves.”     “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” has become the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, beating 2009’s hit 3D sci-fi movie “Avatar”.

1101,DIS,US STOCKS-S&P; 500 flat; Yellen sees no reason to reverse hike plan,"* Fed not likely to reverse course on rates despite risks * Disney’s 3.8 pct drop weighs on Dow * Indexes: Dow down 0.6 pct, S&P; down 0.02 pct, Nasdaq up 0.4 pct   (Updates to close) By Caroline Valetkevitch Feb 10 (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 ended flat on Wednesday, losing gains late in the session as investors digested comments by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who kept options open for more rate hikes but also saw risks to the U.S. economy. The Dow and S&P; posted their fourth straight day of losses while the Nasdaq ended its three-day down streak. The market had traded higher for much of the session after Yellen told Congress she does not expect the central bank to reverse the rate hike program it began in December. But Yellen also acknowledged tightening financial conditions and uncertainty about China. “The market was strong (early in the day) because Janet Yellen confirmed the fact the Fed would go very slow on rate hikes because the economy was showing some signs of sluggishness,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. “But maybe she is saying the economy is slower than most of us were thinking.” The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 99.64 points, or 0.62 percent, to 15,914.74, the S&P; 500 lost 0.35 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,851.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.83 points, or 0.35 percent, to 4,283.59. U.S. stocks have struggled since the start of the year amid mounting worries over a slowdown in global and U.S. economic growth. The Dow and S&P; 500 are down about 9 percent each so far in 2016; the Nasdaq has lost about 14 percent. Materials and energy shares were Wednesday’s biggest losers following further losses in U.S. oil prices. A 3.8 percent drop in Walt Disney shares was the biggest drag on the Dow. Disney dropped to $88.85 after reporting lower profit at its ESPN sports network. Technology and healthcare shares rebounded from recent losses, however. The S&P; technology index was up 0.4 percent while healthcare was up 0.9 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,646 to 1,429, for a 1.15-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,390 issues rose and 1,382 fell for a 1.01-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

1102,DIS,US STOCKS-Wall St up as Yellen eases concerns about economy,"* Yellen sees no reason to reverse rate hike plan * Tech stocks up after 3 days of losses * Disney’s steep drop after results caps Dow’s gains * Indexes up: Dow 0.34 pct, S&P; 1 pct, Nasdaq 1.70 pct   (Updates to early afternoon) By Abhiram Nandakumar Feb 10 (Reuters) - Wall Street was on track to snap a three-day losing run on Wednesday after comments by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen eased investor concerns about the capacity of the economy to absorb a gradual rise in interest rates. Yellen acknowledged that tightening financial conditions and uncertainty about China posed risks to the U.S. economy, but told Congress she does not expect the central bank to reverse the rate hike program it began in December. The Fed expects economic growth to pick up in the current quarter, which would allow it to pursue its plan of “gradual” adjustments to monetary policy, she said. Fears of a China-led global economic slowdown and oil’s steep slide since the Fed raised rates in December have dampened the market’s expectations for a hike in coming months. “What Yellen said has been taken positively,” said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer of Philadelphia Trust Co in Philadelphia. “Stocks in general are cheaper now than they were three days ago or three months ago, so there’s an opportunity to step in.” Stock markets have sagged under a double whammy of the uncertainty surrounding monetary policy and steep decline in commodity prices, while corporate results and economic data offered little respite. At 12:46 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was up 54.24 points, or 0.34 percent, at 16,068.62. The index wobbled under the weight of Disney’s 3.6 percent fall. The S&P; 500 was up 18.74 points, or 1.01 percent, at 1,870.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 72.45 points, or 1.7 percent, at 4,341.21. Eight of the 10 major sectors were higher, led by a 2.08 percent rise in the health sector. Tech stocks  were up 1.4 percent, set to snap a streak of three days of declines. Facebook was up 3 percent, while Microsoft  and Alphabet rose 1.5-2.5 percent. Disney dropped nearly 4 percent to $88.97 after reporting lower profit at its ESPN sports network. The stock hit its lowest since October 2014. Time Warner fell 1 percent to $62.73 after reporting as steeper-than-expected drop in revenue. Akamai soared 22.7 percent to $48.51 after the online content distributor’s revenue beat estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,200 to 801. On the Nasdaq, 1,917 issues rose and 767 fell.

1103,DIS,ESPN casts shadow over 'Star Wars' success at Disney,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s ESPN sports network posted a decline in quarterly profit, overshadowing the blockbuster success of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which lifted the company to record income and topped Wall Street expectations. Investors nervous about the future prospects for Disney and other older media companies sent its shares down 3.5 percent to $89.21 in after-hours trading. The media networks unit that includes ESPN, the Disney Channels and ABC recorded a 5.6 percent decline in operating income to $1.41 billion. That was due in part to higher programming costs and a subscriber decline at ESPN, which offset an increase in advertising revenue. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger offered a spirited defense of ESPN on a conference call, describing an “uptick” in customers in the last couple months. Investors and analysts worry that Disney and other media companies are being abandoned by “cord cutters,” especially younger viewers unwilling to pay for cable TV bundles of television channels. “This notion that either the expanded basic bundle is experiencing its demise, or that ESPN is cratering in any way from a subscriber perspective, is just ridiculous,” Iger said. “Sports is too popular.” “We fully expect our media networks, including ESPN to continue to deliver bottom-line growth, which means ad revenue growth will continue to outpace spending,” he added. Disney is in discussions with distributors about featuring ESPN in more of the slimmed-down channel packages, Iger said, as well as other new offerings. ESPN is part of Dish Network Corp’s Sling TV, and earlier customer losses were due largely to ESPN’s absence from some other skinnier TV packages, he said.     For the December quarter, ESPN faced higher programming costs due to a change in the timing of college football bowl games, and the strong dollar also hurt results, Disney said. Concerns about rising expenses for sports rights coupled with subscriber defections have left investors unsure about ESPN’s growth prospects, said Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant.  “Not everyone is a sports fan and willing to pay for sports,” Jayant said. That unease has been weighing for months on media stocks. Viacom Inc shares on Tuesday fell 21 percent after missing Wall Street sales estimates for a fifth straight quarter. The hero of Disney earnings was “Force Awakens”, the first “Star Wars” movie produced by Disney after it bought Lucasfilm in 2012. The stellar launch of the movie helped the studio business almost double its operating income to $1.01 billion. Disney’s U.S. theme parks reported higher spending and attendance, boosting operating income for the parks and resorts unit by 22 percent in the quarter to $981 million. The company’s overall net income rose to a record $2.88 billion in the fiscal first quarter, or $1.73 per share, from $2.18 billion, or $1.27 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.63 per share, that handily beat analysts’ average estimate of $1.45 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1105,DIS,Disney's Hong Kong park posts loss as Chinese visitor numbers skid,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) Hong Kong theme park posted its first net loss in four years in 2015 as Chinese visitor numbers slumped, a potential headache for the U.S. firm as it prepares to open its first mainland Chinese park in June. The park posted a net loss of HK$148 million ($19 million)for the year, dropping into the red after three straight years of profits, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council Panel on Economic Development said in a report released on Monday. Hong Kong has been hit hard by slowing economic growth in China, which has battered the number of big-spending Chinese tourists traveling to the city. Its retail sales saw their worst annual decline last year since 2002. Hong Kong tourist arrivals fell 2.5 percent in 2015 to 59.32 million, the first decline since 2003 when the city lifted travel restrictions for some mainland Chinese. Mainland visitors account for about three quarters of visitors. ""The tourism industry of Hong Kong was greeted with great challenges due to external factors as well as overall market condition and sentiment,"" the report, posted on China's Tourism Commission website (bit.ly/1ObirqL), said. The Hong Kong Disney park saw revenues of HK$5.1 billion in 2015, a decrease of 6 percent against a year earlier, the report said, the first revenue drop for the park since 2009. Visitor numbers also fell nearly 10 percent, the first decline since at least 2008, driven by a steep drop in mainland guests. “Lower visitation from mainland China and the region largely contributed to softer overall theme park attendance,” Disney said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The opening of the larger Shanghai resort could dent the fortunes of the Hong Kong park further, the panel said in the report, adding the park was looking at how to stay competitive in light of “intensifying competition” and “the opening of the Shanghai Disney Resort in June this year”. Disney’s $5.5 billion Shanghai resort, a joint venture between the U.S. entertainment giant and Chinese state-backed consortium Shanghai Shendi Group, is slated to open on June 16.

1109,DIS,"Disney resets theme park ticket prices for slow, busy times","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) unveiled new single-day ticket prices on Saturday for the company’s U.S. theme parks, switching to a three-tiered system that charges visitors more on the year’s busiest days and less during typically slower periods. The shift to demand-based pricing is designed to help spread out crowds at Walt Disney World in Florida and at Disneyland Resort in California, Disney said in a blog post. Starting Sunday, a one-day ticket to Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom will cost $105 on “value” days during slower periods, such as September. The cost for “regular” days will be $110. For “peak” days over major holiday periods, spring break and parts of the summer, the price will be $124. At Disneyland, the cost of admission to one park will be $95, $105 and $119 for value, regular and peak days, respectively. Value days will be most weekdays during the school year, while peak times are around holidays and weekends in July and December. The previous one-day ticket prices were $105 at the Magic Kingdom and $99 at Disneyland. The number of visitors to Disney’s U.S. parks set records in the October through December quarter, rising 10 percent from a year earlier, the company said in its quarterly earnings report. The busiest days create frustrations for visitors such as long lines and temporary gate closures when parks get too full. The company is expanding the parks with new attractions based on popular franchises such as “Star Wars” and “Frozen.” Disney said it will post eight- to 11-month calendars online that list which days fall in each pricing period.

1114,DIS,Disney's 'Zootopia' opens big with $73.7 million debut,"LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Disney’s “Zootopia” scored the fourth biggest March opening ever, debuting to $73.7 million over the weekend. The animated story about a rabbit who joins the police force ranks as the biggest Disney Animation launch (though not the best Pixar debut), outstripping “Frozen,” the 2012 blockbuster that bowed to $67.4 million. With no major family film opening until “The Jungle Book” lands on April 15, “Zootopia” is well positioned to be the de facto choice for moviegoers with children for the next month. “There’s an absence of competition,” said Dave Hollis, Disney’s distribution chief. “We are set up to have a big, big run.” Disney did not release a budget, but most animated films cost in excess of $100 million. “Zootopia” screened in 3,827 locations. Overseas, where “Zootopia” has been playing for three weeks, the film added another $63.4 million to its haul, pushing its global total to $232.5 million. The film continues a sterling comeback run for Disney Animation, which had reached a creative and commercial nadir in the early aughts with the likes of “Home on the Range” and “Treasure Planet.” Since Pixar’s Ed Catmull and John Lasseter took the reins following Disney’s 2006 acquisition of their company, the animation arm has roared back to life, fielding hits such as “Frozen,” “Tangled,” and “Wreck It Ralph,” and winning Oscars. “They brought a focus on quality,” said Hollis. “They recognize that quality is the best business plan.” Beyond the bunnies, Gerard Butler managed to wash out some of the sour taste in his mouth after “Gods of Egypt” flopped spectacularly. “London Has Fallen,” the Scottish actor’s followup to “Olympus Has Fallen,” opened solidly to $21.5 million from 3,490 locations for a second place finish. That does, however, trail the first film’s $30 million debut. Focus Features fielded the picture, which carried a $60 million price tag. It played older, with more than 76% of the audience clocking in over the age of 25, while men made up 60% of ticket buyers. “We’re really pleased with the opening and we think we’re going to leg out well from here,” said Jim Orr, Focus’ distribution chief. “That older demographic doesn’t necessarily rush out on opening weekend.” Tina Fey was not as lucky as Butler. The actress’ “Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” stumbled with a $7.6 million launch from 2,374 venues. Paramount backed the $35 million dramedy about a war reporter who gets hooked on the adrenaline rush of covering Afghanistan. War films and political comedies can be tough sells — witness the financial failures of “Charlie Wilson’s War,” “Our Brand is Crisis,” and “Jarhead” — and “Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” appears to be no exception. The studio isn’t ready to wave a white flag yet. Paramount Vice Chairman Rob Moore said that he hoped the audience would build in the coming weeks, as it did for Fey’s recent hit “Sisters.” “We were hoping for more,” he said. “But Tina’s last movie played to a good multiple and we had a good Saturday, so we have a chance of playing for a little while to a reasonable outcome.” After four weeks in theaters, “Deadpool” barreled past the $300 million mark. The comic book movie finished in third place with $16.4 million, pushing its domestic haul to $311.1 million. “Gods of Egypt” rounded out the top five, picking up $5 million. The $140 million action epic has earned a meagre $22.8 million domestically after two weeks — a terrible result for a picture that was intended to usher in a new franchise. Fresh off its best picture win at last weekend’s Academy Awards, newspaper drama “Spotlight” capitalized on the Oscar love by pulling in $1.8 million. The film has netted $41.6 million during its theatrical run. In limited release, Broad Green debuted “Knight of Cubs,” Terrence Malick’s lyrical portrait of the spiritual journey of a writer (Christian Bale), in four theaters where it earned $56,688 for a $14,172 per-screen average. March was once seen as a dumping ground for movies, but the success of spring releases like “The Hunger Games,” “Alice in Wonderland,” “Cinderella,” and now “Zootopia” has shattered that prejudice, analysts say. “This proves March is now a blockbuster month,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore. “You can open a blockbuster any time of the year.”",3062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-boxoffice/disneys-zootopia-opens-big-with-73-7-million-debut-idUSKCN0W80WQ
1115,DIS,UPDATE 2-Harrison Ford returns for 5th 'Indiana Jones' movie,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Harrison Ford and director Steven Spielberg are teaming up to make a fifth “Indiana Jones” action-adventure movie, due for release in July 2019, Walt Disney Co said Tuesday. Ford, 73, will reprise his role as the Fedora-clad archaeologist and adventurer who first appeared in 1981’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”  “Indiana Jones is one of the greatest heroes in cinematic history and we can’t wait to bring him back to the screen in 2019,” Disney chairman Alan Horn said in a statement.   The as yet untitled film will come 11 years after the last installment, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” in which Ford’s Jones reunited with his former love Marion (Karen Allen) and discovered he had a grown son, Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). The film received mixed reviews. Disney did not say whether Allen and LaBeouf would return and did not reveal plot details. Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall will produce the film. Spielberg, 69, has directed all the “Indiana Jones” films. Tuesday’s announcement follows the success of Disney’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” the third highest-grossing film worldwide of all time, in which Ford reprised his action star role and regained his box office appeal as space smuggler Han Solo who was first seen in 1977. The “Indiana Jones” franchise, created by filmmaker George Lucas, has grossed nearly $2 billion at the global box office with four films and amassed a global fan base.  The announcement quickly became a top ten trending topic on Twitter, but reaction was mixed. Many made fun of Ford’s age, offering tongue-in-cheek suggestions for the film’s title, such as “Indiana Jones and the Alzheimers,” and “Indiana Jones and ‘Hey You Kids, Get Off My Lawn!” The new film is the first “Indiana Jones” movie that Disney will make after it bought the distribution rights for the franchise from Viacom Inc’s Paramount Pictures in 2013.  Disney also acquired Lucas’ LucasFilm, the production company behind “Indiana Jones” and “Star Wars” films, in 2012.

1116,DIS,Harrison Ford returns for 5th 'Indiana Jones' movie,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Harrison Ford and director Steven Spielberg are teaming up to make a fifth “Indiana Jones” action-adventure movie, due for release in July 2019, Walt Disney Co said Tuesday. Ford, 73, will reprise his role as the Fedora-clad archaeologist and adventurer who first appeared in 1981’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”  “Indiana Jones is one of the greatest heroes in cinematic history and we can’t wait to bring him back to the screen in 2019,” Disney chairman Alan Horn said in a statement.   The as yet untitled film will come 11 years after the last installment, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” in which Ford’s Jones reunited with his former love Marion (Karen Allen) and discovered he had a grown son, Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). The film received mixed reviews. Disney did not say whether Allen and LaBeouf would return and did not reveal plot details. Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall will produce the film. Spielberg, 69, has directed all the “Indiana Jones” films. Tuesday’s announcement follows the success of Disney’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” the third highest-grossing film worldwide of all time, in which Ford reprised his action star role and regained his box office appeal as space smuggler Han Solo who was first seen in 1977. The “Indiana Jones” franchise, created by filmmaker George Lucas, has grossed nearly $2 billion at the global box office with four films and amassed a global fan base.  The announcement quickly became a top ten trending topic on Twitter, but reaction was mixed. Many made fun of Ford’s age, offering tongue-in-cheek suggestions for the film’s title, such as “Indiana Jones and the Alzheimers,” and “Indiana Jones and ‘Hey You Kids, Get Off My Lawn!” The new film is the first “Indiana Jones” movie that Disney will make after it bought the distribution rights for the franchise from Viacom Inc’s Paramount Pictures in 2013.  Disney also acquired Lucas’ LucasFilm, the production company behind “Indiana Jones” and “Star Wars” films, in 2012.  The franchise also spawned a 1990s television series “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles,” along with popular attractions at Disney theme parks.

1118,DIS,Fitch Affirms Disney's IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) assigned to The Walt Disney Company (Disney) and its subsidiaries.  The Rating Outlook remains Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of  this release. Approximately $18.9 billion of debt outstanding as of Jan. 2, 2016  is affected by Fitch's action. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Financial Flexibility: Disney's operating profile positions the  company to generate free cash flow (FCF) in excess of $3.5 billion annually  during the ratings horizon, which coupled with strong liquidity and solid credit  metrics provides the company with considerable financial flexibility at the  current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resorts segment  is expected to increase capital spending to approximately $5 billion during  fiscal 2016, which will temporarily hamper FCF generation. Consistent Financial Policy: Given the strength of Disney's underlying  businesses, strong liquidity position and Fitch's FCF expectations, Disney has  the financial flexibility to accommodate a higher level of share repurchases,  which are expected to range between $6 billion and $8 billion during fiscal  2016, in a manner consistent with its current ratings. Ratings incorporate  Fitch's expectations that the company's share repurchases and M&A; activity will  likely exceed FCF generation given strong liquidity and the current credit  profile. Leading Market Positions and Leveragability: Disney has a very consistent  investment strategy centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and  content that is leverageable across Disney's various platforms. Disney is  uniquely positioned, relative to its peers, to capitalize and monetize its  internally or externally developed franchises and brands, which in turn  strengthens the company's operating and credit profile and provides Disney with  a sustainable competitive advantage. Strength of Cable Networks: Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks, ESPN in  particular, underlies the company's ratings. Fitch Ratings believes that the  top-tier channels will continue to be a must carry for the distributors and are  likely to retain pricing power. Disney's operating profile benefits from the  stability, recurring dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF  generation characteristics attributable to its cable network business. Fitch  expects this segment will continue to generate a significant amount of Disney's  cash flow. Credible Strategy to Address Threats: Disney's strong asset portfolio positions  the company to address the secular threats and opportunities presented by  emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience fragmentation  across the media and entertainment landscape. Overall the ratings reflect the company's leading market positions within its  core businesses. Further, Disney has a very consistent investment strategy that  is centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and content that is  leverageable across its various platforms (cable and broadcast network, studio,  parks and resorts, and consumer products).  Disney's operating profile positions the company to generate meaningful levels  of FCF (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and  dividends), providing the company with considerable financial flexibility at the  current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resort segment  is expected to increase capital spending to approximately $5 billion during  fiscal 2016, which will temporarily hamper FCF generation during fiscal 2016.  Fitch anticipates that Disney will generate in excess of $3.5 billion of annual  FCF during the ratings horizon. Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks underlies the company's ratings, and  its operating profile continues to benefit from the stable, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile and high operating margin characteristics  attributable to its cable network business. Fitch believes there is sufficient  flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate slower affiliate fee  revenue and operating income growth within this business.  Disney's cable networks generate the largest portion of total revenue and  EBITDA, resulting in incremental stability in the total revenue and FCF profile.  Secular issues such as the stagnant multi-channel video subscriber base and its  effect on affiliate fee revenue, rising programming costs, particularly sports  programming, the impact of foreign exchange, and Disney's ability to pass the  higher costs on to multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs) will  remain a significant risk to the company's operating profile. However, Fitch  believes that Disney is in a strong position to retain pricing power going  forward, as its collection of top-tier cable networks continue to command  audience and ratings and be a must-carry for the MVPDs. In addition, Disney has,  in large part, successfully matched the tenor of its long-term sports  programming rights with the terms of its various affiliation agreements with the  MVPDs.  Ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the company's businesses, particularly  Parks & Resorts (30% of Disney's revenue through the LTM Jan. 2, 2016), Consumer  Products & Interactive Media, and the advertising portion of broadcast and cable  networks (16%). Should macroeconomic volatility return, Fitch expects these  cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure but that the company's credit  and financial profile will likely remain within expectations for the current  ratings.  Disney is well positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities  presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience  fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. The evolving media  landscape, including the growing prominence of Internet-based and time shifted  television content, will not have a material negative impact on Disney's credit  profile or FCF over the intermediate term. Further, in Fitch's view, the  proliferation of new over-the-top entrants and methods of consumption will  continue to drive more demand for Disney's content. As to the uncertainty around  the continued ability of cable networks to pass increased programming costs on  to the distributors, Fitch believes it poses moderate risk to cable network  providers over the longer term. Mitigants for Disney include Fitch's belief that  the top-tier channels will retain leverage with distributors going forward. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --The revenue growth within the company's cable networks business (Disney's  Media Networks segment) reflects the stability of the business and expected  affiliate fee increases. Fitch anticipates mid-single-digit affiliate revenue  growth.  --Disney's broadcasting business benefits from a stable economic and advertising  environment while incorporating typical political advertising revenue cycle.  Additionally this segment will benefit from growing retransmission consent fees.  Revenue growth ranges between 2% during non-political years and 4% during  political years. --Programming expenses are expected to increase by high-single digits driven by  sports rights costs.  --Fitch assumes typical volatility within the Studio Entertainment, Parks and  Resort, and Consumer Products & Interactive Media operating segments.  --Domestic revenues grow faster than International revenues within the company's  Parks and Resort segment. Fitch incorporates start-up expenses related to the  opening of its Shanghai Disney Resort in 2016.  --Fitch expects low double digit growth within Disney's Studio Entertainment  segment this year due to the release of Star Wars and a strong 2016 film slate.  Theatrical revenues are slightly offset by a weaker Home Video release schedule  when compared to 2015. Home entertainment revenues will track the theatrical  success in 2017 and 2018. Television and SVOD revenues grow at a mid-single  digit pace while home entertainment revenues remain flat. --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes relatively flat margins  within the company's Media Networks segment as retransmission revenue gains  enhance broadcast margins while cable network margins remain stable reflecting  the company's ability to grow higher margin affiliate fee revenues at a similar  pace to increasing programming costs. Disney's pre-opening expenses related to  its Shanghai Disneyland opening are expected to be offset by strong domestic  operating performance leading to relatively flat margins within the company's  Parks and Resorts segment. Coming off a strong operating performance in fiscal  2015, margins within Studio Entertainment are expected to contract somewhat  during fiscal 2016. LEVERAGE AND FINANCIAL POLICY Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial policy  over the ratings horizon. Fitch believes Disney maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of its business. In terms of  capital allocation priority, Fitch believes investing in internal opportunities  focused on organic growth, such as the company's investment in its various parks  and resorts worldwide and long term sports rights deals, takes precedence over  merger and acquisitions and shareholder returns. Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain consistent and  within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated leverage of  1.1x as of the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended Jan. 2, 2016, is in line with  fiscal year-end 2015 and 2014 metrics. Going forward, Fitch believes leverage  will range between 1x and 1.4x during the ratings horizon after consideration  for a modest increase in debt levels related to the higher level of share  repurchases. SHAREHOLDER RETURNS Fitch expects that Disney will manage the level of share repurchase activity in  a manner consistent with its current ratings and acknowledges that the company's  share repurchases and M&A; activity will likely exceed FCF generation. Fitch  anticipates share repurchases to range between $6 billion and $8 billion during  fiscal 2016. Disney repurchased approximately 21.2 million shares of its common  stock for approximately $2.4 billion during its first quarter of fiscal 2016. As  of Jan. 2, 2016, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase  approximately 334 million additional shares.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.  However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more  conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary  actions of Disney's management rather than by operating performance, reflecting  the company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase  leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will  likely lead to a negative rating action. LIQUIDITY Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and is  supported by significant FCF generation as well as $6 billion of aggregate  available borrowing capacity (as of Jan. 2, 2016) under three credit facilities.  Commitments under these credit facilities support the company's $6 billion CP  program and expire during March 2017 ($1.5 billion), March 2019 ($2.25 billion)  and March 2021 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had approximately $4.3  billion of cash on hand as of Jan. 2, 2016. Scheduled maturities are well  laddered and manageable considering FCF generation expectations and access to  capital markets.  Disney has approximately $2 billion of debt that isscheduled to mature during  fiscal 2016 ($500 matured during Dec. 2015) followed by $2.2 billion and $1.8  billion during fiscal 2017 and 2018 respectively. Fitch does not expect debt  reduction going forward. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Total debt as of Jan. 2, 2016 was approximately $18.9 billion and consisted of: --$4.3 billion of commercial paper (CP); --$13.4 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from February  2016 - 2093; --$532 million of debt related to international theme parks, which is  non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption  that the company would back the loan payments;  --Approximately $667 million of foreign currency-denominated debt (as of FYE15),  including the debt related to the acquisition of UTV. Fitch affirms Disney's ratings as follows: The Walt Disney Company --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Senior unsecured revolvers at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of  any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats  the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the  absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney  Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch  does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'  category-investment grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial policies  and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney Company.  Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if it perceived  heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade (where  Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

1119,DIS,"Saban, Disney invest in digital content firm Playbuzz","TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Playbuzz, a U.S.-Israeli platform for distributing online content, has raised $15 million in funding led by Saban Ventures, with participation from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). Existing investors 83North, Carmel Ventures and FirstTime Ventures also participated in the funding, which follows a $16 million investment round last year. Playbuzz said on Thursday it will use the money to develop its platform and expand its sponsored-content business, which works with companies such as Pizza Hut, Unilever and Ford to create advertising campaigns.  Playbuzz is used by thousands of publishers such as Time, USA Today, the Daily Telegraph and HBO to create content in new formats to boost audience engagement. “People are becoming impatient and don’t read a lot today. Traditional media is usually long-form articles or video and they don’t make sense in an era where people discover content on a four-inch screen,” Shaul Olmert, Playbuzz’s New York-based CEO, told Reuters. While quizzes are the most shared format on social media, Playbuzz also provides publishers with slideshows, flip cards, galleries and lists. U.S. media outlet The Hill used its video snaps format to divide a video previewing a Republican party debate into segments, enabling viewers to skip to candidates they wanted to hear. UK newspaper publisher The Independent used a new format called swiper asking readers to agree or disagree with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn’s policies. Olmert said the average time spent looking at a traditional news article is less than 15 seconds compared with 3-4 minutes for Playbuzz-powered content. With 100 employees including 60 in Israel, Playbuzz makes money from sponsored content and began seeing revenue in the last quarter of 2015.  For example, American Express placed a quiz on UK media sites asked readers which family vacation they preferred and recommended places to travel. U.S. digital ad spending in 2016 will reach $68.8 billion, or 35.8 percent of total media ad spending, rising to $105.2 billion in 2020, according to eMarketer.  Olmert, the son of former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert, expects revenue this year to more than triple. Playbuzz competes with sites such as Buzzfeed, the Huffington Post and Vox Media for advertising, especially in sponsored campaigns. But Olmert notes they are publishers while Playbuzz distributes content for its partners on thousands of sites. The investment by Disney and media tycoon Haim Saban, who chairs Univision, is part of a partnership that will lead to new projects, Olmert said.

1122,DIS,Disney executive search may mean longer stay for CEO Iger: analysts,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief Executive Bob Iger could be asked to postpone his retirement a third time to help smooth the transition to a new leader of the storied media company, analysts suggested after Monday’s surprise resignation of Chief Operating Officer Tom Staggs. Disney shares fell 1.7 percent to end at $97 on Tuesday as investors digested news that the company was losing the person Wall Street considered the heir apparent to Iger.   The company, which owns TV networks, theme parks and a movie studio did not give a reason for Staggs’ exit but said on Monday that he would remain a special adviser to Iger through September. Staggs had never formally been identified as Iger’s successor, but his promotion to the No. 2 job a little more than a year ago had put him in the lead to become CEO after Iger’s scheduled departure in 2018. A source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters that  Staggs decided to leave after learning that the board was expanding its CEO search and he was not guaranteed to land the job.  The sudden move left Wall Street and Hollywood guessing about who would emerge as Iger’s successor. One name frequently mentioned as a potential candidate is Facebook (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who sits on the Disney board. Facebook declined to comment. An executive with experience in technology, even if they are from outside the traditional media business, would be a strong candidate to oversee Disney’s various units, said Umesh Ramakrishnan, founding partner at executive search firm Kingsley Gate Partners. “Disney will be missing out big time if they don’t get somebody with a strong digital background,” he said. “Its multiple businesses are now bound together by a digital thread. Being able to sell the product and serve it to the millennial generation is what’s going to determine success.”  While it vets outside executives, Disney’s board might be able to persuade Iger to extend his contract so he can spend more time grooming a successor, analysts said. “We think Iger could potentially delay his exit if need be,” Cowen and Co analysts said in a note to clients. If Iger, 65, extends his term, it wouldn’t be the first time. He has insisted that he will retire in June 2018, although the board twice previously convinced him to extend his contract.

1124,DIS,"Disney expands search for new CEO, COO Staggs leaving","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tom Staggs, the veteran Walt Disney Co executive who had been widely seen as the media company’s next CEO, will step down on May 6 as the board expands its search for a successor to Bob Iger, Disney said on Monday. The unexpected move came little more than a year after Staggs had been promoted to chief operating officer, and about two years before Iger, Disney’s chief executive and chairman, is due to retire. A source with knowledge of the situation said Staggs, 55, had learnt he was not guaranteed the CEO job and that the board was going to broaden its search for a new leader. Staggs and the company mutually decided he should step down, said the source, who requested anonymity because the reasons were not announced.  Disney, which operates television networks, theme parks and a movie studio, said in a statement that the board aimed to evaluate a “robust slate of candidates.” Iger has led Disney to record profits and executed successful acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm Ltd. But he recently acknowledged subscriber declines at Disney’s sports network ESPN, raising concern among investors about how the channel would adapt to online streaming technology that is rapidly drawing viewers away from traditional TV. Disney’s board may have decided the company needs a new CEO with more experience in technology to navigate that change, Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said in an interview. “How do you transition to that five, 10, 15 years out?” said Diedrich, who recommends buying Disney shares. “There may be a need there for someone who has more experience with that consumer trend that is certainly here to stay.” Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who sits on the Disney board, has been seen as a potential CEO candidate. Facebook declined to comment. Iger, 65, has insisted that he would retire from Disney in June 2018, though the board previously convinced him to extend his contract twice after he announced plans to leave.  Disney’s shares fell 1.5 percent to $97.18 in after-hours trading on Monday. The company promoted Staggs to COO in February 2015 from his post as head of Disney’s theme parks and resorts and following a previous stint as chief financial officer. While Disney never referred to him as the heir apparent, his move into the No. 2 job put him in the lead to ascend to CEO. One of his biggest projects was the building of Shanghai Disneyland, which is scheduled to open in June. Staggs will remain employed by Disney as a special adviser to Iger through the company’s fiscal year, which goes through September, Disney said. He joined Disney in 1990 after working in investment banking at Morgan Stanley & Co. CFO Jay Rasulo, who had been seen as Staggs’ chief rival for the top position, said last June that he would step down.

1126,DIS,Disney COO's exit may see CEO Iger extending term again-analysts,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Bob Iger could end up extending his term for a third time, analysts said on Tuesday, following the surprise announcement that Chief Operating Officer Tom Staggs, a potential successor, will step down in May. Disney’s shares were down 2 percent in premarket trading, suggesting that investors weren’t overly concerned about that prospect or Staggs’ decision to move on after just over a year on the job. The media and entertainment company didn’t give a reason for Staggs’ exit but said on Monday that he would remain a special adviser to Iger through September. Staggs had never formally been named Iger’s successor, but his move into the No. 2 job had put him in pole position to become CEO after Iger’s scheduled departure in 2018. A source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters that  Staggs decided to leave after learning he was not guaranteed the CEO job. “...We think Iger could potentially delay his exit if need be,” Cowen and Co analysts said in a client note. If Iger, 65, extends his term it wouldn’t be the first time. He has insisted that he will retire in June 2018, although the board previously convinced him to extend his contract twice. In his 15 years as CEO, Iger has led Disney to record profits and executed successful acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm Ltd.  “To borrow a phrase, the best successor to Bob Iger may very well be Bob Iger,” Nomura analysts said in a note. Still, Disney’s shares have declined 6 percent since the beginning of the year. Iger recently acknowledged subscriber declines at Disney’s sports network ESPN, raising concern among investors about how the channel would adapt to streaming, as customers move away from traditional pay TV services. “We think Mr. Staggs had been working to solve ESPN and ‘future of TV’ issues while COO ... but TV operations are unlikely to be disrupted by his departure,” the Nomura analysts wrote.

1127,DIS,"UPDATE 4-Disney expands search for new CEO, COO Staggs leaving","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tom Staggs, the veteran Walt Disney Co executive who had been widely seen as the media company’s next CEO, will step down on May 6 as the board expands its search for a successor to Bob Iger, Disney said on Monday. The unexpected move came little more than a year after Staggs had been promoted to chief operating officer, and about two years before Iger, Disney’s chief executive and chairman, is due to retire. A source with knowledge of the situation said Staggs, 55, had learnt he was not guaranteed the CEO job and that the board was going to broaden its search for a new leader. Staggs and the company mutually decided he should step down, said the source, who requested anonymity because the reasons were not announced.  Disney, which operates television networks, theme parks and a movie studio, said in a statement that the board aimed to evaluate a “robust slate of candidates.” Iger has led Disney to record profits and executed successful acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm Ltd. But he recently acknowledged subscriber declines at Disney’s sports network ESPN, raising concern among investors about how the channel would adapt to online streaming technology that is rapidly drawing viewers away from traditional TV. Disney’s board may have decided the company needs a new CEO with more experience in technology to navigate that change, Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said in an interview. “How do you transition to that five, 10, 15 years out?” said Diedrich, who recommends buying Disney shares. “There may be a need there for someone who has more experience with that consumer trend that is certainly here to stay.” Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who sits on the Disney board, has been seen as a potential CEO candidate. Facebook declined to comment. Iger, 65, has insisted that he would retire from Disney in June 2018, though the board previously convinced him to extend his contract twice after he announced plans to leave.  Disney’s shares fell 1.5 percent to $97.18 in after-hours trading on Monday. The company promoted Staggs to COO in February 2015 from his post as head of Disney’s theme parks and resorts and following a previous stint as chief financial officer. While Disney never referred to him as the heir apparent, his move into the No. 2 job put him in the lead to ascend to CEO. One of his biggest projects was the building of Shanghai Disneyland, which is scheduled to open in June. Staggs will remain employed by Disney as a special adviser to Iger through the company’s fiscal year, which goes through September, Disney said. He joined Disney in 1990 after working in investment banking at Morgan Stanley & Co. CFO Jay Rasulo, who had been seen as Staggs’ chief rival for the top position, said last June that he would step down.

1130,DIS,"UPDATE 3-Disney princesses, Star Wars propel Hasbro results","(Reuters) - Hasbro Inc (HAS.O), the No. 2 U.S. toymaker, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, driven by strong demand for “Star Wars” action figures and the addition of Disney Princess dolls to its basket of toys.   Shares of the company, which also makes the Monopoly board game and My Little Pony toys, were up 4.6 percent at $86.20 in premarket trading on Monday. Hasbro holds a number of lucrative licensing deals for making toys based on blockbuster franchises such as “Jurassic Park”, “Star Wars” and “Avengers”.  The company last year edged out larger rival Mattel Inc (MAT.O) for a license to make dolls based on Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) popular princesses such as Cinderella and Snow White. Hasbro began selling Disney Princess and “Frozen” dolls in the latest quarter, helping sales of girls toys rise for the first time in six quarters. The company expects sales from “Star Wars” merchandise this year to retain strong momentum with the launch of home entertainment versions of “The Force Awakens” in the spring and the release of “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” in December. Revenue from toys targeted at boys jumped 24 percent, driven by toy guns under the “NERF” brand and figurines based on “Star Wars” films.  Net income attributable to Hasbro rose to $48.8 million, or 38 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 27 from $26.7 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 16.5 percent $831.2 million from $713.5 million. Analysts on average expected a profit of 24 cents per share and revenue of $777.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Up to Friday’s close, Hasbro’s shares had risen about 25 percent over the past 12 months.

1131,DIS,"Oil falls on failed output freeze; Dow above 18,000","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Monday after producers failed to agree on a plan to curb global supply at a meeting in Qatar, while world stock markets rose and the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 18,000 for the first time since July. Shares of consumer companies including Hasbro (HAS.O) and Walt Disney (DIS.N) helped buoy U.S. stocks, while investors braced for a flurry of quarterly earnings reports through the week.  In Qatar, some 18 oil-exporting nations, including OPEC members, failed to agree to stabilize output at January levels until October 2016. A pact fell apart after Saudi Arabia demanded that Iran join in. Crude oil ended well off the day’s lows, however, with a strike in Kuwait slashing the country’s oil output by more than half.  Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $42.91 a barrel, after falling $3 earlier in the session, while U.S. WTI crude CLc1 closed down 58 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $39.78 a barrel, after hitting $37.61 earlier. Some analysts said they don’t expect oil to fall significantly more as a result of the Qatar news. “While a few forecasters may be dusting off some old $20 WTI expectations as a result of the Doha outcome, we expect solid support in nearby WTI at the $35 mark,” Jim Ritterbusch at Chicago oil consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates said. A recent rebound in oil and signs that the U.S. economy is slowly improving have helped stocks rally from a steep selloff earlier this year that had pushed the S&P; 500 down as much as 10.5 percent.   On Wall Street, Walt Disney rose 2.9 percent a share after its “Jungle Book” film dominated the weekend box office, while Hasbro jumped 5.8 percent after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.  An index of energy shares .SPNY rose 1.6 percent as crude prices pared losses.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 106.7 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 18,004.16, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 13.61 points, or 0.65 percent, to 2,094.34 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 21.80 points, or 0.44 percent, to 4,960.02.  MSCI's all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS was up 0.2 percent, while Europe's pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 closed 0.4 percent higher. Brazil's Bovespa .BVSP index fell 0.6 percent as a vote to impeach President Dilma Rousseff looked set to force her from office after 13 years of leftist Workers' Party rule. In the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies after the impact of oil producers’ failure to agree on a plan to curb global supply faded, boosting risk appetite. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.22 percent at 94.486 .DXY. U.S. Treasury yields rose as oil prices ended off their lows and as investors focused on next week’s Federal Reserve meeting. “Oil prices are going to continue to be very important to the market,” said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president in fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR fell 6/32 in price to yield 1.77 percent, up from 1.75 percent on Friday.

1135,DIS,Turner to launch streaming video service for film buffs,"(Reuters) - Turner Communications is expected to announce Tuesday that it is launching its own streaming video-on-demand service for film buffs this fall, according to a company statement reviewed by Reuters Turner, which is a division of Time Warner Inc, is the latest in a wave of media companies to launch its own over-the-top video service to accommodate the growing number of younger viewers who are cancelling cable subscriptions in favor or watching content online, a practice known as  cord-cutting. The new service, called FilmStruck,  will focus on independent, foreign, art house and cult classic films that people know and not original shows as streaming video providers, like Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, are increasingly doing.  Turner is partnering with New York-based film distributor, Criterion Collection, which until now had offered all of its 1,100 films through Hulu. FilmStruck will not only feature films like “Mad Max,” “Cinema Paradiso” and “Seven Samurai,” but also will have filmmakers’ commentaries, bonus content and stories about the films themselves,  Coleman Breland, president of Turner Classic Movies and Turner content distribution, said in an interview.   “We didn’t just jump into the fray and say let’s offer an SVOD [streaming video on demand] service,” Breland said. “This is very targeted and focused.” FilmStruck will be managed by Turner Classic Movies. The company hopes to announce pricing for the service within the next 60 days, said Breland. The service will be solely subscription-based and will not have any advertisements. Turner is launching its own streaming online service just months after reports surfaced that its parent Time Warner was in discussions to take a stake in Hulu, which is jointly owned by 21st Century Fox Inc , Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal.  The launch of FilmStruck is one example of what customers and investors should expect to see more of from Turner in the next several months as the company focuses on being more consumer-centric, said John Martin, chairman and CEO of Turner.

1136,DIS,Comcast buy of 'Kung Fu Panda' producer aids Asia strategy,"(Repeating for additional clients; no changes) By Lisa Richwine and Malathi Nayak April 29 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s planned purchase of DreamWorks Animation would increase the media giant’s foothold in Asia, particularly China, as it competes in an increasingly global battle for entertainment dollars. DreamWorks, producer of the “Kung Fu Panda” and “Shrek” franchises, was one of the first Hollywood studios to open a production studio in China. It formed a joint venture with local companies in 2012 called Oriental DreamWorks. The $3.8 billion purchase of the company founded by movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg is expected to help drive traffic to Comcast theme parks in the region, Wall Street analysts said. The animation studio’s relationships also could make it easier for Comcast to distribute content in China. DreamWorks has aggressively courted audiences in that country, which is the world’s second-largest film market and home to a growing population of city dwellers ready to spend on entertainment. This year’s hit “Kung Fu Panda 3,” for example, was the first movie animated in both English and Mandarin. When it opened in February, it set a record for the biggest animated film opening in China. “DreamWorks has done a very good job in building a team in China and learning the market,” said Larry Namer, president and CEO of Metan Global Entertainment Group, which produces entertainment content for Chinese audiences. “As far as the Hollywood entities go, I think they seem to understand the nuances of the market better than most.” Comcast’s plan to purchase DreamWorks was announced on Thursday and requires approval from regulators. From January through March, 37 percent of Comcast’s total revenue came from its content and theme park unit, NBCUniversal. Tapping into Asian markets could help that grow further, analysts said. But banking on Asia right now is no guarantee. China, the region’s growth juggernaut for the last decade, has seen its economic expansion slow dramatically over the last two years, and its first-quarter gross domestic product increase of 6.7 percent on an annualized basis was its smallest since 2009. Larger rival Walt Disney Co, however, is busy ramping up its presence in China. The company will open a $5.5 billion Disney theme park in Shanghai in June. And its animated film “Zootopia,” released in March, has grossed more at Chinese box offices over its theatrical run than “Kung Fu Panda 3.” NBCUniversal is building its own $3.3 billion theme park in Beijing. DreamWorks is a partner in an entertainment district planned for Shanghai. Universal Pictures opened an office in Beijing in 2014 and has consumer products staff in China. “I want to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to grow that market as aggressively as possible,” NBCU Chief Executive Steve Burke said Wednesday on the company’s quarterly earnings call, a day before the DreamWorks deal was announced. With DreamWorks in the fold, Universal’s parks could add movie characters like Shrek and Kung Fu Panda alongside Harry Potter and the yellow minions from “Despicable Me.” “They are borrowing a page from the Disney playbook,” MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said. “They will use these brands to drive traffic at their theme parks.” DreamWorks’ ties in China also may ease the way for more NBCUniversal content into the country, analysts said. Chinese regulations limit the number of films imported into the country each year, and the government’s censors often object to foreign entertainment content. NBCUniversal’s strategy includes building its presence in other Asian countries and around the world. In September, it acquired a stake in Universal Studios Japan, which helped drive theme park sales in the first quarter of 2016. DreamWorks also provides original TV content to streaming service Netflix, which is now available in more than 130 countries, but not yet China. The DreamWorks TV business is expected to generate $1 billion in revenue from 2016 to 2018, Macquarie Securities analyst Amy Yong said.

1137,DIS,New York businesses to cut trash by half in 'Zero Waste' plan,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 30 New York City businesses, including Whole Foods Market Inc, Walt Disney Co’s ABC and Anheuser Busch, have agreed to cut the trash they send to landfills by half by June, the mayor’s office said on Monday. The “Zero Waste Challenge” is part of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s ambitious goal to reduce the city’s waste output by 90 percent by 2030, through increased recycling, reduced packaging and composting. In 2015, the city’s sanitation department collected 3.2 million tons of waste. “We’re doing what we can to make recycling and composting as accessible as possible to New Yorkers, but everyone will need to do their part to make a more sustainable New York City a reality,” de Blasio said in a statement. “These businesses are leading the way.” New York, with more than 8 million residents, is the largest city in the Western Hemisphere to adopt such a far-reaching plan. Los Angeles has announced a similar plan to reduce its waste by 90 percent by 2025. Participants in the challenge, which began in February, have already slashed 60 percent of their waste, on average, using strategies such as stocking coffee mugs rather than paper cups and switching from filing cabinets to digital storage, de Blasio said. Nearly 13,000 tons of trash have been diverted from landfills so far, they said. The challenge also requires businesses that regularly have leftover edible food to donate it to collection organizations like City Harvest, which distributes food to homeless shelters. Businesses in the challenge include Citi Field and Barclays Center, the homes of the New York Mets baseball team and the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, respectively; luxury hotels like The Peninsula and The Waldorf Astoria; high-end restaurants like Le Bernardin; and the e-commerce website Etsy Inc.

The U.S. dollar fell 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies after rallying for six consecutive days, as investors looked to book profits. The yen rebounded 0.7 percent against the dollar, halting declines against the greenback as Japan has threatened to intervene on its strong currency. U.S. Treasuries extended their price gains after a strong government auction of $23 billion in 10-year notes. MSCI’s broad gauge of global stocks fell 0.4 percent. On Tuesday, the index climbed nearly 1.1 percent, its best session in about a month, while the U.S. benchmark S&P; 500 had tallied its best day in about two months. “I think a lot of the reason why the market is pulling back today is because we had such a huge rally yesterday,” said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City. “Traders are kind of pulling back their horns, taking a little bit of risk off the table, looking for a reason to take some profit.” The Dow Jones industrial average was off 189.09 points, or 1.05 percent, at 17,739.26, the S&P; 500 lost 15.39 points, or 0.74 percent, at 2,069 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 34.94 points, or 0.73 percent, at 4,774.94. Disappointing profit reports from Disney and Macy’s  hurt stocks, with Disney the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P; 500, and Macy’s weighing on retailers. “We’re getting a lot of news on U.S. consumers today and it isn’t good news,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. With first-quarter earnings season largely complete, S&P; 500 companies have mostly beaten analysts’ expectations, but profits are still estimated to have fallen 5.4 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.5 percent after two sessions of gains. Outdoor advertising group JC Decaux was among the worst performers after a weak outlook. The dollar fell as investors booked profits on a day with no major U.S. economic data. “The dollar’s bias hasn’t meaningfully brightened given deep market scepticism in the Federal Reserve firing an interest rate hike in the near future,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. Oil prices jumped after the U.S. government reported crude inventories fell unexpectedly for the first time since March, adding to concerns over supply disruptions in Canada and Nigeria. Benchmark Brent settled up 4.6 percent at $47.60 a barrel, while U.S. crude settled up 3.5 percent at $46.23 a barrel. Oil prices have recovered some ground after touching 12-year lows earlier in 2016. The Treasury’s 10-year note sale occurred at a high yield of 1.71 percent, which was below the roughly 1.73 percent level that the debt had traded at before the sale. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were up 10/32 in price to yield 1.7262 percent in afternoon trading, from a close of 1.76 percent on Tuesday. Spot gold rose 0.8 percent as the decline in the dollar and shares globally rekindled investors’ appetite for the precious metal.

Disney shares were down 4.5 percent at $101.82 after the company posted a rare earnings miss. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow, accounting for about 33 points of the index’s 120 points fall. Department store chain Macy’s tumbled 13.4 percent to $32.04, while watch maker Fossil sank as much as 34 percent to a six-and-a-half year low of $26.51 after the two companies slashed their full-year forecasts. Eight of the 10 major S&P; sectors were lower, led by the consumer discretionary index’s 1.57 percent drop. The index was on track for its biggest one-day fall in three months. The broader S&P; retail index was down 1.32 percent. “We’re getting a lot of news on U.S. consumers today and it isn’t good news,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “Wages aren’t rising and its quarters like these that show that the consumer isn’t too optimistic about the U.S. economy.” Macy’s weak earnings report also weighed on big retailers. Dow components Wal-Mart and Nike dropped 3.3 percent, while Target fell 5 percent.

Macy’s report dragged down other department store chains, with J.C. Penney, Kohl’s, Nordstrom and Dillard’s falling between 2 to 7 percent. Fossil’s report, coupled with Macy’s results, weighed on other luxury retailers such as Movado, which tumbled 10 percent and Michael Kors, which dropped 12 percent.

1146,DIS,Disney shares stumble as expectations outpace reality,"(Reuters) - For Walt Disney’s Peter Pan, flying was “all a matter of faith and trust.” Investors in Walt Disney Co showed a lack of both in the company’s stock on Wednesday. Disney’s shares fell 4.5 percent to $101.76 in morning trading and were the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average after the entertainment conglomerate’s quarterly earnings and revenue fell short of sky-high estimates. As expected, Disney did get a boost from the success of the animated hit film “Zootopia” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”. But its cable business continued to struggle, theme park attendance was weaker than expected and product sales fell, leading to first miss on earnings per share in 19 quarters. “We believe the nature of Disney’s franchises like Star Wars has resulted in expectations running ahead of reality,” Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar wrote in a note to clients.  Venkateshwar rates Disney “underweight” on valuation, with a price target of $89. Disney has a forward price-earnings ratio of 17.3, compared with an average 14.4 for its peers. Thomson Reuters StarMine’s intrinsic valuation model, which takes into account analysts’ EPS forecasts, indicates Disney’s stock should be trading at $98.12 - about $4 below where it was trading on Wednesday. “We are reluctant to pay a significant premium to the group average (and market) for Disney given that historical and projected growth rates have not generally been superior to peers,” wrote Cowen & Co analyst Doug Creutz, who maintained a target of $88 on Disney’s shares. RBC Capital analyst Steven Cahall, who has a price target of $103 on Disney, was also cautious. “...We’re concerned that it’s at peak earnings with “The Force Awakens” potentially setting an impossible comparable, and domestic parks running low on headroom with record occupancy, especially if U.S. economic weakness sets in,” he wrote. For Goldman Sachs, troubles in Disney’s cable business, which includes sports network ESPN, “underscores our bear concern about rising expectations.” Goldman analysts, led by Drew Borst, cut their price target to $109 from $111 - the only cut among brokerages tracked by Thomson Reuters. Disney’s disappointing results had little effect on shares of other media companies, such as Viacom Inc, Time Warner Inc and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. And some analysts saw the stock’s drop as a chance to buy. “Content is king and Disney is the king of content,” said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners, which holds Disney shares on behalf of clients. David Miller, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, termed the results a “rare blip” and said the stock’s weakness was “an outstanding buying opportunity.”  Up to Tuesday, Disney’s shares had risen nearly 8 percent since early March when “Zootopia” hit movie screens. The stock was up just 1.4 percent since the start of the year, though. Of 35 analysts covering Disney, 19 rate it “buy” or higher, 14 “hold” and two “sell”. The median price target is $113. Like other media companies, Disney, owner of the ABC network, has been hit by “cord-cutting” - the switch to streaming services from cable and satellite TV. Revenue in Disney’s cable networks business fell 1.9 percent to $3.96 billion in the second quarter ended April 2. ESPN subscriptions fell, and ad revenue also dropped, in part due to the timing of college football playoffs. Excluding items, Disney earned $1.36 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.40. Revenue rose 4.1 percent to $12.97 billion, short of Wall Street’s target of $13.19 billion. The bright spot was the movie business. Studio revenue jumped 22.4 percent to $2.06 billion, as “Zootopia” grossed nearly $1 billion worldwide.

Among the items on sale, which are coming from the collections of private owners, is one of the first dolls ever made of the anthropomorphic Mickey Mouse, one foot signed by Disney and given as a gift to a woman, estimated to fetch between $50,000 and $70,000, said gallery owner Mike Van Eaton.  “This particular doll was given to woman that he drove an ambulance with in 1917 in World War One. A lifelong friend of his, he gave her one of his most cherished possessions and he signed it on the bottom in French dedicated to her,” Van Eaton said.  A set of furniture from Disney’s office, designed by Kem Weber, is estimated to fetch between $60,000 and $80,000, while an original score of the first ever song written about Mickey Mouse is expected to fetch between $15,000 and $20,000. Disney co-founded an animation studio in 1923, which eventually grew into a feature film production studio with films such as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” “Bambi” and “Cinderella.” He died in 1966 aged 65.  The Walt Disney Company is now one of Hollywood’s top players, producing live action and animated feature fare.  The auction is centered on the history of the Disney studio, Van Eaton said. The items will be exhibited ahead of the sale from May 25 through June 17 at the Van Eaton Galleries.  “It wasn’t the films the made the studio so much, it was the merchandise, the marketing of the characters that really made Disney what it is today and that’s what we’re trying to show in this auction,” Van Eaton said. Other highlights from the sale include early original drawings of the first two Mickey Mouse cartoons, 1928’s “Steamboat Willie” and 1929’s “Plane Crazy,” expected to fetch upwards of $4,000.

1155,DIS,Wanda's Wang aims barbs at Disney ahead of Shanghai park opening,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The billionaire head of China’s Wanda Group said rival Walt Disney (DIS.N) faces high costs and other hurdles at its first mainland theme park opening in June, a rare public criticism that underlines rising tension as firms vie for the fast-growing entertainment market. The comments by Wang Jianlin, made in an interview with state television aired late on Sunday, pits him against both the iconic U.S. firm and its local government-linked partner, which owns a majority stake in the park. Disney’s $5.5 billion resort in Shanghai, a joint venture between the U.S. entertainment giant and Chinese state-backed consortium Shanghai Shendi Group, is slated to open on June 16. Wanda has been positioning itself as a direct rival to Disney, breaking ground on a 16 billion yuan ($2.44 billion) tourism “city” in southwest China last week and preparing to open another park in southeastern Nanchang city this week. “As far as the opening of the Disney Shanghai park goes, I’m sure that we will win out,” Wang said in an almost hour-long interview on state-run China Central Television (CCTV). “At Wanda I always say we want to ensure Disney is not profitable for 10-20 years in this business segment in China.” A Shanghai-based Disney official declined to comment.

1156,DIS,Wanda's Wang aims barbs at Disney ahead of Shanghai park opening,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The billionaire head of China’s Wanda Group said rival Walt Disney (DIS.N) faces high costs and other hurdles at its first mainland theme park opening in June, a rare public criticism that underlines rising tension as firms vie for the fast-growing entertainment market. The comments by Wang Jianlin, made in an interview with state television aired late on Sunday, pits him against both the iconic U.S. firm and its local government-linked partner, which owns a majority stake in the park. Disney’s $5.5 billion resort in Shanghai, a joint venture between the U.S. entertainment giant and Chinese state-backed consortium Shanghai Shendi Group, is slated to open on June 16. Wanda has been positioning itself as a direct rival to Disney, breaking ground on a 16 billion yuan ($2.44 billion) tourism “city” in southwest China last week and preparing to open another park in southeastern Nanchang city this week. “As far as the opening of the Disney Shanghai park goes, I’m sure that we will win out,” Wang said in an almost hour-long interview on state-run China Central Television (CCTV). “At Wanda I always say we want to ensure Disney is not profitable for 10-20 years in this business segment in China.” A Shanghai-based Disney official declined to comment. In the wide-ranging interview that also touched upon Wanda’s investment strategy overseas and interest in global soccer, Wang added Disney faced hurdles to win over consumers to its key animation characters. “We still haven’t seen a real craze here or a generation blindly following Mickey Mouse of Donald Duck,” Wang said.

1157,DIS,RPT-Mickey takes on the locals with Disney's $5.5 bln Shanghai bet,"(Repeats Sunday story with no changes) * 963-acre Shanghai Disneyland officially opens on June 16 * Out goes American Main Street, in comes Chinese zodiac garden * Disney cartoons face stiff local competition for young viewers * Disney will also face 2,500 rival theme parks planned in China By Adam Jourdan SHANGHAI, June 12 (Reuters) - As the opening of the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disneyland draws near, Walt Disney Co  has a challenge. The hold of rival Asian characters such as China’s homegrown Boonie Bears or Big Big Wolf means seven-year-olds like Li Yixuan have less time for Mickey Mouse and Friends. As Li settles on the living room floor for 15 minutes of cartoons before homework and bed, Disney doesn’t get a look-in this time, as his favourite animated hero, Ultraman Ace from the hit Japanese series, does battle with space dinosaurs. And as the number of competing theme parks in China soars, it will become even harder to win the hearts of Chinese children - and open the wallets of their parents - to fuel long-term traffic after the turnstiles start clicking on June 16. “When we get kids now to write down their favourite cartoon character, very few put down Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck,” said Song Lei, Hong Kong-based director at Animation-Comic-Game Group, the organiser of Asia’s biggest annual fair for comics, anime and games. “Instead it’s what is being broadcast on television, what they’re seeing in their day-to-day,” he said. That means the Boonie Bears duo and mischievous, super-powered pig GG Bond, he said. That’s not helped by a ban on imported cartoons during the late afternoon “golden hour” peak viewing time for children. China’s attitude to Disney is ambivalent, reflecting a clash between nationalistic sentiment and the desire for American-style consumption among the growing middle class. China’s military-linked PLA Daily warned of what it said was “invisible propaganda” in Disney’s “Zootopia”. Yet Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger got a presidential welcome from Xi Jinping in May, and Disney has been granted “special” trademark protection. And Disney is still enjoying a banner year at the box office in China. “Zootopia”, “Captain America: Civil War”, “The Jungle Book” and “Star Wars: the Force Awakens” are among the 10 most-watched movies of 2016, reaping more than $690 million in ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo. Characters from those films will feature at the Shanghai resort. “There are people that love Disney and those that don’t, for a variety of reasons,” said Chris Yoshii, Asia-Pacific vice president for AECOM and a member of the Themed Entertainment Association. He predicts China’s theme park market will overtake the United States in the “not too distant future”. But that’s by no means all Disney. About 2,500 parks are planned in China, including Japanese brand Hello Kitty, and there is already a “Dwarf Empire” in Yunnan. DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc.’s $2.4 billion DreamCenter and Six Flags Entertainment Corp.’s park slated to open in 2019 are among Disney’s U.S. competitors. Domestic rivals include Haichang Ocean Park Holdings , which plans to open the nation’s biggest marine park next year, and billionaire developer Wang Jianlin’s Dalian Wanda Group, which aims to unveil 15 in China by 2020 and five overseas. Wang says Disney will be no match for his “wolf pack” of parks. Disney did not immediately respond to request for comment, but it is betting on its years of experience running the world’s most successful parks, supported by its suite of movies, TV shows and merchandise. It will not want to repeat its experience in Hong Kong, where its smaller park lost HK$3.8 billion ($490 million) from 2008 to 2011, according to its Hong Kong government partner. The park turned a small profit from 2012 but fell back into the red last year. For its first foray into the mainland Chinese market, the company has tailored the new park to local tastes. Out goes “Main Street”, the idealised smalltown America at the heart of its other parks, and in comes a large garden featuring Disney’s take on the Chinese zodiac. It hired a retired PLA general to direct its Tarzan show at the park, and a mandarin-language version of the Lion King musical makes its debut at the opening ceremony. “Size, though, was very important because we wanted to make a very loud statement,” CEO Iger told investors in May. At 963 acres, the site has two hotels, a 100-acre lake and the biggest and most interactive Disney castle yet. Some characters also appear to have had a makeover, said New Boston-based Jim Hill, who writes a Disney fan blog. Mickey and Minnie Mouse are “softer and rounder”, he said, making them appear more similar to popular Chinese characters. Some things haven’t changed, though. Ultraman fan Li was among the more than a million people to visit the park during its “soft opening”, and he voiced a familiar complaint - waiting time for the rides. “All the queues were really long and winding.

1160,DIS,Over $5.3 million raised for Orlando club shooting victims,"(Reuters) - Corporate and individual donors have given more than $5.3 million to help victims of Sunday’s mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida by a gunman who killed 49 people and wounded 53, organizers of fundraising drives said on Tuesday. U.S. investigators were digging into what motivated Omar Mateen, 29, to attack the Pulse dance club in downtown Orlando, including whether he was inspired by militant Islamist ideology and reports that he may have struggled with his own sexual identity. Mateen, a U.S. citizen who was born in New York to Afghan parents, was shot dead by police after a three-hour standoff. The gay rights group Equality Florida set up a page on the fundraising website GoFundMe.com, which had collected $3.6 million from more than 80,000 donors online as of Tuesday afternoon. “We do not know the total costs for the victims of this horrific hate crime, therefore are working to raise as much as possible and disperse the funds as fast as possible,” Equality Florida said in a statement on the fundraising page. The group said it will work with the National Center for Victims of Crime to distribute the funds. A representative for Equality Florida could not immediately be reached for further comment. Separately, a campaign led by Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer has received donations including $1 million from the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), which hosts millions of visitors a year at its Walt Disney World Resort in the Orlando area, company and city officials said.  Eligible donations from Disney employees will be also matched by a gifts program of the Walt Disney Company Foundation, the company said. “We are heartbroken by this tragedy and hope our commitment will help those in the community affected by this senseless act,” Bob Chapek, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said in a statement.  Donations to the mayor’s OneOrlandoFund will be distributed through the Central Florida Foundation and will support non-profit organizations that are supporting the victims and their families, the Hispanic community as well as the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community, Dyer said in a statement on the Orlando city website. Aside from Disney’s contribution, at least $750,000 in other donations have been made to the OneOrlandoFund fund, Dyer said.

1161,DIS,Disney's China fairytale begins with $5.5 billion park opening,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co has opened the gates to its first theme park in China, prompting a rush from thousands of gathered Mickey Mouse enthusiasts to be the first to storm Treasure Cove, ride the Roaring Rapids or visit Disney’s tallest castle.     Disney’s largest overseas investment at $5.5 billion, the park is a bet on China’s middle class and booming domestic tourism. The U.S. firm hopes it will offset an otherwise lackluster international theme park business, better known for cash-burning sites such as Euro Disney. “This is one of the proudest and most exciting moments in the history of the Walt Disney Company,” chief executive Bob Iger said at the official ribbon cutting ceremony on Thursday, where he was flanked by Chinese government officials. Iger and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang read out letters of support from Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping. Not everything has gone quite to plan though. The opening gala - meant to be a bonanza of fireworks, live music and dance - was rained off on Wednesday night, while at Disney’s park in Orlando, Florida, a young boy was grabbed by an alligator and killed. Disney, though, sees China as its biggest opportunity since Walt Disney bought land in Florida in the 1960s for what is now Walt Disney World - the world’s most-visited theme park. With that in mind, Main Street has been replaced by Mickey Avenue to reduce the feel of Americana while attractions include the Chinese-style Wandering Moon tea house, a Chinese Zodiac-themed garden and a Tarzan musical featuring Chinese acrobats. Disney estimates 330 million people within a three-hour radius of Shanghai will be able to afford to come to the park: that includes Zhao Qiong, 36, who was one of the first visitors inside the park on Thursday with her 4-year-old daughter. “Since she was young, my little girl has always loved Disney princesses, so I wanted to bring her to the park to fulfill her dream,” she told Reuters. The iconic U.S. firm is already expanding the Shanghai site to keep the home crowd keen, in a country where competition from a plethora of local theme parks promises to be fierce. “There is actually construction going on this week. When we open we will continue the construction to expand what’s on the opening day menu,” said Iger, who first scoped out the seven square kilometer plot in 1999. “We have plenty of space to do that and we believe we’ve got willing partners ... We think we will probably do that sooner rather than later.” Shanghai Disney could also help lure more consumers to its hit films such as “Zootopia” and “Captain America: Civil War”, which are among the top grossing films in China this year. Disney, though, is facing intense competition from homegrown parks and domestic cartoon characters. Consumers also have an ambivalent attitude to its products, with some being skeptical about American values overriding Chinese traditions and culture. Iger received a presidential welcome from Xi Jinping in May, and Disney has been granted “special” trademark protection. But China’s main military newspaper has also warned that “Zootopia”, a story about a rabbit police officer in an animal city, was a tool for spreading U.S. propaganda and ideals. Furthermore, Disney will have to share the spoils with its joint venture partner state-owned Shendi Group, which has a 57 percent stake - a concession agreed during lengthy negotiations.  Shendi is a consortium controlled by four large government-owned companies: Shanghai Media Group; hotelier Jin Jiang International, controlled by the city of Shanghai; supermarket-to-department store operator Bailian Group, and property developer Lujiazui Development Group.

1162,DIS,Sheriff probe 'not criminal' in Florida Disney resort alligator death,"June 16 (Reuters) - The investigation into the death of a two-year-old boy likely drowned by an alligator at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida is ongoing but is not a criminal case, a spokeswoman for the local sheriff’s office said on Thursday. Police divers recovered the body of toddler Lane Graves on Wednesday from the man-made lake where he had been snatched by the alligator as he played at the water’s edge the night before, despite efforts by his parents to rescue him. “It’s still an ongoing investigation,” said Orange County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Rose Silva. “It’s not criminal in nature at this time,” she said, declining to provide further details on the probe. A Disney spokeswoman said late on Wednesday that the company will review the posting of its signs which ban swimming in Seven Seas Lagoon - but do not warn specifically about alligators. Disney spokespeople could not immediately be reached on Thursday for further comment. The boy was grabbed by the reptile at about 9:15 p.m. on Tuesday while his family, who were on vacation from Nebraska, relaxed on the shore nearby, sheriff’s officials said. His parents, Matt and Melissa Graves, tried to save the child but were unable to pry him from the animal’s grip. The father suffered cuts to his arm in the struggle. The boy’s body was later found intact underwater, and the presumption is that he was drowned by the alligator. The reptile that seized the toddler was believed to be between 4 and 7 feet (1.2 and 2 meters) long. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officials have caught and killed five of alligators from the lake to examine whether they were to blame. So far, none of the five has been determined to be the culprit. The incident, which prompted Disney temporarily to close the resort’s beaches, came ahead of Thursday’s opening of the company’s first theme park in China, a $5.5 billion project in Shanghai that boasts Disney’s tallest castle. Walt Disney Company shares were down about 1 percent at $97.07 in morning trade after last closing slightly up.

1163,DIS,"Disney faces PR crisis, risk of legal action after gator attack","LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - June was supposed to have been a triumphant month for Walt Disney Co theme parks, with the flashy opening of a long-planned resort in Shanghai and a new Florida attraction based on its wildly popular animated movie “Frozen.” Instead, the company is facing a public relations crisis and the possibility of legal action after an alligator snatched and killed a toddler at the Walt Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, legal and communications experts said. “When people think of Disney they think of magic, the unbelievable, and everything is going to be fun. This incident flies in the face of that,” said Sam Singer, a crisis communications manager who represented the San Francisco Zoo after a tiger escaped and killed a teenage boy there in 2007. The alligator tragedy unfolded on Tuesday evening, as many top Disney officials were halfway around the globe to launch the Shanghai park that had been in the works for 17 years. The company reaction was swift. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger called the boy’s family and publicly offered condolences. George Kalogridis, president of Walt Disney World, flew back to Florida from Shanghai. And a statement of sympathy from Kalogridis was posted on the official Disney Parks blog. The boy’s family has not said it will file suit, saying in a public statement that they are “devastated” and thanking “local authorities and staff who worked tirelessly” after the attack.   But the possibility of a lawsuit makes Disney’s response more complicated, experts said. “The more they say, the more liability they could potentially create for themselves,” Singer said.  “They are low key, contrite and helpful,” Juda Engelmayer, a crisis manager at 5W PR, said of Disney’s response. “That’s all they can do at the moment.”  Disney plans to open its “Frozen” attraction at Epcot next week as scheduled, a spokeswoman said, though it has canceled a press event to preview the ride.         Several legal experts differed in their assessments of Disney’s potential legal liability in the attack, but most agreed the company would have a strong impetus to quickly settle any case. They said one potential problem for the company could be that, despite creating an inviting beach environment with lounge chairs, Disney didn’t post specific warnings about alligators, instead posting “no swimming” signs. “These people are from Nebraska and I can guarantee never once did they think they were in any type of danger letting their child wade in six inches (15 cm) of water,” said Orlando personal injury lawyer Lou Pendas, who has represented individuals in cases against Disney. Disney plans to install new signs warning of alligators in the area, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Pendas said he could only recall one other alligator attack in the 45 years that Disney has been operating in Florida, in the 1980s when an alligator bit an eight-year-old boy, who survived. But, Pendas said, the rarity of such attacks did not relieve Disney of responsibility.  “This is unbelievably rare but could easily have been avoided by proper signage and perhaps building a retention wall to keep the alligators off the beach,” he said. “The law says you have to take appropriate steps to keep your invitees safe.” A Disney spokeswoman did not respond to questions about potential liability.  In a lawsuit that followed a 2009 alligator attack in which an Ohio man, James Wiencek, lost his arm while golfing at South Carolina’s Fripp Island Resort, defense lawyers argued that legal doctrine dating back to Roman times held landowners could not be held responsible for the acts of wild animals.  They also argued the danger of alligators in a coastal region of South Carolina was so well-known and obvious the golfer himself should have exercised greater care.  The case settled for an undisclosed amount before trial in 2013. Stanford Law Professor Nora Freeman Engstrom said that Disney had a duty to protect visitors from danger and that wording and placement of the signs would be carefully looked at if the case went to trial.  The company could argue that the incident was not foreseeable and that the sign was adequate, she said. But she predicted the case would not go to trial. “The bottom line is that they have a child whose body was snatched from the parents” as they watched, she said.  “I don’t think it is the kind of case where you want to be arguing the ... subtle details of law.” ",6172016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-alligator-disney/disney-faces-pr-crisis-risk-of-legal-action-after-gator-attack-idUSKCN0Z3039

They said one potential problem for the company could be that, despite creating an inviting beach environment with lounge chairs, Disney didn’t post specific warnings about alligators, instead posting “no swimming” signs. “These people are from Nebraska and I can guarantee never once did they think they were in any type of danger letting their child wade in six inches (15 cm) of water,” said Orlando personal injury lawyer Lou Pendas, who has represented individuals in cases against Disney. Disney plans to install new signs warning of alligators in the area, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Pendas said he could only recall one other alligator attack in the 45 years that Disney has been operating in Florida, in the 1980s when an alligator bit an eight-year-old boy, who survived. But, Pendas said, the rarity of such attacks did not relieve Disney of responsibility.  “This is unbelievably rare but could easily have been avoided by proper signage and perhaps building a retention wall to keep the alligators off the beach,” he said. “The law says you have to take appropriate steps to keep your invitees safe.” A Disney spokeswoman did not respond to questions about potential liability.  In a lawsuit that followed a 2009 alligator attack in which an Ohio man, James Wiencek, lost his arm while golfing at South Carolina’s Fripp Island Resort, defense lawyers argued that legal doctrine dating back to Roman times held landowners could not be held responsible for the acts of wild animals.  They also argued the danger of alligators in a coastal region of South Carolina was so well-known and obvious the golfer himself should have exercised greater care.  The case settled for an undisclosed amount before trial in 2013. Stanford Law Professor Nora Freeman Engstrom said that Disney had a duty to protect visitors from danger and that wording and placement of the signs would be carefully looked at if the case went to trial.  The company could argue that the incident was not foreseeable and that the sign was adequate, she said. But she predicted the case would not go to trial. “The bottom line is that they have a child whose body was snatched from the parents” as they watched, she said.  “I don’t think it is the kind of case where you want to be arguing the ... subtle details of law.” ",6172016,http://www.reuters.com/article/florida-alligator-disney/disney-faces-pr-crisis-risk-of-legal-action-after-gator-attack-idUSL1N1981ZN
1165,DIS,Disney to post alligator warning signs after boy's death,"ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, plans to install signs warning of alligators in the area where a 2-year-old boy was killed by one of the reptiles, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. Police divers recovered the body of Lane Graves on Wednesday from the man-made lake where he had been snatched by the alligator as he played at the water’s edge the night before. The resort had “No Swimming” signs where the boy was killed at the Seven Seas Lagoon, but did not specifically mention alligators. A source with knowledge of the situation said the resort now plans to install signs explicitly warning of the dangerous animals. The boy was grabbed by the reptile at the water’s edge at about 9:15 p.m. on Tuesday while his family, on vacation from Omaha, Nebraska, relaxed on the shore nearby, authorities have said. His parents, Matt and Melissa Graves, tried to save the child but were unable to free him from the alligator’s grip. A complete autopsy was conducted on Thursday afternoon on the body of the boy, which was found intact underwater. “The cause of death was ruled as a result of drowning and traumatic injuries,” the Orange County Medical Examiner’s Office said in a brief statement. It did not elaborate. Rose Silva, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, said on Thursday that a probe into the toddler’s death was ongoing, but was not criminal in nature.   The Graves family released a statement praising local authorities and adding: “Words cannot describe the shock and grief our family is experiencing over the loss of our son. We are devastated and ask for privacy during this extremely difficult time.” The aquatic predators often roll their larger prey beneath the surface until their victim stops breathing, experts say, and then stash the body away to eat later. Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief Executive Bob Iger spoke with the family by telephone on Wednesday and expressed his sympathies, the company said. Disney spokeswoman Jacquee Wahler said on Thursday that resort beaches that were closed after the attack would be off-limits to guests until further notice. “All of our beaches are currently closed, and we are conducting a swift and thorough review of all of our processes and protocols,” Wahler said in a statement. “This includes the number, placement and wording of our signage and warnings.” The alligator was believed to be between 4 and 7 feet (1.2 and 2 meters) long. Trappers killed and opened up five alligators on Wednesday for sign of the boy before his body was recovered. The trappers remained at the lagoon on Thursday after removing a sixth alligator from the water late on Wednesday in an effort to find the one that snatched the child, said Greg Workman, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.  The commission’s executive director, Nick Wiley, has said there is a good chance they have already captured the alligator in question. But officials said the search would go on until that was proved by forensic tests such as DNA studies, teeth measurements and comparison of bite marks. Workman said the commission also has wildlife officers on the scene around the clock. He said they are searching all day, but especially at night when alligators are more active because of cooler temperatures and less human activity. Disney shares gained 11 cents to close at $98.38 on Thursday. Its Orlando resort is the most visited theme park in the world, drawing more than 20 million visitors last year. The incident came ahead of Thursday’s opening of the company’s first theme park in China, a $5.5 billion project in Shanghai that boasts Disney’s tallest castle. The attack happened on a beach by Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, an upmarket property just one stop from the Magic Kingdom on Walt Disney World’s monorail. The hotel’s website - showing rooms starting at $569 a night before taxes - says guests can enjoy diversions such as “bask on the white-sand beach.” ",6172016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-alligator-child/disney-to-post-alligator-warning-signs-after-boys-death-idUSKCN0Z10I4
1166,DIS,Cars vs. Autobots: Disney sues China firms in copyright dispute,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co has taken three Chinese firms to court over concerns local animation “The Autobots” copied elements from Disney’s own hit movie “Cars”, as the U.S. firm looks to protect its drive into the world’s second-largest economy. A court in Shanghai held a hearing on Tuesday, a Disney spokeswoman confirmed to Reuters. The dispute was over “copyright infringement” and “unfair competition”, according to a notice on the Shanghai Pudong New Area People’s Court website. Disney is making a major push into China with the recent opening of a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai, its first on the mainland, while its animated movies including “Zootopia” and “Big Hero 6” have been big box office hits in the country. The iconic U.S. firm, however, faces tough competition in the market from local theme park developers, popular Chinese animations as well as counterfeits from merchandise to fake Disney hotels. Chinese authorities have promised to give Disney “special” trademark protection. “The Autobots” drew ire from netizens in China when it was released last year, with some pointing out similarities with Disney’s 2006 film “Cars” starring Owen Wilson and its sequel in 2011. “Cars 3” is penciled in to be released next year. Zuo Jianlong, the director of “The Autobots” for production company Blue MTV, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday he was “relaxed” about a potential ruling.  “Lots of people online have talked about plagiarism, but it seems from the legal side that the matter is quite clear - at root there is no plagiaristic behavior,” he said. “If you put the two films side-by-side to compare them, then you will know they are completely different.” Disney declined to comment further on the case. The Chinese film is about animated racing cars including main heroes K1 and K2, while Disney’s offering follows the story of legendary racing car Lightning McQueen. The three Chinese firms involved in the suit are production company Blue MTV, media company Beijing G-Point, and online content platform PPLive Inc. An official for Beijing G-Point, who gave her name only as Ms Cheng, said the firms had hoped to reach a settlement, but Disney had been opposed to this. She added G-Point was not involved in production, but rather in the film’s distribution. Reuters could not immediately reach PPLive for comment. China’s box office hit around 45 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) last year, and is growing fast, a lure for overseas studios to tap into the market despite a cap on imported films, censorship concerns and a rising challenge from locally made movies.

1170,DIS,Father of toddler killed at Disney resort says two alligators were involved,"(Reuters) - The distraught father of a 2-year-old boy dragged off and killed by an alligator at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida last month has said he was attacked by a second alligator as he fought to save his son. Matt Graves, whose son Lane was killed in the Seven Seas Lagoon at Walt Disney World’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa after being dragged off in shallow waters, gave details about the attack to a fire captain, the Orlando Sentinel reported on Sunday. The disclosure came via email messages obtained by the newspaper from the Reedy Creek Fire Department, in which Captain Tom Wellons relayed the father’s account from the day after the incident to his supervisors, the newspaper reported. Graves was en route to a hospital for treatment on injuries he sustained while trying to save his son when he shared “the horror that he experienced” as his son was being pulled into the water and “how another gator attacked him as he fought,” Wellons wrote in the email, according to the report. Assistant Chief Stan Paynter forwarded the email to Orange County officials to alert them about a second alligator. The Sentinel also reported that sheriff’s office spokesman Angelo Nieves had said on Sunday a witness also said he had seen a second alligator attack the father. Trappers killed and opened up five alligators the day after the attack before the boy’s body was found underwater and recovered intact. Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has had more than 240 “nuisance” alligators captured and killed over the past 10 years at its Florida theme park property, according to state records.

1172,DIS,Fitch Rates Disney's Offering 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt  Disney Company's (Disney) offering of benchmark-sized three-, 10, and 30-year  senior unsecured notes.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. The proceeds from the  offering are expected to be used for general corporate purpose including the  repayment of outstanding debt.   Fitch currently rates Disney's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'.  Approximately  $21.1 billion of debt was outstanding as of April 2, 2016, including $3.1  billion of commercial paper (CP). A full list of ratings follows at the end of  this release. Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain consistent and  within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated leverage of  1.2x as of the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended April 2, 2016, is in line  with fiscal year-end 2015 and 2014 metrics. Going forward, Fitch believes  leverage will range between 1x and 1.4x during the ratings horizon after  consideration for a modest increase in debt levels related to the higher level  of share repurchases. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Financial Flexibility: Disney's operating profile positions the  company to generate free cash flow (FCF) in excess of $3.5 billion annually  during the ratings horizon, which coupled with strong liquidity and solid credit  metrics provides the company with considerable financial flexibility at the  current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resorts segment  is expected to increase capital spending to approximately $5 billion during  fiscal 2016, which will temporarily hamper FCF generation. Consistent Financial Policy: Given the strength of Disney's underlying  businesses, strong liquidity position and Fitch's FCF expectations, Disney has  the financial flexibility to accommodate a higher level of share repurchases,  which are expected to range between $6 billion and $8 billion during fiscal  2016, in a manner consistent with its current ratings. Ratings incorporate  Fitch's expectations that the company's share repurchases and M&A; activity will  likely exceed FCF generation given strong liquidity and the current credit  profile. Leading Market Positions and Leveragability: Disney has a very consistent  investment strategy centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and  content that is leverageable across Disney's various platforms. Disney is  uniquely positioned, relative to its peers, to capitalize and monetize its  internally or externally developed franchises and brands, which in turn  strengthens the company's operating and credit profile and provides Disney with  a sustainable competitive advantage. Strength of Cable Networks: Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks, ESPN in  particular, underlies the company's ratings. Fitch believes that the top-tier  channels will continue to be a must carry for the distributors and are likely to  retain pricing power. Disney's operating profile benefits from the stability,  recurring dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation  characteristics attributable to its cable network business. Fitch expects this  segment will continue to generate a significant amount of Disney's cash flow. Credible Strategy to Address Threats: Disney's strong asset portfolio positions  the company to address the secular threats and opportunities presented by  emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience fragmentation  across the media and entertainment landscape.  Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial policy  over the ratings horizon. Fitch believes Disney maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of its business. In terms of  capital allocation priority, Fitch believes investing in internal opportunities  focused on organic growth, such as the company's investment in its various parks  and resorts worldwide and long term sports rights deals, takes precedence over  merger and acquisitions and shareholder returns. Fitch expects that Disney will manage the level of share repurchase activity in  a manner consistent with its current ratings and acknowledges that the company's  share repurchases and M&A; activity will likely exceed FCF generation. Fitch  anticipates share repurchases to range between $6 billion and $8 billion during  fiscal 2016. Disney repurchased approximately 42 million shares of its common  stock for approximately $4.4 billion during the first six months of fiscal 2016.  As of April 2, 2016, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase  approximately 314 million additional shares.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --The revenue growth within the company's cable networks business (Disney's  Media Networks segment) reflects the stability of the business and expected  affiliate fee increases. Fitch anticipates mid-single-digit affiliate revenue  growth.  --Disney's broadcasting business benefits from a stable economic and advertising  environment while incorporating typical political advertising revenue cycle.  Additionally, this segment will benefit from growing retransmission consent  fees. Revenue growth ranges between 2% during non-political years and 4% during  political years. --Programming expenses are expected to increase by high-single digits driven by  sports rights costs.  --Fitch assumes typical volatility within the Studio Entertainment, Parks and  Resort, and Consumer Products & Interactive Media operating segments.  --Domestic revenues grow faster than International revenues within the company's  Parks and Resort segment. Fitch incorporates start-up expenses related to the  opening of its Shanghai Disney Resort in 2016.  --Fitch expects low double digit growth within Disney's Studio Entertainment  segment this year due to the release of Star Wars and a strong 2016 film slate.  Theatrical revenues are slightly offset by a weaker Home Video release schedule  when compared to 2015. Home entertainment revenues will track the theatrical  success in 2017 and 2018. Television and SVOD revenues grow at a mid-single  digit pace while home entertainment revenues remain flat. --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes relatively flat margins  within the company's Media Networks segment as retransmission revenue gains  enhance broadcast margins while cable network margins remain stable reflecting  the company's ability to grow higher margin affiliate fee revenues at a similar  pace to increasing programming costs. Disney's pre-opening expenses related to  its Shanghai Disneyland opening are expected to be offset by strong domestic  operating performance leading to relatively flat margins within the company's  Parks and Resorts segment. Coming off a strong operating performance in fiscal  2015, margins within Studio Entertainment are expected to contract somewhat  during fiscal 2016.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.  However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more  conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary  actions of Disney's management rather than by operating performance, reflecting  the company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase  leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will  likely lead to a negative rating action. LIQUIDITY Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and is  supported by significant FCF generation as well as $6 billion of aggregate  available borrowing capacity (as of April 2, 2016) under three credit  facilities. Commitments under these credit facilities support the company's $6  billion CP program and expire during March 2017 ($1.5 billion), March 2019  ($2.25 billion) and March 2021 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had  approximately $5 billion of cash on hand as of April 2, 2016. Scheduled  maturities are well laddered and manageable considering FCF generation  expectations and access to capital markets.  Disney has approximately $1.5 billion of debt scheduled to mature during the  remainder of its fiscal 2016 followed by $2.2 billion during fiscal 2017. Fitch  does not expect debt reduction going forward. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Disney as follows: The Walt Disney Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'; --Senior unsecured revolvers 'A'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'. Total debt as of April 2, 2016 was approximately $21.1 billion and consisted of: --$3.1 billion of commercial paper (CP); --$16.4 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from August  2016 to 2093; --$818 million of debt related to international theme bark borrowings, which is  non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption  that the company would back the loan payments;  --Approximately $791 million of foreign currency-denominated debt, including the  debt related to the acquisition of UTV. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of  any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats  the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the  absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney  Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, we do  not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'  category-investment grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial  policies, and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney  Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if we viewed  there to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade  (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

1175,DIS,UPDATE 3-Hasbro beats estimates on strong demand for Disney Princess dolls,"(Reuters) - Hasbro Inc (HAS.O) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, driven by strong demand for Disney Princess and Frozen dolls and action figures based on “Star Wars” movies. However, the toymaker’s shares fell as much as 7.6 percent in noon trading on Monday, which analysts attributed to factors such as slowing sales of toys targeted at boys, inflated Street expectations and a near 30 percent runup in the stock this year.  Sales growth in toys targeted at boys - Hasbro’s largest business - dropped to 4 percent in the second quarter from 24-32 percent in the prior three quarters. The category accounts for more than a third of total revenue. The “sharp slowdown” in sales growth in the category was “worrisome”, Jefferies analyst Trevor Young said.  Chief Executive Brian Goldner said the category was hit due to a massive drop in sales of toys based on “Jurassic Park” and “Jurassic World” films and Hasbro would no longer make “Jurassic Park” toys from the end of 2017.  Revenue from toys targeted at girls jumped 35 percent as Hasbro benefited from demand for dolls based on Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) princesses such as Cinderella and Snow White. Hasbro acquired the rights to make these dolls in 2014 and started selling them this year. Hasbro’s quarterly sales beat analysts’ expectations by a margin of 2.3 percent, compared with 3-8 percent in five of the prior six quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data. Investors were getting accustomed to a big beat and this “straight down the middle fairway” quarter feels like a disappointment, Piper Jaffray & Co analyst Stephanie Wissink said. “If I was a long-term investor in this story, what happened today would not shake my confidence.”  Goldner said on a conference call that Hasbro would start shipping toys based on “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” in the current quarter. Dolls based on DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc’s DWA.O movie “Trolls” will hit the stores in August. Goldner also said Britain’s vote to exit the European Union had created some near-term uncertainty, but Hasbro was yet to see any negative impact.  The net income attributable to Hasbro jumped 24.6 percent to $52.1 million, or 41 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 26, while revenue rose 10 percent to $878.9 million. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 39 cents per share and revenue of $859 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Time Warner also reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as it signed up more viewers to its premium Home Box Office network. Its shares were up 3.5 percent at $78.40 in afternoon trading.  The company, which also owns the Warner Bros movie studio, is paying $583 million for the Hulu stake, executives said on a conference call. Other Hulu owners are Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O).  Time Warner has been trying to woo younger viewers and push into the online video market dominated by services such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon Prime (AMZN.O). Last year it introduced its own streaming service, “HBO Now,” and made its content accessible on Dish Network Corp’s (DISH.O) Sling TV streaming service, which offers a small bundle of channels.   “They want to ensure that the Turner networks have the broadest possible distribution without really compromising the traditional cable, satellite and telco channels,” said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan.  The investment also gives Hulu additional funding as it prepares to roll out a new live-streaming service, which is slated for early next year. Turner’s networks, including TBS, Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies, will be available live and on-demand on Hulu’s new service, Time Warner Inc said on Wednesday.

1181,DIS,"Disney beats estimates, buys video streaming stake to lure web viewers","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s quarterly profit and revenue on Tuesday beat analysts’ estimates fueled by movie studio hits, and the media company said it was taking a stake in a streaming video technology company to sell more content directly to consumers. Disney and other media companies are struggling with “cord cutting” consumers who abandon large bundles of channels sold by cable TV providers. In buying a 33 percent stake in video-streaming firm BAMTech for $1 billion, Disney is hoping to lure online viewers. It will begin with an ESPN subscription streaming service by year’s end. The service will not, however, include any of the content that appears on ESPN’s TV networks, Disney said. Disney has the option to acquire majority ownership in coming years in BAMTech, which was formed by Major League Baseball (MLB) and is separate from the league’s content business. The technology is lauded as some of the best in the industry and is used by HBO Now and the National Hockey League as well as baseball. The investment will help “allay investors fears about Disney’s relevance in a world where content is delivered online,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. “That said, I think it doesn’t do anything specifically to allay fears of unbundling” of cable networks,” he said. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger described the coming ESPN online service as complementary to its TV channels. Programming will include Major League Baseball and National Hockey League games already licensed to BAMTech, he said. “Our goal is to ensure that our brands, notably ESPN, remain strong, vital and relevant in a totally changed media landscape,” Iger said of the investment.  For the June quarter, Disney's movie and theme parks divisions topped expectations, although a rise in cable networks revenue and operating profit was slightly below Wall Street targets, according to FactSet StreetAccount. (For earnings graphic see, tmsnrt.rs/1MfhspW) Shares of Disney fell about 2 percent in extended trade. Revenue at Disney’s cable networks business rose 1.4 percent to $4.20 billion in the third quarter ended July 2, but missed an analyst consensus of $4.31 billion. ESPN — the company’s cash cow — drove the increase in cable networks operating income due to affiliate and advertising revenue growth, although the number of subscribers fell and programming costs rose. “The Jungle Book” and “Captain America: Civil War” fueled gains at the movie studio, with revenue increasing 39.6 percent to $2.85 billion. Operating income rose 62 percent to $766 million.   Revenue at its theme park and resorts business was up 6 percent to $4.38 billion.

1187,DIS,Disney names ex-Warner Bros executive to TV business post,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has hired former Warner Bros. executive Bruce Rosenblum as president of business operations for the Disney/ABC Television Group, the company said on Friday. Rosenblum’s responsibilities in the newly created post will include global distribution, affiliate sales and digital media strategy for the unit, which includes the ABC broadcast network, the Disney Channels and Freeform, Disney said in a statement. Rosenblum will start on Monday and report to Ben Sherwood, president of the Disney/ABC Television Group and co-chairman of Disney Media Networks. Rosenblum’s role does not include Disney’s ESPN sports network. The appointment comes at a time when TV networks face challenges from a shifting media landscape and increased competition from online streaming services that attract “cord cutters,” or people who cancel cable television subscriptions.  Rosenblum said a key part of his job will be working with Disney’s consumer insights unit to expand existing businesses and develop new ones outside of traditional pay TV distributors. “A big part of revenue growth for us will be working directly with the consumer, both from an advertising and messaging standpoint, and a distribution standpoint,” Rosenblum said in an interview.  “The assets are here. We are going to work to grow those assets and craft new ones,” he added. The new position will free Sherwood to spend more time working on broader strategy and on the creative side of the business, Rosenblum said. Sherwood took over the Disney/ABC TV Group two years ago and has had 17 people directly reporting to him.  “It has become more important than ever to establish a more efficient and effective operating structure,” Sherwood said in a statement. Rosenblum spent 26 years as president of Warner Bros. Television, one of the Hollywood’s largest producers of TV shows. His left there in 2013 when he was passed over for the job of running the Warner Bros. TV and film studios.

1191,DIS,"RPT-Twitter could take many forms, depending on new owner","(Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text) By Liana B. Baker SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - With speculation mounting that Twitter Inc will soon have a new corporate owner, the 10-year-old social networking service - which has long struggled to define its core purpose -may end up heading in one of several distinctly different directions depending on who ends up paying for it. Companies including Salesforce.com Inc, Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc’s Google have shown interest in Twitter, which is working with investment banks to evaluate its options, according to people familiar with the matter. With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming. It is not clear how quickly Twitter might approach a sale, but it is moving to formalize the process, sources have said. A deal is by no means assured in light of the company’s uncertain financial prospects and steep price tag - its market value is more than $16 billion after talk of a sale drove the stock up over the past few days. Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, speaking at a conference in Washington on Monday, declined to comment on possible sale talks. Salesforce.com, run by CEO Marc Benioff, is focused on cloud-based sales and marketing software; unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at businesses users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships. Salesforce.com already uses the Twitter “firehose” for its new artificial intelligence platform, Einstein. “It would give them the social graph and a better idea of how social media relates to its customers,” said Ryan Holmes, chief executive of Hootsuite, a private technology firm that helps brands and consumers manage their social media accounts. Holmes also said that if Salesforce.com owned all of Twitter’s data, it could have better insights into what sort of conversations companies such as airlines or telecom firms might be having with their customers and thereby gain more understanding of their business challenges. But many Twitter users - especially newer ones - are not active tweeters, which over time could limit the value of the data Twitter can provide. Salesforce.com could also likely gain much of the benefit of Twitter’s data from licensing its trove of tweets as opposed to buying the whole company. Salesforce.com investors are already spooked by the speculation it could acquire Twitter: its shares are down 6  percent since news of the company’s interest flared up last week. Twitter would fit easily with Google’s online advertising-driven business model. Ads could be sold across paid search, YouTube, display and mobile on Twitter - while filling a gap for Google, which has struggled with social media. “Google already has the eyeballs with advertisers. Cross-selling to the Twitter inventory could be an amazing play for them,” Hootsuite’s Holmes said. Google, which has expertise in monitoring its video service YouTube, would know how to deal with the tricky policy issues facing Twitter, such as abusive tweets and censorship. Still, such a tie-up faces potentially fatal regulatory hurdles, analysts said. In Europe, where the company has a bigger share of the search market than in the United States, the company is already facing two antitrust investigations. “Google could help Twitter’s user acquisition problem. The unknown is whether regulators in the United States and European Union would allow the transaction,” said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. Facebook Inc, meanwhile, has been trying to replicate Twitter on its own platform and could also face antitrust challenges if it tried to buy the company, Greenfield said. So far Facebook has not been mentioned as a potential buyer, but with its large cash reserves and penchant for surprise moves it cannot be counted out. Twitter’s foray into live streaming of National Football League games and its presence in news gathering could interest media companies such as Disney, which owns sports channel ESPN. Twitter’s presence on mobile devices could help any media company, all of which are struggling to find mobile growth, according to BTIG’s Greenfield. No media company has a mobile product with as much reach as Twitter, he noted. “The world of media is shifting to mobile and these newer platforms are becoming the future,” Greenfield said. Still, media companies do not have the best track record with social media. News Corp’s acquisition of MySpace in 2005 ended in disaster. And some question whether the media companies and top personalities that have been so important to Twitter would stick around if a rival media firm were the owner.   (Reporting by Liana B.

So far Facebook has not been mentioned as a potential buyer, but with its large cash reserves and penchant for surprise moves it cannot be counted out. Twitter’s foray into live streaming of National Football League games and its presence in news gathering could interest media companies such as Disney, which owns sports channel ESPN. Twitter’s presence on mobile devices could help any media company, all of which are struggling to find mobile growth, according to BTIG’s Greenfield. No media company has a mobile product with as much reach as Twitter, he noted.   “The world of media is shifting to mobile and these newer platforms are becoming the future,” Greenfield said.  Still, media companies do not have the best track record with social media. News Corp’s (NWSA.O) acquisition of MySpace in 2005 ended in disaster. And some question whether the media companies and top personalities that have been so important to Twitter would stick around if a rival media firm were the owner.

1195,DIS,UPDATE 3-Twitter shares plunge on report bidders are scarce,"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) shares plunged on Thursday as fears mounted that a much-anticipated auction of the social media company will draw minimal interest from potential buyers. With stagnant user growth and continuing losses, Twitter’s board agreed last month to consider a sale, and has told potential acquirers it wants such deliberations to conclude by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Technology website Recode reported later on Wednesday that Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O), long considered the most logical buyer for Twitter, and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) would not bid for the social network, leaving cloud software company Salesforce.com (CRM.N) as the only known suitor. Twitter shares fell as much as 19.2 percent to $20.10, valuing the company at about $14.2 billion. They closed 20.1 percent lower at $19.87. Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff has publicly expressed his interest in Twitter in recent days, but stopped short of saying the company had decided on a bid.  Analysts said he downplayed the possibility in a meeting with investors on Wednesday, sending Salesforce shares up about 4 percent.  “I’m not saying I’m buying it, but I’m not saying I’m not buying it,” Benioff said on Wednesday in an interview with the New York Times. Even at $20, Twitter shares are well above the $14 they were trading at before speculation about a possible acquisition began to emerge this spring. Many investors and analysts believe Twitter remains expensive for most potential buyers, but the company does not have a clear back-up plan if it is not acquired. Product initiatives under CEO Jack Dorsey, who returned to the company a year ago but also remains CEO of payment company Square, have borne little fruit. Large amounts of employee stock and options are also considered an obstacle for some potential bidders. The rationale for Salesforce bidding on Twitter is not clear, said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a note to clients. Buying Twitter would reduce the value of Salesforce shares by about $11 through dilution, while increased debt could cut another $9.50 from the stock.  Other potential bidders beyond Salesforce are taking a look at Twitter, CNBC said, citing sources. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has also been rumored as a possible bidder, though Recode reported that Apple would not move forward.

1196,DIS,US STOCKS-Wall St ends flat with eyes on payrolls,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes closed little changed on Thursday, even as declining names outnumbered advancers, ahead of job market data seen as key to determine whether the Federal Reserve will raise rates before the end of the year. Gains in crude prices gave support to the idea that the economy is strengthening, as did a report that showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week to a near 43-year low. The data comes a day before the payrolls report for September, expected to show the U.S. economy created 175,000 jobs last month. The dollar hit its highest since late July against a basket of currencies as the data reinforced the view the Fed may raise interest rates at its December meeting. Despite the currency’s strength, oil prices rose to a four-month high. Crude futures prices have risen nearly 15 percent over the past seven sessions. “Energy is a positive input, the bottoming in energy prices,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  However, he said, traders were in wait-and-see mode ahead of the payrolls data.  “It all is a prelude to the jobs number,” he said. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 12.53 points, or 0.07 percent, to 18,268.5, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 1.04 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,160.77 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 9.17 points, or 0.17 percent, to 5,306.85. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored decliners. About 6.32 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.1 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Twitter (TWTR.N) shares plunged 20.1 percent to $19.87 as fears mounted that a much-anticipated auction of the social media company will draw minimal interest from potential buyers. Technology news website Recode said Disney (DIS.N) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) would not bid for the company. Wal-Mart (WMT.N) dropped 3.2 percent to $69.36 and weighed the most on the S&P; 500 after the world’s largest retailer forecast flat earnings for next year. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Whole Foods WFM.O, which rose 4.9 percent to $29.33.   About 6.35 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.1 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

1201,DIS,Exclusive: Twitter to conclude sale deliberations this month - sources,"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc has told potential acquirers it is seeking to conclude negotiations about selling itself by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, according to people familiar with the matter. The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. It is the clearest sign yet that Chief Executive Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company’s future as quickly as possible. Binding acquisition offers are due in the next two weeks, and Twitter has already whittled down the field of potential acquirers, the people said this week. Salesforce.com Inc is in the running, while Google parent Alphabet Inc, and Walt Disney Co have also been contemplating bids, the people added. Recode reported on Wednesday, citing sources it did not identify, that Google would not move forward with a bid to acquire Twitter. It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the Reuters sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.    Twitter and Salesforce declined to comment. Disney and Google did not return requests for comment. With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming. Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news.  The company missed Wall Street’s sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company. It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Facebook Inc’s Instagram and Snapchat. Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures, even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly. Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as chief executive more than a year ago, has been part of Disney’s board since 2013. Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share. The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO, but have been on a steady downward trajectory since.

1210,DIS,"Foreign firms say UK profits hit by Brexit vote, weak sterling","LONDON (Reuters) - The drop in sterling and some weakening in demand following the vote to leave the European Union have eaten into the earnings of foreign firms operating in Britain, companies have been saying as they reveal their third quarter results this month. Firms including carmaker Ford, technology group HP Inc, Ryanair and Delta Air Lines Inc, said Britain’s vote to leave the EU, or Brexit, was forcing them to reassess profit targets, plan additional cost cuts, increase prices in Britain and curtail operations. Large listed firms are beginning to report profits for the July to September period — the first full quarter’s earnings since Britain’s June 23 referendum on EU membership, which sent the value of sterling to a record low against a basket of currencies. While many domestic-focused British companies have reported resilient earnings since the Brexit vote, foreign companies are suffering because the profits they make in the UK are now worth much less in dollars or euros. “Translating sterling back into their own currency is a negative,” said Ian Williams, Economist & Strategist at Peel Hunt stockbrokers in London. He added that if companies believed the drop would persist, it could prompt them to freeze or cut investments in Britain: “The question is whether they want to maintain the degree of exposure to the UK that they have done historically.” India’s Tata Consulting, which offers outsourcing services to UK companies, told investors last week that earnings were suffering after a drop in the value of the pound from 95 to 81 rupees. Toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker said it revised its estimate of currency impacts to reflect the weaker pound and U.S. Toymaker Hasbro Inc, which manufactures Disney character dolls, told investors on Monday it faced a $25 million hit from currency headwinds — primarily due to the UK pound — in the fourth quarter.  Irish budget airline Ryanair (RYA.I) cut its forecast for its profit growth this year to 7 percent from 12 percent on Tuesday citing the weaker pound. The weak pound has been celebrated as a boon for exporters, whose sterling-based costs are reduced relative to their foreign-currency revenues. But even foreign companies with export-orientated manufacturing operations in the UK have been hit.  Carmaker Ford which has engine-making plants in Dagenham and Bridgend said last month that currency and GDP weakness following Brexit would weigh on European earnings. “Brexit we think in the short term, [will hit Ford’s margins by] a couple hundred million dollars this year,” Jim Farley vice president for Europe, Middle East & Africa said at an investor presentation. “We think it’s going to be more like $600 million next year,” he added. Many foreign companies echoed comments from UK businesses which said they saw no major fall-off in demand from consumers post-Brexit. Yet some foreign companies selling to other businesses said they felt customers were now more hesitant to make big ticket purchases. “There is a sense of anxiety and that is still obviously continuing,” Vishal Sikka, CEO of outsourcing group Infosys Ltd.(INFY.NS) said on an investor call. Tata said it also saw weaker growth than it had expected before Brexit. Many foreign companies said they aimed to offset the lower value of sterling by charging their customers more. Peel Hunt’s Williams said the biggest Brexit losers would be those companies without the power to push through price increases. Luxury goods maker LVMH said it had increased UK prices by 5 percent twice this year, without any drop in demand. Ford (F.N) said it had increased prices by 1.3 percent, helped by the fact that rivals Peugeot and Renault had done likewise.  But even then, Ford said it only expects “some of that Brexit headwind” to be offset by this.  Companies said they were also responding by intensified cost-cutting. “Given the continued headwinds due to competition, foreign currency and market sizing, we are driving another set of productivity improvements in fiscal 2017,” Cathie Lesjak HP Inc’s chief financial officer told investors last week. A few are scaling back operations. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it was cutting capacity on Transatlantic routes. But for now, companies downplayed any imminent plans to slash UK investment and relocate plants or people to other countries.  Most said they were waiting to see the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU and what kind of access to the single market the UK will enjoy in future. “We’ve developed plans based upon various scenarios and we are going to have to wait and see how everything unfolds to know what we are going to do,” Paul Donofrio, chief financial officer of Bank of America, (BAC.N) said on Monday.

1211,DIS,UPDATE 2-Mediaset says Vivendi ends interim management accord over pay-TV unit,"MILAN (Reuters) - Mediaset said on Thursday Vivendi had told it in a letter that an interim management accord over its pay-TV unit no longer stood, prompting the Italian broadcaster to blame the French media group for paralyzing the unit’s operations. Mediaset said Vivendi’s letter, dated Oct. 18, sought to avoid further damage after Mediaset Premium TV was unable to make key investment decisions and prepare its subscription and football campaigns. The two companies have been locked in a months-long feud since Vivendi in July backed out of a deal struck in April to buy Mediaset’s pay-TV arm. Mediaset, controlled by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, said the letter came too late after Mediaset Premium had suffered “enormous” damage because of the organizational paralysis. “The main consequence of today’s formal letter is the implicit recognition of the validity of the existing contract,” Mediaset said.  Vivendi declined to comment. The interim management accord had been struck as part of the April deal which envisaged the finalization of the sale by Sept. 30. The French company, led by Vincent Bollore, backed away from the deal to give it full control of Mediaset Premium, part of Vivendi’s plans to create a European media giant.  Vivendi said on Wednesday it was no longer keen on finding an amicable solution to the dispute with Mediaset, which last week had asked a court to order the seizure of a 3.5 percent stake in Vivendi. The Italian broadcaster is also suing Vivendi for damages and is asking Milan judges to enforce the pay-TV contract.    According to one source close to the matter, Premium TV did not renew a contract to air two Disney channels after it expired in July and is cutting spending to a minimum on its advertising campaign for the Christmas season. “The impasse has already damaged them on the market and in the interim they will have problems with advertising and new investments,”  a Milan-based analyst, who did not want to be named, said.  Mediaset has lost 19.5 percent -  or 700 million euros from its market capitalization - since Vivendi’s change of heart over the Premium deal. On Thursday, its stock shed as much as 6 percent. Shares closed 3.4 percent lower at 2.62 euros. “The market has already shown it does not appreciate the prospect of a long legal battle with Vivendi,” broker ICBPI said in a report. A decision on Mediaset’s request to seize Vivendi shares is set for Nov. 8. The first hearing on the contract enforcement will be on March 21. But a final ruling, in a system which envisages up to two appeals, could take years.  The deadlock with Vivendi also raises questions over whether Mediaset Premium will be able to bid for two soccer TV rights tenders for Italy’s top Serie A league and for Europe’s Champion’s league which are due to be held in spring next year.  In 2014, Mediaset spent an estimated 700 million euros for the right to air Champions League soccer matches in Italy for the three seasons starting in 2015.

1218,DIS,Nielsen sticks with subscriber report challenged by ESPN,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The Nielsen ratings agency  on Friday reaffirmed a report about U.S. pay television customers that was challenged by Walt Disney Co’s ESPN sports network. Media reports said the Nielsen data suggested ESPN lost 621,000 subscribers from a month earlier. Neither Nielsen or ESPN released the numbers publicly, but ESPN questioned the accuracy of the findings. In a statement on its website, Nielsen said that an “extensive review” undertaken after ESPN objected showed that estimates of cable subscribers provided on Oct. 28 were accurate. Disney shares fell nearly 1 percent on Friday to close at $92.45 on the New York Stock Exchange. “This most recent snapshot from Nielsen is a historic anomaly for the industry and inconsistent with much more moderated trends observed by other respected third-party analysts,” ESPN said in a statement. The figures do not include people who subscribe through digital TV services and other new distributors, the sports network said. The future of ESPN has been a concern on Wall Street since August 2015 when Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger acknowledged “modest” subscriber losses at the sports network. Disney and other media companies are facing challenges from “cord cutters” who are dropping traditional TV subscriptions for cheaper online options. Analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group, which pays for access to Nielsen data, confirmed that Nielsen’s latest report indicated a drop of roughly 621,000 ESPN subscribers. But he said it was not unusual as ESPN has seen previous monthly drops of around 500,000 or 600,000 customers. Wieser also estimated that year-over-year declines stood at 3.1 percent, in line with the 2 percent to 4 percent drops seen since the start of 2014. “This has occurred as the network began to trade off high subscriber fees for greater flexibility” for pay TV providers, Wieser said in a research note. “We continue to believe that ESPN is experiencing low single-digit subscriber declines.” The Nielsen data also showed subscriber losses for several networks across the industry, Wieser said.

David Bergstein, chief executive of private equity firm Cyrano Group Inc and who was executive producer of the 2015 film “In the Heart of the Sea,” was charged in an indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan. The indictment also charged Keith Wellner, the former general counsel of Weston Capital Asset Management, whose hedge fund investors were defrauded by the defendants, according to prosecutors. Bergstein, 54, and Wellner, 49, were arrested at their respective residences in California and New York, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of investigation said.

The indictment said they also misappropriated some investor funds for their own and others’ benefit. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in a related civil lawsuit filed on Wednesday, accused Bergstein of misappropriating over $5.8 million to support an “extravagant lifestyle.” According to court papers, the case related to a probe of individuals including investment banker Jason Galanis involved in market manipulation for reinsurer Gerova Financial Group Ltd.

Executives said they expected modest earnings per share growth in fiscal 2017 and “more robust growth” in fiscal 2018 and beyond, as ESPN attracts more online viewers, the new Shanghai theme park lures visitors and the movie studio releases more “Star Wars” installments and other films. The company’s stock rose 2.7 percent to $97.25 after hours. Disney and media rivals face challenges from “cord cutters” who are dropping TV subscriptions for cheaper and more convenient online services, and the issue is especially important for ESPN, one of Disney’s most important brands.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.10 per share in the latest quarter, missing the $1.16 consensus forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares dropped immediately after the report, but revived after executives’ comments on growth in a call to analysts. “We are extremely confident that we’ll continue to deliver significant long-term growth,” Chief Executive Bob Iger said. The future of ESPN has been in focus since August 2015 when Iger acknowledged “modest” subscriber losses at the sports network.   On Thursday, Iger said the company had taken “a more bullish position on the future of ESPN’s (subscriber) base.” “To some extent, the causes of those losses have abated, notably the migration to smaller packages” that do not include ESPN, Iger said. New digital services “are going to offer ESPN opportunities they haven’t had to reach more people,” he said. The strength of ESPN has been a concern on Wall Street, said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.  “There is nothing in the release that changes investor views that ESPN is the struggling division,” Greenfield said. The company has been investing in share buybacks rather than addressing the problem at ESPN, he added. Disney expects to repurchase between $7 billion and $8 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2017, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said. Asked about the impact of the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, Iger said it was possible it could speed up work in Washington to lower the corporate tax rate, which Disney has advocated. For the September quarter, revenue in Disney’s cable networks business, which includes ESPN and the youth-focused Disney Channel, fell 6.8 percent to $3.96 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $4.13 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Nielsen data estimated that ESPN lost 621,000 subscribers in November - a figure Disney has contested. Disney’s movie business generated revenue of $1.81 billion in the quarter, up 1.57 percent, missing the average FactSet estimate of $1.84 billion. New releases including “Pete’s Dragon” could not match last year’s success with “Inside Out,” “Ant-Man” and “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” Revenue from Disney’s theme parks, resorts and cruise line business rose 0.6 percent to $4.39 billion. Four million people visited the new Shanghai Disneyland in the first four months, executives said. Operations should be “very close to breakeven” in fiscal 2017, McCarthy said. Attendance declined at Disney’s parks in Paris, Hong Kong and California during the September quarter, the company said. Net income attributable to the company, which also owns the ABC TV network, rose to $1.77 billion, or $1.10 per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 1, from $1.61 billion, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier.

1230,DIS,Fitch Affirms Symetra Life's IFS at 'A' and Holdco's IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Symetra Life Insurance  Company's (Symetra Life) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'A'. Fitch  has also affirmed the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Symetra Financial  Corporation (Symetra) at 'A-' and the ratings of all outstanding debt. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end  of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Symetra's ratings reflect its strong balance sheet, diversified earnings,  moderate financial leverage. Additional strengths include the company's strong  competitive position in the group medical stop-loss market and fixed annuities  sold through banks. The ratings also reflect its above-average interest rate  risk.  The ratings consider Symetra's status as a wholly-owned subsidiary of  Japan-based Sumitomo Life Insurance Company (Sumitomo). Fitch rates Sumitomo's  IFS and IDR at 'A' with a Negative Outlook. Sumitomo's IFS rating is currently  constrained by Japan's Long-Term Local Currency IDR ('A'/Outlook Negative), and  is one notch below its unadjusted IFS rating of 'A+'.  Based on Fitch's criteria, Symetra's strategic importance level is 'Very  Important' within the Sumitomo enterprise, reflecting its position as its  parent's U.S. platform. This along with its standalone credit profile, which  Fitch views as in line with an 'A' IFS rating, results in Symetra Life carrying  the same IFS rating as Sumitomo. In the event of a one notch downgrade to the  Japanese sovereign rating, Fitch would likely affirm Symetra's ratings, due to  its lack of direct exposure to Japan and the issues constraining its sovereign  rating. The standalone credit profile also considers Symetra's exposure to the  protracted low interest rate environment. Fitch believes that with its liability  mix, particularly its large legacy structured settlement and bank owned life  insurance book, Symetra is more exposed to interest rate risk than peers.  Fitch views Symetra Life's risk-adjusted capital as strong for the rating and  considers the growth in statutory surplus adequate. The company's RBC ratio  decreased in 1H16 to an estimated 411% from 424% as of year-end 2015. However,  RBC remains both strong for the rating level and above management's target of  350%. Symetra's Prism capital model score in 2015 was 'Strong', which is  consistent with the rating level.  Symetra's financial leverage declined to 16% as of June 30, 2016, largely due to  purchase accounting adjustments whereby shareholders' equity was set equal to  Sumitomo's purchase price, leading to a $1.3 billion increase in shareholders'  equity, excluding net unrealized gains, from year-end 2015. Fitch views the  company's use of financial leverage as reasonable considering its profile and  rating level. Total financings and commitments (TFC) remains modest at 0.3x.  Through June 30, 2016, Symetra's post-tax operating income was $23.8 million,  down from the prior year as a result of purchase accounting adjustments. The  benefits division loss ratio increased to 71% in Q2'16 from 66% in the prior  year period due to higher severity and increased frequency of claims. Fixed  indexed annuity sales remain strong, but could face headwinds from the  Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. Margin compression persists in the  protracted low interest rate environment.  Symetra's risky asset ratio of 71% remained below the industry (80%) at year-end  2015, due to its below-average Schedule BA exposure, which is partially offset  by its above-average common stock exposure. The company's bond portfolio is  overweight 'BBB' rated bonds, but its exposure to below investment grade bonds  is in line with the industry. Commercial mortgages comprise 16% of its invested  assets, moderately above the industry's 11%, but the portfolio is of high  quality and considered a good match for its long-dated liabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Symetra Life's IFS rating could be upgraded one notch above Sumitomo's IFS  rating if its standalone credit profile improved to 'A+'. As a 'Very Important'  subsidiary of Sumitomo, Symetra Life's IFS rating could also be upgraded in  conjunction with an upgrade of the parent. Given that Sumitomo's ratings have a  Negative Outlook, an upgrade of Symetra Life for this reason is unlikely in the  near term. In the event of a one notch downgrade of the parent's IFS rating to  'A-', Symetra Life could maintain its current 'A' IFS rating per Fitch's  criteria. As a 'Very Important' subsidiary of Sumitomo, Symetra Life's IFS  rating could be downgraded below the parent's IFS rating if its standalone  assessment is downgraded by three or more notches.  Symetra's holding company ratings are somewhat constrained by Sumitomo's  ratings, which are capped by Japan's Long-Term Local-Currency IDR of 'A'.  Therefore, a two notch upgrade of Sumitomo's IFS rating would be needed to  upgrade Symetra's holding company ratings. Conversely, if Sumitomo's ratings  were downgraded by more than one notch, based on its own credit quality, or  deterioration in Japan's sovereign rating, Symetra's holding company ratings  will also likely be lowered in conjunction with its parent.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Symetra Financial Corp.  --IDR at 'A-'; --4.25% senior unsecured notes due July 15, 2024 at 'BBB+'; --8.3% junior subordinated CENts due Oct. 15, 2067 at 'BBB-'.

1231,DIS,Hong Kong Disneyland to expand with $1.4 billion investment,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Walt Disney (DIS.N) will expand its loss-making Hong Kong Disneyland theme park with a $1.4 billion investment to try to attract more visitors, the U.S. entertainment company and its local government partner said on Tuesday. Hong Kong Disneyland, the firm’s smallest park, has been hit by weak local retail and tourism markets and suffered its first loss in four years in 2015. It cut an unspecified number of jobs  earlier this year. The Hong Kong resort also faces competition from other theme park operators fighting for mainland Chinese visitors, including Dalian Wanda, which plans to spend billions of dollars to launch at least 20 tourism parks in China. The Hong Kong government, which owns a 53 percent stake in the theme park, will chip in $750 million, while Disney will pay approximately $650 million for the expansion running from 2018 to 2023. The Hong Kong resort will add Frozen and Marvel themed areas — attractions that it hopes can help differentiate it from other parks around the world, including a Shanghai Disneyland opened in June this year. Disney said this month that attendance had declined at its parks in Hong Kong, Paris and California during the most recent quarter, while four million people visited Shanghai Disneyland in its first four months. Hong Kong’s retail and tourism industries have been ailing. The city saw a 6.1 percent decrease in the number of tourists in the first nine months this year, including a bigger drop from mainland China, according to official tourist board data. “Everybody knows tourism in the region, especially in Hong Kong, has been challenging, so it’s not just Hong Kong Disneyland,” Samuel Lau, managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland said at a press conference announcing the plan. “We need to quickly double up to make sure we invest in tourism in the long run. Some of these projects will take time to build and create, and now is the time.” Disney said the expansion will create 3,500 jobs andeventually bring another 600 jobs within the park. Hong Kong Disneyland employed more than 5,300 full time and 2,500 part time staff, making it one of Hong Kong’s largest employers, according to its Annual Business Review for fiscal year 2015.

1234,DIS,Disney will create shows for Snapchat,"(Reuters) - The Walt Disney Company’s U.S. television arm will create shows for Snap Inc’s Snapchat, Disney announced on Wednesday, in Snapchat’s latest deal with a major U.S. media company. Financial terms were not disclosed.  Snap, which is preparing for next year’s initial public offering, has signed a variety of advertising and content agreements this year with Viacom, Comcast’s NBCUniversal and Time Warner Inc’s Turner Broadcasting System Inc. Media companies such as Disney partner with Snapchat in an effort to reach the type of younger viewers the social media company targets, which increasingly eschew traditional television. The two had previously worked together for a special Live Stories, a Snapchat feature that curates user-submitted photos and videos tied to a specific event, around ABC’s broadcast of the Academy Awards in February. Unlike in Snapchat’s other deals with media companies, where any ad sales responsibilities would be shared across both companies, Disney will control and sell all advertising for the shows it produces for Snapchat. The agreement with the Disney-ABC Television Group, which includes the ABC broadcast network and cable channel Freeform, begins in January with a series around ABC’s popular “The Bachelor” franchise. The recap series, “Watch Party: The Bachelor” will debut Jan. 3, a day after the ABC show begins its 21st season.  Future shows based on other Disney-ABC properties will roll out on Snapchat later. “Earlier this year, we worked closely with Snap on a very successful The Oscars Live Story and we look forward to building on that relationship and providing Snapchat’s mobile-centric users with a unique, immersive experience around our shows and brands,” Disney-ABC Television executive John Frelinghuysen said in a statement.

1235,DIS,"Tyrus Wong, pioneer 'Bambi' artist, dies at 106","LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Tyrus Wong, whose paintings served as visual inspiration for Disney’s animated classic “Bambi,” died Friday, Dec. 30. He was 106. Wong’s death was announced on his Facebook page. “With heavy hearts, we announce the passing of Tyrus Wong,” the post read. “Tyrus died peacefully at his home surrounded by his loving daughters Kim, Kay and Tai-Ling. He was 106 years old.” Wong was born in China before immigrating to the Bay Area at age 9. From there he went to art school on a scholarship followed by accepting a low-level animation job in 1938. After hearing about Walt Disney’s “Bambi” project he put together some paintings of deer in a forest, which impressed Disney enough to use them as inspiration for the film. The animated classic isn’t all Wong is known for though, he’s also worked on film’s like “Rebel Without a Cause, “The Green Berets,” and “The Wild Bunch.” In 2001, Wong was named a Disney Legend, and in 2013 he had his artwork featured in the Walt Disney Family Museum. In October of this year Wong received two honors at the Asian World Film Festival. He was awarded with a lifetime achievement award on the opening day with the following day (his 106th birthday) being the screening of the documentary about him titled “Tyrus” directed by Pam Tom. Nelson Coates, the president of the Art Directors Guild commented, “On behalf of the Art Directors Guild, I am very saddened to share news of the loss of our highly talented friend, Tyrus Wong. His work and life inspired so many of us with his passion, originality, and creativity. Deepest condolences are extended to his family and many friends at this time.” According to the statement, the Art Directors Guild will present a tribute to Mr. Wong at its awards ceremony on Feb 11. Wong is survived by his daughters Kim, Kay and Tai-Ling.",12312016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-variety-entertainment-film-news/tyrus-wong-pioneer-bambi-artist-dies-at-106-idUSKBN14K0MU

1243,DIS,"Despite overtime finish, NFL Super Bowl draws lower TV ratings","(Reuters) - Fox Television’s broadcast of Super Bowl LI on Sunday night drew 111.3 million viewers, according to Nielsen data released by the network on Monday, the smallest audience for the National Football League’s title game in four years. The contest included a thrilling finish, with the New England Patriots staging a comeback to defeat the Atlanta Falcons in the National Football league’s first-ever Super Bowl overtime. The Patriots returned from a 25-point deficit and quarterback Tom Brady, 39, won his record fifth championship. The Falcons were in control for much of the game, with a 28-3 lead midway through the third quarter. Viewership surged as the Patriots’ pushed the game into overtime, peaking at 117.7 million from 10 p.m. to 10:15 p.m ET. Without the Patriots’ rally, ratings would’ve been even worse for Fox, which still posted the least-viewed Super Bowl since 2013, when 108.7 million watched the Baltimore Ravens defeat the San Francisco 49ers.  Lady Gaga’s halftime show drew 117.5 million viewers. Last year’s Super Bowl drew a 111.9 million viewers to CBS Corp’s (CBS.N) CBS, while the Patriots’ previous title game appearance in 2015 helped Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBC television draw 114.4 million viewers, the most-watched TV broadcast in U.S. history. Despite the lower viewership, the brief overtime, in which the Patriots scored a touchdown in their first possession, allowed Fox to add four more commercials. It is not clear how many more ad dollars Fox was able to get; the network was charging $5 million for 30-seconds of airtime during the game. Fox brought in an estimated $509.6 million in ad revenue for the broadcast, according to research firm iSpot.TV.  Advertising took up 23 percent of the broadcast, with 51 minutes and 30 seconds of commercials. That made it the second-most ad-cluttered Super Bowl game, according to ad-tracking firm Kantar Media. The four-year viewership low comes on the heels of a disappointing NFL season that saw ratings decline 9 percent and another 6 percent through the playoffs leading up to the Super Bowl. The NFL’s four U.S. TV partners, Fox, NBC, CBS and Walt Disney Co’s ESPN, are collectively paying $5.4 billion per year under their current media rights contracts. Much of the ratings decline during the season was blamed on the contentious U.S. presidential election drawing interest away, as well as the lackluster quality of play early in the season. Prior to the Nov. 8 election, ratings were down 12 percent, but were only off by 5 percent after, according to analysis by MoffettNathanson.

1244,DIS,Disney CEO Iger says he is open to extending his term,"(Reuters) - Chief Executive Bob Iger said on Tuesday he is open to extending his term as the head of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), offering investors a sign of potential stability at the media company as it reported a dip in quarterly advertising at ESPN. Investor favorite Iger’s current contract ends in June 2018, and shareholders are eager that he is replaced by a steady pair of hands. In Iger’s 12 years at the helm of Disney, the company’s shares have more than tripled in value, compared to roughly a doubling of the S&P; 500.    During a conference call on Tuesday, Iger said he was confident a successor would be chosen “on a timely basis.” He added that he would consider extending his term “if it is in the best interest of the company.” It would not be the first time Iger has extended his stay in office. He originally announced plans to retire in April 2015, agreed to stay on through June 2016, then later agreed to remain until June 2018.  “The fear was (investors) had no idea who is going to step in, and so Bob Iger staying is probably is exactly what investors wanted to hear,” BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said. In its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday, Disney posted lower-than-expected revenue for October to December, hurt by the drop in advertising revenue at ESPN and an unfavorable comparison in the movie business due to the record success of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” a year earlier. Shares initially fell more than 2 percent after the quarterly report but regained some ground after Iger’s comments about his future. They were down about 0.5 percent in after-hours trading. The unexpected revenue drop overshadowed Disney’s profit, which topped Wall Street expectations. Excluding items, the company earned $1.55 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.49. Profit was lifted by a 13 percent increase from Disney’s international and domestic theme parks.  Investors, however, have closely scrutinized sports juggernaut ESPN since a disclosure of subscriber losses in 2015 amid “cord cutting” by people who drop pay TV subscriptions. For the December quarter, the network reported a rise in programming costs that may have been bigger than Wall Street expected, Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said: “That could be a disappointment for shareholders.”  It also reported lower advertising revenue, in part from the timing of college football bowl games. ESPN aired three fewer playoff broadcasts in the quarter compared to a year ago. The company’s total revenue fell 3 percent from a year ago to $14.78 billion in the quarter that ended Dec. 31.  Analysts on average had expected revenue to rise slightly to $15.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue in Disney’s cable networks business, which includes ESPN and the Disney Channels, fell 2.1 percent to $4.43 billion. Operating income dropped 4 percent to $1.4 billion. At the movie studio, “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” took in more than $1 billion at global box offices but could not match the $2 billion from “Force Awakens” a year earlier. Operating income at the movie unit fell 17 percent to $842 million. The company in November promised earnings per share growth from this fiscal year onwards, betting ESPN would attract more online viewers and the new Shanghai theme park would lure visitors and on its new movie releases. Net income attributable to Disney dropped to $2.48 billion, or $1.55 per share, from $2.88 billion, or $1.73 per share, a year earlier.

1247,DIS,Walt Disney seeks control of troubled offspring Euro Disney,"DOHA/PARIS (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is to seek full control of Euro Disney EDLP.PA after raising its stake in the underperforming operator of Disneyland Paris through a deal with Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 and has struggled financially for much of that time, after making overly optimistic visitor projections and taking on too much debt. It sits on a 5,510-acre site about 20 miles east of Paris, only about half of which has been developed so far, Disney said in its 2016 annual report. Disney said on Friday it was offering 2 euros a share for any remaining shares in Euro Disney after buying a 9 percent stake from Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holdings via a share swap, increasing its holding in the European company to 85.7 percent from 76.7 percent. If it gets to at least 95 percent it will buy out and delist the shares from the Euronext Paris stock exchange, it added. The offer represents a 67 percent premium to the closing price of Euro Disney shares on Thursday. Minority shareholders have long complained about the way the company was run and Disney could face resistance to the offer despite the premium. Euro Disney’s finances have been hit by the 2015 Paris attacks, which have led to fewer visitors to the French capital and by tough business conditions throughout France and Europe in 2016, Disney said in a statement. The French offshoot of the U.S. media and theme park empire has been struggling under increasing losses, recording a 2016 net loss of 858 million euros, from 102 million euros in 2015. Walt Disney reiterated it would support a recapitalization of up to 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion), which would help to cut Euro Disney’s debt and improve its financial position. Euro Disney was Europe’s largest-ever initial public offering when it floated and analysts thought Euro Disney stock promised “good long-term returns”, but it never delivered on that promise, leaving many shareholders with losses. Walt Disney has since increased its holding in its European offspring and earlier on Friday the U.S. company said it had swapped a 9 percent stake with Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, the investment firm owned by Alwaleed. Kingdom and Alwaleed are major investors in U.S. companies in technology and other sectors, and together own more than five percent of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N). Kingdom Holding said it was making a net profit of $61 million from the deal, which involved trading 90 percent of its shares in Euro Disney into Walt Disney Co stock. “We continue to have confidence in Disney and remain committed to investing in France,” Alwaleed said in a statement.

1256,DIS,Disney plans midnight 'Star Wars' event to unveil 'Last Jedi' toys,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co and major retailers will release the galaxy’s newest “Star Wars” toys at a Sept. 1 midnight event ahead of the holiday debut of the next film in the saga, “The Last Jedi,” company executives told Reuters. The marketing push called “Force Friday II” is a sequel to an event Disney used to build buzz for merchandise tied to the 2015 movie “The Force Awakens.”  Star Wars products were a big contributor to the financial success of the series reboot. BB-8 droids, lightsabers and other playthings made “Star Wars” the U.S. toy industry’s top-selling property for 2015 and 2016, with $1.5 billion in sales over the two years, research firm NPD said. Hasbro Inc cited “Star Wars” sales when it reported its biggest quarterly revenue rise in nearly five years for the December 2015 quarter. Mattel Inc also posted a surprise rise in sales for the same period with help from “Star Wars”-based Hot Wheels toys. And at Disney, licensing income from “Force Awakens” merchandise drove record quarterly operating income in the consumer products unit. Force Friday II will begin just after midnight on Sept 1. Lego, Hasbro and others will release the first toys, apparel, books and other products tied to “The Last Jedi,” both online and in stores around the globe at retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp , Toys R Us Inc (IPO-TOYS.N), Kohls Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Disney Stores.  Disney will incorporate new technology to its “Last Jedi” products like it did with the popular BB-8 droid, said James Pitaro, chairman of Disney consumer products and interactive media. New products will feature returning characters such as Rey and Finn, plus new ones, and will span a broad range of categories for male and female fans, he said. “One of our top priorities is to expand the audience,” Pitaro said. Disney bought “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm in 2012.      “The Last Jedi,” the eighth installment in the “Star Wars” saga that began in 1977, debuts in theaters Dec. 15. Toys typically hit shelves closer to a movie’s release, around four to six weeks in advance.  At the 2015 Force Friday, fans dressed as stormtroopers and Jedi waited hours in line ahead of the midnight store openings. “There was a certain mania that took over,” said Marty Brochstein, a senior vice president at the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers’ Association.

1257,DIS,UPDATE 1-Disney plans midnight 'Star Wars' event to unveil 'Last Jedi' toys,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co and major retailers will release the galaxy’s newest “Star Wars” toys at a Sept. 1 midnight event ahead of the holiday debut of the next film in the saga, “The Last Jedi,” company executives told Reuters. The marketing push called “Force Friday II” is a sequel to an event Disney used to build buzz for merchandise tied to the 2015 movie “The Force Awakens.”  Star Wars products were a big contributor to the financial success of the series reboot. BB-8 droids, lightsabers and other playthings made “Star Wars” the U.S. toy industry’s top-selling property for 2015 and 2016, with $1.5 billion in sales over the two years, research firm NPD said. Hasbro Inc cited “Star Wars” sales when it reported its biggest quarterly revenue rise in nearly five years for the December 2015 quarter. Mattel Inc also posted a surprise rise in sales for the same period with help from “Star Wars”-based Hot Wheels toys. And at Disney, licensing income from “Force Awakens” merchandise drove record quarterly operating income in the consumer products unit. Force Friday II will begin just after midnight on Sept 1. Lego, Hasbro and others will release the first toys, apparel, books and other products tied to “The Last Jedi,” both online and in stores around the globe at retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp , Toys R Us Inc (IPO-TOYS.N), Kohls Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Disney Stores.  Disney will incorporate new technology to its “Last Jedi” products like it did with the popular BB-8 droid, said James Pitaro, chairman of Disney consumer products and interactive media. New products will feature returning characters such as Rey and Finn, plus new ones, and will span a broad range of categories for male and female fans, he said. “One of our top priorities is to expand the audience,” Pitaro said. Disney bought “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm in 2012.      “The Last Jedi,” the eighth installment in the “Star Wars” saga that began in 1977, debuts in theaters Dec. 15. Toys typically hit shelves closer to a movie’s release, around four to six weeks in advance.  At the 2015 Force Friday, fans dressed as stormtroopers and Jedi waited hours in line ahead of the midnight store openings. “There was a certain mania that took over,” said Marty Brochstein, a senior vice president at the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers’ Association.

1259,DIS,UPDATE 3-Oscars draw lowest U.S. audience since 2008 with 32.9 mln viewers,"(Reuters) - ABC’s Sunday night broadcast of the Academy Awards hosted by comic Jimmy Kimmel drew the smallest audience since 2008 despite a memorable ending that will go down in history.  Some 32.9 million U.S. viewers watched the ceremony, a 4 percent drop from the 2016 Oscars which drew 34.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen data released on Monday by ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). The 2008 Oscars averaged 32 million viewers. The awards ceremony went a few minutes past midnight on the East Coast and ended in controversy when “La La Land” was mistakenly named best picture winner after presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were given the wrong envelope. The actual winner, announced minutes later, was “Moonlight.” [L1N1GA0LX] The chaotic and heart-stopping finale made for great television, but came too late to help ratings.  Viewership may have declined because “La La Land” had been a heavy favorite to sweep the awards, leaving little suspense for the TV audience, said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. “There was a foregone conclusion that ‘La La Land’ was going to sweep, and there’s not much intrigue to knowing the outcome,” Bock said. “Obviously, that was one of the most exciting endings in Hollywood history.” He also noted that only two of the year’s 20 top-grossing films were nominated for best picture. The biggest movies of 2016, such as “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” and Marvel’s “Doctor Strange,” were left out of the top category. “Moonlight” has a $22.3 million domestic box office haul, making it the smallest-grossing best picture winner since “The Hurt Locker” won in 2010, and the second-lowest since at least 1978, according to Box Office Mojo. The decline in viewership for the Oscars breaks the streak of higher ratings for award shows in 2017 after both the  Grammys and Golden Globes showed gains over last year.  Despite the slide in viewership, the Oscars are still expected to be the most-watched non-sporting event on U.S. television this year. ABC has the broadcast rights for the Oscars until 2028.  The show and Kimmel received generally positive reviews from TV critics. “Sunday night’s Academy Awards felt like they were a joyful, messy tribute to how revelatory and wonderful cinema can be, at its best and most ambitious,” wrote Variety TV critic Sonia Saraiya.  Kimmel “was a consistently amusing, good-natured presence who usually hit the mark, and who was able to recover quickly when he didn’t,” wrote Robert Bianco of USA Today. But the best picture blunder was the most talked-about moment of the show. “Once again, at the Academy Awards, a long night produced a shocking upset and unforgettable television,” wrote James Poniewozik of the New York Times. The mix-up “made it truly worth sitting to the end of a long, long awards show,” he said.

1260,DIS,Disney's 'Zootopia' wins Oscar for best animated film,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Animal cartoon “Zootopia,” an exploration of bias through the comedic story of a bunny who becomes a police officer, won the Academy Award on Sunday for best animated feature film. The movie from Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) Disney Animation Studios was one of year’s biggest box-office hits, selling more than $1 billion in tickets worldwide. “Zootopia” features the voice of Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, a rabbit who leaves her small hometown to join the big-city police force. The family film tackles social issues as the residents of the animal metropolis are divided by prejudice and fear. Jason Bateman voices the role of a conniving fox. The social commentary of “Zootopia” arrived in theaters as the United States grappled with issues of racism, sexism and inequality during the 2016 presidential campaign. The filmmakers started developing “Zootopia” about five years ago with “this crazy idea of talking about humanity with talking animals, in hopes when the film came out it would make the world just a slightly better place,” co-director Byron Howard said as he accepted the award. Co-director Rich Moore said he was grateful to audiences around the world “that embraced this story of tolerance being more powerful than fear of the other.”  The Oscar win for “Zootopia” extends a renaissance for Disney Animation Studios, which took home the animation trophy in 2014 for “Frozen” and in 2015 for “Big Hero Six.” “Zootopia” was co-directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore. “Zootopia” competed against another Disney Animation film, the musical “Moana” about a young Pacific island heroine. Other nominees were stop-motion film “Kubo and the Two Strings,” Swiss drama “My Life as a Zucchini,” and “The Red Turtle,” a film with no dialogue, from Japan’s Studio Ghibli.

1261,DIS,Fitch Rates Disney's Senior Unsecured Note Offering 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt  Disney Company's (Disney) proposed offering of benchmark-sized three- and five-  year fixed- and floating-rate senior unsecured notes. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. The proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for general  corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding debt.  Fitch currently rates Disney's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'. Approximately  $20.7 billion of debt was outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2016, including $2.3  billion of commercial paper (CP). A full list of ratings follows at the end of  this release. Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain consistent and  within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated leverage of  1.2x as of the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended Dec. 31, 2016, is in line with fiscal year-end 2016 and 2015  metrics. Going forward, Fitch believes leverage will range between 1x and 1.3x  during the ratings horizon after consideration for a modest increase in debt  levels related to the higher level of share repurchases. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Financial Flexibility: Disney's operating profile positions the  company to generate free cash flow (FCF) in excess of $3.5 billion annually  during the ratings horizon, which coupled with strong liquidity and solid credit  metrics provides the company with considerable financial flexibility at the  current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resorts segment  is expected to increase capital spending in excess of $5 billion during fiscal  2017, which will temporarily hamper FCF generation. Consistent Financial Policy: Given the strength of Disney's underlying  businesses, strong liquidity position and Fitch's FCF expectations, Disney has  the financial flexibility to accommodate a higher level of share repurchases,  which are expected to range between $7billion and $8 billion during fiscal 2017,  consistent with its current ratings. Ratings incorporate Fitch's expectations  that the company's share repurchases and M&A; activity will likely exceed FCF  generation given strong liquidity and the current credit profile. Leading Market Positions and Leveragability: Disney has a very consistent  investment strategy centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and  content that is leverageable across Disney's various platforms. Disney is  uniquely positioned, relative to its peers, to capitalize and monetize its  internally or externally developed franchises and brands, which in turn  strengthens the company's operating and credit profile and provides Disney with  a sustainable competitive advantage. Strength of Cable Networks: Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks,  particularly ESPN, underlies the company's ratings. Fitch believes that the  top-tier channels will continue to be a 'must carry' for the distributors and  are likely to retain pricing power. Disney's operating profile benefits from the  stability, recurring dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF  generation characteristics attributable to its cable network business. Fitch  expects this segment will continue to generate a significant amount of Disney's  cash flow. Credible Strategy to Address Threats: Disney's strong asset portfolio positions  the company to address the secular threats and opportunities presented by  emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience fragmentation  across the media and entertainment landscape.  Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial policy  over the ratings horizon. In our view Disney maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of its business. In terms of  capital allocation priority, investing in internal opportunities focused on  organic growth, such as the company's investment in its various parks and  resorts worldwide and long-term sports rights deals, rightly takes precedence  over merger and acquisitions and shareholder returns. Fitch expects that Disney will manage the level of share repurchase activity in  a manner consistent with its current ratings and acknowledges that the company's  share repurchases and M&A; activity will likely exceed FCF generation. Fitch  anticipates share repurchases to range between $7 billion and $8 billion during  fiscal 2017. Disney repurchased approximately 15 million shares of its common  stock for approximately $1.5 billion during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As  of Dec. 31, 2016, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase  approximately 267 million additional shares. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --Revenue growth within the company's cable networks business (Disney's Media  Networks segment) reflects the stability of the business and expected affiliate  fee increases. Fitch anticipates mid-single-digit affiliate revenue growth.  --Disney's broadcasting business benefits from a stable economic and advertising  environment while incorporating typical political advertising revenue cycle.  Additionally, this segment will benefit from growing retransmission consent  fees. Revenue growth ranges between 2% during non-political years and 4% during  political years. --Programming expenses are expected to increase by high-single digits driven by  sports rights costs.  --Fitch assumes typical volatility within the Studio Entertainment, Parks and  Resort, and Consumer Products & Interactive Media operating segments.  --International revenues grow faster than domestic revenues within the company's  Parks and Resort segment in fiscal 2017. Fitch expects mid-single-digit growth  in domestic park revenues as a result of the opening of Pandora - The World of  Avatar. --Fitch expects flat- to low-double-digit growth within Disney's Studio  Entertainment segment this year due to a fewer number of theatrical releases in  fiscal 2017. Home entertainment revenues will track the theatrical success in  2016-2018. Television and SVOD revenues grow at a mid-single-digit pace while  home entertainment revenues remain flat. --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes relatively flat margins  within the company's Media Networks segment as retransmission revenue gains  enhance broadcast margins while cable network margins remain stable reflecting  the company's ability to grow higher margin affiliate fee revenues at a similar  pace as increasing programming costs.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.  However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more  conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary  actions of Disney's management rather than operating performance, reflecting the  company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase leverage  beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will likely  lead to a negative rating action. LIQUIDITY Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and are  supported by significant FCF generation as well as $6 billion of aggregate  available borrowing capacity (as of Dec. 31, 2016) under three credit  facilities. Commitments under these credit facilities support the company's $6  billion CP program and expire during March 2017 ($1.5 billion), March 2019  ($2.25 billion) and March 2021 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had  approximately $3.7 billion of cash on hand as of Dec. 31, 2016. Scheduled  maturities are well laddered and manageable considering FCF generation  expectations and access to capital markets.  Disney has approximately $1.1 billion of debt scheduled to mature during the  remainder of its fiscal 2017 followed by $1.8 billion during fiscal 2018. Fitch  does not expect debt reduction going forward. Total debt as of Dec. 31, 2016 was approximately $20.5 billion and consisted of: --$2.3 billion of CP; --$168 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from May 2017 to  2093; --$1.1 billion of debt related to international theme bark borrowings, which is  non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption  that the company would back the loan payments;  --Approximately $329 million of foreign currency-denominated debt. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of  any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats  the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the  absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney  Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, we do  not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'  category investment-grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial  policies, and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney  Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if we viewed  there to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade  (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant). FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently has the following ratings: The Walt Disney Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'; --Senior unsecured revolvers 'A'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

1265,DIS,Disney CEO says staying on Trump advisory council,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief Executive Bob Iger on Wednesday defended his seat on President Trump’s business advisory council as an opportunity to voice opinions that will benefit the company and its shareholders. Facing questions regarding his inclusion on the council at the Disney’s annual shareholders meeting, the chief executive said he had no plans to step down from the group, as some critics have urged him to do. In response to one question, Iger said he did not believe his membership “supports or endorses” Trump’s policies. Another speaker, who identified himself as a member of the Colorado People’s Alliance, said Iger’s decision to remain on the council suggests Disney “is tacitly endorsing Trump’s agenda.”  Iger, however, referenced a song from the Broadway musical “Hamilton” called “The Room Where It Happens,” saying it was important to have input in a forum where policies are being shaped. “I think there is an opportunity, when you are in the room where it happens, to express opinions I believe would be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,” he said at meeting held in Denver. Iger said he would at times express views “likely to be adversarial” to the president.  Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit Trump’s advisory group in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration’s immigration policies. Iger said immigration had helped Disney in many ways, citing the issue as an example of something he could address on the Trump advisory council.  The United States and Disney have “benefited from an open and fair immigration policy,” Iger said. “I don’t happen to believe policies that single people out by religion are fair and just.” Iger skipped the first meeting of Trump’s advisory council in February to attend a previously scheduled board meeting. He fielded several questions on political topics at the meeting with another speaker suggesting that Disney-owned ABC News holds a liberal political bias, a charge Iger vigorously rejected. “They work very, very hard to present news in a fair way,” Iger said, adding that he did not agree the media was “an enemy of the people,” as Trump has written on Twitter. Iger said there were times the Obama administration disliked coverage by ABC News. “I am proud of the fact news can be an adversary,” Iger said.

It said it has the support of more than 5 percent of Euro Disney shareholders, including its holding. “The Walt Disney Company seeks to force out the remaining minority shareholders by offering them a new public offer, under penalty of having to undergo a strong dilution later,” said the letter, dated March 6. CIAM has not declined Walt Disney’s offer but is monitoring the situation, a source familiar with the matter said. Euro Disney defended the terms of the Walt Disney takeover. “Given the financial challenges faced by Euro Disney, The Walt Disney Company has developed a long-term solution that takes into account all stakeholders,” it said in a statement. “We believe such an operation will provide Euro Disney with a strong financial footing to continue its strategy, while providing minority shareholders the opportunity to exit at a significant premium,” it added. Walt Disney last month announced plans to take full control of Euro Disney, after raising its stake to 85.7 percent through a deal with Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Walt Disney has said it would also support a recapitalisation of up to 1.5 billion euros, helping cut debt and improve Euro Disney’s financial position. Minority shareholders will be offered 2 euros ($2.13) a share to sell their stake to Walt Disney - a 67 percent premium to Euro Disney’s share price on Feb 9, which was the day before the offer was announced. Walt Disney will buy out and delist the remaining shares from the Euronext Paris stock exchange if it gets to a stake of at least 95 percent. The shares stood at 1.99 euros on Tuesday. Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 and has struggled financially for much of that time, after making overly optimistic visitor projections and taking on too much debt. Deadly attacks in Paris in 2015 by Islamist militants also hit the broader French tourism sector, and Euro Disney racked up a net loss of 858 million euros in 2016.

1272,DIS,UPDATE 1-Activist hedge fund opposes Walt Disney's move on Disneyland Paris,"(Adds Euro Disney response, background) * Euro Disney defends terms of Walt Disney takeover * Disneyland Paris has struggled with losses and debts LONDON/PARIS, March 14 (Reuters) - An activist hedge fund has clubbed together with other minority shareholders to object to plans by Walt Disney to take full control of the debt-laden Paris theme park operator, Euro Disney, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Paris-based CIAM, which owns 1.4 percent of Euro Disney shares, has written to the board of the French company to object to what it believes are plans by Walt Disney to force out minority shareholders. It said it has the support of more than 5 percent of Euro Disney shareholders, together with its holding. “The Walt Disney Company seeks to force out the remaining minority shareholders by offering them a new public offer, under penalty of having to undergo a strong dilution later,” said the letter, dated March 6. Euro Disney defended the terms of the Walt Disney takeover. “Given the financial challenges faced by Euro Disney, The Walt Disney Company has developed a long-term solution that takes into account all stakeholders,” it said in a statement. “We believe such an operation will provide Euro Disney with a strong financial footing to continue its strategy, while providing minority shareholders the opportunity to exit at a significant premium,” it added. Last month, Walt Disney announced plans to take full control of Euro Disney, after raising its stake in the underperforming operator of Disneyland Paris through a deal with Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Minority shareholders will be offered 2 euros ($2.13) a share to sell their stake to Walt Disney - a 67 percent premium to Euro Disney’s share price on Feb 9, which was the day before the offer was announced. Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 and has struggled financially for much of that time, after making overly optimistic visitor projections and taking on too much debt. Minority shareholders have long complained about the way the company was run and Disney could face resistance to the offer despite the premium. Deadly attacks in Paris in 2015 by Islamist militants also hit the broader French tourism sector, and Euro Disney racked up a net loss of 858 million euros in 2016. As part of its takeover, Walt Disney will also support a recapitalisation of Euro Disney of up to 1.5 billion euros, helping cut debt and improve Euro Disney’s financial position.

1278,DIS,Disney board extends CEO Iger's contract by one year,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s board (DIS.N) extended the term of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger by one year as it continues searching for a successor to a long-serving leader who is popular on Wall Street, the company said on Thursday. The extension, until July 2, 2019, is a third for the 66-year-old Iger, who said last month he was open to extending his term. Originally, Iger had said he would retire in April 2015, but he then agreed to stay through June 2016 and then later to remain until June 2018.  Disney shares closed 0.1 percent higher at $112.24 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company and owner of sports network ESPN, a movie studio and theme parks around the world, is still searching for a capable hand to step into Iger’s shoes. Speaking on Thursday at a technology and entertainment conference, Iger said he and the board agreed “we could use more time to not only spend on succession but to create a better transition.”  “I feel great about it, but I’m serious this time around ... I promise,” he said in an interview conducted by his wife, journalist Willow Bay. She is the incoming dean of the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, which co-hosted the event with USC’s Marshall School of Business. Iger will remain a consultant to Disney for three years after his chairman and CEO term ends. Orin Smith, independent lead director of Disney’s board, said the company and shareholders “will be best served by (Iger’s) continued leadership as the board conducts the robust process of identifying a successor and ensuring a smooth transition.”  Cowen and Company analyst Doug Creutz, who rates Disney “market perform,” said the news was “largely neutral” for the stock given the relatively short extension and because no successor was named. Iger, who became Disney’s CEO in 2005, orchestrated successful acquisitions of Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm. He also oversaw the building of Shanghai Disney Resort in China and expansions at Disney’s U.S. theme parks. Investors have seen a total shareholder return during Iger’s tenure of 448 percent, compared with 144 percent for the S&P; 500 during that time, Smith said.  However, Disney has recently faced questions about the future of ESPN, which has lost subscribers as younger viewers move away from traditional pay television packages. Disney’s former chief operating officer Tom Staggs had been seen as the likely replacement for Iger, but he unexpectedly left the company in 2016. In a regulatory filing, Disney said Iger's annual compensation for the extended employment period remained unchanged. He will receive a $5 million bonus for staying an extra year. bit.ly/2mwc3Jn ",3232017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-ceo/disney-board-extends-ceo-igers-contract-by-one-year-idUSKBN16U23I

1283,DIS,Fitch Affirms Disney's IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) assigned to The Walt Disney Company (Disney) and its subsidiaries at 'A'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Approximately $21.5 billion of pro forma debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2016 is affected by this action. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Financial Flexibility: Disney's operating profile positions the company to generate free cash flow (FCF) in excess of $3.5 billion annually during the ratings horizon, which, coupled with strong liquidity and solid credit metrics provides the company with considerable financial flexibility at the current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resorts segment is expected to increase capital spending to approximately $5.3 billion during fiscal 2017 due to the construction of Star Wars Land and Pandora Avatar Land, which will temporarily hamper FCF generation. Consistent Financial Policy: Given the strength of Disney's underlying businesses, strong liquidity position, and Fitch's FCF expectations, Disney has the financial flexibility to accommodate a higher level of share repurchases, which are expected to range between $7 billion and $8 billion during fiscal 2017, in a manner consistent with its current ratings. Ratings incorporate Fitch's expectations that the company's share repurchases and M&A; activity will likely exceed FCF generation given strong liquidity and the current credit profile. Leading Market Positions and Leveragability: Disney has a very consistent investment strategy centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and content that is leverageable across Disney's various platforms. Disney is uniquely positioned, relative to its peers, to capitalize and monetize its internally or externally developed franchises and brands, which in turn strengthens its operating and credit profile and provides Disney with a sustainable competitive advantage. Strength of Cable Networks: Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks, ESPN in particular, underpin the company's ratings. Fitch believes that the top-tier channels will continue to be a must-carry for the distributors and are likely to retain pricing power. Disney's operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation characteristics attributable to its cable network business. We expect this segment will continue to generate a significant amount of Disney's cash flow. Credible Strategy to Address Threats: Disney's strong asset portfolio positions the company to address the secular threats and opportunities presented by alternative distribution platforms such as OTT services and digital multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs), and continued audience fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. Though the broadcasting and media industry continue to feel the pressure of subscriber losses, Fitch believes Disney has the appropriate levers in place and investment strategy to address changing consumer habits. Overall the ratings reflect the company's leading market positions within its core businesses. Further, Disney has a very consistent investment strategy that is centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and content that is leverageable across its various platforms (cable and broadcast network, studio, parks and resorts, and consumer products). Disney's operating profile positions it to generate meaningful levels of FCF (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends), providing the company with considerable financial flexibility at the current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resort segment is expected to increase capital spending to approximately $5.3 billion during fiscal 2017, which will temporarily hamper FCF generation during fiscal 2017. Fitch anticipates that Disney will generate in excess of $3.5 billion of annual FCF during the ratings horizon. Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks underlies the company's ratings, and its operating profile continues to benefit from the stable, recurring dual-stream revenue profile and high operating margin characteristics attributable to its cable network business. Fitch believes there is sufficient flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate slower affiliate fee revenue and operating income growth within this business. Disney's cable networks generate the largest portion of total revenue and EBITDA, resulting in incremental stability in the total revenue and FCF profile. Secular issues such as the stagnant multi-channel video subscriber base and its effect on affiliate fee revenue, rising programming costs - particularly sports programming, the impact of foreign exchange, and Disney's ability to pass the higher costs on to MVPDs will remain a significant risk to its operating profile. However, Fitch believes that Disney is in a strong position to retain pricing power going forward, as its collection of top-tier cable networks continue to command audience and ratings and be a must-carry for the MVPDs. In addition, Disney has, in large part, successfully matched the tenor of its long-term sports programming rights with the terms of its various affiliation agreements with the MVPDs. Ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the company's businesses, particularly Parks & Resorts (31% of Disney's revenue through the latest 12 months (LTM) Dec. 31, 2016), Consumer Products & Interactive Media, and the advertising portion of broadcast and cable networks (15% of total revenues). Should macroeconomic volatility return, we expect these cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure but that the company's credit and financial profile will likely remain within expectations for the current ratings. Disney is well positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. The evolving media landscape, including the growing prominence of streaming services and digital content, will not have a material negative impact on Disney's credit profile or FCF over the intermediate term. Further, in Fitch's view, the proliferation of new over-the-top entrants and methods of consumption will continue to drive more demand for Disney's content. As to uncertainty around the continued ability of cable networks to pass increased programming costs on to distributors, Fitch believes it poses moderate risk to cable network providers over the longer term. Mitigants for Disney include Fitch's belief that the top-tier channels will retain leverage with distributors going forward. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's expectations are based on the agency's internally produced, conservative rating case forecasts. They do not represent the forecasts of rated issuers individually or in aggregate. Key Fitch forecast assumptions include: --Revenue growth within the company's cable networks business (Disney's Media Networks segment) reflects the stability of the business and modest affiliation-fee increases partially offset by subscriber losses. Long-term contracts and built-in price escalators support affiliation- fee growth. The base case assumes cable revenue growth in the mid-single digits for the balance of the forecast. --Disney's broadcasting business benefits from a stable economic and advertising environment while incorporating a typical political advertising revenue cycle. Additionally, this segment will benefit from growing retransmission consent fees. Revenue growth ranges between 2% during non-political years and 3%-4% during political years. --Domestic revenues grow faster than International revenues within the company's Parks and Resort segment in fiscal 2018 and 2019 when Avatar Land and Star Wars Land open. The base case assumes domestic revenues grow approximately 6% during the forecast period while international revenues grow 5% after a significant bump in 2016-2017 following the opening of Shanghai Disney Land. --Fitch expects a single-digit decline within Disney's Studio Entertainment segment in 2017 due to fewer releases and difficult prior year comps with respect to home entertainment (i.e. Star Wars). --Television and SVOD revenues grow at a mid-single-digit pace while home entertainment revenues remain flat-to-down single digits. Growth is expected to resume in 2018 based on a strong film slate and anticipated home releases tracking the success of the film slate. --Consumer products and Interactive Media segment revenue growth assumptions remain in the mid-single-digit range in 2017-2019; 2016 benefits from licensing of Star Wars. --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes margin contraction within the company's Media Networks segment as subscriber losses and increased sports programming costs offset affiliate growth. Fitch believes there is potential for margin expansion if OTT and digital MVPDs are successful and will more than offset subscriber losses. Disney's investments within its Parks and Resort segment lead to higher margins within its domestic business in 2019-2020. Studio Entertainment margins beyond 2017 remain relatively consistent with 2016, generating double-digit margins. A weaker film slate and fewer releases in 2017 are expected to pressure margins. --Scheduled debt maturities are refinanced upon maturity. LEVERAGE AND FINANCIAL POLICY Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial policy over the ratings horizon. We believe Disney maintains an appropriate balance between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of its business. In terms of capital allocation priority, Fitch believes investing in internal opportunities focused on organic growth, such as the company's investment in its various parks and resorts worldwide and long-term sports rights deals, takes precedence over merger and acquisitions and shareholder returns. Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain consistent and within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated pro forma leverage of 1.2x as of the LTM ended Dec. 31, 2016 is in line with fiscal year-end 2016 and 2015 metrics. Going forward, leverage should range between 1x-1.2x during the ratings horizon after consideration for a modest increase in debt levels related to the higher level of share repurchases. SHAREHOLDER RETURNS Fitch expects that Disney will manage the level of share repurchase activity in a manner consistent with its current ratings and acknowledges that the company's share repurchases and M&A; activity will likely exceed FCF generation. Share repurchases are anticipated to range between $7 billion and $8 billion during fiscal 2017. Disney repurchased approximately 15 million shares of its common stock for approximately $1.5 billion during its first quarter of fiscal 2017. As of Dec. 31, 2016, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 267 million additional shares. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term. However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration. Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary actions of Disney's management rather than by operating performance, reflecting the company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will likely lead to a negative rating action. LIQUIDITY Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and are supported by significant FCF generation as well as $7 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity (as of Dec. 31, 2016 pro forma for new 364-day credit facility) under three credit facilities. Commitments under these credit facilities support the company's $7 billion CP program and expire during March 2018 ($2.5 billion), March 2019 ($2.25 billion) and March 2021 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had approximately $3.7 billion of cash on hand as of Dec. 31, 2016. Scheduled maturities are well-laddered and manageable considering FCF generation expectations and access to capital markets. Disney has approximately $1.1 billion of debt that is scheduled to mature during the remainder of fiscal 2017 ($1 billion matured in Feb. 2017) followed by $1.8 billion and $2.8 billion during fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. Fitch does not expect debt reduction going forward. Total debt as of Dec. 31, 2016 pro forma for subsequent debt issuances and maturities was approximately $21.5 billion and consisted of: --$2.3 billion of commercial paper (CP); --$18 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from May 2017 - 2093; --$1.1 billion of debt related to international theme parks, which is non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption that the company would back the loan payments; --Approximately $329 million of foreign currency-denominated debt (as of Dec. 31, 2016), including the debt related to the acquisition of UTV. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch affirms Disney's ratings as follows: The Walt Disney Company --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Senior unsecured revolvers at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A' category-investment-grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial policies and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if it perceived heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

1286,DIS,"UPDATE 4-Comcast profit tops views on subscriber growth, movie hits","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) quarterly profit topped estimates on strong growth in cable and internet subscribers and hits such as “Fifty Shades Darker” and “Get Out” boosted movie revenue, the No. 1 U.S. cable operator said on Thursday.  Shares rose as much as 4 percent to a record high in early trading and were last at $39.91, up 3 percent from Wednesday’s close. Comcast’s cable television business is under pressure as younger viewers shun cable bundles in favor of cheaper streaming options such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O).  The company has been investing in customer service and is offering the X1 set-top platform for a variety of content. Last year, Comcast made Netflix available through X1 and announced a similar deal with Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube in February. Revenue in Comcast’s cable business rose 5.8 percent as the company added 42,000 video subscribers and 429,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, which industry analysts considered to be strong growth. The company also plans to offer a wireless service later this year in hope of increasing customer loyalty. The service, called Xfinity Mobile, will launch on Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ.N) airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the companies.  “We believe wireless represents the next massive opportunity for cable and this has yet to be embraced by investors,” wrote Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research.   Industry analysts have speculated that Comcast’s entry into the wireless market could mean it wants to buy a U.S. wireless carrier such as T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) or Verizon.  Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said in an interview with Bloomberg last week that he is open to deal talks with companies ranging from Comcast to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). “We are very content with the company we’ve got,” Comcast CEO Brian Roberts told CNBC on Thursday when asked about McAdam’s comments.  Sales in its NBCUniversal unit were up 14.7 percent, helped by a 43.2 percent increase in filmed entertainment revenue. Net income attributable to the company rose 20.2 percent to $2.57 billion, or 53 cents a share, in the first quarter.  Revenue jumped 8.9 percent to $20.46 billion. Analysts expected earnings of 44 cents per share on revenue of $20.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1287,DIS,Fitch Affirms Symetra Life's IFS at 'A' and Holdco's IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Symetra Life Insurance Company's (Symetra Life) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'A'. Fitch has also affirmed the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Symetra Financial Corporation (Symetra) at 'A-' and the ratings of all outstanding debt. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation follows the revision of the Rating Outlook for Symetra's parent, Sumitomo Life Insurance Company's (Sumitomo), to Stable from Negative as a result of the revision of the Japanese sovereign Outlook to Stable from Negative (see 'Fitch Revises Outlook on Japan to Stable; Affirms at 'A'', dated April 27, 2017 at www.fitchratings.com). Symetra's Outlook, which remains Stable, reflects that if the Japanese sovereign rating were to have been downgraded by one notch, Fitch likely would have affirmed its ratings, due to Symetra's lack of direct exposure to Japan and the issues that had constrained the country's sovereign rating. Based on Fitch's criteria, Symetra's strategic importance level is 'Very Important' within the Sumitomo enterprise, reflecting its position as its parent's U.S. platform. This, along with its standalone credit profile, which Fitch views as in line with an 'A' IFS rating, results in Symetra Life carrying the same IFS rating as Sumitomo. Sumitomo's IFS rating of 'A' remains constrained by the Japanese sovereign and is one notch below its unadjusted IFS rating of 'A+'. Symetra's ratings reflect its strong balance sheet, diversified earnings and moderate financial leverage. Additional strengths include the company's strong competitive position in the group medical stop-loss market and fixed annuities sold through banks. The standalone credit profile also considers Symetra's exposure to the protracted low interest rate environment. Fitch believes that with its liability mix, particularly its large legacy structured settlement and bank owned life insurance book, Symetra is more exposed to interest rate risk than peers. RATING SENSITIVITIES Symetra Life's IFS rating could be upgraded one notch above Sumitomo's IFS rating if its standalone credit profile improved to 'A+'. As a 'Very Important' subsidiary of Sumitomo, Symetra Life's IFS rating could also be upgraded in conjunction with an upgrade of the parent. In the event of a one notch downgrade of the parent's IFS rating to 'A-', Symetra Life could maintain its current 'A' IFS rating per Fitch's criteria. As a 'Very Important' subsidiary of Sumitomo, Symetra Life's IFS rating could be downgraded below the parent's IFS rating if its standalone assessment is downgraded by three or more notches. Symetra's holding company ratings are somewhat constrained by Sumitomo's ratings, which are capped by Japan's Long-Term Local-Currency IDR of 'A'. Therefore, a two notch upgrade of Sumitomo's IFS rating would be needed to upgrade Symetra's holding company ratings. Conversely, if Sumitomo's ratings were downgraded by more than one notch, based on its own credit quality, or deterioration in Japan's sovereign rating, Symetra's holding company ratings would also likely be lowered in conjunction with its parent. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Symetra Financial Corp. --IDR at 'A-'; --4.25% senior unsecured notes due July 15, 2024 at 'BBB+'; --8.3% junior subordinated CENts due Oct. 15, 2067 at 'BBB-'.

1288,DIS,"UPDATE 4-ESPN concerns drag on Disney, shares dip","(Reuters) - A decline in subscribers and higher programming costs at cash-cow ESPN weighed on shares of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Tuesday, overshadowing a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street estimates.  Investors have been closely watching how ESPN navigates the shakeup in television as viewers defect from traditional pay TV services and online services proliferate. Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts that Disney added customers on new digital platforms, but not enough to make up for subscriber losses from expanded basic cable packages.   Shares of the world’s biggest entertainment company dropped 2.4 percent in after-hours trading. Disney’s January through March profit beat analysts’ estimates as the company benefited from the success of live-action fairy tale adaptation “Beauty and the Beast” plus a new theme park in China. Total attendance to date at the Shanghai park will cross 10 million visitors in the coming days, faster than Disney projected, Iger said.  For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share hit $1.50, ahead of analysts’ projection of $1.41, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Overall revenue for the quarter rose 2.8 percent to $13.34 billion, but missed an analysts’ estimate of $13.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The cable division recorded a 3 percent drop in operating income to $1.79 billion.  ESPN lost subscribers during the quarter and was hit with higher programming costs, in part due to a new, more costly NBA contract, Disney said in its earnings report. Fewer subscribers means less revenue for ESPN, which is locked into sports programming contracts for several years. “Lower numbers of people paying for television is a big problem for ESPN, given the cost structure they have with sports rights over the next several years,” said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.  Iger said Disney was adapting quickly to the changing TV marketplace and was encouraged by consumer interest in digital services that feature ESPN, such as Dish Network Corp’s (DISH.O) Sling TV and Sony Corp’s (6758.T) PlayStation Vue. “The substantial growth we’re already seeing makes us bullish on the future of these nascent offerings,” Iger said. “Right now, they’re a small part of the pay TV universe, but we believe they’ll be a much bigger part of the business going forward.” Disney also is preparing to launch an ESPN subscription streaming service and bought a 33 percent stake in video-streaming company BAMTech for $1 billion last year.   Net income attributable to the company rose to $2.39 billion in the second quarter ended April 1, from $2.14 billion a year earlier.

Disney fell 2.5 percent and was the top drag on the Dow and the S&P; 500 after the media company reported quarterly revenue below analysts’ expectations. Trump said he fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading an investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign’s possible collusion with Russia, over his handling of an email scandal involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Analysts say the development could distract Trump from pursuing his promises, including the highly anticipated reform of the U.S. tax code. “I think the biggest issue is what this does to the Trump agenda on taxes,” Matthew Peterson, chief wealth strategist for LPL Financial wrote in a note. “The market really is expecting a cut. We still feel it’s a matter of when, not if a cut happens. But any thought this gets pushed to ‘18 is a market negative.” Demand for safe-haven assets like gold, bonds and the Japanese yen rose, while the dollar fell. Wall Street closed slightly lower on Tuesday after the S&P; hit a record intraday high for the second straight day and the VIX fell to a decade low. “The domestic political storm is a perfect excuse for the indices to take a badly needed rest,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial wrote. At 9:40 a.m. ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 52.07 points, or 0.25 percent, at 20,923.71, the S&P; 500 was down 2.54 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,394.38 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 5.90 points, or 0.1 percent, at 6,114.69. Six of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with consumer discretionary dropping 0.6 percent due to Disney and Priceline. Shares of Priceline tumbled 5 percent to $1,815 after the travel website operator issued a current quarter earnings estimate that missed analysts’ expectations. Nvidia surged nearly 14 percent after the chipmaker reported a better-than-expected jump in quarterly revenue. Shares of rival AMD also rose. Allergan was off 2 percent at $233.72 after the drugmaker recorded a quarterly loss. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,322 to 1,225.

1302,DIS,"UPDATE 1-As Shanghai's Magic Kingdom turns one, Disney pushes further into China","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Walt Disney celebrates the first anniversary of its $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai on Friday, a key plank of the entertainment giant’s push into the world’s second-largest economy through everything from English schools to films. China matters for Mickey Mouse’s owner: its box office takings there have tripled over the last two years and Shanghai Disneyland has seen more than 10 million guests in its first year, setting it on track for faster profits than Disney reaped from parks in Paris and Hong Kong, both loss-making for most of the years they have been open. The company was “extraordinarily encouraged” by the number of guests who visited Shanghai Disneyland and the satisfaction scores it received, Bob Chapek, head of parks and resorts, told reporters. “I think those are the sort of right precursors, if you will, for future development,” he said when asked about expansion plans. “We’re very encouraged by what we’ve seen.” Disney released 10 films in China last year, including “Zootopia” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” with ticket sales of about $1 billion, according to box office tracker EntGroup. That was up from four films and $313 million in 2014. Last month, it rolled out the red carpet in Shanghai for a rare world premiere of the latest film in its “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise. Stars Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Javier Bardem made an appearance.     It has also been tying up with partners like state-backed producer Shanghai Film Group, its digital subsidiary BesTV for online content, and Shanghai Shendi, its partner for Shanghai. Now, for the first anniversary of the Shanghai park, it will celebrate Disney-style, with lights, fireworks and visits by  executives including Chapek and Chief Executive Bob Iger. Chapek said their hotels at Shanghai Disneyland had hosted almost 750,000 people and had maintained occupancy levels significantly higher than the overall market.  Guests were also spending more time at the park than  anticipated, averaging about nine hours, he said. But along with the hotel rooms and rides, Disney is pursuing a steadier path to build brand and profit in downtown classrooms in six Chinese cities, where children study English with the help of Winnie the Pooh and Captain America. “With the theme park, films, co-productions, Disney English and retail, they’re creating an ecosystem to bring consumers in and foster a broader buzz and awareness,” said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group. “The aim is to recreate that feeling in the U.S. where you have multiple generations who know the characters and cartoons.” Disney said China was a strategically important market. “Not only is it home to Shanghai Disney Resort, our largest ever foreign investment, but it has a thriving studio, consumer products and media distribution business,” it said in a statement. Disney is hiring for schools in cities including Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Shanghai - all decorated with Disney characters and motifs. It has not all been plain sailing. Disney was forced to launch an investigation this year after an employee was found to have set up firms which made deals with local authorities using the Disney name. Local children are also more used to Asian cartoon heroes, while Disney faces caps on imported films, partial bans on foreign cartoons on TV and long-established domestic theme park rivals. However, for 7-year-old Sunny Sun who has been attending classes once a week at Disney English for the past two years, Disney characters are now familiar.  Her mother, freelance writer Happy Chen, plans to take her to the Shanghai park this summer, and says her daughter goes to almost every new Disney animation at the cinema. “Now she really yearns to go to the Disney park,” said Chen, pointing to the crossover between the classes, films, characters and the theme park.  “It’s all connected.” ",6162017,http://www.reuters.com/article/disney-china-anniversary/update-1-as-shanghais-magic-kingdom-turns-one-disney-pushes-further-into-china-idUSL3N1JD34U

1306,DIS,ABC TV settles with beef product maker in 'pink slime' defamation case,"(Reuters) - The U.S. ABC television network, owned by Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), has settled its closely watched defamation lawsuit with Beef Products Inc over news reports on a processed beef product that critics dubbed “pink slime,” both companies said on Wednesday. Terms of the settlement, which also covered the Beef Products Inc (BPI) claims against ABC reporter Jim Avila, were not disclosed. Privately-held BPI had claimed that the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Avila defamed the company by calling its processed beef product “pink slime” and making errors and omissions in a series of 2012 reports. BPI calls the product “lean finely textured beef.”  BPI attorney Dan Webb told Reuters the settlement came together “quickly this week,” but declined to provide details, citing a confidentiality agreement signed by both parties. The settlement came 3-1/2 weeks after the trial in the case got under way in Elk Point, South Dakota, around 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Sioux City, Iowa. BPI is based in nearby Dakota Dunes, South Dakota.  ABC said in a statement that it stood by its reporting. Avila said after the case was settled that the company was not retracting his stories or apologizing, and his 2012 “pink slime” reports remained on the ABC News website.     BPI’s signature product, commonly mixed into ground beef, is made from beef chunks, including trimmings, and exposed to bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill E. coli and other contaminants. A former microbiologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture is credited with having coined the term “pink slime.” “While this has not been an easy road to travel, it was necessary to begin rectifying the harm we suffered as a result of what we believed to be biased and baseless reporting in 2012,” BPI said in a statement.  “Through this process, we have again established what we all know to be true about Lean Finely Textured Beef: it is beef, and is safe, wholesome, and nutritious.”  ABC maintains its reports were correct and has said its reporting deserved protection under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and the press. “Throughout this case, we have maintained that our reports accurately presented the facts and views of knowledgeable people about this product,” ABC said in a statement, saying that it agreed to the settlement because “continued litigation of this case is not in the company’s interests.” Dane Butswinkas, an attorney for ABC and Avila, did not immediately respond to request for comment.  “We’re not retracting anything. We’re not apologizing for anything,” Avila told reporters outside of the Union County Courthouse where the trial was being held, in a report posted on the website of the local NBC affiliate.    The trial had been expected to last eight weeks. BPI had claimed up to $1.9 billion in damages, which could have been tripled to $5.7 billion under South Dakota’s Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act.  During its reports, ABC used the term “pink slime” more than 350 times across six different media platforms including TV and online, Webb said during opening statements on June 5.  In the aftermath of ABC’s broadcasts, BPI closed three of its four processing plants and said its revenue dropped 80 percent to $130 million. The company had around 1,300 employees before the reports. Some 700 were let go shortly after, Erik Connolly, a BPI attorney, told Reuters on Wednesday.  “If inaccurate information is being put out there by a news organization, particularly one with a powerful reach, it can cause tremendous damage,” he said. “There are real consequences to that for real people.”  Attorneys for ABC countered in opening arguments that the term was commonly used before ABC’s reports and said that BPI’s business was already suffering.   Sonja West, a professor of First Amendment law at the University of Georgia School of Law, said the case did not set a precedent because it ended in a settlement. However, it could have a chilling effect on coverage of sensitive stories.  “If that happens, it’s the public who suffers by missing out on valuable information about important matters. We don’t want a press that is always playing it overly safe with their reporting,” she said.

For CBS, the BBC deal replaces a previous arrangement it had with Sky, which is being acquired by 21st Century Fox, pending regulatory approval. For BBC News, CBS replaces a deal it had with Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) ABC. The partnership will enable both news organizations to strengthen coverage of complex international situations such as the crisis in Syria and Iraq, said David Rhodes, president of CBS News.  The deal also gives BBC more resources to cover the United States, particularly the Donald Trump presidency, in which there was a lot of international interest, he said. Jonathan Munro, head of newsgathering at BBC News, said his organization began working with CBS more closely during the U.S. Presidential campaign “as it became clear they could offer unrivalled logistical support to our teams in the field.” In an e-mailed statement, Munro said: “We will also benefit from their focus on original journalism, their significant radio and digital operations and their extensive affiliate network which covers every state in the Union.” There will be no layoffs at either organization as a result of the agreement, according to Rhodes and a representative at BBC News. The two organizations will begin sharing content immediately and additional newsgathering components will be added in the coming months, CBS News said.

1309,DIS,Fired Kermit the Frog puppeteer 'devastated' for failing his hero,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The man who voiced Kermit the Frog for 27 years wrote an emotional letter about being fired, saying he was “devastated to have failed in my duty to my hero.” Steve Whitmire made his comments in a blog post on Thursday, days after the Muppets Studio’s announcement of a new puppeteer to perform the role of the earnest Kermit, one of creator Jim Henson’s best-known characters. Kermit was performed by Henson since he created it in 1955 until his death in 1990. The character is best known for its tempestuous relationship with the ardent Miss Piggy. Whitmire, who started working on “The Muppet Show” in 1978 at age 19, took over the role from Henson. He called the Muppets “not just a job, a career or even a passion. They are an urgent, undeniable, impossible-to-resist way of life.” “I would never consider abandoning Kermit,” he added on his personal blog site, saying he was told in October 2016 that executives at Muppets Studio, owned by Walt Disney Co,  would be replacing the Kermit puppeteer. Without giving details, Whitmire said executives had raised two issues with him that he had tried to remedy in the past nine months without success. Disney executives declined to discuss the reasons for Whitmire’s departure but issued a statement saying “the Muppets Studio thanks Steve for his tremendous contributions to Kermit the Frog and The Muppets franchise. We wish him well in his future endeavors.” Whitmire performed the role of Kermit in numerous television shows, movies and live appearances, including “Sesame Street,” “Fraggle Rock,” “Muppets Most Wanted,” and in the recent fictional talk show TV reboot “The Muppets,” which ABC canceled in 2016 after one season. He also voiced the roles of Ernie, Rizzo the Rat, Beaker and Statler. Performer Matt Vogel will make his first outing as Kermit in a “Muppets Thought of the Week” video coming out next week.

Walt Disney World Resort in Florida will house the hotel where guests can live out a multi-day adventure within the intergalactic universe of the “Star Wars” film franchise, parks and resorts Chairman Bob Chapek told attendees gathered at Disney’s annual D23 fan convention in Southern California. Two new “Star Wars” themed lands coming to Disneyland in Anaheim, California and Orlando, Florida, will be called “Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge,” he said.

The lands will include a Millennium Falcon ride.  Disney plans to open a “Star Wars” land first in its California park and then in Florida in 2019.

Theme parks, Disney’s second-largest division, posted $1.9 billion in operating income for the six months ended April 1, according to its latest earnings report. Disney has been investing in new attractions at its U.S. theme parks as it faces competition from Comcast Corp’s Universal Studios.

1312,DIS,UPDATE 1-ABC News to target millennials with social video partnership,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) ABC News launched a partnership on Tuesday with ATTN:, a video news site focused on younger audiences, to co-produce videos for social media including Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) Instagram and for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).  The two will use ABC’s footage and equipment to produce short-length stories appealing to both companies’ audiences. ATTN: co-founder and Editor-in-Chief Matthew Segal will join ABC News as a contributor, the companies said on Tuesday. News networks are feeling pressure to find ways to reach younger audiences as millennials increasingly move to sites like YouTube and Hulu instead of broadcast TV. Only 8 percent of U.S. viewers of national broadcast television news in 2016 were in the 18-34-year-old age bracket, according to Nielsen.  Colby Smith, vice president of digital media at ABC Television Group, said the average age of viewers across ABC News’ digital platforms ranged from 30 to 40 years old, while Segal said the median age of ATTN:’s viewers was mid-to-late 20s. “One area where we’ve never homed in are big exclusives and interviews in our videos, and that’s where Matthew and his team are going to focus,” Smith said in an interview.  While ABC News regularly books big-name interviews for its programs including “Good Morning America” and “World News Tonight with David Muir,” ATTN: will bring its digital-first expertise to cut the footage for social media, ABC News said.  ABC News and ATTN: will have the right to monetize the videos that air on their social media platforms under the deal, Segal said. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. ATTN: participates in Facebook’s ad program that allows ATTN: to place ads in the middle of a video, and may use the strategy to monetize the videos made with ABC, Segal said.  Smith said ABC was considering participating in Facebook’s ad program, but declined to elaborate on plans to make money from the videos. The partnership comes after Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBC News launched a twice-per-day news show on Snapchat earlier this month to attract younger viewers. NBC News also introduced a digital video service called “NBC Left Field” to produce short documentaries and videos for YouTube, Facebook and Instagram with the intention of eventually running ads.  Privately held ATTN: was launched in 2014 and attracts 500 million monthly video views, according to its website. The site produces video and news pieces focused on a variety of political and social issues such as abortion and anti-Semitism.

1314,DIS,"Disney to pull movies from Netflix, plans own streaming service","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) will stop providing new movies to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) starting in 2019 and launch its own streaming service as the world’s biggest entertainment company tries to capture digital viewers who are dumping traditional television. Disney’s defection, announced on Tuesday alongside quarterly results showing continued pressure on sports network ESPN, is a calculated gamble that the company can generate more profit in the long run from its own subscription service rather than renting out its movies to services like Netflix.  In turn, Netflix and rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) HBO are spending billions of dollars to buy and produce their own content and stream it straight to consumers. Disney’s entry into a crowded subscription streaming market and the cost of technology to support its own online services could weigh on earnings, Wall Street analysts said.  Disney stock fell 3.8 percent in after-hours trade. Shares of Netflix fell 3 percent. The new Disney-branded streaming service will follow a similar offering from ESPN that will be available starting in 2018, the company said.  The streaming services will give Disney “much greater control over our own destiny in a rapidly changing market,” Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts on a conference call after earnings, describing the moves as an “entirely new growth strategy” for the company. Disney has some experience with the direct-to-consumer model in Britain and could make more money in the long run from its own service, but the move could be “financially less advantageous” in the near term, said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser. The new ESPN service will feature about 10,000 live games and events per year from Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, Major League Soccer and others, Disney said. It will not offer the marquee live sporting events shown on its cable channels.  Disney said its new services would be based on technology provided by video-streaming firm BAMTech, and announced it would pay $1.58 billion to buy an additional 42 percent stake in that company, which it took a minority stake in last year. The BAMTech deal will modestly dent earnings per share for two years, the company said. Disney is one of the most recognized names on Netflix, but it is not the company first to pull away. Starz Entertainment in 2011 pulled roughly 1,000 films in the Starz catalog on Netflix at the time. By ending the Netflix movie deal, Disney will keep movies such as “Toy Story 4” and “Frozen 2” for its own offering. The company has not yet decided where it will distribute films from superhero studio Marvel and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm after 2018, Iger said.  Netflix said it would continue to do business with Disney globally, including keeping its exclusive shows from Marvel television.  “U.S. Netflix members will have access to Disney films on the service through the end of 2019, including all new films that are shown theatrically through the end of 2018,” the company said in a statement.  The announcement came as Disney reported a near 9 percent fall in quarterly profit, pulled down by higher programming costs and declining subscribers at ESPN, as viewers ditch costly cable packages in favor of cheaper online offerings. The company’s revenue fell marginally to $14.24 billion in the third quarter ended July 1 from $14.28 billion a year earlier. Net income attributable to the company fell to $2.37 billion, or $1.51 per share, from $2.6 billion, or $1.59 per share.

Bargain-seeking investors instead turned their focus to strength in the global economy and earnings toward the end of an active trading day. “It’s amazing when you consider the headlines just how calm the equity markets are, how they’ve taken things in their stride,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. “There was some skittishness earlier but then some buyers stepped in,” he said. Investors had rushed to safe-haven assets after strongly worded exchanges between Washington and nuclear-armed North Korea late on Tuesday. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he did not believe there was an imminent threat. “You’d need to see something more tangible than just rhetoric for a broader pullback,” Richard Steinberg, managing director at HighTower Advisors in New York. After a dip of as much as 0.52 percent earlier in the day, Wall Street’s three major indexes bounced off intraday lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.64 points, or 0.17 percent, to end at 22,048.7, the S&P; 500 lost 0.9 point, or 0.04 percent, to 2,474.02 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.13 points, or 0.28 percent, to 6,352.33. While gold, a safe-haven favorite, pared some gains it was last up 1.2 percent at around its highest since mid-June, while the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen also rose. Politics lifted U.S. defense stocks. Lockheed Martin , Raytheon, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman all rose and the Dow Jones U.S. defense index was up 1.6 percent after hitting a record high. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, ended at a session low of 11.11 after rising as high as 12.63. Six of the S&P; 500 sectors ended higher. The consumer discretionary index was one of its biggest losers with a 0.47 percent drop. Its biggest drags were Priceline and Walt Disney. Disney shares closed down 3.9 percent as investors were skeptical of its plan to launch streaming services rather than rely on Netflix. Travel website operator Priceline Group Inc fell 6.9 percent after a disappointing financial forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.47-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

North Korea said it was considering plans to fire missiles at Guam, a U.S.-held Pacific island, after President Trump’s warning on Tuesday. Safe-haven assets gained following the mounting geopolitical tensions. Gold rose as much as 1.2 percent to a near two-month high, while the Swiss franc was on track to post its biggest single day rise in about two-and-a-half years. Trump’s comments also sparked a late afternoon selling on Tuesday, with the Dow ending a nine-day streak of closing records. The president followed his Tuesday warning with a tweet on Wednesday about the strength of the American nuclear arsenal, but expressed hope it would not need to be used. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, was up 1.17 points at 12.12 points, its highest level in a month. “Geopolitics splashed cold water on the markets,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “There’s uncertainty and caution as investors nervously eye the next foreign policy moves.” U.S. trading volume has been low with summer setting in and Congress expected to be in recess until Sept. 5. The S&P; hasn’t moved more than 0.5 percent in one day since July and has fallen more than 1 percent only twice this year. “Despite all this, there’s no reason to press the panic button. For now, the North Korea situation bears watching as there’s lots of tough talk, but we’ll see if it escalates,” said Kinahan. At 10:43 a.m. ET (1443 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 52.43 points, or 0.24 percent, at 22,032.91, the S&P; 500 was down 5.29 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,469.63. The Nasdaq Composite was down 30.74 points, or 0.48 percent, at 6,339.72. Nine of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the consumer discretionary index’s 10.2 percent fall leading the decliners. Shares of Dow component Walt Disney were down 4.44 percent as investors doubted whether it can succeed with its plan to launch its own streaming services rather than rely on Netflix Inc to reach online viewers. Netflix was down 2.35 percent. Travel website operator Priceline fell 7.92 percent, weighing the most on the S&P; and the Nasdaq, following a disappointing forecast. Travel-review website operator TripAdvisor was down 7.35 percent. Office Depot tumbled 23.57 percent after the office supplies retailer’s quarterly results came in below estimates. Rising geopolitical tensions boosted defense stocks. Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman were all up, lifting the Dow Jones U.S. defense index 1.17 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,899 to 859. On the Nasdaq, 1,881 issues fell and 795 advanced.

1325,DIS,Disney's streaming push seen paying off in the long run,"Aug 9 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s plan to plunge into a crowded streaming services market, dominated by pioneer Netflix Inc, could bring some initial pain, but the strength of the company’s content is expected to help it pull through in the long run. Shares of the world’s biggest entertainment company were down 6 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday, a day after Disney said it would stop providing new movies to Netflix starting in 2019. “With best in class copyrights and brands, and with IP rights to a plethora of sports content, it seems management has decided to play offense,” Evercore analysts wrote in a client note. The company’s entertainment empire stretches from Disney and Pixar animation studios, home to blockbusters such as “Frozen” and “Jungle Book”, to “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm and Marvel - the studio behind “Iron Man” and “Spider-Man”. It also includes theme parks, resorts and ESPN. The plan to go online marks an aggressive stance even as the company struggles with subscription losses as users defect to online streaming services such as Netflix and Time Warner Inc’s HBO. Disney said the new services would be based on technology provided by video-streaming firm BAMTech, in which the media company is increasing its stake to 75 percent by paying $1.58 billion. While most analysts said the move was encouraging, it is expected to affect results in the near term. “This may initially create angst with investors as DIS gives up a ‘bird in the hand’ from Netflix (easily $100+mm per year), invests in BAMTech, content and probably accelerates pay TV subscriber declines,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a client note. Disney’s 2019 slate of movies such as “Frozen 2” and “Toy Story 4” will not be available to Netflix subscribers, but other Disney-produced content such as the Marvel Defenders series will stay with Netflix. The new Disney-branded streaming service will follow a similar offering from ESPN that will be available starting in 2018. ESPN would be a mix of streaming and pay TV. This strategy likely attempts to balance ESPN’s strong pricing power as it enters a renewal cycle with distributors this quarter, while capitalizing on rising consumer demand and access to streaming content, Morgan Stanley analysts said. ESPN’s growth prospects were a cause for concern for investors as the unit had been steadily losing subscribers amid rising expenses for sports rights. “We view the ESPN announcement as probably Disney’s best chance of at least limiting, if not reversing, the margin pressure on its network business from subscriber and viewership attrition,” Cowen and Co analysts said. As video streaming is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, it was only a matter of time before Disney launched its own service, analysts said. “The future of the media business is clear and Disney’s strategic pivot will better position the company for the long-term,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.

Reuters could not immediately reach Disney and an attorney for BPI for comment.  In a statement in June, ABC said it stood by its reporting. After the case was settled, Avila said the company was not retracting his stories or apologizing, and his 2012 “pink slime” reports remained on the ABC News website.     BPI’s signature product, commonly mixed into ground beef, is made from beef chunks, including trimmings, and exposed to bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill E. coli bacteria and other contaminants. A microbiologist formerly with the U.S. Department of Agriculture is credited with having coined the term “pink slime.”     ",8092017,http://www.reuters.com/article/abc-pinkslime/disney-pays-at-least-177-million-to-settle-pink-slime-case-filing-idUSL1N1KV07P

1330,DIS,"Netflix discussing keeping Disney's Marvel, 'Star Wars' films","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc is in “active discussions” with Walt Disney Co about keeping Marvel and “Star Wars” films after 2019, when new Disney and Pixar movies will stop appearing on the streaming service, a senior executive said late on Thursday.  Disney announced on Tuesday that it was pulling new Disney and Pixar films from Netflix, starting with new releases in 2019. It will start putting the movies on a new Disney-branded online service that year. Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger told analysts the company had not yet decided where it would distribute superhero films from Marvel Studios and movies from “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm, which the company owns, at that time. Netflix is still in discussions with Disney about retaining rights to stream Marvel and Lucasfilm releases after 2019, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos told Reuters. Shares of Netflix were up 1.3 percent at $171.41 in afternoon trading after falling 5 percent in the two days following Disney’s announcement. A Disney spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Iger said on Tuesday that the Marvel and Lucasfilm movies could go to Netflix or another streaming service after 2019, or Disney might retain the rights for itself.  Sarandos said he expected Disney’s service to be “complementary” to Netflix, which carries other family-friendly programing such as animated movies from “Despicable Me” creator Illumination Entertainment and “Shrek” producer Dreamworks Animation. Disney’s plan to stream its content directly to consumers is “a natural evolution” for traditional media companies that Netflix expected, Sarandos said in an interview at an event to celebrate Emmy nominations for his company’s drama, “The Crown.” “That’s why we got into the originals business five years ago, anticipating it may be not as easy a conversation with studios and networks” to license their content, he added. Disney’s break from Netflix applies only to its film deal in the United States, where the streaming service runs new Disney movies shortly after they leave theaters.

Shares of Disney closed 4.4 percent lower at $97.06 on the New York Stock Exchange, and Comcast fell 6.2 percent to $38.60 on Nasdaq. Walt Disney and Comcast are the two latest examples of media and entertainment companies struggling under increased competition and a trend by consumers of ditching cable packages for less expensive online streaming options. Comcast expects to lose up to 150,000 video subscribers in the third quarter due to competition and the impact of recent hurricanes, Matthew Strauss, executive vice president of the company’s Xfinity Services, said at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference. The Xfinity unit comprises Comcast’s residential video, phone and internet businesses. Walt Disney’s chief executive, Bob Iger, said at the conference that the company’s earnings per share for the current fiscal year ending Oct. 1 will be roughly in line with a year ago, when it earned $5.72 per share. Analysts had been expecting the company to earn $5.88 this year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Disney’s new streaming service, set to launch in late 2019, will exclusively feature movies from the “Star Wars” franchise and Marvel films such as “Avengers” and “Iron Man,” Iger said. In addition, Disney will create four to five new Disney movies and four or five original TV shows exclusively for the streaming app, he said. Disney said last month it would launch its own streaming service and stop providing new movies to Netflix starting in 2019.

Apple fell 0.65 percent on a report that the new iPhone had faced production glitches that could result in supply shortfalls. Comcast’s 7 percent fall weighed the most on the S&P; and the Nasdaq, after the company said it expected to lose 100,000 to 150,000 video subscribers in the quarter due to competition. The Dow was pulled lower by a 3.36 percent fall in Walt Disney shares, after its chief executive warned earnings per share growth for this year would roughly be in line with what it reported last year. Disney’s fall weighed on other media stocks, with CBS down 3 percent and Twenty-First Century Fox off 3.9 percent. At 12:34 p.m. ET (1634 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 55.96 points, or 0.26 percent, at 21,751.68 and the S&P; 500 was down 4.66 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,460.88. The Nasdaq Composite was down 6.66 points, or 0.1 percent, at 6,386.66. Investors also kept a watch on Hurricane Irma as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century took aim at Florida. Irma comes close on the heels of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana more than a week ago, claiming 60 lives and causing property damage estimated as high as $180 billion. “As the hurricane moves, investors are looking for a better grip on the damage. There are far-reaching implications now that we have back-to-back ones,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director of Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Worries about the impact of hurricanes and weak U.S. jobless claims data sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yields to their lowest since Nov. 10. The fall in yields pressured financial stocks, with Goldman Sachs dipping 1.6 percent and Bank of America sliding 2.3 percent Initial claims for state unemployment benefits soared by 62,000 to 298,000 for the week ended Sept. 2, a Labor Department report showed. Economists had expected a rise to 241,000, according to a Reuters poll. General Electric fell 2.35 percent after a JPMorgan analyst downgraded the stock to “underweight”.

1346,DIS,UPDATE 1-TV viewership drops for NBC'S first NFL game,"(Reuters) - The NFL kickoff game broadcast on Thursday night on NBC, a win by the Kansas City Chiefs over the New England Patriots, attracted 21.8 million TV viewers, down more than 13 percent from last year’s opening game, data from NBC and Nielsen showed. Last year’s game between the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, also on Comcast Corp unit NBC, drew 25.2 million TV viewers.  Despite competition for attention, advertisers and television networks are optimistic for this season due to a more compelling game lineup and the NFL’s traditional broad reach. Viewership of the Thursday night game was probably reduced as fans in Texas, Florida and Georgia focused on recovering from Hurricane Harvey and bracing for Hurricane Irma, said Jason Kanefsky, director of strategic investments at marketing firm Havas Media Group, in an interview. Still, this season’s NFL primetime lineup of match-ups between highly ranked teams is improved from last year, said Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a note on Wednesday.  The schedule could stoke enough excitement among fans to bring up to 5 percent viewership growth for NBC’s Sunday Night Football, Nathanson said. Walt Disney Co’s ESPN, which holds the rights to Monday Night Football, could see 11 percent growth over last year.  Except for the Olympics, nothing compares to the NFL in the eyes of advertisers, who remain optimistic this season, Kanefsky said. “The ratings may be coming down, but it’s still an unbelievable media vehicle,” Kanefsky said of the NFL. Havas’ brand clients planning to buy ad time this season include those in retail, pharmaceuticals and banking, Kanefsky added.  NFL interest is still largely driven by Baby Boomers and Gen X viewers, large attractive audiences for brands, said Michelle Palmer, president The Marketing Arm, a sports marketing agency whose clients include insurance, communications and auto companies.  The 2016 presidential election campaign hurt ratings last season, analysts have said. Viewership rebounded after the November election, but was still down 5 percent from the previous season. Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Bank who covers Comcast, said advertising rates for games aired on NBC are expected to hold steady or even increase despite lower ratings, due to the network selling fewer ad spots and using digital to help their ad reach.

1354,DIS,"Walt Disney threatens to pull ESPN, ABC from Optimum","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has threatened to pull its programming from the fourth largest U.S. cable distributor, Altice USA, if the two parties cannot reach a deal before the end of the month, the cable company said on Sunday. New York-based Altice (ATUS.N), which is owned by a European conglomerate and is better known as Optimum, said Disney had asked it for “hundreds of millions of dollars” in new fees to be able to continue carrying ESPN and ABC, even as ratings suffer. The two parties have been working on a new contract to replace the one that expires at the end of the month, and Walt Disney has warned customers that its channels will go dark on Oct. 1 if a new deal is not worked out, according to media reports. “We are always working hard to negotiate carriage agreements that reflect the best interest of all our customers. We want to carry ESPN and its sister networks, including ABC and Disney, at a reasonable rate and have already offered an increase in retransmission fees and sports programming costs,” Altice said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Sunday. The majority of Altice’s customers live in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and parts of Pennsylvania. The company has said it had an obligation to warn customers about the loss of programming and disagreed with Altice’s characterization of the fee increase, according to media reports.  “Our contract with Altice is due to expire soon, so we have a responsibility to make our viewers aware of the potential loss of our programming,” a Disney spokeswoman said in a statement. “We remain fully committed to reaching a deal and are hopeful we can do so.” Disputes between cable companies and media groups over the cost of carrying channels are common, but the dispute marks the first time a cable company has pushed back at increased fees for ESPN, the most popular sports network.  The typical customer pays $160 or more each month for service to Altice, she said. Altice charges its customers $34, which is more than 15 times the amount Disney is seeking for the market’s most watched station, WABC, she added.     Altice said the request for “exorbitant fee increases” came even as viewership had been declining and that Disney now wanted to force customers who do not receive ESPN to pay for it anyway.

1355,DIS,"UPDATE 1-Walt Disney threatens to pull ESPN, ABC from Optimum","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has threatened to pull its programming from the fourth largest U.S. cable distributor, Altice USA, if the two parties cannot reach a deal before the end of the month, the cable company said on Sunday. New York-based Altice (ATUS.N), which is owned by a European conglomerate and is better known as Optimum, said Disney had asked it for “hundreds of millions of dollars” in new fees to be able to continue carrying ESPN and ABC, even as ratings suffer. The two parties have been working on a new contract to replace the one that expires at the end of the month, and Walt Disney has warned customers that its channels will go dark on Oct. 1 if a new deal is not worked out, according to media reports. “We are always working hard to negotiate carriage agreements that reflect the best interest of all our customers. We want to carry ESPN and its sister networks, including ABC and Disney, at a reasonable rate and have already offered an increase in retransmission fees and sports programming costs,” Altice said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Sunday. The majority of Altice’s customers live in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and parts of Pennsylvania. The company has said it had an obligation to warn customers about the loss of programming and disagreed with Altice’s characterization of the fee increase, according to media reports.  “Our contract with Altice is due to expire soon, so we have a responsibility to make our viewers aware of the potential loss of our programming,” a Disney spokeswoman said in a statement. “We remain fully committed to reaching a deal and are hopeful we can do so.” Disputes between cable companies and media groups over the cost of carrying channels are common, but the dispute marks the first time a cable company has pushed back at increased fees for ESPN, the most popular sports network.  The typical customer pays $160 or more each month for service to Altice, she said. Altice charges its customers $34, which is more than 15 times the amount Disney is seeking for the market’s most watched station, WABC, she added.     Altice said the request for “exorbitant fee increases” came even as viewership had been declining and that Disney now wanted to force customers who do not receive ESPN to pay for it anyway. High fees are to blame for rising cable bills, Altice said, adding that ESPN was already the most expensive basic cable channel in history.

1357,DIS,Disney tests new store design as shoppers go online,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is testing the first major redesign of its retail stores in seven years, adding interactive experiences and live streams of theme park parades to lure consumers tempted by online shopping. The world’s largest entertainment company also is launching a new shopping website on Tuesday, executives said in interviews. It is another response to the decline in visits to brick-and-mortar stores across the retail industry. Sales of toys, clothing and other merchandise are one way Disney generates revenue from its popular characters and inspires loyalty among fans. Disney’s physical stores are an important part of those sales.  “We knew we needed to elevate and improve the experiences that we have both in stores and online as retail is changing,” Paul Gainer, executive vice president of Disney retail, said in an interview at one of the two California locations testing the new approach.  Disney has grown and shrunk its network of retail stores over the years, and at one point sold off its U.S. and Canadian locations. It bought the stores back in 2008 and now operates 340 retail stores around the world. In the newly designed stores, kids can battle Darth Vader on a giant video screen, or interact with other characters from the Disney, Pixar, “Star Wars” and Marvel franchises. Store employees can tailor experiences for children celebrating a birthday, a good report card or another milestone. The same screen will show live feeds of parades at Disney theme parks. The revamped stores feature a smaller collection of products, with employees and signs directing shoppers to a much broader array for all ages on Disney’s website. The online selection at shopDisney.com includes new products for adults from luxury brands such as Coach Inc COH.N and Ethan Allen Interiors (ETH.N), and more of the exclusive items sold at Disney’s theme parks.  The stores and website have been designed to highlight Disney’s four major franchises. The idea is being tested at the two California stores as well as in Nagoya, Japan, and Shanghai. Locations in Munich and Miami will be redesigned later this year.  The retail spaces also have a new look that includes lower fixtures that make them feel more open.  Disney’s retail stores are part of its consumer products and interactive division, which generated $1.4 billion in operating income in the nine months through July 1, or 11 percent of the company’s total.

Disney and Altice have been sparring over how much the cable operator would pay to continue carrying ESPN, ABC and other channels on its Optimum cable service. Both sides are under pressure from cord cutting, or dropping of pay TV service, as audiences flock to cheaper streaming services.  “We have reached an agreement in principle and have extended the deadline accordingly to try and finalize the terms,” a joint statement from the companies said.  The last-minute deal came Sunday as Disney was preparing to pull its networks from Optimum. That could have deprived customers from seeing Tuesday’s baseball playoff game between the Minnesota Twins and New York Yankees as well as “Monday Night Football” and other programing. A blackout could have sent customers fleeing to other options. Disney secured fee increases for ESPN, local affiliate WABC and other major networks, according to sources familiar with the talks who requested anonymity because the negotiations were private.  The amount of the increases was not disclosed. Altice said in September it had offered to pay higher fees but called Disney’s proposal at the time “outrageous.” Altice USA is the fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, formed by Netherlands-based Altice NV (ATCA.AS) through its acquisitions of Cablevision — now known as Optimum — and Suddenlink Communications. Optimum has 3.1 million customers in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.

ESPN, Disney’s most important network, has been losing subscribers and seeing its ratings fall. That has cut revenue from cable operators, which pay monthly fees for each subscriber, and given Altice ammunition to push back against Disney’s demands as excessive.  Disney countered that Altice charges the average customer $160 or more per month and “the bulk of that money goes into their pocket.”  ESPN is the most expensive basic cable network, charging an average of $7.54 per subscriber each month, according to S&P; Global Market Intelligence’s Kagan research group.

1372,DIS,Walt Disney makes Maple bond debut with C$1.25 billion deal,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) sold C$1.25 billion of seven-year senior unsecured Maple notes on Tuesday, the company’s first issue in the Canadian-dollar denominated Maple bond market, which has seen a number of high profile deals in recent months. The private placement deal, which was upsized from C$750 million, was sold at a spread of 81 basis points over the Government of Canada curve. Guidance had been set at a spread of 84 basis points plus or minus 3 basis points. The bond carries a 2.758 percent coupon and matures on Oct. 7, 2024 but can be redeemed, at a cost, before maturity by the issuer. “Investors are clearly holding their hands up high saying we love the diversification that these issuers are showing to us,” said Brad Meiers, head of debt capital markets and syndication at HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc, which was one of the joint book-running managers.     AB InBev (ABI.BR), McDonald’s (MCD.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) have been among the blue-chip companies that have tapped this year the Maple bond market, in which foreign issuers sell Canadian dollar-denominated debt.     Apple issued a C$2.5 billion seven-year deal in August, which set a record amount for an issuer in the Maple bond market and tied as the biggest corporate issue in Canada. It was priced at a spread of 80 basis points over the curve. “For Canadian investors it makes a lot of sense because there has not been a lot of supply of non-financial CAD denominated investment grade debt issuance,” said Geoff Castle, a portfolio manager at PenderFund Capital Management. A Disney spokesman said the offering is part of its normal global funding efforts and proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Foreign issuers often act opportunistically, issuing in the Canadian dollar denominated debt market when they can swap the proceeds into U.S. dollars and achieve a cheaper overall borrowing cost, market players say. They could also be trying “to diversify their investor base across other currencies,” said Aubrey Basdeo, head of Canadian fixed income at BlackRock. “All issuers coming here do appear to have strong balance sheets, which makes it easier for investors to absorb these new issues,” Basdeo added.

1374,DIS,Fitch Rates Disney's Senior Unsecured Note Offering 'A' ; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt Disney Company's (Disney) offering of benchmarked-sized senior unsecured notes due 2024. The notes are being offered in Canada by private placement. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding debt. Fitch currently rates Disney's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'. The notes will rank pari passu with Disney's other unsecured indebtedness. Approximately $22.2 billion of debt was outstanding as of July 1, 2017, including $1.4 billion of commercial paper. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Financial Flexibility: Disney's operating profile positions the company to generate free cash flow (FCF) in excess of $3.5 billion annually during the ratings horizon, which, coupled with strong liquidity and solid credit metrics provides the company with considerable financial flexibility at the current ratings. Consistent Financial Policy: Given the strength of Disney's underlying businesses, strong liquidity position, and Fitch's FCF expectations, Disney has the financial flexibility to accommodate a higher level of share repurchases, which are expected to range between $9 billion and $10 billion during fiscal 2017, in a manner consistent with its current ratings. The ratings incorporate Fitch's expectations that the company's share repurchases and M&A; activity will likely exceed FCF generation given strong liquidity and the current credit profile. Leading Market Positions and Leveragability: Disney has a very consistent investment strategy centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and content that is leverageable across Disney's various platforms. Disney is uniquely positioned, relative to its peers, to capitalize and monetize its internally or externally developed franchises and brands, which in turn strengthens its operating and credit profile and provides Disney with a sustainable competitive advantage. Strength of Cable Networks: Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks, ESPN in particular, underpin the company's ratings. Fitch believes that the top-tier channels will continue to be a must-carry for the distributors and are likely to retain pricing power. Notwithstanding moderate subscriber declines, Disney's operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation characteristics attributable to its cable network business. Fitch expects this segment will continue to generate a significant amount of Disney's cash flow. Credible Strategy to Address Threats: Disney's strong asset portfolio positions the company to address the secular threats and opportunities presented by alternative distribution platforms such as OTT services and digital multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs), and continued audience fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. Though the broadcasting and media industry continue to feel the pressure of subscriber losses, Fitch believes Disney has the appropriate levers in place and investment strategy to address changing consumer habits. DERIVATION SUMMARY Overall, the ratings reflect the company's leading market positions within its core businesses. Further, Disney has a very consistent investment strategy that is centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and content that is leverageable across its various platforms (cable and broadcast network, studio, parks and resorts, and consumer products). Disney's cable networks generate the largest portion of total revenue and EBITDA, resulting in incremental stability in the total revenue and FCF profile. Secular issues such as the stagnant multi-channel video subscriber base and its effect on affiliate fee revenue, rising programming costs, particularly sports programming, the impact of foreign exchange, and Disney's ability to pass the higher costs on to multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs) will remain a significant risk to the company's operating profile. However, Fitch believes that Disney is in a strong position to retain pricing power going forward, as its collection of top-tier cable networks continue to command audience and ratings and be a must-carry for the MVPDs. In addition, Disney has, in large part, successfully matched the tenor of its long-term sports programming rights with the terms of its various affiliation agreements with the MVPDs. The ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the company's businesses, particularly Parks & Resorts, Consumer Products & Interactive Media, and the advertising portion of broadcast and cable networks. Should macroeconomic volatility return, Fitch expects these cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure but that the company's credit and financial profile will likely remain within expectations for the current ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's expectations are based on the agency's internally produced, conservative rating case forecasts. They do not represent the forecasts of rated issuers individually or in aggregate. Key Fitch forecast assumptions include: --Revenue growth within the company's cable networks business (Disney's Media Networks segment) reflects the stability of the business and modest affiliation-fee increases partially offset by subscriber losses. Long-term contracts and built-in price escalators support affiliation-fee growth. The base case assumes cable revenue growth in the low-single digits for the balance of the forecast. --Disney's broadcasting business benefits from a stable economic and advertising environment while incorporating a typical political advertising revenue cycle. Additionally, this segment will benefit from growing retransmission consent fees. Revenue growth ranges between 2% during nonpolitical years and 3%-4% during political years. --Domestic revenues grow faster than International revenues within the company's Parks and Resort segment in fiscal 2018 and 2019 when Avatar Land and Star Wars Land open. The base case assumes domestic revenues grow approximately 6% during the forecast period while international revenues grow 5% after a significant bump in 2016-2017 following the opening of Shanghai Disney Land. --Fitch expects a single-digit decline within Disney's Studio Entertainment segment in 2017 due to fewer releases and difficult prior year comps with respect to home entertainment (i.e. Star Wars). Television and SVOD revenues grow at a mid-single-digit pace while home entertainment revenues remain flat-to-down single digits. Growth is expected to resume in 2018 based on a strong film slate and anticipated home releases tracking the success of the film slate. --Consumer products and Interactive Media segment revenue growth assumptions remain in the mid-single-digit range in 2017-2019; 2016 benefits from licensing of Star Wars. --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes margin contraction within the company's Media Networks segment as subscriber losses and increased sports programming costs offset affiliate growth. Fitch believes there is potential for margin expansion if OTT and digital MVPDs are successful and will more than offset subscriber losses. Disney's investments within its Parks and Resort segment lead to higher margins within its domestic business in 2019-2020. Studio Entertainment margins beyond 2017 remain relatively consistent with 2016, generating double digit margins. A weaker film slate and fewer releases in 2017 are expected to pressure margins. --Scheduled debt maturities are refinanced upon maturity. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term. However a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration. Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary actions of Disney's management rather than by operating performance, reflecting the company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will likely lead to a negative rating action. LIQUIDITY Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and are supported by significant FCF generation as well as $7 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity, as of July 1, 2017, under three credit facilities. Commitments under these credit facilities support the company's $7 billion CP program and expire during March 2018 ($2.5 billion), March 2019 ($2.25 billion) and March 2021 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had approximately $4.3 billion of cash on hand as of July 1, 2017. Scheduled maturities are well-laddered and manageable considering FCF generation expectations and access to capital markets. Disney has approximately $1.8 billion of debt that is scheduled to mature during fiscal 2018 followed by $2.8 billion during fiscal 2019. Fitch does not expect debt reduction going forward. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Disney as follows: The Walt Disney Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'; --Senior unsecured revolvers 'A'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A' category-investment-grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial policies and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if it perceived heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

1385,DIS,Battle with Thor kicks off three-movie arc for Marvel's Hulk,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Marvel’s big green Hulk may not be getting his own standalone movie but actor Mark Ruffalo, who plays the current iteration of the superhero, said the character will get a mini arc within three upcoming Marvel movies.  Hulk, the muscle-bound, larger-than-life green alter-ego of scientist Bruce Banner, appears in the upcoming “Thor: Ragnarok,” out in U.S. theaters on Nov. 3, as a gladiator trapped on a futuristic planet and forced to fight Thor.  The Hulk will also appear in 2018’s “Avengers: Infinity War” and its sequel, 2019’s yet-to-be-titled Avengers 4. “We’ve taken the arc of a standalone Hulk movie and put it into those three movies, consciously,” Ruffalo said.  Ruffalo, who has spent more time as scientist Banner than as the Hulk in the past two Avengers films, said he relished the opportunity to be in character as the Hulk for the majority of “Thor: Ragnarok.” “This movie is about just breaking free of the forms and rules, and so I got to break free from what we thought Hulk was to a slightly more fleshed-out character,” he said.  The Hulk, who first appeared in comics in 1962, has had his own standalone television shows and movies in the past, notably 2003’s “Hulk” and 2008’s “The Incredible Hulk” films, both from Universal Pictures.   The cinematic rights to Marvel’s Hulk superhero are owned by Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) Universal Pictures, while Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) owns Marvel studios and is behind the current success of the superhero movie franchise.  “Ultimately Universal owns the rights there. I don’t see them like hanging out together any time soon to be like ‘Hey, let’s do another Hulk movie’,” he said.

1386,DIS,"UPDATE 3-Netflix adds more subscribers than expected, shares hit record","(Reuters) - Netflix Inc added more subscribers than expected around the world in the third quarter and projected growth in line with Wall Street forecasts, saying it had a head start on rivals as internet television explodes globally. Shares of the world’s leading online video streaming service touched a record high on Monday and rose a further 1.2 percent after hours to $205.07. They are up about 64 percent this year. For the third quarter, Netflix added 5.3 million subscribers in all its markets, compared with Wall Street’s target of 4.5 million, according to FactSet. Netflix forecast 6.3 million additions for the current quarter, just above analysts’ average estimate of 6.25 million, which would bring its global customer base to nearly 115.6 million. The company known for original TV shows such as “House of Cards” is spending heavily to produce and acquire content as it races to dominate streaming television in international markets, which now account for the majority of its subscriber growth.  In its quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix said it would boost its content budget to between $7 billion and $8 billion in 2018.     “As we move into 2018, we aim to achieve steady improvement in international profitability and a growing operating margin as our success in many large markets helps fund investments throughout Asia and the rest of the world,” the letter said. Investors have been bullish on Netflix’s ability to keep signing up customers around the world despite new rivals. Netflix recently traded at 101 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, versus Amazon.com Inc at 144 times earnings and Time Warner Inc at 16 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company faces increasing competition from streaming services such as Amazon.com’s Prime Video, plus moves by traditional media companies. Walt Disney Co decided to yank its first-run movies from Netflix in the United States starting in 2019, and to launch its own online offering. Netflix, in its investor letter, said Disney’s decision underlined the need to keep building its slate of exclusive original content. “We have a good head start but our job is to improve Netflix as rapidly as possible,” the company said. But Hastings said on a webcast it was “extremely unlikely” that Netflix would bid on The Weinstein Company if the opportunity arose. The film production company is in talks to sell the bulk of its assets to Colony Capital following the firing of co-founder Harvey Weinstein. Netflix distributes some Weinstein Company movies and TV shows on its streaming service but the business is not material, Netflix Chief Creative Officer Ted Sarandos said on the webcast.  Netflix’s 5.3 million additional subscribers in the third quarter included 4.45 million in international markets and 850,000 in the United States. Wall Street had expected 4.5 million overall, with 3.69 million overseas and 810,000 in the United States, according to FactSet. Revenue rose about 30 percent to $2.99 billion in the third quarter. Net income rose to $130 million, or 29 cents per share, in the latest quarter from $52 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.

1387,DIS,AIG sues Disney to avoid paying 'pink slime' settlement costs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) on Thursday sued Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to avoid having to reimburse the parent of ABC News for part of a settlement of a meat producer’s defamation lawsuit over a product that critics call “pink slime.” In a complaint filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, AIG Specialty Insurance Co urged a judge to reject Disney’s $25 million reimbursement demand, related to its larger June 28 settlement with Beef Products Inc (BPI), under an insurance policy that excluded coverage for claims alleging malice. Thursday’s lawsuit stemmed from BPI’s lawsuit against ABC and reporter Jim Avila over reports in March and April 2012. According to the privately held South Dakota company, these reports falsely implied that BPI’s “lean, finely textured beef” was not safe, nutritious or even meat. AIG said in its lawsuit that Disney’s policy covered some defamation claims, but only if the company had first found an outside lawyer to say the statements it planned to broadcast were acceptable. The New York-based insurer accused Disney of trying to “create coverage where none exists.” AIG filed its lawsuit nine days after Burbank, California-based Disney sued the insurer in Los Angeles federal court, seeking to send the dispute into arbitration. Lawyers for Disney in the Los Angeles case did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. ABC and BPI did not disclose terms of their settlement, which ended a jury trial. But in an Aug. 8 regulatory filing, Disney said it had incurred $177 million of costs, in addition to what insurance covered, to settle litigation during the second quarter.

1388,DIS,AIG sues Disney to avoid paying 'pink slime' settlement costs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) on Thursday sued Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to avoid having to reimburse the parent of ABC News for part of a settlement of a meat producer’s defamation lawsuit over a product that critics call “pink slime.” In a complaint filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, AIG Specialty Insurance Co urged a judge to reject Disney’s $25 million reimbursement demand, related to its larger June 28 settlement with Beef Products Inc (BPI), under an insurance policy that excluded coverage for claims alleging malice. Thursday’s lawsuit stemmed from BPI’s lawsuit against ABC and reporter Jim Avila over reports in March and April 2012. According to the privately held South Dakota company, these reports falsely implied that BPI’s “lean, finely textured beef” was not safe, nutritious or even meat. AIG said in its lawsuit that Disney’s policy covered some defamation claims, but only if the company had first found an outside lawyer to say the statements it planned to broadcast were acceptable. The New York-based insurer accused Disney of trying to “create coverage where none exists.” AIG filed its lawsuit nine days after Burbank, California-based Disney sued the insurer in Los Angeles federal court, seeking to send the dispute into arbitration. Lawyers for Disney in the Los Angeles case did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. ABC and BPI did not disclose terms of their settlement, which ended a jury trial. But in an Aug. 8 regulatory filing, Disney said it had incurred $177 million of costs, in addition to what insurance covered, to settle litigation during the second quarter. Several media reports have said the BPI settlement was for a larger amount. BPI had said ABC’s reports forced it to close plants and lay off several hundred workers. It had sought $1.9 billion of damages, which could have been tripled to $5.7 billion under a South Dakota “food products disparagement” law.

1389,DIS,Fox held talks to sell most of company to Disney: CNBC,"(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox has held talks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co, which would gain new programming and expand its international reach, CNBC reported on Monday. Fox’s shares jumped 9.9 percent to close at $27.45 on Nasdaq, and Disney shares climbed 2.0 percent to $100.64 on the New York Stock Exchange. The two sides are not currently talking, but had held talks in the last few weeks, CNBC reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The discussions reflect a view among Fox executives that the media company could not reach the size needed to compete with Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and other major media players, according to CNBC. cnb.cx/2hgHcPA Representatives of Disney and Fox had no comment. For Disney, a deal could bring additional programming it could use to lure audiences as the company tries to navigate consumers’ rapid migration to digital viewing and compete with heavy spending by technology companies pushing further into Hollywood. It also could extend Disney’s reach into international markets.  Disney, which under U.S. rules could not own two broadcast networks, would not purchase all of Fox, CNBC reported. It would not seek to buy Fox’s sports programming assets for fear of running foul of antitrust laws with its own ESPN network, and also would not buy Fox News or Fox’s broadcast network or local broadcasting affiliates, the report said.  It did discuss buying Fox’s movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic and international assets such as the Star network in India and European pay TV provider Sky Plc, CNBC said.  Fox has bid $14.5 billion to acquire the remaining 61 percent of Sky it does not own, but the acquisition has been delayed by British regulators. “I see lots of synergies for Disney. It’s a no-brainer,” Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. “The confusion is what it means for Fox.” Traditional media giants are scrambling to increase their scale and add new businesses, particularly after AT&T;’s bid for HBO and CNN owner Time Warner Inc, which is awaiting regulatory approval. Other media companies also could be interested in Fox’s assets, Wieser said. Credit Suisse analysts said the talks increase uncertainty around the Sky transaction. Disney may want Sky as part of an international streaming strategy, but a deal also would  deepen its exposure to traditional businesses that have been under pressure. “It is not clear whether the main Disney shareholders will agree and give their support to management on this point,” the analysts said in a research note. Disney has been struggling with subscriber declines at ESPN, its biggest network, and is planning to launch direct-to-consumer video streaming services to reach younger audiences that have shunned traditional cable and satellite offerings. Chief Executive Bob Iger has said he plans to retire from Disney in July 2019, and the company is searching for a successor. Much of Fox’s revenue has come from its cable division, which houses Fox News, FX and other channels. Fox said in August that it expects to see high single-digit domestic affiliate fee growth every quarter in fiscal 2018.

1395,DIS,Sky investor Odey opposes Fox bid as Disney talks fuel uncertainty,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investor Crispin Odey said he opposed Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) $15 billion bid for Sky (SKYB.L) after a report of separate talks between Rupert Murdoch and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) added more uncertainty to a takeover facing regulatory hurdles. Veteran hedge fund manager Odey, whose firm has a 0.9 percent Sky stake according to Thomson Reuters data, said that Fox’s 10.75 pound-a-share bid “starts to look like it’s not a very good price” for the European pay-TV broadcaster. Odey’s opposition to the 11.7 billion-pound ($15.4 billion) takeover comes after CNBC reported that Murdoch’s Fox had recently held talks about selling some assets to Disney. That scenario added to the potential obstacles to the Sky deal which faces an in-depth regulatory investigation and strong opposition from some British politicians. “I’d vote against the deal,” Odey told Reuters on Tuesday, when asked about Fox’s offer for the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own. He added: “The interesting thing is: can Sky survive happily without Fox? I think it can quite happily.” Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch, had initially backed the Fox bid for Sky, which was announced in December. But in August he told Reuters that he thought the offer was beginning to “look rather mean”, although he stopped short of saying he would oppose it.  Sky shares traded 1.2 percent lower at 928 pence by 1520 GMT on Tuesday, well below the bid price. Odey said that he had changed his mind because Sky’s financial results have been “much better than people forecast” , since the offer was made. Last month, the British broadcaster posted an 11 percent rise in core earnings to 582 million pounds for the three months to the end of September. Odey’s comments come after CNBC said that Disney recently discussed buying Fox’s movie and TV production studio studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic and international assets such as the Star network in India and its stake in Sky. The talks were not currently ongoing, the broadcaster said. Analysts at Liberum said they still saw a successful conclusion of Fox’s bid for Sky as the most likely outcome, but the Disney-Fox talks had thrown a curveball into the mix. They said Fox may scrap its bid for Sky as part of a proposed sale of assets, and they also noted that Fox’s willingness to consider including the Sky stake in any sale could be seen as a signal that it feels less confident of gaining regulatory approval from the British government. UBS, however, said a combination of Disney and Fox content could strengthen the rationale for buying all of Sky. The British company was already starting to build a pan-European streaming platform with its Now TV and Sky Ticket products, and the addition of content from Disney as well as Fox would only make that more compelling, it said. The bank also said in the event that a Fox/Sky deal was blocked, based on the CNBC article, Disney could be a potential strategic bidder for Sky and it noted it would not have the cross-media complications of a Fox bid.

1400,DIS,Fox in the Mouse House could give Disney an edge in streaming wars,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - If Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) buys some Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) businesses, it could provide a quick path for the traditional media giant to create a substantial competitor to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) in the battle for TV and movie viewers. The two companies reportedly held talks in recent weeks about a potential sale of Fox’s FX and National Geographic channels, its movie studio and some other international assets to Disney, according to media reports. The discussions had stopped as of Monday but could restart, the reports said. Television viewers have been rapidly embracing online services like Netflix over traditional pay TV packages, a shift that is enticing deep-pocketed technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) into video offerings. Investors who have driven Netflix shares to record highs this year were selling on Tuesday, sending the company’s stock down more than 2 percent. Disney and Fox shares rose roughly 1 percent each as analysts said a deal between the two media giants could benefit Disney’s planned streaming push. “It could be very formidable,” said Bruce Tuchman, a media investor, entrepreneur and adviser to streaming services like iflix. “They wouldn’t have to leave the confines of their own company to build a competitive service.” Disney announced in August it was pulling its first-run movies from Netflix starting in 2019 to put them on a Disney-branded service.  With Fox, Disney in the future could yank Fox programming from Netflix and put shows like “The Simpsons” and movie franchises including “Avatar” alongside Disney classics such as “Beauty and the Beast” plus “Star Wars” and Marvel films.  That would leave a hole in Netflix. Fox made up 17 percent of Netflix’s top-rated shows by IMDb as of June, while Disney made up 7 percent, according to MoffettNathanson and YipitData.  Disney and Fox also each own roughly 25 percent of streaming service Hulu, which could serve as another platform for content.  Disney, Fox and Netflix had no comment. In August, Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, told Reuters that his company was investing more in its own programming to counter moves by traditional media companies.  “That’s why we got into the originals business five years ago, anticipating it may be not as easy a conversation with studios and networks” to license their programming, Sarandos said. Netflix plans to spend $8 billion on content next year, the company has said. Disney spent $13.5 billion on content in fiscal 2017, about half of it on sports programming, according to MoffettNathanson estimates. Disney will be starting its online service more than a decade after Netflix, which now boasts 109 million streaming customers around the world. Disney could expand its global reach if it acquires Fox TV channel Star India and the company’s stake in European pay TV provider Sky Plc (SKYB.L), which already has made inroads in the streaming market. Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin said Disney needs to buy a film library from Fox or another big company to compete directly with Netflix. “Disney’s libraries are very high quality, but they are very small,” Martin said. “They could not do it alone.” ",11082017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-walt-disney-netflix-fox-analysis/fox-in-the-mouse-house-could-give-disney-an-edge-in-streaming-wars-idUSKBN1D801X
1401,DIS,UPDATE 2-Twenty-First Century Fox's quarterly revenue beats Street,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) quarterly revenue topped market estimates on Wednesday as higher sales from traditional and online distributors boosted its cable business. The Rupert Murdoch-controlled company’s shares were up nearly 1 percent in extended trading. The first-quarter results come after CNBC reported on Monday that Fox had, in the last few weeks, held talks about selling most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). The two sides are not currently in discussion, CNBC had reported. At the beginning of a call with analysts, Fox’s Chairman Lachlan Murdoch, without naming Disney, said that the company would not respond to any questions regarding recent media reports. However when asked if Fox was the right size or had the right set of assets, CEO James Murdoch said he liked the brands the company has. “These are big brands that really matter for their customers and we like where we are,” he said. The reported talks with Disney adds another layer of uncertainty to Fox’s bid to buy the rest the nearly 61 percent of European pay-TV group Sky Plc (SKYB.L) it does not already own in an offer worth $14.5 billion made in December. The offer is being closely scrutinized by the British government. Nevertheless, Fox said Wednesday it expects the deal to close by June 30, 2018.  Revenue from Fox’s cable division, which houses the Fox News and FX channels among others, rose 10 percent to $4.20 billion. That beat analysts’ average estimate of $4.12 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Domestic affiliate revenue, which consists of sales from its traditional and online distributors, jumped 11 percent. Affiliate sales helped offset an 11 percent increase in expenses, primarily due to higher global sports programming costs. In September, Fox’s Star India bid $2.55 billion for the television and streaming rights combined to a hugely popular cricket tournament in India. Fox expects those rights to add 2 percent of cost growth and revenue in the fourth quarter, Fox told analysts. Despite that increase, Fox said it was not concerned about the increasing cost of sports rights.  Fox said revenue rose to $7.00 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, higher than the $6.51 billion a year earlier and the $6.81 billion analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1403,DIS,UPDATE 1-'Last Jedi' director Rian Johnson to oversee new 'Star Wars' trilogy,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The galaxy far, far away is expanding further on screen with a new trilogy of “Star Wars” films outside of the ongoing Skywalker saga, Walt Disney Co said Thursday, to be overseen by Rian Johnson, the director of the franchise’s upcoming film “The Last Jedi.” Johnson, 43, will write and direct the first of a new “Star Wars” trilogy that will bring new characters and worlds not yet explored on screen, Disney said.  “He’s a creative force, and watching him craft ‘The Last Jedi’ from start to finish was one of the great joys of my career. Rian will do amazing things with the blank canvas of this new trilogy,” Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, said in a statement.  Disney said no release dates have been set for the new trilogy. In addition to the new film trilogy, Disney’s CEO Bob Iger said during the company’s quarterly earnings call on Thursday that a “Star Wars” live-action TV series was also being developed for the company’s upcoming streaming service.

1404,DIS,Tech stocks tug Wall Street lower; investors fret about U.S. tax cut delays,"(Reuters) - Wall Street stocks dropped on Thursday, weighed down by losses in Microsoft and other technology issues, as investors turned their attention to a U.S. Senate Republican plan that would delay expected corporate tax cuts.   The S&P; 500 index has surged about 21 percent since the election of President Donald Trump a year ago, fueled by his promises to cut corporate taxes and other business-friendly measures. Senate Republicans are unveiling a tax proposal that differs markedly on corporate, business and individual tax cuts from legislation detailed by their counterparts in the House of Representatives, Republican aides said. The Senate proposal delays a corporate tax rate cut to 20 percent by a year and provides small-business owners with a deduction rather than a special business rate, said the aides. Earlier on Thursday, uncertainty about the future of corporate tax rates pushed the S&P; 500 down as much 1.0 percent, underscoring how much Wall Street is banking on a tax reduction., but the selloff was brief and stocks quickly recovered much of the dip. The S&P; 500 is trading at 18 times expected earnings, expensive compared with its 10-year average of 14.3, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Cutting corporate taxes would boost earnings and make stocks relatively less expensive. “It’s been a year since the election. We’ve gone up 22 percent on hopes of what the Trump agenda would bring, and while they’re trying to work toward this thing, they haven’t really accomplished much yet,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “If progress is not made, the equity market should either pause or correct until meaningful progress is made.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI lost 0.43 percent to end at 23,461.94, while the S&P; 500 .SPX declined 0.38 percent to 2,584.62. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.58 percent to 6,750.05. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX, a top performer in 2017. Six of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors fell, with industrials .SPLRCI down 1.28 percent and the technology .SPLRCT index off 0.85 percent. Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Oracle (ORCL.N) and Facebook (FB.O) were among the stocks weighing most on the S&P; 500. Technology has been the best-performing S&P; 500 sector so far this year, with a 37 percent rise. The sector’s stretched valuations make it vulnerable to selling as investors worry that promised tax reductions might not emerge.  Roku (ROKU.O) soared 55 percent after the video streaming device maker’s quarterly results and guidance beat expectations. Macy’s (M.N) jumped 10.98 percent after the department store operator’s profit came in above expectations. In extended trade, Nordstrom dropped 1.0 percent after that retailer reported quarterly sales short of analysts’ expectations. Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) lost 2.0 percent after the bell following its quarterly report while chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O) rose nearly 2.0 percent after its report. During the session, Dish Network (DISH.O) rose 3.22 percent after the satellite and internet TV provider added subscribers in the United States in the third quarter and reduced the rate at which it lost existing customers. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.67-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored decliners. About 7.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

1407,DIS,Disney reports 2.8 percent fall in quarterly revenue,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co reported a 2.8 percent drop in quarterly revenue on Thursday, weighed down by the lack of any major box office releases, sending the company’s shares down about 3 percent in extended trading. Disney’s revenue fell to $12.78 billion in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 from $13.14 billion a year earlier. Net income attributable to the company declined to $1.75 billion from $1.77 billion. The results come after CNBC reported on Monday that Disney had, in the last few weeks, held talks about buying most of Twenty-First Century Fox’s film and television assets. The two sides are not currently in discussion, CNBC had reported. Disney did not address the report in its earnings release.

1409,DIS,Disney shares rise as focus turns to streaming commitment,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney’s (DIS.N) shares rose 3 percent on Friday, as Wall Street shrugged off poor financial results and focused instead on the media giant’s commitment to build a service that will compete aggressively with video streaming pioneer Netflix. Disney’s sharper focus on streaming comes amid subscriber losses at its legacy cable networks that include ESPN and ABC, which many viewers are deserting for cheaper, on-demand streaming options. On Thursday, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger talked up his commitment to streaming, calling it the company’s “highest priority this year.” In a step that will further cement Disney’s strong position as a content powerhouse, Iger also unveiled a deal to develop a new “Star Wars” trilogy. Perhaps more importantly, Iger said Disney’s planned streaming service would be “substantially” cheaper than Netflix. Analysts said the lower price likely reflected Disney’s relatively smaller content slate but that the move could help the service gain subscribers quickly. “We think Disney wants strong uptake early on and that this move recognizes that the equity market rewards strong (streaming) subscriber growth,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall said. To compete better with Netflix and other streaming services, Disney has also said it will keep new Disney releases out of Netflix, starting from 2019. Disney was making all the right strategic decisions as it builds out the streaming business, Evercore ISI’s Vijay Jayant said. The company is developing family-friendly streaming services that will sell directly to consumers. It will launch a sports-focused service called ESPN Plus in early 2018. According to news reports, Disney has held talks in recent weeks about a potential acquisition of most of Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) media assets including FX, National Geographic and its movie studio. While Iger declined to comment on the speculation on Thursday, analysts said a deal could help Disney expand its content library as it prepares to launch the streaming service.

1411,DIS,US STOCKS-Wall St falls on tax bill worries; media stocks climb,"* All three major indexes on track to post weekly losses * Walt Disney gains; top boost on the Dow * Nvidia rises as revenue forecast tops estimates * Indexes down: Dow 0.19 pct, S&P; 0.24 pct, Nasdaq 0.22 pct (Adds details, changes comment, updates prices) By Tanya Agrawal Nov 10 (Reuters) - Wall Street declined on Friday as the markets grappled with concerns over delays in corporate tax cuts but a rise in media stocks helped limit the slide. Walt Disney rose 2.9 percent as the promise of a new film trilogy overshadowed weak quarterly results and struggles at the media company. The stock was the biggest boost on the Dow. Disney held talks in recent weeks about buying some of Twenty-First Century Fox’s film and TV businesses, according to media reports. Twenty-First Century Fox, Time Warner Inc, Comcast and News Corp were all up between 1.4 percent and 6.1 percent and were among the top boosts on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Senate Republicans have unveiled a tax-cut plan that would delay lowering corporate rate to 20 percent by a year and provide small-business owners with a deduction rather than a special business rate. The Senate Republicans’ version of the bill differs markedly on corporate, business and individual tax cuts from legislation detailed by their counterparts in the House of Representatives. The S&P; 500 index has surged more than 20 percent since the 2016 presidential election, fueled by Donald Trump’s promises. All three major indexes were on track to end lower for the week, with the S&P; and the Dow on track to post weekly losses after eight straight weeks of gains. “When you get to the end of the earnings season, the focus shifts from the micro to the macro, in this case, the tax bill,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. “The concerns over the differences between the Senate and House version of the tax bill is causing some consolidation in the market. It’s a pretty tight time frame for the passage of the bill and I think it will be an event for the first quarter.” At 10:47 a.m. ET (1447 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 43.85 points, or 0.19 percent, at 23,418.09, the S&P; 500 was down 6.28 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,578.34. The Nasdaq Composite was down 15.06 points, or 0.22 percent, at 6,734.99. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the healthcare index’s 1.17 percent fall leading the decliners. Earnings for the third quarter are expected to have climbed 8 percent, compared with expectations of a 5.9 percent rise at the start of October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Nvidia were up 5.5 percent after the chipmaker’s revenue forecast for the current quarter topped estimates. Nordstrom fell 2.1 percent after its quarterly same-store sales came in below expectations, while J.C. Penney was up 12.7 percent after the department store chain reported third-quarter same-store sales that were twice what it had estimated. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,432 to 1,244. On the Nasdaq, 1,455 issues rose and 1,209 fell.

1414,DIS,New 'Star Wars' trilogy raises hopes after Disney results miss target,"(Reuters) - The force of “Star Wars” lifted Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) shares on Thursday as the promise of a new film trilogy overshadowed disappointing quarterly results and struggles at the media company’s television business. The storied movie studio and theme park operator is scrambling to keep viewers who are abandoning its current top money maker, cable networks. The power of its characters and brands are the reason many investors stick with the company despite its challenges. Disney shares rose more than 1 percent after Chief Executive Bob Iger said Disney had struck a deal with Rian Johnson, director of upcoming film “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” to create a new trilogy in the blockbuster science fiction series. A live-action “Star Wars” TV series also is being developed for a streaming service that Disney is launching to capture online audiences, Iger said.  Disney shares rose about 1 percent from their Thursday closing price to $103.57 after the “Star Wars” announcements, reversing an initial falloff after Disney’s results raised concerns about cable subscriptions.  Subscribers and advertising revenue both fell at ESPN, the sports powerhouse that is seen as a proxy for Disney’s ability to fight the rapid migration of audiences to online viewing. Affiliate revenue rose and overall results at ESPN were comparable to the prior year for the quarter that ended in September, Disney said. Total revenue from Disney’s cable business, the largest unit which includes ESPN and the Disney Channel, fell marginally to $3.95 billion in the fourth quarter, missing the $4.06 billion consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. To address challenges in its TV networks business, Disney is developing family-friendly streaming services that it will sell directly to consumers to compete with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and other rivals. Building those businesses tops the company’s agenda for the next year, Iger told analysts on a conference call. “We believe creating a direct-to-consumer relationship is vital to the future of our media businesses, and it’s our highest priority this year,” he said. New Disney releases will go to the company’s own service rather than Netflix, starting in 2019, and Iger on Thursday said the new service would be priced “substantially below” Netflix, a reflection of having less content. Disney’s sports-focused service will launch in early 2018 and will be called ESPN Plus, Iger said. Investors remain concerned about Disney’s cable business and were buoyed by the potential of the “Star Wars” franchise and the pricing of the streaming service, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said. “The Last Jedi,” hitting theaters in December, could ring up $2 billion in global box office sales, he said. Disney shares have had a difficult year, falling roughly 1 percent, while the S&P; 500 has risen 15 percent.  Disney also held talks in recent weeks about buying some of Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) film and TV businesses, according to media reports, which could bring Disney more content to compete with Netflix and others. Disney did not comment on the Fox talks on the call with investors. Disney recently traded at 16 times expected earnings, compared with 14 times earnings for Time Warner and 13 times earnings for Fox, according to Thomson Reuters data. A two-day closing of Disney’s Florida resorts amid a hurricane and the cancellation of an animated movie were among one-time items that reduced operating income by about $275 million, or about 11 cents per share, the company said. Disney’s movie business generated revenue of $1.4 billion in the quarter, down about 21 percent and missing analysts’ average estimate of $1.61 billion.

1418,DIS,Fox shares rise on signs of more takeover interest,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc shares were up 3 percent in trading on Friday after sources said both Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc were interested in buying parts of its studio and TV operations.  A week after reports of interest from Walt Disney Co in buying out much of Rupert Murdoch’s U.S. film and television empire, the sources hinted at the prospect of a battle between other media suitors for the assets.     Buyers have expressed interest in Fox’s production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic, and international assets such as the Star network in India and Sky Plc, sources told Reuters on Thursday. “Either Disney or Comcast would be a good fit, but its always about price and neither has to be a strategic buyer, only opportunistic,” said JBL Advisors analyst Jeffrey Logsdon. Shares of other media companies which could be dragged into a round of consolidation of U.S. film and TV production and distribution were largely unchanged.  Comcast, the largest cable provider in the United States,  has steadily boosted its content ownership over the years and buying Fox’s assets would give it an international distribution footprint and strengthen its position against Disney. Traditional media companies have been struggling with subscriber declines as streaming service Netflix has gained traction with younger audiences that shun traditional cable and satellite offerings. Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser remains uncertain as to whether the Murdoch family is seriously entertaining offers. Wieser surmised that all the interest in Fox by other companies probably came after they heard something regarding Disney’s potential interest that was at least enough to take a meeting. “Previously, no-one would have guessed that such a meeting would have ever occurred. That’s enough for other companies to get their bankers working on something to attempt to get a meeting of their own,” he said. Verizon shares were up 1.4 percent, while Comcast and Netflix shares were down about 1 percent. Fox and Disney are partial co-owners of Hulu, a streaming service that offers on-demand and live TV packages. Hulu is also partially owned by Comcast and Time Warner Inc. “I think if Time Warner doesn’t end up being bought by AT&T; - it looks like that’s going to get blocked - that would be an interesting combination... Time Warner-Fox or Disney-Fox,” Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin told Reuters.  Although acquisition of a movie studio and cable channels would be a departure for wireless carrier Verizon, its interest in Fox assets was likely piqued by rival AT&T;’s bid for HBO and CNN owner Time Warner, which is awaiting regulatory approval. “(I am) skeptical of a Verizon deal, creative businesses are very tough to manage for an outsider,” Logsdon said. Fox’s other assets include Fox television network, Fox News Channel and Fox Entertainment Group, which owns the popular movies studio 20th Century Fox.

A week after reports of interest from Walt Disney Co in buying out much of Rupert Murdoch’s U.S. film and television empire, the sources hinted at the prospect of a battle between other media suitors for the assets.     Buyers have expressed interest in Fox’s production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic, and international assets such as the Star network in India and Sky Plc, sources told Reuters on Thursday. “Either Disney or Comcast would be a good fit, but its always about price and neither has to be a strategic buyer, only opportunistic,” said JBL Advisors analyst Jeffrey Logsdon. Shares of other media companies which could be dragged into a round of consolidation of U.S. film and TV production and distribution were largely unchanged.  Comcast, the largest cable provider in the United States,  has steadily boosted its content ownership over the years and buying Fox’s assets would give it an international distribution footprint and strengthen its position against Disney. Traditional media companies have been struggling with subscriber declines as streaming service Netflix has gained traction with younger audiences that shun traditional cable and satellite offerings. Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser remains uncertain as to whether the Murdoch family is seriously entertaining offers. Wieser surmised that all the interest in Fox by other companies probably came after they heard something regarding Disney’s potential interest that was at least enough to take a meeting. “Previously, no-one would have guessed that such a meeting would have ever occurred. That’s enough for other companies to get their bankers working on something to attempt to get a meeting of their own,” he said. Verizon shares were up 1.4 percent, while Comcast and Netflix shares were down about 1 percent. Fox and Disney are partial co-owners of Hulu, a streaming service that offers on-demand and live TV packages. Hulu is also partially owned by Comcast and Time Warner Inc. “I think if Time Warner doesn’t end up being bought by AT&T; - it looks like that’s going to get blocked - that would be an interesting combination... Time Warner-Fox or Disney-Fox,” Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin told Reuters.  Although acquisition of a movie studio and cable channels would be a departure for wireless carrier Verizon, its interest in Fox assets was likely piqued by rival AT&T;’s bid for HBO and CNN owner Time Warner, which is awaiting regulatory approval. “(I am) skeptical of a Verizon deal, creative businesses are very tough to manage for an outsider,” Logsdon said. Fox’s other assets include Fox television network, Fox News Channel and Fox Entertainment Group, which owns the popular movies studio 20th Century Fox. Fox shares have gained about 9 percent in value in the last six months.

1421,DIS,Disney-Pixar animation executive Lasseter takes leave after 'missteps': memo,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co executive John Lasseter, who heads animation at both Disney and Pixar, told company staff on Tuesday he was taking a six-month leave of absence following what he called “missteps” including unwanted hugs that made employees uncomfortable, according to a memo seen by Reuters. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them,” Lasseter said in the memo, in which he  apologized to employees who felt “disrespected or uncomfortable.” “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he added. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” A pioneer in computer animation, Lasseter has been the driving creative force behind Disney’s success in animated films over the past decade. He is an Oscar winner and chief creative officer of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios.  Disney said in a statement that it appreciated Lasseter’s “candor and sincere apology” and supported his leave of absence. “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work,” the company said.  Lasseter is the latest Hollywood figure to be accused of inappropriate behavior toward women since producer Harvey Weinstein was fired from his company in October after allegations of sexual assault and harassment. Weinstein has denied allegations of non-consensual sex. News of Lasseter’s decision to take a leave of absence was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter. The industry publication also published a story on Tuesday that said some women at Disney had been made uncomfortable by physical contact initiated by Lasseter. Disney did not respond to a request for comment on  allegations reported by The Hollywood Reporter. Lasseter did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment.  Lasseter, 60, joined the company in 2006 when Disney bought Pixar Animation Studios and named him chief creative officer of Disney Animation Studios. He has produced a number of  commercially successful films and been praised as a modern-day Walt Disney.  Part of Pixar’s founding team in 1996, Lasseter has overseen 11 movies that have won the Academy Award for best animated feature, including “Up,” “Finding Nemo” and “Frozen.”  Disney animation and Pixar films have sold roughly $14 billion worth of tickets worldwide since Lasseter joined Disney, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the Box Office Mojo website.  Lasseter directed the 1995 hit “Toy Story,” the first feature-length computer-animated film, which earned him an Oscar for special achievement, and has been credited with leading a resurgence of Disney Animation. The studio was revitalized with the 2013 musical “Frozen” and 2016 Oscar winner “Zootopia.”   In addition, Lasseter has served as principal creative adviser to Walt Disney Imagineering, the division that develops theme park attractions. He was instrumental in the design of Cars Land, the centerpiece of a 2012 redesign of Disney’s California Adventure park.

The investment would be the amusement park operator’s biggest since spending about 340 billion yen to open Tokyo DisneySea in 2001, the Nikkei business daily reported. Oriental Land is the Japanese operator of the Tokyo Disney Resort, which started with the opening of Tokyo Disneyland in 1983 in Urayasu on the outskirts of Tokyo.

Oriental Land plans to expand the resort’s 100 hectare site by about 30 percent and open new attractions around 2023, the newspaper said. The expansion plan is designed to alleviate the amusement park’s chronic congestion, it said.

1432,DIS,"Too cold for a theme park, Disney looks to toy stores in Russia","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Though too cold for a theme park, Russia’s underserved toy market makes it an attractive business prospect for Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), the head of its Russian operations said on Friday. Opening the U.S. group’s first toy store in the country, Marina Zhigalova-Ozkan said it planned at least five more, and was working with local manufacturers to keep prices competitive. “We think that in Russia there aren’t too many toy shops ... and we thought it would be interesting and complementary to what already exists in the market to open our own branded stores together with partners,” she said in an interview. The new outlet occupies around 300 square meters in the central Moscow children’s department store, alongside British toy retailer Hamleys, which opened two years ago. Three more Disney stores are planned for Moscow, one in St Petersburg and one in Russia’s south this and next year, Zhigalova-Ozkan said. Disney has teamed up with Russian company Ideas4Retail, which will run the stores and pay a royalty fee to Disney, with the two working together on product range and pricing. Ideas4Retail also works with Hamleys as well as children-focused brands Imaginarium and Mamas & Papas in Russia. Unlike Disney stores elsewhere, which also sell clothing and decor, shops in Russia will only sell toys and will represent the Disney, Star Wars, and Marvel franchises. Disney’s current Russian business focuses on distributing and producing cartoons and movies, and licensing its brands for use on a wide range of consumer goods and in digital content. It also has a joint venture with Russian company UTH, which owns Disney Channel in the country. Merchandise for the stores will be supplied by local manufacturers with licensing agreements with Disney, while some will be imported from other countries. Disney has around 300 licensees in Russia, of which 136 manufacture goods in Russia. Zhigalova-Ozkan said the company had been focusing on localizing production in recent years, and had stepped this up after the rouble fell sharply at the end of 2014. “Because of the (exchange) rate differences many of the products that we were bringing in became out of reach for the Russian consumer,” she said. “We have expanded the number of goods we sell at mid prices. We realize that the average spent may be lower but demand for children’s goods does not decline. Children want toys anyway.” However, Disney has no plans for a theme park in Russia. “Sadly, it’s cold in Russia. A theme park should work 12 months in a year. And in terms of number of people in Russia unfortunately it’s not very efficient,” Zhigalova-Ozkan said. Disney does not break down its business figures by countries.

1438,DIS,Disney's bid for Fox assets gains momentum: sources,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is in the lead to acquire much of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) media empire, though rival suitor Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) remains in contention, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.  The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, prefers a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, one of the sources said. However, no deal between Disney and Fox is imminent and several issues have yet to be fully negotiated, the sources said. The Reuters sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Fox and Comcast declined to comment, while Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fox is exploring a potential sale as it is has been considered undervalued relative to its peers, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.  “At the beginning of this year, Fox was the only buy-rated stock I had because it was so depressed relative to everything else in the sector,” Wieser said.  Fox Chief Executive James Murdoch, speaking at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York on Tuesday, declined to comment on reports about a potential sale. “It’s always good to look at what’s going to create the most value for our shareholders,” he told attendees.  CNBC had reported earlier on Tuesday that a deal for Disney to buy Fox’s movie studio and television production assets for more than $60 billion could come as early as next week. Fox shares were up 0.57 percent in late afternoon trading, while Disney was down 2.45 percent. Comcast shares were down 1.56 percent.  Disney, which has a market value of around $166 billion, would acquire Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, the Star network in India and stake in European pay-TV provider Sky PLC (SKYB.L).  Fox anticipates that its deal to buy the remaining 61 percent stake of Sky, which has been held up by regulators, will be approved in the first half of 2018. Any deal for Fox would include the remaining stake of Sky, sources have told Reuters.  Fox would keep its news and business news divisions, its broadcast stations and Fox Sports, the sources said.

1440,DIS,UPDATE 3-Disney's bid for Fox assets gains momentum -sources,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is in the lead to acquire much of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) media empire, though rival suitor Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) remains in contention, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.  The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, prefers a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, one of the sources said. However, no deal between Disney and Fox is imminent and several issues have yet to be fully negotiated, the sources said. The Reuters sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Fox and Comcast declined to comment, while Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fox is exploring a potential sale as it is has been considered undervalued relative to its peers, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.  “At the beginning of this year, Fox was the only buy-rated stock I had because it was so depressed relative to everything else in the sector,” Wieser said.  Fox Chief Executive James Murdoch, speaking at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York on Tuesday, declined to comment on reports about a potential sale. “It’s always good to look at what’s going to create the most value for our shareholders,” he told attendees.  CNBC had reported earlier on Tuesday that a deal for Disney to buy Fox’s movie studio and television production assets for more than $60 billion could come as early as next week. Fox shares were up 0.57 percent in late afternoon trading, while Disney was down 2.45 percent. Comcast shares were down 1.56 percent.  Disney, which has a market value of around $166 billion, would acquire Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, the Star network in India and stake in European pay-TV provider Sky PLC (SKYB.L).  Fox anticipates that its deal to buy the remaining 61 percent stake of Sky, which has been held up by regulators, will be approved in the first half of 2018. Any deal for Fox would include the remaining stake of Sky, sources have told Reuters.  Fox would keep its news and business news divisions, its broadcast stations and Fox Sports, the sources said. Reuters reported in November that Comcast, which is the largest U.S. cable provider and has a market value of around $188 billion, had expressed interest in Fox assets.

1441,DIS,US STOCKS-Wall Street wavers as Disney falls and tech rebounds,"* Fox shares rise after report Disney deal likely soon * Toll Brothers slips after downbeat order growth, results * McDonald’s boosts Dow after Jefferies upgrade * Indexes: Dow -0.15 pct, S&P; -0.02 pct, Nasdaq +0.33 pct (Updates to afternoon) By Noel Randewich Dec 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street treaded water on Tuesday as Microsoft and other technology stocks rebounded and Walt Disney Co fell, while investors assessed how a Republican tax overhaul would impact corporate earnings. Microsoft rose 1.27 percent, helping push the S&P; information technology index up 0.76 percent. This year’s top-performing sector remains down about 3 percent since it has sold off over the past week, with investors reallocating money to banks, retailers and other stocks seen winning most from tax cuts promised by President Donald Trump. The bill passed on Saturday by Republican senators included a last-minute change retaining the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT, which had initially been removed. That put Senate Republicans on a collision course with Republicans in the House of Representatives, whose own tax bill repealed the corporate AMT and who are already calling for the tax to be eliminated in the final legislation. Including the AMT could negate parts of the bill seen as beneficial to tech companies and other corporations. “Sentiment still remains that tax reform will get done and we will get a 20-percent tax rate, and that will boost earnings significantly,” said Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA Research. At 2:15 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.15 percent at 24,252.89 points, while the S&P; 500 had lost 0.02 percent to 2,638.86. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.33 percent to 6,797.42. Eight of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, led by losses in telecom services and utilities. Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox climbed 0.6 percent after a report that Walt Disney was in the lead to acquire much of Fox’s media empire, though rival suitor Comcast remained in contention. Disney shares fell 2.2 percent and Comcast also slipped 1.4 percent. McDonald’s rose 1.43 percent, providing the biggest boost to the Dow, after Jefferies upgraded the stock with a “buy” rating. Toll Brothers fell 7.4 percent after the luxury homebuilder’s profit and revenue missed analysts’ expectations as it sold homes at prices lower than its own estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

1446,DIS,Breakingviews - The Force could be with Disney-Fox deal," NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Force could be with a Walt Disney deal for Twenty-First Century Fox. The Magic Kingdom is getting close to buying parts of Rupert Murdoch’s $60 billion empire, according to news reports. Disney would add to its clout with global outlets and cable content. The Murdoch family, meanwhile, may fancy shares in a bigger group. A deal could help with succession problems at both companies, too.  The acquisition would include assets like Fox’s FX cable network, movie studios, and global properties such as Star India and its 39 percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky. All in, the enterprise value of the deal could be more than $60 billion, according to CNBC.  Add Fox’s net debt to its market value, and its current EV is around $76 billion. If the assets of interest to Disney are really worth nearly 80 percent of that, it serves to underscore how heavily discounted Fox stock is at present as compared with the value of its parts.  Disney boss Bob Iger would probably pay largely in stock. So could another mooted rival, Comcast, where Chief Executive Brian Roberts’ clan holds sway through super-voting shares. Getting tangled up in another family-controlled firm, though, might be less appealing to the Murdochs, who hold nearly 40 percent of the voting rights at Fox. Comcast’s cable business also adds antitrust risks that Disney doesn’t have.  The most intriguing aspect of matching Mickey Mouse with Fox relates to succession planning. Disney is searching for a replacement for Iger, who is due to retire in 2019. Meanwhile, the triumvirate at Fox – Rupert and one son, Lachlan, as co-chairmen and James, the other son, as CEO – is potentially fraught. James could land a senior position at Disney, according to the Financial Times, perhaps giving him a chance at succeeding Iger.  Whether James Murdoch would ultimately achieve that is another question. But it would leave a slimmed-down Fox and sister company News Corp to his father and brother. At a time of industry upheaval fueled by Netflix and the like, the Murdochs could even end up ensconced at three media companies.",12062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-the-force-could-be-with-disney-fox-deal-idUSKBN1E031E

1450,DIS,Britain pushes back date for provisional findings on Sky-Fox deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s competition watchdog will give its initial verdict on Rupert Murdoch’s bid to buy Sky (SKYB.L) next month, later than expected, due to the vast number of responses it has received on the deal. Murdoch’s $15 billion bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own is being watched closely in the United States where Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is in the lead to acquire much of his Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) media empire, including Sky.  Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has been inundated with submissions from interested parties over the high profile takeover, said on Wednesday it would make its provisional findings public in January rather than the week of Dec. 18. “It is not unusual for us to update our timetables,” a spokeswoman said. “In this case, we have received a large body of evidence – including numerous face-to-face hearings and more than 12,000 submissions - so it is vital that we spend the time to reach an informed and considered provisional view.” The regulator is still due to give its final findings in March, 15 months after Murdoch’s Fox agreed in December 2016 to buy the European pay-TV group, reigniting a row over whether the media mogul has too much influence in Britain.  Murdoch failed in a 2011 attempt to buy Sky when a phone-hacking scandal at his News of the World forced him to drop a previous attempt.  Since then he has split his companies into two to separate the newspapers from the TV businesses. Fox said when it agreed the deal it did not foresee any regulatory difficulties but the government has taken a strong line against the takeover. The media minister, Karen Bradley, asked the regulator in September to examine whether Murdoch had a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards following concerns about the running of his U.S. Fox News network. Bradley also asked the regulator to scrutinize whether the deal would give him too much influence at the heart of the British media.  Fox anticipates that its deal to buy the remaining shares in Sky will be approved in the first half of 2018. Any deal for Fox would include the remaining stake in Sky, sources have told Reuters.

Sources told Reuters last week that Disney was in the lead to acquire the assets, which include Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, the Star network in India and stake in European pay-TV provider Sky PLC. The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, prefers a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney stock than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, one of the sources said.  Comcast, the biggest cable provider in the United States, said in a statement on Monday that its discussions with Fox had ended. “When a set of assets like Fox’s becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.” The assets in question would have expanded Comcast’s international footprint through ownership of Sky and Star. A source told Reuters in mid-November that Comcast had approached Fox about its interest, and talks were in early stages. Disney’s negotiations with Fox are continuing, and a deal could be reached as early as this month, sources close to the situation said on Monday. The persons asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Disney did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Fox representative declined to comment. Any potential deal will follow the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision last month to sue to block AT&T; Inc’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc.

1463,DIS,"Comcast drops bid for Fox assets, leaving Disney in pole position","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp said on Monday it had abandoned its bid for most of the assets of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, leaving Walt Disney Co as the sole suitor in pursuit of the $40 billion-plus deal. Sources told Reuters last week that Disney was in the lead to acquire the assets, which include Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, the Star network in India and stake in European pay-TV provider Sky PLC. The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, prefers a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney stock than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, one of the sources said.  Comcast, the biggest cable provider in the United States, said in a statement on Monday that its discussions with Fox had ended. “When a set of assets like Fox’s becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.” The assets in question would have expanded Comcast’s international footprint through ownership of Sky and Star. A source told Reuters in mid-November that Comcast had approached Fox about its interest, and talks were in early stages. Disney’s negotiations with Fox are continuing, and a deal could be reached as early as this month, sources close to the situation said on Monday. The persons asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Disney did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Fox representative declined to comment. Any potential deal will follow the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision last month to sue to block AT&T; Inc’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc. Comcast shares were up 1.5 percent in after-hours trading, while Disney shares were up 0.2 percent and Fox shares fell 1.3 percent.

1464,DIS,UPDATE 1-Disney deal set to value Fox at more than $75 billion -source,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) will value the latter at over $40 per share, or $75 billion, a person familiar with the matter said. The deal, which is set to be announced on Thursday, will end more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at age 21 into one of the world’s most important global news and film conglomerates. Under the terms of the all-stock deal, Fox assets that will be sold to Disney, including the Twentieth Century Fox movie and TV studio, cable networks and international operations will be valued at around $29 per share, the source said on Wednesday. Fox’s remaining assets, focused on news and sports, will be offered to existing Fox shareholders in a new company likely to be valued at more than $11 per share, according to the source, who asked not to be identified ahead of an official announcement.  Disney and Fox did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fox shares ended trading on Wednesday at $32.75, giving it a market capitalization of around $60 billion. The Wall Street Journal first reported the exact terms of the deal. The deal will mark a return by Murdoch to focus on the news business, his lifelong passion. Australian-born Murdoch inherited his father’s newspaper business in 1952 and transformed it over many years, acquiring premiere properties such as the Wall Street Journal, the London Times and the 20th Century Fox movie studio. Murdoch’s shift to selling assets rather than buying them  has come as a surprise to many who expected him to hand over the businesses to his sons, James and Lachlan. None of the Murdochs are expected to be given board seats at Disney, according to the sources.  Disney has been struggling to bolster its TV business as cancellation of cable subscriptions is pressuring its biggest network, sports channel ESPN.  The Fox deal brings marquee franchises inside the Mouse House, on top of Disney CEO Bob Iger’s previous purchases, including Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm.  Disney also will buy Fox’s stake in the Hulu video streaming service, giving it majority control of the competitor to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). Hulu also is partially owned by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). Under the deal, Disney will gain access to 46 million subscribers in three major markets, the United States, Western Europe and India, according to Barclays analysts.  It also diversifies Disney’s revenue as U.S. cable television subscribers decline. Fox’s Star business in India, for example, is projected to earn $1 billion before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 2020, Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch said at a Business Insider conference in November. It is not clear how the deal will be treated by U.S. antitrust regulators, given that it looks set to reduce competition among  movie studios. The U.S. Department of Justice recently sued to block AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), on the basis that it will raise prices for consumers and competitors.

1467,DIS,Breakingviews - Fox deal will test Disney’s chief Mouseketeer,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Disney’s chief Mouseketeer is about to face his biggest test. The $160 billion media conglomerate is close to striking a deal to acquire parts of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox empire, pegged at $60 billion by CNBC. Some are an odd fit and regulators may not like Disney expanding in sports and movies. Boss Bob Iger has his work cut out. If scale is coin of the realm in media then it is easy to see why Iger might be eager to bulk up with Twenty-First Century Fox’s TV shows and films. Fear is also a pervasive motivator. Streaming service Netflix’s success in gathering 100 million global subscribers coupled with its heavy spending on content - up to $8 billion next year - is driving rivals into big deals. Picking off parts of Fox will come with considerable risks. For starters, not all of Fox’s cable networks mesh with Disney’s fare. The Mouse House is known for keeping tight control of its family-friendly brand. Fox peddles edgier programs with such series as the blood-spattered “The Americans” and raunchy “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Disney’s cable outlet ESPN is one of the most popular networks in the United States, yet subscribers are declining. But adding Fox’s regional sports channels will expose Disney even more to the rising cost of media rights – in North America alone that is expected to increase nearly 6 percent to $20 billion, according to PwC – and the overall drop in ratings for some franchises like the NFL. As well as the content itself, there’s the question of whether Disney can manage the politics. U.S. watchdogs fresh from suing AT&T; to block its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, will be on notice. Together, Disney and Fox studios account for more than 30 percent of movie-ticket sales so far this year, according to Box Office Mojo. Much depends on Iger himself. The Disney chief executive is due to leave in July 2019, but may extend his contract again if this deal occurs to oversee a growing Magic Kingdom. Investors ought to hope he does. So far, Iger has been a savvy acquirer, snapping up Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm. Even then, carving up Fox will be in a different league.",12132017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-fox-deal-will-test-disneys-chief-mouseketeer-idUSKBN1E72WS

1469,DIS,"UPDATE 8-Disney buying Fox film, TV units for $52 billion in digital push","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has struck a deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) for $52.4 billion in stock, giving the world’s largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). The deal brings to a close more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world’s most important global news and film conglomerates. The new, slimmed down Fox will focus on TV news and sport.  Early indications are that the deal will not face strong resistance from antitrust regulators as AT&T; Corp’s (T.N) bid to acquire Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) has done. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has attacked the AT&T; deal, spoke to Murdoch on Thursday and congratulated him on the deal, according to the White House. Shares of Fox, which have surged more than 30 percent since talk of the deal surfaced in early November, closed up 6.5 percent. Disney shares rose 2.7 percent, spurred on by the company’s plan to buy up to $20 billion of its own shares to offset dilution from the all-stock deal. Disney will also assume about $13.7 billion of Fox debt in the deal. Fox stockholders will receive 0.2745 Disney shares for each share held and will end up owning about a quarter of Disney.  Under the deal, expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Disney acquires 21st Century Fox’s film and television studios, its cable entertainment networks and international TV businesses.  That brings marquee franchises like “Avatar” and “The Simpsons” inside the Mouse House, on top of Iger’s previous purchases, including Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm. The deal also includes 22 of Fox’s regional sports networks that have the rights to televise live games of U.S. professional baseball, basketball and hockey teams as well as popular college and high school games.   Disney’s global footprint expands with the acquisition of Fox’s international satellite assets, including Star TV network in India and a stake in European pay-TV provider Sky Plc (SKYB.L) and sports rights in several countries.  The new pipeline of shows and movies will help Disney battle technology companies siphoning audiences away from traditional TV networks. Amazon is on track to spend at least $4.5 billion on video this year, according to analyst estimates, while Netflix plans to spend $8 billion on content next year. That is closing the gap on Disney, which spent $13.5 billion on content, half of that on sports, in the latest fiscal year, according to analysts. “The deal illustrates the huge strategic challenge traditional media companies face and how they need to reinvent their business models to compete with digital, online competitors such as Netflix, Google and Amazon,” said Nick Jones, partner and head of technology at Cavendish Corporate Finance. “(It) helps Disney dramatically reduce its reliance on traditional television, a business that has declined over the last two decades.” Immediately before the acquisition, Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly listed company that it will spin off to its shareholders. “This will be a growth company, centered on live news and sports brands and the strength of the Fox network,” 21st Century Fox Executive Chairman Murdoch told investors. He said Fox was not retreating, rather “pivoting at a pivotal moment.” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, 66, will extend his tenure through the end of 2021 to oversee the integration of the Fox businesses. He has already postponed his retirement from Disney three times, saying in March he was committed to leaving the company in July 2019.  If Iger sees out his new term, that would rule out a presidential bid in 2020, which had been the subject of some speculation. “This acquisition reflects a changing media landscape, increasingly defined by transforming technology and evolving consumer expectations,” Iger told investors on a conference call.   He said new technology would be necessary to meet the demands of viewers who want to access content anytime. Fox’s regional sports networks and cable network puts Disney in a better position to sell more shows directly to more consumers, he added. Disney has been struggling to bolster its TV business as cancellation of cable subscriptions is pressuring its biggest network, sports channel ESPN.  The company plans to launch its own streaming service in 2019, a calculated gamble that it can generate more profit in the long run from its own subscription service rather than renting out movies to services like Netflix. It is not clear who will head the new Fox. Iger said current Fox CEO James Murdoch, Rupert’s younger son, will help with the transition and that the two will discuss whether he will have a longer-term role at Disney.  Through Fox’s stake in the Hulu video streaming service, Disney will assume majority control of one of Netflix’s main competitors. Hulu is also partially owned by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). A majority of antitrust experts contacted by Reuters said the deal would likely win approval from U.S. antitrust authorities, although the U.S. Department of Justice may require asset sales or conditions, they said.  Fox said it remained committed to buying the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own and expects to win regulatory approval from Britain and to close the deal by the end of June, 2018. Britain’s Takeover Panel said Disney had informed the watchdog that should it only buy 39 percent of the company - if Murdoch fails to buy the rest of Sky - it did not think it should be forced to make a full bid for the company. The statement prompted Sky’s stock to fall by 1 percent. In Britain, any investor acquiring 30 percent of a listed company is automatically forced to make a bid for the rest of the stock. The Takeover Panel said it would seek the opinions of Sky’s independent directors before making a decision.

1470,DIS,Fitch Places Twenty-First Century Fox on Watch Negative following Disney Acquisition Announcement,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the 'BBB+' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) assigned to Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOX), and its wholly owned subsidiary 21st Century Fox America, Inc. on Rating Watch Negative following the announcement that The Walt Disney Company (Disney) will acquire certain of FOX's assets in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $69 billion. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. Approximately $20 billion of debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2017 is affected by Fitch's action. Fitch's actions are driven by the lack of clarity regarding how FOX's existing debt will be treated and where it will ultimately reside in Disney's capital structure. Prior to the acquisition, FOX will separate its news and broadcast businesses and certain sports networks and equity interests into a newly listed company to be spun off to existing shareholders (FOX SpinCo). Disney will then acquire FOX's remaining assets, including $6.3 billion of cash, television and film studios, regional sports networks, general entertainment cable networks, international assets including cable networks and FOX's 39% equity stake in Sky plc (Sky) as well as FOX's equity stake in Hulu, along with the full $20billion of outstanding FOX debt (collectively, FOX RemainCo). If The Walt Disney Company does not elect to guarantee or become a direct obligor of the FOX RemainCo debt, Fitch-calculated total leverage as of Sept. 30, 2017 for FOX RemainCo would increase to 4.3x from 2.7x based on estimated EBITDA of approximately $4.7 billion for FY2018 as provided by Disney (excluding synergies). Under this scenario, FOX RemainCo's total leverage would be well outside the range for Fitch's 'BBB+' category. While Fitch would assume FOX RemainCo would benefit from strong strategic and operational ties it acknowledges the weak legal ties. As such, Fitch's Parent Subsidiary Linkage criteria allows for a subsidiary's IDR to be notched below the parent, typically within a range of three notches. FOX expects to continue efforts to close its previously announced $15 billion, all-cash transaction for the remaining 61% equity stake of Sky it does not own. The transaction continues to be subject to receipt of shareholder and regulatory approval and FOX expects it to close by June 30, 2018. If both FOX's acquisition of Sky and Disney's acquisition of FOX RemainCo closes, Fitch lacks clarity as to where the Sky transaction debt will ultimately reside in Disney's capital structure. Fitch estimates Sky acquisition debt will approximate $22 billion in aggregate including $12.1 billion of existing Sky debt and $10 billion of acquisition-related debt. If FOX RemainCo only assumes Sky's existing debt, Fitch estimates total leverage would decrease to 4.0x, based on Fitch's FY2018 estimate for Sky EBITDA of $2.9 billion. However, if FOX RemainCo were to assume the full amount, Fitch estimates total leverage would increase to 5.6x. Fitch notes that in any case it expects FOX RemainCo leverage to decline due to its expectation that Disney will refinance FOX RemainCo debt over time with debt issuance at the parent, along with continued EBITDA growth. Following the acquisition, FOX RemainCo will include the Twentieth Century Fox film and television studios, FX Networks, Fox Sports Regional Networks, Fox Networks Group International, Star India, and equity interests in National Geographic Partners, Hulu, Sky, Tata Sky and Endemol Shine Group. FOX SpinCo will comprise Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Sports, Fox Television Stations Group, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes and Big Ten Network along with its equity investment in Roku and its Los Angeles studio lot. The spin-off transaction will be taxable to FOX RemainCo, but not to its shareholders. To fund this liability, FOX SpinCo will pay an $8.5 billion cash dividend to FOX RemainCo prior to the spin, which Fitch expects will be funded with debt issuance. If FOX RemainCo's final tax liability is less than $8.5 billion, up to $2 billion of the reduced amountwill be returned to FOX SpinCo. As result of the step-up in FOX SpinCo's tax basis matching the amount of the spin-off's final corporate tax, FOX SpinCo will generate 15 years of cash tax savings. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Business Profile:  FOX's businesses consist of a leading portfolio of cable networks, television and movie studios, a national television network, and local television broadcast assets each of which have the scale characteristics to operate at high margins. Fitch believes these businesses provide solid growth prospects and the ability to generate meaningful FCF levels, and balanced against the risks inherent in the company's operating profile, place the company solidly within Fitch's parameters for the 'BBB+' rating. Sky Acquisition: On Dec. 15, 2016, FOX announced it was acquiring the 60.9% of Sky plc it does not own for $14.8 billion, funded with cash on hand and approximately $10 billion of debt. On Sept. 20, 2017, the UK Competition and Markets Authority referred the deal for a six-month review on public interest grounds and recently delayed releasing its preliminary findings until mid-January 2018. Because the deal will not close by Dec. 31, 2017, FOX will be required to pay a $135 million special dividend due to Sky's independent shareholders as required under the acquisition's terms. Investments Upside: FOX's equity investments include the 39.1% interest in Sky, 50% interest in Endemol Shine Group, a 30% interest in Hulu, LLC and several smaller investments in other media platforms. Fitch believes these investments allow FOX to be at the forefront of providing content to over-the-top (OTT) and emerging distribution platforms and capturing audiences in a fragmented television viewing ecosystem. While the investments do not provide meaningful contributions to earnings, they could be a source of liquidity. Consistent Financial Policy: If the Disney transaction does not occur and FOX is successful in acquiring the remainder of Sky, Fitch expects the company will use FCF generation along with its cash balances to repay debt. Management was very clear that it remains committed to its investment-grade ratings and expects to rapidly deleverage through EBITDA growth and FCF generation. Fitch expects FOX will curtail share repurchases and use its FCF generation and cash balances to return leverage to within the company's leverage target of 2.5x-3.0x within 24 months of closing. Credible Strategy to Address Threats: Fitch continues to believe FOX is well positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience fragmentation. The ratings incorporate earnings volatility from the Filmed Entertainment segment, given the hit-driven nature of the movie industry. Rating Concerns: Exposure to cyclical advertising revenues within local television and Fox Network ad sales, as well as the company's capacity to adapt to ever-changing media consumption patterns and technology platforms, highlight rating concerns. Fitch notes advertising revenues remained approximately 28% of revenues as of the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2017. DERIVATION SUMMARY The ratings reflect the company's strong collection of cable and regional sports networks, leading television and film studios, national television network, robust sports programming rights and local television broadcast. FOX is less reliant on advertising relative to its peers; ad revenues contributed 28% to revenues as of LTM ended Sept. 30, 2017. Additionally, if the company is successful in acquiring the remainder of Sky's ownership, the added product line and geographic diversification further reduce FOX's reliance on the volatile ad market. The company's businesses provide the ability to generate meaningful levels of FCF, leading to sustained investment in growth initiatives. Through this, FOX remains well positioned to address an increasingly fragmented market with the emergence of alternative distribution platforms. The ratings also incorporate expected earnings volatility generated by the company's Filmed Entertainment segment, given the general hit-driven nature of the movie industry. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions (for FOX stand-alone) within the agency's rating case for the issuer include: --Revenue growth within the company's cable network programming business reflects the company's ability to secure affiliate fee rate increases. Fitch anticipates low-double-digit affiliate fee growth. --The company's investment in original programming and acquisition of sports rights supports affiliate fee growth. --From a margin perspective, the base case reflects the company's investment in original programming and costs associated with acquired programming. The ability to grow higher affiliate fee revenues at a similar pace to programming costs contributes to stable margins at the cable network programming segment. --Fitch assumes typical volatility within the Filmed Entertainment business. The Television segment benefits from a stable economy and growing retransmission consent revenues while incorporating a typical political advertising revenue cycle. Fitch assumes a slightly weaker television advertising environment as digital media continues to take share. Fitch expects political advertising to contribute to positive growth during 2018. --The Sky acquisition closes in the first half of 2019 under existing terms and conditions. --FOX uses its FCF and cash on hand to repay debt, returning leverage to below 3x during 2020. --Fitch assumes FOX curtails its share buyback activity to free up more cash for debt repayment. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Actions --Fitch does not anticipate a rating upgrade given the acquisition discussions with Disney and the uncertain outcome surrounding the treatment of existing debt. --Fitch also does not anticipate a rating upgrade if the Disney discussions are unsuccessful given FOX's focus on acquiring the 60.9% of Sky it does not own. --Positive rating action would likely coincide with FOX adopting a more conservative financial policy, highlighted by a gross leverage target of 2x or lower. Meanwhile, FOX will need to demonstrate that its operating profile can sustain itself amid ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption patterns and evolving technology platforms. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Actions --Negative rating actions would be considered if Fitch determines that the organizational structure following Disney's acquisition of FOX RemainCo is disadvantageous to legacy FOX bondholders. Fitch would also need to consider Disney's financial policy regarding refinancing FOX RemainCo debt going forward. --Negative rating actions would be considered if FOX does not reduce total leverage to below 3x within 18-24 months after the closing of the Sky acquisition. --A material change in the terms of the acquisition prior to closing as a result of regulatory or shareholder requirements. --A material shift in financial policy including, but not limited to, the company adopting a more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition activity that drives leverage beyond 3x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan while exhausting excess cash balances. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes that FOX's liquidity position and financial flexibility are strong for the current rating given the strength of its businesses and expected FCF generation. The company's liquidity position is supported by an existing cash balance totaling $6.9 billion as of Sept. 30, 2017 (approximately $1 billion held by foreign subsidiaries as of Sept. 30, 2017), full borrowing capacity on its $1.4 billion revolver, which expires May 2020, and access to various film co-financing alternatives. The company generated approximately $2.2 billion of Fitch-defined FCF for the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2017. FCF generation remains strong even as the company continues to invest in channel launches, original content and higher programming costs (including sports programming) across its portfolio of cable and television networks. Fitch expects these investments will remain among the company's key priorities over the rating horizon. If FOX completes the Sky acquisition, Fitch expects FOX will use its FCF generation and cash balances to further invest in its core businesses and growth initiatives while curtailing share repurchases until leverage is below 3x.

1472,DIS,"UPDATE 1-Trump supports deal for Disney to acquire Fox film, TV units -White House","(Adds background) WASHINGTON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump supports the deal that Walt Disney Co has struck to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, the White House said on Thursday. “I know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal and thinks that, to use one of the president’s favorite words, that this could be a great thing for jobs and certainly looks forward to and hoping to see a lot more of those,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. The deal is likely to face an antitrust review by the Department of Justice, which is run by a Trump appointee. Trump often praises Fox News, the conservative cable news channel that has given him favorable coverage and is also owned by Murdoch but not included in the sale. Trump has been less enthusiastic about mergers of companies that own news outlets of which he has been critical. The president objected to the proposed AT&T; Inc and Time Warner Inc merger, which is currently being litigated after the Justice Department sued to block the deal. Time Warner owns cable news network CNN, which Trump frequently says reports “fake news.” Trump was also scathing of Amazon.com Inc while the government was reviewing its acquisition of Whole Foods, a deal that was ultimately approved. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, which Trump has criticized.

1475,DIS,"Breakingviews - Disney deal widens Murdoch legacy, erases discount","NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Walt Disney is expanding its Magic Kingdom to include the Murdoch empire. It is paying $52.4 billion in stock to own a slimmed-down Twenty-First Century Fox, including the movie studio and a 39 percent stake in Sky. It’s a historic deal for media mogul Rupert Murdoch – and it should erase the discount afflicting his long-suffering shareholders. It is, as Murdoch put it, a “momentous” moment for the media conglomerate he spent decades building. He is more often the aggressor than the target, latterly alongside his sons, Lachlan and James. Controlling some 40 percent of Fox voting shares has allowed him to prowl for deals without much interference. However, that’s also why Fox has traded at a discount to its peers – roughly 30 percent, give or take, by various calculations over the years. Other assets that will go with Fox to the $160 billion Disney include regional sports networks, cable channel FX and Star India. The rest of the Murdoch vehicle’s properties, including Fox News, will be spun off into a new company before the sale to Disney is consummated. The numbers are complicated, but including the Sky stake and a 30 percent share of Hulu, Breakingviews calculates the assets going to Disney could be worth about $58 billion in enterprise value. It’s paying $66.1 billion including assumed debt, more than the entire Fox was worth, including net debt, in early November before deal talks were first reported. The new Fox spinoff, using similar calculations which draw on analysis by MoffetNathanson and Bernstein, should be worth around $31 billion in enterprise value – assuming Murdoch’s continuing role doesn’t perpetuate a discount there. Add the two and subtract total net debt of around $15 billion and the $8.5 billion Disney suggests will go out in taxes, and today’s Fox shareholders may end up with Disney and “New Fox” stock worth an estimated $74 billion. At some $40 a share, that would be a 60 percent uplift from the value of Fox stock early last month. Even with less generous assumptions, the likely outcome easily wipes out the Murdoch discount. Disney CEO Bob Iger, meanwhile, has found a way to extend his tenure again. He’ll now stay until 2021. Among other things, he is promising $2 billion of cost savings. Before that, the deal may face antitrust questions. And by the time he does quit, it’s possible James Murdoch will be a candidate to succeed him. Along with “New Fox” and the newspaper-heavy News Corp, that would be a new kind of Murdoch legacy.",12142017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-disney-deal-widens-murdoch-legacy-erases-discount-idUSKBN1E82JP

1482,DIS,"Disney buying Fox film, TV units for $52 billion in digital push","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has struck a deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) for $52.4 billion in stock, giving the world’s largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). The deal brings to a close more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world’s most important global news and film conglomerates. The new, slimmed down Fox will focus on TV news and sport.  Early indications are that the deal will not face strong resistance from antitrust regulators as AT&T; Corp’s (T.N) bid to acquire Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) has done. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has attacked the AT&T; deal, spoke to Murdoch on Thursday and congratulated him on the deal, according to the White House. Shares of Fox, which have surged more than 30 percent since talk of the deal surfaced in early November, closed up 6.5 percent. Disney shares rose 2.7 percent, spurred on by the company’s plan to buy up to $20 billion of its own shares to offset dilution from the all-stock deal. Disney will also assume about $13.7 billion of Fox debt in the deal. Fox stockholders will receive 0.2745 Disney shares for each share held and will end up owning about a quarter of Disney.  Under the deal, expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Disney acquires 21st Century Fox’s film and television studios, its cable entertainment networks and international TV businesses.  That brings marquee franchises like “Avatar” and “The Simpsons” inside the Mouse House, on top of Iger’s previous purchases, including Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm. The deal also includes 22 of Fox’s regional sports networks that have the rights to televise live games of U.S. professional baseball, basketball and hockey teams as well as popular college and high school games.   Disney’s global footprint expands with the acquisition of Fox’s international satellite assets, including Star TV network in India and a stake in European pay-TV provider Sky Plc (SKYB.L) and sports rights in several countries.  The new pipeline of shows and movies will help Disney battle technology companies siphoning audiences away from traditional TV networks. Amazon is on track to spend at least $4.5 billion on video this year, according to analyst estimates, while Netflix plans to spend $8 billion on content next year. That is closing the gap on Disney, which spent $13.5 billion on content, half of that on sports, in the latest fiscal year, according to analysts. “The deal illustrates the huge strategic challenge traditional media companies face and how they need to reinvent their business models to compete with digital, online competitors such as Netflix, Google and Amazon,” said Nick Jones, partner and head of technology at Cavendish Corporate Finance. “(It) helps Disney dramatically reduce its reliance on traditional television, a business that has declined over the last two decades.” Immediately before the acquisition, Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly listed company that it will spin off to its shareholders. “This will be a growth company, centered on live news and sports brands and the strength of the Fox network,” 21st Century Fox Executive Chairman Murdoch told investors. He said Fox was not retreating, rather “pivoting at a pivotal moment.” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, 66, will extend his tenure through the end of 2021 to oversee the integration of the Fox businesses. He has already postponed his retirement from Disney three times, saying in March he was committed to leaving the company in July 2019.  If Iger sees out his new term, that would rule out a presidential bid in 2020, which had been the subject of some speculation. “This acquisition reflects a changing media landscape, increasingly defined by transforming technology and evolving consumer expectations,” Iger told investors on a conference call.   He said new technology would be necessary to meet the demands of viewers who want to access content anytime. Fox’s regional sports networks and cable network puts Disney in a better position to sell more shows directly to more consumers, he added. Disney has been struggling to bolster its TV business as cancellation of cable subscriptions is pressuring its biggest network, sports channel ESPN.  The company plans to launch its own streaming service in 2019, a calculated gamble that it can generate more profit in the long run from its own subscription service rather than renting out movies to services like Netflix. It is not clear who will head the new Fox. Iger said current Fox CEO James Murdoch, Rupert’s younger son, will help with the transition and that the two will discuss whether he will have a longer-term role at Disney.  Through Fox’s stake in the Hulu video streaming service, Disney will assume majority control of one of Netflix’s main competitors. Hulu is also partially owned by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). A majority of antitrust experts contacted by Reuters said the deal would likely win approval from U.S. antitrust authorities, although the U.S. Department of Justice may require asset sales or conditions, they said.  Fox said it remained committed to buying the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own and expects to win regulatory approval from Britain and to close the deal by the end of June, 2018. Britain’s Takeover Panel said Disney had informed the watchdog that should it only buy 39 percent of the company - if Murdoch fails to buy the rest of Sky - it did not think it should be forced to make a full bid for the company. The statement prompted Sky’s stock to fall by 1 percent. In Britain, any investor acquiring 30 percent of a listed company is automatically forced to make a bid for the rest of the stock. The Takeover Panel said it would seek the opinions of Sky’s independent directors before making a decision.

1483,DIS,Family-friendly Disney to bring edgier Fox fare to streaming video,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is poised to add foul-mouthed superhero Deadpool and gory TV series “American Horror Story” to its portfolio, a novel move for the king of family-friendly entertainment into the adult-oriented programming consumers are devouring on streaming video. Disney’s deal to buy most of the film and TV businesses of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) will aid the efforts of Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger to transform the company from a traditional media operation dependent on pay TV distributors to one that streams shows and movies directly to consumers online.  With the Fox deal, “they have content for everyone,” Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said. “They have family-friendly content, but that does not need to be the only thing they do, because there is a broader audience looking for a broad type of content.” In acquiring the Fox assets, Disney will also gain majority control of Hulu, a live TV and on-demand video provider that competes with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), the dominant streaming service.  Disney plans to make Hulu the home for programming aimed at adults such as FX series, keeping it separate from a Disney-branded streaming service for families planned for 2019, Iger told reporters on a conference call.  “It’s an opportunity for us to take some of these brands that don’t necessarily share all of the Disney brand attributes and use them to grow Hulu,” Iger said. FX airs shows such as the bloody “American Horror Story” and the dark and often graphically violent drama “Fargo,” a type of programming more akin to series found on Netflix or Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) HBO.  Iger said Disney has shown itself able in the past to successfully integrate new kinds of programming into its mission. Disney previously acquired Pixar Animation Studios, superhero studio Marvel Entertainment and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm and has given them a large degree of autonomy. That experience “suggests that we will be able to integrate these brands into the company in a manner that does not in any way create negatives for us,” Iger said. In March 2016, after Fox’s “Deadpool” movie became a huge hit, Iger was asked at the company’s annual shareholder meeting if Disney would consider making similar R-rated films featuring its Marvel superheroes. Iger said Disney did not plan to. On Thursday, Iger pulled back from that position, saying that characters like Deadpool might provide a model for an edgier kind of Marvel movie. “We think there might be an opportunity for a Marvel R brand for something like Deadpool,” he said, “as long as we let the audience know what’s coming.” ",12152017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-walt-disney-culture/family-friendly-disney-to-bring-edgier-fox-fare-to-streaming-video-idUSKBN1E83BW

1487,DIS,Factbox: Disney's global footprint post-Fox deal,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has struck a deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), seeking even greater scale as it battles digital rivals Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Following is an outline of the resources and assets the world’s biggest entertainment company, with a current market value of about $166 billion, will hold if the deal is completed. - Under the deal, Disney is acquiring Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, India’s main network Star and a stake in European pay-TV provider Sky Plc (SKYB.L).   - Taken together, Fox and Disney generated a total of $16.3 billion in advertising revenue in the 2017 financial year.  - The two companies’ studio businesses generated $16.6 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2017. - Disney’s ESPN sports channels have about 88 million U.S. subscribers and 146 million internationally.  - Data from film industry website Box Office Mojo gives Fox and Disney together about 30 percent of an estimated $10 billion in box office taken by U.S. cinemas so far this year, which would make the combined company the single largest player, ahead of Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) Warner Bros with 20 percent. - British bank Barclays said Hulu, Sky, and India’s Tata Sky together give Disney 46 million streaming or cable subscriptions in the United States, Western Europe and India, compared to Netflix’s global figure of 109 million customers.  - Barclays analysts also calculated that the combined movie and TV libraries of Fox Studio and Disney’s Buena Vista studios, which includes Pixar Animations and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm, has more titles than Netflix. - Disney plans to pull its first-run movies from Netflix starting in 2019. If it did the same with Fox programming, Netflix would lose “The Simpsons,” the “Star Wars” franchise and all Marvel superhero films.  - The deal would give Disney access to franchises and characters including “X-Men,” “Wolverine,” “Deadpool” and “Fantastic Four” and reunite them with the rest of the Marvel comic universe under one roof. - Disney’s library of kids’ content dwarfs Netflix’s, with over 700 titles compared to around 400, according to Barclays.  - Disney will be able to distribute its programming on Star India, operator of 69 channels in eight languages in the world’s fastest-growing subscription TV market, as well as Star’s popular Hotstar streaming service.

1488,DIS,"Trump supports deal for Disney to acquire Fox film, TV units: White House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump supports the deal that Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has struck to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), the White House said on Thursday. “I know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal and thinks that, to use one of the president’s favorite words, that this could be a great thing for jobs and certainly looks forward to and hoping to see a lot more of those,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. The deal is likely to face an antitrust review by the Department of Justice, which is run by a Trump appointee.      Trump often praises Fox News, the conservative cable news channel that has given him favorable coverage and is also owned by Murdoch but not included in the sale. Trump has been less enthusiastic about mergers of companies that own news outlets of which he has been critical. The president objected to the proposed AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) merger, which is currently being litigated after the Justice Department sued to block the deal. Time Warner owns cable news network CNN, which Trump frequently says reports “fake news.”  Trump was also scathing of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) while the government was reviewing its acquisition of Whole Foods, a deal that was ultimately approved.

""I have decided that the most important thing I can do right now is to take care of my problem.""

He had been its president from 1998 to 2011 and executive chairman until May 2014. An ESPN spokeswoman declined to comment on who may be considered as Skipper’s successor. Skipper’s departure comes within a few days after Disney struck a deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) for $52.4 billion. Skipper, who became ESPN president in 2012, has led the network to a series of long-term distribution agreements with major rights holders, including the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball. But ESPN has also struggled with subscriber losses and ratings declines. Last month, it said it would lay off about 150 employees.  Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, who extended his stay at the company through 2021 to oversee integration of Fox’s businesses, lauded Skipper’s candor and backed his decision.

1492,DIS,Odey adds to Sky disquiet following Disney's deal with Fox,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey has argued that Sky (SKYB.L) should fetch a higher price following Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) $52 billion deal with Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA.O), adding to shareholder disquiet about the fate of the European broadcaster. Rupert Murdoch’s Fox agreed last December to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for 10.75 pounds-a-share but the deal has been delayed by a regulatory review.  Fox’s existing 39 percent stake in Sky is now part of a wider package of film, television and international assets being sold to Disney, a deal that Odey believes demonstrates that Sky is being sold too cheaply. If approved by regulators, Fox’s takeover of Sky is expected to close by the end of next June, before the completion of the Disney acquisition. That means Mickey Mouse-owner Disney would acquire all of the UK company following its deal with Fox.  “Basically, here is Fox being bought-out on 12 times cashflow,” Odey, whose hedge fund is a 0.9 percent investor Sky company, told Reuters. “If we [Sky shareholders] were being sold on 12 times cashflow we’d be at 12.30 pounds.” Sky shares were up 0.6 percent at 10.24 pounds on Monday. A spokesman for Sky declined to comment. Fox and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Disney’s deal with Fox, announced on Dec. 14, adds another complication to the 11.7 billion-pound ($15.6 billion) Sky deal, which has already faced fierce criticism from British politicians and is being investigated by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority.  Odey, who had previously criticized the planned Fox deal, joins fellow small shareholder Polygon in questioning the takeover of the FTSE 100 company in the wake of the Disney deal. The UK’s Takeover Panel said last week that it had been told by Disney that the U.S. giant did not believe it should be forced to make an offer for Sky if Fox is blocked from buying out the remaining 61 percent by the regulator. Disney would hold a 39 percent stake in Sky if the Fox acquisition of the broadcaster fails.  Rule 9.1 of the Takeover Panel’s code stipulates that an investor buying 30 percent or more of a listed company must automatically make an offer for the rest of the shares, although exemptions can be agreed by the watchdog.  The Panel’s executive said it was seeking the views of Sky’s independent directors before making a decision on Disney. “In the case of Disney/Fox, if Disney had agreed to buy the 39 percent Sky stake directly from Fox, minority shareholders in Sky would have been entitled to an increase in the 10.75 pounds-per-share price already being offered by Fox to the price being offered by Disney,” Polygon said.  Given that Disney is paying about 12 times 2017 and 2018 enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the Fox businesses, the hedge fund said that the price for Sky should be more than 13 pound-a-share. “But the Fox and the Mouse have been more clever than that,” Polygon said.  “They have wrapped the Sky stake with a number of other attractive Fox assets and tied it up with a bow and ribbon and told the Takeover Panel that Rule 9.1 does not apply – and therefore that no premium is due to Sky’s minority shareholders.” ",12182017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-fox-odey/odey-adds-to-sky-disquiet-following-disneys-deal-with-fox-idUSKBN1EC1QY

1494,DIS,Fitch Maintains Sky on Rating Watch Positive,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) MOSCOW/LONDON, December 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings is maintaining Sky plc's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings of  'BBB-' remain on Rating Watch Positive (RWP) following the announcement that The Walt Disney Company (Disney; A/Stable) will acquire 21st Century Fox, Inc. (FOX; BBB+/RWN). Fitch placed Sky's ratings on RWP on 16 December 2016 following the announcement of FOX's intention to acquire full control of the UK-based direct-to-home broadcaster. Both transactions are subject to regulatory approval. Assuming either both or only FOX/Sky transactions go ahead Fitch will view Sky's ratings in the context of the broadcaster's ownership by a stronger ultimate parent whether it is Disney or FOX. We expect strong strategic and operational links with Sky's higher-rated parent as per Fitch parent-subsidiary (PSL) methodology. However, legal ties in terms of direct support for subsidiary debt are less certain as it is not yet clear how FOX or Disney intend to manage the capital structure of the group. Subject to successful transactions and more clarity on how a parent plans to fund its subsidiary in the medium term, the ratings of Sky might be notched higher from its standalone profile for parental support. Fitch expects to resolve the RWP once the two transactions are finalised. If the transactions do not proceed, Fitch presently expects to affirm Sky's ratings at 'BBB-' given the company's underlying business and financial risk profile. Fitch views Sky as uniquely positioned as the UK's leading pay-TV platform, having established the UK as the most developed pay-TV market in Europe. Sky enjoys a strong business risk profile that is complemented by its wider telecoms capabilities, including a strong broadband position and nascent mobile business. Constraining factors are high leverage, a competitive UK communications market, near-term cash flow pressures and exposure to content rights inflation. KEY RATING DRIVERS Disney to Acquire FOX.  Fitch has placed the 'BBB+' IDR of FOX on Rating Watch Negative following the announcement that Disney will acquire certain of FOX's assets in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately USD69 billion. Fitch's actions are driven by the lack of clarity regarding how FOX's existing debt will be treated and where it will ultimately reside in Disney's capital structure. While Fitch would assume FOX would benefit from strong strategic and operational ties it acknowledges the weak legal ties between FOX and Disney. As such, Fitch's Parent Subsidiary Linkage criteria allows for a subsidiary's IDR to be notched below the parent, typically within a range of three notches. FOX expects to continue efforts to close its previously announced USD15 billion, all-cash transaction for the remaining 61% equity stake of Sky it does not own. A positive rating action for Sky is possible if either both or only FOX/Sky transaction succeed, reflecting potentially positive implications of ownership by a stronger ultimate parent. If the FOX/Sky deal are cancelled Sky's ratings should be affirmed at 'BBB-' providing the company's standalone operating and financial profile do not change materially. Sustained Operating Performance: Sky's businesses continue to perform well. Despite the maturity and competitiveness of its core TV/communications markets, the UK and Ireland delivered 5% constant-currency growth in 1Q FY18 (financial year end June), levels that comfortably outpace incumbent telecom revenue. Growth in these markets is slowing although Sky reports continued success in adding subscribers and maintaining other operating metrics. The pace of additions is nonetheless slowing and churn rates have ticked up, albeit remaining at best-in-class levels. The less-developed continental European businesses are growing at a healthy pace. Leverage Stabilising but High: Sky's leverage is high for the company's standalone rating. Sky ended FY17 with funds from operations (FFO) lease-adjusted net leverage of 3.1x compared with our downgrade threshold of 3.2x. Our rating case envisages a metric of 3.3x in FY18, breaching the downgrade guideline. The metric will continue to be affected by near-term cash flow and margin pressures resulting from content rights inflation that is compounded historically by the non-cash movements in debt driven by sterling's depreciation following the EU referendum. Deleveraging beyond 2018 is forecasted given an expected recovery in operational cash flows although foreign-exchange risk remains. Competitive UK Communications Market: Fitch views the UK, by far Sky's largest individual market, a particularly competitive market. In fixed line and TV both the incumbent BT Group plc (BBB+/Stable) and cable operator Virgin Media Inc. (BB-/Stable) have developed strong product offerings and market positions. BT's entrance to pay-TV in 2012, with an emphasis on exclusive sports content, has changed the nature of the sector, while a four-player network-based mobile market makes competition intense and convergence potentially more important to the UK consumer. Against this backdrop, Sky has established a strong commercial proposition with strengths across all main service platforms. DERIVATION SUMMARY Sky's broader peer group includes telcos such as BT Group plc, Royal KPN N.V. (BBB/Stable) and TDC A/S (BBB-/Stable), sub-investment grade cable operators such as Virgin Media Inc. and Telenet Group Holding N.V (BB-/Stable), and media conglomerate Vivendi SA (BBB/Stable). Sky's business model is nonetheless quite idiosyncratic given the company's position as the founder of pay-TV in the UK, a premium content-led business model and attendant exposure to content rights inflation. We regard Sky as strongly positioned in the UK pay-TV market and that management understands the need to provide a complete communications offering in this market given its expansion into telecoms services. Its revenue growth remains stronger than most of the telcos', but margins face pressure from content rights inflation and its business model and cash flow potentially face greater challenges than the telcos and cable operators. This drives a standalone rating profile at the lower end of the investment-grade range. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's Key Assumptions within Our Rating Case for the Issuer include: - Low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth; about 4.5% in 2018, falling to about 3.5% through 2021; - Adjusted EBITDA margin of 16%-17% in 2018-2021, with sports content rights suppressing margins in FY18 (Bundesliga costs) and FY20 (English Premier League costs); - Margins strengthening above 17% in FY21 given cost savings and scale economies in Germany and Italy; - Group capex to remain at about 7% of sales; and - Approximate GBP400 million dividend payment in FY18 (including a special dividend of GBP171 million), increasing to in excess of GBP600 million beyond. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating sensitivities for Sky's ratings on a standalone basis are as follows: Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Expectations of FFO net leverage remaining consistently below 2.7x (including transponder costs). -Free cash flow (FCF) margin consistently in high single digits (FY17: 2.7%). -Evidence of the resilience of the company's operating environment and core pay-TV business. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Expectations of FFO net leverage remaining consistently above 3.2x (including transponder costs). -Expectations of FCF margin remaining consistently below 4%. -Material deterioration in Sky's operating environment and key performance indicators; including the impact of content rights inflation, material weakening in reported churn, average revenue per user or evidence that over-the-top TV is becoming a more significant threat to its traditional pay-TV business. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: At end-June 2017, Sky reported cash and cash equivalent of GBP2.5 billion and access to an undrawn GBP1 billion revolving credit facility due 2021. Sky has sufficient cash to cover the next three years' worth of debt maturities with their revolving credit facility extending this period further.

1496,DIS,ESPN President Skipper resigns to deal with substance addiction,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) John Skipper resigned on Monday as president of ESPN, the company’s most important network, due to a problem with addiction.  ""I have struggled for many years with a substance addiction,"" Skipper, who was also Disney Media Networks co-chairman, said in a statement. ""I have decided that the most important thing I can do right now is to take care of my problem."" (es.pn/2kgmnCb) George Bodenheimer will be the sports network’s acting chairman for the next 90 days, ESPN said in a statement. He had been its president from 1998 to 2011 and executive chairman until May 2014. An ESPN spokeswoman declined to comment on who may be considered as Skipper’s successor. Skipper’s departure comes within a few days after Disney struck a deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) for $52.4 billion. Skipper, who became ESPN president in 2012, has led the network to a series of long-term distribution agreements with major rights holders, including the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball. But ESPN has also struggled with subscriber losses and ratings declines. Last month, it said it would lay off about 150 employees.  Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, who extended his stay at the company through 2021 to oversee integration of Fox’s businesses, lauded Skipper’s candor and backed his decision.     Disney shares were down 0.2 percent at $111.09 on Monday afternoon.

1497,DIS,Power restored at California's Disneyland after brief outage,"(Reuters) - Disneyland, the Walt Disney Co theme park in Southern California, was fully operating following a power outage that lasted for several hours on Wednesday, disrupting several popular rides during one of the busiest weeks of the year. Disneyland spokeswoman Suzi Brown said power has been restored to all areas of the theme park. In a Twitter posting, Disneyland said the park was fully open. During the power outage, Disneyland had said that it was accepting visitors only for re-entry. An issue with a transformer that supplies power to the Toontown and Fantasyland areas in the park caused the outage. The theme park, which calls itself “The Happiest Place on Earth,” draws tens of thousands of visitors each day.  Popular rides including “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Finding Nemo” were all affected, said Los Angeles resident Ashoka Thiagarajan, who was visiting with his wife and two children. “It’s a huge disappointment. This is my mom’s Christmas present to all of us. This has been in the making since August,” said Thiagarajan, who was stuck inside “Pirates of the Caribbean” for some 20 minutes. Many visitors took to Twitter to complain and ask for refunds. “How’s Disneyland gonna have a power outage the day we paid $124 for peak day tickets?” one visitor tweeted. The Disney California Adventure theme park was unaffected by the outage, the park said in a tweet.

1498,DIS,CEOs go M&A; hunting as booming markets unleash dealmaking spirits,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions had another strong year in 2017, reaching their third highest annual level since the 2008 financial crisis, as CEOs were emboldened by buoyant markets to pursue transformative deals, even when their targets resisted. Companies negotiated large deals this year even before they had certainty that U.S. tax reforms advocated by President Donald Trump’s Republican party would become law, as economic growth around the world, including in Europe, accelerated. Setting 2017 apart was the willingness of potential acquirers to approach their targets unsolicited. In some instances, as with chipmaker Broadcom Ltd’s $103 billion cash-and-stock bid to take over peer Qualcomm Inc, the target companies refused to engage in talks. “In cases where companies have been sold, close to 80 percent of them were initiated by the buyer approaching the seller as opposed to companies who decided to sell,” said Michael Carr, global co-head of mergers & acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “Some of this is driven by buyers who believe they will not face competition, which encourages them to aggressively pressure their targets confidentially with the implied threat that they will go public,” Carr added. Unsolicited takeover approaches helped push global M&A; to $3.54 trillion in 2017, roughly in line with last year’s $3.59 trillion, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data. The peak M&A; year since 2008 was 2015, when M&A; totaled $4.22 trillion. The dealmaking environment has been favorable in the last three years due to the availability of cheap debt financing and high CEO confidence. Geopolitical turmoil, including a potential confrontation over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and faltering negotiations to form a coalition government in Germany, failed to dampen M&A; spirits. “Geopolitical uncertainty has had relatively little impact on our deals pipeline this year,” said Cyrus Kapadia, vice chairman of investment banking at Lazard Ltd. “Boards are supportive of deal-making where there is clear strategic rationale, and even in Britain, where Brexit is causing some uncertainty, companies are still pursuing large-scale deals to enhance organic growth,” he added. EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC M&A; UP A 16 percent year-on-year drop in M&A; in the United States to $1.4 trillion was offset on a global basis by a 16 percent rise in M&A; in Europe to $856 billion and an 11 percent rise in Asia-Pacific M&A; to $912 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Among this year’s biggest acquisitions were U.S. drugstore chain operator CVS Health Corp’s $69 billion agreement to buy health insurer Aetna Inc; Walt Disney Co’s $52 billion deal to buy film and television businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc; and aerospace supplier United Technologies Corp’s $30 billion agreement to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc. Many of these deals had stock as part of the purchase price, with acquirers emboldened to use their own shares as currency given their high stock market valuations, as opposed to offering just cash. “We are seeing a stock component becoming a bigger portion of the offers being made, perhaps because the deals are bigger and transformative, and acquirers are looking to offer targets additional upside in these transactions,” said Stephen Arcano, an M&A; partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.  Private equity-backed M&A; activity totaled $322.6 billion globally in 2017, a 27 percent increase compared to last year, as more buyout firms sought to put money they have raised from their investors to work. Dealmakers say the prospect of the U.S. tax overhaul has so far had little influence on deal negotiations. “If you are an acquirer, you are likely modeling a deal  where the synergies and the incremental value of combining is what is driving your purchase price and your premium, not an assumption on the underlying tax rate,” said Chris Ventresca, global M&A; co-head at ‎JPMorgan Chase & Co. “If you are considering selling the entire company, as long as the buyer is willing to pay your price, you take the certainty of crystallizing a premium now with some ability to participate in tax reform upside via buyer stock,” Ventresca added. Companies may decide to allocate more of their cash to M&A; in 2018 following the implementation of the U.S. tax changes, however. “U.S. companies with lots of cash trapped overseas can now more easily put capital to work in the M&A; market, while Europeans may try to take advantage of favorable tax policies to do more deals in the United States,” said Dietrich Becker, co-head of European advisory at Perella Weinberg Partners LP.

1499,DIS,Fox TV producers offered assurances ahead of Disney merger,"PASADENA, Calif. (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) executives have voiced support for the Fox television studio’s adult-oriented programming and development is continuing as usual while a proposed merger undergoes regulatory review, Fox executives and producers said Thursday. In December, Disney announced plans to acquire the Fox TV studio, the FX and National Geographic cable channels and other assets from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) conglomerate. Fox produces edgy adult comedies such as “Family Guy” and gory dramas such as “American Horror Story” that contrast with Disney’s family-friendly movies and TV shows. Ryan Murphy, producer of several Fox and FX hits including “American Horror Story,” said he received a phone call from Disney CEO Bob Iger and was blunt about his concerns. “The stuff that I do is not specifically Disney,” Murphy said he told Iger. “I’m concerned about that. Am I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in ‘American Horror Story?’” Iger told him Disney was interested in buying Fox because it believes in its assets, executives and creators, said Murphy, who spoke at a Television Critics Association meeting where networks promote upcoming shows. Murphy said he will wait to decide whether to keep working with Fox after the merger, but added that he was hopeful about its future. He noted that Iger had successfully integrated Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Entertainment “while keeping their communities intact.”  “I’m interested in seeing what that company is going to look like before I decide where to go,” Murphy said.     The deal sparked anxiety among some other producers of Fox shows, said Gary Newman, co-chairman and co-CEO of Fox Television Group. Newman said he met with many producers to assure them it was “business as usual” during the regulatory review, which is projected to take 12 to 18 months.         “When we did hear from Disney management, they were incredibly vocal to us about how much they like our brand, how much they admire the programming we did,” Newman said. “Every expectation we have is that they are not acquiring Fox to turn it into some form of a PG company,” he added. “My expectation is they are going to be encouraging of our content.” “Family Guy” creator Seth MacFarlane, who also said he received a call from Iger, shrugged off the pending acquisition. “This kind of stuff happens often now,” he said. “I don’t think anything will change that much.” ",1042018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-disney/fox-tv-producers-offered-assurances-ahead-of-disney-merger-idUSKBN1ET2GD

Disney is moving heavily into online delivery of its TV shows and movies as viewers abandon traditional cable, and at one point had explored an acquisition of Twitter. At the same time, Twitter and Facebook are trying to attract audiences to video content on their platforms. “Given our evolving business and the businesses Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey are in, it has become increasingly difficult for them to avoid conflicts relating to board matters, and they are not standing for re-election,” Disney said in a statement.

Disney also disclosed on Friday that compensation for its chief executive, Robert Iger, declined by 17 percent in fiscal 2017 to $36.3 million.

Overall business was solid rather than spectacular with a four-day total in the $190 million range, according to comScore. “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” which will finish the holiday with nearly $290 million in 29 days, now ranks as the eighth highest grosser released in 2017. “‘Jumanji’ has in essence hit the reset button and is now behaving more like a film in its second weekend rather than its fourth,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore. “In the wake of a startling late run ascension to the number one spot, ‘Jumanji’ continues to energize the early 2018 box office marketplace while this weekend taking on a host of wide release newcomers.” Disney noted Sunday that “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” had reached a worldwide total of $1.264 billion, topping Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” ($1.263 billion) and Universal’s “The Fate of the Furious” ($1.236 billion) to become the top global release of 2017 and the tenth-highest global release of all time. “Jumanji,” starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, provided the most substantive challenge to “The Last Jedi” after opening Dec. 20. It’s the most successful title for Sony since “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” which pulled in $337 million domestically during the summer. “The Post,” starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep in a story about the 1971 publication of the Pentagon Papers, attracted an older audience with 66 percent over 35. It received an A Cinemascore with ComScore’s PostTrak audience survey showing solid response with 63 percent rating the drama a “definite recommend” — indicating strong playability in coming weeks, according to Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution. “We see a real opportunity for attracting young people who are politically aware due to the timeliness of the subject matter,” he added. “The Post” took in $4.3 million in two weeks of limited release, so its domestic total has hit $26.7 million. The National Board of Review named “The Post” the best film of 2017 with Hanks and Streep winning the acting awards and the Producers Guild nominated it as one of its top 11 films but it was denied nominations last week from the Directors Guild and Writers Guild. “The Post” has an 88 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes. “The Commuter,” starring Neeson as a businessman drawn into a criminal conspiracy on his train ride home. The film finished Friday with around $4.6 million, and has received a B CinemaScore and a 55 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating. The film kicks off a long-term partnership between Lionsgate and StudioCanal that will continue with “Early Man” and “Shaun the Sheep Movie 2.” “Paddington 2” was coming in slightly under expectations. Warner Bros. acquired the North American rights for the sequel film, starring the popular British children’s literary character, from the Weinstein Company in November after the sexual harassment allegations against former head Harvey Weinstein left the production company and distributor a toxic name. “Paddington 2,” in which Ben Whishaw voices the accident-prone bear, has already earned $125 million internationally and has garnered a 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. “Proud Mary,” starring Taraji P. Henson, opened at the lower end of expectations for Sony’s Screen Gems. The film, which carries a modest $14 million budget, was marketed toward Henson’s fan base. She portrays a hit woman working for an organized crime family in Boston, whose life is completely turned around when she meets a young boy whose path she crosses when a professional hit goes bad. Critics were unimpressed and gave “Proud Mary” a 23 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.",1142018,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-boxoffice/box-office-jumanji-dominates-mlk-weekend-the-post-leads-newcomers-idUSL1N1P90CU

1508,DIS,Shari Redstone explores adding new CBS directors: WSJ,"(Reuters) - Shari Redstone, a controlling shareholder of CBS Corp, has discussed adding new directors to the CBS board as she renews her push to merge the company with Viacom Inc, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Shari Redstone and Sumner Redstone, her ailing 94-year-old father, together control both CBS and Viacom Inc through their privately owned movie theater company, National Amusements Inc. The Redstones failed in an attempt to merge the two companies in 2016. Shari Redstone, who is vice chair of the CBS board, has had exploratory conversations with CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves and directors about recombining the companies, sources have told Reuters. While Moonves is receptive to a combination, he has some reservations, sources have told Reuters. Spokesmen for CBS and Viacom declined to comment.   CBS is looking to replace several of its directors at its annual shareholders meeting in May, and Shari Redstone is gathering names of possible candidates, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Shari Redstone’s push to revisit a CBS merger with Viacom has become more pressing in light of Walt Disney Co’s  planned acquisition of a majority of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) assets, the sources told Reuters.  A combined CBS, which owns cable networks including Showtime and The Movie Channel as well as the CBS TV Network and CBS TV Studios, and Viacom, whose businesses include Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Movies and MTV Films, would have more negotiating leverage with cable and satellite companies. In addition, Shari Redstone does not want to wait for the verdict on the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit to block AT&T; Inc’s  $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc , which is set to go to trial in March, the sources told Reuters. The Justice Department is suing to block that deal on the grounds that it is anti-competitive. If that deal were to fall through, it would mean both AT&T; and Time Warner Inc may look for other companies to combine with, sources have said.  Viacom’s new CEO, Bob Bakish, has improved relations with distributors, found financing for Paramount Pictures after Chinese investors dropped out and shuffled programming.   Even so, Viacom’s stock is trading around $32 a share, below the $35-$38.80 range it was trading at when it and CBS explored a merger in late 2016. It is unclear if the valuation and corporate governance issues that caused the deal to fail in 2016 remain. Some analysts said they believe the selloff in Viacom, along with the consolidation in the media space, should prompt CBS to revisit the deal. “We think now is as good a time as any to reexamine why we continue to believe this deal is the most logical and appropriate transaction to take place within our media coverage universe,” MoffettNathanson analysts wrote this week.

1510,DIS,UPDATE 4-UK regulator puts hurdle in path of Murdoch's $15.7 billion Sky deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s $15.7 billion takeover of European broadcaster Sky  should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent the media tycoon from influencing the network’s news output, Britain’s competition regulator said. The initial ruling complicates a separate plan by Walt Disney Co to buy the majority of Murdoch’s assets, including Sky. Disney had hoped Murdoch would own 100 percent of the company by the time it completed its takeover.  Shares in Sky rose on Tuesday as investors said concerns about Murdoch’s influence could still be overcome, for example by spinning off Sky News, Britain’s first 24-hour news channel. The regulator also indicated it would not object to Disney owning Sky eventually. “It’s good news today that the regulator isn’t going to block the deal outright,” said Michael Wegener, managing director at Case Equity Partners, a Sky shareholder. “The Murdochs will come up with remedies that work around Sky News.” Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in December 2016, re-igniting a political row in Britain about the influence he wields through his ownership of newspapers the Sun and the Times and his stake in Sky, the biggest pay-TV platform. Critics of the deal argue that Murdoch could hold sway over the editorial output of Sky’s loss making news channel. Sky warned that were the deal to be rejected because of Sky News, it could shut the channel itself.  The British government, which will take the final decision on the deal, asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to judge if Murdoch had too much influence in Britain and would uphold broadcasting standards.  “We have provisionally found that if the Fox/Sky merger went ahead as proposed, it would be against the public interest,” the CMA’s Anne Lambert said on Tuesday.  “It would result in the Murdoch family having too much control over news providers in the UK, and too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.” Murdoch’s news outlets are watched, read or heard by nearly a third of Britons and have a combined share of public news consumption that is significantly greater than all other news providers, except the BBC and commercial TV news provider ITN. Possible ways to resolve concerns about Murdoch’s influence in Britain could include spinning off or divesting Sky News, or insulating Sky News from Fox’s influence, the CMA said. A third option is to block the deal outright.  On the issue of broadcasting standards, the regulator cleared Murdoch, saying that recent allegations of sexual harassment at his Fox News network in the United States did not call into question his commitment to standards in Britain. An objection on broadcasting standards would have likely sounded the death knell for the deal. “Broadcasting standards is not an issue anymore,” said one hedge fund manager that holds Sky shares. “That’s a pretty big positive.” The manager cautioned however that it was unclear how motivated the Murdochs were to secure the deal, seeing as they have already agreed to offload it to Disney. Shares in Sky, which also has major operations in Germany and Italy, rose 2.3 percent to 10.26 pounds by 1335 GMT. Fox agreed to pay 10.75 pounds in cash for each Sky share in December 2016. “The initial reaction would be to suggest there is an easy fix in that Sky News could be disposed of, either by sale or closure or some other form,” said broker Liberum, which downgraded Sky to hold from buy. “However, the language of the CMA in its provisional findings suggests they are more minded to blocking the deal as a way of addressing concerns.” Fox has already offered up remedies to protect the independence of Sky News including the establishment of a Sky News Editorial Board.  But the CMA said media regulator Ofcom had received complaints suggesting that previous attempts by Murdoch to guarantee the editorial independence of the Times newspapers in Britain and the Dow Jones company had proved ineffective.  The CMA said a “comprehensive solution” to the questions posed by the deal would be simply to block it. Fox said it was disappointed about the provisional judgment, although it welcomed the decision that it had a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. It said it would continue to engage with the CMA ahead of the final report in May, and it anticipated approval of the deal by June 30. Britain’s newly appointed Media Secretary Matt Hancock said on Tuesday he would decide on the deal by 14 June, 30 working days after he is due to receive the CMA’s final report.    An eventual rejection would be a personal blow to Murdoch, who has spent decades building ties with prime ministers and politicians in Britain. His son James oversaw Sky’s growth as chief executive and currently chairs the broadcaster. The 86-year-old tycoon sought to buy Sky in 2010, but a phone-hacking scandal at his News of the World tabloid forced him to drop the bid. Since then he has split his companies into two to separate the newspapers from the TV businesses. If Fox is eventually blocked, Disney could buy the rest of Sky itself at a later date, and it would face fewer regulatory objections than the Murdochs. “On the face of it, these concerns would fall away if the Disney/Fox transaction went ahead as announced,” the CMA said. Disney will buy Fox’s 39 percent Sky stake in its $52.4 billion purchase of Fox assets, a deal that faces its own lengthy regulatory process in the United States.  That level of ownership would normally require an owner to bid for the whole company, but Disney has asked regulators to allow it leeway to decide whether to bid or not.

1512,DIS,Netflix crosses $100 billion market capitalization as subscribers surge,"(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) snagged 2 million more subscribers than Wall Street expected in the final three months of 2017, tripling profits at the online video service that is burning money on new programming to dominate internet television around the world. The results drove Netflix to a market capitalization of more than $100 billion for the first time. Shares jumped 9 percent to over $248 in after-hours trading on Monday after rallying throughout the month and rising 53 percent last year. (tmsnrt.rs/1Ry82wG) The company has signed up more than half of all U.S. broadband households and is building its customer base in 190 countries by spending billions on programming. Netflix picked up 6.36 million subscribers in international markets from October through December, when it released new seasons of critically acclaimed shows “Stranger Things” and “The Crown” as well as Will Smith action movie “Bright.” That topped Wall Street expectations of 5.1 million, according to FactSet.   Along with 1.98 million customer additions in the United States, the company ended the year with 117.58 million streaming subscribers around the globe, despite a price hike in October. “Netflix is pouring more and more money into making content, and it is directly translating into more subscribers,” BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. “They see a huge opportunity and they are moving as fast as they can to attack it.”  The company also said it took a $39 million non-cash charge for “unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward with.” A source familiar with the matter said the charge was related to content starring Kevin Spacey, with whom Netflix cut ties after he was accused of sexual misconduct.  Netflix temporarily halted production of “House of Cards” to write out Spacey’s character and decided not to release the film “Gore,” which starred Spacey as Gore Vidal. Spacey has apologized to one of his accusers, and according to his representatives is seeking unspecified treatment. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the accusations. The charge is one of the first signs of costs faced by companies in the wake of a widespread campaign against sexual harassment. Netflix turned a DVD-by-mail business into an online competitor of movie channel HBO. As it grew it began licensing its own original shows to ensure a stream of new offerings if studio suppliers ended deals. In fact, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is making a major push into online streaming and will pull its first-run shows and movies from Netflix in 2019 as Hollywood fights for audiences. Netflix plans to spend up to $8 billion this year on TV shows and movies to fend off Disney, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), studios-owned Hulu and local competitors that are jumping into online video, and it is turning more and more to high-budget projects, such as the roughly $90 million “Bright.” In 2017, Netflix recorded its first full-year profit in international markets. The company has said it is aiming for steady improvements in profitability overseas this year.  “We believe our big investments in content are paying off,” Netflix said in a quarterly letter to shareholders. Netflix is raising its marketing budget faster than revenue is growing and will spend about $2 billion this year. The company expects negative cash flow in 2018 of $3 billion to $4 billion, up from $2 billion in 2017.  Last October, Netflix raised prices for two of its three main subscription plans to help fund the substantial content investment. The earnings report showed customers took it in stride.  “Consumers are tolerant as long as something’s improving,” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, on a post-earnings webcast, said of the price increase.  For the December quarter, Netflix reported diluted earnings-per-share of 41 cents, even with the expectations of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue for the three months totaled $3.286 billion, in line with forecasts. Looking ahead, Netflix forecast streaming customer additions of 6.35 million for the first quarter, above analysts’ expectation of 5.01 million, according to FactSet. Investors appear confident in Netflix’s ability to grow. Netflix recently traded at 91 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, versus Amazon at 152 times earnings and Disney at 17 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.

1514,DIS,Breakingviews - Rupert Murdoch’s next foe: Sky hedge fund holdouts,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rupert Murdoch’s next foe in his battle for Sky may be hedge funds. The tycoon’s Twenty-First Century Fox should be able to win regulatory approval to buy the 61 percent it doesn’t own of the pay-TV group. But holdouts could attempt to sink the deal unless they get a higher price. The UK competition authority on Tuesday said Fox’s 11.7 billion pound bid would give Murdoch too much influence over British news. But it also said that its concerns would fall away if Walt Disney’s $52 billion offer for Fox assets, including Sky, goes ahead. In the meantime, Fox can ring-fence Sky’s news operation to protect its independence. Sky investors may be less forgiving. Eight hedge funds have acquired shares or derivatives equivalent to 13 percent of Sky’s capital since mid-December, according to a Breakingviews analysis. Fox needs support from three-quarters of independent shareholders for the deal to go through. Assuming 80 percent turn up to vote, a rebellion equivalent to just 12 percent of Sky’s capital could sink it. Investors could justify a higher price than the 10.75 pounds on offer. Sky’s core business selling TV subscriptions in Britain has grown steadily since Fox’s December 2016 offer; group revenue was 5 percent higher year-on-year in the six months to the end of 2017, the company said on Thursday. Then there are the imminent auctions for England’s Premier League soccer. Sky currently pays almost 1.4 billion pounds a year to broadcast the games.  But rival bidder BT is cash-strapped, and the two have struck a deal to show each other’s TV channels, suggesting bidding may be less fierce than previously.  Investec reckons even a 20 percent step up in rights costs could add 39 pence to Sky’s share price. Lastly, there’s Disney. Even if Murdoch were to refuse to increase his offer, Disney may want to buy out the minorities itself later. Opposing Fox may backfire. Murdoch could reduce the acceptance threshold to just 50 percent by switching to a takeover offer rather than a scheme of arrangement. And the Magic Kingdom’s motives aren’t clear; it might be happy to leave minority shareholders outstanding for years.  Sky’s share price is languishing about 4 percent below the offer price, which augurs poorly for a bump. But with the regulatory fog clearing, there’s scope for another twist in the takeover drama.",1252018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-rupert-murdochs-next-foe-sky-hedge-fund-holdouts-idUSKBN1FE1GW
1515,DIS,UPDATE 2-TV dramas boost Sky as its own takeover saga drags on,"* First-half earnings rise 10 pct * Customer base up 365,000 to 22.9 mln * Working with regulator on Fox takeover process (Adds CEO comments, shares, reaction) By Paul Sandle LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Hit shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Riviera” helped Sky deliver a 10 percent rise in first-half earnings, underscoring the appeal of the European pay-TV group to the U.S. media companies trying to buy it. Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox was provisionally blocked this week from buying the shares in Sky it does not already own, although there are options that would allow the $15.7 billion deal to do through. Sky, whose customer base rose by 365,000 in the half to 22.9 million, could then be sold to Disney if a separate sale of Murdoch’s TV and film assets receives the green light. The British broadcaster reported revenue of 6.7 billion pounds ($9.6 billion) for the six months to the end of December, up 5 percent year-on-year and in line with the first quarter, while core earnings rose to 1.1 billion pounds. “This performance reflects the investment choices we have made in recent years, allowing us to more than offset the pressure on consumer spending across Europe, as more customers continue to choose Sky for more of their services,” Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said. Shares in Sky, which are trading at the highest levels since Fox announced its 10.75 pound-a-share bid in Dec 2016, were up 1 percent at 10.34 pounds at 0948 GMT. The satellite-company, which operates in Italy, Germany and Austria as well as Britain and Ireland, said it would pay an interim dividend of 13.06 pence a share, on top of a special dividend of 10 pence, which UBS analysts said was a positive surprise. Darroch said the company’s investment in original programming, such as dramas “Riviera” and “Tin Star”, drove viewing figures for Sky’s own channels up 6 percent. “We have an exceptional line-up of acquired series, and when you add to that our own Sky Originals, it puts us in what I think is the strongest content position we’ve ever had,” he told reporters on Thursday. The results come two days after Britain’s competition regulatory ruled that Fox’s bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own was not in the public interest. Murdoch, who also owns newspapers in Britain, now has to come up with an arrangement that will prevent him from influencing the news agenda at Sky, for instance by spinning off its Sky News channel. Darroch said Sky, along with Fox, was focused on this media ownership hurdle after the competition regulator dismissed concerns about Murdoch’s commitment to broadcasting standards. “We are very much focused in the process with the (regulator) CMA,” he told reporters. “We have (media) plurality as the final issue to work though,(...) and we’ll see where that takes us.” He would not comment on the company’s thinking about Sky News, saying any messages about the 24-hour service would be given directly to staff. “We have got a day job to do,” he said. “And I think you can see from results and the plan we are laying out for 2018 we are not being distracted from any of that.” Before the government gives its final decision on the Fox deal in June, Sky faces the next auction for English Premier League rights, the cornerstone of its offer to soccer fans. Some of the pressure on Sky to pay huge sums to retain the biggest packages of games has been eased by a deal it struck with its biggest rival BT to supply channels on each other’s platform. Darroch said he wouldn’t give a running commentary on the auction, adding Sky’s bid strategy was commercially sensitive.

1516,DIS,Big brands from Disney to Walmart back tech startups to tackle supply chain slavery,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A $23 million venture fund aiming to tackle the threat of forced labor in big businesses with the help of tech startups was launched on Tuesday, backed by brands from Disney to Walmart. Humanity United, a U.S.-based foundation, has partnered with major corporations and the British government to create Working Capital, a first-of-its-kind fund to invest in innovations to ensure that companies’ supply chains are free of modern slavery. The fund has received capital from the C&A; Foundation, affiliated with fashion retailer C&A;, the Walmart Foundation, and Walt Disney Co among others, according to Humanity United.   In recent years modern slavery has increasingly come under the global spotlight, putting ever greater regulatory and consumer pressure on firms to ensure their supply chains are free of forced labor, child labor and other forms of slavery. From cosmetics and clothes to shrimp and smartphones, supply chains are often complex with multiple layers across various countries - whether in sourcing the raw materials or creating the final product - making it hard to identify exploitation. “There is a growing market demand for more transparent and responsible corporate supply chains,” Ed Marcum, managing director at Working Capital, said in a statement. “We see an opportunity to invest in emerging solutions that will meet the demands of large multinational corporations while also benefiting millions of vulnerable workers,” Marcum added. The fund, which received 2.5 million pounds ($3.5 million) from Britain’s foreign aid department (DFID), is investing in new technologies to map supply chains and help workers to raise grievances, find legitimate employers, and know their rights.

1517,DIS,Big brands from Disney to Walmart back tech startups to tackle supply chain slavery,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A $23 million venture fund aiming to tackle the threat of forced labor in big businesses with the help of tech startups was launched on Tuesday, backed by brands from Disney to Walmart. Humanity United, a U.S.-based foundation, has partnered with major corporations and the British government to create Working Capital, a first-of-its-kind fund to invest in innovations to ensure that companies’ supply chains are free of modern slavery. The fund has received capital from the C&A; Foundation, affiliated with fashion retailer C&A;, the Walmart Foundation, and Walt Disney Co among others, according to Humanity United.   In recent years modern slavery has increasingly come under the global spotlight, putting ever greater regulatory and consumer pressure on firms to ensure their supply chains are free of forced labor, child labor and other forms of slavery. From cosmetics and clothes to shrimp and smartphones, supply chains are often complex with multiple layers across various countries - whether in sourcing the raw materials or creating the final product - making it hard to identify exploitation. “There is a growing market demand for more transparent and responsible corporate supply chains,” Ed Marcum, managing director at Working Capital, said in a statement. “We see an opportunity to invest in emerging solutions that will meet the demands of large multinational corporations while also benefiting millions of vulnerable workers,” Marcum added. The fund, which received 2.5 million pounds ($3.5 million) from Britain’s foreign aid department (DFID), is investing in new technologies to map supply chains and help workers to raise grievances, find legitimate employers, and know their rights. Its portfolio includes Provenance, which uses blockchain to trace products from producer to consumer, and Ulula, a platform helping firms to measure risky practices in their supply chains. “Human rights abuses like modern slavery are still far too common and businesses are ... investing in innovative technology that will root out these unacceptable practices for good,” DFID minister Penny Mordaunt said in a statement.

1518,DIS,"UPDATE 2-Mattel reports surprise loss for holiday period, shares sink","(Reuters) - Mattel Inc (MAT.O) reported a surprise loss for the holiday quarter on Thursday, as the toy maker faced weak demand for key brands including Fisher-Price and as the effect of the collapse of Toys “R” Us lingered. Shares of the biggest U.S. toy maker fell 7.3 percent to $14.20 in after-hours trading. Mattel reported a net loss of $281.3 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, hurt by a one-time, $457-million charge related to new U.S. tax laws. Excluding one-time items, Mattel reported a loss of 72 cents per share, while analysts on average had expected earnings of 17 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. El Segundo, California-based Mattel has faced weak demand in recent years for its most well-known products including Hot Wheels and Barbie as children increasingly prefer videogames and electronics over traditional toys. The company’s stock fell 44 percent last year. The September bankruptcy of major toy retailer Toys “R” Us, while highlighting the struggles facing the industry, heaped more pressure on Mattel and other toy makers to find other outlets for sales. In response, Mattel scrapped its dividend payout to free up cash. Sales in the company’s construction, arts and crafts unit that includes Lego competitor Mega Blocks sank 25 percent in the holiday quarter, while sales from Fisher-Price toys dipped 12 percent. Mattel’s gross margin — gross profit as a percentage of revenue — fell to 32 percent from 47 percent in the year-earlier quarter, as advertising costs shot up 18 percent. Mattel has attracted takeover bids from rival Hasbro Inc (HAS.O), which it has snubbed. Hasbro has fared better after snagging the rights to sell toys modeled on Disney princesses, when Mattel’s Disney (DIS.N) contract expired last year. The two toy makers have also been competing for lucrative contracts with Hollywood studios in the past few years as demand for traditional toys falls. Still, Mattel’s Barbie made a comeback in the holiday period as sales from the iconic brand rose 9 percent after four quarters of declines. Efforts to revitalize the line of dolls, including changes to skin tones and adding plus-sized and hijab-wearing models appeared to be paying off. Mattel’s net revenue fell 12.1 percent to $1.61 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $1.69 billion.

In separate statements, each company said that there is no assurance that the process will result in a transaction, and  they would not comment further until the process is completed. Viacom shares rose 1.5 percent to $33.70 in after-hours trading, and CBS shares climbed 0.5 percent to $59.25. The companies had previously explored a merger in 2016 at the urging of ailing 94-year-old Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari, who control CBS and Viacom through privately held National Amusements Inc.  Those talks failed due to concerns by CBS’ directors and Moonves over governance issues and the deal’s financial sense for CBS shareholders. But Shari Redstone has continued to discuss with executives at both companies her desire to merge the two, which intensified after Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) announced in December it would buy a majority of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) assets, sources have said. “National Amusements supports the processes announced by CBS and Viacom to evaluate a combination of the two companies, which we believe has the potential to drive significant, long-term shareholder value,” the company said in a statement.  CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves and Viacom CEO Bob Bakish held discussions in January about a potential deal. The boards of both companies decided on Thursday to begin a formal process to explore the deal through special committees.  The deal would pair CBS’s broadcast network, television studios and Showtime cable network with Viacom’s Paramount Pictures, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV. That could help CBS’ streaming service compete with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and boost the combined company’s leverage with cable and satellite distributors.  It also could provide an edge with advertisers, UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a research note. CBS would gain access to Viacom technology that uses data to help brands better target their messages, and the combined company could sell packages across the broadcast and pay TV networks.  “Increased scale in ratings would allow the combined company to go into the ad market with a larger inventory across a broader demographic,” Hodulik said, “potentially allowing for higher overall ad rates by selling across properties.”  “We expect a transaction to be a positive development for both sets of shareholders in the near term,” he added.

1522,DIS,"EXPLAINER-Breaking News, Murdoch edging towards solution to bring Sky in house","LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Fox is hoping the creation of an independent editorial board to protect the news channel at bid target Sky (SKYB.L) will satisfy regulators and allow it to finally take control of the European pay-TV group.  Britain’s competition regulator told Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) last month that Murdoch’s near eight-year, $15.7 billion pursuit of Sky would be blocked unless a way is found to prevent the media mogul from influencing Sky News after a deal. Fox had earlier offered to create an editorial board with a majority of independent directors. People familiar with the matter, lawyers and investors believe a stronger mechanism to guarantee independence should be enough to gain approval.  The takeover is being closely watched in the United States where Fox has agreed to sell most of its assets including Sky to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), which wants to buy all of Sky in the deal and not just the 39 percent that Fox already owns. Fox is likely to have taken encouragement from a comment from the regulator that given that Fox may not own Sky for long, it will be willing to accept the most cost-effective solution. “Fox are still confident they can get the deal done,” a person familiar with the situation said. “They’re working on new suggestions for the remedies.” As Britain’s biggest owner of national newspapers, every move by Murdoch is scrutinised by his political allies and enemies alike. Britain’s competition regulator worries that a deal to own all of Sky News would give him too much sway over public opinion.    Prime Minister Theresa May’s government has the final say on the deal, but will have to stick to the regulator’s advice or face possible legal action.            Lawyers and consultants think Fox can land Sky by offering a fully independent board for Sky News and long-term funding, preventing it from having to make the more costly option of spinning off the channel or selling it completely.     Sky, Europe’s leading pay-TV provider in 23 million homes across Britain, Ireland, Austria, Germany and Italy, has kept up the pressure by warning it could close the loss-making but award-winning channel if it prevented a takeover.         ROLLING NEWS Sky News launched in 1989 when Murdoch, having shaken up the newspaper market, sought to smash the dominance of the BBC and commercial network ITV by launching four channels as part of a new paid-for satellite service.     The 24-hour channel, the first in Britain to follow in the footsteps of global pioneer CNN, immediately gave the fledgling network visibility, and it has punched above its weight in terms of influence ever since.    Watched closely in newsrooms, boardrooms and the offices of state, Sky News is a politically neutral outlet that has forced the taxpayer-funded BBC to up its game in rolling news.    The challenge is to find a system that protects Sky News’ independence without forcing so much separation that it puts the channel into financial jeopardy. Murdoch has funded Sky News through nearly 30 years of losses.         It has an average weekly reach of 4.4 million viewers, or  average share of TV viewing of 0.56 percent, according to BARB ratings for the week ended Jan. 21. It reaches millions more through its online and radio output.    In its provisional findings, the competition regulator suggested a system where independent directors form an Editorial Board for Sky News, perhaps appointed by media regulator Ofcom.     The Board would appoint the head of Sky News, who would in turn retain editorial control.    The regulator has asked interested parties to respond.     “It is a difficult circle to square,” said a competition lawyer who is familiar with the case. “It has to be independent enough to still be a viable independent voice, but not so independent that it is left to wither away.     “But it can be done.” Were the government and regulator to decide that the proposal does not go far enough, they could insist that in order to complete the deal, Fox should spin off or sell Sky News.     In 2011, when Murdoch last tried and failed to buy Sky, he offered to put the news outlet into a new company with shares given to existing Sky shareholders. Reviewing the different options, the regulator has noted that Sky News has never previously constituted a standalone business, perhaps indicating its fears about how it would fare.     The regulator has also acknowledged that Sky could next year  be owned by Disney, a business that doesn’t have any news outlets in Britain, meaning its concerns would lapse.     Fox is now working on a response and is likely to address the concerns raised by the regulator about its earlier plan, including how the board members would be appointed and whether a majority of independents would be enough.  Twenty-First Century Fox and Sky declined to comment. “As long as Fox is willing to submit the right remedies, it will get done,” said one hedge fund manager with investments in both companies.     But the lengthy process has caused agitation among some shareholders, who say Fox should now stump up more than the headline 10.75 pounds per share.   “Basically, here is Fox being bought-out on 12 times cashflow,” Crispin Odey, whose hedge fund is a 0.9 percent investor in Sky, said in December. “If we (Sky shareholders) were being sold on 12 times cashflow we’d be at 12.30 pounds.”  Activist investor Elliott Management Corp, founded by Paul Singer, has also built a stake in Sky of 1.29 percent.  One London-based adviser said: “An effective ring-fencing of Sky News in some form should solve all the concerns of the regulator. Once that is done, Elliott is likely to push for a better price.”  Media Secretary Matt Hancock has said he will rule on the deal by June 14.  If approved, it will go to a vote of Sky independent shareholders, paving the way for the 86-year-old Murdoch to finally get his hands on a company he has long coveted.

1523,DIS,"Theme parks lift Disney profit, more 'Star Wars' coming","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street forecasts as theme park crowds packed a new “Avatar” land, making up for a decline at the ABC broadcasting network. Shares of Disney rose 2.7 percent in after-hours trading to $108.99. Through Tuesday’s close, Disney shares had fallen 1.3 percent this year, compared with 0.8 percent increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The media and entertainment conglomerate reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 for October through December, ahead of the $1.61 analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also announced it was expanding its “Star Wars” universe, hiring the creators of HBO hit “Game of Thrones,” David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, to write and produce a new series of films set in the galaxy far, far away.    Disney is working to transform itself over the next few years from a traditional media company into a digital entertainment leader to reach audiences that prefer to watch TV shows and movies online through subscription services such as Netflix. In December, Disney announced a $52.4 billion deal to buy film, television and international assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, a move that will allow it to offer more programming to online viewers. Investors have been rattled by the loss of pay TV subscribers to ESPN, Disney’s largest network. That trend continued in the quarter, which also was hit by fewer college football games compared with a year earlier. The revenue paid by distributors to carry ESPN rose.  Profit at the media networks division fell 12 percent, mostly due to a decline at ABC, which saw lower advertising revenue and income from program sales, plus higher production cost write-downs.  To counter the shift to online viewing, Disney will launch a streaming service for sports fans in the spring called ESPN Plus to reach digital audiences, followed by a family entertainment offering in 2019. ESPN Plus will cost $4.99 per month, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said on a conference call. “The company has clear tailwinds heading into 2018,” GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.     For the December quarter, Disney reported net income of $4.42 billion and said revenue rose 3.8 percent to $15.4 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $15.46 billion. The media conglomerate recorded a $1.6 billion gain due to recent changes to the U.S. tax law. The theme parks division generated $1.3 billion in operating income for the quarter, helped by strong park attendance and cruise ship bookings over the Christmas and New Year’s holidays, Disney said. Visitors flocked to an “Avatar”-themed land at Walt Disney World in Florida and to a “Guardians of the Galaxy” ride at Disneyland Resort in California, the company said.  Disney’s movie studio turned out three blockbusters in the quarter. They were “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” “Thor: Ragnarok” and “Coco,” but operating income at the studio fell because of lower home entertainment and streaming sales.

1525,DIS,Breakingviews - Disney Netflix-with-theme-parks recast looks scary,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Walt Disney’s decision to recast itself as Netflix with theme parks looks scary. The House of Mouse is set to assimilate $52 billion of Twenty-First Century Fox’s assets. Chief Executive Bob Iger also has to steady ESPN, deal with declining TV networks and potential “Star Wars” fatigue while building video-streaming products to reach viewers directly. That alone is a costly endeavor. Disney’s free cash flow will plummet some $4 billion between its 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, reckon Bernstein analysts – an almost 30 percent decline. Iger’s decision to pull the company’s programs from Netflix by the end of this year also means it’ll forfeit licensing revenue. On top of that, netting a sizable enough audience to match its now arch-rival’s more than 100 million of global subscribers is no easy feat – even though Disney’s nameplate and sizable library should ensure instant recognition. Meanwhile, its sports network’s woes continued. Disney may have managed to beat overall estimates for its first-quarter earnings, unveiled on Tuesday, thanks in part to a 14 percent rise in operating income at its theme parks.  But ESPN lost more viewers on top of the previous quarter’s 3 percent decline – and advertising revenue fell 11 percent year-over-year. ESPN is set to launch its own video-streaming service in the spring, but it needs leadership. Former President John Skipper abruptly resigned just before Christmas, citing substance-abuse problems. That’s emblematic of Disney’s wider troubles with succession planning. Iger has extended his contract four times and there is still no obvious candidate to take the reins. Even one of Disney’s most successful recent franchises is stumbling. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” brought in $200 million less at the box office than analysts expected in the United States and Canada, according to the Wall Street Journal. That may not bode well either for the Han Solo spinoff due this May or for the two new trilogies in the works – the latest, announced on Tuesday, to be written by the creators of “Game of Thrones.” All this is before having to cope with other TV stations in decline – including the cable networks it’ll get from Fox. Iger’s many challenges will make the next several years a hair-raising ride.",2062018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-walt-disney-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-disney-netflix-with-theme-parks-recast-looks-scary-idUSKBN1FQ392

1530,DIS,New 'Star Wars' films on way from TV's 'Game of Thrones' creators,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney on Tuesday announced it was expanding its “Star Wars” universe, hiring the creators behind HBO’s massive TV hit “Game of Thrones” to write a new series of films set in the galaxy far, far away. The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said in a statement that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss would write and produce the new series, which will be separate from both the episodic Skywalker saga and the recently announced trilogy being developed by director Rian Johnson.

Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, said in a statement that Benioff and Weiss’s “command of complex characters, depth of story and richness of mythology will break new ground and boldly push ‘Star Wars’ in ways I find incredibly exciting.” Disney is also developing “a few” “Star Wars” television series for an upcoming streaming service from the company, Chief Executive Bob Iger said on a conference call.  In November, Disney had announced that Johnson, director of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” would write and direct the first of a new trilogy of films in the sci-fi franchise that would bring new characters and worlds not yet explored on screen. “The Last Jedi,” released in December 2017, has earned more than $1.3 billion at the global box office. Disney had previously committed to making three standalone “Star Wars” films outside of the Skywalker saga.

1531,DIS,UPDATE 2-New 'Star Wars' films on way from TV's 'Game of Thrones' creators,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney on Tuesday announced it was expanding its “Star Wars” universe, hiring the creators behind HBO’s massive TV hit “Game of Thrones” to write a new series of films set in the galaxy far, far away. The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said in a statement that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss would write and produce the new series, which will be separate from both the episodic Skywalker saga and the recently announced trilogy being developed by director Rian Johnson. No release dates or plot details were given. Shares in Disney, which also reported a quarterly profit that topped forecasts on Tuesday, rose nearly 3 percent in after hours trading. Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, said in a statement that Benioff and Weiss’s “command of complex characters, depth of story and richness of mythology will break new ground and boldly push ‘Star Wars’ in ways I find incredibly exciting.” Disney is also developing “a few” “Star Wars” television series for an upcoming streaming service from the company, Chief Executive Bob Iger said on a conference call.  In November, Disney had announced that Johnson, director of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” would write and direct the first of a new trilogy of films in the sci-fi franchise that would bring new characters and worlds not yet explored on screen. “The Last Jedi,” released in December 2017, has earned more than $1.3 billion at the global box office. Disney had previously committed to making three standalone “Star Wars” films outside of the Skywalker saga. They include 2016’s “Rogue One,” and May 2018 release “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” which follows the origins of the roguish smuggler Han Solo, made famous by Harrison Ford in the original 1977 movie.

Comcast’s deliberations indicate that it believes it still has a chance to clinch a deal with Fox, even though it previous bid last year for more than $60 billion was rejected over concerns that regulators worried about media consolidation could thwart it, the sources said. Comcast may decide not to make any new offer, the sources said.

Disney struck a deal with Fox to buy film, television and international businesses. The deal is set to bring to a close more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world’s most important global news and film conglomerates.

1540,DIS,"Campaigners to challenge ""fit and proper"" ruling on Fox bid for Sky in court","LONDON (Reuters) - The decision by regulators that Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) would be a “fit and proper” owner of Sky (SKYB.L) will be challenged in court, campaign group Avaaz said on Wednesday. In a potential new hurdle for the proposed $15.7 billion takeover of Sky, Avaaz said that a High Court judge had allowed the challenge to broadcast regulator Ofcom’s ruling last June that a Fox-controlled Sky would be a ‘fit and proper’ owner of broadcast licenses in Britain. Avaaz said the case would be heard before the end of June, potentially complicating an agreement to sell Sky to Fox and then on to Disney (DIS.N) if a separate sale of tycoon Rupert Murdoch’s TV and film assets receives the green light. The regulator said allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News in the U.S. were extremely serious and disturbing, but had found no clear evidence to suggest senior executives at Fox were aware of the misconduct. “We will defend our ‘fit and proper’ assessment, which was independent, expert and based on the evidence,” an Ofcom spokesman said in a statement.  The deal already faces other obstacles. Last month Britain’s competition regulator said that it should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent Murdoch, who owns the Times and the Sun newspapers, from influencing Sky’s news output.

1541,DIS,Attention turns to bid price after Sky's soccer winner,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sky (SKYB.L) has tightened its grip on English Premier League football rights at a lower price than it currently pays, fuelling speculation that Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) could now be forced to pay more to buy the broadcaster. The positive result for Rupert Murdoch’s European pay-TV company could strengthen the hand of shareholders who want Fox to raise its offer to buy the 61 percent of the group it does not already own.  Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) also had an interest in the outcome because if its $52 billion (37.52 billion pounds) deal to buy Fox assets is cleared, it will end up owning either all of Sky, or the 39 percent stake that Fox currently holds. Shares in Sky rose 3.5 percent to a two-year high of 10.98 pounds, exceeding the 10.75 pounds per share that Fox agreed to pay for the group in December 2016. Analysts at Jefferies said Sky, which has used Premier League football to help build its pay TV business over more than two decades, had emerged as the winner in the auction for domestic TV rights from 2019-22. “Retaining the bulk of English Premier League rights was key for Sky to maintain its premium position, but to do so and secure a lower outlay is a bonus,” they said. Some investors had already argued that Sky should fetch a higher price after Disney agreed to buy Fox’s film, television studios and other assets at a price which they said represented a higher multiple than Fox agreed for Sky. Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who has a stake in Sky, has long argued that Fox should be stumping up more. “It looks like they’re not going to get it at the original price,” he told Reuters on Wednesday. “Our view is they won’t get it for less than 13.40 pounds.” Of the seven packages of matches on offer for three seasons from August 2019, Sky won four for a total outlay of 3.58 billion pounds, while BT will pay 885 million pounds for its one package. Sky said it was spending 16 percent less per game than under its present three-year deal.  Two of the seven packages, both of which involved rights to simultaneous screening of a block of matches, remained unsold at this point, indicating that the Premier League had not met its  reserve price. Analyst Polo Tang at UBS, who forecast no rise in the price Sky would pay when most were expecting a 20-30 percent jump, had said a good result would suggest scope for a higher Fox offer. He said in theory the outcome would lead to a 500 million pound boost to the consensus for 1.7 billion pounds earnings in the 2020 financial year. “We believe Sky will likely use some of this headroom to invest more in original programming,” he said. “(But) materially higher levels of profitability at Sky could lead to shareholders seeking a higher offer price from Fox.” Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) is also considering an intervention in the Disney deal and making a competing offer for the Fox assets, Reuters reported. Such a move could further stoke expectations that Sky is worth more than Fox has agreed to pay. “There’s a lot going on now,” Odey said of Comcast’s potential interest. Like Odey, hedge fund Polygon has questioned the price that Fox has offered and said in December that it thought Sky was worth more than 13 pounds a share. Elliott, the U.S. hedge fund best-known for its activist campaigns at companies, including forcing bidders to pay more during takeovers, has also been stakebuilding in Sky recently and lifted its interest to 1.99 percent last week.

1543,DIS,Hong Kong Disneyland FY loss doubles to $44.1 mln,"HONG KONG, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s Hong Kong theme park operator said on Tuesday its net loss for 2017 doubled to HK$345 million ($44.10 million), marking a third straight year of losses, due to park expansion plans and higher operating costs. Hong Kong Disneyland, the company’s smallest theme park, has been hit by slow local retail and tourism markets and suffered its first loss in four years in 2015. Revenue for the fiscal year ended September 2017 rose 8 percent to HK$5.1 billion, buoyed by a 3 percent increase in number of visitors at 6.2 million. The theme park saw an increase of 5 percent in the number of international visitors, touching a record high of around 1.6 million. More than 70 million guests have visited the park ever since it was launched in 2005, the company said. In 2016, Hong Kong Disneyland said it would invest another $1.4 billion to expand the loss-making park. Iron Man Experience, Disney Park’s first Marvel-themed ride which was launched in January last year, now serves as the most popular attraction at the resort, it said. The Hong Kong-based resort faces stiff competition from other theme park operators such as Ocean Park, which has been vying for mainland Chinese visitors. Hong Kong retail sales ended a three-year slump in 2017, rising 2.2 percent, underpinned by a rise in tourist arrivals from mainland China and upbeat property and share prices that boosted sentiment.

1544,DIS,Comcast's $31 billion Sky bid crashes Murdoch and Disney show,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) has offered $31 billion for Sky Plc (SKYB.L), threatening a plan hatched by Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to seize control of Europe’s biggest pay-TV group. The world’s biggest entertainment company and owner of NBC and Universal Pictures said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain’s Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Murdoch’s Fox has agreed to pay for it. Bob Iger’s Disney has agreed to buy Sky from Fox, along with other assets, in a separate $52 billion follow-up deal. Comcast’s all-cash, unsolicited offer pits CEO Brian Roberts against Murdoch, the 86-year-old tycoon who helped to launch Sky and pioneered pay-TV in Britain. Iger is also a long-time rival after Comcast tried and failed to buy Disney in 2004. “Sky and Comcast are a perfect fit: we are both leaders in creating and distributing content,” Roberts said. Sky’s shares jumped more than 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, indicating that investors expect a bidding war. Shares of Comcast, Fox and Disney fell.  Comcast’s appearance in the already complex Sky drama could prompt Fox to make a higher offer or Disney to make its own direct bid for Sky. Fox remains committed to its cash offer announced in December, it said in a statement.     Media owners have been forced into increasingly aggressive deals after online groups Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) prompted many customers to ditch subscriptions.  Comcast bid $60 billion last year to clinch a deal with Fox, before losing out to Disney.  Sky, which provides sports programming, films and broadband to 23 million homes across Britain, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria, urged its investors to take no action since the approach did not represent a firm offer.  Murdoch’s Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been repeatedly held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain. The shares had been trading above the asking price since  Sky this month agreed to pay less than expected for Premier League soccer rights, likely boosting its future earnings and prompting investors to demand a higher offer. It also attracted the attention of U.S. hedge fund and activist investor Elliott Management Corp, which has built up a 2.5 percent stake in Sky in recent weeks.   Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch who holds 1 percent of Sky, said he expected a counter offer and speculated whether Disney could make a direct bid for Sky to avoid Fox’s regulatory problems. “Once you’re in a bidding war, it’s not about fair value, it’s about what do you think it’s worth,” Odey added.  Formed in 1990, Sky has built its business by offering leading content and technology. It snapped up Murdoch’s pay-TV groups across Europe in 2014 to offer a distribution platform that is now proving attractive to the big U.S. content owners.       Comcast said it had not yet engaged with Sky over the proposal and its finance director, Michael Cavanagh, declined to comment on whether it could lead to a renewed bid for Fox. Comcast will have to gain the support of Sky’s independent directors if it does not make a hostile bid because its chairman is Murdoch’s son James, who is also CEO of Fox. Comcast’s Roberts, the son of Ralph who founded the company in 1963, called Sky’s Deputy Chairman Martin Gilbert on Tuesday morning to notify him just before the offer statement was released, and called Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch shortly afterwards. Sky’s independent directors are expected to meet in the coming days to discuss the offer and the company said they were mindful of their duties to investors. Comcast went public with the proposal to trigger the regulatory timetable because timing will be a key factor. A Comcast spokesman said it would ask regulators in Brussels to look at the deal where it expects to avoid a lengthy investigation. Britain’s media minister has said he will give his verdict on Fox’s bid for Sky by June 14, giving Comcast a narrow window to get any takeover approval done.  “We would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50 percent of the Sky shares,” Roberts said. Disney’s Iger declined to comment when asked about the Comcast offer during a trip to Paris.  Murdoch had been edging towards a deal for Sky in recent weeks, eight years after he first tried to buy the company. Britain’s competition regulator said in January his planned takeover should be blocked unless a way was found to prevent the Australian-born power-broker from influencing Sky’s news operation. Critics, including many politicians, argue Murdoch wields too much influence through the Sun and Times newspapers, and in 2011 he closed the News of the World after its journalists admitted hacking phones to get scoops.   Seeking to prove it would not influence Sky News in the future, Fox last week promised to maintain and fund a fully independent Sky-branded news service for 10 years. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s ministers have appeared wary of approving Murdoch’s bid, repeatedly asking the independent regulator to intervene, and Comcast could face a smoother ride. A spokesman for May said the deal was a commercial matter.

1546,DIS,UPDATE 8-Comcast's $31 bln Sky bid crashes Murdoch and Disney show,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) has offered $31 billion for Sky Plc (SKYB.L), threatening a plan hatched by Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to seize control of Europe’s biggest pay-TV group. The world’s biggest entertainment company and owner of NBC and Universal Pictures said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain’s Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Murdoch’s Fox has agreed to pay for it. Bob Iger’s Disney has agreed to buy Sky from Fox, along with other assets, in a separate $52 billion follow-up deal. Comcast’s all-cash, unsolicited offer pits CEO Brian Roberts against Murdoch, the 86-year-old tycoon who helped to launch Sky and pioneered pay-TV in Britain. Iger is also a long-time rival after Comcast tried and failed to buy Disney in 2004. “Sky and Comcast are a perfect fit: we are both leaders in creating and distributing content,” Roberts said. Sky’s shares jumped more than 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, indicating that investors expect a bidding war. Shares of Comcast, Fox and Disney fell.  Comcast’s appearance in the already complex Sky drama could prompt Fox to make a higher offer or Disney to make its own direct bid for Sky. Fox remains committed to its cash offer announced in December, it said in a statement.     Media owners have been forced into increasingly aggressive deals after online groups Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) prompted many customers to ditch subscriptions.  Comcast bid $60 billion last year to clinch a deal with Fox, before losing out to Disney.  Sky, which provides sports programming, films and broadband to 23 million homes across Britain, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria, urged its investors to take no action since the approach did not represent a firm offer.  Murdoch’s Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been repeatedly held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain. The shares had been trading above the asking price since  Sky this month agreed to pay less than expected for Premier League soccer rights, likely boosting its future earnings and prompting investors to demand a higher offer. It also attracted the attention of U.S. hedge fund and activist investor Elliott Management Corp, which has built up a 2.5 percent stake in Sky in recent weeks.   Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch who holds 1 percent of Sky, said he expected a counter offer and speculated whether Disney could make a direct bid for Sky to avoid Fox’s regulatory problems. “Once you’re in a bidding war, it’s not about fair value, it’s about what do you think it’s worth,” Odey added.  Formed in 1990, Sky has built its business by offering leading content and technology. It snapped up Murdoch’s pay-TV groups across Europe in 2014 to offer a distribution platform that is now proving attractive to the big U.S. content owners.       Comcast said it had not yet engaged with Sky over the proposal and its finance director, Michael Cavanagh, declined to comment on whether it could lead to a renewed bid for Fox. Comcast will have to gain the support of Sky’s independent directors if it does not make a hostile bid because its chairman is Murdoch’s son James, who is also CEO of Fox. Comcast’s Roberts, the son of Ralph who founded the company in 1963, called Sky’s Deputy Chairman Martin Gilbert on Tuesday morning to notify him just before the offer statement was released, and called Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch shortly afterwards. Sky’s independent directors are expected to meet in the coming days to discuss the offer and the company said they were mindful of their duties to investors. Comcast went public with the proposal to trigger the regulatory timetable because timing will be a key factor. A Comcast spokesman said it would ask regulators in Brussels to look at the deal where it expects to avoid a lengthy investigation. Britain’s media minister has said he will give his verdict on Fox’s bid for Sky by June 14, giving Comcast a narrow window to get any takeover approval done.  “We would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50 percent of the Sky shares,” Roberts said. Disney’s Iger declined to comment when asked about the Comcast offer during a trip to Paris.  Murdoch had been edging towards a deal for Sky in recent weeks, eight years after he first tried to buy the company. Britain’s competition regulator said in January his planned takeover should be blocked unless a way was found to prevent the Australian-born power-broker from influencing Sky’s news operation. Critics, including many politicians, argue Murdoch wields too much influence through the Sun and Times newspapers, and in 2011 he closed the News of the World after its journalists admitted hacking phones to get scoops.   Seeking to prove it would not influence Sky News in the future, Fox last week promised to maintain and fund a fully independent Sky-branded news service for 10 years. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s ministers have appeared wary of approving Murdoch’s bid, repeatedly asking the independent regulator to intervene, and Comcast could face a smoother ride. A spokesman for May said the deal was a commercial matter.

1547,DIS,Disney toys return to McDonald's Happy Meals,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s USA and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Tuesday announced their first Happy Meal promotion partnership since ending a previous relationship in 2006, after the fast-food chain slimmed down its menu for kids. Their last exclusive, 10-year cross-promotional deal was reportedly worth $1 billion to Disney, according to the Los Angeles Times. McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) paid $100 million in royalties and conducted 11 promotions a year for Disney movies and television shows and opened restaurants inside its theme parks, the Times reported. The new multi-year, non-exclusive agreement will begin in June with promotions, including Disney movie-themed Happy Meal toys, for “Incredibles 2,” followed in the autumn by “Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2.” Executives from both companies declined to disclose the duration or value of the new deal.   A McDonald’s spokeswoman said the new pact does not include any agreement on restaurants in parks but added: “We will continue to explore ways to bring this alliance to life.” Disney introduced voluntary guidelines in 2006 that prohibited licensing of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters for foods that fail to meet minimum nutrition requirements.  That same year, an Institute of Medicine report said junk food marketing contributed to childhood obesity. McDonald’s since 2006 has taken numerous steps to make Happy Meals more nutritious and less fattening. Changes included adding fruit side options, cutting french fry portions and using menus to encourage consumers to order water rather than sugary soda. In June 2018, all Happy Meals offered on McDonald’s U.S. menu boards in the United States will contain 600 calories or less, 10 percent of calories from saturated fat and 10 percent of calories from added sugar. More than three-quarters will have 650 mg of sodium or less. Consultants and franchisees say Happy Meals account for roughly 15 percent of McDonald’s U.S. sales. The company does not break out product sales, but said family trips represent 30 percent of all visits to McDonald’s around the world.

1551,DIS,Britain's FTSE little changed as Sky soars on Comcast bid,"(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) * FTSE 100 down 0.1 pct * Sky soars 20.5 pct, ITV up 1 pct * Persimmon up 4.7 pct By Tom Pfeiffer LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Comcast’s bid for pay-TV group Sky and strong results from housebuilder Persimmon helped keep Britain’s FTSE 100 on an even keel on Tuesday, as investors digested the first public comments from new Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. Market reaction over Powell’s nod to “gradual” rate increases was muted. “Gradual” has been the operative word since the Fed began raising rates under Powell’s predecessor, Janet Yellen, in late 2015. Britain’s top share index closed down 0.1 percent, with Sky soaring 20.5 percent as investors priced in a possible bidding war for the company following Comcast’s surprise move. Rival broadcaster ITV rose 1 percent. The offer from the $184 billion U.S. media giant could scupper the plans of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox to buy out Sky and sell it to Walt Disney. That takeover has already been delayed by concerns for media plurality in Britain and whether Murdoch would be a “fit and proper” owner of such an important broadcaster. “Remember there is a $1.5 billion break Fox have to pay if the Fox/Disney deal breaks,” said from Neil Campling, Co-Head of the Global Thematic Group at Mirabaud Securities. “There is no way we can see that Fox will walk away given how advanced the regulatory clearance process is. This bid marks a floor not an end to this particular saga. Let the battle commence.” Not everyone agreed, with Liberum analysts doubting Fox or Disney would get into a bidding war. Investec said Disney may decide it has “enough to do in the U.S. versus a contested European bid process. Standard Chartered rose 1.2 percent after it joined rival UK banks in resuming dividend payments as profits soared, though weaker than expected revenue kept investor exuberance in check. Gains were seen among housebuilders after Persimmon announced a more than doubling of dividend payments, a 25 percent jump in profits and a 7 percent increase in reservation rates. Concerns over a downturn in the housing market have weighed on the industry in recent months, with a decline in mortgage approvals and the Bank of England raising benchmark interest rates. Persimmon was forced to scale back its management bonus plan this week after widespread criticism that it could have netted bosses more than 200 million pounds from share options. The cash return plan unveiled on Tuesday would make Persimmon the second-highest yielding housebuilding stock, said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. “Persimmon has gone a long way to calming at least one unhappy party by showering investors in the stock with a cash windfall of their own,” said Mould. Persimmon rose 4.7 percent, with Berkeley and Taylor Wimpey both up 0.8 percent. Troubled subprime lender Provident Financial saw its shares surge 70.4 percent to their highest in six months after the company said it would raise 331 million pounds via a rights issue. Three traders said the smaller-than-expected cash call had set off a short-squeeze as hedge funds attempt to cover their positions. The stock is the most shorted of any UK company.

At the European close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI was down 0.06 percent, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 0.3. percent and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.56 percent.  Concerns over rising inflation and higher bond yields sparked a global equity market sell-off at the beginning of February, but as bond yields have eased this has taken the pressure off equity indexes slightly. Shares in Sky jumped more than 20.5 percent on the back of Comcast’s (CMCSA.O) $31 billion offer, which could scupper Fox’s (FOXA.O) plan to buy out Sky and sell it to Walt Disney (DIS.N).  Sky shares were trading well above Comcast’s offer price, suggesting some investors expect Fox/Disney to come back with a higher offer.  “It has all the makings of being the most preferential bid for both shareholders and, importantly, regulators,” Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said.  “This could be a sign of things to come from the U.S. where maybe we’re looking at more international expansion from the U.S. into Europe which is a more straightforward target than perhaps Asia is,” Lawler said.  Europe’s media index .SXMP was the top-performing sector, up 1.2 percent at a one-month high while banks, which typically benefit from rising rates, added 0.5 percent on average.

1557,DIS,Comcast's bid for Sky could lure Disney in bidding war,"(Reuters) - U.S. cable company Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) proposal to buy Sky Plc (SKYB.L) for $31 billion has raised the specter of a potential bidding war between with Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty First Century Fox (FOXA.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).  Comcast, the owner of NBC, MSNBC and Universal Pictures, said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain’s Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Fox has agreed to pay for it. Murdoch’s Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent stake of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain. In December, Disney agreed to buy a number of Fox assets, including Fox’s stake in Sky, in a separate $52-billion deal. The next likely step is Comcast makes a firm offer, which would require the company to have its funding in place. Fox then could return with a higher offer.  Here are some of the scenarios on what may lie in store next for Sky: The most likely scenario, according to many analysts, is that Fox, with Disney’s blessing, raises its bid, potentially prompting a bidding war with Comcast. Fox has to at least match Comcast’s bid, but analysts estimate a final winning bid for Sky could go as high as 14 to 15 pounds per share. Sky’s shares jumped Tuesday 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, above Comcast’s offer. Under the terms of Fox’s deal with Disney, Disney cannot bid for Sky on it own, so any bid would come from Fox. However, Disney CEO Bob Iger has spoken about the importance of Sky to Disney’s plan to launch a global online streaming service. So it is likely that Disney would back Fox in bidding higher. Fox could choose not to challenge Comcast, which has said its offer is contingent on acquiring more than 50 percent of Sky. Comcast would prefer to own the whole of Sky, so Fox could use its 39 percent stake in the company as a bargaining chip. Once the its deal with Fox closes, Disney will own a majority stake in online streaming service Hulu in which Comcast is also a shareholder. Some investors have speculated that Disney could swap its controlling stake in Hulu as part of a deal for Comcast’s stake in Sky.  Comcast is currently bound as a passive investor of Hulu, meaning it cannot buy more shares in the company, under its consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice when it bought NBCUniversal. However, that consent decree expires in September.      There is an outside chance that Comcast could engage with Fox about buying the assets Disney is buying. Comcast had bid $60 billion before losing out to Disney, and sources have told Reuters that Comcast has been discussing bidding for the Fox assets again.  But such a deal would face significant regulatory hurdles in the U.S., which previously prompted Fox to snub Comcast’s bid. There is no reason to believe that Fox’s assessment of the regulatory risk will change.

1558,DIS,Film producer convicted in U.S. of investment fraud,"(Reuters) - A California movie producer who headed a boutique merchant bank has been convicted on charges he defrauded investors in hedge funds overseen by a New York-based investment adviser out of $26 million, prosecutors said on Friday. David Bergstein, who served as executive producer of the 2015 film “In the Heart of the Sea,” was found guilty by a federal jury in Manhattan on Thursday of charges including investment adviser fraud and securities fraud. Bergstein, a resident of Hidden Hills, California, who at the time of his arrest in 2016 was the chief executive of merchant banking firm Cyrano Group Inc, is scheduled to be sentenced on June 8.  A lawyer for Bergstein, 55, did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Bergstein was indicted in November 2016 along with Keith Wellner, the former general counsel of Weston Capital Asset Management, whose hedge fund investors were defrauded by the defendants, according to prosecutors. Wellner later pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors. Prosecutors said Bergstein and Wellner from 2011 to 2012 engaged in a scheme to conceal information from Weston investors about transactions involving their money, and transferred funds from one pool of Weston investors to make payments to another.  The indictment said they also misappropriated some investor funds for their own and others’ benefit. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in a statement said the fraud cost investors more than $26 million.     According to court papers, the case related to a probe of individuals including investment banker Jason Galanis involved in market manipulation for reinsurer Gerova Financial Group Ltd. Weston had done a deal with Gerova in 2010 that prosecutors said prompted the first of two schemes involving Bergstein and Wellner. Galanis in 2016 pleaded guilty to securities fraud in connection with the Gerova fraud. Albert Hallac, Weston’s founder, pleaded guilty in 2016 to charges that he schemed to defraud Weston investors.  Bergstein previously controlled several movie production companies including ThinkFilm and Capitol Films Development. He took an advisory role in Walt Disney Co’s 2010 sale of Miramax to an investor group that included a business partner. His movie credits include serving as an executive producer of 2004’s “The Whole Ten Yards” and 2007’s “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead.” In 2010, five of Bergstein’s film companies including Capitol Films and ThinkFilm were forced into bankruptcy at the urging of a group of creditors, court records showed.

The group, Protect Democracy Project Inc, filed suit in U.S. District Court in Washington seeking any records of communications about Fox’s Rupert Murdoch or the Fox-Disney transaction. The lawsuit also seeks “any related antitrust enforcement efforts by the DOJ, to find out whether the president or his administration is improperly interfering with the independence of the DOJ out of favoritism for a political ally.” The White House, the Justice Department and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fox declined to comment.

She said in December that Trump “thinks that, to use one of the president’s favorite words, that this could be a great thing for jobs.” Last month, a federal judge denied AT&T;’s request to see White House communications that might shed light on whether Trump pressured the Department of Justice to try to block the wireless carrier’s purchase of Time Warner.

1560,DIS,Disney taps Pitaro to lead ESPN through digital transition,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Monday named longtime executive James Pitaro the new president of its ESPN sports network, tapping him to navigate a rapid consumer shift from traditional television to online viewing. Pitaro, 48, joined Disney in 2010 and has run the consumer products and interactive group for the past two years. He replaces John Skipper, who resigned in December, citing substance addiction. ESPN, Disney’s most important cable network, remains a major profit source for the media giant but has been losing pay TV subscribers to cord cutting. Disney is trying to capture digital viewers with an upcoming streaming service called ESPN+, a $5-a-month subscription that will offer sports programing that is not shown on ESPN’s TV channels. “Jimmy forged his career at the intersection of technology, sports and media, and his vast experience and keen perspective will be invaluable in taking ESPN into the future,” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement. He added that Pitaro’s appointment “comes at a time for great opportunity for ESPN.” Pitaro also will serve as co-chair of Disney Media Networks and will report directly to Iger. “The appetite for quality sports content across platforms has never been greater, and I am looking forward to working with the talented ESPN team as we continue to redefine the future fan experience,” Pitaro said.  As head of consumer products, Pitaro ran the licensing of Disney-owned characters such as Mickey Mouse for toys, apparel and other merchandise. The consumer products business merged in 2015 with the interactive unit, which handles licensing for video games and oversees Disney websites. Pitaro joined Disney from Yahoo, where he served as head of media, including the company’s sports media properties. A new leader for the consumer products unit will be named later, Disney said.

1568,DIS,UPDATE 1-'Iron Man' director Favreau to create 'Star Wars' TV series,"(Adds background on other ‘Star Wars’ projects) LOS ANGELES, March 8 (Reuters) - Director Jon Favreau will write and produce a live-action “Star Wars” series for an upcoming Walt Disney Co streaming service, the company announced on Thursday, the latest in an expanding universe of new projects around the sci-fi franchise. Favreau, director of the “Iron Man” and “Jungle Book” movies, previously voiced a character in the animated series “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” and has a role in the May 2018 film “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” He is currently producing Disney’s remake of “The Lion King” movie. “If you told me at 11 years old that I would be getting to tell stories in the ‘Star Wars’ universe, I wouldn’t have believed you,” Favreau said in a statement. “I can’t wait to embark upon this exciting adventure.” Disney is developing the “Star Wars” series for a family-oriented, direct-to-consumer streaming service it plans to launch next year as the media and theme park company aims to capture online viewers who are leaving traditional television. The new series does not yet have a release date, Disney said. Last month, Disney announced another series of “Star Wars” feature films, this time to be written by the creators of HBO’s hit television show “Game of Thrones.” No details of the plot or release dates were given. Disney has also announced that Rian Johnson, director of 2017 film “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” would write and direct the first of a new trilogy of films in the franchise that will bring new characters and worlds not yet explored on screen. Disney bought Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4 billion and has already released two of three new movies based around characters originated by director George Lucas and brought to the screen in 1977. The third movie, “Star Wars: Episode IX” directed by J.J. Abrams, is scheduled for release in December 2019.

1573,DIS,Disney shareholders vote against CEO Iger's pay package,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) shareholders rejected an executive compensation plan that could reward Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger with up to $48.5 million a year over four years plus an equity grant worth about $100 million, in a non-binding vote on Thursday. The total compensation is tied to the closing of Disney’s planned $52.4 billion acquisition of film and TV assets from Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) and meeting performance targets. Fifty-two percent of shareholders voted against Disney’s compensation plan for Iger and other executives, the company said at its annual shareholder meeting in Houston. Forty-four percent cast ballots in favor and 4 percent abstained. “The board accepts the result of today’s non-binding vote and will take it under advisement for future CEO compensation,” Aylwin Lewis, chair of the board’s compensation committee, said in a statement. Iger’s continuation as chief executive is imperative in light of the planned Fox acquisition, Lewis said, noting that  total shareholder return has more than quadrupled over Iger’s tenure. Iger has been CEO since 2005 and added the title of chairman in 2012. Under the compensation plan, Iger would be paid up to $48.5 million in annual salary and bonuses if the Fox deal goes through, for each of the four years from 2018 to 2021. Iger was also awarded an equity grant that could be worth about $100 million in 2021, according to proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services, which urged investors to vote against the pay resolution. Seventy-five percent of the grant is based on Disney’s total shareholder returns compared with the S&P; 500 Index. Iger’s compensation reached $36.3 million in fiscal 2017. His contract was extended through 2021 when Disney announced the Fox deal in December. It is unusual for shareholders to vote against executive compensation. Just 1.2 percent of S&P; 500 companies failed to win majority support for their advisory pay resolutions in 2017, according to ISS Analytics.  ISS said the “substantial” payments to Iger tied to the Fox merger were “concerning.”  “While we acknowledge the need to retain critical leadership in anticipation of such a significant merger, the magnitude of the special equity grant ($100 million) is excessive,” ISS said in a January report. Lewis said the board had decided it was “imperative” for Iger to remain to oversee the integration of Fox businesses and that Fox also felt his continued leadership was “essential.” Total shareholder return has jumped 414 percent during Iger’s tenure, and Disney’s market capitalization has climbed to $156 billion from $46 billion, Lewis added. “We believe that the terms of Bob’s extension are in the best interests of our company and our shareholders, and essential to Disney’s ability to effectively maximize long-term value from this extraordinary acquisition,” Lewis said. The Fox acquisition is undergoing regulatory review that could take at least a year and has been complicated by Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) bid for one of the assets, Britain’s Sky PLC (SKYB.L). At the shareholder meeting, Iger said the deal would create “an extraordinary global entertainment company with a content and the platforms and the reach to meet the growing demands of consumers around the world.”  One shareholder asked Iger about his plans for Fox Searchlight, the arthouse film division that on Sunday won the Academy Award for best picture for “The Shape of Water.” “We have every intention, once the acquisition is approved, to maintain the business of Fox Searchlight,” Iger said.

Disney suffered a rare rebuke from its shareholders last week when a 52 percent majority opposed the compensation of Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote that could encourage the board to tweak the pay package.  ISS Analytics, the data arm of proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, estimated that if Iger hits maximum goals the package would make him the 12th-highest paid U.S. CEO on an annual basis in the past 10 years. Disney did not put a total value on Iger’s pay package.  Markus Hansen, senior research analyst at Vontobel Asset Management, which had 2.4 million Disney shares at year-end, praised Iger’s performance but said the firm voted against the compensation with the view the four-year pay package could be too easy to collect.  Under a contract extension through 2021 Iger could receive the full value of $100 million in stock awards tied to a deal to buy film and television assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) even if Disney’s total shareholder returns are middle-of-the-pack versus other big companies. While the metrics are not unusual, the feedback the board should take from the shareholder vote is that “the amount is large, so maybe a reduction in the amount and an increase in the performance targets” would be in order, Hansen said. Jacob Williams, corporate governance manager for pension overseer Florida State Board of Administration, said it voted its 2.2 million Disney shares against the compensation on similar concerns. It also had concerns about the lack of a clear succession plan after Iger leaves. “You hate to see a payout of that magnitude for short-term performance,” Williams said. He said however that a reorganization Disney announced on Wednesday had assuaged some succession concerns. To be sure, some investors would be pleased if Iger earned the top number. Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said he voted 150,000 shares for Disney’s  compensation plan because other media companies also pay well and Iger’s Fox deal looks smart. “If he succeeds, then you pay the guy,” Gerber said. Compensation consultant Brent Longnecker said the vote could spur the board to re-examine Iger’s performance goals, though he did not expect major change.  “I assume they won’t ignore it,” Longnecker said of the vote. Asked about the pay estimate and investor concerns, a Disney spokesman referred to comments after the vote from Aylwin Lewis, chair of the company’s compensation committee.  Lewis had said the board will take the vote result under advisement for future CEO compensation. Iger is “imperative” for Disney to keep as it absorbs Fox, Lewis said, with the CEO’s value illustrated by a total shareholder return of 414 percent during his tenure. Iger became CEO in 2005.  Iger made $36.3 million in the twelve months ended Sept. 30.  The analysis by ISS Analytics done at the request of Reuters showed the agreement could yield Iger roughly $423 million over four years if he hits all goals, or $274 million as the base case targeted by the board.   The analysis assumed that the Fox deal closes early next year and excluded elements such as stock appreciation. After the deal closes, Iger’s target annual pay would be about $55 million per year including salary and some stock awards. That amount could rise based on performance goals, ISS found.

1583,DIS,'Exhausted' Toys 'R' Us suppliers weigh options as huge retailer shuts,"CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Toys ‘R’ Us secured a $3.1 billion bankruptcy loan in September, toy makers were reassured they would be paid for goods delivered to the company as it tried to emerge from Chapter 11. Now those payments are at risk in a dramatic turn of events as the iconic toy retailer speeds toward U.S. liquidation. More than a dozen executives, specialists and lawyers interviewed by Reuters said they expected many small vendors to go bankrupt due to the disappearance of Toys ‘R’ Us and Babies ‘R’ Us in the United States. While the downfall of Toys ‘R’ Us came quickly in the United States, the Wayne, New Jersey-based retailer is still trying to find a buyer for its businesses in Canada, Europe and Asia. In the meantime, it wants to keep stores stocked to maintain customers and value.  “We have a $14-$15 million payment due that hasn’t been paid,” Isaac Larian, chief executive of Bratz dolls maker MGA Entertainment, said. “If I was a guessing man, I wouldn’t think I’d get all of it back.”  MGA, whose L.O.L. Surprise! toys were the industry’s top seller last year, stopped supplying goods to Toys ‘R’ Us on Wednesday, Larian said. Toys ‘R’ Us accounted for 15 percent of MGA’s annual sales. Larian spent Thursday and Friday on the phone with his lawyers and tending to a bid he and other vendors have made to acquire Toys ‘R’ Us’ Canadian operations.  “I have been working from 4 a.m. till midnight every day on this talking to other toy company executives, lawyers, bankers, other retailers,” Larian said. “I’m exhausted.”  At a Thursday hearing at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Virginia, vendor lawyers said they were receiving hourly calls from clients about hundreds of millions of dollars of claims. Whether or not they receive payment will depend on the outcome of the liquidation proceedings. For some, the writing for Toys ‘R’ Us had been on the wall. Marc Wagman, who heads insurance broker Gallagher’s (AJG.N) U.S. trade credit and political risk business, said credit insurers stopped covering Toys ‘R’ Us in the first and second quarters of 2017.  “Unfortunately, for a lot of these toy companies, Toys ‘R’ Us represented a means of testing consumer taste, a big retail opportunity and, for some, accounted for 20-40 percent of revenue. How that’s going to be replaced remains to be seen,” Wagman said. Toys ‘R’ Us, with $11 billion in annual revenue and shops up to 50,000 square feet (4,600 square meters) in size, was the last major specialty toy retailer, a loss not only for small, innovative toy makers that relied on it as a showcase, but also for brands such as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) that rolled out products with partner labels for blockbuster films like “Frozen” and some of the “Star Wars” series. “I have a short-term concern about the loss of business, the loss of one of my best partners over many, many decades,” said Joseph Shamie, president of Delta Children, one of the chain’s biggest vendors of children’s furniture, with roughly 470 employees.  He has been selling to Toys ‘R’ Us for more than 40 years, since he was 19. “I’m losing a lot of business and in very quick, unmanaged amount of time.” Shamie said his company will continue to supply products to Toys ‘R’ Us stores outside the United States, but that they are  “watching closely.” “I have to create opportunity so I can continue to employ the people I employ,” he said.  In a dire landscape that claimed 17 retail bankruptcies and more than 8,000 U.S. store closures last year alone, vendors are wising up on their customers’ financial health, paying close attention to online sales, new sources of revenue and, especially, liquidity. Among those that could pick up toy market share: big-box retailers Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N); chains such as JC Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), Kohls Corp (KSS.N) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O); drugstores like CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N); and discount outlets like Dollar General Corp (DG.N) or TJ Maxx (TJX.N). “We’ll work really hard with folks like Walmart and Target to see if they can take up volume by year-end,” said Jay Foreman, chief executive of Basic Fun!, which sells Cake Pop Cuties and Poopeez as well as classics like Lite-Brite.   Foreman expects a 10 percent revenue hit from the loss of Toys ‘R’ Us. He is also working with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which will become its second- or third-biggest account this year versus ninth in 2015, but said Amazon does not give minimum orders. “They’ll put it online and say ‘we’ll see how it does.’” Without mass distribution and a physical showcase, co-Chief Executive Nick Mowbray of toymaker Zuru Inc said innovations would become far riskier, leaving a dent in toy selection for customers.  “Doing business with a company in Chapter 11 was not supposed to be a ‘gotcha’ situation, but apparently in this case it was,” said Learning Resources Inc Chief Executive Rick Woldenberg. His Vernon Hills, Illinois, company is owed more than $1 million by Toys ‘R’ Us.  He said his company will no longer supply to Toys ‘R’ Us. “I don’t know how many times they think we can be punished.”  ",3172018,http://www.reuters.com/article/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-vendors/exhausted-toys-r-us-suppliers-weigh-options-as-huge-retailer-shuts-idUSL1N1QX2MO
1584,DIS,'Black Panther' Surpasses 'Tomb Raider' for Fifth Box Office Crown,"LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - Disney-Marvel’s “Black Panther” has maintained its momentum at the domestic box office, winning its fifth consecutive weekend with $27 million from 3,834 locations. Alicia Vikander’s “Tomb Raider” finished second in its opening weekend in line with expectations with $23.5 million from 3,854 sites for Warner Bros. and MGM. The videogame-based action adventure score a B grade from moviegoers in CinemaScore exit polls. Lionsgate-Roadside Attractions’ faith-based drama “I Can Only Imagine” outperformed forecasts with $17.1 million at 1,629 venues, notching the top per-screen average in the top 10 with $10,476. The studio plans to expand “I Can Only Imagine,” based on the story behind the hit song of the same name, to more than 2,000 sites next weekend. Disney’s second weekend of time-travel adventure “A Wrinkle in Time” followed in fourth with $16.6 million at 3,980 locations, lifting its 10-day total to $61.1 million. “Wrinkle,” directed by Ava DuVernay, declined by exactly half from its opening weekend. Fox’s launch of gay teen comedy-drama “Love, Simon” took fifth with $11.5 million at 2,402 venues, amid strong support from critics with a 91 percent “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes. “Simon,” starring Nick Robinson as a conflicted high schooler, notched an A+ CinemaScore with the audience, giving Fox execs hope for strong word of mouth and extended playability. Females comprised 58 percent of ticket buyers. “Black Panther” has become only the seventh title to pass the $600 million milestone at the North American box office, and is the second-fastest film to do so. It’s the fourth-highest fifth weekend of all time, and the first time a film has held the top spot for five weekends in a row since 2009’s “Avatar.” “Black Panther” has totaled a stunning $605.4 million in 31 days. It’s poised to pass “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” ($619.8 million) for sixth place and “The Avengers” ($623.4 million) for fifth place on the all-time domestic list by the end of next weekend. And it’s likely to eventually pass “Jurassic World” at $652.3 million for fourth place and “Titanic” at $659 million for third place. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” tops the list at $936 million followed by “Avatar” at $760 million. The weekend’s overall box office took in about $130 million, down 50 percent from the same weekend last year when Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” opened with $174.5 million. Thanks to “Black Panther,” the year-to-date box office is up 2 percent over the same period a year ago at $2.5 billion, according to comScore. “‘Black Panther’ continues to astonish as it shows incredible strength fully five weeks into its amazing run as it takes on another batch of notable newcomers and comes out on top,” said Paul Degarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore. “Black Panther” will face competition next weekend from Universal-Legendary’s launch of “Pacific Rim: Uprising” and Paramount’s animated comedy “Sherlock Gnomes.” Recent tracking for the “Pacific Rim” sequel has been in the $20 million to $30 million range while “Sherlock Gnomes” was in the $13 million to $18 million range. Warner Bros.’ fourth weekend of R-rated comedy “Game Night” took sixth place with $5.6 million at 2,686 locations, pushing its 24-day gross past $54 million. Sony’s sixth weekend of family comedy “Peter Rabbit” followed with $5.2 million at 2,725 sites for a 38-day total of $102.4 million. Aviron’s second weekend of horror sequel “Strangers: Prey at Night” finished eighth with $4.8 million at 2,464 venues. Fox’s third weekend of “Red Sparrow” followed in ninth with $4.5 million at 2,583 venues, pushing the Jennifer Lawrence thriller past $39 million. MGM’s third weekend of its “Death Wish” reboot rounded out the top 10 with $3.4 million at 2,676 locations to give the Bruce Willis vehicle $30 million in 17 days. Paramount’s fourth weekend of “Annihilation” and Sony’s 13th weekend of “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” tied for 11th place with $1.7 million. “Jumanji,” which won its third, fourth, fifth and seventh weekends, became the 30th film to cross the $400 million mark in domestic grosses.

1586,DIS,UPDATE 6-Murdoch offers to sell Sky News to Disney to win pay-TV prize,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch has stepped up the pressure on Britain to approve his $14.5 billion bid for Sky (SKYB.L) by offering to sell or legally separate Sky News, seeking to allay concerns about the 87-year-old mogul’s political influence. Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) said on Tuesday Sky News could be sold on to U.S. rival Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) or become a legally separate business within the Sky group.   Fox agreed in December 2016 to buy the 61 percent of European pay-TV group Sky it does not already own, but the deal has been repeatedly delayed by the UK government and regulators. Fox had already promised that Sky’s 24-hour news service would remain independent under the ultimate control of Murdoch, but critics, including some high-profile politicians, remain adamantly opposed due to Murdoch’s record of influence through owning the Sun and the Times newspapers.  The delay enabled U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp CMCSA.0 to gatecrash the deal in February by saying it would offer 12.50 pounds a share to buy Sky, compared with Fox’s 10.75 pounds - although it has not yet made a formal bid. As the Sky deal remained in regulatory limbo, Fox separately agreed to sell a string of assets, including its 39 percent stake in Sky, to Disney, potentially taking Murdoch out of the Sky equation. Fox said on Tuesday its new concessions went beyond the steps that Britain’s media regulator Ofcom said would mitigate concerns about Murdoch’s influence.  The company, however, needs to persuade another regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and the government.  “We have worked diligently with the CMA throughout its extensive review,” it said. “In fact, we believe that the enhanced firewall remedies we proposed to safeguard the editorial independence of Sky News addressed comprehensively and constructively the CMA’s provisional concerns.” Fox said it could legally separate Sky News within the wider Sky group, so it would operate independently with guaranteed funding for 15 years. Alternatively, it said Disney had expressed an interest in acquiring the 24-hour news channel, whether or not Disney’s proposed acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox went ahead. Fox senior vice president Gerson Zweifach said the solutions  addressed all concerns about the transaction.  “We look forward to concluding this acquisition - finally - in a timely and expeditious manner,” he said. Sky shares were up 0.9 percent at 13.09 pounds at 0906 GMT, above both the agreed offer from Fox and the proposed bid by Comcast. Analysts at Liberum said Fox’s latest concessions should be enough to secure approval. They also said that two factors pointed to Fox coming back with a revised bid to match Comcast. First, Fox must have received approval from Disney to offer the concession, they said, and second, Sky said its independent directors remained focused on maximizing value for shareholders. Separate news on Tuesday that Sky Italia had settled its long-running fight with Mediaset in the Italian pay-TV market also made Sky more valuable, they added. A group of high-profile British lawmakers, including former Labour party leader Ed Miliband, called last month for Murdoch to be blocked from buying Sky, despite the promises Fox had already made to ensure the independence of Sky News. The four said the promises did not go far enough, given Murdoch’s record of influence. The group could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. Fox said on Tuesday a group of politicians was seeking to influence the CMA, adding they were making “a number of unsupported and fanciful assertions”.

1587,DIS,Breakingviews - Disney and Fox open door to higher Sky bid,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sky investors on Tuesday received a mini Easter egg. Walt Disney is ready to buy the pay-TV group’s news channel to smooth the regulatory process for merger partner Twenty-First Century Fox. This signal of Disney’s commitment to owning the UK broadcaster boosts the odds of a bidding war with rival Comcast. Rupert Murdoch’s Fox has been stuck in regulatory limbo since late 2016, when the 39 percent shareholder in Sky launched an 11.7 billion pound ($16.5 billion) offer for the rest of the company. Britain’s antitrust regulator said in January the deal could give Murdoch undue influence given his existing interests in the Sun and Times newspapers. But it also acknowledged that Fox’s $52.4 billion December all-stock tie-up with Disney, which would make the “Star Wars” producer Sky’s ultimate owner, offered ways around the problem. Fox has come up with two new solutions that were published on Tuesday by the regulator. First, Sky News could be established as a distinct, “ring-fenced” company inside Sky, with its own board and guaranteed funding for 15 years. That’s a slightly stronger version of an idea which media watchdog Ofcom, the first regulator to review the deal, said would “mitigate” concerns. Alternatively, Disney may pledge to buy Sky News. That would remove the political and regulatory heat from Fox’s bid for the rest of Sky. Unlike Murdoch, Disney has no meaningful news business in Britain and would therefore pose less of a concern to regulators.  The U.S. company’s willingness to countenance such a deal has more symbolic than financial significance. Loss-making Sky News is so small that its results aren’t broken out in the parent’s annual report. But the statement of intent is important given cable group Comcast lodged a possible offer in February that beat Fox’s bid for Sky by 16 percent. Disney boss Bob Iger is unlikely to be interested in the small, unprofitable news channel on its own. His readiness to buy Sky News therefore signals a clear commitment to owning Sky. That was previously uncertain since Disney has argued it could buy Murdoch’s 39 percent without making a full bid, because owning Sky wasn’t necessarily the main motivation of the wider tie-up between Fox and Disney. That argument looks disingenuous after Tuesday’s move. There’s a growing chance that Murdoch and Iger will try to outbid Comcast to get what they want.",4032018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-disney-and-fox-open-door-to-higher-sky-bid-idUSKCN1HA23K
1588,DIS,Murdoch's Fox could sell Sky News to Disney to appease UK regulator,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch has stepped up the pressure on Britain to approve his $14.5 billion bid for Sky (SKYB.L) by offering to sell or legally separate Sky News, seeking to allay concerns about the 87-year-old mogul’s political influence. Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) said on Tuesday Sky News could be sold on to U.S. rival Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) or become a legally separate business within the Sky group.   Fox agreed in December 2016 to buy the 61 percent of European pay-TV group Sky it does not already own, but the deal has been repeatedly delayed by the UK government and regulators. Fox had already promised that Sky’s 24-hour news service would remain independent under the ultimate control of Murdoch, but critics, including some high-profile politicians, remain adamantly opposed due to Murdoch’s record of influence through owning the Sun and the Times newspapers.  The delay enabled U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp CMCSA.0 to gatecrash the deal in February by saying it would offer 12.50 pounds a share to buy Sky, compared with Fox’s 10.75 pounds - although it has not yet made a formal bid. As the Sky deal remained in regulatory limbo, Fox separately agreed to sell a string of assets, including its 39 percent stake in Sky, to Disney, potentially taking Murdoch out of the Sky equation. Fox said on Tuesday its new concessions went beyond the steps that Britain’s media regulator Ofcom said would mitigate concerns about Murdoch’s influence.  The company, however, needs to persuade another regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and the government.  “We have worked diligently with the CMA throughout its extensive review,” it said. “In fact, we believe that the enhanced firewall remedies we proposed to safeguard the editorial independence of Sky News addressed comprehensively and constructively the CMA’s provisional concerns.” Fox said it could legally separate Sky News within the wider Sky group, so it would operate independently with guaranteed funding for 15 years. Alternatively, it said Disney had expressed an interest in acquiring the 24-hour news channel, whether or not Disney’s proposed acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox went ahead. Fox senior vice president Gerson Zweifach said the solutions  addressed all concerns about the transaction.  “We look forward to concluding this acquisition - finally - in a timely and expeditious manner,” he said. Sky shares were up 0.9 percent at 13.09 pounds at 0906 GMT, above both the agreed offer from Fox and the proposed bid by Comcast. Analysts at Liberum said Fox’s latest concessions should be enough to secure approval. They also said that two factors pointed to Fox coming back with a revised bid to match Comcast. First, Fox must have received approval from Disney to offer the concession, they said, and second, Sky said its independent directors remained focused on maximizing value for shareholders. Separate news on Tuesday that Sky Italia had settled its long-running fight with Mediaset in the Italian pay-TV market also made Sky more valuable, they added. A group of high-profile British lawmakers, including former Labour party leader Ed Miliband, called last month for Murdoch to be blocked from buying Sky, despite the promises Fox had already made to ensure the independence of Sky News. The four said the promises did not go far enough, given Murdoch’s record of influence. The group could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. Fox said on Tuesday a group of politicians was seeking to influence the CMA, adding they were making “a number of unsupported and fanciful assertions”.

1590,DIS,UPDATE 2-Viacom asks CBS to raise its bid by $2.8 billion -sources,"(Reuters) - Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) has asked CBS Corp (CBS.N) to sweeten its merger bid by about $2.8 billion, or almost a quarter more than CBS’s offer, three people familiar with the matter said, indicating the wide gap in the U.S. media companies’ price expectations. National Amusements Inc, the Redstone family company that controls CBS and Viacom, has pushed them to negotiate a merger by forming independent board committees. Viacom’s request shows how the companies have yet to make progress in their talks. In a letter to CBS last week, Viacom asked for 0.68 CBS shares for each Viacom class B share, the sources said. CBS had offered 0.55 of its shares for each Viacom class B share, sources have said. CBS is now considering its next steps in the deal negotiations, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because Viacom’s request is confidential.  CBS and Viacom declined to comment. Shares of CBS were trading around $52.67 on Monday morning, while Viacom shares were trading around $30.75.  At CBS’s proposed share exchange ratio of 0.55, Viacom would be valued at $11.9 billion, below its current market capitalization of $12.7 billion. Viacom’s counterproposal values the company at $14.7 billion. Viacom shares have risen by about a third since early November on speculation of new efforts to merge CBS with Viacom, after the previous round of negotiations in 2016 ended unsuccessfully. In its letter to CBS last week, Viacom also asked for its Chief Executive Robert Bakish to be president and chief operating officer of the combined company, a demand supported by National Amusements, according to the sources.  CBS has asked for its chief operating officer, Joseph Ianniello, to have that role instead, the sources said.  Both CBS and Viacom agree that CBS CEO Les Moonves should lead the combined company, according to the sources. Viacom said on Monday it would report quarterly earnings on April 25, a departure from its standard practice of reporting earnings in the first week of May alongside CBS, which is scheduled to report its earnings on May 3. Viacom decided to push forward its earnings announcement date because it believes it has strong numbers to unveil that will boost its negotiating leverage in the merger talks with CBS, two of the sources said.  The merger would combine CBS’ television network, local TV stations and Showtime cable network with Viacom’s cable networks, including MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, as well as its Paramount Pictures film studio. The pressure on the media sector to consolidate has increased following AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) and Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) recent deal to buy some Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) assets for $52.4 billion. Combined, CBS and Viacom would have more leverage to negotiate prices for their programming with U.S. cable and satellite companies, which face a decline in subscribers amid fierce competition from media streaming companies like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). CBS investors may be worried that the work to combine the two companies could slow CBS’ growth trajectory, said John Janedis, an analyst at Jefferies.

1592,DIS,Hedge fund Paulson & Co takes stake in Viacom amid turnaround,"April 11 (Reuters) - Paulson & Co, the hedge fund firm led by billionaire investor John Paulson, has taken a stake in Viacom Inc as the U.S. media company has started to turn around its business amid a challenging landscape, Paulson told Reuters in an interview. Over the past few months, Paulson has bought 3.7 million nonvoting shares of Viacom as the company, which for years has suffered from declining advertising and viewership, has begun to show results of its turnaround plan under Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish, Paulson said on Tuesday. “We are very impressed with the turnaround,” Paulson said. “It is starting to look attractive.” Paulson said he began buying shares of Viacom before the company began re-exploring a merger with CBS Corp, which he does not own. CBS and Viacom, both of which are controlled by Shari and Sumner Redstone, began exploring a merger in February. The two companies are negotiating the price of a deal, which is expected to be all-stock, and who will run the combined company, sources have told Reuters. A merger of CBS, which owns its broadcast network and premier channel Showtime, with Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures and such networks as Comedy Central and MTV, makes sense because it would give the company scale at a time when many media companies are merging, Paulson said. Walt Disney Co, for example, is in the middle of acquiring a number of 21st Century Fox’s assets. Paulson said he has been impressed not only with the fact that, under Bakish, Viacom has renewed carriage deals with traditional cable companies like Charter Communications Inc , but that Bakish is focused on gaining subscribers through deals with online streaming services and mobile deals. “We are just at the beginning of this,” he said. Viacom recently announced a deal with Telefónica SA in Latin America to give its mobile subscribers access to its networks and shows. Paulson also noted that Paramount Pictures, under its new head, Jim Gianopulos, has started to show a stronger slate. The studio’s horror movie “The Quiet Place,” which opened last weekend, topped box-office sales, bringing in $50 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada. Paulson estimates that a combined CBS/Viacom could realize more than $1 billion in synergies, adding that he hopes the two companies can agree on a management structure that includes CBS CEO Leslie Moonves and Bakish. “When it’s time for Les to retire, Bob is more than capable,” he said.

1593,DIS,ESPN+ streaming service launches Disney's digital drive,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Thursday debuted its new ESPN+ digital subscription service, the first consumer offering in the traditional media company’s push to become a leader in streaming entertainment. The service will carry more than 10,000 live sporting events that are not shown on television, as well as exclusive on-demand programing such as a new documentary about controversial college basketball coach Bobby Knight.  ESPN and other cable networks have been losing pay TV subscribers as audiences rapidly migrate to online services such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). Disney is trying to adapt to the switch by developing its own streaming offerings. ESPN+ may lose money for “some number of years, not huge” as the company works to lure enough subscribers to cover programing investments, said Kevin Mayer, chairman of Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international unit.  During a briefing at ESPN’s studio in downtown Los Angeles, Mayer told reporters he expects the service will become profitable and will provide valuable insight for other Disney streaming services.  “This is strategic for us,” Mayer said. “This is a multi-year effort. It’s going to take some time to assess how it has performed.” ESPN+ is designed for fanatics who want more sports programing, and for people who cannot find their favorite teams or sports on TV, Disney executives said. The latter includes fans of cricket, rugby, Canadian football or Ivy League sports.  The service is offered as an add-on inside a newly designed ESPN mobile app or through ESPN.com. It costs $4.99 a month, or $49.99 per year. “It is an opportunity for us to serve sports fans in new ways, and in ways no one else can,” ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro said. Programing includes one live Major League Baseball game each day during the regular season, starting with the San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants on Thursday. Customers also will see Major League Soccer games, college sports from 20 U.S. conferences, and boxing and Grand Slam tennis matches that do not air on TV. A daily National Hockey League matchup will be added starting with the 2018-2019 season. ESPN+ does not include Monday Night Football or National Basketball Association games that are shown on ESPN’s TV channels. Those are reserved for subscribers of pay TV packages, who can stream the live TV lineup through the ESPN app. The redesigned app allows customers to watch up to four streams simultaneously on one screen.

1594,DIS,"Disney must offer to buy all of Sky, Britain's takeover regulator rules","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s takeover regulator said Walt Disney (DIS.N) must offer to buy all of Sky if it acquires Twenty-First Century Fox’s 39 percent stake and if Rupert Murdoch’s Fox is prevented from purchasing all of the European pay-TV company itself. Fox (FOXA.O) agreed an offer to buy all of Sky (SKYB.L) 17 months ago but is still waiting regulatory approval, while Disney has agreed to buy Fox assets, including its stake in Sky, in a separate deal subject to its own regulatory clearance. The ruling means that if Fox’s bid to buy Sky is blocked by the government in June because of Murdoch’s media influence, Disney will have to step in to make the same offer to shareholders if and when it becomes the owner of Fox’s assets. Disney had said it should not be required to make a bid for the whole of Sky in line with Fox’s existing offer if it bought the Fox assets, but Britain’s Takeover Panel ruled on Thursday that it must match Fox’s 10.75 pounds-a-share price. Analysts had said Disney wanted a special dispensation to give it more flexibility on whether or when it would bid for the rest of Sky if it only bought the 39 percent stake from Fox.  The Takeover Panel, however, said it considered that  securing control of Sky might reasonably be considered to be a significant purpose of Disney’s acquiring control of Fox, and it must make an offer within 28 days of buying the Fox assets. The Panel’s ruling will not stand if Fox has acquired 100 percent of Sky by the time Disney buys the Fox assets, or if Comcast Corp or any other third party has acquired a stake of more than 50 percent in Sky.  U.S. cable company Comcast (CMCSA.O) said on Feb. 27 that it was considering making an offer for Sky. Sky said it noted the Takeover Panel’s ruling, and it advised shareholders to take no further action at this time. Twenty-First Century Fox said that under the ruling, any mandatory offer by Disney would only be required after Disney’s acquisition of Fox is completed, which Fox currently expects to occur after completion of Fox’s offer for Sky.  “21CF (Fox) remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky announced on 15th December 2016,” it said.  The offer was supported by revised remedies it had offered to Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, it added.

The joint filing by Disney and Fox, which outlines the timeline of their negotiations, offers the most detailed insight yet into Fox’s thinking, as it goes head-to-head against Comcast, a U.S. cable operator, in its bid to acquire European pay-TV company Sky Plc (SKYB.L), in which Fox holds a 39 percent stake. Comcast announced in February it was working on a $31 billion bid that would top Fox’s deal for Sky. It has not made a new attempt to bid for the Fox assets after the Disney deal, so investors are keen for information on the hurdles that prevented an agreement between Fox and Comcast. The filing does not mention Comcast by name, but refers to it as Party B. Another bidder for the Fox assets, U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), is referred to as Party A. Verizon and Comcast representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Comcast on Nov. 14 offered to acquire most of Fox’s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, the filings said. Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox’s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the documents show.  In the filing, Disney and Fox said the ongoing antitrust scrutiny of U.S. telecommunications provider AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) planned merger with media conglomerate Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) heightened concerns about potential regulatory hurdles to Comcast’s bid. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued AT&T; and Time Warner to thwart their deal, and the case is in court. The companies added that, unlike Disney, Comcast declined to offer a reverse deal termination fee, which would compensate Fox in the event that regulators stymied a deal. Disney offered a reverse termination fee of $2.5 billion.  The companies also said that Fox saw Disney’s stock as more valuable than Comcast’s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure. Comcast’s proposal, on the other hand, would reduce the compensation offered to Fox shareholders in the event that asset sales were required to reassure antitrust regulators, increasing the potential risk to Fox shareholders, the filing said.  Verizon’s bid was rejected because it offered to acquire Fox at market value, without a meaningful premium, according to the filing.

1602,DIS,Sky reports strong quarter before bid battle steps up,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sky (SKYB.L), the pay-TV group at the center of a takeover battle between Fox, Disney and Comcast, reported a strong third quarter on Thursday, underlining its appeal to rival U.S. entertainment groups who want to expand in Europe. Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said the British company was “well placed for the future” regardless of which company emerged as its ultimate owner.   Sky added 38,000 customers, taking its customer base to nearly 23 million homes.  Core earnings for the nine months to end-March were up 10 percent to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) on like-for-like revenue up 5 percent to 10.1 billion pounds. The latest battle to buy Sky started in December 2016, when Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O), the owner of 39 percent of the company, agreed to buy the rest. Since then, the deal has been stuck in regulatory purgatory,  a tortuous process due to end in June. But if Fox receives clearance it is unlikely to end up as the long-term owner of Sky. Murdoch agreed to sell most of Fox to Disney (DIS.N) for $52.4 billion in December, including its stake in Sky.  Fox spurned a higher offer from U.S. cable giant Comcast (CMCSA.O) over concerns about regulatory risk and its stock value, a filing showed on Wednesday. After losing that battle, Comcast said it was considering making a 12.50 pounds a share offer for Sky, valuing the group at $31 billion, and trumping the 10.75 pounds offer agreed by Fox.  Darroch said on Thursday there had been some interaction between Sky and Comcast in terms of the regulatory process.  “They haven’t yet come forward with a full offer, as and when they do that, if they do, then we will obviously come back and talk a bit more in detail then,” he told reporters. Fox/Disney and Comcast want to buy Sky to scale up against online groups Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Darroch said Sky was continuing to improve its own products and services to ensure it provided the content entertainment its customers wanted. It will launch streaming service Spotify (SPOT.N) on its flagship Sky Q platform next week, and will offer Netflix (NFLX.O) in a Sky package in Britain before the end of the year, he said. “Customers can look forward to an even broader choice of entertainment through our pioneering new partnerships with Netflix and Spotify, together with our new Premier League deal which secures the UK rights until 2022,” he said. Sky shares were trading at 13.05 pounds at 1036 GMT, down 0.3 percent. ",4192018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-results/sky-reports-strong-quarter-before-bid-battle-steps-up-idUSKBN1HQ0NQ

Murdoch agreed to sell most of Fox to Disney (DIS.N) for $52.4 billion in December, including its stake in Sky.  Fox spurned a higher offer from U.S. cable giant Comcast (CMCSA.O) over concerns about regulatory risk and its stock value, a filing showed on Wednesday. After losing that battle, Comcast said it was considering making a 12.50 pounds a share offer for Sky, valuing the group at $31 billion, and trumping the 10.75 pounds offer agreed by Fox.  Darroch said on Thursday there had been some interaction between Sky and Comcast in terms of the regulatory process.  “They haven’t yet come forward with a full offer, as and when they do that, if they do, then we will obviously come back and talk a bit more in detail then,” he told reporters. Fox/Disney and Comcast want to buy Sky to scale up against online groups Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Darroch said Sky was continuing to improve its own products and services to ensure it provided the content entertainment its customers wanted. It will launch streaming service Spotify (SPOT.N) on its flagship Sky Q platform next week, and will offer Netflix (NFLX.O) in a Sky package in Britain before the end of the year, he said. “Customers can look forward to an even broader choice of entertainment through our pioneering new partnerships with Netflix and Spotify, together with our new Premier League deal which secures the UK rights until 2022,” he said. Sky shares were trading at 13.05 pounds at 1036 GMT, down 0.3 percent.

1606,DIS,"Fox chose Disney over Comcast on regulatory, stock fears: filing","(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), which agreed in December to sell most of its assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) for $52.4 billion, had previously rejected a bid from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) over concerns about the regulatory risks and its stock value, a regulatory filing on Wednesday showed. The joint filing by Disney and Fox, which outlines the timeline of their negotiations, offers the most detailed insight yet into Fox’s thinking, as it goes head-to-head against Comcast, a U.S. cable operator, in its bid to acquire European pay-TV company Sky Plc (SKYB.L), in which Fox holds a 39 percent stake. Comcast announced in February it was working on a $31 billion bid that would top Fox’s deal for Sky. It has not made a new attempt to bid for the Fox assets after the Disney deal, so investors are keen for information on the hurdles that prevented an agreement between Fox and Comcast. The filing does not mention Comcast by name, but refers to it as Party B. Another bidder for the Fox assets, U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), is referred to as Party A. Verizon and Comcast representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Comcast on Nov. 14 offered to acquire most of Fox’s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, the filings said. Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox’s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the documents show.  In the filing, Disney and Fox said the ongoing antitrust scrutiny of U.S. telecommunications provider AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) planned merger with media conglomerate Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) heightened concerns about potential regulatory hurdles to Comcast’s bid. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued AT&T; and Time Warner to thwart their deal, and the case is in court. The companies added that, unlike Disney, Comcast declined to offer a reverse deal termination fee, which would compensate Fox in the event that regulators stymied a deal. Disney offered a reverse termination fee of $2.5 billion.  The companies also said that Fox saw Disney’s stock as more valuable than Comcast’s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure. Comcast’s proposal, on the other hand, would reduce the compensation offered to Fox shareholders in the event that asset sales were required to reassure antitrust regulators, increasing the potential risk to Fox shareholders, the filing said.  Verizon’s bid was rejected because it offered to acquire Fox at market value, without a meaningful premium, according to the filing.

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. - Rupert Murdoch sold most of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to Disney in December for $52.4 billion, spurning a proposal from Comcast Corp, that was 16 percent higher on a per-share basis, in part because Comcast refused to offer protections in the event of regulatory rejection. nyti.ms/2J8RWYV - Time Warner Inc Chief Executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, vigorously defended his company's $85.4 billion merger with AT&T; on Wednesday, saying the deal was necessary to confront ""tectonic changes"" in entertainment caused by internet competitors like Netflix Inc and Amazon.    nyti.ms/2JZlKbG - Advertisers are the lifeblood of Facebook Inc, and the vast, personal reach of the social network has been a marketer's dream. But now, some companies are taking a harder look at how they work with it and hunting for skeletons in their own data closets. nyti.ms/2Hc8keF - U.S. President Donald Trump declared on Wednesday that he would scrap a planned summit meeting with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, or even walk out of the session while it was underway, if his diplomatic overture was not heading toward success. nyti.ms/2qOy8T9 (Compiled by Bengaluru newsroom)",4192018,http://www.reuters.com/article/press-digest-nyt/press-digest-new-york-times-business-news-april-19-idUSL3N1RW2T5
1608,DIS,Breakingviews - Sky upside depends on Disney-Fox irrationality,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Deals rarely look as good on paper as they do in a chief executive’s head. Comcast’s $31 billion offer for UK satellite broadcaster Sky just about passes financial muster. Investors expecting a higher bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox, with backing from Walt Disney boss Bob Iger, are betting on the triumph of sentiment over spreadsheet. The cable giant run by Brian Roberts on Wednesday firmed up its offer of 12.50 pounds per Sky share, beating Murdoch’s December 2016 bid by 16 percent. The move endangers the mogul’s plan to sell Fox – including Sky – to Disney for $52.4 billion in stock. It also dashes any hopes that Iger and Murdoch could persuade Roberts to back away by offering him an alternative asset, like U.S. streaming service Hulu. Assuming British regulators clear both bids, it’s a straightforward battle on price. Comcast has the stronger hand. On Wednesday the $155 billion company said it had identified $300 million of annual pre-tax cost savings and a further $200 million of gains from combining Sky’s TV shows and movies with Comcast’s NBCUniversal library. Generously add those to consensus estimates for Sky’s operating profit in 2020, tax the lot at 18 percent, and the return on invested capital is almost 7 percent. That’s just about in line with cable groups’ cost of capital, according to New York University estimates. It’s hard to see how Murdoch and Iger could justify going higher. The House of Mouse has less overlap with Sky’s core business as a distributor of video entertainment. Second, Comcast has greater firepower: its leverage is low for a cable group and its EBITDA this year will be greater than Disney and Fox combined, according to Eikon estimates. Besides, Comcast’s dual-class stock means Roberts does not have to fret about shareholders blocking his plans. Iger might conclude that Sky is crucial to his European expansion. Murdoch, meanwhile, will be reluctant to part with the company he spent decades building, and might want to hang on to Fox’s 39 percent stake in case the wider Disney tie-up collapses. Nevertheless, investors who pushed Sky shares up 4 percent to 13.57 pounds on Wednesday are wagering on Disney and Fox disregarding financial sense.",4252018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-sky-upside-depends-on-disney-fox-irrationality-idUSKBN1HW248
1609,DIS,'Star Wars Resistance' is Disney's latest small-screen spinoff,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An animated “Star Wars” children’s television series that draws visual inspiration from Japanese anime will debut later this year on the Disney Channel, Walt Disney Co and its “Star Wars” subsidiary Lucasfilm said on Thursday. “Star Wars Resistance” is the latest in a string of numerous new or upcoming film and television “Star Wars” ventures for Disney, which paid $4 billion in 2012 for the blockbuster science-fiction saga created by George Lucas. The adventure series centers on Kazuda Xiono, a young pilot recruited by the Resistance and sent on a top-secret mission to spy on the growing threat of the First Order military dictatorship. Disney did not announce a start date for “Star Wars Resistance” but said it would premiere in the fall. “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” the next live-action installment in the franchise, will debut at the Cannes Film Festival on May 15 and open in U.S. theaters on May 25. Last month, Disney announced it had struck a deal with “Iron Man” director Jon Favreau to write and produce a live-action “Star Wars” series for its upcoming streaming service. “Star Wars Resistance” will feature “Star Wars” actors Oscar Isaac and Gwendoline Christie voicing their characters - Poe Dameron and Captain Phasma, respectively - from the live-action “Star Wars” films. “The idea for ‘Star Wars Resistance’ came out of my interest in World War II aircraft and fighter pilots,” series creator Dave Filoni said in a statement.  “There’s a long history of high-speed racing in ‘Star Wars,’ and I think we’ve captured that sense of excitement in an anime-inspired style, which is something the entire team has been wanting to do for a long time,” Filoni added. The announcement of the series comes as an earlier animated series, “Star Wars Rebels,” finished a three-and-a-half-year run on the Disney XD cable network last month.

1611,DIS,Disney plays up local ties in China amid trade standoff,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shanghai Disneyland should be viewed as a local company in China, Walt Disney (DIS.N) said on Thursday, shrugging off concerns that U.S.-China trade tensions could affect visitor numbers or import costs for the $5.5 billion theme park.  Bob Weis, President of Walt Disney Imagineering, addressed the trade issue at the opening of Toy Story Land, a new extension modeled after the Disney-Pixar film series and the park’s first major expansion since it opened in 2016. Shanghai Disneyland is a joint venture with state-owned Shendi Group, which has a 57 percent stake. Shendi is a consortium controlled by Shanghai Media Group, hotelier Jin Jiang International, supermarket-to-department store operator Bailian Group and developer Lujiazui Development Group.  “The way to think about us in terms of projects like this is that we are a local company,” Weis said, when asked whether the company’s costs could be impacted if retaliatory tariffs threatened by Beijing against U.S. goods were put in place.  “In the case of this you can look at ... toys or airplanes, everything here, they are built and made in China. We are really local in where we source things,” he told reporters. Weis, who oversaw construction of the park, said he was not worried about attendance falling due to the trade tensions. He said the park would keep expanding and come up with new ideas to attract visitors.  “Expansion is definitely in our planning,” Weis said.  Disney has emphasized its Chinese links since the park opened. Shanghai Disneyland’s attractions include a Chinese-style Wandering Moon tea house, a Chinese Zodiac-themed garden and a Tarzan musical featuring Chinese acrobats. However, since early April companies in the United States and China have worried about a potential trade war between the two countries which could see tariffs slapped on their products and raise costs.  China-based U.S. executives have expressed concerns that American brands could see a backlash similar to that faced by South Korea last year after Seoul deployed a U.S.-made missile defense system despite Beijing’s strong objections.

He declined to speak about individual companies except for engineering firm The Weir Group (WEIR.L), which the fund praised this month for being willing to “challenge conventional thinking on remuneration” by being simple and transparent. “The Weir Group has led by example to a different degree than others and were very clear in the way they were doing it. We wanted to highlight them,” said Slyngstad.  “We have not outlined any other companies that we would want to do the same for in advance.

It is also against board members being elected as a group as it cannot then have a say on individual members. This season it therefore voted against the reelections of the boards of both Sweden’s Alfa Laval (ALFA.ST) and Atlas Copco (ATCOa.ST).

Stocks were lower for most part of the morning before sharply paring losses after CNN reported Trump was expected to impose sanctions on Iran, but may also allow for “a grace period that may offer the deal’s proponents an opening to negotiate.” But those moves evaporated just as quickly after the New York Times reported that Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron the United States was going to pull out. Macron’s office later said Trump had not given the French leader any indication of his decision. The announcement will be made at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). “We’re getting conflicting reports about the Iran deal. The market will struggle until we get clarity on this,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. Crude prices  were down more than 2 percent, easing from steeper losses after the CNN report. The S&P; energy sector, which led a rally on Wall Street in the past two days, was down 0.7 percent. “There’s just a lot of uncertainty right now with respect to what the announcement will be and what the effect on oil prices could be as a result, so people are trading every which way,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. At 12:36 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 77.12 points, or 0.32 percent, at 24,280.20, the S&P; 500 was down 8.27 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,664.36 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 18.18 points, or 0.25 percent, at 7,247.03. The CBOE Volatility Index rose 0.28 points to 15.03, gaining for the first time in four sessions. The S&P; financial sector was up 0.6 percent, and along with the industrials group, was the only other gainer among the 11 major S&P; sectors. Citigroup rose 3.4 percent after activist investor ValueAct invested $1.2 billion in the bank, citing its low risk and reliable revenue. Comcast fell 4.8 percent after Reuters reported the cable operator is preparing to make an all-cash offer for media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox has agreed to sell to Disney for $52 billion. Disney, which is due to report its results after markets close, was down 1.4 percent. Fox’s shares rose 0.1 percent. The Dow Jones Transport Index jumped 0.8 percent on boost from logistics company Expeditors, which jumped 7.8 percent after reporting strong first-quarter earnings.

1625,DIS,Exclusive: Comcast prepares all-cash bid to gate-crash Disney-Fox deal - sources,"(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp is asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it can make an all-cash offer for the media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has agreed to sell to Walt Disney Co for $52 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts only plans to proceed with the bid if a federal judge allows AT&T; Inc’s planned $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc to proceed, the sources said. The U.S. Department of Justice has opposed the AT&T-Time; Warner deal over antitrust concerns, and a decision from U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon is expected in June. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger clinched an all-stock deal with Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch in December to acquire Fox’s film, television and international businesses, giving the world’s largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. Comcast, owner of NBC and Universal Pictures, has also made a 22 billion pound ($30 billion) offer to acquire the 61 percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky Plc that Fox does not already own. In doing so, it topped an earlier offer for the entirety of Sky by Fox. Last November, Comcast offered to acquire most of Fox’s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, or $64 billion, a regulatory filing showed last month. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox’s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the filing shows. Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. In the regulatory filing, Disney and Fox cited regulatory hurdles as reasons to reject Comcast’s bid, even though they did not reference it by name. The exact value of Comcast’s new bid for the Fox assets is not yet clear, although the $60 billion in new financing indicates it is seeking significant firepower to outbid Disney. Comcast already has a $30 billion bridge loan to finance its Sky offer. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Comcast, Fox and Disney declined to comment. Fox shares rose 5.13 percent to $39.99 on the news in after-hours trading in New York on Monday. Comcast shares were down 1.5 percent to $31.90, while Disney shares were down 0.5 percent to $102.00.  Murdoch, who owns close to a 17 percent stake in Fox and holds about 40 percent of the voting power, prefers to be paid in stock rather than cash for the Fox assets, because this makes the transaction non-taxable for shareholders, sources have said. It is not clear how receptive he would be to an all-cash offer. Last month’s regulatory filing also showed that Fox viewed Disney’s stock as more valuable than Comcast’s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure. Comcast’s stock has dropped since then, from around $38 to about $32 now, giving the company a market capitalization of $149 billion.  Disney has committed to share buybacks as a way of returning cash to Fox shareholders. As a result, Comcast sees an opening in being disruptive to the deal by making an all-cash bid, according to the sources.  In its deal with Disney, Fox agreed to separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly listed company that it will spin off to its shareholders.

1626,DIS,"Comcast races to secure regulatory, political approval for Sky deal","LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. group Comcast stepped up its push to buy European pay-TV group Sky on Tuesday, seeking regulatory and political approval even as it maneuvers for a broader deal with bid rival, Rupert Murdoch’s Fox. Comcast, the world’s biggest entertainment company, set out its plans to keep Sky’s news output independent and fully funded for 10 years to address any political concerns that a takeover could damage Britain’s news market.  Its formal notification to the European Commission of its intention to buy Sky also put it on a similar regulatory timetable to Fox, despite entering the race 14 months later, with verdicts on both bids due next month.  Comcast is keen to prove to Sky’s shareholders that it will face fewer regulatory hurdles in its $30 billion pursuit of Sky than Murdoch’s Fox which has faced repeated delays in its bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own.  On Monday the bid battle, which already involves three of the world’s biggest media companies after Disney agreed to buy some Fox assets including Sky, took a further twist when Reuters reported that Comcast is seeking to disrupt the broader Fox-Disney deal by preparing its own counter bid.  According to three people familiar with the matter, Comcast is asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it can make an all-cash offer for the media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has agreed to sell to Walt Disney Co. “As these big groups look to fight off the threat from the likes of Netflix and Amazon then scale becomes more and more important and you need scale and distribution,” Numis media analyst Paul Richards said.  “You can see why the Fox assets are so important and Sky is rolled in with that.” Sky is a British-based European pay-TV group that offers services in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.  It agreed to be sold to its founder and 39-percent owner Fox in December 2016 but regulators and politicians have repeatedly intervened over concerns that the newspaper-owning Murdoch will have too much influence in Britain.  With Fox focused on getting approval, Comcast made its own shock bid for Sky in February, promising an easier approval process and a higher offer. It made its bid formal last month, and on Monday it notified the European Commission and will get an initial verdict on June 15.  On Tuesday it said it had agreed legally binding guarantees with Sky to fund its award-winning news output and to create a board to oversee its independence.  “The Sky News Binding Commitments will constitute legally binding commitments on Comcast and Sky which will be enforceable by the Sky News Board,” Comcast said in a statement.  Murdoch’s Fox has set out its own undertakings to protect the funding and independence of Sky News and is waiting to hear from Britain’s media secretary on whether Fox should be allowed to buy Sky. The government will give its verdict on that offer on June 13.

1629,DIS,UPDATE 2-Twenty-First Century Fox revenue beats as cable sees highest earnings ever,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O), the media and entertainment company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts’ estimate on Wednesday, as higher fees from cable and satellite distributors drove cable business earnings to a record high. Fox, which agreed to sell the bulk of its film and TV assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) last year in a $52.4 billion deal, expects to ask for shareholder approval of the transaction this summer, Lachlan Murdoch, executive chair, said on an analyst call.  Murdoch declined to comment on reports that Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) is preparing an all-cash rival offer for the assets, which Reuters first reported Monday   Fox expects to receive UK regulatory approval on its bid to buy the remaining stake it does not already own of European pay-TV provider (SKYB.L) in the next couple of months, James Murdoch, chief executive officer of Twenty-First Century Fox, said on the call. Comcast this week notified regulators of its plans to bid for Sky. “Given Comcast’s bid for Sky, we are considering our options,” James Murdoch said, adding that the company would  make an announcement in “due course.”      Revenue from Fox’s cable division, which houses the Fox News and FX channels among others, rose 9.8 percent to $4.42 billion, accounting for more than half of total revenue in the fiscal third quarter ended March 31. That beat analysts’ average estimate of $4.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Despite the departure of former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly amid sexual misconduct allegations last spring, prime-time ratings of Fox News have held up when looking at April compared to the year-ago period, Lachlan Murdoch said.  “That’s a real testament to the strength of the brand and obviously the strength of the talent on air,” he said. The company reported revenue of $3.51 billion in affiliate fees, a rise of 11 percent from a year earlier. Revenue at its television unit, which houses Fox Broadcasting, was $1.15 billion, down 32 percent from the year-ago quarter, which included the Super Bowl, and missed analysts’ estimate of $1.28 billion. Total revenue fell 2 percent to $7.42 billion, but beat estimates of $7.4 billion. Net income attributable to shareholders increased to $858 million, or 46 cents per share, from $799 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, Fox earned 49 cents per share, missing analysts’ estimate of 53 cents per share. Fox shares were flat in after-hours trading.

1630,DIS,AIG shareholders approve $43 million pay package for CEO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said shareholders approved a $43.1 million pay package for 2017 for Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault during the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. A nonbinding resolution to endorse the executive compensation passed with a majority of votes cast, Chairman Doug Steenland announced, adding that further details would be released later in the day.  Influential proxy advisory firms International Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis had advised shareholders to reject the resolution, saying the pay package did not align with AIG’s performance. AIG’s stock has dropped 13 percent since Duperreault took charge of the company last May. The company’s pay arrangements include $24.2 million for former CEO Peter Hancock, who stepped down last year under pressure, with a $5 million cash award “for his service through the transition” to Duperreault, according to its annual proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March. It is unusual for both advisory firms to recommend voting against pay measures for the same company. ISS recommended votes against pay only about 12 percent of the time for companies listed on the broad-based Russell 3000 stock index, an ISS spokesman said. Glass Lewis gave AIG’s compensation package a letter grade of “F.” “Overall, the company paid significantly more than its peers, but performed significantly worse than its peers,” the report said. ISS said one-time awards to Duperreault when he joined the company, including a $12 million cash bonus, were not tied to performance. AIG declined to comment on the proxy recommendations. AIG’s board compensation committee “believes this award properly motivates Mr. Duperreault to create sustainable, profitable growth for AIG, aligning his interests with those of our shareholders,” the proxy filing states. Some investors have said they would approve of Duperreault’s pay so long as he performs. Duperreault has vowed to help the company expand and boost revenue. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase a focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits.  AIG is preparing to finalize its acquisition of reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N). But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line. In March, AIG said it paid Duperreault $43.1 million last year, according to the proxy filing. Excluding one-time components, Duperreault earned $14.9 million. That figure was similar to the $15.3 million paid to MetLife Inc (MET.N) CEO and Chairman Steven Kandarian in 2016, and less than the $27.1 million paid in 2017 to John Strangfeld, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N), according to proxy filings by those companies.

1634,DIS,AIG shareholders set to vote on pay package for new CEO,"NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc faces an uphill climb to convince shareholders to approve a $43.1 million pay package for Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault during the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. Two influential proxy advisory firms, International Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, have advised shareholders to reject the package in the non-binding vote, saying it did not align with AIG’s performance. AIG’s stock has dropped 13 percent since Duperreault took charge of the company last May. The company’s pay arrangements include $24.2 million for former CEO Peter Hancock, who stepped down last year under pressure, with a $5 million cash award “for his service through the transition” to Duperreault, according to the company’s annual proxy filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March. It is unusual for both advisory firms to recommend voting against pay measures for the same company. ISS recommends votes against pay only about 12 percent of the time for companies listed on the broad-based Russell 3000 stock index, an ISS spokesman said. That could sway shareholders, corporate governance experts said. “It seems that investors do react to these recommendations,” Jill Brown, a management professor at Waltham, Massachusetts-based Bentley University, said in an email. Brown pointed to a March non-binding vote by Walt Disney Co shareholders, who rejected a $48.5 million executive compensation plan for Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger by a 52 percent majority. Both proxy advisory firms had advised against Iger’s package. Glass Lewis gave AIG’s package a letter grade of “F.” “Overall, the company paid significantly more than its peers, but performed significantly worse than its peers,” the report said. ISS said one-time awards to Duperreault when he joined the company, including a $12 million cash bonus, were not tied to performance. AIG declined to comment on the proxy recommendations. AIG’s board compensation committee “believes this award properly motivates Mr. Duperreault to create sustainable, profitable growth for AIG, aligning his interests with those of our shareholders,” the proxy filing states. Some investors have previously said they would approve of Duperreault’s pay so long as he performs. Duperreault has vowed to help the company expand and boost revenue. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG’s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits. AIG is also preparing to finalize its acquisition of reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd. But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line. In March, AIG said it paid Duperreault $43.1 million last year, according to the proxy filing. Excluding one-time components, Duperreault earned $14.9 million. That figure was similar to the $15.3 million paid to MetLife Inc CEO and Chairman Steven Kandarian in 2016, and less than the $27.1 million paid in 2017 to John Strangfeld, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial Inc, according to proxy filings by those companies. AIG shares have closed as high as $66.06 on Aug. 3, compared with $61.82 on the first trading day following his mid-May appointment. The stock ended down 0.4 percent on Tuesday at $53.08.
