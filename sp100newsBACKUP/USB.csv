1,USB,First Horizon talking to regulators to use excess,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - First Horizon National Corp’s (FHN.N) second-quarter profit topped Wall Street estimates, boosted by improving credit quality in its markets, and the lender said it was working with regulators to deploy its excess capital.  Large regional banks like PNC Financial (PNC.N), BB&T (BBT.N), US Bancorp (USB.N) and others have boosted their dividends after receiving regulators’ blessings, in a sign that the U.S. banking environment is improving.  “I don’t know how long that (capital deployment) will take. But that is something that we intend to work on and we will continue to work through that process,” Chief Executive Bryan Jordan said on a call with analysts.  Jordan, however, did not give a firm guideline on when the capital deployment would occur.  “First Horizon needs to redeploy around $500 million in excess capital,” Anthony Davis, analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co, said.  However, any capital deployment will likely come with more clarity on the bank’s private-label buyback liabilities.  First Horizon has been under cloud due to the possibility that it may have to buy back some of the mortgages it securitized and sold to private investors, before it sold off its mortgage business to Metlife Inc’s (MET.N) banking unit.  “We are still waiting for development in rep and warranty issues. I don’t think they need to enter into settlement like Bank of America (BAC.N) or other larger banks though,” analyst Anthony Davis said.  Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said it expects to take more than $20 billion in charges after settling toxic loan cases with mortgage bond investors.  As of the second quarter, First Horizon said it had not received any requests for private label repurchases.  Despite the overhang of possible mortgage putbacks, First Horizon, the largest bank in Tennessee, set aside just $1 million to cover future bad loans, signaling an improved credit outlook in its South-Eastern U.S. markets.  First Horizon, which counts hedge fund RS Investments, T Rowe Price Associates, Marisco Capital and Vanguard Group Inc among its top investors, also said its net charge-offs fell more than 50 percent to $66 million.  Second-quarter net income available to common shareholders was $42.6 million, or 16 cents a share, beating analysts’ estimates of a profit of 11 cents a share.  The company’s non-performing assets fell to $747.9 million from $899.8 million.  First Horizon’s shares were up 3 percent at $9.75 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They touched a high of $10.18 earlier in the session.  ",7152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-firsthorizon/first-horizon-talking-to-regulators-to-use-excess-idUSTRE76E1XE20110715

6,USB,"CORRECTED - WRAPUP 2-US regional banks make more loans, margins narrow"," (Corrects second bullet point to say that Wall Street’s estimate for US Bancorp, on average, was 53 cents a share, not 45 cents)   * PNC reported EPS of $1.67 beat estimates of $1.46   * US Bancorp’s EPS of $0.60 beat estimates of $0.53   * Loan loss provisions decline  (Adds details on net interest margins, interest income, M&T Bank and Northern Trust results, byline)   By Joe Rauch   CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 20 (Reuters) - Narrower loan margins may cut into the profits of three large U.S. regional banks even as they make more loans.   PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) and US Bancorp (USB.N) — the fifth and sixth largest U.S. banks — beat analyst expectations by setting aside less money to cover bad loans for the quarter that ended on June 30.   But the results showed that interest margins, which are the returns on loans after paying deposit interest, are tightening.   The results highlight the difficulties regional banks face as they emerge from the credit crisis. On the positive side, loan losses are declining.   But loan demand is growing only slightly. And investor fears about the economy are pushing down longer-term bond yields, cutting into returns for lenders.   PNC’s loan loss provision fell 66 percent to $280 million from $823 million a year ago. The decline contributed to the Pittsburgh-based bank’s net income of $912 million, or $1.67 per share, up from $803 million, or $1.47 per share, a year ago.   Minneapolis-based US Bancorp reported net income of $1.2 billion, or 60 cents per share, up from $766 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier.   Also on Wednesday, regional lender M&T Bank Corp (MTB.N) reported net income of $322 million, or $2.42 per share, up from $188 million, or $1.46 per share, a year ago.   Regional banks are not alone in coping with low rates. Northern Trust reported a 24 percent drop in net income, which the Chicago-based company blamed on lower interest rates. [ID:N1E76J05F]   For many regional banks, growing loan books in the second quarter have not translated to similar increases in interest income.   At M&T Bank, loans rose 15 percent to $58.5 billion from $51 billion a year ago, helped by the acquisition of Wilmington Trust, but net interest income rose only 3 percent to $586 million from $482 million.   The slower increase was due in part to a decline in the interest margin to 3.75 percent from 3.84 percent.   At PNC and US Bancorp, margins were squeezed in the second quarter. PNC’s interest margin fell to 3.39 percent from 4.35 percent a year earlier.   PNC Chief Financial Officer Richard Johnson said during a conference call with analysts that a decline in interest-bearing assets pushed the margin down, despite an increase in interest-free deposits.   The bank projects net interest income will remain stable for the rest of 2011, despite planning to have more loans on the books at the end of the year.   The bank earned $2.2 billion in interest income, down from $2.4 billion a year earlier.   Meanwhile, US Bancorp grew its total loans 4 percent during the quarter to $198 billion from $191 billion a year ago, but saw its own margin shrink to 3.67 percent from 3.9 percent.   The new loans helped push net interest income to $2.54 billion from $2.4 billion a year earlier.   (Reporting by Joe Rauch.

7,USB,"Regional banks make more loans, margins narrow","CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Narrower loan margins may cut into the profits of three large U.S. regional banks in the future even as they make more loans.  PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) and US Bancorp (USB.N) — the fifth and sixth largest U.S. banks — beat analyst expectations by setting aside less money to cover bad loans for the quarter that ended on June 30.  But the results showed a tightening of interest margins — the difference between the interest rates that banks pay on deposits and  the rates they receive for lending it.  The results highlight the difficulties regional banks face as they emerge from the credit crisis. On the positive side, loan losses are declining.  But loan demand is growing only slightly. And investor fears about the economy are pushing down longer-term bond yields, cutting into returns for lenders.  “Every day that rates stay low is a day banks’ margins are going to be under pressure,” said Jefferson Harralson, a bank analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.  Pittsburgh-based PNC posted second-quarter net income of $912 million, or $1.67 per share, up from $803 million, or $1.47 per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected $1.46 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Minneapolis-based US Bancorp reported net income of $1.2 billion, or 60 cents per share, up from $766 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 53 cents a share.  Also on Wednesday, regional lender M&T Bank Corp (MTB.N) reported net income of $322 million, or $2.42 per share, up from $188 million, or $1.46 per share, a year ago.  Regional banks are not alone in coping with low rates. Northern Trust reported a 24 percent drop in net income, which the Chicago-based company blamed on lower interest rates.

The slower increase was due in part to a decline in the interest margin to 3.75 percent from 3.84 percent.  Meanwhile, US Bancorp increased its total loans 4 percent during the quarter to $198 billion from $191 billion a year ago, but its own margin shrank to 3.67 percent from 3.9 percent.  The new loans helped push net interest income to $2.54 billion from $2.4 billion a year earlier.  PNC’s interest margin fell to 3.39 percent from 4.35 percent a year earlier.  PNC Chief Financial Officer Richard Johnson said during a conference call with analysts that a decline in interest-bearing assets pushed the margin down, despite an increase in interest-free deposits.  Consumers have flooded banks with deposits, and are willing to accept low interest or no interest, as long as their money will be kept safe.  But potential returns from loans are falling. Existing, higher margin loans are maturing for many lenders, and banks are heavily competing for new loans now, Harralson said.  “You’re seeing aggressive pricing,” he said.  PNC, for example, noted it added $2 billion in new commercial loans during the quarter, while real estate and other lending declined.  Analysts said the decline in margin is likely to persist for several quarters as banks’ higher-yielding, but now risky, real estate loans are replaced by lower-yielding commercial loans.  “You’ll continue to see some modest bleed in the margin, but I think you’ll still see interest income growth,” said Marty Mosby, bank analyst with Guggenheim Securities.

11,USB,"Obama, CEOs talk markets, global economy woes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global financial upheaval was on the agenda on Friday when President Barack Obama met with top executives from the U.S. business community, the White House said.  Chief executives from Johnson & Johnson, Wells Fargo & Co, U.S. Bank, Xerox Corp, BlackRock Inc, Silver Lake Partners, American Express and U.S. Steel all met with Obama to discuss the economy and the president’s plans to create jobs.  Obama held his latest in a series of talks with Big Business against the backdrop of a euro zone debt crisis that has hit financial markets worldwide, adding to investor anxiety in the aftermath of last week’s U.S. credit downgrade.  Before Friday’s session which included major players from the financial sector, the White House said market turmoil and economic troubles around the world would be among the issues discussed, along with the U.S. economy and job creation.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest denied the meeting was called in reaction to market and global concerns but said: “They’ll certainly talk about these issues, about the market reaction here.”  The meeting came at the end of a volatile week. U.S. stocks rose on Friday as mildly upbeat retail sales data offset a closely watched barometer showing U.S. consumer sentiment at its lowest point in more than three decades.  European stock markets also gained despite continued concern about French banks’ exposure to European debt woes.  Critics have complained that Obama has failed to reassure Americans as markets whipsawed this week, in one of the most dramatic periods in the stock market since he took office amid the financial crisis in January 2009.  He said on Thursday that Europe’s debt troubles were among the global challenges weighing on the struggling U.S. recovery, but the White House said the administration remained confident in European leaders’ ability to handle the situation.  Obama’s hopes for re-election in 2012 will likely hinge on his success in lowering unemployment, currently pinned above 9 percent, boosting sluggish growth and restoring confidence lost from the Standard & Poor’s downgrade and fractious debt talks.  White House meetings with executives have become almost routine as Obama has courted business leaders while seeking to cast himself as more of a centrist.

15,USB,Solar company Evergreen files for bankruptcy,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. solar company Evergreen Solar Inc filed for bankruptcy on Monday, its once cutting-edge technology falling victim to competition from cheaper Chinese rivals and solar subsidy cuts in Europe.  The Chapter 11 filing by a company once seen at the forefront of U.S. renewable energy technology came after a two-year struggle to stave off competition from Asia. The increasingly crowded market forced Evergreen to close its much-touted but short-lived Massachusetts factory and relocate manufacturing to China, and resulted in the virtual disappearance of its once-lofty stock market value.  “How is the U.S. going to compete in manufacturing in general when manufacturers in China have access to numerous advantages?” said GTM Research analyst Brett Prior. “It costs $1.10 per watt in China to make a solar panel. That same exact process costs $1.80 here in the U.S. That’s a 60 percent difference, and that’s too big.”  Evergreen’s solar wafer technology was a favorite of investors in 2007 and 2008 because it used dramatically less of the industry’s key pricey raw material, polysilicon. At the time, however, silicon prices were 10 times what they are today, making that advantage less meaningful as silicon prices gradually retreated from their highs.  But the Marlboro, Massachusetts, company’s troubles worsened markedly in recent months as top solar markets Italy and Germany pared back subsidies, increasing global supplies of solar panels and sending prices into a tailspin.  The price of solar wafers, Evergreen’s primary product, has dropped 35 percent this year, for instance.  The recent turmoil in the solar market has hurt the profits of even the industry’s top manufacturers, including U.S. heavyweights First Solar Inc and SunPower Corp and low-cost Chinese players including JA Solar Holdings Co Ltd.  “If the lowest cost producers can’t make money, then those with a higher cost of labor are going to fail,” said John Segrich, portfolio manager of the Gabelli SRI Green Fund, adding that he expects to see the demise of more solar companies, including U.S. thin film maker Energy Conversion Devices Inc and Germany’s Q-Cells SE.  “The manufacturing cost is just too high,” Segrich said.  In April, Evergreen warned investors that it had been hurt by the downturn in demand and might need to raise cash sooner than expected. It failed then, however to reach a deal with bondholders to restructure its debt, a development that would have made it easier to raise capital.  According to documents filed on Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, Evergreen has now reached a deal in which the holders of its secured notes will bid the $165 million they are owed for the company. The so-called stalking horse bid is subject to higher offers, and the company and its bankers will market Evergreen to potential buyers. Delaware’s bankruptcy court must approve any deal.  “It’s very unclear what the intellectual property is worth,” said Prior. “It’s only worth something if someone is willing to invest in it and take it to the next stage.”  Rival wafer makers such as Asian players Renesola, GCL and LDK Solar or Norway’s Renewable Energy Corp could buy the company’s technology at a firesale price, Prior said.  Holders of Evergreen’s unsecured notes may get nothing unless the company is sold for more than $165 million. As in many bankruptcies, shareholders are likely to be wiped out.  In court records, the company listed assets of $424.5 million and debts of $485.6 million.  Evergreen’s top creditors include U.S. Bancorp; its Chinese manufacturing partner, Jiawei Solar; Massachusetts economic development organization MassDevelopment; Lazard Capital Marketing; and Korea’s OCI Co Ltd.  Shareholders with more than 5 percent voting stakes in the company include Aristeia Capital LLC, OCI and Vanguard Group.  Evergreen’s stock closed at 18 cents Monday on the Nasdaq.

17,USB,"With a 'Bah, humbug!', NY judge tosses foreclosure"," * Brooklyn man saved from foreclosure   * Judge: Phone call with officer of defunct lender a fraud   By Jessica Dye and Jonathan Stempel   NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Shouting “Bah, humbug!,” a New York judge threw out the planned foreclosure against a Brooklyn man based on an alleged fraudulent Christmas Eve phone call confirming the paperwork was in place to take his home away.   The judge, Arthur Schack, said US Bancorp’s (USB.N) US Bank NA unit cannot foreclose on the Brooklyn home of Dario Trujillo, who faced foreclosure proceedings begun in July 2008 by Downey Savings and Loan. Downey failed four months later and was bought by Minneapolis-based US Bancorp.   Schack is a state Supreme Court justice in Brooklyn known for criticizing perceived abuses in mortgage servicing.   He was angered after lawyer Margaret Carucci said in a sworn affidavit that a Downey officer on Dec. 24, 2010 claimed to have personally reviewed and could vouch for the accuracy of the paperwork underlying Trujillo’s foreclosure — although Downey had long ceased to exist.   “Ms. Carucci affirmed under the penalties of perjury that she communicated on Christmas Eve 2010 with the officer of a defunct financial institution,” Schack wrote. “This is a deceptive trick and fraud upon the court. It cannot be tolerated. This Christmas Eve conduct, in the words of Ebenezer Scrooge, is ‘Bah, humbug!’”   Schack directed Carucci and her law firm at the time, Westbury, New York-based Druckman Law Group, to explain at a hearing on Sept. 12 why they should not be sanctioned.   Nicholas Perciballi, a lawyer for the Druckman firm, had no comment on the ruling. Carucci is no longer employed by the firm and efforts to reach her were unsuccessful. US Bancorp had no immediate comment. A lawyer for Trujillo could not immediately be located.   The sworn affirmation is a new requirement in all New York foreclosure cases, instituted last year to cut back on foreclosure fraud and abuse.   But during oral argument, Schack discovered the mortgage and note for Trujillo’s property had been assigned to U.S. Bank NA, part of U.S. Bancorp.   Schack has previously come down hard on errors in residential foreclosure cases.   Last July, for example, he threw out a foreclosure action over improper documentation and threatened to sanction the head of HSBC Bank USA, part of HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L), for “false statements” in a case against another Brooklyn homeowner.   The case is Downey Savings and Loan Association FA v. Trujillo et al, New York State Supreme Court, Kings County, No. 22260/2008.

19,USB,Setback for Sprint in motion against TerreStar," Aug 22 (Reuters) - A bankruptcy court has denied Sprint Nextel Corp’s motion for a partial summary judgement in a proceeding against bankrupt mobile satellite network operator TerreStar Networks Inc , U.S. Bancorp and others.	   Sprint, in its motion, had filed a claim of $104 million against TerreStar, saying the amount was the network operator’s share of the cost that Sprint incurred in acquiring bandwidth that TerreStar now uses.	   Sprint also alleged that a lien on TerreStar’s license assets held by the 15 percent senior unsecured noteholders be declared invalid or subordinate to Sprint’s claims. U.S. Bancorp is the indenture trustee and collateral agent for the senior notes.	   Judge Sean Lane, in his opinion stated that the it is the role of the bankruptcy judge and not any other body to determine the priority of Sprint’s claim versus other parties’ claims.	   TerreStar holds the license for the S-Band spectrum, which was previously used for other purposes and was made available to TerreStar only after that it was cleared by Sprint.	   TerreStar, which tried to market the first satellite smartphone, was coveted for its roughly 20 megahertz of spectrum. It filed for bankruptcy last October, with more than $1 billion in debt. 	   In July, a judge approved TerreStar Networks Inc’s  proposed $1.375 billion sale to Dish Network Corp  , pushing the satellite communications company a step closer to emerging from bankruptcy. 	   Sprint, which is the third largest wireless company in the United States, has seen a fall in its subscribers and shrinking operating profit margins. Its second-quarter results were below Wall Street estimates. 	   The case is Re: Sprint Nextel Corp Et al vs. U.S. Bank National Association et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-05461.

22,USB,BofA sued over $1.75 billion Countrywide mortgage pool,"NEW YORK/CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp was sued by the trustee of a $1.75 billion mortgage pool, which seeks to force the bank to buy back the underlying loans because of alleged misrepresentations in how they were made.  The lawsuit by the banking unit of US Bancorp is the latest of a slew of litigation to recover investor losses tied to risky mortgage loans issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008.  In a complaint filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, U.S. Bank said Countrywide, which issued the 4,484 loans in the HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-10, materially breached its obligations by systemically misrepresenting the quality of its underwriting and loan documentation.  Soon after the loans were sold to the trust, they “began to become delinquent and default at a startling rate,” the complaint said. Out of a sample of 786 of the loans, 520, or 66 percent, breached one or more representations, it said.  U.S. Bank said it demanded that Bank of America fix the breaches or buy back the loans as it had agreed to do, but that it has refused and offered no reason for this refusal.  The lawsuit demands that the bank repurchase all the loans in the pool, or at least those it knows have problems and are hurting investors in the trust.  Bank of America was not immediately available for comment.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank paid $2.5 billion to buy Countrywide, but writedowns and legal costs have pushed the estimated cost of that purchase to more than $30 billion.  Last fall, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the bank would fight repurchase claims by investors, calling the process “hand-to-hand combat.”  In 2011, however, he has agreed to large settlements with mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as billionaire Wilbur Ross’ bond insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd.

Within five years, the bank says Chase Private Client could generate a $1 billion a year in pretax income — if it can attract one in five branch customers to use their services.  “At my old job, I used to come to work every day focused on acquiring new clients. At Chase, we have 2 million affluent customers — they’re already here,” Chase Wealth Management Chief Executive Barry Sommers said in an interview.  Sommers until last year was CEO of JPMorgan Securities, a full-service brokerage formerly known as Bear Stearns Private Client Services. He is among a handful of Bear executives still in JPMorgan’s leadership ranks three years after the big bank snapped up the troubled investment bank in 2008.  The bank began testing Chase Private Client in 2007, staffing retail branches with bankers and investment managers focused on offering red carpet treatment to the wealthy consumer and small business banking customers.  These customers also gain access to more elite JPMorgan portfolio management services. Sommers says the unit will refer customers needing trust, estate planning and other more complex transactions to other parts of the bank.  “We want to offer our banking customers something we haven’t in the past, helping us deepen our relationships with them,” Sommers said.  Chase Private Client expects to have more than 400 bankers and 150 financial advisers, he said.  The program also may solve a challenge for JPMorgan, whose retail bank dominance in New York and other U.S. cities means the company cannot expand through takeovers or new branches without running afoul of competition regulators.  So in order to keep profits rising, Chase, like its rivals, want to a bigger share of its customer’s wallet.  Sommers says Chase has 1.8 million consumer bank customers with between half a million to $5 million in assets. This group represents just 10 percent of Chase retail bank customers but holds $1.8 trillion, or 70 percent of their combined wealth.  The venture is another bite at the wealth management apple for JPMorgan Chase, where private bankers and private-wealth client advisers oversee $776 billion for multimillionaires.  The bank also runs JPMorgan Securities, a full-service brokerage boutique with more than 400 advisers, and Chase Investment Services, whose 3,000 brokers sell stocks, funds and RIAs to a broader population of less wealthy bank customers.  Lots of banks offer brokerage services through their branches. A recent report by consulting firm Cerulli Associates said U.S. banks last year employed nearly 15,000 brokers overseeing $483 billion in client assets.  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) last year launched Merrill Edge, an online brokerage targeting people with $100,000 to invest. Merrill Edge will double its ranks to 1,000 advisers this year and seek business from BofA branch clients.  Chase’s rich customers, to be sure, have dozens of brokerages, banks and boutiques competing to sell them investment advice. Chase is counting on its rich depositors choosing to do more business with a bank they already know.  “These are people with a strong relationship with the branch, who want some private banking capabilities,” he said.

28,USB,FDIC to get first bank wills by next summer,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The largest banks and financial firms will submit blueprints for their dismantling in the event of failure to U.S. regulators by the middle of next year, with later deadlines for smaller institutions.  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp board members voted 3-0 on Tuesday to finalize the living will rule required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law. The rule also has to be approved by the Federal Reserve, which is expected to do so within days.  Bank holding companies and other large financial firms with more than $250 billion in non-bank assets will have to file initial plans by July 1, 2012.  Firms with between $100 billion and $250 billion in non-bank assets will have until July 1, 2013, to file plans. All other companies covered by the rule will have until December 31, 2013.  An initial proposal released in April would have required all plans to be filed at the same time.  Banking groups had complained about this timeline and asked that it be staggered for smaller institutions.  The plans will be updated annually.  “The real or hard work, I think, is just beginning to start,” said Thomas Curry, a member of the FDIC board who has been nominated by President Barack Obama to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  The rule applies to banks with more than $50 billion in assets and to other large financial companies whose sudden failure could roil financial markets.  This group includes giant institutions such as Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, but would also apply to smaller competitors such as US Bancorp and PNC Financial.  The rule will cover more than 120 banks, of which about 90 have their headquarters in other countries, FDIC staff said.  NON-BANKS STILL WEIGHED  Regulators have yet to decide which non-bank institutions, such as insurance companies, should also be subject to this rule and more intense oversight by the Federal Reserve.  The intent of the living wills is to avoid the chaos in financial markets that followed Lehman Brothers’ collapse in September of 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.  Regulators have said there will be some back and forth with banks as they write their plans and regulators attempt to get a better handle on their operations.  The law does allow regulators to force institutions to simplify their operations, such as by creating more subsidiaries, if they cannot produce a plan showing how they can be smoothly liquidated.  The rule requires the living wills to be written based on a failing institution going through the bankruptcy process.  The law, however, gives the government power to seize and break up large, failing firms through a new “resolution” process if regulators decide this would be less harmful to markets.  Regulators are writing their own plans for how a bank should be liquidated in this event, but the wills will serve as a guide to this process, FDIC staff said.  Regulators across the globe have agreed that living wills should be part of better bank oversight. The United States has taken the lead in putting these plans into practice.  Foreign banks with U.S. operations have expressed concerns with having to submit detailed plans with U.S. regulators when most of their operations fall outside of their jurisdiction.  To address some of these concerns, FDIC staff said most of these banks will not have to submit their plans until the December 31, 2013, deadline because their ranking under the rule will be based on their total U.S. non-bank assets, not their total non-bank assets.  In addition, the rule states that foreign banks with limited U.S. operations will not have to submit plans as comprehensive as their largest, most complicated U.S. competitors.  Banks, such as Wells Fargo, have also raised concerns about keeping living wills confidential.  FDIC staff said some of the plans would be made public but any information currently protected from release by law will be protected under the rule.  Among the issues related to confidentiality is whether publicly traded companies will have to disclose to investors such things as the rejection of a living will by regulators, according to banking lawyers.  FDIC staff said what has to be disclosed in these instances is a matter of securities law and outside the scope of the rule.  One area of concern for banks will be a requirement that they describe at a “high level” their resolution strategy, including the range of potential purchasers, said Alexandra Steinberg Barrage, an attorney at Morrison & Foerster who advises financial firms.  While the FDIC will allow banks to keep private any information protected by the Freedom of Information Act, they will be required to disclose more specific information about failure planning than they would prefer, she said.  “You can’t get by not saying anything about your resolution plan,” said Barrage.

30,USB,Wells sues JPMorgan over 800 mortgage loans,"(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) was sued by Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which seeks to force it to buy back more than 800 soured mortgage loans that it oversees as trustee.  In a complaint made public on Wednesday in the Delaware Chancery Court, Wells Fargo accused JPMorgan’s EMC Mortgage LLC unit of refusing its demands that EMC buy back the loans, which were contained in Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2.  JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and its EMC unit in 2008.  In the complaint, Wells Fargo said EMC and its affiliates routinely approved mortgage loans despite “clear defects” in loan applications, including faulty appraisals and inflated borrower incomes.  It also said a forensic review showed that EMC breached representations and warranties on 89 percent of a sample of 948 of mortgage loans.  “The loans have been plagued by an alarming rate of defaults and foreclosures,” Wells Fargo said.  JPMorgan spokesman Patrick Linehan declined to comment.  Trustees such as Wells Fargo act on behalf of investors in securities backed by underlying loans.

33,USB,Regional banks get boost from business loans,"(Reuters) - US Bancorp (USB.N) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings as the regional banks made more loans to business customers. But margins on the loans fell, reflecting declines in longer-term interest rates as well as intense competition among regional banks to make new loans. Narrowing lending margins are hurting some smaller banks, particularly those having trouble boosting their loan books. M&T; Bank Corp (MTB.N) shares fell as much as 8.8 percent. Both US Bancorp and PNC reported their commercial loan portfolios grew during the quarter. Analysts said business borrowers are increasingly relying on banks for financing that they used to get from the bond markets and elsewhere. Banks, meanwhile, see commercial customers as a safer bet in the current economy than the real estate loans that turned toxic when the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007. “It’s the one area of the market that’s behaved,” said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst with Guggenheim Securities. Minneapolis-based US Bancorp reported an increase in its overall loan portfolio and made more money from loan interest, despite a decrease in its interest margin. Net interest income — interest earned from loans against what is paid for deposits — increased 5.9 percent from a year earlier to $2.62 billion in the quarter. US Bancorp Chief Financial Officer Andy Cecere said the bank expects its net interest margin to decline by 0.03 to 0.06 percentage point in the fourth quarter. The bank’s net interest margin was 3.65 percent in third quarter. US Bancorp said total commercial loans increased 11.9 percent in the third quarter, and commercial loan commitments increased 16.8 percent. During a conference call with analysts, US Bancorp Chief Executive Richard Davis said the bank is adding larger corporate customers that borrowed from international banks before the financial crisis. He said commercial credit line use remains low, and the bank expects its loan portfolio to swell when the economy begins to gain steam and businesses borrow to expand. “I can’t even tell you how much our bank can grow without adding even one new customer,” he said. US Bancorp posted quarterly earnings of $1.27 billion, or 64 cents per share, up from $908 million, or 45 cents per share, a year ago. Pittsburgh-based PNC reported net income of $834 million, or $1.55 per share, down from $1.1 billion, or $2.07 per share, a year earlier. The 2010 results included an after-tax gain of $328 million from the sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing. PNC’s revenue declined 2.7 percent to $3.5 billion, but the bank cut noninterest expenses 4.5 percent to $2.1 billion. PNC increased total loans by $4.2 billion from the second quarter, to $155 billion. Commercial lending increased $3.7 billion, and consumer lending by $500 million. US Bancorp shares were little changed and PNC shares were up 1.3 percent in afternoon trading. Separately, PNC CEO James Rohr said the bank expects to receive a ruling from regulators during the fourth quarter on whether the bank needs to issue stock as part of its buyout of Royal Bank of Canada’s U.S. branches. The deal, announced in June, is expected to be completed next March. Other banks were penalized by investors for failing to rein in expenses. M&T; shares were down 5.8 percent at $72.60, off an earlier low of $70.26, after the bank’s quarterly results fell well short of Wall Street expectations.

Net income was $1.27 billion, or 64 cents per share, up from $908 million, or 45 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts on average expected 62 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Minneapolis-based bank’s revenue growth outpaced expense growth during the quarter. Net revenues rose 4.5 percent to $4.8 billion, while noninterest expenses increased 3.8 percent to $2.48 billion. Net interest income — interest earned from loans against what is paid for deposits — accounted for much of the revenue growth, increasing 5.9 percent to $2.62 billion.

38,USB,S&P; cuts US regional bank ratings on new criteria,"Dec 6 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor’s reduced credit ratings on Tuesday for several regional banks in North America, including US Bancorp , PNC Financial Services Group Inc, and BB&T; Corp as the agency continued to apply new grading criteria announced last month. The long-term ratings on the three bank holding companies were cut by one notch each as the agency updated its ratings on 31 regional banks and subsidiaries in North America. Short-term ratings for PNC and BB&T; were also lowered. Last week, S&P; updated its ratings on 37 of the largest banks in the world, reducing its grades on 15 of the groups. The agency began overhauling its criteria more than a year ago as part of broad effort to improve its scoring following criticism it made ratings mistakes which contributed to the financial crisis. Among Tuesday’s actions: U.S. Bancorp’s long-term rating was cut to A from A+ and left its short-term rating A-1. PNC’s long-term rating for was cut to A-minus from A and its short-term rating was cut to A-2 from A-1.

40,USB,Fed gives high marks in bank stress tests results,"(Reuters) - Most of the largest banks passed their annual stress test, the Federal Reserve revealed in an earlier-than-expected release of the results, after JPMorgan Chase pulled the trigger on announcing its glowing marks and helped lift the stock market. But the failing grade for Citigroup, the nation’s third-largest bank, was a substantial surprise. Going into the tests some analysts felt it had a better chance of a positive surprise than any other financial institution. The Fed said on Tuesday that 15 of the 19 banks tested could take a financial shock that would see unemployment hit 13 percent and housing prices drop 21 percent. MetLife, the largest life insurer in the United States, was also among the four financial institutions that failed the exam, which applied worst-case stress scenarios looking out through the end of 2013. Ally Financial and SunTrust were also at the bottom of the heap. Among the winners was JPMorgan, which has been agitating for regulators to loosen the handcuffs on the ability of banks to raise dividends and buy back stock. The Fed uses the annual stress tests to give the markets a window into the health of the U.S. bank industry, and also determine if individual banks are strong enough to reduce their capital buffers. JPMorgan, in a surprise to markets, announced around 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) that the Fed had given it permission to raise its quarterly dividend by a nickel to 30 cents and buy back as much as $12 billion of stock this year. The news helped the U.S. stock market post its best day this year. The Fed had been scheduled to release the test results after markets closed on Thursday. A senior Federal Reserve official told reporters that it came to the Fed’s attention Monday evening that there may have been an inadvertent release of some information. The Fed official, who could not be quoted by name, said JPMorgan’s announcement was the result of less-than-perfect communication between the bank and its regulator, and said that nobody at JPMorgan was at fault. Regarding the outcome of the tests, the Fed official said the capital positions of U.S. banks has improved substantially in the last three years. The Fed took a tough line with the banks, and in a number of instances, the central bank’s estimates of banks’ losses under the hypothetical financial shock were larger than the firms’ own, the official said. The Fed faces pressure to be tough enough so that the tests have credibility, but not so tough that the results spook markets. “Overall, we can’t complain that these tests weren’t rigorous enough and it’s good to know that most banks would at least survive another global financial meltdown. Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean that the U.S. economy would be unaffected by a meltdown in Europe,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. The Fed released 82 pages of detailed information showing how the 19 banks fared under the hypothetical stress scenario. The regulator left it to the banks themselves to reveal if they had received permission to boost dividends or buy back stock. The regulator said Citigroup, Ally Financial and SunTrust fared worst under the hypothetical shock, with Tier 1 common capital ratios of 4.9 percent, 4.4 percent, and 4.8 percent respectively. MetLife failed the stress tests on the basis of its risk-based capital ratio. At a 6 percent minimum, it was lower than any of the other banks examined. The bank holding companies that came out top were Bank of New York Mellon with a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 13.1 percent under the hypothetical financial shock, State Street Corp with 12.5 percent and American Express with 10.8 percent. Wells Fargo was allowed to increase its quarterly cash dividend rate to 22 cents, while U.S. Bancorp got permission for a 56 percent increase in its dividend to 78 cents. BB&T; declared a 4 cent quarterly increase per share for 2012, and American Express and KeyCorp both said they got permission for both a dividend increase and stock repurchase. PNC said it received no objection for a dividend raise and modest stock repurchase program.

41,USB,DEALTALK-Bank stress tests reveal appetite for M&A;,"* Banks with low payout ratios may be hunting deals * U.S. Bancorp sees “amazing” growth opportunity * PNC Financial seen “ready to go” on next acquisition NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Banks did not have to spell out long-range acquisition plans to the Federal Reserve in their stress test scenarios, but investors are scrutinizing test results released this week for hints. Attention in recent days has focused on the host of dividend increases and stock buybacks announced after the Fed ruled on the capital plans of 19 large U.S. banks. But analysts are drilling down to determine if the level of payout ratios — the amount of projected profit a bank is spending on dividends and buybacks — signals which banks may be saving up for acquisitions. “To acquire an attractive new franchise, a U.S. bank has to reassure regulators that they can fund the new acquisitions and still meet worst-case stress tests,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz wrote Reuters in an e-mail. “Not raising dividends could well imply a management team that wishes to go shopping.” The test results go a long way toward establishing that major super-regional banks, including Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp and Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group, are well-capitalized companies with strong appetites for acquisition. PNC has a low payout ratio and U.S. Bancorp boasts that even with newly raised dividend and buyback programs it can deploy capital on acquisitions. PNC, which this month closed on its purchase of about 400 Royal Bank of Canada branches in the southeastern United States, is focused on integrating the branches but continues to “look at stuff all the time,” Senior Vice Chairman William Demchak said on March 8 at an investor presentation. “Most of the smaller institutions that come onto the market have fairly troubled balance sheets, still,” he cautioned. However, one investment banker who has worked with PNC said, “Now that they’ve got the big Southeast deal behind them they’re ready to go” on future acquisitions. A bank spokesman declined to comment. PNC, which has more than $271 billion of assets, said last week it would recommend to its board a “modest share repurchase” program and an unspecified dividend increase. It now returns a below-average 37 percent of its net income to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, according to an analysis of the bank stress tests by Nomura Securities, well below the 90 percent and greater payouts planned by such banks s as JPMorgan Chase & Co and State Street Corp, according to an analysis by Nomura of post-stress test capital announcements. U.S. Bancorp, which has more than $340 billion of assets, has been less subtle than PNC in signaling its growth intentions. “We’re the fifth-largest commercial bank in America, but we’re not even close to 10 percent of anything,” U.S. Bancorp Chief Executive and Chairman Richard Davis said at Citigroup’s banking conference earlier this month, referring to the regulatory cap on deposit share. “We’ve got so much opportunity it’s just amazing.” He said the bank aims to pay 60 percent to 80 percent of its earning in dividends and buybacks but added a proviso. “Should there be an opportunity of any size then we’ll evaluate that,” he said. “The buybacks are something you can stop and start as quickly as you’d like.” A bank spokesman declined to elaborate. In the past four years U.S. Bancorp has bought more than 10 credit card and payment systems portfolios in the United States  and Mexico worth $3.2 billion, eight consumer and wholesale banks with $30 billion of loans and another $30 billion of deposits, and seven corporate trust and mutual fund servicing divisions with $1.1 trillion of assets from other banks. BB&T; Financial, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is another bank that could be in the mix for acquisitions. Largely an agglomeration of community banks, it is currently negotiating the purchase of Florida’s BankAtlantic Bancorp and the life and property & casualty insurance units of Crump Group — deals included in its capital plan to the Fed. Though the bank said in a statement that it is “among industry leaders in dividend yield among S&P; 500 banks,” Nomura said its combined dividend/stock buyback yield is a low 30 percent of projected 2012 earnings. Michael Rose, an analyst at Raymond James Financial, wrote in a report to clients that BB&T;, which announced a 25 percent quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents a share after passing the stress test, remains interested in “strategic opportunities.” Regulators, to be sure, under political pressure to reduce systemic risk and restrict rampant growth at banks, are putting both large and small acquisition requests under tighter scrutiny. It took almost eight months for the Federal Reserve to approve Capital One’s $9 billion acquisition of Dutch bank ING’s American online banking business, ING Direct, a relatively straightforward deal, said merger bankers. The transaction was approved last month. “An M&A; transaction is a whole separate order of magnitude from dividend raises and buyback increases, adding potential operational risk on top of the capital implications of taking on another balance sheet,” said Herb Lurie, senior managing director of the financial institutions group at Guggenheim Securities. “The regulators are being very careful about dotting every ‘i’ and crossing every ‘t’ to address concerns about the perceived size and complexity of the larger banks.” Lurie, nevertheless, said that the ability to cut costs at a time when revenue growth is hard to come by remains a compelling argument for bank mergers over the next 24 months. In addition to scrutinizing whole-bank purchases, potential acquirers may be sizing up the U.S. assets of capital-hungry European banks. Investors are hearing that State Street Corp and Bank of New York Mellon Corp are reviewing the global custody units of French banks BNP Paribas and Societe Generale , according to Bernstein’s Hintz. A spokesman at Societe Generale declined comment but noted that it has a nonequity “commercial” alliance with U.S. Bancorp for servicing shareholders of U.S.- and European-domiciled funds. A BNP Paribas spokeswoman did not immediately respond. Spokespeople at Bank of New York and State Street said the banks do not comment on market rumors. Merger bankers say the one near-certainty in the M&A; game is that the six biggest U.S. banks — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group and  Morgan Stanley — won’t be participants. The traditional commercial banks among them are bumping up against 10 percent market-share limits on deposits and all are constrained by the need to raise more capital and by political opposition to megabanks. (The exception may be Wells Fargo, which has room for one more medium-sized bank acquisition, several bankers said.)

42,USB,ON THE MOVE-U.S. Bancorp hires wealth veterans from Bank of America,"April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp has landed a senior wealth adviser and a managing director from Bank of America Corp’s U.S. Trust as the company expands its private wealth presence in New York and Florida. The Minneapolis-based bank hired former U.S. Trust and Citi Private Bank veteran Joel Yudenfreund to its Private Client Reserve team in Palm Beach, Florida. Yudenfreund joined the bank as a wealth management strategist in a new role created to help expand the company’s South Florida market. “We have one for each region, where they can attract clients on their own,” U.S. Bank’s Heidi Steiger said on Wednesday. Steiger, who oversees the East region of U.S. Bank’s high-net-worth Private Client Reserve unit, said she saw Yudenfreund’s deep client relationships and specialized background in law as huge assets. “We’re at a moment where clients are looking for an institution that will be very proactive and very personalized in their approach,” Steiger said. “From the standpoint of a legal expertise, he has a broad-based knowledge to work with clients on specialized planning.” U.S. Bank also recruited veteran manager Raymond Radigan to join its New York office to serve as a managing director of trust for the Private Client Reserve’s Atlantic region. In his previous role at Bank of America, Radigan oversaw the administration of trust accounts in New York for U.S. Trust, the bank’s private wealth management division. Radigan said his decision to move over to U.S. Bank was in part due to the potential he saw in expanding the company’s presence along the East Coast. “I thought it was a great opportunity to leverage the resources of U.S. Bank,” Radigan said. While he will primarily oversee trust activity in the U.S. Bank’s Florida and New York markets, Radigan will also be involved in business development along the East Coast and work to bolster the company’s private client base across the region. “Our private bank presence is primarily in New York and Florida, but we’re looking at all meaningful opportunities in between,” Radigan said. “Our job is to spread the word.” U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve, a division of the bank’s Wealth Management Group, caters to high-net-worth clients with $1 million or more in investable assets.",4112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank/on-the-move-u-s-bancorp-hires-wealth-veterans-from-bank-of-america-idUSL2E8FAE5B20120411
43,USB,"BofA, U.S. Bancorp sued for role as WaMu bond trustee","(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) have been sued by a Chicago pension fund that said they failed to protect investors in their roles as trustees for mortgage-backed securities for Washington Mutual Inc. Wednesday’s complaint was filed eight days after U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan let four pension funds pursue similar claims against Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) over its role as trustee for Countrywide Financial Corp mortgage debt. A lawyer whose firm represents investors in both cases has said she believed Pauley’s “watershed” decision was the first to let mortgage-backed securities investors pursue claims against a trustee under the 1939 federal Trust Indenture Act. In the latest case, also filed in Manhattan federal court, the Policemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of the City of Chicago accused Bank of America and successor trustee U.S. Bancorp of causing millions of dollars of losses by failing to properly oversee 41 Washington Mutual trusts backed by home loans. Saying it invested in six of those trusts, the fund accused both banks of failing to take possession of loan files or ensuring they were complete, or requiring Washington Mutual to fix or buy back defective loans. Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, declined immediate comment, saying the bank was reviewing the complaint. U.S. Bancorp spokeswoman Teri Charest said the complaint “contains numerous misstatements and mischaracterizations of U.S. Bank’s role as trustee. Plaintiff freely admits that it did not even invest in most of the trusts about which it sues.

46,USB,UPDATE 3-U.S. Bancorp beats Street; mortgage revenue soars,"* Q1 EPS 67 cents vs Street view 64 cents * Mortgage banking revenue more than doubles * Shares close up 1.25 percent By Rick Rothacker and Eileen Soreng April 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp has been bulking up its mortgage business while others scaled back, and the expansion paid off with first-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations. The Minneapolis-based regional bank said on Tuesday that net income grew nearly 28 percent to $1.3 billion, driven by an increase in total revenue and improved credit quality. Like other large banks, U.S. Bancorp received a boost as borrowers refinanced home loans at low interest rates. Mortgage banking revenue more than doubled to $452 million. U.S. Bancorp expects to become a top five player in U.S. mortgage originations and servicing, Chief Executive Officer Richard Davis said in a conference call with analysts. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, it was fifth in originations in the fourth quarter of 2011 and sixth in servicing. “We see a market share (opportunity) that you only get once in a lifetime, and we intend to enjoy it now,” Davis said. U.S. Bancorp may jump to fourth in mortgage originations in the first quarter, moving ahead of Bank of America Corp, said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. Bank of America, which has faced huge losses and lawsuits from its Countrywide Financial acquisition, last year stopped buying mortgages from smaller lenders as it focused on making loans through its own branches. U.S. Bancorp has been adding technology, people and mortgages offices in recent years, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Cecere said in an interview. It has moved up more than 15 spots in the rankings but is unlikely to enter the top three because of the size of the banks ahead of it, he said. Wells Fargo & Co is the largest U.S. mortgage originator and servicer, making nearly one in three home loans and tallying more than six times U.S Bancorp’s volume. The mortgage business has been rocky for some banks because of complaints about their handling of foreclosures during the U.S. housing crisis. On Tuesday, a nonprofit group accused U.S. Bancorp of failing to maintain and market foreclosed homes in minority neighborhoods compared with those vacant properties it owns in predominately white areas. The National Fair Housing Alliance filed a discrimination complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The group examined 177 of U.S. Bancorp’s properties in seven cities as part of a larger probe on how U.S. lenders keep up with bank-owned properties. In the vast majority of cases where U.S. Bancorp is involved in a foreclosure it is the trustee for an investment pool where the mortgage is held, Cecere said. In those cases, the servicer of the loan is responsible for the foreclosure and the upkeep of the home, not the trustee, he said. Cecere said the bank plans to remain a big player in the corporate trustee business despite bad publicity related to foreclosures. “We just need to explain our role,” he said. The company reported first-quarter earnings per share of 67 cents per share, up from 52 cents per share, a year earlier.     Analysts, on average, had expected the bank to earn 64 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue increased 9.1 percent to $4.9 billion. U.S. Bancorp shares closed up 39 cents, or 1.2e percent, at $31.55.",4172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usbancorp/update-3-u-s-bancorp-beats-street-mortgage-revenue-soars-idUSL3E8FH55K20120417

48,USB,TEXT-S&P; says U.S. Bancorp rtgs unaffected by strong Q1 results,"April 17 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services today said its ratings and outlook on U.S. Bancorp  (USB; A/Stable/A-1) are not affected by the company’s strong first-quarter earnings, given the current operating conditions.	 	 The company posted Standard & Poor’s-adjusted pretax earnings of $1.83 	 billion, up from $1.59 billion the previous quarter and $1.4 billion the prior 	 year.  	 	 In the first quarter, adjusted revenue increased 1.8% from the previous 	 quarter and 10.2% year over year because of an increase in average earning 	 assets and fee-based income. The net interest margin (NIM) was unchanged from 	 the fourth quarter at 3.60% as a reduction in cash at the Federal Reserve and 	 a change in the classification of credit card balance transfer fees offset 	 growth in lower-yielding assets. We expect the NIM to decline a few basis 	 points from its current level because of the low interest rates. However, we 	 believe net interest income will increase as a result of higher average 	 earning assets, particularly ongoing loan growth.  	 	 Standard & Poor’s-adjusted noninterest income rose 3.3% from the fourth 	 quarter, largely because of significantly higher mortgage banking revenue. 	 This was partially offset by lower credit and debit card revenue, merchant 	 processing revenue, deposit charges, and ATM revenue due to a classification 	 change. We expect mortgage banking revenue to decline in the second half of 	 2012 because we believe margins on mortgage production will compress from 	 their currently elevated levels.	 	 Expenses declined 5.0% from the fourth quarter, but most of the decline 	 resulted from the inclusion of a $130 million litigation accrual concerning 	 mortgage servicing matters in the fourth quarter. Excluding possible further 	 litigation accruals, we believe that expenses will rise modestly in 2012 on a 	 year-over-year basis but that operating leverage will remain positive. 	 	 Average total loans rose 1.5% from the previous quarter and 6.3% year over 	 year (excluding acquisitions), largely because of market share gains and 	 higher consumer and commercial loan growth. We believe USB will continue to 	 garner loans, partially as a result of customer loan growth and USB’s 	 participation in the syndicated loan market. 	 	 Net charge-offs declined 8.2% from the previous quarter, and USB released $90 	 million in reserves (versus $125 million in the previous quarter), reflecting 	 improving credit quality. Notably, allowance to nonperforming assets 	 (excluding covered assets) was 199% at the end of the first quarter, versus 	 191% the previous quarter. Based on declining nonperforming assets, we believe 	 net charge-offs will continue to decrease in 2012, but at a slower pace than 	 in 2011.	 	 USB’s Tier 1 common ratio was 8.7% at the end of the first quarter, up 10 	 basis points from the previous quarter. The company estimates its Basel III 	 Tier 1 common ratio at 8.4%. Share repurchases and dividends totaled 66% of 	 earnings in the first quarter. We expect share repurchases and dividends to 	 comprise up to 60%-80% of USB’s earnings on an ongoing basis. Still, we 	 believe that USB’s risk-adjusted capital ratio, as measured by Standard & 	 Poor’s, will rise modestly to 8.2%-8.7% during the next 12-18 months.",4172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA512520120417

US Bancorp (USB.N) bought a $180 million loan tied to property owned by General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N) at a slight discount to face value, paying in the high 90s percent of loan value, a source said. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) teamed up to buy about $560 million of loans. The bank and the private equity group have agreed to own the individual loans separately and not co-own any of them, a source said. The $740 million in performing loans were put on the market by Eurohypo as it unwinds its balance sheet of about $4 billion of U.S. loans. Jones Lang LaSalle Inc (JLL.N) began marketing the loans last month, attracting more than 100 interested parties.

US Bancorp bought a $180 million loan tied to property owned by General Growth Properties Inc at a slight discount to face value, paying in the high 90s percent of loan value, a source said. Wells Fargo & Co and Blackstone Group LP  teamed up to buy about $560 million of loans. The bank and the private equity group have agreed to own the individual loans     separately and not co-own any of them, a source said. The $740 million in performing loans were put on the market by Eurohypo as it unwinds its balance sheet of about $4 billion of U.S. loans.

53,USB,Wells Fargo increases mortgage dominance,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co made a record 33.9 percent of U.S. mortgage loans in the first quarter, as rivals such as Bank of America Corp continued to pull back in the home lending market. Wells Fargo’s loan volume more than tripled the 10.6 percent market share of its nearest rival, JPMorgan Chase & Co, as it increased its dominance in the industry, according to a report released on Thursday by industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. U.S. Bancorp jumped to third from fifth. The rankings show diverging strategies for some of the largest U.S. banks at a time of shrinking loan volume and increased regulatory scrutiny of the industry. Wells Fargo and US Bancorp made more loans in the first quarter, while J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Citigroup all saw their volume shrink compared with the fourth quarter. Total mortgage originations of $385 billion in the first quarter were down from $400 billion in the fourth quarter, but up from $335 billion a year ago. Mortgage banking income helped boost results at Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp when they reported earnings last month. At an investor conference on Tuesday, Wells chief financial officer Tim Sloan said the bank’s market share could continue to grow in the current environment. “We like the business a lot,” Sloan said. Last month, U.S. Bancorp CEO Richard Davis said the Minneapolis-based regional bank had added mortgage offices, loan officers and new technology to become a bigger player in the business. “We see a market share (opportunity) that you only get once in a lifetime,” Davis said. Meanwhile, Bank of America, which has faced huge losses and lawsuits from its 2008 Countrywide Financial acquisition, stopped buying mortgages last year from smaller lenders - a business known as correspondent lending - as it focused on making loans through its own branches. Remaining fourth in the rankings, its total volume fell by more than one-fourth to $16 billion from the fourth quarter. Bank of America’s Countrywide purchase initially made it the largest U.S. mortgage lender.

It is part of nationwide customer litigation against 35 lenders over the fees, which are typically assessed when customers overdraw their checking accounts by using debit cards. Brought on behalf of millions of customers, the lawsuits accused banks of ordering transactions from largest to smallest, rather than processing them in chronological order. They said this let banks charge overdraft fees, which are typically $25 to $35, sooner and more often because account balances fell faster. Fourteen lenders have settled, according to lawyers for the customers.

58,USB,"Los Angeles sues U.S. Bancorp, calls bank a slumlord","NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles has sued U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), accusing a unit of the fifth-largest U.S. commercial bank of becoming one of the city’s biggest slumlords and blighting the city by allowing hundreds of foreclosed homes to fall into disrepair. Monday’s civil lawsuit by the office of Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich alleges that U.S. Bank NA has taken title to more than 1,500 foreclosed residential properties in the city in its role as trustee for various mortgage-backed securities trusts. “This lawsuit is a deterrent. It’s a message to other banks; step up and do the right thing,” Trutanich told reporters on Tuesday on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall. Asked if the city would sue other banks, Trutanich said “that is one of the arrows in the quiver,” but did not name any potential targets. In its complaint, Los Angeles said that at least since July 2008, U.S. Bank has “disregarded virtually every one of its legal duties and responsibilities as owner, resulting in the creation and maintenance of an alarming number of vacant nuisance properties and substandard occupied housing units.” It said the bank ignored repeated demands that it comply with the law, causing hundreds of homes to become uninhabitable or “public nuisances” and resulting in illegal evictions of hundreds of tenants from the second most-populous U.S. city. Los Angeles said it is seeking a civil fine of $2,500 a day for each violation by what it called “one of the largest slumlords in the city.” It estimated potential liability in the “hundreds of millions of dollars.” Thomas Joyce, a spokesman for Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, said it is the mortgage servicers, not the trustee, who have the responsibility to maintain foreclosed properties and that “we intend to bring them into” the lawsuit. Joyce also said the city only recently agreed to detail which homes needed better upkeep and that the bank will “stand ready” to address property-specific and general foreclosure concerns as it has done in other cities. Trutanich said U.S. Bancorp remains responsible. “When you own a piece of property, you’re at the top of the food chain and you can try to deflect and say someone else is responsible, but you’re the owner,” he said. The case against US Bancorp follows a May 2011 lawsuit in which Trutanich’s office accused Germany’s Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) of letting its real estate properties deteriorate into slum conditions. Other large U.S. cities have also sued over mortgage industry practices they allege contributed to urban blight. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the nation’s largest mortgage lender, settled a lawsuit in May by Memphis, Tennessee, and on July 12, it settled a similar case involving Baltimore. The Baltimore accord was reached in connection with the San Francisco-based bank’s $175 million settlement with the federal government over allegations it overcharged black and Hispanic borrowers on mortgages, contributing to higher foreclosures. Wells Fargo was one of five big servicers to join February’s $25 billion U.S. settlement over foreclosure abuses. The National Fair Housing Alliance filed discrimination complaints with the federal government in April against both U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo, accusing them of doing a better job maintaining foreclosed homes in white neighborhoods than in minority neighborhoods. According to the 2010 census, Los Angeles had 1.41 million housing units, of which about 95,000 were vacant. The city’s population was about 3.79 million.

61,USB,Loans surge at PNC and US Bancorp but profits diverge,"* US Bancorp boosted commercial loans 20 pct in second qtr * PNC Financial takes big hit to satisfy home loan repurchase demands * Bank CEOs warn of waning client confidence in global economy NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - Two big U.S. regional banks on Wednesday reported a surge in loan demand in the second quarter but said borrowers were getting nervous about the economy. U.S. Bancorp, the fifth biggest U.S. bank by assets, said its second-quarter profit rose 21 percent to $1.41 billion, or 71 cents per share, from a year earlier on a 20 percent rise in total loans to businesses and industries and on strong mortgage originations that led to record quarterly revenue. Despite the persistence of rock-bottom interest rates, the Minneapolis-based bank company said net interest revenue grew 6.6 percent as its loan book grew. Profit margins on its loans dipped only slightly as the bank offset falling rates by paying less for deposits and retiring its own high-rate debt. Fee income also soared as borrowers took advantage of low rates to refinance their mortgages. Shares of U.S. Bancorp, which have gained about 19 percent this year, closed up another 1.6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Despite the upbeat report, U.S. Bancorp Chief Executive Richard Davis was cautious about customers’ appetite for loans and investing. “In the last month it’s started to taper off,” he said on a conference call with analysts. He cited borrowers’ concerns about the U.S. presidential election, the impending “fiscal cliff” budget-tax battle and persistent problems in Europe. The U.S. economy “is not falling apart  but not getting better,” he said. Davis also excoriated the city of Los Angeles, which on Tuesday called U.S. Bancorp a slumlord as it sued the bank for allegedly letting hundreds of foreclosed homes in the city fall into disrepair. “As long as the economy is weak, everybody anywhere will try to find a deep pocket,” he said, adding that he is not close to considering settling the lawsuit. The bank doesn’t own the properties at issue but is acting as trustee for mortgage security holders, he said. It has tried to negotiate for 18 months and believes that no bank will take the role of trustee if the lawsuit succeeds. U.S. Bancorp said the quality of its home loan and other portfolios continues to improve. It added $470 million to its reserve for problem loans, 18 percent less than a year ago and 2 percent below last quarter’s addition. It also said that demands from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors to repurchase poorly performing loans it sold to them have stabilized. That’s in sharp contrast to PNC Financial Services Group , which on Wednesday said it put aside $438 million to meet such repurchase demands and could lose as much as $350 million more in coming quarters. Most of the mortgages were originated between 2006 and 2008 and sold to the agencies to package into securities. The big reserve, which was greater than an estimate PNC had given earlier, contributed to a 40 percent decline in second-quarter net income and dominated the bank’s conference call with analysts. The bank also took charges for redeeming high-cost debt and for integrating more than 400 branches bought from Royal Bank of Canada in March. PNC said its commercial loans soared 28 percent from last year and 3 percent from the first quarter, while consumer loans led by auto loans were up 10 percent from a year ago and 1 percent from the first quarter. CEO Jim Rohr, however, echoed Davis’s concerns about a weak economy. The European crisis and the fiscal cliff has “had a pall over the market over the last couple of months,” he said on a conference call with analysts. “We continue to grow loans, but when we talk to our customers, their business is still good, they’re still making a lot of money, but they are a little more nervous about things in general,” he said. Shares of PNC, which had been up about 4 percent this year, lost .94 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.",7182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/regional-earnings-pnc-usb/loans-surge-at-pnc-and-us-bancorp-but-profits-diverge-idUSL2E8IID1O20120718

64,USB,TEXT-S&P; says U.S. Bancorp ratings unaffected by Q2 earnings,"July 18 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services today said its ratings and outlook on U.S. Bancorp (USB; A/Stable/A-1) are not affected by the company’s strong second-quarter earnings, given the current operating conditions.  The company posted pretax earnings of $1.94 billion, up from $1.83 billion the  previous quarter and $1.64 billion the prior year.    In the second quarter, revenue increased 2.9% from the previous quarter and  8.2% year over year because of an increase in average earning assets and  fee-based income, particularly mortgage banking. The net interest margin (NIM)  was 3.58%, down 2 basis points from the first quarter on higher balances in  lower-yielding securities and a decline in low yields, partially offset by  lower borrowing rates and a reduction in cash at the Federal Reserve. We  expect net interest income to increase as a result of higher average earning  assets, particularly ongoing loan growth.  Standard & Poor’s-adjusted noninterest income rose 5.2% versus the previous  quarter, largely because of a significant increase in mortgage banking revenue  and higher payment revenue, reflecting increased volumes. Although the  mortgage banking pipeline was strong at the end of the second quarter, we  expect mortgage banking revenue to decline by the fourth quarter as the number  of borrowers that are qualified to refinance declines. However, we expect the  NIM to remain relatively flat as lower rates on long-term debt likely will  offset lower-yielding assets.  Expenses increased 1.6% from the first quarter as a result of the Visa  settlement and higher professional services related to a mortgage servicing  review project. Lower marketing costs offset the higher expenses. Excluding  possible further litigation accruals, we expect that expenses will rise  modestly in 2012 year over year, but that operating leverage will remain  positive.   Average total loans rose 2.4% from the previous quarter (excluding covered  loans) and 10.0% year over year (excluding covered loans), largely because of  market share gains and higher consumer and commercial loan growth. We believe  USB will continue to garner loans, partially reflecting customer loan growth  and its participation in the syndicated loan market.   Net charge-offs declined 8.9% from the previous quarter to $520 million, and  USB released $50 million in reserves (versus $90 million in the previous  quarter), reflecting improving credit quality. Notably, allowance to  nonperforming loans (excluding covered loans) was 247% at the end of the  second quarter, versus 238% the previous quarter. Based on this, we believe  net charge-offs will continue to decline in 2012, though at a slower pace than  in 2011, particularly considering that annualized net charge-offs of 0.98% are  already lower than historical levels.  USB’s Tier 1 common ratio was 8.8% at the end of the second quarter, up 10 bps  from the previous quarter. The company estimates its Basel III Tier 1 common  ratio at 7.9%, down 50 basis points from its previous estimate, reflecting new  regulatory guidance under the Fed’s Notices of Proposed Rulemaking on the  implementation of Basel III. Share repurchases and dividends were 62% of  earnings year to date. We expect share repurchases and dividends to comprise  up to 60%-80% of USB’s earnings. Still, we believe that USB’s risk-adjusted  capital (RAC) ratio, based on our calculation, will rise modestly to 8.2%-8.7%  during the next 12-18 months.  The stable outlook reflects our view that profit generation will likely remain  better than peers’ and that asset quality should continue to improve.",7182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA132720120718
65,USB,"U.S. Bancorp profit rises as loans grow, credit quality improves","(Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as total loans grew and the fifth-largest U.S. commercial bank set aside less money to cover soured loans. The Minneapolis-based lender, one of the country’s strongest regional banks, also got a boost in fee income as borrowers refinanced home loans to take advantage of low interest rates. Mortgage banking revenue for the second-quarter more than doubled to $490 million from a year earlier. Mortgage-lending has been weak for many banks since the housing crisis and ensuing rash of foreclosures, which discouraged many borrowers from getting into the housing market. Los Angeles sued U.S. Bancorp on Tuesday, accusing a subsidiary of the bank of becoming one of its biggest slum lords and blighting the city by allowing hundreds of foreclosed homes to fall into disrepair. U.S. Bancorp’s net income rose to $1.41 billion, or 71 cents per share, from $1.20 billion, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the bank posted a profit of 73 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected the bank to earn 70 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Our results benefited from solid balance sheet and fee income growth this quarter.

70,USB,"U.S. Bancorp, PNC latest bank websites to face access issues","* Wells Fargo website facing lingering problems * US Bancorp says working with federal officials * PNC, also threatened, says taking precautions By Rick Rothacker Sept 26 (Reuters) - Some U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services customers were having trouble accessing the banks’ websites on Wednesday, as U.S. financial institutions appear to be threatened by another round of cyber attacks. Wells Fargo & Co also faced lingering problems with its website after customers had intermittent access issues on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the bank said. U.S. Bancorp is experiencing “unusual and high-traffic volume” on its site that is designed to slow down the system, bank spokesman Tom Joyce said. The problem is similar to what other banks have faced in the past week, he said. “We are working closely with federal law enforcement officials to address this issue,” he said. Customers data and funds are not at risk, he added. A PNC spokesman said some if its customers may be experiencing difficulty logging into the bank’s website on the first attempt. “We are aware of the situation and are working to restore full access,” spokesman Fred Solomon said. The attacks came after a posting on the Internet on Tuesday by an unknown person, calling for cyber attacks this week against Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and PNC. A similar posting last week warned of attacks against Bank of America Corp  and the New York Stock Exchange. The person who posted the message on a site called pastebin.com said the attacks will continue until the film that had stirred anti-U.S. protests across the Middle East was removed from the Internet. “Obviously, it looks coordinated,” said Jeff Herdell, founder of a website called Sitedown.co, which has been tracking customer complaints about the banks’ websites. So-called denial-of-service campaigns are among the oldest types of cyber attacks and do not require highly skilled computer programmers or advanced expertise, compared with sophisticated and destructive weapons like Stuxnet, a virus widely believed to have been developed by the United States to damage Iran’s nuclear program. But the attacks can still be disruptive: If a bank’s website is repeatedly shut down, the attacks can hurt its reputation, affect customer retention and cause revenue losses as customers cannot open accounts or conduct other business. The attacks also cost banks because they have to add staff to handle phone calls and pay for additional network bandwidth. Senator Joseph Lieberman, chairman of the Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said on Friday that he believes Iran was behind the attacks. “I think this was done by Iran and the Quds Force, which has its own developing cyber attack capability,” Lieberman said during a taping of C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” program. The Quds Force is a covert arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. Reuters reported on Friday that Iranian hackers have repeatedly attacked Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Citigroup Inc over the past year as part of a broad cyber campaign targeting the United States. The attacks, which began in late 2011 and escalated this year, have primarily been “denial of service” campaigns that  disrupted the banks’ websites and corporate networks by overwhelming them with incoming web traffic, said sources.",9262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/banks-websites/u-s-bancorp-pnc-latest-bank-websites-to-face-access-issues-idUSL1E8KQBEO20120926

73,USB,UPDATE 2-U.S. Bancorp deposit growth outpaces loans,"* Deposits up 11 pct in 3rd quarter * Interest margin down to 3.59 pct * CFO expects interest margin to fall a bit more By David Henry and Jochelle Mendonca Oct 17 (Reuters) - Deposits are growing faster than U.S. Bancorp can find borrowers to take the new money, executives of the bank said on Wednesday after the bank reported higher third-quarter profits. “Our deposits continue to grow at amazing levels and, much as I like that, those deposits need to start getting used,” chief executive Richard Davis said in a conference call after posting the results. The average level of deposits in the quarter at the bank rose 11.1 percent from a year earlier to $239 billion, while loans increased 7.3 percent to $217 billion. Deposit inflows quickened in the last three months. Compared with the second quarter, deposits soared at annualized rate of about 14 percent, nearly three times as fast as loans. Banks throughout the industry say weak customer demand for money and low interest rates are holding down the profitability of loans, known as net interest margin. U.S. Bancorp said its net interest margin fell to 3.59 percent from 3.65 percent a year earlier. The Minneapolis-based lender is the fifth largest commercial bank in the United States. Chief Financial Officer Andy Cecere expects the margin to fall another few hundredths of a percentage point in the fourth quarter as debt securities in the bank’s portfolio mature and leave the company with more cash to be invested at lower rates. Still, the bank delivered a 14 percent increase in profits for common shareholders from a year earlier as the bank racked up fees from a surge in home loan refinancing. The bank also benefited from lower costs for bad loans and from operating leverage as expense grew less than revenues. Analysts expect mortgage lending volume to continue to rise after the Federal Reserve said in September it would buy up to $40 billion of mortgage bonds every month until the labor market improved materially. Cecere said in an interview that he expects the wave of mortgage refinancing to continue in “the next few quarters” if interest rates stay at current levels. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co  both posted record quarterly profits last week on the back of the improving mortgage market. U.S. Bancorp said net income for common shareholders was $1.40 billion, or 74 cents per share, up from $1.24 billion, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Fitch Ratings commented later that the bank delivered “a very strong 1.7 percent return on assets. The bank has been bulking up its mortgage business at a time when large lenders such as Bank of America Corp have been pulling back. Mortgage banking revenue rose for the fourth straight quarter, more than doubling to $519 million. Cecere said the bank is mindful that the refinancing wave will end. “We are trying to make sure we are hiring in conjunction with our projections and not over hire,” Cecere said. U.S. Bancorp shares rose 1.8 percent to close at $34.20 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.",10172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usbancorp-results/update-2-u-s-bancorp-deposit-growth-outpaces-loans-idUSL3E8LH63E20121017

75,USB,TEXT-S&P; says U.S. Bancorp ratings unaffected by strong Q3 earnings,"Oct 17 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services today said its ratings on U.S. Bancorp  (USB; A+/Stable/A-1) are not affected by the company’s strong third-quarter earnings, which were within our expectations given the current operating conditions.   The company posted pretax earnings of $2.03 billion, up from $1.94 billion the  previous quarter and $1.74 billion the prior year. We expect earnings to  continue to rise in the fourth quarter, largely because of loan growth,  continued strong mortgage banking revenue, and modest reserve releases.   In the third quarter, revenue increased 2.2% from the previous quarter and  8.0% year over year because of an increase in average earning assets and  fee-based income, particularly mortgage banking. Positively, the net interest  margin (NIM) was up 1 basis point from the second quarter to 3.59%, largely as  a result of lower funding costs. We believe that the NIM will decline modestly  in the coming quarter, mainly because of the maturity of higher-yielding  securities. Still, net interest income should increase as a result of higher  average earning assets, particularly ongoing loan growth. Average total loans  rose 1.3% in the third quarter on a sequential basis as USB gained market  share. Loan underwriting standards remained strong, as reflected by an average  weighted loan-to-value ratio of 67% for new retained residential loan  originations.    Standard & Poor’s-adjusted noninterest income rose 1.7% versus the previous  quarter, bolstered by higher mortgage banking revenue. Based on the low rates,  we believe mortgage banking revenue will remain strong, at least through  year-end. Expenses were basically flat relative to the previous quarter, while  operating leverage improved. We expect expenses to rise modestly in the fourth  quarter, though at a slower pace than our projected increase in revenue.   Net charge-offs increased 3.5% from the previous quarter to $538 million.  Excluding new regulatory guidance, which increased net charge-offs by $54  million, net charge-offs would have declined on a quarterly basis. USB  released roughly $50 million in reserves, primarily reflecting improving  credit quality. Notably, allowance to nonperforming loans (excluding covered  loans) was 244% at the end of the third quarter, versus 247% the previous  quarter. Based on declining nonperforming loans, we believe net charge-offs  will decrease modestly in the fourth quarter. We also expect additional modest  reserve releases in the coming quarters.   The company estimates its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio at 8.2%, up 30 basis  points from its previous estimate. Share repurchases and dividends totaled 67%  of earnings in the third quarter. We expect share repurchases and dividends to  comprise up to 60%-80% of USB’s earnings on an ongoing basis. Still, we  believe that USB’s risk-adjusted capital (RAC) ratio, based on our  measurement, will rise modestly to 8.2%-8.7% during the next 12-18 months,  which continues to support the ratings.  The outlook on USB is stable, reflecting our belief that the company will  continue to generate consistent above-peer revenue and earnings and that  credit quality should improve further.",10172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA776720121017

80,USB,UPDATE 6-US stock markets to reopen Wednesday after storm,"* Trade could be volatile after two days of closure * Fiscal year-end for some funds could add to volatility * NYSE, Nasdaq OMX testing trading systems on Tuesday * NYSE could switch to electronic trading if necessary * Sandy delays dozens of U.S. earnings season reports By John McCrank and Sakthi Prasad Oct 30 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock exchanges expect to reopen on Wednesday after Sandy, the worst storm to hit New York in nearly 75 years, closed trading for two days. NYSE Euronext said the New York Stock Exchange would open as usual, although it was prepared to switch to fully electronic trading if necessary. Nasdaq OMX’s Nasdaq Stock Market was also to be operating on Wednesday, as were BATS and Direct Edge Exchanges. “We have a green light,” the chief operating officer of NYSE Euronext, Larry Leibowitz, said in an interview. All of the U.S. stock market operators took part in coordinated testing on Tuesday for trading on NYSE’s backup system, should it need to be used. The exercise was also aimed at allowing member trading firms, many of which are operating on backup systems themselves due to complications from the storm, an opportunity to make sure they are ready for Wednesday. At least 30 people were killed and millions have been left without power after Sandy slammed into the East Coast on Monday. The storm shut down most businesses in Manhattan and caused a rare flooding of the subway tunnels, which is expected to keep the system closed for several days. U.S. exchanges originally had planned to open markets on Monday, but they eventually responded to pressure from firms worried about employee safety, as well as the inability to see markets function effectively at light staffing. It was the first time in 27 years that exchanges closed because of bad weather. Banks, brokers and others conferred for hours on Tuesday about the feasibility of resuming trade. The storm was expected to result in tens of millions of dollars a day in lost revenue for exchanges and banks, analysts said. After two days of closure that occurred during the busy corporate earnings season and at the end of the fiscal year for certain funds, trading is likely to be volatile. “At least in the early trade I expect an overreaction regardless of the direction. I expect to see a lot of volume at least in the first hour,” said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York. The NYSE, which accounts for about a quarter of U.S. stock market trading volume, tested the possibility of routing trades through its electronic platform, Leibowitz said. Under normal conditions it handles about half its volume through its trading floor at 11 Wall Street, where traders and specialists buy and sell stocks in person. Many of NYSE’s member trading firms including the top 25, which make up more than 90 percent of volume on the exchange, took part in the tests, Leibowitz said. “Tomorrow will not be without hiccups, but will be good enough that the market will be fine,” he said. The NYSE had said on Sunday afternoon it planned to close its trading floor and to move all trading to its electronic market. It backtracked on that idea after traders and regulators expressed concern - given the difficulties and low staffing levels due to the storm - about moving everything to the all-electronic venue, a plan tested on March 31 but never used live. An industrywide testing session was held in the morning. Rival exchange Nasdaq also conducted its own tests, as did BATS, the No. 3 U.S. equities exchange. There were some issues at the beginning of the BATS tests, mostly related to members having trouble getting into Manhattan due to flooding and transportation problems, but those issues were resolved by midday, said Chris Isaacson, BATS’ COO. “The majority of our members connected today,” he said. The industry also tested things like volatility trading pauses to handle any abnormal volatility in securities, including NYSE-listed securities, he said. “I expect normal trading tomorrow,” said Isaacson. Bond markets were also closed on Tuesday. Financial industry trade group SIFMA said it is recommending the market reopen on Wednesday. September 2001 was the last extended period of time that exchanges closed. The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq closed on Sept. 11, a Tuesday, after the World Trade Center attacks and did not reopen until six days later, on Sept. 17, the following Monday. “It would be unprecedented to have three days of closure from a weather-related emergency, and the greater point is that American markets do not want to be perceived as anything other than reliable,” said Mike Shea, managing partner and trader at Direct Access Partners LLC in New York. “That’s really the issue. An emergency like Sept. 11 was different.” Kenneth Polcari, long-time floor trader at the NYSE, said he was still waiting to hear how the exchange would get the direct market-makers - the specialists who facilitate buy and sell orders - to the floor. “If they aren’t there and they still trade, then there is no reason for them to have those guys at all,” he said. Leibowitz said there was no plan to end floor trading at NYSE. “We think there is a role for people and judgment and responsibility. Just because you can run with technology alone doesn’t mean it’s the best way to run.” Recent high-profile technical snafus like the glitch that prevented BATS’ market debut on its own exchange, Facebook’s botched IPO on Nasdaq, and Knight Capital Group’s near-fatal trading glitch have increased scrutiny of electronic trading. Nasdaq, BATS and Direct Edge are fully electronic. Plans to resume trading will be complicated by the lingering effect of the storm on New York. Sandy brought a record storm surge that flooded subway tunnels, and subway service is not likely to resume for four to five days, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Tuesday. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the largest U.S. bank, expects many employees will be able to return to buildings starting on Wednesday, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters. One of Citigroup’s main investment banking buildings, at 388 Greenwich Street in Manhattan near the Hudson River, had minor flooding, and was without power, an internal memo said. A smaller Citigroup building also by the Hudson River was running on a generator. The bank expects both to be accessible within two days. Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s offices in Lower Manhattan and Jersey City, New Jersey, on opposite sides of the Hudson River, were not open on Tuesday, and by early afternoon the bank was still not sure whether they would open on Wednesday, after sustaining minor amounts of flooding. Morgan Stanley, whose headquarters is in the less-affected Times Square area, said it expects to be open for business and functioning when U.S. markets open. Both banks had other offices open for employees to work from outside New York City through the hurricane, as well as remote access for many of their staff. When markets do open Wednesday, it could come with a burst of volatility after a two-day shutdown in the middle of earnings season and just days before the Nov. 6 U.S. presidential election. Undoubtedly, some investors will try to game out what sectors and stocks will be helped or hindered by the storm, but the broader economic effect should be limited. “You have earnings, a heavy economic data calendar, the election cycle, it’s a catalyst-rich market sitting idle for a few days and there could be an unusual reaction. We have to get through the first hour and see where the chips fall after that,” said Hogan at Lazard Capital. Some companies, including Pfizer Inc, the largest U.S. drug maker, delayed the release of results until the storm passed, but others released theirs on schedule. Tim Ralph, a money manager at Biltmore Capital in Princeton, New Jersey, said utilities and casino companies will take financial hits from the storm, noting in particular the level of overtime that the utilities will be paying out as they deal with downed lines and power outages. He expects shares of Verizon, Comcast and Consolidated Edison to fall sharply once trading resumes. Brian Gendreau, market strategist with Cetera Financial Group, said markets tend to rebound to their previous levels within five days after natural disasters. “The U.S. is a very big economy, and while the magnitude of this storm could be in the billions it’s actually very small in relation to GDP,” he said.

88,USB,U.S. Bancorp to add to mortgage buy-back reserve in Q4 - CEO,"Dec 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp, the fifth-largest commercial bank in the United States, said Tuesday it would add to its mortgage repurchase reserve in the fourth quarter, as government-backed mortgage financier Freddie Mac steps up buy-back requests. Freddie Mac and its larger peer, Fannie Mae , have been pressing U.S. banks to buy back soured home loans made between 2005 and 2008. The loans had been bundled into mortgage-backed securities and bought by outside investors, who allege they do not meet guarantees made by the banks when they were sold. Freddie Mac informed lenders on Friday that it would begin making repurchase demands on mortgages written in 2004 as well, U.S. Bancorp Chief Executive Richard Davis said at an investor conference in New York. The addition to the reserve will hurt profit by one or two cents per share in the quarter, Davis said. Analysts on average expect the bank to earn 75 cents per share, excluding special items, according to Thomson Reuters   I/B/E/S.

90,USB,TEXT - Fitch says strong mtg banking drives U.S. Bancorp's results,"Jan 16 -  U.S. Bancorp’s (USB) reported fourth quarter 2012 (4Q’12) net income of $1.42 billion, down slightly from the sequential quarter, but up 5.2% from the year-ago quarter, according to Fitch Ratings.  This equated to a very strong 1.62% return on assets (ROA) on the quarter.  Fitch notes that this high level of operating performance continues to be reflective of USB’s strong ratings (long-term IDR of ‘AA-‘), which places USB as one of Fitch’s highest rated banks, globally.  USB’s continued strength in mortgage banking continued to be a large contributor to earnings.  In 4Q’12, USB earned $476 million in mortgage banking income, down slightly from the sequential quarter, but still very strong compared to  historical results.  This was likely due to a mix of higher mortgage  originations from refinancing activities amid the decline in mortgage rates as  well as some larger players having exited the mortgage market.  The growth in mortgage banking also benefited USB’s loan growth compared to both the sequential quarter as well as the year-ago quarter. To wit, in 4Q’12  residential mortgages held on balance sheet increased 5.3% from the sequential  quarter and 19% from the year ago quarter.  In junction with somewhat similar  growth rates in commercial lending, partially offset by reductions in covered  loans, USB’s total loans in 4Q’12 grew 1.5% from the sequential quarter and 6.4% from the year ago quarter.  Fitch views this growth positively.  Fitch notes that USB’s credit quality continues to improve across most lending  categories.  Overall, both the company’s non-performing asset ratio and  net-charge off ratio declined from both the sequential quarter and year-ago  quarter.  While Fitch views this positively, it would also note that as USB’s  new loans begin to season, continued improvement in credit metrics could begin  to abate at some point.  USB’s liquidity continues to be strong with 6.6% sequential growth in attractive non-interest bearing demand deposits and 3.7% sequential growth in savings  deposits, more than offsetting the planned reduction in higher cost certificates of deposits.  This mix shift accompanied by the impact of long-term debt  re-pricing improved the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities by 4 basis  points (bps) to 0.84% in 4Q’12.  This helped partially offset the 9 bps  reduction in asset yields to 4.15%, causing the company’s net interest margin to only marginally decline and remain strong at 3.55% in 4Q’12.  Fitch believes USB’s capital position remains sound despite additional buybacks  and continued dividends.  The company’s Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel I definitions was unchanged at 9% in 4Q’12, and the Tier 1 common equity ratio  using proposed rules for Basel III was also essentially unchanged at 8.1% at  4Q’12.",1162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNB002H620130116

94,USB,TEXT-S&P; rtgs on U.S. Bancorp unaffected by strong Q4 earnings,"Jan 17 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services today said its ratings on U.S. Bancorp  (USB; A+/Stable/A-1) are unaffected by the company’s strong fourth-quarter results, which were in line with our expectations, given the current operating conditions. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2011, adjusted revenue increased 5.7% to $5.06 billion, reflecting higher earning assets and strong mortgage banking revenues. Results include an $80 million charge from the recent mortgage-related regulatory settlement. USB’s net interest margin (NIM) compressed 5 basis points (bps) to 3.55%. We expect the NIM to remain pressured into 2013 because of continued investments in low-yielding securities and the roll-off of higher-yielding securities. Still, net interest income should benefit from ongoing loan growth. Average total loans rose 1.5% from the third quarter and 6.4% year over year, with strong growth in residential real estate loans. In addition, USB achieved positive operating leverage as expenses declined 0.4% versus the previous year. Asset quality continues to improve, with a net charge-off ratio of 0.85%, and allowance to nonperforming loans (excluding covered loans) increased to 269% at the end of the fourth quarter (up from 244% the previous quarter). We believe residential mortgage loan underwriting standards, one of the main causes of loan growth, remain strong, as the average weighted loan-to-value ratio of 65% for new retained residential loan originations demonstrates. USB’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio declined slightly to 8.1% from 8.2% in the previous quarter, likely because of an increase in risk-weighted assets, reflecting USB’s growing balance sheet. Still, the ratio is above management’s target of 8.0%. We believe that USB’s risk-adjusted capital (RAC) ratio, based on our measurement, will rise modestly during the next 12-18 months, which should continue to support the current ratings. Our expectations, based on our calculation for 2013, include maintaining the range of payouts to shareholders of 60%-80% of earnings after the results of the Fed’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) are announced, versus 63% of earnings in 2012. We also envisage a slight increase in net interest income due to loan growth, partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking with declining gain on sale margins, as well as a reduction in qualified borrowers who are able to refinance. The stable rating outlook on USB reflects our expectation that the company will continue to generate above-peer results and that credit quality will experience further, but more modest, improvement, underpinned by conservative underwriting and strong reserve coverage. We expect USB’s quality of earnings to remain good and relatively predictable, with core earnings as the key source, as opposed to large one-time or noncore items such as reserve releases.",1172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWLA0063P20130117

101,USB,Fitch: Lower Expenses Offset Decline in Mortgage Banking to Keep U.S. Bancorp 1Q'13 Results Strong,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 16 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) reported first quarter 2013  (1Q'13) earnings of $1.43 billion, essentially unchanged from the sequential  quarter, but up 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.  These results equated to a  strong 1.65% return on assets (ROA) and 16% return on equity (ROE), which  continue to be near the top of the banking industry. While overall revenue growth remained challenging amid the protracted low  interest rate environment and a slowdown in mortgage banking activity, fewer  expenses particularly related to lower marketing costs, the absence of a  one-time expense, and lower provisioning helped keep USB's results strong.   Fitch expects revenue growth to remain challenging throughout the remainder of  the year, as the tailwind from mortgage banking income which boosted results  last year is likely to slow further as the mortgage market moves from heavy  refinancing activity to a more purchase driven market. Additionally, USB's future revenue will largely be predicated on additional loan  growth.  While Fitch would acknowledge that USB's loan growth has been better  than many peers over the last few years it still remains challenging.  Overall  average loans, including covered loans which are running-off, grew 1% from the  sequential quarter were driven by a 2.3% increase in average commercial loans  and 4.5% in average residential mortgages from the sequential quarter, all  partially offset by lower home equity, credit card, and covered loans. Fitch would note that USB's 4Q'12 earnings showed strong loan demand from  borrowers, which Fitch believes some of which was pulled forward for tax reasons  at the end of the year, which likely helped mute this quarter's growth metrics.   Given USB's strong and low-cost deposit franchise, Fitch believes the company  has the ability to be one of the more aggressive competitors in winning new  business. USB's credit quality continues to improve with total non-performing assets and  net charge offs continuing to decline across most lending categories.  Fitch  continues to view this credit performance positively, though also notes that  credit quality for USB--and across the industry--may be at or near a cyclical  low, so Fitch would expect credit quality metrics to deteriorate over an  intermediate to long term time horizon. Given the slack demand for new loans, USB has been one of the more aggressive  returners of capital to shareholders, having a total payout ratio of nearly 69%  in 1Q'13.  Despite this strategy, the company's capital ratios continue to  remain strong with the Tier 1 common ratio increasing to 11% in 1Q'13, slightly  up from 10.8% in 4Q'12.  Under proposed Basel III rules, USB's Tier 1 common  ratio increased to 8.2% at 1Q'13, up from 8.1% at 4Q'12.

105,USB,Bancorp sued over 'Midwest Madoff' brokerage accounts,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Wednesday launched the first lawsuit against a bank tied to the blow-up of brokerage Peregrine Financial, alleging U.S. Bancorp knowingly let Russell Wasendorf Sr. use customer money held at the bank to fund his lavish lifestyle. Peregrine founder Wasendorf, who has been dubbed ‘the Midwest Madoff’ for his near two-decade long scheme, began serving a 50-year sentence in February for bilking $215 million from customers. The lawsuit, brought by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), alleges a unit of U.S. Bancorp let Wasendorf secure loans and other funding against money it knew belonged to his brokerage’s customers. “(The bank) knowingly facilitated Wasendorf’s transfers of millions of dollars of customers’ funds out of this account to pay for Wasendorf’s private jet, his restaurant, and his divorce settlement, among other things,” the CFTC said in the lawsuit. While former Peregrine clients were hopeful the lawsuit might help make them whole, legal experts said the lawsuit is also the most serious attempt yet by regulators to hold banks responsible for how they monitor customer funds placed with them by brokerages. They cautioned, however, that similar cases have faced a number of steep legal hurdles. U.S. Bancorp spokesman Tom Joyce denied the allegations and said the CFTC case was an attempt to deflect attention from the regulator’s failure to uncover Wasendorf’s abuse of customer funds, which was discovered last summer after he wrote a confessional note prior to a botched suicide attempt. “This lawsuit is without merit and represents an inappropriate attempt to reassign blame to U.S. Bank,” Joyce said. Michael Greenberger, a former director of the CFTC’s trading and markets division, said that whatever the outcome of the case, banks were now on notice that regulators expect them to keep an eye on their brokerage clients. “However this complaint turns out, I think it’s going to be a lesson to depository institutions to take their responsibility seriously when they take in segregated account funds from futures commission merchants,” Greenberger, who now works as a law professor, said. “On its face it seems as if CFTC has a lot of evidence in its hands that go to the merits of this case,” he added. The CFTC complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, alleged U.S. Bank NA, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, accepted customer funds as security on multimillion dollar loans to Wasendorf, his wife and his construction company. “Although the (account) was a customer segregated account containing Peregrine’s customer funds, U.S. Bank ... treated the account as if it were a Peregrine commercial checking account.” The complaint is seeking permanent injunction, civil monetary penalties, and other equitable relief. The revelation of the nearly two-decade long Wasendorf fraud last summer dealt another blow to confidence in the futures industry after the failure of MF Global in late 2011, and drew comparisons with New York money manager Bernard Madoff’s massive Ponzi scheme due to the length of his deception. Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence. The CFTC lawsuit singles out a female employee at the bank’s Cedar Falls, Iowa branch, identified only as ‘Banker A’, for having particularly close dealings with Wasendorf. “Throughout the relevant period, Banker A personally facilitated telephonic and inbranch deposits and wire transfers of Peregrine customer funds,” the CFTC lawsuit said. “Banker A and other U.S. Bank personnel perceived Wasendorf as a successful, desirable bank client with the potential to be a profitable, high growth client.” An earlier investigation into Wasendorf’s fraud by the Berkley Research Group on behalf of the National Futures Association (NFA) named Hope Timmerman as the employee who handled the main Peregrine account at U.S. Bank. Wasendorf Sr. said that he used little more than a rented post office box, Photoshop and ink jet printers to fake bank statements and hide money from regulators for years. He doctored the bank statements to show that accounts held more money than they actually did, while using clients’ money to keep the company afloat and pay for his expensive home, private plane and extensive wine collection. “U.S. Bank allowed Wasendorf to limit access to, and information about, an account holding millions of dollars of Peregrine’s customer funds to only Wasendorf,” the CFTC case said. “Wasendorf was able to represent to the NFA and Peregrine’s auditor that Peregrine maintained a customer segregated account at U.S. Bank that eventually contained more than $200 million, when in fact the average balance since May 2005 was only approximately $15.7 million,” the CFTC case said. Attain Capital chief executive, Jeff Malec, who saw his business drop by 80 percent after it lost money in the Wasendorf fraud, said he had been advising clients not to take buyouts of their claims “until and unless the big pockets in this case, U.S. Bank, is found innocent of any wrongdoing,” he said. “(A successful CFTC case) would be a huge plus for the futures industry in restoring the trust and faith in the customer segregated account structure,” he added. Other Peregrine customers, the majority of whom have received less than one-third of their money back, remained critical of the CFTC. “It was the regulators who allowed all this to go on,” said Joe Berger, who had $100,000 in a Peregrine account when the fraud came to light. “Now regulators riding to my rescue at this date, I don’t have a lot of confidence in them.” Peregrine Financial’s trustee, Ira Bodenstein, is also contemplating a lawsuit against U.S. Bank to recoup customer funds. A lawyer for the trustee, Bob Fishman, said the CFTC lawsuit does not change that. The outcome of the CFTC case could affect separate civil or class-action lawsuits, legal experts said, but they cautioned the case could take many years. A previous attempt by regulators to sue the bank of failed brokerage Sentinel Management Group has been winding its way through the courts for more than five years. But in 2012, JPMorgan paid $20 million to settle with the CFTC over its unlawful handling of customer segregated funds at Lehman Brothers in the wake of the broker-dealer’s collapse during the financial crisis. James Koutoulas, a lawyer and money manager, who co-founded the Commodity Customer Coalition to advocate for former MF Global and Peregrine customers offered cautious optimism on the CFTC suit on Wednesday. “It’s really the first ray of hope that we’ve seen for a while, and it’s a good one,” Koutoulas said of the complaint, describing the CFTC’s case as “pretty damning”. U.S. Bancorp shares fell less than one percent to $35.01 on Wednesday, compared with a 1.69 percent decline in the S&P; financial index.

108,USB,"UPDATE 1-U.S. Bank, partner to refund $6.5 mln over auto lending","By Emily Stephenson WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp’s U.S. Bank and a nonbank partner will refund about $6.5 million to U.S. military personnel over auto lending practices regulators said were deceptive, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said on Thursday. U.S. Bank and its partner, Dealers’ Financial Services of Lexington, Kentucky, failed to properly disclose all of the fees associated with auto loans made through a program targeted at military personnel, the bureau said. The bureau said it would not require either company to pay a civil penalty, in part because they cooperated with the  investigation. Officials said the announcement highlights problems with the military’s so-called allotment system, which allows members to have loan payments deducted directly from their paychecks. Military personnel sometimes wind up paying extra processing fees as a result of this system, and lenders who receive automatic payments may issue loans that are not necessarily affordable, bureau officials said. “Today’s action reflects our determination to act to protect servicemembers against harmful practices in the consumer financial marketplace,” said bureau Director Richard Cordray. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Thursday that his department would form a working group with representatives from enforcement agencies and bank regulators to consider changes to the military’s allotment system. The consumer bureau, which was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, has sought to crack down on what it sees as deceptive marketing of consumer products. The bureau keeps a special eye on products aimed at military personnel. Cordray said problems with this particular program came to light when a Massachusetts resident contacted the bureau. The man said his son, a service member, wound up spending most of his paycheck on loan payments and upkeep after receiving a loan through the program. The bureau examined the Military Installment Loans and Educational Services program, known as MILES. Dealers’ Financial Services marketed the program to servicemembers, recruited car dealers, and processed loan applications. U.S. Bank financed the majority of the program’s loans, the bureau said. However, the bank did not disclose a monthly processing fee or clarify that participants needed to make payments twice a month. Dealers’ Financial Services understated the cost of optional add-on products marketed to borrowers, the bureau said. The companies neither admitted nor denied the bureau’s findings. They agreed to stop deceptive marketing and lending practices and to improve disclosures, the bureau said. U.S. Bank will pay $3.2 million and Dealers’ Financial Services will pay $3.3 million to more than 50,000 members of the armed services who had outstanding loans between January 2010 and now, the CFPB said. The average payment will be just less than $100, said Kent Markus, who heads the consumer bureau’s enforcement division. “We have high expectations for ourselves and our company’s product offerings, and we apologize for any confusion this program may have caused our customers,” U.S. Bank said in a statement. The bank said it intended to exit the MILES program. Dealers’ Financial Services, a subsidiary of financial services company DFC Global Corp, said it was negotiating with potential new lending partners. “DFS is already in the process of modifying its compliance management system and communication procedures with customers to take into account these issues,” said Jeff Weiss, chief executive of DFC Global Corp.",6272013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-auto-usbank/update-1-u-s-bank-partner-to-refund-6-5-mln-over-auto-lending-idUSL2N0F312320130627
109,USB,Fitch: U.S. Bank M&A; Activity Poised to Rise as Market Dynamics Change,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 11 (Fitch) The U.S. banking industry is poised for a potential  rise in M&A; activity over the immediate term, mainly among smaller and  more-regional focused institutions, according to a new Fitch Ratings report.  This report provides a more comprehensive follow up to a Fitch comment on bank  M&A; published July 10.  Fitch believes there is a need for bank M&A; activity based, in part, on  increased cost structures for most banks, the growing economies of scale that  will benefit larger institutions, and the desire to grow into new geographic  markets and lending products.  Furthermore, intense loan origination competition is currently plaguing the  industry. An increase in acquisition activity will remove some industry  capacity, which Fitch views positively as too many banks are chasing too few  lending opportunities.  Catalysts have begun to emerge that will bring an increase in activity over the  intermediate term. These include:  --Higher stock market values, particularly for healthy institutions; --Strategic focus on growing loans potentially via acquisition; --Emphasis on mitigating potential interest rate risk; --Belief that sufficient scale now matters more due to higher regulatory and  compliance costs; --Fatigue on the part of bank management and boards at potential sellers. From a credit perspective, Fitch's views on potential acquisitions typically  focus on the level and depth of due diligence done by the acquiring institution,  the acquirers knowledge of the target market, the pro forma composition of the  loan and securities portfolios, the pro forma capital ratios of the combined  entity, as well as the ability to integrate and realize estimated cost savings  from potential transactions. Fitch also views prices paid for acquisitions,  terms and type of financing, strategic rationale, as well as cultural fit of  some institutions as potentially affecting ratings.

110,USB,CFTC asks court not to dismiss suit against U.S. Bancorp unit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday asked a federal court not to dismiss their lawsuit against a bank tied to the blow-up of brokerage Peregrine Financial, saying the bank helped bring about millions of dollars of losses for Peregrine customers. At issue is a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission in June against U.S. Bank N.A., a unit of U.S. Bancorp, based in Minneapolis. The lawsuit accused the bank of letting Peregrine founder Russell Wasendorf Sr secure loans against money that belonged to his brokerage’s customers. The lawsuit was the first against a bank tied to the collapse of Peregrine, which filed for bankruptcy protection in July 2012 after Wasendorf confessed to bilking his clients of more than $100 million in a nearly 20-year-long fraud. Wasendorf began serving a 50-year sentence in February. Attorneys for U.S. Bank filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit earlier this month, saying the CFTC was trying to shift responsibility for a Ponzi scheme to the bank, even though the bank itself was a victim of the scheme. Attorneys for U.S. Bank could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday. In a response to the lawsuit in June, U.S. Bancorp spokesman Tom Joyce denied the allegations and said the lawsuit was “an inappropriate attempt to reassign blame to U.S. Bank.” In its lawsuit, the CFTC said the bank knowingly facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars of customer funds to pay for Wasendorf’s private jet, his restaurant and his divorce settlement, among other things. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, said the bank had a segregated account for Peregrine’s customer funds but treated the account as if it were “a Peregrine commercial checking account.” In a court filing on Thursday, the CFTC said more than $325 million flowed through the segregated customer account between May 2005 and June 2012, and that Wasendorf misappropriated about $215 million of that amount. U.S. Bank knew the account held customer funds but executed withdrawals on Wasendorf’s behalf anyway, the CFTC said. Restitution is appropriate because the customer losses would not have occurred if the bank had not executed the withdrawals, the CFTC said.

113,USB,U.S. Bancorp lowers long-term growth forecast-WSJ,"Sept 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp reduced its long-term revenue and income growth forecast, citing a slump in mortgage activity as interest rates rise, the Wall Street Journal reported. Mortgage applications in the third quarter are down 40 percent from the end of June, said Andrew Cecere, the chief financial officer of the Minneapolis-based bank, during an investor presentation in New York on Thursday.

123,USB,Fitch: Operational RWA New Twist in Regulating US Bank Capital,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 25 (Fitch) The Federal Reserve's move to allow the use of  Basel III advanced approaches in the calculation of large banks' risk-based  capital will give some institutions more flexibility in meeting capital targets.  But Fitch Ratings sees accompanying increases in operational risk-weighted  assets (RWA) as an additional tool for U.S. bank regulators to use in  supervising capital levels in the industry. The Fed, together with the OCC, announced on Feb. 21 that certain large banks  would be allowed to begin using the advanced approaches methodology (i.e. using  internal models to estimate RWA) in computing regulatory capital levels,  effective second-quarter 2014. This is an important development, as U.S. banks  under the Basel III's advanced approaches have invested heavily to develop the  necessary data and methodologies to calculate risk-weighted assets. On Feb. 21, Citigroup noted in a press release that, as part of the agreement  with the Fed concerning use of the new risk-based capital approach, the bank  would be required to increase the level of RWA associated with operational risk  to $288 billion, compared with $232 billion at year-end 2013. As a result, its  pro forma Tier 1 common (T1C) capital ratio under Basel III fell by  approximately 40 bps to 10.1%, though still above its newly revised Basel III  T1C target of 9.5%.  This followed earlier additions to operational RWA in fourth-quarter 2013  announced by both JP Morgan and Citigroup. JP Morgan noted in its Investor Day  presentation today that its operational risk capital was $30 billion at year-end  2013, which equates to $375 billion of RWA. Recent additions to operational risk  capital had a negative 50 bps impact on T1C in fourth-quarter 2013. A shift to the use of advanced approaches in regulatory capital calculations is  positive for Citigroup and the other approved institutions such as JP Morgan,  Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street Financial,  US Bank, and Northern Trust. Fitch views the approval for these banks favorably  as it suggests the regulators believe the data and internal risk-weighting  methodologies are sufficient for these banks. However, we see the required changes in operational RWA as a reflection of  regulators' desire to respond to changing industry conditions by altering  operational risk assumptions when needed. Operational risk is a developing risk  within the regulatory framework, and likely will receive more attention over the  near-term due to recent events and losses. This contributes to the continuing  theme of regulatory uncertainty for the industry. The Fed also pushed back the date these institutions would be required to  incorporate the advanced approach methodologies into the annual capital planning  and stress testing, now beginning Oct. 1, 2015, providing them additional time  to integrate the advanced approach frameworks into capital planning and stress  testing.

125,USB,Creditors to vote on Momentive's contentious restructuring plan,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday gave Momentive Performance Materials the go-ahead to send its restructuring plan to creditors for a vote, but criticized a rights offering at the center of the plan over bloated fees for its backstoppers. Judge Robert Drain, at a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., told the quartz and silicone maker to reduce the $30 million fee to a bondholder group that includes Apollo Global Management for its agreement to guarantee the $600 million rights offering.  Momentive went bankrupt in April with a plan to cut about $3 billion of its $4 billion debt load. The plan would pay off senior bondholders and transfer control of the company to second-lien bondholders, including Apollo, through their sponsorship of the equity rights offering.  Other creditors cried foul at Thursday’s hearing, calling the offering a ploy by Apollo to keep control of Momentive, since Apollo holds both current equity and a big chunk of the bonds that would acquire Momentive’s post-bankruptcy equity.  Apollo needs no extra incentive to take the deal, so the fee is unnecessary, the creditors argued.  Drain agreed the $30 million figure seemed too high, especially because only a small percentage of the offering figures to be unsubscribed and require backstopping.  Momentive hopes to secure creditor support for its plan and go back to Drain for final approval in August or September, but it faces widespread opposition. The vehemence over the fee - a drop in the bucket in the scope of Momentive’s capital structure - illustrates the contentious nature of a case in which most creditors believe the Apollo group is receiving a sweetheart deal at the expense of recoveries for other stakeholders.     Senior creditors led by Wilmington Trust [WLMTN.UL] and Bank of Oklahoma, despite being slated to receive full payback, object to the plan because they would not receive extra premiums known as make-whole payments they feel they are owed for refinancing their bonds. Meanwhile, lower-priority bondholders led by U.S. Bank [USBUB.UL] would recover nothing despite their insistence that they are contractually equal to the Apollo-led second-lien group.  Lawsuits are pending on both issues, which depending on their outcomes could unravel Momentive’s restructuring proposal. Even within the second-lien bond group, discord rears its head. Fortress Investment Group said it was unfairly excluded from the backstop agreement despite being a large holder of the second-lien debt, and that its calls to the company offering a cheaper backstop agreement for a smaller piece of the rights offering were not returned.

130,USB,Mazda recalls U.S. cars with faulty Takata air bags,"(Reuters) - Japan’s Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T)(MZDAY.PK) will broaden a recall of cars sold in the United States because an air-bag inflator, supplied by Japan’s Takata Corp 7312.T, could rupture and seriously injure occupants. The issue of ruptured inflators - which can hurl metal shrapnel at vehicle occupants - has bedeviled Takata and triggered the recall of millions of vehicles last year. The company supplied the parts to at least nine global automakers. The recalls were expanded this year as issues cropped up in newer models equipped with Takata air bags and inflators.  In a filing Friday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Mazda said it would recall about 18,000 older models, including 18,000 Mazda6 sedans and 50 RX-8 sports cars from 2003-2004. NHTSA said the inflator could rupture, “with metal fragments striking and potentially seriously injuring” occupants.     Mazda dealers will replace for free the passenger-side air bag inflator, beginning in August. The U.S. recall is part of a global recall of nearly 160,000 vehicles for similar issues announced by Mazda on June 23. Indeed, over the past five years, about 12 million vehicles equipped with Takata air bags have been recalled around the world for similar issues. Last week, German automaker BMW said it would recall another 1.6 million cars with Takata air bags because of the risk of injury from inflators that could rupture.  In two separate actions Friday, NHTSA said it had opened investigations into cars made by Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and Chrysler Group FIA.MI. NHTSA said it was investigating nearly 400,000 2006-2006 Hyundai Sonata sedans after receiving complaints that the seat belt buckle assembly had failed. The safety agency said the problem could cause air bags to fail in a crash. It was also investigating about 123,000 2011-2012 Dodge Chargers over complaints about engines stalling and alternator failure.

140,USB,US Bank to pay $57 million over 'add-on' products,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. financial regulators said on Thursday that US Bank will pay about $57 million to resolve allegations it charged consumers for services they did not actually receive. The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the bank, a unit of US Bancorp, would pay a total of $9 million in fines and about $48 million in restitution to harmed borrowers. The bank offered identity theft protection and credit monitoring services as “add-ons” to mortgages and checking accounts. Some borrowers were billed for the services even though they never activated them, and some paid for the products for years without receiving any benefits, regulators said. Bank regulators have been cracking down on marketing and billing practices tied to these extra products. The consumer bureau said it has taken seven enforcement actions involving such products, including fines against Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Discover. “We have consistently warned companies about practices related to add-on products and we will do what is necessary to prevent further harm to consumers,” CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement on Thursday. US Bank neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Regulators said the add-on products were marketed by US Bank and sold by a third-party vendor. Dana Ripley, a spokesman for the bank, said US Bank ended its relationship with the vendor, Affinion Group, two years ago. “We will be compensating customers who did not receive full services from Affinion, and providing our apology,” Ripley said. Michael Bush, a spokesman for Affinion Group, said the problem was related to a requirement that consumers submit authenticating information before they could receive the service. Some consumers never provided that information but were billed anyway, the CFPB said. “We proactively built and implemented a solution over two years ago to obtain the required authorizations upon enrollment to our service,” Bush said on Thursday.  Affinion also provided services to Capital One Financial, which was fined in 2012 by financial regulators over add-on products.

145,USB,Fitch Affirms U.S. Bancorp's Ratings at 'AA-' Following Large Regional Bank Review; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed U.S. Bancorp's (USB)  ratings at 'AA-/F1+'.  The Rating Outlook remains Stable.   The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T; Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T; Bank Corporation (MTB), PNC Financial Services  Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US  Bancorp (USB), UnionBanCal Corporation (UBC), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and  Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VIABILITY RATINGS (VR) AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of USB's ratings is reflective of an institution that for  several years now has set itself apart from peer institutions due to its  continued out-performance through the credit crisis and subsequently, which is  now focused on furthering its advantages relative to peers. USB's strong ratings are the result of a number of competitive advantages and a  conservative and strong core culture, which have led to better earnings and  credit performance than nearly all peer banks over multiple operating cycles. The company's key competitive advantage is its low-cost deposit base, which  allows USB to profitably lower loan prices to win new business.  This is  important because it brings new banking relationships into the bank, to which  the company can then aggressively cross-sell other services.  To the extent this  cross-sell is successful creates a virtuous cycle in that it fosters much  stickier customer relationships, which in turn allow the company to keep deposit  costs low, which can attract even more customers to the bank. In addition to its deposit cost advantage, USB has an operating cost advantage  as well.  It routinely has an efficiency ratio in the low 50's, better than most  peer institutions, which largely helps to support the company's superior  earnings performance.  As an example, if USB's efficiency ratio was closer to  industry averages, its return on assets (ROA) would also be closer to industry  averages. USB complements its core cost advantages with a loan portfolio that is well  balanced between commercial and consumer assets.  Similar to the loan portfolio,  the company's earnings are also nearly evenly balanced between net interest  income (NII) and non-interest income. In this latter category, USB has a leading market share in corporate trust, has  increased its mortgage banking market share as others retrenched in the wake of  the financial crisis, has a leading and scalable payments and merchant  processing business, and is focused on growing its wealth management offerings. Finally, underpinning all of these advantages is a management team that  continuously makes strategic and smart operating decisions and that is  responsible for helping to create and sustain the company's core operating  culture.  Fitch views USB's management team as one of, if not the best, in the  industry. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT USB's ratings remain at the very high end of their potential rating range, and  there is very minimal upside to current ratings from this level. Downward pressure on ratings, while not expected, could result from a number of  factors.  While Fitch would expect some deterioration in credit metrics for USB  - as well as the rest of the industry - given today's benign credit environment,  should USB's metrics deteriorate at a rate faster than peer group averages there  could be pressure on ratings. Additionally, should USB's earnings performance begin to match peer levels  rather than consistently exceed them, this could impact ratings over time. While Fitch views USB's interest rate risk positioning as neutral, which Fitch  views positively from a credit perspective, should the company's performance be  negatively affected by a rising rate environment, this could also impact ratings  negatively. Finally, given that management is a key component in Fitch's analysis and views  of the company, should there be any significant management changes, a negative  rating action could follow. That said, Fitch does not view this, or any of the other potential negative  rating factors as likely. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   USB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should USB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, trouble  accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to meet  near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the holding  company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is viewed  as unlikely for USB, though, given the strength of the holding company liquidity  profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that USB may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be affected as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  USB has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, USB is not systemically important and, therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  USB's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption as to capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by USB and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from USB or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by USB and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in USB's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of USB's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of its main  subsidiary banks are equalized across the group.  The IDRs and VRs of USB's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized  with USB's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to USB's  business strategy and financial profile. For USB this mainly includes its Elavon  Financial Services entity based in Ireland.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalised with those of USB to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in USB's IDRs.  To the extent that one of USB's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from USB's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS USB's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  USB's uninsured deposits outside of the U.S. do not benefit from rating uplift  because they do not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference unless  the deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the United States.  Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually  payable, they do not get the rating uplift. KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by USB and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in USB's long- and short-term IDRs.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: U.S. Bancorp --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable --Viability Rating at 'aa-'; --Senior debt at 'AA-'; --Subordinated Debt at 'A+'; --Preferred Stock to at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1+'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.

148,USB,Fitch: U.S. Bancorp's 3Q'14 Earnings Remain Good,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 22 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) third quarter earnings remained  good as the company's return on average assets (ROA) clocked in at 1.51% and  return on average equity (ROE) was 14.5%, according to Fitch Ratings.  While  Fitch views these results as solid, it would note that both the ROA and ROE are  down from the sequential and year-ago quarters.  Though net income remained  relatively stable, higher average assets and higher levels of equity impacted  the denominator of both metrics.  This was largely due to the completion of the  acquisition of Charter One's deposit franchise in Chicago in late second quarter  2014 (2Q'14), which is now fully reflected in results. USB's net interest income (NII) was essentially flat from both the sequential  and year-ago quarters.  This was due to some asset growth with the  aforementioned Charter One deposit acquisition.  Given that these deposits were  generally placed in the securities portfolio and likely the securities portfolio  mix shifted more towards comparatively lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities  and securities backed by Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loans  for Liquidity Coverage Rule (LCR) reasons, the company's net interest margin  (NIM) declined. The NIM came it at 3.16% in 3Q'14 down 11 basis points (bps) from the sequential  quarter and 27 bps from the year ago quarter.  Fitch would expect USB's NIM to  continue to compress given the persistently low interest rate environment. USB's non-interest income declined relative to the sequential quarter due to a  gain on the sale of stock in Visa, Inc. (V) in 2Q'14 impacting the sequential  quarter comparisons.  Also contributing to the sequential quarter decline was  lower mortgage banking revenue, lower commercial products revenue, and lower  credit and debit card revenue, partially offset by increases in corporate  payments and higher deposit service charges.  Relative to the year ago quarter,  non-interest income grew 3% due largely to higher trust and investment  management fees and higher merchant processing revenue offset by lower mortgage  banking income. Expenses declined relative to the sequential quarter as 2Q'14 included a  settlement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) due to mortgage related matters.  Also contributing to the expense decline was an 18.8% reduction in marketing and  business development expenses.  Relative to the year-ago quarter, USB's expenses  were only 1.9% higher.  Fitch continues to view USB's expense management  favorably, and notes that the company's efficiency ratio remained strong at  52.4% in 3Q'14. Credit quality for USB--as well as the rest of the industry--continues to  improve, although the improvements are becoming comparatively more modest.   Given this, USB had an effective reserve release this quarter as provision  expense was lower than net charge-offs (NCOs) by $25 million. Fitch continues to expect some reversion in asset quality metrics for USB, as  well as the rest of the industry.  In Fitch's view, this will be likely due to  continued seasoning of loan portfolios as well as borrowers having potentially  more sensitivity to interest rates should they eventually rise. USB's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  standardized approach (USB's binding constraint) improved to 9% in 3Q'14, up  from 8.9% in the sequential quarter despite the company returning 78% of  earnings to owners via buybacks and dividends during the quarter.

150,USB,"Americans face post-foreclosure hell as wages garnished, assets seized","NEW YORK (Reuters) - (This corrects paragraph 28 to show financial institutions in Maryland have 27 years, not 36, to collect deficiency judgments) Many thousands of Americans who lost their homes in the housing bust, but have since begun to rebuild their finances, are suddenly facing a new foreclosure nightmare: debt collectors are chasing them down for the money they still owe by freezing their bank accounts, garnishing their wages and seizing their assets.     By now, banks have usually sold the houses. But the proceeds of those sales were often not enough to cover the amount of the loan, plus penalties, legal bills and fees. The two big government-controlled housing finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as other mortgage players, are increasingly pressing borrowers to pay whatever they still owe on mortgages they defaulted on years ago.      Using a legal tool known as a “deficiency judgment,” lenders can ensure that borrowers are haunted by these zombie-like debts for years, and sometimes decades, to come. Before the housing bubble, banks often refrained from seeking deficiency judgments, which were seen as costly and an invitation for bad publicity. Some of the biggest banks still feel that way.      But the housing crisis saddled lenders with more than $1 trillion of foreclosed loans, leading to unprecedented losses. Now, at least some large lenders want their money back, and they figure it’s the perfect time to pursue borrowers: many of those who went through foreclosure have gotten new jobs, paid off old debts and even, in some cases, bought new homes.      “Just because they don’t have the money to pay the entire mortgage, doesn’t mean they don’t have enough for a deficiency judgment,” said Florida foreclosure defense attorney Michael Wayslik.      Advocates for the banks say that the former homeowners ought to pay what they owe. Consumer advocates counter that deficiency judgments blast those who have just recovered from financial collapse back into debt — and that the banks bear culpability because they made the unsustainable loans in the first place.     Borrowers are usually astonished to find out they still owe thousands of dollars on homes they haven’t thought about for years.  In 2008, bank teller Danell Huthsing broke up with her boyfriend and moved out of the concrete bungalow they shared in Jacksonville, Florida. Her name was on the mortgage even after she moved out, and when her boyfriend defaulted on the loan, her name was on the foreclosure papers, too.      She moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where she managed to amass $20,000 of savings and restore her previously stellar credit score in her job as a service worker at an Amtrak station.       But on July 5, a process server showed up on her doorstep with a lawsuit demanding $91,000 for the portion of her mortgage that was still unpaid after the home was foreclosed and sold. If she loses, the debt collector that filed the suit can freeze her bank account, garnish up to 25 percent of her wages, and seize her paid-off 2005 Honda Accord.     “For seven years you think you’re good to go, that you’ve put this behind you,” said Huthsing, who cleared her savings out of the bank and stowed the money in a safe to protect it from getting seized. “Then wham, you get slapped to the floor again.”     Bankruptcy is one way out for consumers in this rub. But it has serious drawbacks: it can trash a consumer’s credit report for up to ten years, making it difficult to get credit cards, car loans or home financing. Oftentimes, borrowers will instead go on a repayment plan or simply settle the suits — without questioning the filings or hiring a lawyer — in exchange for paying a lower amount. Though court officials and attorneys in foreclosure-ravaged regions like Florida, Ohio and Illinois all say the cases are surging, no one keeps official tabs on the number nationally. “Statistically, this is a real difficult task to get a handle on,” said Geoff Walsh, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center.       Officials in individual counties say that the cases, while virtually zero a year or two ago, now number in the hundreds in each county. Thirty-eight states, along with the District of Columbia, allow financial institutions recourse to claw back these funds.      “I’ve definitely noticed a huge uptick,” said Cook County, Illinois homeowner attorney Sandra Emerson. “They didn’t include language in court motions to pursue these. Now, they do.”     Three of the biggest mortgage lenders, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co., all say that they typically don’t pursue deficiency judgments, though they reserve the right to do so. “We may pursue them on a case-by-case basis looking at a variety of factors, including investor and mortgage insurer requirements, the financial status of the borrower and the type of hardship,” said Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda. The banks would not comment on why they avoid deficiency judgments.     Perhaps the most aggressive among the debt pursuers is Fannie Mae. Of the 595,128 foreclosures Fannie Mae was involved in – either through owning or guaranteeing the loans - from January 2010 through June 2012, it referred 293,134 to debt collectors for possible pursuit of deficiency judgments, according to a 2013 report by the Inspector General for the agency’s regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency.      It is unclear how many of the loans that get sent to debt collectors actually get deficiency judgments, but the IG urged the FHFA to direct Fannie Mae, along with Freddie Mac, to pursue more of them from the people who could repay them.      It appears as if Fannie Mae is doing just that. In Florida alone in the past year, for example, at least 10,000 lawsuits have been filed — representing hundreds of millions of dollars of payments, according to Jacksonville, Florida-based attorney Chip Parker.      Parker is about to file a class action lawsuit against the Dallas-based debt collection company, Dyck O’Neal, which is working to recoup the money on behalf of Fannie Mae. The class action will allege that Dyck O’Neal violated fair debt collection practices by suing people in the state of Florida who actually lived out of state. Dyck O’Neal declined to comment.      In Lee County, Florida, for example, Dyck O’Neal only filed four foreclosure-related deficiency judgment cases last year. So far this year, it has filed 360 in the county, which has more than 650,000 residents and includes Ft. Myers. The insurer the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Company has also filed about 1,000 cases this past year in Florida alone.     Andrew Wilson, a spokesman for Fannie Mae, said the finance giant is focusing on “strategic defaulters:” those who could have paid their mortgages but did not. Fannie Mae analyzes borrowers’ ability to repay based on their open credit lines, assets, income, expenses, credit history, mortgages and properties, according to the 2013 IG report.  “Fannie Mae and the taxpayers suffered a loss. We’re focusing on people who had the ability to make a payment but decided not to do so,” said Wilson.      Freddie Mac spokesman Brad German said the decision to pursue deficiency judgments for any particular loan is made on a “case-by-case basis.” The FHFA declined to comment.     But homeowner-defense lawyers point out that separating strategic defaulters from those who were in real distress can be tricky. If a distressed borrower suddenly manages to improve their financial position – by, for example, getting a better-paying job - they can be classified as a strategic defaulter.     Dyck O’Neal works with most national lenders and servicing companies to collect on charged-off residential real estate. It purchases foreclosure debts outright, often for pennies on the dollar, and also performs collections on a contingency basis on behalf of entities like Fannie Mae. “The debt collectors tend to be much more aggressive than the lenders had been,” the National Consumer Law Center’s Walsh said.    A big reason for the new surge in deficiency claims, attorneys say, is that states like Florida have recently enacted laws limiting the time financial institutions have to sue for the debt after a foreclosure. In Florida, for example, financial institutions now only have a year after a foreclosure sale to sue — down from five.     Once financial institutions secure a judgment, they can sometimes have years to collect on the claim. In Maryland, for example, they have as long as 27 years to chase people down for the debt. Financial institutions can charge post-judgment interest of an estimated 4.75 percent a year on the remaining balance until the statute of limitation runs out, which can drive people deeper into debt.       “This is monumentally unfair and damaging to the economy,” said Ira Rheingold, the executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. “It prevents people from moving forward with their lives.”      Software developer Doug Weinberg was just getting back on his feet when he got served in July with a $61,000 deficiency judgment on his old condo in Miami’s Biscayne Bay. Weinberg thought the ordeal was over after Bank of America, which rejected Weinberg’s short sale offers, foreclosed in 2009.      “It’s a curse,” said Weinberg. “It’s still haunting me. It just doesn’t go away.” ",10302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-housing-foreclosures-insight/americans-face-post-foreclosure-hell-as-wages-garnished-assets-seized-idUSKCN0I30BU20141030
151,USB,U.S. Bank must face restitution claims in Peregrine lawsuit: judge,"(Reuters) - U.S. Bank, sued by the government last year for allegedly aiding a massive fraud at brokerage Peregrine Financial, must face claims for nearly $36 million in restitution to Peregrine’s victims, a federal judge in Iowa ruled. Judge Linda Reade on Wednesday rejected the bank’s argument that restitution should be sought from the person who committed the fraud, Peregrine founder Russell Wasendorf Sr., and not from the bank. U.S. Bank, part of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, was sued last year by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for allegedly letting Wasendorf treat an account set up for Peregrine customer funds like his “personal piggy bank.” The lawsuit was the government’s first against a bank tied to the collapse of Peregrine and a nearly two-decade-long fraud at the futures brokerage. Wasendorf began serving a 50-year sentence last year after pleading guilty to embezzling more than $215 million from thousands of customers. The CFTC has estimated the bank’s alleged misconduct caused nearly $36 million in losses. Teri Charest, a spokeswoman for U.S. Bank, said the bank did nothing wrong and would defend itself vigorously. “We did not know about the Peregrine Ponzi scheme and in fact we were a victim of the same scheme,” she said.  A spokesman for the CFTC declined to comment. In her order, Reade also ruled that U.S. Bank cannot escape the CFTC’s lawsuit based on its argument that the commission failed to detect the fraud. In court filings, the bank had argued that the CFTC had “unclean hands” in the case because it found warning signs during a 1999 audit and took no action against Peregrine. “Although the 1999 CFTC audit should have led the CFTC to monitor Wasendorf’s activities more closely,” its failure to detect the fraud should not prevent it from pursing an enforcement action, Reade said. The order came on motions by both sides for a judgment in their favor as a matter of law before the case goes to trial. The case is set for trial early next year. While limiting U.S. Bank’s defense, Reade ruled that other issues, such as whether the bank acted in bad faith, are best left to a jury.

158,USB,"UPDATE 2-U.S. Bank, Bank of America sued over mortgage securities","(Adds Bank of America declines to comment) By Emily Stephenson WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. credit union regulator said on Wednesday it filed a lawsuit against U.S. Bank  and Bank of America over mortgage securities sold in the years leading up to the financial crisis. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) said the banks broke state and federal laws by failing their duties as trustees for 99 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts. The banks sold $5.8 billion in securities to five corporate credit unions that later failed after the products lost value. The regulator accused U.S. Bank and Bank of America of knowing about defects in the mortgage loans but not providing required notices to the investors. “U.S. Bank and Bank of America had obligations under federal and state law, and they failed to live up to those obligations,” NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz said in a statement. “Our legal efforts are aimed at promoting accountability within the financial system,” she said. Spokesmen for U.S. Bank and Bank of America declined to comment on the lawsuit. U.S. regulators have been cracking down on banks for their behavior during the years leading to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when mortgages went bad and investors in securities tied to those loans lost money. The credit union regulator last year filed nine lawsuits against banks, including Morgan Stanley and Barclays , over mortgage securities sold to some of the same corporate credit unions. Corporate credit unions are owned by and provide services to consumer-owned credit unions. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

160,USB,U.S. Bancorp unit settles lawsuit over role as trustee,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Bank has agreed to pay $6 million to settle an investor lawsuit that accused the U.S. Bancorp unit of violating its duties as a trustee for mortgage-backed securities that were sold by Bear Stearns before the 2008 financial crisis. The settlement was disclosed in papers filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan and requires court approval. Several big banks acted as trustees for mortgage-backed securities in the real estate bubble of a decade ago. In the aftermath of the crisis that ensued, they have denied their responsibilities made them liable for losses. The proposed class action against U.S. Bank was filed on behalf of the Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System and other investors who bought Bear Stearns mortgage-backed securities for which U.S. Bank acted as trustee. The settlement is the second in recent months resolving complaints about the bank’s trustee role. In November, U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America Corp  reached a $69 million settlement in a lawsuit over their alleged failure to protect investors from losses in securities backed by Washington Mutual Inc mortgages. The banks denied liability. Plaintiffs’ lawyers had said the November settlement was the first of its kind in a class action challenging the conduct of trustees for residential mortgage-backed securities. Hurt by heavy losses on residential mortgages, Washington Mutual failed in 2008, while Bear Stearns was acquired that year by JPMorgan Chase & Co in a rescue engineered by the U.S. government.

Filed in 2011, the Oklahoma lawsuit accused U.S. Bank of breach of contract and numerous violations of the 1939 U.S. Trust Indenture Act, which sets out duties of trustees. According to the lawsuit, the bank regularly disregarded its duty to review loan files to ensure there were no missing or incomplete documents and to see that any defective loans were removed from the pools supporting the mortgage-backed bonds.

165,USB,Fitch: Strong Loan Growth Evident in U.S. Bancorp's Fourth Quarter Earnings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 21 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) fourth quarter 2014 (4Q'14)  earnings remained strong, according to Fitch Ratings.  The company's 4Q return  on average assets (ROA) was good at 1.50%, essentially unchanged from the  sequential quarter but down from 1.62% in the year-ago quarter.  Similarly the  company's return on average equity (ROE) was 14.4% in 4Q'14, essentially  unchanged from the sequential quarter, but down from 15.4% in the year-ago  quarter.  Nevertheless, Fitch continues to consider USB's earnings performance  to be near the top of the banking industry and supportive of Fitch's high  ratings on the company. A bright spot in USB's 4Q'14 earnings, in Fitch's view, was good loan growth.   USB's total loans, excluding covered loans which continue to run-off, grew 1.2%  from the sequential quarter but a strong 7.2% from the prior-year's quarter.  This year-over-year increase was largely due to good growth in commercial loans,  construction and development loans, residential mortgages, and credit card  balances.   Fitch believes that USB was able to win new lending commitments because of its  cost advantages, including both low deposit and operating costs, which allow it  to profitably lower prices to win new relationships and maintain renewal  business.  Further, Fitch believes that over time USB can enhance the  profitability of these relationships through aggressive cross-selling of some of  its complementary products for clients.  Fitch notes that the credit quality of USB - as well as the rest of the banking  industry - continues to be at or near a cyclical trough.  As such, the company's  total net charge-offs (NCO) declined to $308 million in 4Q'14, down from $336  million in 3Q'13, and $312 million in 4Q'13.  Given this, the company had an  effective reserve release as provision was $20 million less than NCOs. This declining provision expense, coupled with good non-interest income growth  and relatively flat net-interest income offset some higher non-interest expense  particularly relative to the year-ago quarter.  Growth in non-interest income,  particularly relative to the prior-year's quarter, was driven largely by higher  trust and investment management fees and higher investment product fees, both of  which helped offset lower mortgage banking income. USB's net interest income increased modestly, as higher levels of earning assets  offset some continued margin compression.  As of 4Q'14, USB's net interest  margin (NIM) declined to 3.14%, down 2 basis points (bps) from the sequential  quarter, and 26 bps from the year-ago quarter.  Fitch would expect continued  margin compression until short-term rates eventually rise. A low-cost operating model continues to be a hallmark of USB's franchise.   Despite some growth in overall expenses, particularly in professional services  as well as marketing and business development, the company's efficiency ratio  remained good, in Fitch's opinion, at 54.3% in 4Q'14.  Fitch would expect some  continued expense growth in the next year.  If short-term interest rates  increase in 2015, which would boost revenue, Fitch would expect USB to deliver  positive operating leverage; if rates do not increase it may be slightly more  challenging. USB did have some one-time items in 4Q'14 which largely offset each other.  This  includes a gain on its investment in Nuveen Investments, partially offset by $35  million of expense related to charitable contributions and $53 million of  incremental legal expense. Given USB's strong capital generation, Fitch considers the company's capital  ratios to be adequate for its rating category.  As of 4Q'14, USB's fully  phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the standardized  approach was 9%. Fitch also notes that USB is in compliance with the fully implemented Liquidity  Coverage Ratio (LCR), which was enhanced over the last year with the build of  High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in the company's securities portfolio. There was also one management change for USB, which coincided with the quarterly  results.  Andy Cercere, formerly Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has assumed the  role of Chief Operating Officer (COO).  The new CFO is Kathy Rogers, who, Fitch  would note, has a long tenure at the company.  Fitch would expect this  transition to be seamless and consistent with longer-term succession planning.

Prosecutors said Peregrine, which was also known as PFGBest, collapsed after Wasendorf stole roughly $215 million from more than 13,000 victims over nearly 20 years, covering his tracks by forging bank statements and submitting false regulatory reports. The CFTC said about $36 million of the funds misappropriated by Wasendorf came from a U.S. Bank NA account. Peregrine had been based in Cedar Falls, Iowa. U.S. Bancorp did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. “Like PFG’s customers, U.S. Bank was subject to this sophisticated fraudulent scheme masterminded by PFG’s CEO,” bank spokesman Dana Ripley said.

180,USB,Fitch:  Continued Good Performance For U.S. Bancorp in 1Q'15,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 15 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp continued to deliver good performance in  the first quarter of 2015 (1Q'15) with a return on average assets (ROAA) of  1.44% and a return on average equity (ROAE) of 14.1%.  Fitch considers these  results to be strong and believes them to be near the top of the banking  industry, though also notes that these were modestly lower performance numbers  than in the sequential or year-ago quarters. Relative to the sequential quarter, this slight performance decline was due to  revenue which was modestly lower than expense reductions as well as a modestly  lower benefit from reserve releases.  Relative to the year-ago quarter, the  slight performance decline was due to expense growth outpacing revenue growth,  and again a modestly lower benefit from reserve releases. However, in Fitch's view, the main bright spot in USB's 1Q'15 earnings was its   loan growth. Relative to the year-ago quarter, total average loans (excluding  covered loans) grew a strong 6.7%.  This was driven by commercial construction  and development lending partially offset by a slight contraction in retail  leasing and residential mortgages.  On a sequential basis, USB's total average  loans (excluding covered loans) grew 1.3%. In addition, USB also made solid new lending commitments during 1Q'15, including  $29 billion of new and renewed commercial and commercial real estate  commitments.  Fitch continues to note that it believes USB's strong loan growth,  particularly compared to other large banking institutions, is due to its cost  competitive advantages, which allow it to profitably lower loan prices to win  new relationships and maintain renewal business.  During the quarter, USB continued to augment its low-cost deposit franchise by  growing deposits by 6.4% (excluding the Charter One franchise acquisition)  relative to the year-ago quarter, and by 1.1% on a linked quarter basis.  This  was accomplished with the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities remaining  constant. Due to pricing competition for loans in the marketplace as well as the impact of  lower interest rates on the growing securities portfolio, USB's net interest  margin (NIM) declined to 3.08%, down from 3.14% in the sequential quarter and  3.35% in the year-ago quarter.  Fitch would expect continued margin compression  for USB, as well as the rest of the industry, until short-term rates eventually  rise. USB's total expenses declined relative to the sequential quarter, but increased  by 4.8% from the year ago quarter due in part to employee compensation and  benefits.  Nevertheless, in Fitch's view the company's efficiency ratio remains  strong at 53.4%. Fitch notes that credit quality for USB continues to improve.  Fitch believes  that credit quality for USB, and the rest of the industry, is at or near a  cyclical trough, and would expect some reversion in credit metrics over a  medium-term time horizon.  That said, it would also expect USB to continue to  have much better credit performance than industry averages. In Fitch's opinion USB's capital and liquidity position remain sound.  USB's  fully implemented Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  standardized approach was 9.2% at 1Q'15 and under the advanced approaches was  11.8% at 1Q'15.  Given the company's strong earnings performance, Fitch  considers these capital ratios appropriate, even considering that the company  returned 70% of 1Q,15 earnings to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. In addition, USB is in early compliance with both the Liquidity Coverage Rule  (LCR) and the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR).

186,USB,U.S. regulator limits mortgage servicing activities at six banks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. bank regulator on Wednesday said it imposed restrictions on mortgage servicing against HSBC, Wells Fargo and four others because they failed to meet all of the requirements of a major settlement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said the new limitations would apply to acquisitions of residential mortgage servicing rights, outsourcing servicing to others, and other related business activities. Mortgage servicers accept payments from borrowers, negotiate loan modifications and pursue foreclosures. They include lenders and outside companies that buy the rights to handle loans. Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, banks reached a settlement with regulators over their mishandling of servicing activities, including “robo-signing”, or using defective or fraudulent documents, to pursue home foreclosures.     Wells Fargo and HSBC face the toughest restrictions, the OCC said on Wednesday, and JPMorgan Chase, EverBank, Santander and U.S. Bank also will have certain activities limited. The rules do not prevent banks from making any new loans, the OCC said. Wells Fargo and HSBC each said in separate statements on Wednesday that they had made progress on servicing issues and were continuing to work on fixing the remaining problems. JPMorgan said in a statement that it expected to meet all the requirements by the end of the summer. The regulator said it also planned to take additional actions against the six banks. The OCC said Bank of America, Citigroup and PNC all had met the requirements under the agreement. So far, the settlement has resulted in payments of more than $2.7 billion to borrowers, the OCC said. The regulator said it expected about $280 million to be unclaimed at the end of 2015, and borrowers could access that money through state processes.

189,USB,U.S. Bancorp unit to pay $44.5 million in Peregrine settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A unit of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp has agreed to pay $44.5 million to settle a class action brought by former customers of brokerage Peregrine Financial Group, which failed in 2012 after its funds were siphoned off in a long-running fraud. Disclosed on Thursday in a filing in an Illinois federal court, the proposed settlement resolves claims that the bank let Peregrine’s founder Russell Wasendorf Sr. treat an account set up for brokerage customer funds like a personal checking account, diverting money for himself and his other businesses. “We are pleased to have reached a resolution regarding Peregrine Financial Group,” U.S. Bank spokesman Dana Ripley said in an emailed message. Ripley said the settlement will have no impact on the company’s second-quarter financial results.  U.S. Bank, the banking unit of U.S. Bancorp, was accused in the lawsuit of fraud by omission, breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The lawsuit said Wasendorf misappropriated funds from an account at U.S. Bank that was supposed to be used exclusively for the benefit of Peregrine customers.  Wasendorf is serving a 50-year sentence after pleading guilty to embezzling more than $215 million from thousands of Peregrine customers in a nearly 20-year fraud. The futures brokerage filed to liquidate in 2012 after regulators accused it of misappropriating customer money, dealing a blow to confidence in the U.S. futures industry just months after the larger MF Global collapsed. The proposed settlement, which requires court approval, would repay about 14,000 former customers more than 20 percent of the money Wasendorf diverted, before accounting for attorneys fees and expenses, according to Thursday’s court filing.   In the filing, lawyers for Peregrine’s former customers said they may seek up to 31 percent of the settlement fund in attorneys’ fees. In February, U.S. Bancorp agreed to pay $18 million to former Peregrine customers to settle a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2013 over the Wasendorf fraud.

Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The upgrade of USB's ratings is reflective of an institution that for several  years now has set itself apart from peer institutions due to a number of  competitive advantages and a strong operating culture. This has led to better  earnings and credit performance than nearly all peer banks over multiple  operating cycles, and Fitch believes USB is taking steps to extend its  advantages compared to peer institutions. Fitch believes USB's key competitive advantages relate to cost and its  differentiated business franchise. First, over time USB has enjoyed a cost of  funding advantage relative to peers primarily driven by its low-cost deposit  base, which has allowed USB to profitably lower loan prices to keep or win new  clients. While it is noteworthy that there has been some compression in the  funding cost advantage in recent years amid very low interest rates, Fitch  believes this advantage will become more evident should interest rates  eventually rise at some point.   Fitch believes the funding cost advantage is important because it helps to bring  new banking relationships into the bank, to which the company can then actively  cross-sell other services. To the extent that this cross-sell is successful, it  creates a virtuous cycle that fosters stickier customer relationships, which in  turn allows the company to keep deposit costs low. This can then be used to  attract even more customers to the bank.  Secondly, USB operates a very efficient bank where operating expense management  is ingrained in the company's corporate culture. It routinely has an efficiency  ratio in the low 50's, better than many Fitch rated financial institutions,  which largely helps to support the company's superior earnings performance. As  an example, if USB's efficiency ratio was closer to industry averages, its  return on assets (ROA) would also be closer to industry averages. USB complements these core competitive advantages with a balanced business  model, which Fitch views favorably from a credit perspective. This includes a  loan portfolio that is well balanced between commercial and consumer assets, as  well as an earnings stream that is nearly evenly balanced between net interest  income (NII) and non-interest income. It is in this latter category, that Fitch believes, USB is beginning to extend  its advantages relative to peer institutions. USB's corporate trust business is  an area of differentiation for the company. The returns on capital in this  business are relatively stable and it also provides a source of advantageous  deposit funding to the company. Merchant processing is another area of  differentiation for USB. This business is highly scalable and not overly capital  intensive with good growth prospects, particularly internationally. In addition, Fitch would also note that USB is able to run the company at lower  capital ratios than some larger competitors as USB is not subject to a G-SIB  buffer, among other capital requirements. Furthermore, USB's ability to accrete  capital via growth in retained earnings more quickly than some peers due to the  earnings power noted above provides a buffer to these comparatively lower ratios  from a creditor's perspective. In Fitch's view, this capital advantage allows USB to potentially be more  competitive than some peers for certain clients' business while at the same time  maintaining appropriate risk and return parameters that are also consistent with  the company's very balanced risk appetite.  Finally, underpinning all of these advantages is a management team that  continuously makes keen strategic and operating decisions which are responsible  for helping to create and sustain the company's corporate culture. Fitch views  USB's management team as one of, if not the best, in the industry.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES USB's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'aa' for loss  severity. USB's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. USB's trust and REIT  preferred stock entities, USB Capital IX and USB Realty Corp, are notched four  levels below its VR. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and  assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles  and have thus been upgraded.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of U.S. Bank National Association (USBNA) is rated  one notch higher than USB's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured  deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives  deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  USB's uninsured deposits outside of the U.S., through Elavon Financial Services  Limited (Elavon), do not benefit from rating uplift because they do not  typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference unless the deposit is  expressly payable at an office of the bank in the United States. Since Fitch  cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do  not get the rating uplift. HOLDING COMPANY  USB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The VR of USBNA is equalized with USB's VR reflecting Fitch's view that these  are core to USB's business strategy and financial profile. The IDRs and VRs of  USB's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized with USB's IDR  reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to USB's business strategy  and financial profile. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR USB has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, USB is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support. Elavon has a support rating of '1', which is an institutional support rating,  and indicates that there is a high probability that USB would provide support to  Elavon, which is domiciled in Ireland.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT With today's upgrade, USB's ratings are at the top of Fitch's Global Bank  Universe, and are solidly situated at their current level. Downward pressure on ratings, while not expected, could result from a number of  factors.  Given that management is a key component in Fitch's analysis and views  of the company, USB's ratings would be sensitive to any significant and  unplanned management changes that would result in a change in business strategy  or risk appetite.  While Fitch would expect some deterioration in credit metrics for USB--as well  as the rest of the industry--given today's benign credit environment, should  USB's credit results deteriorate at a rate faster than peer group averages,  there could be pressure to ratings or the Rating Outlook. Additionally, should USB's earnings performance begin to match peer levels  rather than consistently exceed them, this could impact ratings over time. While Fitch views USB's interest rate risk positioning as neutral, which Fitch  views positively from a credit perspective, should the company's performance be  negatively impacted by a rising rate environment, this could also impact ratings  negatively. Fitch views the cumulative effects of USB's regulatory initiatives and potential  litigation risk as manageable and contemplated within the rating upgrade. If any  of these efforts ultimately resulted in an outsized fine that pressures capital,  it is may create downward rating pressure. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for USB and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to USB's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to USB's  long-and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should USB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of USB to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in USB's IDRs.  To the extent that one of USB's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from USB's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since USB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Additionally, there is limited likelihood that Elavon's institutional support  rating of '1' will change over the foreseeable future.

200,USB,Fitch: Good Performance in USB's 3Q15 Results,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 15 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) third quarter 2015 (3Q15)  continued to be strong and support Fitch Ratings' upgrade of the company's  Viability Rating (VR) to 'aa' earlier this month. USB's 3Q15 return on average assets (ROAA) came in at 1.44% and its return on  average equity (ROAE) was a strong 14.1%. Given the impact low interest rates are having on earnings across the banking  industry as well as the continued increase in compliance and regulatory costs,  Fitch considers USB's continued strong earnings performance to be noteworthy.  This quarter included a couple of non-recurring items, which were cumulatively  neutral on the company's results.  USB reclassified its student loan portfolio  to held for investment from held for sale, and this caused a $58 million charge  giving the disruption in the student loan market this quarter.  Additionally,  USB recorded $60 million of costs related to mortgage banking compliance.  This  was offset by $135 million of gains related to the sale of stock in Visa during  the quarter. Net interest income (NII) was up relative to both the sequential and year-ago  quarters thanks to a stable net interest margin of 3.04% relative to the  sequential period, and a larger balance sheet relative to the year-ago quarter. Similarly, non-interest income expanded relative to the sequential and  prior-year's quarter thanks in part to higher trust and investment management  fees as well as higher merchant processing revenue.  This was partially offset  by lower mortgage banking revenue. USB's expenses grew due to higher compensation and benefits expense as well as  the non-recurring items noted above.  The company's efficiency ratio on a tax  equivalent basis inched up to 53.9%, which still compares very favorably to  peers. Given that interest rates continue to remain low, which constrains revenue  growth, Fitch expects USB's management to be even more vigilant on expense  management in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016. Areas of focus include continued management of the company's employee base and  other discretionary expense items such as travel, printing and postage, and  optimizing professional service contracts. Asset quality for USB--as well as the rest of the industry--remains good.  Both  non-performing loans and net charge-offs remain low and near what Fitch believes  to be a cyclical trough.  Fitch would expect some reversion in asset quality  metrics over time, but would still expect USB's credit performance to be better  than peers. USB indicated that is beginning to observe some aggressive lending in certain  areas of Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and that it would be slightly pulling back  on growing loans in this space. Fitch continues to consider USB's capital and liquidity position as appropriate  for the company's risk profile. USB continues to grow deposits more quickly than loans and the company's loan to  deposit ratio was 85% at the end of 3Q15. USB's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  standardized approach (USB's binding constraint ratio) was flat relative to the  sequential quarter at 9.2%.  Fitch would note that USB also returned  approximately 80% of current quarter earnings to shareholders via both buybacks  and dividends.

205,USB,Fitch: USB's Good Performance in 4Q15 Supportive of its High Ratings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) fourth quarter 2015 (4Q15) and  full year 2015 earnings continued to be strong and support the company's  ratings, which are the highest in Fitch Ratings' global bank rating universe.   USB's 4Q15 return on average assets (ROAA) 1.41%, down modestly from the 1.44%  in 3Q15.  The company's 2015 full year ROAA was 1.44% relative to 1.54% in the  prior year period. Given the impact low interest rates are still having on earnings across the  banking industry as well as the continued increase in compliance and regulatory  costs, Fitch considers USB's earnings performance to be strong.  USB's total revenue expanded 1.2% from the sequential quarter and 2%  year-over-year.  This growth was largely driven by better net interest income  (NII) primarily driven by higher loan balances as well as the build of the  securities portfolio over the course of the year for Liquidity Coverage Ratio  (LCR) purposes. Average total loans, excluding covered loans, grew 2.5% from the linked quarter  and 4.8% year-over-year.  The linked quarter growth was driven by growth in auto  loans, credit card receivables, and continued growth in commercial loans.  The  year-over-year growth was more substantially impacted by higher commercial loan  balances, with smaller contributions from auto loans, card receivables, and  construction and development loans. While the yields in USB's auto portfolio and card portfolio are comparatively  good, loan yields in the commercial portfolio, which is USB's largest portfolio,  continue to be very competitive.  This mix, as well as the build of the  securities portfolio noted above, resulted in the company's net interest margin  (NIM) remaining relatively unchanged compared to the linked quarter, and down 18  basis points year-over-year. Overall non-interest income, which represents approximately 45% of the company's  revenue, was up 0.60% relative to the linked quarter and down 0.80%  year-over-year.  While there are a number of puts and takes, the overall trends  are higher credit and debit card revenue and higher trust and investment  management fees offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. USB's expense management continues to be good, with the company's efficiency  ratio coming in at 53% both for 4Q15 and full-year 2015.  While the revenue  environment is improving, it still remains challenging and Fitch expects USB to  continue to aggressively manage expense over the course of 2016. USB's asset quality metrics continue to be good and are seasonally higher than  the linked quarter but lower than the year-ago period.   Fitch notes that USB does have some criticized energy related credits, though  energy loans only comprise 1.2% of USB's total portfolio, which Fitch thinks  will be largely manageable.  USB has a 5.4% reserve against this exposure, due  to some added provision this last quarter.   Overall provision expense was higher this quarter as some loan growth and the  energy activity noted above served to boost provision expense by 8.2% relative  to the linked quarter, though it was down 7.9% year-over-year as overall credit  quality remains strong. Fitch continues to consider USB's capital and liquidity position as appropriate  for the company's risk profile. USB continues to grow deposits more and the company's loan to deposit ratio was  85.5% at the end of 4Q15. USB's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  standardized approach (USB's binding constraint ratio) was slightly down  relative to the sequential quarter at 9.1%.  Fitch would note that USB also  returned approximately 72% of current quarter earnings to shareholders via both  buybacks and dividends. Fitch would also note that USB disclosed a consent order with its regulator the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) this quarter due to some  required changes in the company's BSA/AML program.  Fitch believes that the  company is working to be in compliance with the requirements laid out in the  order and it won't impact the company's ratings at this time.

210,USB,Fitch: Good Earnings for U.S. Bancorp Despite Higher Energy Provisioning,,4202016,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFit956208
211,USB,U.S. Bancorp profit slips on energy loan provisions,"(Reuters) - Regional lender U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) reported a 3 percent fall in quarterly profit, weighed down by higher costs and increased reserves for bad loans to the energy industry. Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp fell to $1.39 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.43 billion a year earlier. On a per share basis, earnings were unchanged at 76 cents. U.S. Bancorp set aside $330 million in the quarter to cover bad loans mostly related to struggling energy companies, compared with $264 million a year earlier. The bank said credit quality was relatively stable other than energy-related commercial loans, the deterioration of which impacted the amount of nonperforming assets and the provision for credit losses. The results come a day after another regional lender Comerica Inc (CMA.N) reported a 55 percent fall in quarterly profit as it boosted its provisions for soured loans by more than ten times to $148 million. The U.S. banking industry has had a rough start to the year, with near-zero interest rates, a slowdown in China and stubbornly low oil prices hampering revenue growth.  Many lenders have ramped up reserves, concerned by the increasing number of energy companies that have gone bankrupt and defaulted on loans in recent months.  U.S. Bancorp’s net revenue increased 2.7 percent to $5 billion during the quarter. Total non-interest expenses rose 3.2 percent to $2.75 billion, largely due to higher compensation expenses.

212,USB,UPDATE 1-U.S. Bancorp profit slips on energy loan provisions,"(Reuters) - Regional lender U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) reported a 3 percent fall in quarterly profit, weighed down by higher costs and increased reserves for bad loans to the energy industry. Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp fell to $1.39 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.43 billion a year earlier. On a per share basis, earnings were unchanged at 76 cents. U.S. Bancorp set aside $330 million in the quarter to cover bad loans mostly related to struggling energy companies, compared with $264 million a year earlier. The bank said credit quality was relatively stable other than energy-related commercial loans, the deterioration of which impacted the amount of nonperforming assets and the provision for credit losses. The results come a day after another regional lender Comerica Inc (CMA.N) reported a 55 percent fall in quarterly profit as it boosted its provisions for soured loans by more than ten times to $148 million. The U.S. banking industry has had a rough start to the year, with near-zero interest rates, a slowdown in China and stubbornly low oil prices hampering revenue growth.  Many lenders have ramped up reserves, concerned by the increasing number of energy companies that have gone bankrupt and defaulted on loans in recent months.  U.S. Bancorp’s net revenue increased 2.7 percent to $5 billion during the quarter. Total non-interest expenses rose 3.2 percent to $2.75 billion, largely due to higher compensation expenses. Up to Tuesday’s close, U.S. Bancorp’s shares have lost 1.8 percent in value this year, outperforming the KBW Banking Index .BKX, which has fallen 6.4 percent.

217,USB,Fitch: Basel Proposals Could Impact US Bank Credit Card Lines,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK/CHICAGO, May 12 (Fitch) The Basel Committee's (BCBS) proposal to apply  higher capital charges for ""unconditionally cancellable lines of credit"" (UCCs)  could impact internationally active US credit card banks CET1 ratios on average  by 375 basis points, absent any remedial measures from affected institutions,  says Fitch Ratings. If implemented by the US authorities, the measures will  encourage US banks to reduce unused lines of credit to avoid lowering their  capital ratios. This follows the publication of written feedback on the December  2015 consultative proposals to revise the Standardized Approach for credit risk.  Capital rules require banks to convert undrawn credit lines to credit exposures  by multiplying the committed but undrawn amount by a credit conversion factor  (CCF). UCCs to both retail and corporate clients are currently subject to a 0%  CCF under the standardized approach to credit risk (SA). US bank holding  companies with total assets in excess of $250bn, with regulatory approval to use  models for calculating their capital requirements, remain subject to a capital  floor based on 100% of their SA capital requirements. At year-end 2015, UCC  totaling about USD3trn were subject to an SA 0% CCF for a select range of the  largest US bank holding companies and credit card banks, based on regulatory  disclosures. The BCBS believes that consumer protection laws and reputational risk  considerations may constrain banks' ability to cancel such commitments. For this  reason, the Committee believes a 0% CCF is inappropriate and proposes a new CCF  of between 50% and75% for wholesale UCCs and 10% and 20% CCFs for retail UCCs,  i.e. credit cards and personal overdraft facilities. The Basel Committee  proposals would impact large internationally active banks operating under the  Advanced approach.  For large internationally active credit card banks, the implications could be  material if adopted and could change the competitive position for affected  firms. Fitch estimates end-2015 CET1 ratios for select credit card banks could  fall by an average of 3.75% if a 20% UCC CCF is applied to retail credit card  exposures and a 75% CCF applied to wholesale credit card exposures. In contrast,  estimated average CET1 ratios for the large universal banks would drop by just  0.78%. As such, if the US regulatory authorities adopt the BCBS UCC proposal in  its current form, Fitch expects credit card issuers will seek to reduce the  amount of UCC by trimming credit lines for active accounts and/or closing  inactive accounts.  In contrast to US institutions, banks in other major jurisdictions are not  currently subject to a 100% capital floor, where the internal ratings-based  model approach is often used to calculate capital charges for credit card  exposures. Based on a Fitch review of 105 medium-to-large EU banks at end-1H15,  only a few individual German, Dutch, Finnish, and UK banks appear to benefit  significantly from the application of the SA 0% CCF for UCCs. The revised SA proposals for UCCs are possibly influenced by parallel studies  undertaken by the Committee on how banks use internal models to estimate credit  risk capital requirements for UCCs. In a study released on April 1, 2016, the  Committee found that some banks do not assign CCFs (zero or otherwise) to UCCs,  while some banks assign a 0% CCF to commitments that are only conditionally  cancellable. The study also found that assigned non-zero CCFs usually do not  differ materially between UCCs and other facilities.

221,USB,Fitch: Solid 2Q16 Earnings for U.S. Bancorp,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 15 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) second quarter 2016 (2Q16)  earnings continued to be strong and near the top of the banking industry,  according to Fitch Ratings. This level of operating performance continues to  support USB's ratings of 'AA/F1+', which are the highest in Fitch's Global Bank  Ratings Universe.  USB's annualized return on average assets (ROAA) remained strong at 1.43% in  2Q16, up from 1.32% in the sequential quarter, but incrementally down from 1.46%  in the year ago quarter. Similarly, the company's annualized return on average  equity (ROE) was 13.8% in 2Q16 up from 13% from the sequential quarter but down  from 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.  USB's results continue to consistently be above Fitch's estimate of a range of  the company's long-term cost of equity assumption of between 10%-12%. There were a couple of notable items in the quarter including $180 million of  equity investment income due to the company's membership in Visa Europe Limited,  which was sold to Visa, Inc. in mid-June 2016. This gain was offset by $110  million of accruals related to regulatory and legal matters as well as a $40mn  charitable contribution. USB's total net revenue was up 8.2% from the sequential quarter and 8.1% from  the year ago quarter.  Net interest income (NII) was up relative to both the sequential and year-ago  quarter as some improvement in loan yields and loan mix were offset by lower  rates on new securities purchases as well as lower reinvestment rates on  maturing securities. As a result, the company's net interest margin declined  modestly to 3.02% as of 2Q16. The bigger driver of the revenue increase was higher non-interest income, which  increased 18.8% relative to the sequential quarter and 12.3% relative to the  year-ago quarter. This was driven by the Visa gain noted above as well as higher  credit and debit card revenue, higher commercial products revenue, and higher  mortgage banking income incrementally offset by lower investment products  revenue. USB's mortgage banking revenue was seasonally higher by 27.3% relative to the  sequential quarter, with 65% of mortgage volume driven by new home purchases and  35% driven by refinancings. Given the rally in mortgage rates in the latter part  of the quarter, USB expects an additional 30% growth in mortgage banking revenue  over the next quarter. The company's overall provision expense declined incrementally relative to the  sequential quarter after a significant build last quarter related to higher  levels of criticized energy loans.  This quarter's improvement was driven by modestly lower energy exposure as both  energy loans and commitments declined relative to the sequential quarter as many  loans moved through the spring redetermination period and USB lowered is average  oil price deck to $35 per barrel. Additionally, the improvement in overall oil  prices during the quarter likely helped to shelter performance of underlying  borrowers. Fitch continues to believe that potential problems within USB's energy portfolio  will be manageable given the company's reserves to energy loans of 8.8% at 2Q16,  which compare well with peers. Additionally, the bulk of the company's  criticized energy loans are still performing. USB's non-interest expenses increased relative to both the sequential and  year-ago quarters. This was due to higher compensation expense reflecting merit  increases during the quarter as well as higher professional services expenses  due to compliance related matters. USB continues to address its consent order  related to its anti-money laundering program. Nevertheless the company's efficiency ratio remained strong at 54.9% in 2Q16,  inclusive of the notable items mentioned above.  Credit quality remains good and the company's ratio of non-performing assets to  loans plus other real estate owned (OREO) (excluding covered assets) improved  incrementally to 0.62 due to some modest improvement in the energy portfolio  noted above.  USB has continued to exhibit good loan growth, with average loans (excluding  covered loans) up 1.7% relative to the sequential quarter and 8.6% relative to  the year-ago quarter. The growth was generally broad based but highlighted by  higher commercial loan balances as well as higher construction and development  loans. In 2Q16, USB's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was relatively  unchanged both under the standardized and advanced approaches. The fully  phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio under the standardized approach was 9.3% (USB's  binding constraint) and under the advanced approach was 12%. USB recently received a non-objection to its capital plan under the  Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress tests. As a result USB  announced a $2.6bn share repurchase program and a 9.8% increase in its common  dividend. In 2Q16 USB returned 77% of earnings to owners via dividends and buybacks, and  Fitch believes the company's total payout ratio will remain between 60%-80% over  the balance of the year.

222,USB,Lagging US bank sector could appeal to bond investors,"NEW YORK (IFR) - Spreads on US bank bonds have lagged the rally in corporate credit, and that could offer investors a chance for decent pick-up as banks hit the market post-earnings in the days ahead. JP Morgan (A3/A-) was first out of the gate Thursday, selling a US$3bn 10-year trade at Treasuries plus 145bp - spot on the low end of IPTs with no pricing progression at all. The deal offered a 10bp concession to the bank’s curve, more than on recent deals from industrials. It was trading 3bp inside reoffer on Friday.  Analysts said strong demand from domestic and foreign investors should push the sector tighter as more banks come to market next week.     “There is very little juice in industrial bonds at this point,” said Hans Mikkelsen, credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “But there is a lot of value in bank bonds.” Since hitting a multi-year wide of 234bp on February 11, corporate bond spreads in industrials have tightened 88bp to 146bp, according to data from Barclays. But bank spreads have tightened only 39bp over the same period, coming in to 136bp from 175bp. That underperformance reverses the trend of the previous three years. Bank spreads began trading tighter than industrials after the summer of 2013, when both were trading at 135bp. By February 2016, banks were trading 69bp inside industrials. Over that time, US banks have become an investor staple as regulators have forced them to increase capital buffers and exit risky business lines. That is in contrast to many European lenders, which are still grappling with crisis-era litigation, restructuring and bad loans. “If you’re a US investor wanting to deploy capital, you would be more circumspect toward European banks,” said Neil Sutherland, a portfolio manager at Schroders. “That may accelerate the dichotomy between US and European banks.” BAML’s Mikkelsen said the risks for US banks are limited compared to those in Europe. “In some European banks you have real credit risk,” he said. “In the US creditors are pretty confident.” As other US banks come out of earnings blackouts - Wells Fargo and Citigroup reported earnings on Friday - new deals could be tempting for the buyside.          Banks need to raise extra funding to meet new Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements proposed last year.  Expectation of that supply is one factor that has kept bank spreads more elevated, but amid a bull run in corporate bonds, that is unlikely to last, said investors. “Folks may look at the supply that is coming as an opportunity to take advantage of the underperformance,” said Jason Shoup, fixed income strategist at Legal & General Investment Management America. “If you believe the market is going to continue to tighten, you have to look at the lagging sectors,” he told IFR. “Banking is one of those sectors.” But some investors still worry that wobbles in Europe, particularly the Italy banking crisis, could set off problems in the US bank sector.  “If there is a bail-in, and that leads to contagion in Europe, that could spill over into the global US banks,” said Jacob Habibi, senior analyst at Invesco.

225,USB,Fitch: Yield Curve Flattening Remains a Risk to US Bank Margins,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK/CHICAGO, September 23 (Fitch) A flattening yield curve could continue  to pressure US bank margins following the latest Federal Reserve open market  committee (FOMC) meeting where the medium-term projection for the Fed funds  target rate was lowered again, says Fitch Ratings.  The uncertainty over the rate trajectory and terminal rate, coupled with the  unprecedented length of this low rate period, remain key challenges and sources  of uncertainty for the US banking sector. That said, Fitch believes that rate  risks alone are unlikely to pose major risks to bank credit profiles or ratings. The Fed highlighted that economic conditions had strengthened the case for a  rate increase at the FOMC meeting held on 21 September, underscoring Fitch's  view that an additional 25bps hike by the end of this year is likely. However  the broader messaging remained consistent with a very slow and gradual process  of interest rate normalization, while the Fed's weighted average median  projection for the target rate through to 2019 fell by 25-50bps. This follows a  steady and continuous decline in the target rate projections over the past year.  <iframe src=""//e.infogr.am/666e716c-31bb-4f00-883e-ccc03f12ef4a?src=embe d""  title=""Fed Funds Dot Plot"" width=""550"" height=""741"" scrolling=""no""  frameborder=""0"">  The economic uncertainty and declining long-term rate expectations have  contributed to a steadily flattening yield curve since early 2014, which has  continued this year. Without a sustained reversal in this trend, bank net  interest margins (NIM) are unlikely to see a material increase as margin  pressures are likely to remain. Even a rise in short-term rates would have  limited effect on bank earnings without a corresponding increase in medium and  long-term rates. Fitch maintains that a sustained and consistently steep yield  curve will be the key factor for improving NIMs over a meaningful period with  the shape of the curve being more important for bank earnings than the level of  short-term rates.  Continued low rates could contribute to higher mortgage refinancing and improved  non-interest income, but on aggregate, this has not been sufficient to offset  the earnings effects from falling NIMs. Banks will continue to focus on expenses and operational efficiencies to address  margin compression. Longer duration balance sheets will also be a consequence as  expectations for the low rate environment extend further into the future. Fitch  expects growth in the proportion of long-term loans and securities - maturities  greater than 5 years - in recent years to continue.  On aggregate, the longer duration balance sheet could pose a risk to banks in  the event of a sudden and unexpected increase in rates, but for now are unlikely  to pose a substantive risk to bank ratings. However, should individual banks  react to longer-than-expected margin compression with significant changes to  their balance sheet or business strategies, this may sufficiently alter credit  profiles to warrant a rating action.

Additionally, USB continues to consistently perform better  than peers in the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress tests as measured by the  company's capital ratio deterioration under severely adverse scenario of the  test.  Fitch believes USB's key advantages relate to its business model and its low  cost operating model, both of which have contributed to USB's 'AA' ratings. USB has a balanced business model with net interest revenue (NIR) and  non-interest revenue nearly evenly split in their contribution to the company's  overall revenue base. Fitch views this balance favorably as it helps to support  the company's strong earnings performance through the cycle as well as its solid  internal capital generation. USB's merchant processing business is a significant proportion of the company's  non-interest revenue. Fitch views this growing source of revenue as somewhat  stable and very scalable, thereby providing some persistency to both USB's  earnings and internal capital generation. Combined with the company's strong  credit performance, this helps USB to operate at lower capital ratios than its  peers.  While USB's capital ratios are lower than peers, the company continues to  perform consistently better than nearly all peer institutions under the Federal  Reserve's annual CCAR stress tests. Fitch measures the annual deterioration of  each bank's capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario and notes that  USB continues to consistently be one of the strongest performing banks on this  metric.  USB's other key differentiator relative to peers is that management operates a  very efficient bank where operating expense management is ingrained in the  company's corporate culture. The company routinely has an efficiency ratio in  the low 50's, better than many Fitch rated financial institutions, which largely  helps to support the company's superior earnings performance. As an example, if  USB's efficiency ratio was closer to industry averages, its return on assets  (ROA) would also be closer to industry averages.  USB's funding profile is strong and positively differentiated from peers by its  large corporate trust business. This represents nearly 15% of USB's deposit  funding and is treated favorably by the Liquidity Coverage Rule (LCR). Finally, underpinning all of these advantages is a management team that  continuously makes keen strategic and operating decisions which are responsible  for helping to create and sustain the company's corporate culture. Fitch  continues to view USB's management team as one of, if not the, best in the  industry.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  USB has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, USB is not systemically important, and therefore the probability of  support is unlikely. Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and Viability Ratings (VRs)  do not incorporate any support. Elavon Financial Services Limited (Elavon) has a support rating of '1', which is  an institutional support rating, and indicates that there is a high probability  that USB would provide support to Elavon, which is domiciled in Ireland.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES USB's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'aa' for loss  severity. USB's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. USB's trust and REIT  preferred stock entities, USB Capital IX and USB Realty Corp, are notched four  levels below its VR. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and  assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of U.S. Bank National Association (USBNA) is rated  one notch higher than USB's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured  deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives  deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  USB's uninsured deposits outside of the U.S., through Elavon, do not benefit  from rating uplift because they do not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor  preference unless the deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in  the United States. Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits  may be dually payable, they do not get the rating uplift. HOLDING COMPANY  USB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The VR of USBNA is equalized with USB's VR reflecting Fitch's view that these  are core to USB's business strategy and financial profile. The IDRs and VRs of  USB's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized with USB's IDR  reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to USB's business strategy  and financial profile. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT USB's ratings are among the highest of Fitch's global banks, and are solidly  situated at their current level.  Downward pressure on ratings, while not expected, could result from a number of  factors. Given that management is a key component in Fitch's analysis and views  of the company, USB's ratings would be sensitive to any significant and  unplanned management changes that would result in a change in business strategy  or risk appetite.  While Fitch would expect some deterioration in credit metrics for USB (as well  as the rest of the industry) given today's benign credit environment, should  USB's credit results deteriorate at a rate faster than peer group averages this  could negatively impact ratings or the Rating Outlook. USB's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.3% as of June 30, 2016 is on the  lower end relative to peers, but the company continues to perform very well  under CCAR stress tests and generates a substantial amount of internal capital  via earnings, both of which support ratings. However, given the comparatively  low position of the ratio, should capital ratios meaningfully decline, this  could pressure the ratings or Outlook. Should technological evolution occur that disrupts the amount and persistency of  revenue in USB's merchant processing business this could negatively impact  ratings. At the same time, should Fitch observe that USB not incur sufficient  expenditures to maintain its technological infrastructure and develop new  technological enhancements, this could pressure ratings or the Outlook. Fitch views the cumulative effects of USB's regulatory initiatives and potential  litigation risk as manageable and contemplated within ratings. If any of these  efforts ultimately resulted in an outsized fine that pressures capital or  significant long-term reputational damage, it may create downward rating  pressure. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Since USB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Additionally, there is limited likelihood that Elavon's institutional support  rating of '1' will change over the foreseeable future. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for USB and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to USB's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to USB's  long-and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should USB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of USB to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in USB's IDRs.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: U.S. Bancorp --IDR at 'AA'; Outlook Stable; --Viability Rating (VR) at 'aa'; --Senior debt at 'AA'; --Subordinated Debt at 'AA-'; --Preferred Stock at 'BBB+; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1+'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.

228,USB,Fitch: Solid 3Q16 Earnings for U.S. Bancorp,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 19 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) third quarter 2016 (3Q16)  earnings were good and remain near the top of its large regional peer group and  the industry according to Fitch Ratings.  This level of operating performance  continues to support USB's high ratings. USB's annualized return on average assets (ROA) was a still good 1.36% in 3Q16,  down from 1.43% in the sequential quarter, and down from 1.44% in the year-ago  quarter. Additionally, the company's return on average equity (ROE) remained  above Fitch's estimated range of the company's cost of equity of between  10%-12%, which Fitch views favorably.  The ROE was 13.5% in 3Q16, down from  13.8% in the sequential quarter, and down from 14.0% in the year-ago quarter. USB's total net revenue was down 2% from the sequential quarter, but up 4.7%  from the year ago quarter. There was continued modest growth in net interest  income (NII) in both periods amid continued balance sheet growth, and more mixed  performance in non-interest income. USB's balance sheet has continued to grow over the course of the year.  Total  average loans (including covered loans) were up 1.1% relative to the sequential  quarter and 7.6% relative to the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year growth was  primarily driven by higher commercial, construction and development, as well as  credit card loans. The latter benefited from two portfolio acquisitions. Deposit growth for USB remained stronger than loan growth, with total deposits  increasing 3.6% from the sequential quarter and 10.0% from the year-ago quarter.   As a result the company's loan to deposit ratio ticked down to 79.9% in 3Q16.   The additional funding generated continues to be placed into cash and investment  securities, with cash balances having a more meaningful increase during the  quarter.  NII on a taxable equivalent basis grew 1.6% from the sequential quarter and 4.3%  from the year-ago quarter. This was due to the previously noted balance sheet  growth partially offset by a shrinking net interest margin (NIM) as the company  altered the mix of its investment portfolio over the last year with a larger  proportion of lower yielding treasury securities and a larger allocation to cash  this quarter. USB's NIM was 2.98% in 3Q16, down from 3.02% in the sequential quarter, and  3.06% in the year-ago quarter. Fitch would continue to expect the NIM to  modestly grind down unless the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates  again towards the end of the year. As noted, the company's non-interest income was down 4.2% from the sequential  quarter, but up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.  The sequential decline was due primarily to an unfavorably sequential comparison  as the linked quarter include a $180 million gain related to an equity  investment in Visa Europe as well as lower revenue from commercial products  partially offset by improved mortgage banking income amid the rally in mortgage  rates towards the beginning of the quarter. Relative to the year-ago quarter USB's non-interest income benefit from the  previously noted higher mortgage banking income as refinancing activity surged  during the quarter. Fitch notes that USB continues to manage expenses carefully, with total expenses  in 3Q16 down 2% relative to the sequential quarter, but up 5.6% relative to the  year-ago quarter. There is some noise in this numbers primarily due to  litigation accruals that occurred in the sequential quarter. In 2Q16, USB incurred $110 million of litigation accruals related to regulatory  and legal matters as well as a $40 million charitable contribution.  Excluding  these items from the sequential comparison, USB's 3Q16 non-interest expenses  relative to the sequential quarter would have increased 3.1%. This increase was  due to higher compensation expenses as well as the impact of the FDIC's deposit  insurance surcharge. Relative to the year-ago quarter USB's expenses were up due to higher  compensation costs as well as higher technology costs.  Fitch views technology  as an important differentiator for USB, and as such, would view a higher tech  spend generally favorably. While the company did not achieve positive operating leverage relative to either  the sequential or year-ago quarters, its efficiency ratio remained good at 54.5%  in 3Q16. Credit quality for USB was stable in 3Q16, as both net charge-off ratio (NCOs)  and non-performing asset ratio (NPAs) remained relatively stable over the course  of the last four quarters.  Fitch continues to believe that credit quality for  USB--as well as the rest of the industry--remains at or near a cyclical trough,  and Fitch would expect some reversion in credit metrics over a medium-term time  horizon. In 3Q16, USB's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was unchanged  relative to the sequential quarter both under the standardized and advanced  approaches. The fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio under the standardized  approach was 9.3% (USB's binding constraint) and under the advanced approach was  12.1%. This was due to 79% of earnings being returned to shareholders via dividends and  share buybacks, as well as the balance sheet growth noted above.

229,USB,MOVES-BAML reshuffles debt capital markets,"LONDON, Oct 19 (IFR) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch has reshuffled its debt capital markets team, appointing Andrew Karp and Brendan Hanley as co-heads of global DCM, according to an internal memo seen by IFR. Karp previously co-ran the US bank’s Americas investment-grade capital market business with Hanley. They report to AJ Murphy, head of global capital markets. BAML has realigned its combined DCM and corporate banking teams in Europe, Middle East and Africa. As a result, Marc Tempelman, who co-headed EMEA corporate banking and debt capital markets, has been appointed vice chairman of capital markets, reporting to Murphy and Bob Elfring, head of EMEA corporate and investment banking. He will focus on expanding strategic relationships with the bank’s key clients. His former co-head, Fernando Vicario, will become sole head of EMEA corporate banking, reporting to Anne Clarke Wolff, head of global corporate banking and Elfring. Jeff Tannenbaum is now head of DCM and syndicate for EMEA, a step-up from running DCM origination and syndicate. He now reports to Karp and Hanley on a product basis, and regionally to Elfring. BAML also told staff on Wednesday it had appointed Diego de Giorgi as sole head of global investment banking as his previous co-head Karim Assef takes on a new role. Assef and De Giorgi became co-heads of the newly created global investment banking division at the Wall Street firm in April 2015, with Assef based in New York and De Giorgi in London. De Giorgi, who joined BAML from Goldman Sachs in 2013 as co-head of the lender’s Europe, Middle East and Africa corporate and investment banking, will remain in London, according to a memo sent to staff. Assef, who has been at the bank for around 20 years, will become chairman of global investment banking, a newly created position to focus on client relationships based in New York.

Net income attributable to the bank rose to $1.50 billion, or 84 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.49 billion, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a profit of 83 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total net revenue rose to $5.39 billion from $5.15 billion. During the quarter, the bank had set aside $325 million to cover bad loans, up 15.2 percent from a year earlier. New York-based M&T; Bank Corp (MTB.N) also reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Wednesday.

234,USB,"Fitch: 4Q US Bank Earnings to be Mixed, Volatility Lifts Trading","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 10 (Fitch) Fitch expects large U.S. banks' 4Q16 results will  be mixed. Large trading banks' earnings likely benefited from election-related  market volatility; however, overall loan growth likely remained muted during the  quarter. The Federal Reserve's decision to increase short-term rates 25bps came  late in the quarter, such that net interest margins did not likely benefit.  Fitch expects credit trends remained fairly benign during the quarter,  particularly as oil prices stabilized.  While overall loan growth is expected to be sluggish for the quarter, consumer  lending likely came in relatively stronger, mainly driven by credit card and  automobile loan growth. According to Federal Reserve figures for large domestic  banks, overall loan growth is estimated at 0.5%-0.7% for 4Q16, dampened by  election and monetary policy uncertainties.   Fitch anticipates that residential mortgage volumes slowed during the quarter,  mainly due to lower refinance activity, putting downward pressure on mortgage  banking revenues. The interest rate increase could be beneficial to the  valuation of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), as prepayments typically slow  when rates increase, although much depends on bank-specific assumptions used and  any hedging related activity.  While banks did not likely see a lift in their net interest margins, large banks  incurred unrealized valuation losses on available for sale (AFS) securities due  to the rate rise. According to Federal Reserve data, large domestic banks swung  from a cumulative gain position of $19.9 billion at the end of 3Q16 to an  estimated loss position of $11.2 billion during the quarter. Although not a core  earnings issue, for advanced approach banks, valuation losses are recognized in  regulatory capital ratios. Furthermore, given Federal Reserve monetary policy  guidance, Fitch anticipates AFS securities portfolio valuations will remain  pressured.   Trading activity likely benefited from the outcome of the U.S. presidential  election and Federal Reserve policy as market participants re-positioned  portfolios across FICC and equities versus the year-ago period. This is  particularly the case given that the fourth quarter is typically a slower period  for sales and trading. This should buoy the results for the large U.S. trading  banks, which continue to gain market share against their European peers.     Banks continued to grow deposits during the quarter, outpacing loan growth. We  expect continued growth in non-interest bearing balances until banks begin to  meaningfully increase rates offered on various deposit products.

237,USB,Fitch: U.S. Bancorp's Earnings Flat; Signals Management Change,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 18 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) fourth quarter 2016 (4Q16) net  income declined 1.6% from the sequential quarter and was flat relative to the  year-ago quarter, according to Fitch Ratings. For the full year USB's net income  was flat relative to the prior year. USB's 4Q16 annualized return on average assets (ROAA) was 1.32%, down from 1.36%  in prior quarter and 1.41% in the year-ago quarter. ROAA for the full year 2016  was 1.36%, also down from 1.44% in 2015.  USB also indicated that its long-term Chairman and CEO Richard Davis will become  Executive Chairman, and he will be replaced by current President and COO Andrew  Cecere, who had also previously been Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the  corporation.  USB's 4Q16 total net revenue was essentially flat from the sequential quarter,  and up 4.3% from the year-ago quarter. However, USB delivered negative operating  leverage relative to both the sequential quarter and year-ago quarters as  expenses climbed 2.5% relative to 3Q16 and 6.9% relative to 4Q15. Higher  expenses were primarily due to growth in compliance costs related to its consent  order around Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering as well as Department of  Labor fiduciary rule. As a result of the negative operating leverage USB's efficiency ratio ticked up  to 55.3%, which remains near the top of peer group averages. Fitch would expect  some levelling off of expenses should the compliance related costs begin to  abate over the course of the year. USB's NII grew 2.1% relative to the sequential quarter and 4.6% relative to the  year ago quarter primarily due to growth in average earning assets as USB's  fully taxable equivalent net interest margin (NIM) has remained relatively  stable at 2.98% in 4Q16. The NIM remained stable as higher cash balances and  lower reinvestment rates on securities offset the impact of higher interest  rates and some loan growth. Average loans grew 1.1% relative to the sequential quarter driven by higher  commercial loan balances and higher credit card balances. Relative to the  year-ago quarter average loans grew 6.2% driven by higher credit card balances,  commercial loans, and residential mortgages. However, the company did indicate  that overall loan utilization remain low. Deposit growth continues to outpace loan growth despite higher interest rates  across the industry. Average total deposits grew 3.3% from the sequential  quarter and 11.8% from the year-ago quarter. As deposit growth has continued to  outpace loan growth, and been held in cash and high quality liquid assets (HQLA)  this has also dampened the effect of higher interest rates on USB's NIM. Performance in the company's various non-interest income businesses was more  mixed. Overall non-interest income declined 0.6% from the sequential quarter as  higher credit and debit card revenue was offset by the expected decline in  mortgage banking income and the seasonal decline in payments products revenue  reflecting lower government related transaction volumes. Relative to the  year-ago quarter, overall non-interest income expanded 3.9% due to higher credit  and debit card revenue as well as higher mortgage banking income. USB's overall credit quality metrics continues to remain well below historical  levels for both USB and the industry, and at what Fitch believes to be near  industrywide troughs. Total net charge-offs (NCOs) ticked up 1 basis point  relative to the sequential quarter and was unchanged relative to the year-ago  quarter at 0.47% in 4Q16. Similarly, non-performing asset (NPA) ratios remained  strong at 0.59% in 4Q16, relative to 0.61% in the sequential quarter and 0.58%  in the year-ago quarter. In 4Q16, USB's fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio under the standardized  approach ticked down 20 basis points to 9.1%. This was due to the aforementioned  balance sheet growth as well as returning 79% of earnings being returned to  shareholders via dividends and share buybacks.

241,USB,Fitch: Corporate Tax Changes May Aid US Bank Earnings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK/CHICAGO, March 06 (Fitch) Potential federal corporate tax cuts may aid  US bank earnings over the long run, according to Fitch Ratings. However, they  could also result in deferred tax asset (DTA) and liability (DTL) revaluations,  causing one-time earnings and capital impacts. While some of the one-time  noncash charges from DTA revaluations could be significant, the potential  earnings benefit from lower taxes over time could mitigate the one-time capital  impact. The timing and nature of any corporate tax changes remains uncertain; whether  any tax savings would be retained is unclear. Under pro forma assumptions, ROAs  would increase to varying degrees, as illustrated with 25% and 20% effective tax  rate scenarios  - see table below. The effective tax rate for all US bank  holding companies was 30% as of 3Q16.  <iframe  src=""//e.infogr.am/estimated_earnings_under_corporate_tax_scenar ios?src=embed""  title=""Estimated Earnings Under Corporate Tax Scenarios"" width=""550""  height=""499"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0""> Any DTA reductions would be reflected as a charge through income tax expense in  the revaluation period, which would have a negative effect on earnings and  equity. Conversely, downward adjustments to DTLs would decrease income tax  expense and have a positive effect. Therefore, banks with net DTL positions may  benefit the most from a change in the federal tax rate. DTAs at US banks ballooned in the post-crisis period due to net operating  losses, although DTA balances have declined steadily as banks have returned to  profitability. For most banks, DTAs represent an immaterial portion of their  equity, and the median of DTAs as a percentage of total equity was 2.5% among  Fitch-rated banks. <iframe  src=""//e.infogr.am/dtas_as__of_equity_for_fitch_rated_us_banks?s rc=embed""  title=""DTAs as % of Equity for Fitch-Rated US Banks"" width=""550"" height=""791""  scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0""> DTLs are much less common among US banks, although some Fitch-rated banks do  have sizable DTLs relative to total equity. Fitch expects that any DTA revaluation charges will lower bank tangible common  equity ratios. However, regulatory capital ratios and Fitch Core Capital (FCC)  will experience less impact. DTAs relating to net operating loss carryforwards  are already deducted in their entirety from regulatory capital, and DTAs  relating to timing differences over 10% of CET1 capital are also deducted. FCC  is Fitch's primary capital metric and excludes DTAs from losses carried forward  that rely on future profitability to be realized (DTAs relating to timing  differences are not deducted from FCC). On the other hand, a DTL revaluation  will likely result in improved tangible common equity and regulatory capital  ratios for banks with net DTL positions. This is because the reduced DTL will  flow through as a benefit to retained earnings. <iframe  src=""//e.infogr.am/dtls_as__of_equity_for_fitch_rated_us_banks?s rc=embed""  title=""DTLs as % of Equity for Fitch-Rated US Banks"" width=""550"" height=""686""  scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0""> Not all DTAs and DTLs would be affected because changes to the federal corporate  tax rate would not affect DTAs and DTLs arising from state, local or foreign  government taxes.  Fitch believes that any tax reform changes will likely be rating neutral,  although specific proposals and responses from the banks to such changes are  required to analyze the ultimate impact. Any capital impact from DTA/DTL  revaluations is expected to be manageable given its limited effect on FCC.  Whether banks will retain the earnings benefit or return it to shareholders to  fully assess any rating impact also remains to be seen.

245,USB,New chief of Japan's SMBC bank 'actively studying' acquisition of US bank,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The new head of Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) said it is “actively studying” an acquisition of a U.S. bank, as part of efforts to seek a reliable dollar funding source for future growth. Securing cheap, stable dollar funding has been a major challenge for Japanese banks, which have been aggressively expanding overseas as they have been hit by ultra-low interest rates and weak loan demand at home for years. “As we expand globally, a diversified and stable source of the world’s largest hard currency is extremely important,” Makoto Takashima, who was promoted from senior managing director to president on Saturday, told Reuters in an interview.  “Even for our Asia operations, the capability to secure dollar funding is crucial,” he said. He said his bank has been shifting to more stable dollar sources such as deposits by corporate clients from short-term market funding like commercial papers. As a result, the bank’s dollar funding is enough to cover loan demands. “But the core funding source is retail deposits. And to be honest, we want that source when we think about our future growth,” he said. SMBC is a core banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) (8316.T), which posted a 22 percent drop in net profit in the quarter ending in December due to the low interest rate environment. Japanese banks are among the most aggressive buyers of overseas assets in recent years. SMFG spent a total of $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014 to buy 40 percent of PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional Tbk (BTPN.JK) (BTPN) of Indonesia. Unlike cross-town rival Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T), which owns California-based Union Bank, SMFG does not have a retail footprint in the United States. But a recent surge in U.S. financial stocks .SPXBK, up more than 20 percent since early November, has made an acquisition of a U.S. bank too expensive for now, Takashima said. “It would have been feasible right after the collapse of Lehman Brothers (in 2008), when prices were cheap. But an acquisition now would be a very painful burden on our capital,” he said. Takashima, 59, is a life-long insider, starting his career at Sumitomo Bank. A rarity among Japanese bank chiefs, he spent most of his career in international operations, including 11 years in the United States.

He said that he hoped that Britain’s decision to leave the EU would have force the bloc to focus on “fixing its issues,” such as immigration, bureaucracy and rigid labor rules. “Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart,” he said. “We will keep a close eye on the situation in Europe over the next several years.”  ",4052017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-jpmorgan/jpmorgan-softens-tone-on-brexit-jobs-warning-idUSKBN1770W7

249,USB,"U.S., Russian crew lands after six-month stay on space station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - A U.S. astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts made a parachute landing in Kazakhstan on Monday, wrapping up a nearly six-month mission aboard the International Space Station, a NASA TV broadcast showed. The Russian Soyuz capsule, which left the station shortly before 4 a.m. EDT, touched down southeast of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, at 7:20 a.m. EDT. Seated in the capsule were returning station commander Shane Kimbrough of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko from Russian space agency Roscosmos. “It’s really neat to be part of something this big, something bigger than ourselves ... even bigger than a nation,” Kimbrough said during a change-of-command ceremony on Sunday. “We get the ability up here to interact with things that actually benefit all of humanity. It’s really humbling.” Three crew members remain aboard the station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. In command is NASA’s Peggy Whitson, who on April 24 will break the 534-day record for the most time spent in space by a U.S. astronaut. Whitson, a veteran of two previous missions on the station, is the first woman to hold the post of commander twice.  Whitson, Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and France’s Thomas Pesque will be joined by two new crew members on April 20. The U.S. and Russian space agencies agreed last week to extend Whitson’s mission by three months. Russia is reducing its station cadre to two from three members until its new science laboratory launches to the space station next year, the head of Roscosmos said last week at the U.S. Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Whitson will return to Earth in September, having amassed a career U.S. record of 666 days in orbit. Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka, who has 878 days in orbit, is the world’s most experienced space flier. (This story had been refiled to correct paragraph 7 and 8 to show Whitson, Novitskiy and Pesque will be joined by two new crew members.)

251,USB,Exclusive: U.S. offers to fund Mexico heroin fight as 2016 output jumps - U.S. official,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States has offered to help fund Mexico’s efforts to eradicate opium poppies, the U.S. assistant secretary for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) said on Friday, as Mexican heroin output increased again last year.  “We would be prepared to support (opium eradication efforts) should we reach a basic agreement in terms of how they would do more and better eradication in the future,” William Brownfield of INL, part of the State Department, said in an interview.  “That is on the table, but I don’t want you to conclude that it’s a done deal, because we still have to work through the details,” he said, without specifying how much money the United States could provide. The United States is in the midst of an opiates epidemic that has killed tens of thousands of people, and with much of its heroin coming from the mountains of Mexico, the issue has become a key topic of discussion between the Mexican government and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. The U.S. offer to help fund Mexico’s war on poppy cultivation stands in stark contrast to Trump’s threats to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement and force Mexico to pay for a wall along the U.S. border, and reveals the more subtle discussions taking place between the two governments.  Mexico’s president’s office, the Interior Ministry and the Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Speaking on condition of anonymity because the figures are not yet public, a U.S. official said separately that the area of opium poppies under cultivation in Mexico reached 32,000 hectares in 2016, equivalent to about 81 tonnes. In 2015, Mexico had 28,000 hectares under cultivation, almost triple the area in 2012, according to U.S. data. Support for eradicating Mexico’s opium crop could come in various forms, Brownfield said. For example, the U.S. government could provide more vehicles, or pay for helicopter flights to access the isolated, mountainous regions where poppy is grown. “If it’s a matter of having other sorts of equipment, we could talk about support in terms of equipment,” he said. The INL will not write Mexico a blank check but is willing to help fund specific units involved in eradication, he said. Mexico is engaged in fraught discussions with the Trump administration over drug trafficking, trade and immigration, and Trump focused on the heroin scourge in his election campaign. Nonetheless, Brownfield said the two governments were making substantial progress. “Our cooperation with the Mexican government on the heroin challenge is in fact good, and it is better than it has ever been in the past,” he said. Brownfield also confirmed a Reuters report that Mexico’s army is allowing the United States and the United Nations to observe eradication efforts.

261,USB,Fitch: CCAR Results Enables Big Rise in US Bank Capital Payouts,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK/CHICAGO, June 29 (Fitch) The results of the 2017 Comprehensive Capital Adequacy Review (CCAR), alongside the earlier Dodd-Frank Stress Test (DFAST) results, highlight continued capital strength among large U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) and will enable many of them to significantly increase capital payouts, says Fitch Ratings. Fitch has anticipated increased payout ratios and, therefore, they should not have near-term credit implications. The results, released yesterday, marked the first year that the Federal Reserve (the Fed) did not object to any of the tested banks' capital plans. All banks met the quantitative assessment, and those subject to the qualitative assessment were cleared to proceed with their capital return plans. This will mean a substantial rise in the payout ratio from prior years for some firms. Many have already announced increased dividends and share repurchases in response to their CCAR results. This could reverse the trend of continued capital build for some of these banks. The median increase in the total risk-based capital ratio for the firms that fall under the stress tests between last year's and this year's DFAST was 0.5%. However, Fitch does not expect payouts to increase to a level that would lead to meaningful capital erosion. As with last year's stress test, none of the 34 BHCs tested (up from 33 last year) failed to meet the CCAR quantitative assessment. This was the first year where the qualitative assessment of the CCAR excluded BHCs with less than $250 billion in assets and foreign banking organizations. While the 13 firms subject to the qualitative assessment did not receive capital plan objections, Capital One received a conditional non-objection for qualitative reasons and will have to resubmit its capital plan by the end of the year. The Fed noted that there had been general improvement in the capital planning practices and analyses that were measured under the qualitative assessment process. However, it also noted that there were still weaknesses for some firms, particularly in areas pertaining to controls, loss estimation approaches and identification of risks with new products or changes in underwriting standards. In the case of Capital One, the Fed highlighted several areas pertaining to these weaknesses as the reasons for the conditional non-objection. Both Amex and Capital One changed their capital plans following the release of the DFAST results last week. Overall, the combined DFAST and CCAR results underscore the improvements that have been made by large U.S. BHCs in capital planning processes and building regulatory capital in recent years. This has been a key factor underpinning Fitch's view of the resilience of large U.S. banks.

263,USB,"Fitch: USB 2Q17 Earnings Down, Despite Loan Growth and Higher Rates","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 19 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) second quarter 2017 (2Q17) net income of $1.5 billion was down 1.4% year-over-year as growth in net interest income (NII) amid higher short-term interest rates was offset by a decline in non-interest income and incrementally higher expenses, according to Fitch Ratings. USB's return on average assets (ROAA) was a still strong 1.35% in 2Q17 but down 8 basis points from 1.43% in the prior year's quarter. Similarly the company's return on average common equity (ROAE) was 13.4% in 2Q17, down 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2016 (2Q16). Nevertheless this level of operating performance is still at or near the top of the industry. Total net revenue was up 0.7% relative to 2Q16 primarily due to higher NII, which grew 5.9% from 2Q16. This was primarily driven by overall average loan growth of 3.4% relative to 2Q16 and 7.7% year-over-year deposit growth. Surprisingly, the company's net interest margin (NIM) only expanded 2 basis points to 3.04% in 2Q16, up from 3.02% in 2Q17, as it was constrained by a mix of lower yielding assets and some increase in deposit costs. Loan growth in 2Q17 was broad based relative to 2Q16, with average commercial loan growth of 3.8%, average retail loan growth of 6.1%, and average residential mortgage loan growth of 5.5%, partially offset by lower commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth, consistent with the cautionary tone USB's management took on its earnings call regarding perceived risks in multi-family CRE lending. Overall non-interest income declined 5.2% from 2Q16, though the prior year quarter did include a $180 million gain related to the sale of USB's membership interests in Visa Europe Limited to Visa Inc. Higher credit and debit card revenue and higher trust and investment management fees were offset by lower commercial products revenue and lower mortgage banking income, as refinancing activity declined during the quarter. Non-interest expenses grew 1% from 2Q16, though the prior year quarter included $110 million of accruals related to legal and regulatory matters and $40 million for charitable contributions. Excluding these, the year-over-year increase in non-interest expenses would have been 6.4% primarily due to higher compensation costs and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016. Despite the increase in expenses, USB's efficiency ratio remained strong at 55.2% in 2Q17, up from 54.9% in 2Q16. Fitch still considers this to be a solid result and expects the ratio to trend down over the course of the year as there is some levelling off of risk-management and compliance related expenses. Provision expense was $350 million in the quarter, 7% higher than 2Q16, and $10 million higher than net charge-offs (NCOs) in 2Q17. This pushed the allowance for loan losses up to $4.38 billion, which represented 1.58% of period ending loans at 2Q17. Credit quality continues to remain very strong and representing what Fitch considers to be near or at cyclical troughs, though the duration of the trough has extended longer than Fitch's initial expectations. USB's total non-performing assets (NPAs) declined to $1.35 billion in 2Q17, down 19.3% from 2Q16 driven by improvements in commercial energy related exposures, residential mortgages, and real estate owned. USB's ratio of NPAs to loans and other real estate owned was 0.49% in 2Q17, down from 0.62% in 2Q16. NCO's increased by $23 million relative to 2Q16 due to higher credit card charge-offs, but as noted, the NCO ratio was only up 1 basis point in 2Q17 to 0.49% from 0.48% in 2Q16. In 2Q17, USB's fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio under the standardized approach was 9.3%, unchanged from 2Q16, and above the company's 8.5% internal target. During 2Q17 the company returned 81% of earnings to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. The company's internal capital generation was offset by growth in risk-weighted assets due to loans. After receiving a non-objection to its annual capital plan under the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, USB indicated that it plans to repurchase up to $2.6 billion of common stock beginning in the 3Q17 through the end of 2Q18. The firm also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, a 7.1% increase over the current dividend rate.

Otting will oversee big banks such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). He spent more than 30 years as a banker with stints at U.S. Bank and Union Bank and was most recently chief executive officer of OneWest, the California lender started by Mnuchin after the 2008 housing crisis.

279,USB,U.S. bid to include Mexico reform in NAFTA stalls telecom talks,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A U.S. proposal to enshrine measures targeting Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s America Movil thwarted NAFTA negotiators’ goal to reach a deal on telecommunications issues during the latest talks, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. The U.S. proposal would codify Mexico’s telecommunications reform in the North America Free Trade Agreement, including a policy to bar America Movil (AMXL.MX) from charging competitors such as AT&T; (T.N) for calls to its network, the sources said. The policy, a central part of a 2014 effort aimed at loosening Slim’s grip on telecommunications in Mexico, was   later abandoned by the government after the country’s Supreme Court ruled in August that America Movil’s interconnection rates should be set by the telecommunications regulator, not legislators. Slim holds about two-thirds of mobile phone subscriptions in Mexico. The U.S. proposal, which was made during the fourth round of talks and remained on the table in the latest session in Mexico City, was the main sticking point that kept negotiators from reaching agreement on telecommunications, viewed as a rare area of common ground in tough negotiations, the sources said. Spokeswomen for AT&T; and America Movil declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office also declined to comment. Mexican negotiators are unwilling to revisit an issue that has already been settled by the Supreme Court, said Mexican Senator Gerardo Flores, who has been briefed on the proposal. “What Mexico would be willing to capture (in NAFTA) is everything that is in force from the reform,” he said. The court’s decision to side with Slim reshaped the landscape for AT&T;, which entered Mexico after the telecommunications reform.  Mexican officials perceived the U.S. proposal as an attempt to restore more favorable conditions for AT&T.; “It was a gift from Santa Claus to AT&T;,” a Mexican official close to the NAFTA talks said. Mexico was also concerned that the proposal would tie the hands of the regulator, the Federal Institute of Telecommunications, or IFT, the sources said. Responding to the Supreme Court decision, the IFT earlier this month set new interconnection rates, allowing America Movil to bill about a fourth of what competitors can charge. The rates take effect in 2018.  In addition, Mexican negotiators balked at the form of the U.S. proposal, which was structured as a telecom annex that would apply only to Mexico. Mexico wants the key principles of the reform to be captured in the main telecom agreement, which would apply to all three countries, Flores said.  The United States “has an interest in trying to lock in, so to speak, some of the reforms in the treaty so they can’t be undone later on under a different administration,” said Michael Camunez, chief executive of Monarch Global Strategies, which advises firms doing business in Mexico. “But to get this done requires a negotiating posture that seeks to get to an agreement that benefits all parties, and that’s not the posture the U.S. has taken thus far.” ",11272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nafta-telecoms/u-s-bid-to-include-mexico-reform-in-nafta-stalls-telecom-talks-idUSKBN1DR1DF

283,USB,U.S. Bancorp edges past earnings estimates on strong loan growth,"(Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp’s (USB.N) fourth-quarter earnings edged past analysts’ forecasts on Wednesday, as the biggest U.S. regional bank by assets lent more and benefited from higher interest rates. Its net interest income rose 6.4 percent to $3.14 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Average loans rose 2.6 percent to $279.75 billion, a result that some analysts cheered, while others said was in line with expectations. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times in 2017. Policymakers are expected to maintain that pace through this year and the next. However, U.S. Bancorp’s shares fell 3 percent to $55.45 in morning trading after the bank said its expenses would grow in the mid-single percentage digits year-over-year in 2018. The company had previously forecast expenses to increase 3 to 5 percent, said Wedbush Securities analyst Peter Winter. Signaling more expenses ahead, U.S. Bancorp Chief Financial Officer Terrance Dolan said his company would invest about 25 percent of any tax benefit it may receive into initiatives including technology, automation and employee benefits. The Minneapolis-based bank said it recorded a one-time benefit of $910 million related to the new U.S. federal tax law. U.S. Bancorp joins peer PNC Financial (PNC.N) in booking a gain from the new tax code, in contrast to most bigger banks including Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) which have reported multi-billion-dollar charges due to the new laws. U.S. Bancorp said net income attributable to common shareholders rose 16 percent to $1.61 billion or 97 cents per share, benefiting mainly from the tax-related gain. Excluding the gain and other one-time items, the bank earned 88 cents per share, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of 87 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 3.7 percent to $5.64 billion. Shares of other banks also fell on Wednesday morning following quarterly reports from Goldman and Bank of America.

288,USB,U.S. Bancorp to pay $613 million for money-laundering violations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has reached a $613 million settlement with U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) over charges that it willfully failed to have an adequate anti-money-laundering program, the department said on Thursday. As part of the settlement, U.S. Bancorp agreed to forfeit $453 million and to pay fines to the Treasury Department, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, the Justice Department said in a statement. It said that the bank, through its subsidiary U.S. Bank National Association, deliberately ran an inadequate anti-money-laundering program from 2009 to 2014. U.S. Bancorp failed to detect large numbers of suspicious transactions and concealed its missteps from regulators, it said. “We regret and have accepted responsibility for the past deficiencies in our AML (anti-money-laundering) program. Our culture of ethics and integrity demands that we do better,” President and Chief Executive Andy Cecere said in a statement. Under the settlement, the Justice Department agreed to dismiss the charges against the Minneapolis-based bank in two years if it meets the terms of the agreement. The bank said it has overhauled its anti-money-laundering policies in recent years to address the issues. The Justice Department said the bank limited the number of transactions its systems would flag as suspicious based on its staffing levels. A 2009 memo from the bank’s anti-money laundering officer warned that staff was “stretched dangerously thin,” and U.S. Bancorp hid its limitations from regulators, it said. The Justice Department also claimed the bank processed Western Union transactions for non-customers, even though those transactions would not be monitored. The bank barred those wire transfers in 2014. Authorities also charged that the bank willfully failed to report suspicious banking activities of a longtime customer, Scott Tucker, from 2011 to 2013. Tucker, who ran a payday lending business through various Native American tribes, ran roughly $2 billion through the bank’s accounts. He was convicted in October of charges tied to that business, although he intends to appeal. The Justice Department statement said the bank overlooked several red flags from Tucker’s business, including using accounts bearing the names of tribes for his personal expenses, such as a vacation home and a Ferrari racing team. The bank did not flag any of Tucker’s activity to regulators as suspicious until served with a Justice Department subpoena in 2013. The Justice Department recommended that the $453 million forfeiture be remitted to people who took out high-interest loans with Tucker.
