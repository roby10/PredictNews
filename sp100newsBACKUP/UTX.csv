1,UTX,UPDATE 2-EU court cuts ThyssenKrupp fine by a third," * ThyssenKrupp fine cut to 319.78 million euros   * EU court upholds antitrust fines for Schindler, Otis   * Fines for Kone, Mitsubishi Elevator Europe remain   * Schindler to appeal, Kone to review ruling before deciding   * ThyssenKrupp shares rise slightly, outperform index   (Adds ThyssenKrupp, Kone, Commission, lawyer comments)   By Michele Sinner        LUXEMBOURG, July 13 (Reuters) - ThyssenKrupp won a 33 percent cut in an antitrust fine to 319.78 million euros ($457.3 million) after a top European court said EU regulators had wrongly penalised the parent group and several subsidiaries.   The European Commission had fined the German industrial group and four other companies a total 992.31 million euros in 2007 — a record at the time — for running an escalator and lift cartel in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.    ThyssenKrupp’s 479.67 million euro fine was the largest. The Commission had increased by 50 percent the fines on the parent company and several of its subsidiaries for repeated offences.    “The Court points out that the Commission had, in an earlier decision, made a finding of infringement solely against those companies, but not against their parent companies at the material time, of which ThyssenKrupp AG is the economic and legal successor,” the EU’s General Court said on Wednesday .   The court, Europe’s second-highest, said it was also not clear that several ThyssenKrupp subsidiaries penalised in a separate case could be considered repeat offenders in the elevator cartel.        The ruling, the third in a row where the court has scrapped or reduced regulatory fines, showed judges were taking a harder look at the Commission’s practices and decisions, said Marc Reysen, a partner at law firm O’Melveny & Myers in Brussels.    “In all three cases, the court is saying, ‘Commission, you haven’t done your job well enough.’ This is a recent trend, the court has generally taken a fairly hands-off attitude for cartel decisions,” he said.        “There is a lot of criticism, to some extent justified, of the way the Commission conducts its investigations. The criticism has raised awareness. The Commission, to be fair, has improved its practices, but it has some way to go.”        The Commission welcomed the verdict, saying that it largely upheld its 2007 decision.        ThyssenKrupp said it was happy with the verdict.        “We welcome it that the European court has adopted part of our argument and has determined that the supplemental fine for repeat offenders was not a justified one for ThyssenKrupp,” the company said in a statement.        The court upheld Schindler’s fine of 143.78 million euros, a 224.93 million euro penalty for Otis, owned by United Technologies of the U.S., Finnish peer Kone’s 142.12 million euro fine and Mitsubishi Electric of Japan’s 1.84 million euro penalty.        Kone said it would study the ruling before deciding whether to take further action, while Schindler said it would appeal to the European Court of Justice, Europe’s highest court.         ThyssenKrupp’s shares were trading 1.2 percent higher at 32 euros by 1208 GMT, outperforming a 0.8 percent rise in the Stoxx 600 industrial groups and services index . Schindler was 0.3 percent up while Kone gained 2.1 percent.        Regulators had charged the companies with fixing prices, sharing markets and rigging bids for procurement contracts between 1995 and 2004, possibly distorting the markets for years to come.

But the General Court backed the European Commission’s fines on Swiss lift maker Schindler (SCHN.S), Otis, owned by United Technologies (UTX.N) of the United States, Finnish peer Kone (KNEBV.HE) and Mitsubishi Electric of Japan.   “The Court concludes that, in this instance, the infringements found by the Commission (with regard to ThyssenKrupp) cannot be considered to be repeated infringement by the same undertakings,” the Court said on Wednesday.

3,UTX,"UPDATE 1-Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney settle patent battle"," * Rivals had charged patent infringement   * Companies decline to comment on terms of settlement  (Adds confirmation from Pratt & Whitney)   LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - Britain’s Rolls-Royce (RR.L) and U.S. rival Pratt & Whitney have settled a legal dispute over patents on jet engines, in a case that threatened to delay deliveries of Boeing Co’s (BA.N) new 787 aircraft.   Rolls and P&W, which is owned by United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), said on Tuesday they dropped lawsuits against each other over disputes surrounding Rolls’ Trent 900 and 1000 engines and the GP7200 engine, developed by P&W and General Electric (GE.N).   “We have reached an amicable, confidential settlement agreement resulting in dismissal of all patent litigation between the parties,” a Rolls-Royce spokesman told Reuters.   Pratt spokeswoman Katy Padgett confirmed the settlement but declined to elaborate.   P&W last year accused Rolls of copying turbine blade technology used on its Trent 900 and 1000 engines. Pratt also asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to block Boeing from importing the Trent 1000, which powers its new 787 Dreamliner jet.   Another lawsuit centered on a patent dispute over P&W and GE’s GP7200 engine.   Rolls and P&W are part of the International Aero Engines alliance — a joint venture including Germany’s MTU and Japanese Aero Engines — to produce the V2500 turbofan.

4,UTX,UPDATE 1-Bombardier drops on threat posed by Boeing engine,"   *  Bombardier’s new C-Series plane is competitor   * Bombardier stock down as much as 1.9 pct   * C-Series has been slow to win orders   * Engine maker Pratt & Whitney parent eyes AMR order  (Recasts; adds engine makers and updates stock price)   VANCOUVER, July 20 (Reuters) - Shares of Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) dropped on Wednesday after Boeing Co (BA.N) said it would offer a revamped engine in its best-selling 737 aircraft, a decision that threatens the Canadian company’s new C-Series.   Boeing’s new engine was announced as part of a massive $40 billion aircraft order placed on Wednesday by AMR Corp AMR.N for 200 Boeing 737s and 260 Airbus EAD.PA A320s for its American Airlines unit. [ID:nLDE76J0T1]   “Investors will likely react negatively to the announcement as they may be disappointed that Bombardier missed out on this large order,” CIBC World Markets analyst Michael Willemse said.   Orders have trickled in for Bombardier’s new C-Series aircraft, the world No. 3 planemaker’s bold, C$3 billion ($3.2 billion) foray into a bigger-sized plane.   The C-Series, aimed at the 110-149 seat market, is due to enter service at the end of 2013 and will compete with Boeing’s smaller 737-700 plane and Airbus’ A319neo.   A key selling point of the C-Series has been its new, more efficient engine, which will lower operating costs. But a re-engined Boeing 737-700 as well as Airbus’ A319neo, which also boasts of lower operating costs, will reduce some of Bombardier’s advantage, BMO Capital Markets analyst Fadi Chamoun said.   Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), is the exclusive engine maker for the C-Series. The PW1500G series engines promise double-digit improvements in fuel-efficiency, environmental emissions and noise.   AMR has not yet said what engines it wants on the Airbus and Boeing jets it is ordering. A UTC executive said on Wednesday it believes its geared turbofan engine — the same as the one used on the C-Series — has a “great shot” of winning a role in the order. [ID:nN1E76J07N]   Boeing had put off a decision on how to upgrade its 737 for more than a year, causing customers to cast an eye at alternatives such as Bombardier’s C-Series and Airbus’s A319neo.   “We suspect that core Boeing customers that were hitherto considering fleet replacement alternatives in the absence of a near-term solution from Boeing, will likely strongly consider staying the course,” UBS Securities analyst Tasneem Azim said in a note to clients.   Montreal-based Bombardier managed to secure 30 firm orders for its CSeries at the time of the Paris Air Show in June. That brings to 123 the number of firm orders for the CS100 and CS300 models.   Bombardier shares were down 1.9 percent at C$6.32 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday afternoon.   Separately Bombardier said it will supply an additional 300 rapid transit cars to the Chicago Transit Authority in a new order valued at $331 million. [ID:nN1E76J0FX]   The order brings the value of Bombardier’s contract with the CTA, first announced in 2006, to about $1 billion. The 5000-series rail cars will replace older models. They are being manufactured at Bombardier’s plant in Plattsburgh, New York, the company said.

5,UTX,Strong foreign demand drives U.S. manufacturers,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong demand from emerging markets is driving profit growth for U.S. manufacturers this year, but executives do not expect that to be much of a lift for the sluggish U.S. economy.  In fact, a top executive at United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) attributed the 18.9 percent rise in profit at the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners partly to the company’s ability to hold the line on hiring.  “We’ve driven all this cost out. Sales have come back, but people have not,” said Greg Hayes, chief financial officer at the Hartford, Connecticut-based company. “It’s the structural cost reductions that we have done over the past few years that have allowed us to see strong bottom-line results.  While the company is adding some engineers in the United States, it is doing most of its hiring right now in emerging markets where demand for its products is growing.  “Until you see a big resurgence in consumer spending in the United States, I don’t think you’re going to see a big improvement in the employment picture,” Hayes said.  Stubbornly high unemployment — which has held between 9 and 10 percent for most of the past two years — stands as one of the top problems facing the U.S. economy and is shaping up as a key issue in next year’s presidential election.  Big U.S. employers continue to cut. This week, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) said they would cut some 18,000 workers from their payrolls.  Big companies such as United Tech and Textron Inc (TXT.N), which also reported better-than-expected profit on Wednesday, have turned more of their focus overseas to markets where demand is growing, investors said.  “Domestic uncertainty is not holding back Carrier and Otis segments internationally,” said Tim Hoyle, the director of research at Haverford Quality Investing, referring to United Tech’s air-conditioning and elevator units.  “Growth in emerging markets’ airlines (helps) Pratt & Whitney,” added Hoyle, whose Radnor, Pennsylvania-based company manages more than $6 billion and holds United Tech shares.  United Tech posted earnings that came in 4 cents per share ahead of analysts’ forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and raised its full-year forecast for the third time since December.  TE Connectivity Ltd (TEL.N), a U.S. maker of electronic connectors previously known as Tyco Electronics, also posted better-than-expected results, saying that telecommunications companies in Australia, China and Europe are making big investments in broadband networks outside the United States, driving demand for its products.  “These companies have been exhibiting really strong profitability in a very difficult economic environment,” said Catherine Maniscalco Avery, president and CEO of CAIM LLC, which invests in dividend-paying stocks.  Makers of aircraft, engines and aviation components got a big boost on Wednesday when No. 3 U.S. airline American Airlines, owned by AMR Corp AMR.N, unveiled a $40 billion order for at least 460 narrowbody jets from Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus EAD.PA running from 2013 through 2022.  That news could provide a long-term lift for companies, including United Tech, as well as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which make aviation components and are due to report results on Friday.  Boeing offered a new engine on the 737 — the LEAP-X, produced by an alliance of GE and France’s Safran SA (SAF.PA) — to clinch the order and avoid losing more ground to archrival Airbus. Investors fretted the move, which came after Boeing considered entirely redesigning the 737, boxed United Tech’s Pratt & Whitney arm out of that side of the deal.  “Go back a few months ago and the expectation was Boeing would go with an all-new plane and keep Pratt in the running,” said Matt Collins, a capital goods analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “I think this AMR situation forced their hand.”  United Tech shares were down 3 percent at $86.14 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange.  Demand for corporate jets, which has been slow to recover since a precipitous drop during the financial crisis, is starting to show signs of turning, said the head of Textron, which is the world’s largest maker of business jets.  “We expect a significant pick-up in demand in the second half of the year, similar to what we saw last year,” said Scott Donnelly, chief executive of Textron, which also topped analysts’ forecasts, but held its full-year forecast steady.  Textron shares were up 9 percent at $24.09 and TE Connectivity was up 1.6 percent at $35.93. Both trade on the NYSE.

8,UTX,GE expected to report 13 percent rise in profit,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Analysts expect General Electric Co (GE.N) to report a 13 percent rise in net profit on Friday, with strong demand from emerging markets continuing to offset weak U.S. demand and its slimmed-down finance arm.  The largest U.S. conglomerate is experiencing strong demand for a variety of its heavy equipment, from aircraft engines, to gas turbines, to gear used in producing oil and natural gas, company officials have said.  “Business is good,” Chief Executive Office Jeff Immelt told reporters in Greenville, South Carolina, last week. “You have this backdrop of tremendous demand.”  That tremendous demand is largely coming from key emerging markets such as China, Brazil and parts of the Middle East. Demand at home is spottier, particularly for consumer products, due to lingering high U.S. unemployment and low home prices. GE does more than half its business outside the United States.  The gap between strength in the developing world and sluggishness at home has colored earnings reports across the industrial sector this quarter. United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), which generates about 60 percent of its revenue outside the United States, topped analysts’ forecasts this week, while Ingersoll Rand Plc (IR.N), which has a large residential air conditioner business, missed.  Wall Street expects GE to report a net profit of $3.43 billion, earnings per share of 32 cents and $34.7 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The revenue target implies a 7 percent drop, which reflects the company’s continuing drive to scale back its GE Capital finance arm.

The largest U.S. conglomerate said on Friday second-quarter profit attributable to common shareholders came to $3.69 billion, or 35 cents per share, compared with $3.03 billion, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.

11,UTX,Analysis: Companies churn out profits but jobs don't follow,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The sluggish pace of hiring may be hobbling the economy, but it’s not been holding back big U.S. companies’ profits thanks to growth overseas and cost controls at home. And that’s bad news for the more than 14 million Americans without jobs.  Big businesses would normally be desperate for surging job growth as it would feed into domestic demand but these aren’t normal times. Massive growth opportunities overseas, especially in China and other buoyant Asian economies, have some of the largest American companies on track for record profits, even if they’re businesses are mostly treading water in the U.S.  The message last week from the chief financial officer of one of the nation’s industrial giants couldn’t be clearer.  “We’ve driven all this cost out. Sales have come back, but people have not,” said Greg Haynes, chief financial officer at United Technologies Corp. “It’s the structural cost reductions that we have done over the past few years that have allowed us to see strong bottom-line results.”  The company, the world’s largest maker of air conditioners and elevators, said second-quarter profit rose 19 percent, and it is doing most of its hiring in emerging markets where demand for its products is growing fastest.  It isn’t alone in seeing profits climb in the current earnings reporting season.  About 78 percent of companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index that have reported second-quarter earnings have beaten Wall Street expectations. Many benefited after slashing costs when the financial crisis hit and then keeping tight control on them even as sales recovered.  Economists say the ability to do more with less has helped create a two-speed U.S. recovery. The S&P 500 has doubled in value since the recession ended and per-share earnings are currently on track for a new annual record, while employment remains below the level seen in late 2008 when corporate profits troughed.  Employers added fewer jobs in June than at any time in the past nine months, and the jobless rate rose to 9.2 percent - higher than when the recession ended in early 2009.  “We’ve never seen the kind of shedding of jobs that we saw in this recession. America’s corporations have never been running so efficiently,” said Ellen Zentner, senior U.S. economist at Nomura Securities in New York.  What’s more, workers have never claimed such a paltry share of real national income growth. Economists at Northeastern University in Boston recently found corporate profits captured 88 percent of income growth between the second quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010.  Workers’ take? Slightly more than 1 percent.  “The only major beneficiaries of the recovery have been corporate profits and the stock market and its shareholders,” the study concludes.  The high jobless rate is also keeping wage growth severely restrained in the U.S., which is also good for profit margins.  Recent Department of Labor data showed unit labor costs edged up 0.7 percent in the year to March, though not enough to make up a 2.9 percent decline in the prior 12-month period.  Northeastern economics professor Andrew Sum called the mismatch “historically unprecedented” and said it bodes ill for future growth, especially given many companies are sitting on their cash rather than investing it.  “Workers have no money, no purchasing power, so that’s why consumption is not moving,” he said. By sitting on profits, firms are acting like earners “who take their money and stuff it in the mattress. That’s happening across the economy.”  U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter and was expected to remain below 2 percent in the May-June period.  Some blamed that on high energy prices and supply shortages caused by Japan’s earthquake and are betting on a rebound in the second half.  A July Reuters poll put the median estimate for 2011 growth at 2.7 percent, down from 2.9 percent in 2010.  Businesses’ ability to do more with the same or less — what economists term increased productivity — has been rising since the 1990s, thanks partly to technological advancements and the ability to tap markets in fast-growing, lower-cost developing countries.  Some of the most profitable firms are those with overseas markets. The largest U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co. tied its 21.6 percent rise in earnings partly to strong foreign demand for its heavy equipment, including jet engines and electric turbines.  In the United States, things are obviously different.

12,UTX,UPDATE 1-Embraer picks IAE as engine supplier for cargo plane," * Announcement comes amid worries over commercial aircraft   * Embraer focusing on defense to diversify revenue stream   * Deliveries of V2500-E5 engine expected by 2013-statement  (Adds background, share performance in paragraphs 3-5)   SAO PAULO, July 25 (Reuters) - Embraer (EMBR3.SA)(ERJ.N), the world’s biggest maker of regional aircraft, chose International Aero Engines as engine supplier for its military transport plane KC-390, signaling that the company is moving ahead in its venture into defense within schedule.   Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil-based Embraer said in a statement on Monday that first deliveries of the V2500-E5 engine should begin in 2013. IAE is a multinational consortium formed by Rolls-Royce (RR.L), United Technologies (UTX.N) unit Pratt & Whitney and the Japanese Aero Engine Corp, among others.   “The choice of the first suppliers is key for us to start the project in this new, more advanced phase,” Luiz Carlos Aguiar, head of Embraer’s defense unit, said in the statement.   Embraer is betting on defense as geopolitical events lead Brazil and other countries to beef up security to protect extensive natural resources. Aguiar, Embraer’s former chief financial officer, took over the defense unit in December to boost defense revenue from about 10 percent of total sales.   Chief Executive Frederico Curado told Reuters in a recent interview that he wished to see revenue from defense at about 20 percent in coming years.   Still, the engine announcement comes as investors wait for Curado’s decision on whether Embraer plans to build a new family of commercial jets. The decision is key because Embraer lacks a comprehensive offering of planes in the large commercial jet market — which hinders its ability to win orders from airlines looking to buy aircraft of multiple sizes from one provider.   Deliveries of the first defense cargo airplane, known as the KC-390, are expected by the end of 2015, and analysts have predicted prices of between $80 million and $100 million per aircraft.   Voting shares of Embraer fell 1.2 percent to 11.22 reais in Sao Paulo on Monday, while its U.S.-traded shares fell for a second straight session, shedding 0.3 percent to $29.58.

15,UTX,Companies churn out profits but not jobs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The sluggish pace of hiring may be hobbling the U.S. economy, but it’s not been holding back big U.S. companies’ profits thanks to growth overseas and cost controls at home. And that’s bad news for the more than 14 million Americans without jobs.  Big businesses would normally be desperate for surging job growth as it would feed into domestic demand but these aren’t normal times. Massive growth opportunities overseas, especially in China and other buoyant Asian economies, have some of the largest American companies on track for record profits, even if they’re businesses are mostly treading water in the U.S.  The message last week from the chief financial officer of one of the nation’s industrial giants couldn’t be clearer.  “We’ve driven all this cost out. Sales have come back, but people have not,” said Greg Hayes, chief financial officer at United Technologies Corp. “It’s the structural cost reductions that we have done over the past few years that have allowed us to see strong bottom-line results.  The company, the world’s largest maker of air conditioners and elevators, said second-quarter profit rose 19 percent, and it is doing most of its hiring in emerging markets where demand for its products is growing fastest.  It isn’t alone in seeing profits climb in the current earnings reporting season.  About 78 percent of companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index that have reported second-quarter earnings have beaten Wall Street expectations. Many benefited after slashing costs when the financial crisis hit and then keeping tight control on them even as sales recovered.  Economists say the ability to do more with less has helped create a two-speed U.S. recovery. The S&P 500 has doubled in value since the recession ended and per-share earnings are currently on track for a new annual record, while employment remains below the level seen in late 2008 when corporate profits troughed.  Employers added fewer jobs in June than at any time in the past nine months, and the jobless rate rose to 9.2 percent - not far below its level of 9.5 percent in June 2009 when the recession ended.  “We’ve never seen the kind of shedding of jobs that we saw in this recession. America’s corporations have never been running so efficiently,” said Ellen Zentner, senior U.S. economist at Nomura Securities in New York.  What’s more, workers have never claimed such a paltry share of real national income growth. Economists at Northeastern University in Boston recently found corporate profits captured 88 percent of income growth between the second quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010.  Workers’ take? Slightly more than 1 percent.  “The only major beneficiaries of the recovery have been corporate profits and the stock market and its shareholders,” the study concludes.  The high jobless rate is also keeping wage growth severely restrained in the U.S., which is also good for profit margins.  Recent Department of Labor data showed unit labor costs edged up 0.7 percent in the year to March, though not enough to make up a 2.9 percent decline in the prior 12-month period.  Northeastern economics professor Andrew Sum called the mismatch “historically unprecedented” and said it bodes ill for future growth, especially given many companies are sitting on their cash rather than investing it.  “Workers have no money, no purchasing power, so that’s why consumption is not moving,” he said. By sitting on profits, firms are acting like earners “who take their money and stuff it in the mattress. That’s happening across the economy.”  U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter and was expected to remain below 2 percent in the April-June period.  Some blamed that on high energy prices and supply shortages caused by Japan’s earthquake and are betting on a rebound in the second half.  A July Reuters poll put the median estimate for 2011 growth at 2.7 percent, down from 2.9 percent in 2010.  Businesses’ ability to do more with the same or less — what economists term increased productivity — has been rising since the 1990s, thanks partly to technological advancements and the ability to tap markets in fast-growing, lower-cost developing countries.  Some of the most profitable firms are those with overseas markets. The largest U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co. tied its 21.6 percent rise in earnings partly to strong foreign demand for its heavy equipment, including jet engines and electric turbines.  In the United States, things are obviously different. Consumers are still trying to pay down large debts built up during the boom years, which suppresses spending and means there is little incentive for companies to hire.  “It’s a chicken-and-egg thing — whether demand or supply drives growth,” Zentner said. “Studies show that lack of sales for small business is the biggest impediment to hiring.”  Even companies selling basic consumer products are feeling the pinch as the jobless and those on low incomes watch the pennies.

16,UTX,Consumer markets hurt some industrial earnings,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Disappointed investors dumped shares of several large U.S. industrial and transport companies after they warned of weak consumer markets, especially in the United States.  3M Co's (MMM.N) earnings met Wall Street forecasts, and the global conglomerate reported strong industrial demand, but also had sharply lower sales in its display and graphics division. Its shares were down 4.8 percent at $90.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI at midday on Tuesday.  3M’s report was one of several early alarm bells about demand in the second half of 2011, amid persistently high unemployment, a U.S. housing market at multi-year lows, and a political impasse over the debt ceiling.  If U.S. and global economies slow down, cyclical manufacturers may be one of the first sectors where that slowdown will be visible. Near-term profit expectations may come down, said industrials analyst Jeff Windau of Edward Jones.  “Even with some warning signs and potential economic slowing, we still have high expectations,” Windau said. “You see some signs of weakness. The consumer is the most obvious.”  3M said Japan’s March earthquake had reduced sales and profit margins in its display and graphics division, which makes specialty films for computers and televisions. Lower consumer spending was also a factor.  “The LCD TV business is ... going through one of those down cycles that reflect inventory corrections and, ultimately, a less robust consumer end market,” 3M Chief Executive George Buckley told analysts.  Expectations were fairly high for 3M, said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland. It met estimates because of a weaker dollar and a boost from acquisitions.  “Display and graphics was the weak spot and that’s a consumer item,” Klein said. “That just speaks to the pullback by consumers. It’s not unexpected, but it’s a concern.”  A wider index of U.S. capital goods companies .GSPI was down 1.8 percent. The sour mood affected even companies whose earnings came in ahead of expectations, like Pentair (PNR.N), a maker of filtration and electrical systems whose third-quarter profit outlook disappointed.  Warning signs were not limited to industrial names.  Texas Instruments TXN.N on Monday gave a lukewarm outlook, suggesting back-to-school sales of computers and other electronics would be weaker than normal.  ARM Holdings ARM.L also sounded a note of caution about electronic goods sales this coming Christmas, overshadowing a better-than-expected second quarter.  And Ford Motor (F.N) trimmed its forecast for industry auto sales in North America even as its profit topped expectations on strong pricing.  Shares of United Parcel Service were down 4.7 percent at $70.54 after a modest earnings beat. The world’s largest package delivery company, whose iconic brown trucks carry some 6 percent of the U.S. economy, said it was cautious about its upcoming peak shipping season.  “We have to get unemployment rates down in this country to get consumer confidence up,” CEO Scott Davis said.  Steel and aluminum companies have reported stronger demand from some industrial sectors, but said profits are still constrained by weakness in residential and non-residential construction in Europe and North America.  AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS.N) said it expected a sharp fall in third-quarter operating profit. U.S. Steel (X.N), the biggest U.S. steelmaker, also expects a lower third-quarter profit. Shares of both companies fell.  Though earnings from companies affected by consumer spending hinted at a slowdown, other signs suggested shoppers remain resilient. U.S. stocks pared losses as a better-than-expected reading on consumer confidence boosted investor optimism.  Several other manufacturing names missed profit forecasts.  Illinois Tool Works Inc (ITW.N) missed Wall Street estimates and the industrial conglomerate said it expected moderating demand in the second half of the year, sending its stock down 8.3 percent to $52.28.  Truck maker Paccar (PCAR.O) cited economic uncertainty when it lowered its estimate of this year’s heavy-duty truck production in North America.  Carlisle Cos Inc’s (CSL.N) profit was hurt by raw material costs. Shares of the maker of roofing materials, specialty wheels and food equipment were down 10 percent at $43.76.  Lennox International (LII.N), which makes furnaces and air conditioners, cut its outlook. Earnings missed forecasts by a wide margin, and shares fell 8.6 percent to $37.66.  A bright spot in U.S. industrial earnings was Cummins Inc (CMI.N), which credited strong international markets for its profit growth. The diesel engine maker said demand from truck, mining and energy markets remained strong and raised its earnings forecast.

18,UTX,"Cummins profit beats expectations, raises outlook","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Diesel engine maker Cummins Inc (CMI.N) raised its 2011 outlook after a strong second-quarter profit that beat Wall Street expectations and sent its shares higher.  Cummins, which also makes power generation equipment and filtration systems, warned of a near-term slowdown in China. It said measures taken by the Chinese government to control inflation have hit demand for its engines used in trucks and off-highway markets.  But the company sees the fall in demand as just a correction and will continue with its plans to add capacity in the Chinese market, Chief Operating Officer Tom Linebarger said on a conference call with analysts.  The third quarter will likely be the low point, and improvement will be seen again in the fourth quarter, Linebarger said.  Cummins shares were boosted by the profit beat from strong growth across all its segments and international markets, and were up 4.3 percent in late morning trading to $111.28.  Last week, heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), which competes with Cummins in some markets, said economic growth in the United States and other developed economies was weaker than expected and reported signs of a slowdown in China.  Higher interest rates and other policy moves to tame inflation have raised concerns among investors that China’s growth could slow abruptly.  Cummins expects strong growth in Brazil and India, and for its power products in China.  Manufacturers such as Cummins and United Technologies (UTX.N), which have greater exposure to international markets, have posted better results in their most recent quarters than companies like Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), which have significant exposure to U.S. consumers.  Cummins’ second-quarter earnings rose to $505 million, or $2.60 a share, from $246 million, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier.  Excluding some gains, the company earned $2.41 a share, beating Wall Street expectations of $2.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

20,UTX,Consumer markets hurt some industrial earnings,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Disappointed investors dumped shares of several large U.S. industrial and transport companies after they warned of weak consumer markets, especially in the United States.  3M Co's (MMM.N) earnings met Wall Street forecasts, and the global conglomerate reported strong industrial demand, but sharply lower sales in its display and graphics division. Its shares fell more than 4 percent on Tuesday, dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI.  3M said Japan’s March earthquake had reduced sales and profit margins in the display and graphics division, which makes specialty films for computers and televisions.  “If everybody else is beating and you’re not, you lose,” said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co. “It’s a relative beauty contest.”  Industrial peers W.W. Grainger (GWW.N), United Technologies (UTX.N), General Electric (GE.N), and Danaher (DHR.N) beat expectations this quarter, Langenberg said, while 3M’s display and graphics business missed on both sales and profits, in part because of production disruptions in Japan.  3M Chief Executive Officer George Buckley tied weakness in that segment to lower consumer spending.  “The LCD TV business is ... simply going through one of those down cycles that reflect inventory corrections and, ultimately, a less robust consumer end market,” Buckley said on a conference call.  Expectations were pretty high for 3M, said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland.  3M met Wall Street earnings estimates partly because of a weaker dollar and a boost from acquisitions “so maybe the quality of that wasn’t as high as people may have wanted to see,” Klein said.  “Display and graphics was the weak spot and that’s a consumer item,” Klein said. “That just speaks to the pullback by consumers. It’s not unexpected, but it’s a concern.”  Increases in raw material costs also pinched margins, as 3M could not recoup them through price increases.

The world’s largest package delivery company, whose results are a closely watched indicator of consumer demand, said it was cautious about its upcoming peak shipping season.  Illinois Tool Works Inc’s (ITW.N) quarterly profit missed Wall Street forecasts, and the industrial conglomerate said it expected moderating demand in the second half of the year, sending its stock down more than 7 percent.  Among other results on Tuesday, truck maker Paccar (PCAR.O) cited economic uncertainty when it lowered its estimate of this year’s heavy-duty truck production in North America.  Lennox International (LII.N), which makes furnaces and air conditioners, posted lower sales in its residential equipment unit and cut its outlook. Earnings missed Wall Street forecasts by a wide margin, and its shares fell nearly 8 percent.  A bright spot in U.S. industrial earnings was Cummins Inc (CMI.N), which credited strong international markets for its profit growth.

21,UTX,"Cummins quarterly profit beats, raises outlook","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cummins Inc (CMI.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday on strong growth across all its segments and international markets, and the diesel engine maker raised its 2011 outlook.  Shares of the company, which also makes power generation equipment and filtration systems, rose nearly 6 percent.  Second-quarter earnings rose to $505 million, or $2.60 a share, from $246 million, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier.  Excluding some gains, the company earned $2.41 a share, beating Wall Street expectations of $2.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Sales rose 45 percent to $4.64 billion, exceeding analysts’ estimates of $4.27 billion.  “This is one of the best results to come out so far (among industrials),” said Morningstar analyst Basili Alukos.  He said the company was probably gaining market share in emerging markets like China.  Cummins raised its 2011 forecast for profit margin before interest and taxes to 14.5 percent from 14 percent and its sales outlook for the year to $18 billion from $17 billion.  Engine sales rose 53 percent in the second quarter on strong truck, mining, and oil and gas markets. The company, which gets almost two-thirds of its revenue from the international markets, also had strong sales in Brazil, India and China.  Manufacturers such as Cummins and United Technologies (UTX.N), which have greater exposure to international markets, have posted better results in their most recent quarters than companies like Ingersoll Rand Plc (IR.N), which have significant exposure to U.S. consumers.  Last week, heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), which competes with Cummins in some markets, said economic growth in the United States and other developed economies was weaker than expected and reported signs of a slowdown in China.",7262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cummins/cummins-quarterly-profit-beats-raises-outlook-idUSTRE76P3TO20110726
22,UTX,UPDATE 3-3M profit meets forecasts; Japan hurts margins," * Q2 EPS $1.60 in line with estimates   * Q2 sales up 14 pct to $7.68 bln   * Sees 2011 EPS ex-items $6.32 to $6.47   * Shares down 3.3 percent  (Rewrites first paragraph; adds analyst comment, byline)   By Nick Zieminski   NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - 3M Co’s (MMM.N) quarterly profit met Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, but its shares fell more than 3 percent as some investors were disappointed that the company did not follow the lead of its industrial peers with an earnings beat.   3M, whose products range from consumer goods like Post-It Notes to specialty films for computers and televisions, reported strong industrial demand but lower sales in its displays and graphics division, and the conglomerate said Japan’s March earthquake had reduced sales and profit margins.   “If everybody else is beating and you’re not, you lose,” said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co. “It’s a relative beauty contest.”   Industrial peers W.W. Grainger (GWW.N), United Technologies (UTX.N), General Electric (GE.N), and Danaher (DHR.N) beat expectations this quarter, Langenberg said, while 3M’s display and graphics business missed on both sales and profits, hurt in part by production disruptions in Japan.   Net earnings rose to $1.16 billion, or $1.60 per share, in the second quarter from $1.12 billion, or $1.54 per share, a year earlier.   While earnings only met analyst expectations, 3M’s sales growth exceeded them. Sales rose 14 percent to a record $7.68 billion, above Wall Street forecasts of $7.60 billion.   The weaker U.S. dollar helped boost revenue, while a lower-than-expected tax rate supported earnings, several analysts noted.   The industrial and transportation segments showed the strongest sales growth, up 18 percent, while sales of consumer and office goods rose 4 percent. The only sales decline was in 3M’s display and graphics segment, down 11 percent, partly reflecting lower production of liquid crystal displays.   “A larger-than-anticipated contraction in LCD TV end-market demand affected our sales, reflecting a tighter consumer electronics market,” 3M Chief Executive Officer George Buckley said.   Shares of 3M, part of the Dow Jones industrial average, were down 3.3 percent at $91.95 shortly before the market opened. The stock has outperformed its industrial peers since early June.   3M, which has greater exposure to Japan than most of its peers, said the March earthquake, which shut production of autos and consumer electronics, reduced quarterly earnings by 7 cents a share and hurt operating margins by half a percentage point. It expects the disaster to lower earnings in the back half the year by up to 5 cents a share.   Still, 3M raised the lower end of its 2011 profit forecast by 5 cents a share to a range of $6.32 to $6.47, excluding pension and other costs.   Because many of 3M’s products are low-cost, quickly used and sold all over the world, the company is a barometer of global industrial health amid a European debt crisis, China’s efforts to tame inflation, and stagnant economic growth in the United States.   Growth in Europe was actually the strongest in the quarter, followed by Latin America and Canada, Asia-Pacific, all up at double-digit percentage rates. U.S. sales grew a more modest 8.7 percent.   3M gets more than 30 percent of its sales from fast-growing emerging markets.  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, editing by Gerald E.

23,UTX,"US suspends F-35 ground, air tests after device failure"," * Follows failure of an F-35’s integrated power package   * Program is U.S.’s costliest arms purchase   * Eight other countries involved in F-35’s development   By Jim Wolf   WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department suspended fleetwide ground and flight test operations on Wednesday of Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, its costliest arms purchase and largest international cooperative program. .   The department acted after the failure on Tuesday of one aircraft’s “integrated power package”, a turbo-machine that starts the engine and cools the plane, the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office said.   The office said in a statement that the suspension was a precautionary measure until experts understand the root causes of the failure aboard an F-35 conventional takeoff and landing variant at Edwards Air Force Base, California.   There are three F-35 models, or variants: A conventional takeoff-and-landing type for the Air Force; a short takeoff-vertical landing model for the Marine Corps and a carrier takeoff-and-landing variant for the Navy.   “Once the facts are understood, a determination will be made when to lift the suspension and begin ground and flight operations of the 20 F-35s currently in flying status,” the statement said.   These aircraft are part of the system development and demonstration and low-rate initial production fleet.   The United States is developing the family of radar-evading F-35s with eight international partners — Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway.   It is currently projected to cost the United States more than $382 billion to buy a total of 2,443 F-35 models over the next two decades. Other countries, including the co-development partners, are expected to buy roughly another 750 aircraft.   The F-35 is projected by Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier by sales, to account for more than 20 percent of its revenues once the Pentagon starts full production runs, likely in another few years.   The program had built enough “margin” into the test schedule to accommodate “these kinds of incidents that occur in a development effort,” the Pentagon statement said.   Periodic updates on the matter will be released as warranted, it said.   Lockheed Martin is supporting the review efforts 100 percent, said Michael Rein, a company spokesman.   “We are working very hard with all involved to resolve this issue so we can begin flight operations again which is everyone’s goal,” he said.   F-35 competitors for international sales include Boeing Co’s (BA.N) F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Saab’s Gripen, Dassault’s Rafale, Russia’s MiG-35 and Sukhoi Su-35 and the Eurofighter Typhoon made by a consortium of British, German, Italian and Spanish companies.   Lockheed’s chief F-35 subcontractors are Northrop Grumman Corp [NOC.N] and BAE Systems Plc  (BAES.L). United Technologies Corp’s  (UTX.N) Pratt & Whitney unit is building the engine.

24,UTX,BrightSource to offer solar-plant energy storage," * BrightSource using molten salt storage in power plants   * Can adjust amount of storage depending on customer needs   * CEO would not comment on timing of IPO   By Nichola Groom   LOS ANGELES, Aug 3 (Reuters) - BrightSource Energy Inc on Tuesday said it was now able to store the energy its solar thermal power plants produce, allowing them to function during after the sun sets.   The company, which filed with U.S. securities regulators for an initial public offering earlier this year, said it is combining its power tower solar thermal technology with molten salt storage.   Oakland, California-based BrightSource is calling the new offering, which it is aiming at utilities, SolarPLUS. It said the technology should help reduce the cost of solar power because the plant is able to produce more energy than it would without the storage component.   “A standard (photovoltaic solar) plant might do 1,900 hours per year, and with roughly six hours of storage we’ll do two-and-a-half times that,” BrightSource Chief Executive John Woolard said in an interview. “If I can deliver two-and-a-half times the amount of power from the same capacity asset, I’ve got a huge cost advantage on a per kilowatt hour basis.”   BrightSource’s storage offering can be adjusted depending on the needs of the customer, Woolard said. For instance, some utilities want six hours of storage that can generate power late into the evening, while others may only need two to three hours of storage. Currently, he said utilities must rely on fossil fuel plants to guarantee reliable power during those hours.   “(Utilities) take an intermittent asset, PV or wind, and then they have to back it up with separate natural gas and fossil plants to produce reliable power at low cost to ratepayers,” Woolard said. “We’re able to do all of that in one offering.”   Energy storage is considered critical to widespread adoption of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power because the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow.   Storage is also needed to balance supply on transmission networks due to the inherent volatility of renewable power.   Molten salt storage technology is widely used in Spain, according to BrightSource. Another California company, SolarReserve, licenses molten salt storage technology from United Technologies Corp (UTX.N).   BrightSource said its “solar salts” are made of sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate.   Woolard would not comment on when the company’s shares might begin trading.

25,UTX,Beaten-down Wall Street slammed by recession fears,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rising fears of another recession hammered U.S. stocks on Thursday, sending major averages sharply lower in a return to the extreme fluctuations investors endured a week ago.  New worries about the health of European banks set the tone before the market’s open, and a dismal report on regional U.S. manufacturing fueled a downward spiral in which the Dow dropped as much as 528 points, spurring a flight to safe-haven assets like gold.  The Nasdaq ended more than 5 percent lower, the S&P 500 more than 4 percent and the blue-chip Dow off more than 3 percent. Thursday marks the sixth time in the last two weeks that the S&P has moved by 4 percent or more.  “Are we going to go into recession? Most market participants were looking for slow and steady growth, but the statistics and the financial situation here and in foreign economies have disturbed that view,” said Richard Weiss, a Mountain View, California-based senior money manager at American Century Investments.  The Dow Jones industrial average fell 419.63 points, or 3.68 percent, to 10,990.58, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 53.24 points, or 4.46 percent, to 1,140.65, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 131.05 points, or 5.22 percent, to 2,380.43.  The losses resumed a slide in stocks that began in late July and seemed to moderate in the last few days. In a more worrisome sign, volume was heavier than on recent positive days, with 11.4 billion shares changing hands, highest so far this week.  “It almost feels as though the floor in its entirety is clearly engaged in executions but the overall theme is resignation,” said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City, New Jersey.  Kenny said that traders are increasingly resigned to the idea that the market trend is downward.  “What can you do about a trend that seems to be well established? It’s the new — I hate to say it — it is the new normal,” he said.  Volatility jumped, with the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX, a barometer of Wall Street anxiety, up 38 percent at 43.56. More investors were taking out protective positions against declines in the market.  The S&P 500 is now off 16.4 percent from its April 29 closing high, but the benchmark index still ended above its slump on August 9, when it fell to 1,101.54.  Adding to fears of a another recession, a survey of U.S. Mid-Atlantic factory activity by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank showed a drop in August to its lowest level since March 2009.  Even though European bank worries were at the forefront of investors’ minds, financials were not the worst-off stocks on Thursday.  The losses were spread throughout the market, with the biggest hits taken by growth-oriented sectors that speaks more to rising global economic concerns.

28,UTX,UPDATE 2-Lockheed F-35 test jets cleared to fly again,"   * Permanent fix still needed for a subsystem failure   * $382 bln program would be costliest US arms purchase   * Early production models remain grounded  (Adds Honeywell’s role, Lockheed comment, background)   By Jim Wolf   WASHINGTON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 test fighter aircraft have been cleared for flight after a precautionary grounding, but early production models remain parked until a permanent fix is found to a subsystem failure, the Pentagon’s program office said Thursday.   The United States is developing three models of radar-evading F-35s with eight international partners — Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway.   It would be the Pentagon’s costliest arms purchase at more than $382 billion over the coming two decades for more than 2,440 aircraft.   An Air Force Safety Investigation Board continues to review the failure of an “Integrated Power Package” aboard an F-35A assigned to Edwards Air Force Base, California, on Aug. 2, the office said in a statement. The subsystem is built by Honeywell Aerospace, a unit of Honeywell International. (HON.N)   The investigation indicates that a valve did not function properly, the F-35 program office said. The integrated power package provides power to start the engine and generates cooling for the aircraft. A Honeywell representative said he was trying to obtain more information on the valve in question.    Lockheed Martin is pleased with “the progress we have made in resolving the IPP issue and we are scheduled to begin flying today to continue our flight test program,” Michael Rein, a spokesman for the company’s F-35 program, said by email.   The program office said monitoring of the valve position “is a mitigating action to allow monitored operations” for the developmental test aircraft — but not the two early-production planes now parked at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, whose flights would be unmonitored.   The production aircraft will not return to air or ground operations “until there’s a permanent resolution to the valve issue in place,” said Joseph DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program office.   A total of 20 F-35s were grounded under the suspension of operations announced on Aug. 3, including the test planes and the early-production aircraft.   Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier by sales, expects the F-35 to account for more than 20 percent of revenue once the Pentagon starts full production runs, likely in another few years.   The impact of the latest F-35 grounding, the second this year, on test flight execution and production operations continues to be assessed, DellaVedova said in the statement. In March, the test planes were grounded after a dual electrical power generator failed in flight.   The program has built “margin into the test schedule to accommodate incidents that occur in the development effort,” the statement said.   F-35 competitors for international sales include Boeing Co’s (BA.N) F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Saab’s Gripen, Dassault’s Rafale, Russia’s MiG-35 and Sukhoi Su-35 and the Eurofighter Typhoon made by a consortium of British, German, Italian and Spanish companies.   Lockheed’s chief F-35 subcontractors are Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and BAE Systems (BAES.L) Plc. United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) Pratt & Whitney unit is building the engine.   There are three F-35 models, or variants: A conventional takeoff-and-landing type for the Air Force; a short takeoff-vertical landing model for the Marine Corps and a carrier takeoff-and-landing variant for the Navy.

30,UTX,Boeing 737 re-engine plan seen moving forward,"ATLANTA/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) will give an update Tuesday on its plans to revamp its best-selling 737 aircraft in a bid to fight off challenges from European rival Airbus, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  The U.S. planemaker is set to end weeks of uncertainty for investors, airlines and suppliers over the characteristics of the jet, after securing backing from its board to market a more efficient version equipped with new engines.  Boeing opted for the quick-fix “re-engining” plan, setting aside for now a longer-term redesign, after seeing Airbus EAD.PA grab the largest share of a record order in July from American Airlines AMR.N — once an exclusive Boeing customer.  The 737 and A320 compete in the market for jets with around 150 seats, the biggest segment of the global jetliner market and estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.  “The 737 is the best-selling airplane ever,” said Neal Dihora, a Morningstar analyst. “The neo (A320) came out with 1,000 order commitments within the first seven months, and I think the Boeing decision to re-engine is essentially to stem that tide from market-share losses,” he added.  Boeing and its engine maker CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (GE.N) and France’s Safran (SAF.PA), have been looking at installing an engine that would provide fuel savings of up to 10 percent compared with the current model, according to aerospace industry sources.  This compares with an advertised gain of 12 to 13 percent on the new engine for the A320neo, which Airbus says would save 15 percent compared to that model’s basic version when including the benefits of fuel-saving wingtips.  The gap would be offset by the smaller weight of the 737, which also carries 12 more passengers than the A320, producing lower proportionate costs for each seat on each trip.  CFM has an exclusive agreement to supply engines for the 737 and competes with United Technologies (UTX.N) unit Pratt & Whitney to provide the new engines for the A320.  Boeing is seen likely to avoid the same CFM engine Airbus chose for the A320neo because it would require costly changes to the landing gear and other parts of the structure.  Originally conceived in the 1960s, the 737 sits lower to the ground than the A320, which is convenient for baggage handling but leaves less room for a bigger engine.  In modern commercial jet engines, the majority of the thrust comes from fan-driven air that bypasses the hottest part of the engine where fuel is burned.  The amount of thrust is therefore tied closely to the fan size.  The cover of the existing engine already has to be flattened to fit it under the wing, giving it a distinctive squashed look on recent models.  The name of the revamped aircraft has not yet been announced but a supplier speculated recently that it could be called the “New Evolution.” The current version of the aircraft, introduced in the 1990s, is called the 737NG for Next Generation.  A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.  Boeing shares rose 2.9 percent to $64.60 on Monday, a day of broad gains for stocks.

32,UTX,Boeing plans to deliver re-engined 737 in 2017,"ATLANTA/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N), moving to counter a competitive offering from rival Airbus, said it will roll out a more efficient version of its best-selling 737 narrowbody with a new engine in 2017.  Boeing cited order commitments for 496 of the new planes from five airlines.  The new model, named the 737 MAX, will compete with the revamped A320neo family from Europe’s Airbus EAD.PA, a similar model due to be equipped with fuel-saving engines and delivered in 2015.  The Boeing jet will have engines from CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co (GE.N) and France’s Safran (SAF.PA). The board approved the re-engine plan, Boeing said on Tuesday.  Chicago-based Boeing said the 737 MAX is expected to have 16 percent lower fuel burn than the current offering from Airbus, 4 percent lower fuel burn than the Airbus A320neo, and lower overall operating costs.  “We believe very strongly that this is an airplane that’s going to allow us not to just maintain the market share that we have but one that’s going to allow us to grow the market share,” Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Jim Albaugh told a media briefing.  The 737 and A320 compete in the market for jets with around 150 seats, the biggest segment of the global jetliner market and estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.  Shares of Boeing were up 2.6 percent, or $1.65, to $66.25 in afternoon trading.  “We see the new engined version of the 737 as putting Boeing back on competitive footing with Airbus in the narrowbody market,” Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Richard Tortoriello wrote.  CFM said the specifications of the engine that would be used exclusively on the plane were still being fine-tuned with Boeing.  “The two companies are now working to define the final LEAP-1B engine configuration,” CFM said in a statement.  CFM International’s new LEAP generation of engines has a monopoly on the 737 and competes with Geared Turbofan engines from United Technologies (UTX.N) unit Pratt & Whitney on the Airbus A320.  High oil prices are spurring airlines to seek fuel-saving airplanes, re-charging the market battle between Boeing and Airbus with billions in orders at stake.  Boeing opted for the quick-fix “re-engining” plan, shelving a longer-term redesign of the popular single-aisle 737, when AMR Corp AMR.N unit American Airlines — which had been an exclusive Boeing customer — ordered 260 Airbus aircraft in July, including 130 A320neos.  The U.S. company sold 100 737s to AMR and won provisional commitments for a further 100 with new engines pending the Boeing board’s decision.  Boeing, which last week received U.S. approval to enter its 787 Dreamliner into commercial passenger service, cited “overwhelming demand” for the 737 MAX and said it would likely carry a price premium to the current 737 NG (Next Generation) version. Many airlines that have committed to the new narrowbody are outside the United States, it added.  Airbus sales chief John Leahy said the new Boeing offering would not outperform the A320neo in the air or in the market.  “Once again, Boeing is in denial,” Leahy told Reuters. “The re-engined 737 cannot possibly match the fuel efficiency and maintenance cost savings of the A320neo family. We’ll see the real world results in our order books.”  Airbus has racked up a thousand orders for the re-engined A320neo, which promises 12 to 15 percent fuel savings.  Aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of Virginia-based Teal Group said the availability of two engines on the A320neo could give the European plane the edge as Boeing avoids costly further improvements to the aircraft.  Boeing’s ability to put bigger engines on the 737 is limited by the narrow space between the wings and the ground, meaning a costlier overhaul would have been necessary to employ the full thrust available in the latest generation of engines.  “They’re seeking to hold on to an equal position in the narrowbody market with a minimal expenditure of company resources,” Aboulafia said.  Boeing said Bob Feldmann, who worked in its defense division, would be general manager of the 737 MAX family.

36,UTX,F-35 called part of U.S. security infrastructure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin’s (LMT.N) multinational F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon’s costliest weapons program, is a critical part of U.S. security infrastructure and should be funded solidly despite tight budgets, the company’s chief executive said on Tuesday.  The radar-evading aircraft is facing greater scrutiny in the U.S. Congress as lawmakers look for ways to pare the nation’s $1.4 trillion budget deficit and $14.3 trillion debt.  “An investment in the F-35 is a fundamental investment in the security infrastructure and architecture of the nation that will yield returns for the next 40 or 50 years,” Lockheed CEO Robert Stevens told the Reuters Aerospace & Defense Summit.  “Let’s follow through on this program,” he said. “Let’s not underinvest in it now and let’s get these airplanes delivered to the field where they can make a difference.”  Stevens said the plane’s flight testing was ahead of schedule this year. At the end of August it was 8 percent ahead on flights and about 11 percent ahead on the number of test benchmarks it had completed, Stevens said.  The aircraft is currently in low-level initial production but is expected to ramp up to full production runs by 2015 or 2016 once it gets the go-ahead from the U.S. government.  “The supply chain is maturing,” Stevens said. “We’re seeing greater cycling of the line. We’d like to see the momentum continue to build as we converge on that full-rate production decision.”  The Pentagon views the F-35’s radar-evading design as necessary to counter the increasing sophistication of air defenses designed to prevent the kind of aerial dominance the United States has maintained over the past 20 years.  The Defense Department is currently planning to purchase 2,443 of the aircraft through 2035, at a total cost of some $385 billion. It has been developed with eight foreign partners to replace at least 13 types of aircraft for 11 nations initially.  Stevens said Lockheed expects to sell about 750 aircraft to the consortium partners involved in the plane’s development.  The F-35 could account for more than 20 percent of Lockheed’s overall revenues, depending on overseas sales and the speed of U.S. acquisitions, once full production starts.  United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) unit Pratt & Whitney, the maker of the F-35’s engine, estimated that revenues from the aircraft would be $1 billion annually, or about a third of all revenues from its defense engine business, Pratt’s chief executive David Hess told the Reuters summit.  Stevens expressed optimism about the future of the F-35 program, likening it to the company’s F-16 fighter jet.  “We look at the F-16 program that’s delivered 4,400 airplanes in 25 countries,” he said. “The F-16 is just one of the airplanes that the F-35 will replace. The long-term future of the program has real promise. That promise could well take revenue generation in excess of 20 percent.”  The F-35 has come under fire for production delays and rising costs. Former defense secretary Robert Gates last year put the Marine Corps’ short-takeoff version of the plane on probation, threatening to cancel it unless its production problems are resolved.

37,UTX,"Pratt CEO warns Boeing on 737, keeps guidance","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) may be forced to cut short the lifespan of its just-launched 737 MAX aircraft and go back to the drawing board for a new airplane to protect sales, the head of engine maker Pratt & Whitney said on Tuesday.  The warning flies in the face of a recent decision by Boeing to match European rival Airbus by putting new engines on its 737 jets to help airlines quickly lower fuel costs, rather than investing more money and time in a completely fresh design.  Industry analysts say the decisions by Airbus and Boeing have defined the biggest segment of the airplane market for the next 15 years — but Pratt & Whitney believes Boeing may not be able to wait that long because the engine it has chosen is too small.  “Time will tell. Boeing responded to pressure ... and if they feel they don’t have a competitive airplane against the (Airbus) A320neo, they may be forced to accelerate or look at their plans for a (new plane),” Pratt & Whitney Chief Executive David Hess said.  Pratt & Whitney competes with CFM, a joint venture of General Electric (GE.N) and France’s Safran (SAF.PA), to supply engines for the revamped Airbus EAD.PA A320neo. CFM has an exclusive deal for the 737 and its upgraded successor, the 737 MAX.  Hess said he was skeptical about Boeing’s decision on the 737 MAX because the fan of CFM’s LEAP-X engine would be 66-68 inches, compared with 81 inches on Pratt’s engine for the A320neo, called the Geared Turbofan. The size of the fan affects thrust and efficiency.  “I would be surprised if it is 15 years before (Boeing) launch a ... new narrowbody airplane,” Hess told the annual Reuters Aerospace & Defense Summit.  Boeing said it stood by its decision to re-engine the 737, which followed a lengthy study of another more radical option.  Hess gave figures indicating Pratt & Whitney had sold some 400 Geared Turbofan engines since the eve of the Paris Air Show in June, when it announced cumulative orders and options for 1,200 engines for the A320neo and new market challengers.  Hess said on Tuesday that Pratt, a unit of United Technolgies Corp (UTX.N), has now sold 1,600 of those engines, including options.  He expects Pratt would grab a market share of more than 50 percent against CFM on the A320neo.

38,UTX,UTX says Rocketdyne unit draws buyer interest,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) has received potential buyer interest for its rocket engine business, Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, and is considering a range of strategic options including a sale of the business, a senior executive said on Tuesday.  David Hess, president of Pratt & Whitney — a United Technologies subsidiary — told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington that the end of the U.S. space shuttle program this summer has hurt the growth outlook for Rocketdyne — the world’s largest manufacturer of liquid-fueled rocket propulsion systems.  While the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is looking to develop new spacecraft capable of missions, policymakers are in continuing disputes over the design of follow-on civilian rockets for manned exploration.  “There is certainly uncertainty and certainly with the shuttle program ending it has had an impact on our business,” Hess said at the Reuters Summit.  “When there’s uncertainty, we have to look at the strategies for the business and we are looking at all kinds of strategic options for Rocketdyne, consolidation could be one of them,” he said.  Hess said that the company has received expressions of interest for Rocketdyne from potential buyers, while declining to elaborate on the interested parties.  “There are always inquirers, certainly it’s a very attractive company. Some of that technology has very interesting applications to the renewable energy segment,” Hess said.  “For all the reasons we found Rocketdyne business an interesting property, I think others view it to be attractive as well,” he said. United Technologies acquired Rocketdyne from Boeing Co (BA.N) in 2005 for about $700 million in cash.  People familiar with the industry have told Reuters that Alliant Techsystems Inc ATK.N and Gencorp Inc GY.N would be among the most logical buyers for Rocketdyne. While the U.S. space industry needs consolidation in order to survive in an increasingly tough growth environment, it remains unclear if any buyer would choose to pay up for assets in a declining industry, these people said.  Hess said that United Technologies is in no rush to make any decisions regarding Rocketdyne and it will take the necessary time to review a broad array of strategic alternatives.  “There’s no sense of urgency. The business is not collapsing,” Hess said.  “But this is not a crisis or fire sale, therefore we don’t feel any great sense of urgency to set some timetable for taking some action with it,” he said.

39,UTX,"Pratt CEO warns Boeing on 737, keeps guidance","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) may be forced to cut short the lifespan of its just-launched 737 MAX aircraft and go back to the drawing board for a new airplane to protect sales, the head of engine maker Pratt & Whitney said on Tuesday.  The warning flies in the face of a recent decision by Boeing to match European rival Airbus by putting new engines on its 737 jets to help airlines quickly lower fuel costs, rather than investing more money and time in a completely fresh design.  Industry analysts say the decisions by Airbus and Boeing have defined the biggest segment of the airplane market for the next 15 years — but Pratt & Whitney believes Boeing may not be able to wait that long because the engine it has chosen is too small.  “Time will tell. Boeing responded to pressure ... and if they feel they don’t have a competitive airplane against the (Airbus) A320neo, they may be forced to accelerate or look at their plans for a (new plane),” Pratt & Whitney Chief Executive David Hess said.  Pratt & Whitney competes with CFM, a joint venture of General Electric (GE.N) and France’s Safran (SAF.PA), to supply engines for the revamped Airbus EAD.PA A320neo. CFM has an exclusive deal for the 737 and its upgraded successor, the 737 MAX.  Hess said he was skeptical about Boeing’s decision on the 737 MAX because the fan of CFM’s LEAP-X engine would be 66-68 inches, compared with 81 inches on Pratt’s engine for the A320neo, called the Geared Turbofan. The size of the fan affects thrust and efficiency.  “I would be surprised if it is 15 years before (Boeing) launch a ... new narrowbody airplane,” Hess told the annual Reuters Aerospace & Defense Summit.  Boeing said it stood by its decision to re-engine the 737, which followed a lengthy study of another more radical option.  Hess gave figures indicating Pratt & Whitney had sold some 400 Geared Turbofan engines since the eve of the Paris Air Show in June, when it announced cumulative orders and options for 1,200 engines for the A320neo and new market challengers.  Hess said on Tuesday that Pratt, a unit of United Technolgies Corp (UTX.N), has now sold 1,600 of those engines, including options.  He expects Pratt would grab a market share of more than 50 percent against CFM on the A320neo.  Hess said revenue growth for engine spares would dip in the second half of 2011 but reaffirmed the company’s forecast for “low-double-digit” growth in aftermarket revenues for the year.  “The first two quarters were quite strong but against very easy comparisons last year. The growth rates will be lower in the back half of the year, but in total we think that we are still on low-double-digit growth for the year,” he said.

40,UTX,U.S. defense firms face relentless cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. defense industries are facing relentless, sophisticated foreign attacks on their computer networks, a threat company leaders say poses a risk of significant damage and may require the government to take greater protective action.  Top U.S. defense contractors speaking at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit said many of the attacks appeared to be state-sponsored and came from multiple countries, but they declined to point a finger at any particular government.  “Every defense company is constantly under attack. If anybody tells you they’re not, it just means they don’t know,” said Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) Chief Executive Wes Bush. “It is a threat that is broad-based. It’s not just from one source ... and it’s just unceasing.”  David Hess, the president of engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), said he suspected the attacks against his firm’s network were coming from “foreign countries” but “none that I’d like to mention.”  “I can say the attacks are sophisticated,” he added. “It’s not the result of some guy with sneakers in his cubicle hacking away at a computer screen.”  Linda Hudson, president of BAE Systems Inc (BAES.L), said attacks were “a very real daily threat to what we do and something we spend a lot of our own money on.”  The U.S. government has become increasingly concerned about security in cyberspace. Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn said in July that a foreign intelligence service stole 24,000 files from a U.S. defense contractor earlier this year.  He revealed the theft as he unveiled a new Pentagon cybersecurity strategy that calls for cyberspace to be treated as an “operational domain” like air, land or sea where U.S. forces will practice and prepare to defend against attack.  Lynn said a recent estimate pegged economic losses from the theft of intellectual property and information from government and commercial computers at more than $1 trillion.  Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) Chief Executive Robert Stevens, whose company thwarted a serious cyberattack in late May, said incursions faced by defense industries are “very persistent.”  “They’re very frequent and they have varying levels of sophistication, but the sophistication seems to be getting greater,” he said. “The agility seems to be getting more adaptable, and the challenges are genuinely growing.”  To explore ways to cope with the problem, the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security launched the Defense Industrial Base Cyber Pilot, a program for sharing classified and sensitive data about cyberattacks.  Lynn said in August the program, which initially involved about 20 volunteer companies, had already stopped hundreds of attempted intrusions and would be expanded in the coming months to the rest of the defense industrial base, as well as to companies involved in critical infrastructure.  Northrop’s Bush, whose company is one of several defense contractors involved in cybersecurity as a business, said he thought the Defense Department had been “very aggressively” addressing the issue of network security, making “a lot of good progress.”  “But on a broader national level, I think where we’re eventually going to need to end up, and this is something you often don’t hear from industry, but I think we probably need a little bit more of a regulatory perspective brought to this,” he said.  Bush said critical infrastructure industries, such as energy, are not set up like defense companies to deal with the threat of cyberattacks. And they are waiting on the sidelines, knowing they need to take action but not wanting to invest in security several times before getting the right solution, he said.  “How does the federal government help those, particularly the critical infrastructure industries, know that they’re doing the right things,” he questioned.  “No single company can solve this problem by themselves. So it’s a case, a natural opportunity, for the federal government to have a role in creating policies and approaches to help secure the cyber domain that we all depend on,” Bush said.  BAE Systems’ Hudson, whose company also offers cybersecurity services, said she didn’t see the need for regulation of top-tier defense contractors, which are already deeply involved in protecting their networks.  For small contractors or critical infrastructure, she said, “there’s been a lot of talk about requiring a certain level of support and security protection that in fact would generate a market for some of us who have those capabilities.”  ",9072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aero-arms-summit-cybersecurity/u-s-defense-firms-face-relentless-cyberattacks-idUSTRE7867F120110907
41,UTX,BAE sees no bold deals near term: U.S. CEO,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L) is looking at acquisitions but is being very cautious at a time when the industry grapples with the prospect of sharp cuts in military spending, the head of the company’s U.S. operations said on Wednesday.  Linda Hudson, chief executive of BAE Systems Inc, said at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit that the defense contractor is in an “acquisition mode” and looking at many targets for possible takeover, but it is cautious about not overpaying for assets in a market with uncertain outlook.  “We see a lot of target properties and some of the more interesting ones have extraordinary valuations. Coming up with a business case that makes sense is very very difficult in that regard, particularly with all the uncertainty we see right now from a budget perspective,” Hudson told the Reuters summit.  “We are still looking at lots and lots of properties but we are being more cautious, making sure the financial case is a little bit more compelling,” she said.  “I view right now is not the time to do something kind of bold and outrageous. It’s a time to be thoughtful and careful and deliberate about acquisitions.”  Global weapons makers are bracing for cuts in defense spending sparked partly by this summer’s U.S. debt-ceiling deal. The U.S. Defense Department is cutting at least $350 billion from previously projected spending, and additional cuts of as much as $600 billion could kick in if Congress fails to find at least $1.2 trillion more in deficit reductions by year end.

42,UTX,More cuts would hurt defense sector: Pentagon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The defense industry would face devastating consequences if Congress fails to find a solution for reducing U.S. budget deficits by the end of the year, the Pentagon’s industrial policy chief said.  The Defense Department is already cutting at least $350 billion from previously projected spending, and additional cuts of as much as $600 billion could kick in if Congress fails to find at least $1.2 trillion more in deficit reductions by year-end.  While the Defense Department is working to meet the initially proposed cuts, any additional reduction would mean big uncertainty for the already struggling industry, Brett Lambert, deputy assistant secretary of defense, manufacturing and industrial base policy, said at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington on Tuesday.  “The only certainty of that uncertainty is that it would be devastating to the department and to the industry if implemented as currently envisioned,” Lambert said.  “What has made (the defense industry) less attractive in the last few years is the uncertainty, not the fundamentals,” he said.  Global weapons makers are bracing for cuts in defense spending, sparked partly by this summer’s U.S. debt-ceiling deal, as well as planned U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan.  Lambert expects the challenges facing the industry to spur more mergers and acquisitions in coming years as companies look to cut costs and improve efficiency. But he said consolidation among prime defense contractors has largely run its course.  “Knowing that the industry will go through this period of transformation — we believe there is going to be more activity in mergers and acquisitions and spin-outs — my office is preparing to deal with more activity over the coming years,” Lambert said. “We think that’s healthy, that’s natural and we expect it to be robust.”  But the Defense Department believes the current number of prime defense contractors is adequate to ensure a viable supply chain.  “We feel comfortable with the current number of primes we have. We’re not precluding or we’re not ruling anything out, but we are comfortable with the level of that number, we think that number serves the department well,” Lambert said.

43,UTX,"Boeing engine too small, says Pratt","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney warned Boeing on Tuesday it may have to rethink its strategy for competing with Airbus in a $2 trillion segment of the jet market because the engine it has chosen from rival GE (GE.N) is too small.  Matching plans by Airbus EAD.PA to upgrade its A320 with new engines, Boeing (BA.N) has come up with plans to revamp its best-selling 737 medium-haul jet with new engines from CFM, a joint venture between GE and France’s Safran (SAF.PA).  By doing so, it has put on the back burner alternative proposals to invest more time and money in an all-new airplane.  Analysts say the decisions have defined until 2025 a portion of the market valued at $2 trillion over 20 years. But Pratt & Whitney, a leader in combat engines and which once dominated civil markets, believes Boeing may not be able to wait that long.  “Time will tell. Boeing responded to pressure ... and if they feel they don’t have a competitive airplane against the A320neo they may be forced to accelerate or look at their plans for a (new plane),” Pratt & Whitney Chief Executive David Hess said.  “I would be surprised if it is 15 years before (Boeing) launch a ... new narrowbody airplane,” Hess told the annual Reuters Aerospace & Defense Summit.  Pratt & Whitney competes with CFM to supply engines for the revamped Airbus A320neo. CFM has an exclusive deal for the 737 and its upgraded successor 737 MAX.  United Technologies (UTX.N) unit Pratt & Whitney has an interest in questioning the longevity of Boeing’s latest project, since it can only enter the 737 market once Boeing switches to a radically new model due to an exclusivity agreement between Boeing and CFM for the existing model.  Hess’s comments will expand an already fierce debate about whether it is better to stick with the proven concepts such as CFM engines or back new engine architecture offered by Pratt’s latest generation of engines, known as Geared Turbofan.  Billions of dollars in engine sales and long-term repair contracts are at stake in the rival boasts of engineers.  A main reason for Hess’s skepticism relates to engine size.  CFM engines on existing Boeings have a flat-bottomed casing to help them fit under the wing, which is lower to the ground than that of the A320. This gives the engines the distinctive squashed look visible to passengers, but limits the scope for souping up the engine without costly changes to the airframe.  Boeing and CFM plan to increase the fan size slightly to 66 or 68 inches, yet the A320 engine’s fan will be up to 81 inches. The size of the fan affects thrust and efficiency, but the bigger the fan the more weight the aircraft also has to carry, so engine-makers and plane-makers have to find the best compromise.  “Boeing has made it clear it is going to be a minimum-change airplane and I don’t see them doing anything else for the airplane that is going to result in substantial fuel benefit, so it is going to have to come from the engine, and I will be happy to take the Geared Turbofan’s chances against a 66- or 68-inch Leap-X any day,” Hess said.  Boeing stood by its decision to re-engine the 737 and repeated it would be 7 percent more efficient than the A320neo.  “The 737 MAX delivers the big savings in fuel that airlines require for the future,” said spokesman Marc Birtel.  “With regard to future product development, we don’t see a new small airplane emerging until well into the next decade.”  CFM says its 737 engine variant is optimized for that plane.  Boeing and Airbus are locked in a battle to sell their revamped models, triggering a secondary competition between CFM and Pratt & Whitney to win engine deals for the A320neo.  Hess gave figures indicating Pratt & Whitney had sold some 400 geared turbofan engines since the eve of the Paris Air Show in June, when it announced cumulative orders and options for 1,200 engines for the A320neo and new market challengers.  The United Technologies unit has now sold 1,600 of those engines including options, Hess said on Tuesday.  He expected Pratt & Whitney would grab a market share of more than 50 percent against CFM on the A320neo.  Of the 1,300 twin-engined A320neo aircraft sold by Airbus, 500 had yet to see an engine selection, including 100 ordered by AMR AMR.N unit American Airlines. “We are certainly going after the AMR order,” Hess said.  Hess defended the Bombardier (BBDb.TO) CSeries, a challenger to the 737 and A320 that also carries the latest Pratt engines but whose sales have fallen short of expectations.  Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) looked at the CSeries before placing a recent order for 100 Boeing 737’s, but has decided to defer further airplane orders for 2-3 years, he said.  Hess said aviation demand remained robust despite alarm bells in the rest of the manufacturing sector as the economic recovery falters. U.S. airlines are replacing old fleets to save fuel while emerging markets have produced a surge in new demand.  Hess predicted revenue growth for engine spares would dip in the second half of 2011 but reaffirmed a forecast for “low double-digit” growth in aftermarket revenues for the whole year.

44,UTX,Foreign M&A; in U.S. defense sector under scrutiny,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are increasingly taking a tougher stand on foreign takeovers in the defense sector to protect technology designed to deal with the growing and unseen threats of the cyber age.  As security threats evolve from tanks and guns to the bits and bytes of cyber and communication networks, foreign suitors eyeing high-end U.S. security assets face deeper regulatory scrutiny, senior industry dealmakers said at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit this week.  Such a trend could undercut efforts by foreign companies such as EADS EAD.PA to expand further into the U.S. defense market, which is bracing for steep cutbacks in spending under a U.S. deficit review but which remains by far the world’s largest.  “I think as the threat changes, the regulatory regime is trying to adapt to focus on sensitivities in communications network, communications technologies, cybersecurity and some of the information-based technologies,” said Michael Urfirer, co-chairman and chief executive of investment bank Stone Key Partners.  Foreign takeovers affecting U.S. security are screened by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency panel set up in 1975 by then-president Gerald Ford.  A growing portion of deals are submitted to a more detailed investigation lasting 45 days, after an initial review of 30 days, and regulators may insist on putting the assets behind a firewall or “proxy board” with limited or no foreign oversight.  “Deals are being approved, but there is some concern over the time deals are taking,” said Nancy McLernon, president and chief executive of the Organization for International Investment (OFII), a lobby group for subsidiaries of foreign-based firms.  Some 38 percent of CFIUS cases proceeded to the second-stage investigation in 2009 and 2010. OFII says this is equivalent to the total number of investigations in the previous 20 years.  “They’ve migrated to erring on the side of conservatism,” said Greg Starkins, managing director at Deutsche Bank. “They’ve decided that if they’re going to make a wrong decision, to be wrong on the side of conservatism and not on leniency.”  The U.S. Treasury did not respond to a request for comment.  The more stringent regulatory environment is another complication for foreign buyers who already face an uphill battle when trying to acquire a U.S. security company. Some purchases require a proxy board structure designed to protect U.S. national security assets from foreign nationals.  “If a company believes they will need to have a proxy board over the operation, it is often enough to dissuade them from making the acquisition,” said Adam Palmer, who manages aerospace and defense investments for the Carlyle Group private equity firm.  “In proxy board structures, a lot of times no officers of a foreign entity have any idea what’s going on, and it’s very difficult to manage a business.”  That has not stopped foreign contractors from seeking greater exposure to the U.S. military market, which accounted for roughly half of global defense spending worth about $1.4 trillion before the latest downturn.  “The growth is going to be in the kinds of technical services that are highly sensitive,” said Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute think tank.  But foreign buyers would need to lower their expectations if they set their sights exclusively on U.S. targets dealing with more sophisticated modern threats, even though that is where the most value is.  “If they go into it with a willingness to try to come up with a workable solution, in most cases foreign buyers have been able to get to something they may not be ecstatic about but they get to something that’s at least viable,” Urfirer said.  “It doesn’t go so well if the attitude is ‘I want to buy this and that’s it.’”  ",9082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aero-arms-summit-foreigntakeovers/foreign-ma-in-u-s-defense-sector-under-scrutiny-idUSTRE78787720110908
45,UTX,GE exec: Military business future hangs on F-35,"BOSTON (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) believes its future in the large military jet engine business depends on the fight for its alternate engine for the multinational F-35 fighter jet.  The Pentagon has said it does not want the engine, but GE and its partner on the product, Britain’s Rolls-Royce Holding Plc (RR.L), want to continue developing it without government funding.  The companies hope a final government decision on the engine will be made by the first half of next year, Dale Carlson, GE’s executive for advanced engine systems, said at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington.  “It’s more than just the tactical aspect of selling the 136 (engine) for the F-35,” Carlson said. “Take the worst-case scenario, to say because of this lack of F-136 production for the F-35, we just scaled back significantly in our military engine offerings ... You’re going to take out half of the large military engine capability in this country. I think somebody should be thinking about what the implications for that are as we have new emerging players in the world.”  The Pentagon in April formally canceled the GE-Rolls engine, saying it was an unnecessary expense. It choose Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), as the sole supplier for the program.  GE, the largest U.S. conglomerate, continues to argue that having a choice of two suppliers would save money over the long term.  Carlson said he could not say how long Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE, which in the first half of 2011 generated 18 percent of its profit in commercial aviation, would continue to pursue the F-35 business.  “There’s people obviously in our company thinking about how long this goes on,” Carlson said. “We’re hoping for resolution here in the next six to eight months, and we’ll see.  Government investment in new technologies for military engines also eventually provides a boost for civilian flight, he added.  “A lot of these technologies go directly into the commercial products as well as the military products,” Carlson said.

47,UTX,FBI eyes possible corruption in aerospace,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. law enforcement officials are tracking possible bribery and corruption issues involving the global aerospace industry and foreign state-owned airlines, according to legal and government sources.  According to a document obtained by Reuters, the FBI briefed other government agencies in June about a project focused on possible corruption associated with sales and maintenance contracts between aerospace companies and state-owned airlines.  While the aerospace industry has long been subject to such scrutiny, the new initiative focuses on sales and maintenance contracts on the commercial side, not in defense.  Aerospace companies have been seeking guidance on anti-corruption issues in recent months, according to a consultant.  The FBI briefing was part of a broader overview by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of its stepped-up enforcement of U.S. anti-corruption laws — a move that has dramatically fueled corporate demand for compliance programs and attorneys specializing in anti-bribery practice.  It was not immediately clear what triggered the FBI’s fresh focus on aerospace, but legal experts said sectorwide investigations may stem from self-disclosure of problems at one specific company or reports from whistleblowers. A new U.S. law that took effect July 1 makes whistleblowers eligible for big cash rewards for tips about bribery or corruption.  Recent cases involving defense companies may have also spurred investigators to look at similar issues involving commercial aerospace deals, particularly given increased efforts by U.S. companies to offset declining domestic work with more deals in the Middle East and Asia, where corruption has been rampant.  Officials at the Justice Department, FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on ongoing investigations, but one former senior Justice Department official and one current law enforcement official confirmed that the aerospace industry was an area of perennial interest.  “The aerospace industry has always been something that’s been on the radar screen,” said the former senior official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.  In early 2010, Britain’s giant defense contractor BAE Systems (BAES.L) agreed to plead guilty to two criminal charges and pay more than $400 million in penalties to settle a long-running Justice Department investigation into big payments made to win huge contracts in Saudi Arabia and eastern Europe.  One management consultant who advises U.S. companies on compliance issues said big firms like BAE, Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) had extensive compliance and anti-corruption programs, but many second-tier companies could run into trouble when bidding for deals overseas.  Fresh attention to the aerospace industry comes amid sharp increases in enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by the FBI and the SEC.  Both agencies have adopted a more proactive approach that examines whole industries including the pharmaceutical sector, medical devices and even financial services, according to lawyers working on such issues.  The FBI’s decision to tell other agencies about its interest in aerospace means it may soon ask a range of companies to provide documents about their compliance programs for any possible violations, experts said.  Industry executives told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington this week that compliance with U.S. and international anti-bribery laws remains a big priority for an industry that has seen its share of violations over the years.  Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), said each of the company’s 126,000 employees, and every member of the company’s board of directors, received in-depth ethics training once a year.  “We can afford to lose a program ... we can’t afford to lose our reputation,” Stevens said, underscoring the long-lasting impact or “half-life of an ethical violation.”  “We make it clear ... (that) one employee can destroy for years the reputations of 100,000-plus employees,” he said.  The FCPA was enacted in 1977 partly because a Senate investigation showed that Lockheed had paid $22 million in bribes to members of friendly governments to guarantee contracts for military aircraft, including the F-104 Starfighter.  David Hess, chief executive of Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), said increased enforcement had reenergized his company’s long-standing ethics program.  Harry Clark, a partner with Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, said the U.S. government was clearly bringing more cases, and investigators were using aggressive techniques such undercover agents, wiretapping and long-term surveillance.  Complex computer models and forensic investigations of accounting records have also proven useful in finding evidence of corruption, often involving unusual payments to third parties, according to legal experts.

48,UTX,U.S. scrutinizes foreign defense M&A;,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are increasingly taking a tougher stand on foreign takeovers in the defense sector to protect technology designed to deal with the growing and unseen threats of the cyber age.  As security threats evolve from tanks and guns to the bits and bytes of cyber and communication networks, foreign suitors eyeing high-end U.S. security assets face deeper regulatory scrutiny, senior industry dealmakers said at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit this week.  Such a trend could undercut efforts by foreign companies such as EADS EAD.PA to expand further into the U.S. defense market, which is bracing for steep cutbacks in spending under a U.S. deficit review, but which remains by far the world’s largest.  “I think as the threat changes, the regulatory regime is trying to adapt to focus on sensitivities in communications network, communications technologies, cybersecurity and some of the information-based technologies,” said Michael Urfirer, co-chairman and chief executive of investment bank Stone Key Partners.  Foreign takeovers affecting U.S. security are screened by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency panel set up in 1975 by then-president Gerald Ford.  A growing portion of deals are submitted to a more detailed investigation lasting 45 days, after an initial review of 30 days, and regulators may insist on putting the assets behind a firewall or “proxy board” with limited or no foreign oversight.  “Deals are being approved, but there is some concern over the time deals are taking,” said Nancy McLernon, president and chief executive of the Organization for International Investment (OFII), a lobby group for subsidiaries of foreign-based firms.  Some 38 percent of CFIUS cases proceeded to the second-stage investigation in 2009 and 2010. OFII says this is equivalent to the total number of investigations in the previous 20 years.  “They’ve migrated to erring on the side of conservatism,” said Greg Starkins, managing director at Deutsche Bank. “They’ve decided that if they’re going to make a wrong decision, to be wrong on the side of conservatism and not on leniency.”  A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment.  The more stringent regulatory environment is another complication for foreign buyers who already face an uphill battle when trying to acquire a U.S. security company. Some purchases require a proxy board structure designed to protect U.S. national security assets from foreign nationals.  “If a company believes they will need to have a proxy board over the operation, it is often enough to dissuade them from making the acquisition,” said Adam Palmer, who manages aerospace and defense investments for the Carlyle Group private equity firm.  “In proxy board structures, a lot of times no officers of a foreign entity have any idea what’s going on, and it’s very difficult to manage a business.”  That has not stopped foreign contractors from seeking greater exposure to the U.S. military market, which accounted for roughly half of global defense spending worth about $1.4 trillion before the latest downturn.  “The growth is going to be in the kinds of technical services that are highly sensitive,” said Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute think-tank.  But foreign buyers would need to lower their expectations if they set their sights exclusively on U.S. targets dealing with more sophisticated modern threats, even though that is where the most value is.  “If they go into it with a willingness to try to come up with a workable solution, in most cases foreign buyers have been able to get to something they may not be ecstatic about, but they get to something that’s at least viable,” Urfirer said.  “It doesn’t go so well if the attitude is ‘I want to buy this and that’s it.’”  ",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aero-arms-summit-foreigntakeovers/u-s-scrutinizes-foreign-defense-ma-idUSTRE78787720110909
49,UTX,U.S. aerospace/defense stresses jobs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. military contractors are more than ever promoting the stimulative impact of their business on jobs and the economy as Congress mulls steeper cuts in defense spending to reduce the budget deficit.  With job creation a political priority amid 9.1 percent unemployment, defense industry executives are applying pressure with $330 billion in cuts already in the pipeline and billions more possible through the early part of the next decade.  Companies, their workers and their lobbying forces are placing stronger relevance in their outreach to lawmakers and the Obama administration on economic issues as big reductions are weighed in an uncertain fiscal climate in addition to always prominent national security arguments.  “I think they need to temper their thinking and their decisions with the benefits that industry has to the economy,” Pratt & Whitney Chief Executive David Hess told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit. Pratt & Whitney is a division of United Technologies (UTX.N).  More than 10 percent of U.S. manufacturing demand is supported by aerospace and defense spending, industry figures show. About 800,000 jobs are directly tied to the sector, which supports numerous other jobs.  Other leading companies in the sector include Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), Boeing (BA.N), Northrop Grumman (NOC.N), General Dynamics (GD.N).  Total industry sales of planes, missiles, ships, ground equipment and other technology topped $214 billion last year.  Additional business related to Energy Department, Homeland Security, and satellite programs add to the economic engine.  “Nobody in the government thinks about that impact systematically, and politicians often describe military outlays as if they are a drag on the economy rather than a stimulus,” Loren Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, wrote this week in a Forbes column.  “Political leaders can’t seem to grasp that money spent by the Pentagon is just as potent in creating jobs as money spent by the Department of Transportation,” Thompson said.  He told Reuters separately that President Barack Obama’s $300 billion proposal on Thursday night to create jobs throughout the economy with his reelection fortunes sagging comes as the government considers $300 billion or more in military spending reductions.  At the same time, Thompson told Reuters that companies and their allies historically have not made a coherent case about the economic impact of their business.  Industry is working overdrive to minimize spending cuts, which could lead to tens of thousands of lost civilian jobs, analysts said. These, in many cases, would include higher wage engineering and technology positions and specialized assembly jobs.  In an unusual alliance, the Aerospace Industries Association trade group joined last week with organized labor in a letter to Obama to tout the industry’s impact on jobs.  The September 1 letter urged Obama to “keep in mind the many thousands of aerospace and defense workers that face the loss of their jobs in these difficult economic times.”  The group plans to next circulate a similar letter to key members of Congress.

52,UTX,Contractors battle against further military cuts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense contractors launched a broad lobbying campaign on Wednesday to drum up public support for holding the line on U.S. military spending cuts.  Alarmed at the prospect of Congress dictating steep new reductions on top of more than $350 billion in cuts already in the pipeline from Pentagon streamlining, contractors based their urgent appeal on economic as well as national security grounds.  Industry lobbyists are highlighting the role of small business in aerospace production and asking the general public to contact lawmakers directly to support their position.  “Our position is: no more,” Marion Blakey, chief executive of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group, told a news conference on the stepped-up lobbying effort. “Defense has been cut to the bone. We are there already.”  Boeing Co; engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp; and other companies under the AIA umbrella are looking to create general awareness about the potential impact of extended spending reductions.  A congressional “super committee” on deficit reduction is trying to find at least $1.2 trillion in budget savings over the next decade.  The worst-case scenario coming out of the panel by year’s end — if it cannot reach agreement on additional cuts — would be an additional defense cut of up to $600 billion over the same period.  Industry calls this possibility “draconian.” Senior U.S. civilian military officials, including the nominee for the Pentagon’s No. 2 post, Defense Undersecretary Ashton Carter, told the Senate this week that cuts “over and above” the level already in the works would be devastating.  Beyond traditional lobbying that includes CEO visits to “super committee” members this week, the AIA trade group — which also represents Lockheed Martin Corp, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and others — is launching a grass-roots strategy.  In addition to national security, the contractors are drawing attention to the connections between the industry to the economy and small business, highlighting the impact on communities and working families.  The defense industry has taken its issues to the public before, but those efforts centered on decisions impacting specific regions. It has done little previously to promote its message on the national economy.  Blakey said defense companies will try to reach out to every member of Congress, and is encouraging the public to do the same.  The industry, according to figures compiled for AIA, directly employs more than a million people in the United States and affects nearly 2 million additional jobs.  Defense companies benefited enormously from a run-up in military spending over the past decade and face a tougher future. Some defense experts contend the Pentagon’s budget has become bloated and could absorb as much as $1 trillion in total budget cuts over the next 10 years. This includes the $350 billion already in the works.  But Blakey said aerospace companies were “fragile” and are now cutting jobs.  Jim Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing’s commercial aircraft division and AIA chairman, said potential job losses associated with the cuts under consideration could add about 1 percentage point to national unemployment over 10 years. The U.S. jobless rate is currently 9.1 percent.  The group met with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Wednesday, which the executives characterized as a productive discussion. Panetta underscored the importance of maintaining the skills and capabilities of the defense industrial base as well as continuing to invest in research and development, the companies and a Pentagon spokesman said.

Sikorsky employs some 18,000 people worldwide.   The company said it had offered buyouts to eligible unionized workers in Connecticut and did not yet have details on how many of the layoffs would come in the United States.   Stratford, Connecticut-based Sikorsky, which makes both civilian and Black Hawk military helicopters, faces weakening demand as Washington looks for ways to cut spending to deal with a large budget gap. Leaders in Congress last month agreed to $350 billion of cuts in national security spending over the next decade.   Stubbornly high unemployment, which hovers near 9 percent, stands as one of the biggest stumbling blocks for a struggling U.S. economy, which received more bad news on Thursday in a report that new claims for unemployment aid rose unexpectedly last week.

58,UTX,FACTBOX-Defense industry united as debt panel weighs cuts," Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. military contractors are united in their push to stem additional cuts in defense spending that could come out of a congressional “super committee” charged with finding ways to lower the deficit.   Boeing Co (BA.N); engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of UTX Corp (UTX.N); Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), General Dynamics (GD.N), Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) and others have launched a multi-pronged lobbying campaign that seeks to draw public support for their position.   Following are facts about current and possible defense cuts and the Pentagon and industry’s response. For a related story please click on [ID:nS1E78E0I4].   — The leading budget proposal in the Senate recommends roughly $630 billion in spending for the 2012 fiscal year beginning in October, freezing the Pentagon’s base budget at $513 billion and calling for $118 billion for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Defense Department awards $400 billion in contracts each year.   — House and Senate leaders agreed in August to $350 billion in cuts to national security spending over 10 years as part of its deficit-reduction package. The worst-case scenario coming out of the “super committee” by year’s end — if it cannot reach agreement on additional cuts — would be an additional cut of up to $600 billion over the same period.   — Top lobbyists for the military contractors say the industry is fragile, having cut thousands of jobs in the defense industry slowdown. But defense experts contend the Pentagon’s budget has become bloated over the past decade in a spending run-up and could absorb as much as $1 trillion in total budget cuts over the next 10 years. This includes the $350 billion already in the works.   — Chief executives of military contractors led by Boeing Co (BA.A) commercial aircraft CEO Jim Albaugh, who is also chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, have lobbied “super committee” members directly. The group has also launched a public lobbying campaign to highlight the economic impact of defense spending cuts on small business and jobs. AIA figures show the industry directly employs more than 1 million people in the United States and affects nearly 2 million other jobs. The AIA this week gave an award to Senator Patty Murray, a “super committee” member whose state is home to Boeing aircraft assembly operations.   — Defense company executives met on Tuesday with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Panetta underscored the importance of maintaining the skills and capabilities of the defense industrial base as well as continuing to invest in research and development, the companies and a Pentagon spokesman said. But Panetta also stressed the need to work together to find efficiencies in the current tight-budget climate.   — Senior U.S. civilian military officials, including the nominee for the Pentagon’s No. 2 post, Defense Undersecretary Ashton Carter, told the Senate this week that cuts “over and above” the level already in the works would be devastating. Carter said a failure by the “super committee” to reach an agreement on spending would be particularly bad because the ensuing cuts would hit everything equally.   — Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon’s costliest weapons program, is under close scrutiny for budget savings in Congress. The Senate Defense Appropriations subcommittee proposes to cut it by $695 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It also recommended termination of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Program, a possible replacement for Army and Marine Humvee vehicles. The panel rejected the Navy’s request for a Mobile Landing Platform vessel, saying it should be delayed for a year.

59,UTX,Bombardier C-Series sales target at risk: analyst,"(Reuters) - An uncertain global economy and a deep sense of caution among aircraft buyers may result in Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) missing sales targets for its new C-Series regional jet, an analyst said on Thursday.  Bombardier, the world’s third biggest commercial airplane maker, may not meet its target of selling 300 of the narrow-body, 110- to 135-seat aircraft by the time they enter service late in 2013, RBC Capital Markets analyst Walter Spracklin said.  “While we were encouraged by the interest the airlines demonstrated in the C-Series, there was certainly a lack of urgency to place significant new orders,” Spracklin said in a note to clients.  “Combine this with the emerging macro headwinds, we believe airlines are more inclined to delay their renewal programs,” he said after conducting a survey of 26 potential C-Series customers.  The 26 possible customers represent an estimated 35 percent of the 100- to 149-seater aircraft market in operation globally today, Spracklin said.  Bombardier’s stock shrugged off the report rising 20 Canadian cents, or 4.8 percent, to C$4.40 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday. The stock was recovering from a slump on Wednesday on news that Delta Air Lines <DAL.N, a potential major customer, was no longer in the market to buy more planes.  Meanwhile, Pratt & Whitney, the makers of an all-new turbofan engine for the C-Series, said the engine had “operated flawlessly” during its first flight test program, allowing tests scheduled for 2012 to be carried out early.  “Results confirmed our earlier sea level test findings validating the geared turbofan’s overall engine design,” said Bob Saia, vice-president of next generation product at Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N).  The C-Series is at the center of Montreal-based Bombardier’s ambitious $3 billion plan to build its biggest regional commercial aircraft yet, at a time when the market for smaller planes is shrinking. The fuel-efficient C-Series will compete with the smaller aircraft from industry giants Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus EAD.PA.  Despite promises that the C-Series’ operating costs will be 15 percent lower than those of similar aircraft, potential buyers are edgy about a new, untested plane that is different from their existing fleets, RBC analyst Spracklin said.  “Overwhelmingly, the costs and complexity associated with introducing a new aircraft type into their fleet was the number one hurdle facing their decision to purchase C-Series,” he said.  Orders for the C-Series, which now total 133, are likely to remain small, around the 10-aircraft level that has characterized existing orders, Spracklin said.  Bombardier’s stock is down 20 percent this year partly on concerns about C-Series sales.  Spracklin expects the stock price to remain range bound unless the macroeconomic environment improves, Bombardier is able to boost sales of its other regional jets or there is some positive demand or development news on the C-Series program.

61,UTX,Exclusive: United Tech seeks $10-20 billion for deal,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is lining up $10 billion to $20 billion in financing for a U.S. acquisition that could shape up as its biggest takeover in a decade, said people with direct knowledge of the matter.  Investors immediately bid up shares of smaller aerospace suppliers Goodrich Corp GR.N, Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) and Textron Inc (TXT.N) on Friday betting that the diversified U.S. manufacturer could buy one of them and kick-start a wave of consolidation in the aerospace and defense sector.  Goodrich, which is benefiting from rising demand for equipment for large commercial aircraft, makes the most strategic sense for United Tech, according to people familiar with the industry but not directly involved in the deal. Its chief executive, Marshall Larsen, is preparing to retire in the next couple of years.  Shares of Goodrich rose 7.4 percent on the NYSE, giving it a market value of $11.6 billion. The stock surged another 21 percent after-hours on increasing speculation that Goodrich is United Tech’s most likely target.  Rockwell Collins is also a good strategic fit for United Tech, industry insiders say, although compared to Goodrich, its revenue is more dependent on the defense sector, which faces budget cuts in the United States and Europe. Rockwell Collins shares closed up 7.8 percent on the NYSE to give it a market value of $8.6 billion.  Mergers could help the aerospace industry cut costs and boost capacity to meet booming demand from aircraft manufacturers.  A mid-tier aerospace company joining the United Tech group would gain access to more work, said Jim McAleese, a Washington-based defense consultant.  “It would also expand United Technologies’ footprint into the premium commercial aerospace portfolios, beyond their current work in engines through Pratt & Whitney,” he said.  United Tech, which has a market value of about $68 billion, is still working on terms of an offer and any potential bid could still fall apart, said the people with direct knowledge of the situation. They asked not to be identified as the plans are confidential.  Officials at United Tech, which makes products ranging from helicopters to air conditioners, declined to comment, as did those at Goodrich, Rockwell Collins and Textron.  A deal of this scale would be United Tech’s largest takeover attempt since its unsuccessful bid for Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) in 2000. Since then, its largest acquisitions have been in the $1 billion to $3 billion range as it built up its fire and security division.  United Tech shareholders took the news in stride. Its shares edged 0.1 percent lower to close at $75.50 on a day the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which United Tech is a component, rose 0.7 percent.  For most of the past five years, United Tech has budgeted $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year for takeovers, regularly making deals that are small enough that the Hartford, Connecticut-based company does not disclose their size.  Company officials have repeatedly said they are interested in more deals, and in July Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes suggested United Tech would not shy away from larger targets.  “You’re going to see us put our balance sheet to work, you’re going to see us put more cash to work on the M&A side,” Hayes said. “That’s where I think a big piece of growth is going to come from in the next few years; it’s going to come from the M&A.”  United Tech officials have expressed particular interest in targets to merge into its Fire and Security and Hamilton Sundstrand security and aircraft components arms. Both divisions are below Chief Executive Louis Chenevert’s $10 billion annual revenue target.  Acquiring either Goodrich or Rockwell, which are big suppliers to United Tech, could help the company weather the expected downturn in defense spending in the United States and Europe by giving it a larger share of the smaller pie that will remain, according to industry executives.  U.S. congressional leaders last month agreed to cut $350 billion from national security spending over the next decade.  For some veterans of the industry, the decline in defense spending brings to mind the late 1980s and early 1990s, when top U.S. defense officials told companies they should consider joining forces to cut costs.  “This definitely feels like a return to those times,” said one industry executive. “There are a lot of second-tier companies that will very likely be absorbed.”  Being acquired by a conglomerate like United Tech could allow the target company to retain some independence. United Tech has five divisions that operate under their own brand names, including Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand.  Brian Langenberg, who follows United Tech at Langenberg & Co, said he would trust them to do a large-scale acquisition, even if it meant taking on substantial debt.  “You don’t get that many swings at something that size. It’s a disciplined company,” Langenberg said. “I’ve never seen them do something that doesn’t make sense.”  As of July, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners had done just $184 million in acquisitions this year and had $5.4 billion in cash on hand.  “UTX is well capitalized, corporate debt rates are near historical lows and the recent market sell-off has potentially made purchase prices a little more attractive,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard in a note to clients.  Chenevert, who came up through the company’s aerospace business and headed Pratt & Whitney before taking the top job, holds up his $1.8 billion acquisition of General Electric Co’s (GE.N) security business as the ideal deal.  In 2008, United Tech made a hostile $2.64 billion takeover offer for Diebold Inc (DBD.N), a maker of automated teller machines. That effort was ultimately fruitless, and Chenevert has since said he would be reluctant to go hostile again.

64,UTX,Factbox: Facts about United Tech's Louis Chenevert,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) named Louis Chenevert chairman on January 1, 2010, concluding a four-year transition of power at the diversified U.S. manufacturer from prior boss George David.  Below are some facts about Louis Chenevert:  * United Tech in March 2010 closed on its first big acquisition of the Chenevert era — a $1.8 billion takeover of General Electric Co (GE.N)’s security arm. During his tenure as CEO, automatic-teller machine maker Diebold Inc (DBD.N) rebuffed a hostile $2.6 billion United Tech bid. Following that experience, Chenevert said the company would shy away from future hostile takeover attempts.  * Before moving to United Tech’s Hartford, Connecticut headquarters in 2006, when he was named president and chief operating officer, Chenevert spent 13 years at the company’s Pratt & Whitney jet engine unit.  * Chenevert’s background is in manufacturing. He started his career at General Motors Co (GM.N), where he ran a Canadian plant — and one of his main focuses as CEO has been promoting an internal efficiency program called “Achieving Competitive Excellence.” His predecessor David once told the Wall Street Journal that Chenevert could determine if a factory was running smoothly after just 15 seconds on the floor.  * Chenevert was born and raised in Canada, but now holds U.S. citizenship.  * Just one of the executives who had been seen as Chenevert’s main internal rivals for the CEO job — Carrier president Gerard Darnis — remains with the company. Ari Bousbib, who Chenevert had named his No. 2, left in August 2010 to run a privately held healthcare consultancy in Connecticut.

66,UTX,FACTBOX-Facts about United Tech's Louis Chenevert," Sept 16 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) named Louis Chenevert chairman on Jan. 1, 2010, concluding a four-year transition of power at the diversified U.S. manufacturer from prior boss George David.   Below are some facts about Louis Chenevert:   * United Tech in March 2010 closed on its first big acquisition of the Chenevert era — a $1.8 billion takeover of General Electric Co (GE.N)’s security arm. During his tenure as CEO, automatic-teller machine maker Diebold Inc (DBD.N) rebuffed a hostile $2.6 billion United Tech bid. Following that experience, Chenevert said the company would shy away from future hostile takeover attempts.   * Before moving to United Tech’s Hartford, Connecticut headquarters in 2006, when he was named president and chief operating officer, Chenevert spent 13 years at the company’s Pratt & Whitney jet engine unit.   * Chenevert’s background is in manufacturing. He started his career at General Motors Co (GM.N), where he ran a Canadian plant — and one of his main focuses as CEO has been promoting an internal efficiency program called “Achieving Competitive Excellence.” His predecessor David once told the Wall Street Journal that Chenevert could determine if a factory was running smoothly after just 15 seconds on the floor.   * Chenevert was born and raised in Canada, but now holds U.S. citizenship.   * Just one of the executives who had been seen as Chenevert’s main internal rivals for the CEO job — Carrier president Gerard Darnis — remains with the company. Ari Bousbib, who Chenevert had named his No. 2, left in August 2010 to run a privately held healthcare consultancy in Connecticut.

68,UTX,"UPDATE 3-GE makes Russian push with energy, health ventures"," * Sees $10 bln to $15 bln in revenue over next few years   * Part of push to boost GE’s presence outside U.S.  (Adds interview with GE executive, details)   By Scott Malone   Sept 16 (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) formed two new joint ventures in Russia, in energy and healthcare, that the largest U.S. conglomerate said on Friday could generate $10 billion to $15 billion in new revenue over the next few years.   The move is part of a broad push by the world’s biggest maker of jet engines and electric turbines to expand its footprint in faster-growing economies outside its home market. GE expects to generate some 60 percent of its forecast $147.32 billion in 2011 revenue outside the United States.   Big markets including China, India and Russia have offered multinational companies including GE, United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) stronger growth opportunities as the U.S. and European economies have been sluggish. GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt on Thursday told reporters that growth in the United States was “decent” while the rest of the world was “fairly good.”   Russia in particular has rising demand for the sort of heavy equipment GE makes, said Ferdinando Beccalli-Falco, the head of GE’s European and North Asian businesses.   “Russia is one of the fastest markets that we have, particularly when you are talking about building and rebuilding the infrastructure,” Beccalli-Falco said in a phone interview. “It is a market that needs energy, needs health care, needs transportation, needs several different technologies where we are leaders in the market.”   Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE signed a joint venture with Russian holding company Inter RAO IUES.MM and UEC to make gas turbines and another with conglomerate Russian Technologies to make CT-scan machines.   GE noted that the Russian government believes the country needs to invest about $80 billion in power production equipment  over the next decade and more than $30 billion through 2014 on healthcare.   The company has also used joint ventures as a way of speeding its growth in China, another fast-growing market where the government takes a strong hand in economic policy.   “In these kinds of markets it is always better to be in a joint venture rather than to be totally by yourself,” Beccalli-Falco said. “It is a formula which is a good, successful formula that we know how to deal with.”   GE said it will hold 50 percent stakes in each joint venture in Russia and “exercise operational control over the businesses.”   Inter RAO and UEC will each hold a 25 percent stake in the energy joint venture, while Russian Technologies will hold a 50 percent stake in the healthcare joint venture.   GE’s other recent moves to boost its presence outside the United States included relocating Vice Chairman John Rice to Hong Kong — a move the company said would speed decision-making outside the United States — and moving the management of its X-ray business to China.   GE shares were up 1.3 percent at $16.29 on the New York Stock Exchange.

71,UTX,Europe propels Wall Street higher for week,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose for a fifth day in a row on Friday and the S&P 500 scored its best week since early July on signs euro zone leaders were acting together to limit any damage from its sovereign debt crisis.  The leaders took steps this week to show they were tackling the debt crisis, which has plagued markets for weeks, including coordinated central bank moves to give European banks greater access to funding in dollars.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner urged EU finance ministers to leverage their bailout fund to better tackle the debt crisis and to start speaking with one voice, but there was no agreement on what steps to take.  Still, the encouraging headlines out of Europe helped the S&P 500 post a 5.4 percent gain for the week, its best since early July, and the five-day string of gains was the broad index’s strongest since the end of June.  The Nasdaq composite index registered its best weekly percentage advance since July 2009, reflecting strength in technology shares on Friday. The S&P tech index .GSPT rose 1 percent, while the S&P consumer discretionary index .GSPD also gained 1 percent.  “The market seems to be a little bit more reassured that (their) support will not allow for a major disruption in Europe,” said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Maryland, which manages about $14.8 billion.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended up 75.91 points, or 0.66 percent, at 11,509.09. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 6.90 points, or 0.57 percent, at 1,216.01. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 15.24 points, or 0.58 percent, at 2,622.31.  The Nasdaq gained 6.3 percent for the week while the Dow rose 4.7 percent.  Still, major obstacles must be overcome in solving the euro zone’s debt crisis.  Less than 75 percent of private sector creditors have signaled they will take part in a scheme to buy back Greek debt, far less than the 90 percent target set by Greece. The shortfall could jeopardize the planned second bailout package for Athens.  Greece’s international lenders said on Friday they would delay a crucial visit to the country next week, and European finance ministers demanded that Athens fulfill its pledges to win further aid.  After the market’s close, Moody’s Investors Service left Italy’s Aa2 foreign sovereign currency credit rating unchanged but reiterated that it remained on review for a possible downgrade.  Among U.S. stocks, General Electric Co (GE.N) gained 1.6 percent to $16.33 after forming two new joint ventures in Russia that it said could generate $10 billion to $15 billion in new revenue over the next few years.  Another Dow component, United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), is lining up financing for a major acquisition in the United States, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

72,UTX,"UPDATE 7-UTX seeks $10-20 bln, Goodrich may be target"," * UTX seeks financing for big acquisition - sources   * Goodrich shares soar on speculation of UTX interest   * CNBC says deal could come as early as next week   * UTX move could spur new wave of aerospace consolidation  (Adds CNBC report on price talk)   By Nadia Damouni, Philipp Halstrick and Soyoung Kim   Sept 16 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is lining up $10 billion to $20 billion in financing for a U.S. acquisition that could shape up as its biggest takeover in a decade, said people with direct knowledge of the matter.   Investors bid up shares of smaller aerospace companies on the news, with speculation increasingly focused on Goodrich Corp GR.N as the most likely target of the diversified U.S. manufacturer.   A move by United Tech could mark the start of a more aggressive phase of consolidation in the aerospace sector to prepare for cuts in defense spending in the United States and Europe.   Goodrich, which is benefiting from rising demand for equipment for large commercial aircraft, makes the most strategic sense for United Tech, according to people familiar with the industry but not directly involved in the deal. Its chief executive, Marshall Larsen, is also preparing to retire in the next couple of years.   Shares of Goodrich rose 7.4 percent on the NYSE. The stock surged another 20 percent after-hours to $112, valuing Goodrich at about $14 billion, after CNBC’s David Faber reported that United Tech is expected to offer between $110 and $125 a share for the company and a deal could come as early as next week.   Officials at United Tech, which makes products ranging from helicopters to air conditioners, declined to comment, as did those at Goodrich.   Mergers could help the industry lower costs and boost capacity to meet booming demand for components used in commercial aircraft.   A mid-tier aerospace company joining the United Tech group would gain access to more work, said Jim McAleese, a Washington-based defense consultant.   “It would also expand United Technologies’ footprint into the premium commercial aerospace portfolios, beyond their current work in engines through Pratt & Whitney,” he said.   Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) is also a good strategic fit for United Tech, industry insiders said, although compared to Goodrich, its revenue is more dependent on the defense sector.   Shares of Rockwell Collins closed up 7.8 percent on the NYSE to give it a market value of $8.6 billion. Cessna aircraft maker Textron Inc (TXT.N) shares finished 6.8 percent higher for a market value of $5.2 billion.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Graphic of United Tech deals:  r.reuters.com/byx73s  Facts about United Tech CEO Chenevert      [ID:nS1E78F1JE]   Reuters Insider looks at a possible United-Goodrich deal:   link.reuters.com/faz73s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   United Tech, which has a market value of about $68 billion, is still working on terms of an offer and any potential bid could still fall apart, said the people with direct knowledge of the situation. They asked not to be identified as the plans are confidential.   Such a deal would be United Tech’s largest takeover since its unsuccessful bid for Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) in 2000. Since then, its largest acquisitions have been in the $1 billion to $3 billion range as it built up its fire and security division.   United Tech shareholders took the news in stride. Its shares edged 0.1 percent lower to close at $75.50 on a day the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which United Tech is a component, rose 0.7 percent.   For most of the past five years, United Tech has budgeted $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year for takeovers, regularly making deals that are small enough that the Hartford, Connecticut-based company does not disclose their size.   Company officials have repeatedly said they are interested in more deals, and in July Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes suggested United Tech would not shy away from larger targets.   “You’re going to see us put our balance sheet to work, you’re going to see us put more cash to work on the M&A side,” Hayes said. “That’s where I think a big piece of growth is going to come from in the next few years; it’s going to come from the M&A.”   United Tech officials have expressed particular interest in targets to merge into its Fire and Security and Hamilton Sundstrand security and aircraft components arms. Both divisions are below Chief Executive Louis Chenevert’s $10 billion annual revenue target.   Acquiring either Goodrich or Rockwell, which are big suppliers to United Tech, could help the company weather the expected downturn in defense spending in the United States and Europe by giving it a larger share of the smaller pie that will remain, according to industry executives.   U.S. congressional leaders last month agreed to cut $350 billion from national security spending over the next decade.   For some veterans of the industry, the decline in defense spending brings to mind the late 1980s and early 1990s, when top U.S. defense officials told companies they should consider joining forces to cut costs.   “This definitely feels like a return to those times,” said one industry executive. “There are a lot of second-tier companies that will very likely be absorbed.”   Being acquired by a conglomerate like United Tech could allow the target company to retain some independence. United Tech has five divisions that operate under their own brand names, including Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand.   Brian Langenberg, who follows United Tech at Langenberg & Co, said he would trust them to do a large-scale acquisition, even if it meant taking on substantial debt.   “You don’t get that many swings at something that size. It’s a disciplined company,” Langenberg said. “I’ve never seen them do something that doesn’t make sense.”   As of July, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners had done just $184 million in acquisitions this year and had $5.4 billion in cash on hand.   “UTX is well capitalized, corporate debt rates are near historical lows and the recent market sell-off has potentially made purchase prices a little more attractive,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard in a note to clients.   Chenevert, who came up through the company’s aerospace business and headed Pratt & Whitney before taking the top job, holds up his $1.8 billion acquisition of General Electric Co’s (GE.N) security business as the ideal deal.   In 2008, United Tech made a hostile $2.64 billion takeover offer for Diebold Inc (DBD.N), a maker of automated teller machines. That effort was ultimately fruitless, and Chenevert has since said he would be reluctant to go hostile again.

76,UTX,Goodrich shares up as United Tech mulls bid,"(Reuters) - Goodrich Corp GR.N shares surged 16 percent on Monday as diversified U.S. manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) negotiated terms for a potential purchase of the aircraft components maker.  Discussions were progressing on Monday, but the two companies have not yet reached a deal on price, people familiar with the situation said.  “There are still some steps to go through, including getting regulatory approval,” one of the people said. “This is by no means a done deal.”  One analyst said Goodrich could fetch as much as $128 per share in a deal. The company’s shares closed up $14.71 at $107.60, shooting past an all-time high of $99.67 reached in July. It has a market capitalization of $13.5 billion.  United Tech is lining up $10 billion to $20 billion in financing for the deal, people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday.  An acquisition of Goodrich would be the biggest deal in a decade for United Tech, which makes Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Otis elevators and Carrier heating and air conditioning systems.  Adding Goodrich would help United Technologies build critical mass in aerospace as rising demand for fuel-saving aircraft spurs airline orders. At the same time, new aircraft programs such as the Boeing Co (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner and Airbus EAD.PA A320neo — which Goodrich supplies — are set to ramp up production.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Goodrich’s aircraft products include landing gear and wheels and brakes, fuel pumping systems, seating and nacelles, the enclosed structure in which the engine is housed or cargo is carried.  The company has topped Wall Street profit estimates this year as the aftermarket, or sales tied to service and parts, gained strength.  “People believe in the commercial aerospace cycle,” said Ben Elias, an industrials analyst with Sterne Agee who follows United Tech. Goodrich “gets UTX into other parts of the plane where they are not,” he added.  Goodrich could also provide a buffer for United Tech as some of its units face headwinds because of a declining defense spending outlook.  “There’s also fears of a significant military downturn and leveraging strong commercial revenue to gird yourself against a military downturn makes sense too,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group.  Still, a deal could face regulatory issues around overlap in the areas of service and maintenance, production of nacelles and landing gear, said industry executives. But they added they did not expect significant opposition from defense officials.  Pentagon did not have an immediate comment on potential regulatory issues involved in the deal.  Sources familiar with the negotiations said on Monday there was no guarantee a deal could be reached.  United Tech CEO Louis Chenevert is seen as a tough negotiator and could walk away if Goodrich’s price demands are deemed excessive, the first source said.  “He wants to make a smart decision. He wants a good deal, but he doesn’t want to overpay either,” the source said.  In 2008, Chenevert pulled out of a hostile $2.64 billion takeover offer for Diebold Inc (DBD.N), a maker of automated teller machines and has since said he would be reluctant to go hostile again.  Goodrich could be worth $110 a share over 12 months and could see further upside to $118 in 24 months, FBR Capital Markets analyst Patrick McCarthy wrote in a note to clients.  “The risk is that one could argue the stock is worth $127 to $128 on a takeout,” he wrote.  Meanwhile, avionics suppler Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N), which had also been mentioned as a possible takeover candidate for United Tech, closed down 4 percent at $53.87. United Tech remained nearly unchanged at $75.55.  ",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-goodrich-shares/goodrich-shares-up-as-united-tech-mulls-bid-idUSTRE78I3CF20110919

78,UTX,Tyco to split into three companies; shares rise,"(Reuters) - U.S. conglomerate Tyco International TYC.N plans to split into three publicly traded companies, positioning itself for expected consolidation in its diverse businesses and potentially making it easier for its operations to be acquired.  Tyco’s move was seen as the final unwinding of an industrial giant that for a decade has worked to repair its image after a fraud scandal. Analysts and investors named global industrial names like Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA), General Electric (GE.N) and United Technologies (UTX.N) as potential buyers.  Tyco, which was built through acquisitions, said the split would allow its three businesses — ADT North America residential security, flow-control products and services, and its fire and commercial security business — to have more options for growth, both from within and through acquisitions.  Tyco, which has a market capitalization of about $20 billion, acknowledged the businesses could be sold and said it considered a break-up as much as four years ago before deciding to improve the businesses first.  Sum of the parts analyses of Tyco range widely, with some analysts estimating it is worth $50 a share or $23.2 billion. Others, including JPMorgan, put the value at $65, or $30 billion, based on prior security and flow control deals.  If acquirers were to bid for a piece of the company, Tyco would weigh any offers, “but that’s not our plan,” Chief Executive Ed Breen told analysts on a conference call.  “I’m a big believer there’s going to be consolidation in these industries ... and we want our businesses to be able to play in that environment,” Breen said.  Asked if one of the companies could be acquired immediately after the split, he replied, “That could happen.”  The move marks the final act of Breen’s nearly decade-long stewardship of a company he inherited in the midst of crisis, said Kent Croft, co-manager of the Croft Value Fund, a longtime Tyco shareholder.  “He’s done a very good job,” Croft said. “There’s nothing prohibiting someone from buying one of the companies.”  Tyco has been streamlining for a decade, “and this kind of completes it,” said Bryan Keane, co-manager of the Alpine Accelerating Dividend Fund, which holds Tyco shares.  Tyco was built up through acquisitions under former CEO Dennis Kozlowski, who is serving a prison sentence for fraud.  Shares of Tyco, which has outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 index under Breen, closed 2.4 percent higher at $44.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Individual pieces of Tyco could be attractive to a long list of acquirers, said analyst Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.  “We see all three pieces as possible takeover candidates,” Sprague said.  The ADT business could be attractive to AT&T (T.N), Verizon (VZ.N), Comcast (CMCSA.O), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK.N) or a private equity buyer, he said.  Possible buyers for the commercial fire and security business include France’s Schneider, Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and U.S.-based United Technologies, Honeywell International (HON.N) and Johnson Controls (JCI.N), Sprague said.  United Tech or GE could be interested in the flow-control business, he said, or the unit could merge with ITT’s flow unit, Flowserve (FLS.N) or Swiss-based Sulzer AG (SUN.S).  Although several companies with disparate businesses have moved to break up in recent months, analysts and investors said such moves are specific to each company and do not necessarily mark a wider shift away from the conglomerate model.  Consumer companies Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N and Ralcorp Holdings RAH.N, credit rating agency owner and book publisher McGraw-Hill MHP.N, and giant energy company ConocoPhillips (COP.N) have announced plans to split their businesses. Also, ITT Corp (ITT.N) plans to spin its defense and water segments into separate companies.  The break-up of Tyco is the latest step in a nearly decade-long transformation of the conglomerate. Breen first broke up the company in 2007, spinning off its electronics division, now called TE Connectivity (TEL.N), and its healthcare company, now named Covidien COV.N.  He greatly expanded the security business with the $1.9 billion acquisition of Broadview Security in 2010.  “Breen has once and for all buried the sad chapter of ... Kozlowski,” said Anthony Michael Sabino of St. John’s University’s Peter J. Tobin College of Business. “Breen came in, restored order, and got the ship back on course.”  Tyco expects to complete the split-up within a year. It estimated refinancing and other costs at $700 million.  Goldman Sachs and Lazard acted as financial advisers to the company.  The ADT North America residential business, which provides security and fire alarm systems in North America to more than 6 million homes and small businesses, will have annual revenue of about $3 billion and 16,000 employees. Plans call for it to be incorporated in the United States.  The flow-control business, with annual revenue of $4 billion and 15,000 employees, sells valves and thermal controls for energy and other markets. It is expected to be incorporated outside the United States.  Tyco will combine the remaining commercial security business with its fire protection segment to form the largest new company, with annual revenue of $10 billion and 69,000 employees. Breen may be nonexecutive chairman of this business, while taking supporting roles at the others.  Tyco’s commercial fire protection business sells fire detection and suppression systems, while the security business serves commercial, industrial and government customers.

81,UTX,UTX exploring Goodrich takeover: sources,"(Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is exploring a takeover of aerospace company Goodrich Corp GR.N but the two sides are not yet close to a deal, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.  Reuters reported on Friday that United Technologies was lining up $10 billion to $20 billion in financing for a U.S. acquisition that could shape up as its biggest takeover in a decade.  Investors bid up shares of aerospace companies on the news, with speculation increasingly focused on Goodrich. The stock rose to as high as $112 in after-hours trading on Friday, valuing Goodrich at $14 billion.  A move by United Tech could mark the start of a more aggressive phase of consolidation in the aerospace sector to prepare for cuts in defense spending in the United States and Europe.  Mergers could help the industry lower costs and boost capacity to meet booming demand for components used in commercial aircraft.  Goodrich is benefiting from rising demand for equipment for large planes and sales tied to servicing and parts.  The company has solid exposure to growing commercial aircraft programs. For instance, it supplies a host of parts to EADS unit Airbus, and will design the nacelle and thrust reversers for the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engine that is an option for the A320neo aircraft family.  Charlotte, N.C.-based Goodrich also supplies electronic braking and a host of other critical systems to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which got U.S. government approval to enter into commercial passenger service last month (August 2011).  Defense and space accounts for about one-third of total Goodrich sales. The company has focused its military strategy on products that guide missiles and gather and process intelligence data.  CEO Marshall Larsen, a 34-year company veteran, told Reuters in June that he’ll reach Goodrich’s mandatory retirement age of 65 in a couple of years. He was named chairman, president and CEO in October 2003.  Officials at United Tech, which makes products ranging from air-conditioners to helicopters, declined to comment, as did those at Goodrich.

82,UTX,PRESS DIGEST - Wall Street Journal - Sept 19," Sept 19 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in The Wall Street Journal on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.	   * Obama will offer a new plan to reduce the federal deficit by about $3.6 trillion over a decade, almost half of which would come from tax increases, people familiar with the proposal said.	   * President Barack Obama’s proposal to raise taxes on some millionaires will likely please members of his party, but it is unlikely to have much practical impact on federal deficits anytime soon.	   * The online daily-deals space has attracted millions of dollars in venture capital and spurred dozens of clones of market leaders Groupon and LivingSocial.

83,UTX,"Exclusive: United Tech, Goodrich near deal: sources","(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is negotiating the final terms of an all-cash acquisition of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp GR.N with the goal of reaching a deal in the next few days, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.  General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which were seen as the only possible contenders big enough to buy Goodrich, are unlikely to enter a bidding war, according to several people familiar with the companies’ thinking.  People familiar with the discussion between United Technologies and Goodrich declined to elaborate on the likely price and cautioned the talks could still fall apart.  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is advising United Tech and also offering financing, while Goodrich is being advised by Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX and Citigroup Inc (C.N), the sources said.  An acquisition of Goodrich, which has a market capitalization of about $14 billion, would be the biggest deal in a decade for United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Otis elevators and Carrier heating and air conditioning systems.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Goodrich’s aircraft products include landing gear and wheels and brakes, fuel pumping systems, seating and nacelles, the enclosed structure in which the engine is housed or cargo is carried.  Adding Goodrich would help United Technologies build critical mass in aerospace as rising demand for fuel-saving aircraft spurs airline orders.  At the same time, new aircraft programs such as the Boeing Co (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner and Airbus EAD.PA A320neo — which Goodrich supplies — are set to ramp up production.  Goodrich could also provide a buffer for United Technologies as some of its units face headwinds because of a declining defense spending outlook.  Reuters first reported on Friday that United Tech was lining up financing of $10 billion to $20 billion for a takeover of a U.S. company.  Goodrich would be a “game changer for the company and a catalyst for additional M&A,” said Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis for the Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy in Fairfax, Virginia.  “This will put pressure on competitors of United Technologies to make their own deals, to broaden their own abilities, to create more integrated systems,” he added.  Industry executives said there would be some overlap in the areas of service and maintenance, making nacelles and landing gear, but said they did not expect significant opposition from defense officials.  While a full review of any anti-trust issues only kicks in after a deal is formally announced, no major concerns have been flagged, according to one of the people familiar with the negotiations.  Goodrich shares closed 3.9 percent higher at $111.82 on the New York Stock Exchange, while United Tech rose 0.6 percent to $76.01.  Representatives of United Technologies, Goodrich, Honeywell and GE declined to comment. JPMorgan, Citi and Credit Suisse also declined to comment.

85,UTX,Goodrich shares up as United Tech mulls bid,"(Reuters) - Goodrich Corp GR.N shares surged 16 percent on Monday as diversified U.S. manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) negotiated terms for a potential purchase of the aircraft components maker.  Discussions were progressing on Monday, but the two companies have not yet reached a deal on price, people familiar with the situation said.  “There are still some steps to go through, including getting regulatory approval,” one of the people said. “This is by no means a done deal.”  One analyst said Goodrich could fetch as much as $128 per share in a deal. The company’s shares closed up $14.71 at $107.60, shooting past an all-time high of $99.67 reached in July. It has a market capitalization of $13.5 billion.  United Tech is lining up $10 billion to $20 billion in financing for the deal, people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday.  An acquisition of Goodrich would be the biggest deal in a decade for United Tech, which makes Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Otis elevators and Carrier heating and air conditioning systems.  Adding Goodrich would help United Technologies build critical mass in aerospace as rising demand for fuel-saving aircraft spurs airline orders. At the same time, new aircraft programs such as the Boeing Co (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner and Airbus EAD.PA A320neo — which Goodrich supplies — are set to ramp up production.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Goodrich’s aircraft products include landing gear and wheels and brakes, fuel pumping systems, seating and nacelles, the enclosed structure in which the engine is housed or cargo is carried.  The company has topped Wall Street profit estimates this year as the aftermarket, or sales tied to service and parts, gained strength.  “People believe in the commercial aerospace cycle,” said Ben Elias, an industrials analyst with Sterne Agee who follows United Tech. Goodrich “gets UTX into other parts of the plane where they are not,” he added.  Goodrich could also provide a buffer for United Tech as some of its units face headwinds because of a declining defense spending outlook.  “There’s also fears of a significant military downturn and leveraging strong commercial revenue to gird yourself against a military downturn makes sense too,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group.  Still, a deal could face regulatory issues around overlap in the areas of service and maintenance, production of nacelles and landing gear, said industry executives. But they added they did not expect significant opposition from defense officials.  Pentagon did not have an immediate comment on potential regulatory issues involved in the deal.  Sources familiar with the negotiations said on Monday there was no guarantee a deal could be reached.  United Tech CEO Louis Chenevert is seen as a tough negotiator and could walk away if Goodrich’s price demands are deemed excessive, the first source said.  “He wants to make a smart decision. He wants a good deal, but he doesn’t want to overpay either,” the source said.  In 2008, Chenevert pulled out of a hostile $2.64 billion takeover offer for Diebold Inc (DBD.N), a maker of automated teller machines and has since said he would be reluctant to go hostile again.  Goodrich could be worth $110 a share over 12 months and could see further upside to $118 in 24 months, FBR Capital Markets analyst Patrick McCarthy wrote in a note to clients.  “The risk is that one could argue the stock is worth $127 to $128 on a takeout,” he wrote.  Meanwhile, avionics suppler Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N), which had also been mentioned as a possible takeover candidate for United Tech, closed down 4 percent at $53.87. United Tech remained nearly unchanged at $75.55.  ",9202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-goodrich-shares/goodrich-shares-up-as-united-tech-mulls-bid-idUSTRE78I3CF20110920
86,UTX,China warns against U.S. F-16 upgrade for Taiwan,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The Obama administration told the U.S. Congress on Wednesday that it planned a $5.3 billion upgrade of Taiwan’s F-16 fighter fleet, angering Beijing but disappointing new arms-sales advocates.  China condemned the retrofit of Lockheed Martin Corp F-16 A/Bs sold in 1992 as a “grave interference” in its internal affairs and warned that it will damage military and security ties with the United States.  In January 2010, China froze military-to-military ties and threatened sanctions against U.S. arms makers after President Barack Obama approved a potential $6.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan left over from the administration of George W. Bush, including Black Hawk helicopters, Patriot anti-missile missiles and two refurbished Osprey-class mine-hunting ships.  The upgrade of the 145 F-16s will give them essentially the same capabilities as late-model F-16 C/Ds that Taiwan has sought for five years without success, U.S. officials said. They said Taiwan would get the capability sooner and cheaper, a point of contention with advocates of new F-16s.  The administration also notified Congress that it planned a five-year, $500 million extension of F-16 pilot training at Luke Air Force Base and to sell $52 million in spare parts for Taiwan’s F-16s, F-5s, and C-130s. All together, the potential sales total $5.85 billion.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Taiwan was an “internal matter” that affected China’s territorial integrity and the national feelings of 1.3 billion Chinese people.  “China urges the U.S. to clearly understand the acute sensitivity and serious harmfulness of selling arms to Taiwan, and to treat China’s solemn stance seriously,” Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun said.  Beijing deems Taiwan a renegade province and sees U.S. arms sales to the self-ruled island as the top obstacle to improved ties between the United States and China, now the world’s two biggest economies.  China has shown no sign of ending an arms build-up that is focused on Taiwan. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.  Taiwan’s military supply options are limited to the United States, with other countries refusing to sell it weapons, fearing an angry Chinese response.  In Taipei, Taiwan’s defense ministry said the F-16 upgrade will contribute to regional peace by improving its defense capability in the face of what it called a continued threat from China.  Taiwan would continue to press for newer F-16s to replace its F-5 fighters that are more than 30 years old, the ministry said in a statement.  The retrofit will provide a substantial increase in the survivability, reliability and combat capabilities of the F-16A/Bs, said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.  “This will help ensure that Taiwan maintains the capability to protect its airspace in both peacetime and during any crisis,” she said in a statement.  The United States firmly believes that its arms sales to Taiwan contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, Nuland added in a statement.  Taiwan’s request for new F-16s remains under consideration, Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary of state for the region, said at a news conference in New York.  The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, whose members include arms maker Lockheed Martin, said the correct approach would be to have both programs running sequentially, so that new F-16 C/Ds would be delivered to Taiwan before it starts pulling front-line F-16 A/Bs out of operations.  “As presently structured, Taiwan will actually see a reduction in the number of operational F-16s over the next 10 years,” council president Rupert Hammond-Chambers said.  The Pentagon said in its notice to Congress that Taiwan had requested 176 state-of-the-art Active Electronically Scanned Array, or AESA, radar sets, in addition to a long list of advanced air-to-air missiles, laser- and GPS-guided bombs and other weapons systems for its F-16 fleet.  AESA radar “offers a significant capability that would be able to maintain Taiwan’s qualitative advantage” over currently deployed Chinese fighters, said Mark Stokes, a former Pentagon China desk chief who heads the Project 2049 Institute, an Asia security research group.  Raytheon Co and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) are expected to compete to supply the AESA radar sets.  The deal also would include 140 of the latest version of heat-seeking Raytheon AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles and 128 Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing systems, which let pilots fire on targets from multiple angles without turning their heads or the plane.  In the U.S. Congress, 47 of the 100 U.S. senators and 181 of the 435 members of the House of Representatives have written to President Barack Obama since May to urge him to sell Taiwan the 66 late-model F-16 C/D planes it has sought since 2006.  The Obama administration is required by law to notify Congress of any proposed major arms sale. The sale may go ahead after 30 days unless Congress enacts a joint resolution blocking it in the allotted time.  Senator John Cornyn has proposed mandating the sale of at least 66 new F-16 C/D fighters to Taiwan as an amendment to legislation now being considered on the Senate floor.  Cornyn is a Republican from Texas, where Lockheed Martin manufactures the F-16. He said in a floor speech that Congress should pass his bill because, he said, China “respects only strength, not weakness.” He has emphasized the jobs that building new planes would bring and the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which requires the U.S. government to provide Taiwan sufficient arms for its defense.  Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney deplored Obama’s refusal to sell Taiwan new jets as “yet another example of his weak leadership in foreign policy.”  ",9212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan/china-warns-against-u-s-f-16-upgrade-for-taiwan-idUSTRE78K70420110921

There was no immediate reaction to the U.S. announcement from Beijing.   But in comments posted earlier on Wednesday on the website of the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, a People’s Liberation Army major general said the United States had withheld from selling new F-16 jets “because it foresaw a strong reaction from mainland China.”   “It was wise for President Obama not to approve selling F-16 C/Ds to Taiwan, but approving the upgrades of the F-16s was totally in error,” Major General Luo Yuan said.   “The United States is trying to swindle and bamboozle the Chinese people by using a new guise for old tricks in selling weapons to Taiwan, and China should copy Russia in implementing smart retaliation,” Luo was reported as saying.

90,UTX,Merger bankers seek action as economies sink,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions slowed significantly in the third quarter, stymied by economic uncertainty that stifled the confidence and growth horizons of corporate executives, according to Wall Street dealmakers.  The few companies eager to seize on opportunities are bumping up against reluctant lenders.  High-yield debt that serial acquirers in the private equity world rely on for deal-making has become harder to find, in part because troubled European banks are bowing out of financing deals. Private-equity backed M&A, which typically relies heavily on junk-bond financing, is down 22 percent from the last quarter.  “The steady M&A flow has turned to a drip,” said Paul Parker, head of global M&A at Barclays Capital (BARC.L), who like many of his Street cohorts is paring back expectations for the rest of 2011.  Announced M&A deals for the volatile third quarter will have declined about 23 percent from the previous three months, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence, as stock market fluctuations, the European debt crisis and the U.S. budget stalemate put many planned deals on ice.  Indeed, the $16.5 billion purchase of Goodrich Corp GR.N that United Technologies (UTX.N) unveiled on Wednesday was on track for an August announcement before wild market gyrations sidetracked deal talks, a source familiar with the deal said.  The good news is that well-capitalized companies such as United Technologies can get financing when they want it.  “I still think there is a strong desire to do M&A but it is hard to do with these levels of uncertainty,” said Jeff Raich, co-founder of Los Angeles-based investment bank Moelis & Co.  Bankers are eternal optimists, of course, and Raich and others said that once economic and geopolitical clouds clear, deal books will circulate again.  The global deal count for the first nine months is up 20 percent over last year, mostly due to strength in the first half of the year, the data shows. Deals in the third quarter, through September 22, fell to $539 billion from $699 billion in the previous quarter, according to Deals Intelligence.  Europe and Asia Pacific have been hit particularly hard, with deals in each region falling 34 percent from the previous quarter.  Parker fingered the lack of financing for deals involving noninvestment-grade companies as a significant cause of the drag.  “A number of deals have gone sideways,” he said, “but I’d expect many of those situations to be resurrected when the markets rebound.”  Investment-grade companies have had more luck, bankers said, but even they have bumped up against tighter lending as banks fret over the effects of the European debt crisis, according to one senior energy investment banker.  Joseph Frumkin, managing partner of Sullivan & Cromwell’s mergers & acquisitions group, said lead lenders who sell part of their loan commitments to other banks have become increasingly edgy.  “As the U.S. banks form syndicates, you can see concerns about European banks participating in syndicates,” the lawyer said. “What if they don’t make good on their commitments?”  One bright spot for bankers is that the size of deals announced in the quarter increased to an average of $155.9 million, the second-highest level in the last three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Big deals generate big fees, which has Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and other bankers celebrating. Goldman, the top global M&A adviser this year, shepherded shale gas producer Petrohawk Energy in its $12.1 billion sale to BHP Billiton. (BHP.AX) (BLT.L)  JPMorgan was one of the advisers to Medco Health Services Inc MHS.N on its $29.1 billion planned sale to Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX.O)  Large companies with strong reserves of cash will continue to be aggressive, in spite of the current uncertainty, bankers insist.  “In volatile markets like the ones we are experiencing, we are advising our clients to be well-prepared in order to be in a position to move decisively when market windows open,” said Jake Donavan, JPMorgan’s head of corporates and client coverage for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Even bankers’ optimism has limits, however. After starting with a bang, deal volume for 2011 is on track to end only 5 to 10 percent higher than last year, Parker estimated. That points to a dreadful fourth quarter since deal value is currently about 20 percent up from last year.  Scott Matlock, Morgan Stanley’s (MS.N) London-based chairman of international M&A said that the themes that drove healthier dealmaking last year — strong cash balances and available financing — are still present.  “Uncertainty about the global economy is the swing factor that could impact the next few quarters,” he said.

91,UTX,JPMorgan takes top spot in U.S. league tables,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chris Ventresca, JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM.N) co-head of North American M&A, still remembers the banker he worked for on his first deal as a young associate back in 1994.  It’s easy. The banker, Henry Harnischfeger, is still at JPMorgan and doing deals.  Such stability while many rivals have been walloped by crises, JP Morgan bankers said, has helped place their firm in the lead in the rankings of deal advisers this year.  “Keeping our focus on clients externally while others may have had more distractions or more volatility in terms of their people — that’s probably our greatest strength over the years,” said Ventresca, 45, a Princeton electrical engineer who started out at JPMorgan in 1988 as a computer programer and never left.  The firm has jumped to the top spot in U.S. league tables from No. 5 last year, racing ahead of archrivals Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), according to Thomson Reuters data through September 22.  JPMorgan has advised on $353.5 billion worth of deals involving U.S. companies so far this year, compared with about $295 billion each for Morgan Stanley and Goldman.  JPMorgan strengthened its position further late on Wednesday as United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) lead adviser on a $16.5 billion deal to buy Goodrich Corp GR.N.  The deal also helped the firm edge past Morgan Stanley to the No. 2 spot globally in league tables, the data shows.  In the United Technologies deal, the bank had a relationship with the company that goes back more than a decade.  Besides being the M&A adviser, JPMorgan is also the lead bank in a $15 billion financing for the deal and advised the company on other issues including selling shares and credit ratings.  “We surround these transactions,” said Jim Woolery, co-head of North American M&A. “We not only come at them from a strategic advisory and board perspective, but from a capital markets perspective as well.”  Still, competition for M&A business is fierce — Goldman is currently the No. 1 M&A bank globally.  League table fortunes are also fickle. At a time when deal activity is down, a few big deals can skew rankings from one year to the next.  Over the last few years, however, JPMorgan has firmly held on to a spot among the top three M&A advisers, data shows.  The bank received a further boost early this year, when a management reshuffle saw it bring on Woolery, 42, from the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore.  The reshuffle has led to initiatives such as greater focus on building board relationships at client firms as directors become more active after the financial crisis.  The bank is looking to hire selectively to boost its takeover defense and technology practices, as well as grow aggressively in the middle-market and emerging markets, the bankers said.  A big focus is tapping JPMorgan’s commercial bank relationships, they said.  Woolery said he and Ventresca spend a fair amount of time helping other divisions — such as capital markets, private banking and escrow — sell services as part of a JPMorgan culture to get people to work together.  “That comes back to us five-fold,” he said. “The M&A team doesn’t hide the ball from leveraged finance or FX; we work together as a team. A lot of people talk about that but actually executing on that is hard. It comes straight from the top here.”  ",9222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan/jpmorgan-takes-top-spot-in-u-s-league-tables-idUSTRE78L7AW20110922

94,UTX,Dealtalk: UTC CEO wins over Goodrich after long courtship,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three years ago after an aborted hostile bid for teller machine maker Diebold Inc (DBD.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) Chief Executive Louis Chenevert pledged he would put forward a friendly face the next time.  In striking a $16.5 billion deal to acquire aircraft systems maker Goodrich Corp GR.N on Wednesday, Chenevert made sure he got Goodrich’s Marshall Larsen on his side.  Chenevert’s courtship started more than a year ago, when he first broached the possibility of a takeover to Larsen, people familiar with the matter said.  The chemistry between the two played a big role in the companies reaching a deal, according to the people. Although it was an all-cash takeover, Chenevert invited Larsen to the deal announcement and also has given him the task of running the combined aerospace systems business for United Technologies.  “This is one that has been on the radar screen, and I think it has been in the works for over a year between Marshall and I,” Chenevert said. “It’s going to be a happy transition.”  Larsen added: “During this time period where we’ve got to know Louis and United Technologies better, we’ve come to the belief that our cultures are not different.”  Goodrich, which makes equipment for large planes such as landing gear, wheels and brakes, and smaller aerospace component manufacturer Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N), were both seen for many years as attractive takeover targets for United Technologies as it looked to boost its commercial aerospace exposure. Its aerospace business has lagged growth in its commercial building units, which include Carrier air conditioners, Otis elevators and fire and security systems.  The Hartford, Connecticut, diversified conglomerate set its eyes firmly on Goodrich, which has solid exposure to key commercial plane programs such as the Boeing (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner and upcoming Airbus EAD.PA A320neo and is benefiting from the upswing in plane orders.  While Goodrich derives two-thirds of sales from commercial aerospace, Rockwell relies on its government division for roughly 60 percent of sales and has been under pressure from defense contract delays and program cuts.  “We don’t discuss our acquisition target but obviously we love aerospace,” Chenevert said. “We felt very good that on the list of opportunities this was absolute top of the list.”  United Technologies and Goodrich came close to a deal in early August, but the discussions were put on hold for several weeks as both companies’ stock prices swung widely amid the broader market turmoil, people familiar with the matter said.  Talks were reinvigorated in recent weeks and United Technologies then focused on lining up $15 billion in financing to seal the deal, the people said.  JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), which is the lead adviser for United Technologies, has committed financing along with Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L).  Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), while it did not participate in the deal discussions, also had a relationship with United Technologies and was later added as its financial adviser, people familiar with the matter said. Goldman representatives were not immediately available for comment.  Designation as an adviser on deals help banks rake in credit in M&A league tables, a powerful marketing tool in the investment banking business.

We’ll see where it goes long-term, it’s premature to call the shot here,” Chenevert said.  Law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as legal adviser to United Technologies.

97,UTX,UPDATE 4-United Tech makes biggest bet ever on Goodrich," * United Tech to issue $4.6 billion in new shares   * Will suspend buybacks for a year, cut other M&A spending   * Deal came after a year of talks   * United Tech shares fall 8 pct, Goodrich up 10 pct  (Adds Standard & Poor’s reviewing credit rating, analyst comment)   By Scott Malone   Sept 22 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) Louis Chenevert placed the biggest bet of his tenure as chief executive with a $16.5 billion cash deal for aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp GR.N.   It would be the largest acquisition ever for United Tech, boosting the diversified U.S. manufacturer’s presence in the civilian aerospace market. The company, worth $69 billion on the stock market, expects to issue $4.6 billion in new shares and take on about $15 billion in debt to fund the deal.   Goodrich had been on United Tech’s radar since the time of Chenevert’s predecessor as CEO, George David. Talks between Chenevert and Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen began more than a year ago, Chenevert said.   “There was no other property that offered the opportunities that Goodrich offers,” the Canada-born executive told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.   He dismissed reports that Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech had considered other targets in the sector, including Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N). “These other businesses are totally different than what we do. This one happens to do complementary products and systems,” he said.   While the deal looks strategically sound, the $127.50 per share offer price — a 47 percent premium on Goodrich shares before Reuters reported United Tech was on the prowl — was more than investors had expected, said Edward Jones analyst Matt Collins.   “We are disappointed that (United Tech) will be issuing stock to help pay for (Goodrich), in order to maintain its “A” credit rating,” Collins said.   Commercial aviation is expected to be a growth market in coming years, driven in part by strong demand in developing parts of Asia. Goodrich parts are used on Boeing Co’s (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner and Airbus’ A320neo.   Governments in the United States and Western Europe are preparing to cut military spending amid broad budget crunches. Those cutbacks could prompt a new wave of consolidation in the defense sector, with General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) seen as possible buyers.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   For a story on defense consolidation:      [ID:nS1E78I1I4]   Facts about United Tech CEO Chenevert      [ID:nS1E78F1JE]   For a related Breakingviews column:        [ID:nS1E78L0MT]   Graphic on United Tech deals:                              r.reuters.com/byx73s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   United Tech shares were down 8.3 percent on Thursday. Goodrich rose 10.2 percent, the day’s biggest gainer on the New York Stock Exchange.   Chenevert said he paid little attention to a one-day share slide.   “The market is what the market is going to be today,” he said. “I did this deal because in 10 years, 20 years from now, it (will have been) absolutely the right thing to do.”   Together, the companies will generate $66 billion in revenue this year, though the deal is not expected to close until mid-2012 and may not boost United Tech’s earnings for another two years after that.   United Tech will assume $1.9 billion of Goodrich debt.   United Tech currently generates 18 percent of its revenue from the U.S. military, and expects that percentage to rise a couple of points as a result of the deal. Goodrich generates about one-third of its revenue from military sales.   If successful, the deal will be United Tech’s largest acquisition ever. In 2000 it made a $36 billion offer for Honeywell but was outbid by General Electric Co (GE.N). The GE-Honeywell combination was ultimately nixed by European regulators.   United Tech, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, said it would throttle back on other spending for the next few years as it digests the Goodrich deal.   It also plans to freeze share buybacks through 2012, resuming them on a limited basis in 2013 and 2014, and will cut its typical takeover budget to $1 billion a year from $2 billion. Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said those moves were necessary to protect the company’s “A” credit rating, which he views as “sacrosanct.”   Standard & Poor’s lowered its credit outlook on United Tech to “negative” from “stable” as a result of the move, saying that it could lower its rating on the company as it issues new debt. Fitch also said it would review the company’s rating.   The company believes it will be able to generate $350 million to $400 million a year in cost savings through the combination with Goodrich, Hayes said.   JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is leading a $15 billion loan package to fund the deal, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) also involved.

98,UTX,United Tech makes biggest bet ever on Goodrich,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) Louis Chenevert placed the biggest bet of his tenure as chief executive with a $16.5 billion cash deal for aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp GR.N.  It would be the largest acquisition ever for United Tech, boosting the diversified U.S. manufacturer’s presence in the civilian aerospace market. The company, worth $69 billion on the stock market, expects to issue $4.6 billion in new shares and take on about $15 billion in debt to fund the deal.  Goodrich had been on United Tech’s radar since the time of Chenevert’s predecessor as CEO, George David. Talks between Chenevert and Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen began more than a year ago, Chenevert said.  “There was no other property that offered the opportunities that Goodrich offers,” the Canada-born executive told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.  He dismissed reports that Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech had considered other targets in the sector, including Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N). “These other businesses are totally different than what we do. This one happens to do complementary products and systems,” he said.  Commercial aviation is expected to be a growth market in coming years, driven in part by strong demand in developing parts of Asia. Goodrich parts are used on Boeing Co’s (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner and Airbus’ A320neo.  The deal comes at a time when governments in the United States and Western Europe are preparing to cut military spending amid broad budget crunches. Those cutbacks could prompt a new wave of consolidation in the defense sector, with General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) seen as possible buyers.  United Tech shares were down 8.3 percent on Thursday. Goodrich, which had already run up 26.6 percent since Reuters first reported United Tech was on the prowl last week, gained another 10.2 percent, the day’s biggest gainer on the New York Stock Exchange.  Chenevert said he paid little attention to a one-day share slide.  “The market is what the market is going to be today,” he said. “I did this deal because in 10 years, 20 years from now, it (will have been) absolutely the right thing to do.”  United Tech will merge its Hamilton Sundstrand aircraft electronics arm into Goodrich and call the new division United Technologies Aerospace Systems, with Larsen at the helm.  Together, the companies will generate $66 billion in revenue this year, though the deal is not expected to close until mid-2012 and may not boost United Tech’s earnings for another two years after that.  United Tech will assume $1.9 billion of Goodrich debt.  If successful, the deal will be United Tech’s largest acquisition ever. In 2000 it made a $36 billion offer for Honeywell but was outbid by General Electric Co (GE.N). The GE-Honeywell combination was ultimately nixed by European regulators.  United Tech, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, said it would throttle back on other spending for the next few years as it digests the Goodrich deal.  “We are going to minimize our M&A pool for the next couple years,” Chenevert said.  It also plans to freeze share buybacks through 2012, resuming them on a limited basis in 2013 and 2014, and will cut its typical takeover budget to $1 billion a year from $2 billion. Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said those moves were necessary to protect the company’s “A” credit rating, which he views as “sacrosanct.”  The company believes it will be able to generate $350 million to $400 million a year in cost savings through the combination with Goodrich, Hayes said.  “This may result in a negative credit ratings outlook, but we do not expect a downgrade or material increase in interest expense,” Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners wrote in a note to clients.  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is leading a $15 billion loan package to fund the deal, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) also involved.  United Tech shares were down $6.15 to $68.72 at midday, and Goodrich rose $11.20 to $120.69.

99,UTX,Goodrich's Larsen to take new role after takeover,"(Reuters) - Goodrich Corp GR.N Chief Executive Marshall Larsen found that selling the company he has spent 34 years with was the best strategy to take it to the next level.  United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is paying $16.5 billion for Goodrich, betting that the plane parts maker will help it capitalize on the current upswing in commercial aerospace.  After joining Goodrich in 1977, Larsen worked his way up through the jobs of general manager and vice president before becoming chief operating officer in 2002. He became chief executive and chairman in 2003.  As CEO, the West Point graduate and ex-Army officer moved manufacturing to lower-cost areas to improve profit margins while going after new sources of revenue. During his time at the helm, sales at Goodrich rose from $4.4 billion in 2003 to nearly $7 billion in 2010.  “Marshall Larsen has been very very aggressive in managing the cost side of the equation,” said Patrick McCarthy, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets.  As U.S. defense spending ramped up following the September 11 attacks, Goodrich added capabilities in military helicopter products and airborne missions data even as it won work on new commercial plane programs such as the Boeing (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner and Airbus EAD.PA A320neo.  For his efforts in reaching a sale deal at what McCarthy called a “terrific price” after more than a year of talks with United Tech, Larsen will lead a new division called United Technologies Aerospace systems. The unit will include the Hamilton Sundstrand aircraft electronics business and be based in Goodrich’s headquarters city of Charlotte, North Carolina.  The agreed price of $127.50 per Goodrich share represents a premium of 47 percent over where the shares were trading before Reuters first reported United Tech’s interest in Goodrich last week.  “It represents an opportunity for him to run a larger business, probably a more global business, and take some of the practices he applied so effectively at Goodrich to a larger organization,” McCarthy said.  Around Charlotte, Larsen is described as quiet and well-liked.  “He has a very strong presence — not many words, but a keen leadership sense,” said Ljubomir Stambuck, president of the nonprofit, nonpartisan World Affairs Council of Charlotte, which named Larsen its World Citizen for 2011. “People just follow him.”  ",9222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-goodrich-unitedtech-larsen/goodrichs-larsen-to-take-new-role-after-takeover-idUSTRE78L4QW20110922
100,UTX,Deals: Merger bankers seek action as economies sink,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions slowed significantly in the third quarter, stymied by economic uncertainty that stifled the confidence and growth horizons of corporate executives, according to Wall Street dealmakers.  The few companies eager to seize on opportunities are bumping up against reluctant lenders.  High-yield debt that serial acquirers in the private equity world rely on for deal-making has become harder to find, in part because troubled European banks are bowing out of financing deals. Private-equity backed M&A, which typically relies heavily on junk-bond financing, is down 22 percent from the last quarter.  “The steady M&A flow has turned to a drip,” said Paul Parker, head of global M&A at Barclays Capital (BARC.L), who like many of his Street cohorts is paring back expectations for the rest of 2011.  Announced M&A deals for the volatile third quarter will have declined about 23 percent from the previous three months, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence, as stock market fluctuations, the European debt crisis and the U.S. budget stalemate put many planned deals on ice.  Indeed, the $16.5 billion purchase of Goodrich Corp GR.N that United Technologies (UTX.N) unveiled on Wednesday was on track for an August announcement before wild market gyrations sidetracked deal talks, a source familiar with the deal said.  The good news is that well-capitalized companies such as United Technologies can get financing when they want it.  “I still think there is a strong desire to do M&A but it is hard to do with these levels of uncertainty,” said Jeff Raich, co-founder of New York-based investment bank Moelis & Co.  Bankers are eternal optimists, of course, and Raich and others said that once economic and geopolitical clouds clear, deal books will circulate again.  The global deal count for the first nine months is up 20 percent over last year, mostly due to strength in the first half of the year, the data shows. Deals in the third quarter, through September 22, fell to $539 billion from $699 billion in the previous quarter, according to Deals Intelligence.  Europe and Asia Pacific have been hit particularly hard, with deals in each region falling 34 percent from the previous quarter.  Parker fingered the lack of financing for deals involving noninvestment-grade companies as a significant cause of the drag.  “A number of deals have gone sideways,” he said, “but I’d expect many of those situations to be resurrected when the markets rebound.”  Investment-grade companies have had more luck, bankers said, but even they have bumped up against tighter lending as banks fret over the effects of the European debt crisis, according to one senior energy investment banker.  Joseph Frumkin, managing partner of Sullivan & Cromwell’s mergers & acquisitions group, said lead lenders who sell part of their loan commitments to other banks have become increasingly edgy.  “As the U.S. banks form syndicates, you can see concerns about European banks participating in syndicates,” the lawyer said. “What if they don’t make good on their commitments?”  One bright spot for bankers is that the size of deals announced in the quarter increased to an average of $155.9 million, the second-highest level in the last three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Big deals generate big fees, which has Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and other bankers celebrating. Goldman, the top global M&A adviser this year, shepherded shale gas producer Petrohawk Energy in its $12.1 billion sale to BHP Billiton. (BHP.AX) (BLT.L)  JPMorgan was one of the advisers to Medco Health Services Inc MHS.N on its $29.1 billion planned sale to Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX.O)  Large companies with strong reserves of cash will continue to be aggressive, in spite of the current uncertainty, bankers insist.  “In volatile markets like the ones we are experiencing, we are advising our clients to be well-prepared in order to be in a position to move decisively when market windows open,” said Jake Donavan, JPMorgan’s head of corporates and client coverage for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Even bankers’ optimism has limits, however. After starting with a bang, deal volume for 2011 is on track to end only 5 to 10 percent higher than last year, Parker estimated. That points to a dreadful fourth quarter since deal value is currently about 20 percent up from last year.  Scott Matlock, Morgan Stanley’s (MS.N) London-based chairman of international M&A said that the themes that drove healthier dealmaking last year — strong cash balances and available financing — are still present.  “Uncertainty about the global economy is the swing factor that could impact the next few quarters,” he said.

103,UTX,RPT-DEALS-JPMorgan takes top spot in U.S. league tables," (Repeats story from late on Thursday)   * JPM No. 1 in U.S., No. 2 worldwide in league tables   * Plans selective hires in tech, M&A defense   * Eyes aggressive expansion in middle-market deals   * JPM’s stability, banking capabilities help   By Paritosh Bansal   NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Chris Ventresca, JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM.N) co-head of North American M&A, still remembers the banker he worked for on his first deal as a young associate back in 1994.   It’s easy. The banker, Henry Harnischfeger, is still at JPMorgan and doing deals.   Such stability while many rivals have been walloped by crises, JP Morgan bankers said, has helped place their firm in the lead in the rankings of deal advisers this year.   “Keeping our focus on clients externally while others may have had more distractions or more volatility in terms of their people — that’s probably our greatest strength over the years,” said Ventresca, 45, a Princeton electrical engineer who started out at JPMorgan in 1988 as a computer programmer and never left.   The firm has jumped to the top spot in U.S. league tables from No. 5 last year, racing ahead of archrivals Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), according to Thomson Reuters data through Sept. 22.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    Take a Look on dealmaking               [ID:nS1E78L1U0]    Graphic showing global mergers and acquisitions:   r.reuters.com/kyb46q   Reuters Insider interview with Barclays’ Paul Parker:   link.reuters.com/wut83s   Reuters Insider show on boutique investment banks:   link.reuters.com/gat83s   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   JPMorgan has advised on $353.5 billion worth of deals involving U.S. companies so far this year, compared with about $295 billion each for Morgan Stanley and Goldman.   JPMorgan strengthened its position further late on Wednesday as United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) lead adviser on a $16.5 billion deal to buy Goodrich Corp GR.N. [ID:nS1E78L0BK]   The deal also helped the firm edge past Morgan Stanley to the No. 2 spot globally in league tables, the data shows.   In the United Technologies deal, the bank had a relationship with the company that goes back more than a decade.   Besides being the M&A adviser, JPMorgan is also the lead bank in a $15 billion financing for the deal and advised the company on other issues including selling shares and credit ratings.   “We surround these transactions,” said Jim Woolery, co-head of North American M&A. “We not only come at them from a strategic advisory and board perspective, but from a capital markets perspective as well.”   Still, competition for M&A business is fierce — Goldman is currently the No. 1 M&A bank globally.   League table fortunes are also fickle. At a time when deal activity is down, a few big deals can skew rankings from one year to the next.   Over the last few years, however, JPMorgan has firmly held on to a spot among the top three M&A advisers, data shows.   The bank received a further boost early this year, when a management reshuffle saw it bring on Woolery, 42, from the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore.   The reshuffle has led to initiatives such as greater focus on building board relationships at client firms as directors become more active after the financial crisis.   The bank is looking to hire selectively to boost its takeover defense and technology practices, as well as grow aggressively in the middle-market and emerging markets, the bankers said.   A big focus is tapping JPMorgan’s commercial bank relationships, they said.   Woolery said he and Ventresca spend a fair amount of time helping other divisions — such as capital markets, private banking and escrow — sell services as part of a JPMorgan culture to get people to work together.   “That comes back to us five-fold,” he said. “The M&A team doesn’t hide the ball from leveraged finance or FX; we work together as a team. A lot of people talk about that but actually executing on that is hard. It comes straight from the top here.”  (Reporting by Paritosh Bansal, editing by Matthew Lewis)   ",9232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/deals-jpmorgan/rpt-deals-jpmorgan-takes-top-spot-in-u-s-league-tables-idUSS1E78M03Y20110923

105,UTX,Analysis: 3-D printing making inroads in heavy manufacturing,"NISKAYUNA, New York (Reuters) - An old joke contends that a sculptor’s job is easy: To make a statue of an elephant, just take a block of stone and cut away everything that doesn’t look like an elephant.  A few major U.S. manufacturers, including General Electric Co (GE.N), are ready to try the opposite approach, building parts for heavy equipment from jet engines to ultrasound machines through a layer-by-layer process they call “additive manufacturing.”  The approach saves time, materials and money and could set the stage for performance breakthroughs as engineers find they can design components that previously would have been too complicated to mass manufacture.  Additive manufacturing, also called “3-D printing,” is not an entirely new technology. The technique has been around for two decades, but companies have primarily used it to quickly make prototypes of new products or to produce one-of-a-kind items like custom-fit hearing aids.  GE and its rivals including United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) are now adapting the technology to work in applications including jet engines, which require highly engineered metal parts able to stand up to extreme heat and pressure.  “The potential is huge from the standpoint of design flexibility,” said Todd Rockstroh, a consulting engineer at GE’s aviation arm, which is the world’s largest maker of jet engines. “You can literally design and manufacture things that are generally unmanufacturable today.  GE, the largest U.S. conglomerate, is working on the technology at its main research lab in Niskayuna, New York, outside Albany. There, engineers are using it to produce nozzles that will be used to spray fuel into jet engines through a process called “powder-bed manufacturing.”  It works by laying down a thin layer of powdered metal — cobalt chrome in this case — and running a beam of computer-controlled laser light over it, which heats the powder enough to weld it into the shape of the first layer of the nozzle. When that layer cools, more powder is laid down, the laser makes another pass and slowly builds the shape up to its full size — the nozzle itself is about the size of a very narrow computer mouse.  Additive manufacturing’s name highlights the contrast between the technique and traditional manufacturing, where many engineered parts start out as blocks of metal that machinists grind down into the shapes they need.  The new technique cuts costs by several thousand dollars on a roughly $4 million engine by Rockstroh’s estimate. It works in two ways, first turning what had been a complicated process of welding together 15 to 20 tiny parts into a two- to three-step procedure. Second, it saves raw material by not grinding away chips of metal that are not longer suited for use in jet engines.  The nozzles will be used in a jet engine GE plans to begin making in 2014.  Prabhjot Singh, the GE lab manager who has been working on the technique, said the main breakthrough was being sure the additive process could consistently produce parts that were dense enough to hold up inside a jet engine.  “The process was never this precise,” Singh said on a recent tour of his lab. “Sure you could make show-and-tells, but when you are talking about the aviation industry, these parts are safety-critical.”  Even advocates of the technology say that it will only be used in limited cases — GE will likely never produce an entire gas turbine in one pass, Singh said.  While saving labor and allowing engineers more freedom in their designs is part of the appeal of the additive approach, its advocates said that saving on raw materials costs is also a big part of the appeal, and with good reason.  Rising demand in rapidly industrializing China and India has driven metal prices sharply higher in the past few years. Copper and steel have more than doubled in price since early 2009 as measured by trading in their futures.  “Material is getting more expensive by the day,” said Tahany El-Wardany, principal engineer at United Tech.  The Hartford, Connecticut-based company uses the technology for making prototypes but does not yet believe it is ready for use in actual engines, said Agnes Klucha, an engineering manager at United Tech’s Pratt & Whitney division.  El-Wardany estimated the additive approach can cut a manufacturer’s raw material use on a given piece by 50 to 80 percent, depending on the design.  That sort of cost savings will eventual catch Wall Street’s eye, one analyst said.  “Every little bit helps toward lowering the overall costs of the product,” said Daniel Holland, an equity analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, who follows GE. “You’d expect the company to continue to evolve and figure out better ways of doing things such that they can save investors money and push the margin profile of the business a little higher.”  The hurdle is how effective it will prove in producing the huge volumes of parts that big manufacturers need.  “It’s this question of mass manufacturing, that’s the place where it will go,” said Michael Cima, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who patented one of the first 3-D printers in 1993. “When you get up into the millions of pieces, nobody has built the machine that will do that.”  ",9272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-manufacturing-additive/analysis-3-d-printing-making-inroads-in-heavy-manufacturing-idUSTRE78Q2LE20110927

111,UTX,"Ingersoll Rand cuts profit view, shares tumble","(Reuters) - Ingersoll Rand Plc (IR.N) cut its profit forecast for the rest of the year on Friday, blaming weak demand in North America for residential heating and cooling systems and commercial security products.  The warning sent shares of the U.S. maker of air conditioners and locks down as much as 18 percent to their lowest level in more than two years, and came as Wall Street is getting nervous that corporate profit growth may be slowing.  Analysts, on average, look for the companies that make up the widely watched Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX to report 13.5 percent earnings growth in the third quarter, down from an average forecast of 17 percent as of July 1.  “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know that residential markets were not going to be doing anything substantial for a company’s results,” said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Longbow Research. “This (Ingersoll forecast) is a warning sign, to show you that improving profits and beating guidance is not going to be easy for a while.”  Electric products maker Cooper Industries Plc CBE.N also cited weak demand for products used in residential and commercial buildings when it cut its third-quarter forecast earlier this month.  Ingersoll’s troubles are twofold: The second-half recovery in consumer demand for air conditioning and security systems that it expected has not materialized, and consumers who have replaced air conditioners or heaters have opted for lower-priced units, rather than the more profitable, and more expensive, high-efficiency systems, analysts said.  The Ingersoll cut could be the start of a wave of earnings warnings in the industrial sector, which is grappling with weak demand in the United States and Europe, one analyst said.  “My feeling is this is the first of many in the industrial space in the next couple of weeks,” said Eric Landry, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.  Ingersoll, which is headquartered in Davidson, North Carolina, but incorporated in Dublin, generates 67 percent of its revenue in North America. That makes it more reliant on its home market than bigger U.S. industrials, including General Electric Co (GE.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which have used growth in Asia and the Middle East to offset sluggish U.S. spending.  Ingersoll shares were down $4.21, or 13 percent, at $27.75 in early-afternoon trading, the sharpest decline on the New York Stock Exchange. They touched a low of $26.13 earlier in the session. The earlier low marked Ingersoll’s biggest one-day drop since the 1987 “Black Monday” stock market crash.  The Standard & Poor’s capital-goods industry index .GSPIC was down 1.9 percent, and U.S. stocks were broadly lower as investors worried the global economy is slowing.  Ingersoll, which makes Schlage locks and Trane air conditioners, cut its third-quarter profit forecast to a range of 77 cents to 80 cents per share. At its midpoint, that is down 12.8 percent from the company’s prior forecast and would represent a decline from 80 cents per share in the year-earlier third quarter.  Analysts were expecting the company to post a profit of 91 cents a share for the quarter before special items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  For the year, Ingersoll now expects earnings of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. At its midpoint, that is down 8 percent from prior guidance and below the $2.96 per share Wall Street had looked for.  The Ingersoll warning did not catch investors entirely unawares. Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan earlier this month cut his third-quarter forecasts on a range of big industrials, including Ingersoll, GE, SPX Corp SPW.N and 3M Co (MMM.N), warning that he expected forecast cuts.

115,UTX,Investors to manufacturers: what about next year?,"BOSTON (Reuters) - “Forget about where you’ve been. Tell us where you’re going.” That’s the message from investors to big U.S. manufacturers ahead of a wave of earnings reports over the next few weeks. They will be far less interested in hearing how the third quarter went than what companies expect next year to be like and how they are preparing for it. While early earnings reports from big companies including Alcoa Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co disappointed investors, analysts are still expecting the industrial sector to chalk up solid third-quarter profit growth of 15.2 percent across the sector, above the 12.5 percent forecast for the full Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Chief executives are likely to push back on questions about their 2012 outlooks — big companies including General Electric Co, United Technologies Corp and Honeywell International Inc typically wait until December to discuss their forecast for the next year. But some investors say the European debt crisis and signs of slowing demand will make them eager for an earlier update. The memory of the sharp downturn following the late 2008 credit crunch is still fresh in their minds. “Are managements going to retrench as quickly and as deeply in the event of a credit moment in Europe or China as they did last time around?” said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland, Ohio. “What we want to hear is a dose of reality. What are you planning, what’s your contingency, what are you actually seeing?” This comes as CEOs of many big U.S. companies say orders are holding up, and one of the main risks they see is that customers will start holding off on orders out of fear that something might happen to hurt the economy. “There is just not enough certainty and in some ways the most important thing we can do right now is social and it has to do with rebuilding confidence,” GE CEO Jeff Immelt told a group of executives from mid-sized U.S. companies in Columbus, Ohio last week. Immelt is due to speak at a Thomson Reuters Newsmaker event in New York on Monday. Heading into the reporting season, not every company has offered a positive view of how the third quarter went. Ingersoll Rand Plc fired a warning shot, saying that profit could be down for the quarter, as demand for heating and cooling equipment that it had earlier expected in North America failed to materialize. But Honeywell confirmed its outlook, saying it expected to come in at the high end of its forecast on strong demand for turbochargers and automation and control equipment. Several factors are working in big manufacturers’ favor: One is that the price of a wide range of metals have fallen, easing pressure on profit margins. The price of copper, particularly important as it used for all sorts of wiring, fell by 25 percent in the third quarter. Another is that many big industrials, including GE, United Technologies and ITT Corp now generate a significant portion of their revenue from maintenance of the products they sell, and that business tends to hold up even when new-equipment sales fall. But the risks are also clear. With growth at home sagging, U.S. multinationals have been counting on foreign demand to drive results.

The base business we’re still targeting at 10 percent earnings growth for next year.” The world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners is stepping up its restructuring spending, allocating more than $300 million to ways to cut costs this year, up from its previous plan to spend $200 million on restructuring, he said. The company may cut jobs at its Pratt & Whitney jet engine and Sikorsky helicopter units, as they feel the pinch of lower military spending on aircraft. That move — to cut costs in the face of uncertainty — may become a common one among big U.S. companies, investors and observers have said. “No one knows anything. You don’t know what the policy environment is going to be, you don’t know what the international environment is going to be and you don’t know what the tax environment is going to be. But you do know what your costs are,” said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland, Ohio. “So you control what you have in front of your nose.” Major U.S. industrials including United Tech, as well as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) cut tens of thousands of jobs in the wake of the 2007-2009 recession. Since then they have counted on low costs and a large presence in fast-growing markets including China, Brazil and Russia to offset tepid demand in the United States and Europe.

THIRD-QUARTER BEATS United Tech’s third-quarter profit rose 10.5 percent, topping analysts’ expectations. It raised its full-year forecast for the fourth time since its initial December forecast. It expects to earn $5.47 per share in 2011, representing a 15 percent rise over 2010. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company is counting on strong orders from China, which were up 30 percent in the quarter, and the continuing revenues it makes from maintaining the equipment it sells, to help it hit that target. It also plans to close its biggest-ever acquisition, a $16.5 billion deal for Goodrich Corp GR.N, next year. Textron, the world’s largest maker of corporate jets, also beat Wall Street’s forecasts for the just-ended quarter. It reported net income of $142 million, or 47 cents per share, reversing a year-earlier loss. Factoring out one-time items, profit came to 45 cents per share, well ahead of the 31 cents per share analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Providence, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings to come to $1.05 to $1.15 per share. Factoring out costs related to a recent debt buyback, that forecast is unchanged from its view three months earlier, Chief Executive Scott Donnelly told investors on a conference call. Donnelly, a former GE executive, has made cutting costs a priority since taking the helm in 2009. He declined to forecast 2012 performance, but noted that demand for Cessna light jets would be affected by the uncertain economic outlook, though he said the unit was continuing to book orders, particularly in Latin America and Asia. Amphenol Corp (APH.N), a maker of electronic and fiber optics connectors, cut its full-year sales and profit targets citing uncertainty around fiscal and budget issues in developed economies. “We have begun to see increased levels of caution from many of our customers, translating into lower demand in most markets,” the Wallingford, Connecticut-based company said. Another reason for caution came from a widely-tracked annual forecast of U.S. construction activity. New U.S. construction starts are forecast to rise only slightly in 2012, to $412 billion from 2011’s $410 billion, according to McGraw-Hill Construction. McGraw-Hill said 9.1 percent unemployment and tight budgets at the state and local level remain impediments to new building activity, which has remained depressed for three years. United Tech shares were up 12 cents at $74.24 and Textron was up 35 cents at $19.01 on the New York Stock Exchange.

120,UTX,"Caterpillar masters slowdown, posts record results","(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc muscled through murky economic conditions with a surprising 44 percent jump in quarterly profit, and forecast strong demand through next year in a sign of optimism for the global economy. The company said on Monday that it expects full-year 2011 profit and revenue to set records on the back of surging sales for mining equipment and construction machinery in most markets around the world — suggesting the underlying health of the global economy may not be as dire as is widely believed. Caterpillar executives expect that momentum to carry into next year, with sales rising up to 20 percent above the expected record $58 billion in sales in this year. “We’re having a great year in 2011, and 2012 is shaping up to be better,” said Caterpillar Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman. Stronger demand at the world’s largest heavy machinery manufacturer means more jobs and investment. Caterpillar said it hired nearly 5,000 people in the quarter. The company typically breaks out its employment figures on a year-over-year basis, but this time it detailed the improvement from second quarter to third quarter. The comparison showed that Caterpillar is coupling earnings growth with a steady commitment to hiring. “To the degree that we see continuing increases in demand for our products, it will lead to additional hiring,” Chief Financial Officer Ed Rapp said in an interview. Caterpillar’s production should continue to rise in the months to come. The bullish news from the world’s largest heavy machinery manufacturer, which follows strong forecasts from the likes of General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp, helped spark an overall rally in the market Monday. The stock gained about 5.5 percent, or $4.77, to $92.16 on the New York Stock Exchange, and accounted for a third of the 125-point gain seen Monday in the Dow Jones industrial average. “When a big-name company like this reports numbers like these, that will help turn around talk about another recession,” said Andrew Bodner, president of Double Diamond Investment Group in Parsippany, New Jersey. “Record (third quarter) sales and profit results were particularly impressive to us in light of economic challenges in developed nations,” Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Michael Jaffe said. “Caterpillar’s current trends also lead us to expect ongoing demand growth in 2012.” CFO Rapp said the current environment “looks very dissimilar to 2008,” when the economy last fell into recession. He said that Caterpillar’s finance arm is able to readily fund purchases of machinery, and he said dealers — many of whom panicked with recession on the horizon a few years ago — are showing considerable optimism. “It’s just not as bad as people want to make it out to be,” Rapp said. Caterpillar said it ended the third quarter in one of the healthiest positions in its recent history, with backlog orders standing at record levels and higher commodity prices leading to a favorable environment for its growing mining business, which is performing well in a variety of markets in all regions of the world. “Although there is a good deal of economic and political uncertainty in the world, we are not seeing it much in our business at this point,” CEO Oberhelman said. “We believe continued economic recovery, albeit a slow recovery, is the most likely scenario as we move forward.” PENT-UP DEMAND The construction industry — influenced by housing, commercial expansion and infrastructure development — is currently a tale of two sectors. Emerging economies are scrambling to buy enough new equipment to keep up with booming demand. But in mature markets, where construction spending is well below historic trends, customers are simply buying equipment to replace aging machinery. The company did caution that it is seeing a bit of a slowdown in China’s demand levels due to measures the government is taking to tighten the economy. Caterpillar executives, speaking during a conference call with investors, said the slowdown is needed and indicated the company continues to build share in that market. Rapp said Caterpillar is optimistic about ongoing policy discussions in the U.S. as well. The company expects a glut of “pent-up demand” for new construction to eventually spark new growth in more mature markets. Caterpillar’s forecast outlook indicates the company is successfully “coming to grips with a slower global economy,” Longbow Research equity analyst Eli Lustgarten said. Caterpillar is able to succeed in the cloudy environment due to “very big growth outside of the United States and what’s been a very strong (machinery) replenishment rate in the U.S.,” he said. Caterpillar reported third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.14 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with $792 million, or $1.22 per share, a year before. Analysts on average had expected Caterpillar to earn $1.54 per share in the third quarter. Sales rose 41 percent to $15.7 billion, which is a record, according to the company. Caterpillar earned $1.93 per share on $14.58 billion in sales excluding the impact of the acquisition of the Bucyrus mining business earlier this year. It now expects annual sales of $58 billion, including the impact of its acquisition of Bucyrus, in 2011. Its previous forecast had been a range of $56 billion to $58 billion. Profit is now expected to be $6.75 per share for the year, compared with a prior forecast of $6.25 to $6.75. Including the impact of Bucyrus, Caterpillar expects 2011 profit to reach $7.25 per share.

Stoll Oct 24 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc is expected to report a 26 percent increase in quarterly earnings per share on Monday, fueled by the strength of mining and infrastructure businesses. The world’s largest heavy machinery manufacturer will also give 2012 revenue expectations, likely to be strong as replacement demand for heavy machinery continues heating up. Analysts expect Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar to post a third-quarter profit of $1.54 per share, excluding one-time items, on $15.03 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That compares with earnings per share of $1.22 in the same period a year ago. Key players in the U.S. industrials sector have recently coupled strong earnings reports with optimistic outlooks for the near term prospects of their business. Still, executives remain concerned about the state of the wider economy. Last week, United Technologies Corp beat analysts’ forecasts and said it expects profit to rise about 10 percent next year.General Electric Co , meanwhile, met Wall Street estimates, but its shares fell 1.9 percent on Friday as investors worried about declining profit margins. Analysts will keep a close eye on whether slower growth in key emerging markets, such as China, hit Caterpillar in the quarter. Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten said that Caterpillar rival Komatsurecently cited slower economic growth in certain emerging markets as a headwind. “There is a wide anticipation that Asia is somewhat soft.” For full-year 2011, Caterpillar has guided toward revenue in the $54 billion to $56 billion range, and profit in the range of $6.75 to $7.00 per share. This excludes the company’s recent acquisition of mining company Bucyrus International, which is expected to add about $2 billion in revenue in 2011 and provide a modest dent to earnings due to deal costs. Shares of Caterpillar showed strength ahead of the company’s Monday earnings report, with the stock trading up 3.7 percent to close at $87.39 on Friday. Wall Street is likely more concerned about the 2012 outlook than how the company fared last quarter, Lustgarten said. Caterpillar’s performance in 2012 has been a focal point since the company predicted in 2009 — during the depths of the U.S. recession and financial crisis — that its revenue would, by 2012, climb to the $55 billion to $60 billion range, with profit in the $8 to $10-per-share range. Analysts currently expect Caterpillar 2012 revenue to far exceed that target, reaching nearly $66 billion — which represents a 16 percent increase compared with estimates for 2011. That number does not include the impact of Bucyrus. Lustgarten said one reason 2012 is expected to be strong is because of widespread demand for replacement machinery following the decline in demand that started in late last decade. Still, analysts have concerns. In a recent note, Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck said rapid volume increases “could hamper (its) suppliers’ ability to keep up with Caterpillar’s needs.” Also, Fleck said integrating recently acquired firms, such as locomotive manufacturer EMD and engine maker MWM, “presents a critical near-term risk.”",10242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/caterpillar/caterpillar-profit-outlook-expected-to-be-robust-idUSN1E79K1DM20111024

123,UTX,United Tech sees 2012 profit up as much as 10 percent,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) said on Thursday it expected to increase profits by 6 to 10 percent in 2012, despite a slowing U.S. recovery and what it expects to be a prolonged slump in Europe. In a nod to deteriorating conditions, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners forecast revenue growth of 1.7 to 3.4 percent at its core businesses. The profit and revenue forecasts omitted the costs and revenue of the company’s pending $16.5 billion deal for Goodrich Corp GR.N, its biggest-ever acquisition, which it expects to close in the middle of the year. The company, which also makes Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, is planning for several years of slow growth in Europe, Chief Executive Louis Chenevert told reporters after a meeting with analysts. “Obviously we follow the situation in Europe very closely and we will adjust proactively according to what we see the market’s going to do,” Chenevert said. “I don’t expect at this point in time that we will see a recession (In Europe) but I expect a tough couple of years of pretty soft market.” That stands in contrast to his peers at Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) who told investors earlier on Thursday that they do expect the European economy to slip into recession in the first half of 2012. The company is considering selling some smaller pieces of its diverse portfolio to avoid selling stock to help fund the Goodrich buy. “It’s a reassessment of the portfolio ...…there’s UTC core, which is aerospace, commercial (building products) and then looking at the portfolio, there’s a lot of other pieces that I think will be under review and then we’ll make the decision,” Chenevert said. “I hate equity issuance.” The Hartford, Connecticut-based company, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters, forecast 2012 earnings of about $5.80 to $6 per share, excluding the Goodrich deal. Analysts had expected $5.90 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Our EPS growth outlook for the base business is 10 percent,” Chenevert said. Overall, the Goodrich deal will represent a 50 cent per share drag on earnings next year, reflecting deal costs and the company’s suspension of share buybacks, and could leave net income down as much as 3 percent. United Tech forecast 2012 sales of about $64 billion, including acquired Goodrich revenue, or $59 billion to $60 billion from its base business. The company forecast the strongest sales growth at its Hamilton Sundstrand aircraft electronics unit, which it expects to grow about 10 percent, and the weakest at Sikorsky helicopters, which it forecast down by mid-single-digit percentages. The forecast was roughly in line with other 2012 profit forecasts that its fellow diversified manufacturers released this week. General Electric Co (GE.N) estimated “double digit” profit growth, Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) called for growth of up to 12 percent and Danaher Corp (DHR.N) forecast 15 to 20 percent growth. Since United Tech announced third quarter results in mid-October, order trends and foreign exchange were about in line with expectations, taxes were more favorable, and the company’s fire and security business was weaker than expected, Chenevert said. Foreign exchange and pension costs will likely be challenges next year, the CEO said, but predicting the value of the euro was “almost impossible.” ",12162011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-unitedtech-outlook/united-tech-sees-2012-profit-up-as-much-as-10-percent-idUSTRE7BE2EL20111216
124,UTX,Analysis: United Tech CEO sharpens portfolio-pruning shears,"BOSTON (Reuters) - As United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) gets ready to close the biggest takeover in its history, Goodrich Corp GR.N, CEO Louis Chenevert is scouring the diversified manufacturer’s portfolio for businesses to sell. The world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners has identified businesses that generate about $1.5 billion in collective annual revenue — about 2.5 percent of the company — as possible sale targets, with most of the candidates in the company’s fire and security products division, analysts said. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters, is likely to close at least some of the sales before it completes its $16.5 billion takeover of aerospace components maker Goodrich in mid-2012. The goal is to minimize the up to $4.6 billion in new shares it said it could issue to fund the Goodrich purchase. “I have never, ever seen this degree of urgency,” said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co that follows the company. “All of the senior managers are riding with the spurs on the horse the whole time. They are not walking the horse.” Chenevert, who has served as chief executive of the company since 2008, telegraphed his intentions at a meeting with investors in New York last week. “I hate equity issuance,” Chenevert said. Analysts said they would welcome any efforts to help the company, with a $65.59 billion market value, avoid selling additional shares. United Tech this year also bought out its former partner Rolls-Royce Plc’s (RR.L) stake in a joint venture that makes jet engines for $1.5 billion. “If you have an underperforming business that you can sell, wouldn’t you rather sell that than sell a piece of the whole company?” said Daniel Holland, an analyst at Morningstar. The company is doing a “reassessment of the portfolio,” Chenevert told reporters on Thursday. “There’s UTC core, which is aerospace, which is commercial (building products) and then, looking at the portfolio, there’s a lot of other pieces that I think will be under review,” Chenevert said. He declined to name any specific businesses the company would consider selling, but cited the private security-guard operations that United Tech had acquired as it built up its fire and security equipment business — most of which it has sold — as examples of the sort of labor-intensive business he did not want to be in. “If a lot of humans are involved and it’s labor-intensive, then they don’t want to be in the business,” said analyst Brian Langenberg, of Langenberg & Co. “There’s about $1.5 billion in business that doesn’t need to be in the portfolio.” Analysts said they expect most of the focus to be on the company’s fire and security business. That unit made a series of more than 40 acquisitions from 2006 through early this year under the leadership of William Brown, who in October left United Tech to become CEO of Harris Corp (HRS.N), a maker of telecommunications equipment. That spate of deals includes the $1.8 billion deal for General Electric Co (GE.N)’s security arm that Chenevert holds up as an example of an idealized takeover for his company. “Whenever a guy who rolls everything up into a business goes out the door, there’s an opportunity to re-look at things,” said Heymann, of William Blair. The fire and security unit still has a handful of labor-intensive operations, including a security guard business in Macau and remote video and phone monitoring operations in the United Kingdom and Australia. Another analyst suggested that the company’s Clipper Windpower unit, which United Tech bought out last year, could be a sale candidate. The company had taken a minority stake in the wind turbine manufacturer but wound up buying the Carpenteria, California-based company outright after Clipper faced a cash crunch and turned to United Tech for a loan. “The Clipper Wind acquisition, that strikes me as a piece that is not necessarily core to United Technologies, that they should be able to part with pretty easily and just generate cash,” said Morningstar’s Holland. A United Tech spokesman declined to elaborate on Chenevert’s Thursday comments.

126,UTX,United Tech weighs $3.5 billion sale of Hamilton units: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is reviewing the possibility of selling its flow and compressor businesses that could fetch a combined $3.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said. A sale of these businesses, which are part of United Tech’s Hamilton Sundstrand unit, would help the company minimize the amount of shares it needs to sell to fund its largest-ever acquisition — its planned purchase of Goodrich Corp GR.N for $16.5 billion. United Tech had initially planned to raise up to $4.6 billion in new shares to fund that deal. The company has been adamant about not selling any more stock than it has to for the Goodrich takeover and also intends to keep its credit rating. United Tech currently has an “A” credit rating from Standard & Poor’s — not top shelf, but solidly investment-grade. Last month, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said the company could announce plans in March to sell some of its fire and security unit’s installation businesses to raise money. Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), which is acting as United Tech’s financial adviser, has reached out to a number of potential strategic buyers and private equity firms to gauge their interest in buying the flow and compressor businesses, the sources said. These discussions are however at a preliminary stage, and the company could eventually decide against selling these businesses. United Tech and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. United Tech’s Hamilton Sundstrand unit makes fluid control products and pumps under the Milton Roy and Sundyne brands. It also manufactures air compressors under the Sullair brand. The flow and compressor businesses could be broken up and sold to different buyers, according to the sources.

127,UTX,United Tech weighs $3.5 bln sale of Hamilton units-sources,"* Review to raise money to fund Goodrich purchase * Goldman approached potential strategic, PE buyers -sources * Flow, compressor units worth $3.5 bln, may sell in pieces By Greg Roumeliotis and Soyoung Kim NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp is reviewing the possibility of selling its flow and compressor businesses that could fetch a combined $3.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said. A sale of these businesses, which are part of United Tech’s Hamilton Sundstrand unit, would help the company minimize the amount of shares it needs to sell to fund its largest-ever acquisition — its planned purchase of Goodrich Corp for $16.5 billion. United Tech had initially planned to raise up to $4.6 billion in new shares to fund that deal. The company has been adamant about not selling any more stock than it has to for the Goodrich takeover and also intends to keep its credit rating. United Tech currently has an “A” credit rating from Standard & Poor’s — not top shelf, but solidly investment-grade. Last month, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said the company could announce plans in March to sell some of its fire and security unit’s installation businesses to raise money. Goldman Sachs Group, which is acting as United Tech’s financial adviser, has reached out to a number of potential strategic buyers and private equity firms to gauge their interest in buying the flow and compressor businesses, the sources said. These discussions are however at a preliminary stage, and the company could eventually decide against selling these businesses. United Tech and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. United Tech’s Hamilton Sundstrand unit makes fluid control products and pumps under the Milton Roy and Sundyne brands. It also manufactures air compressors under the Sullair brand. The flow and compressor businesses could be broken up and sold to different buyers, according to the sources. The sources who are familiar with the industry said the logical universe of buyers could include companies such as SPX Corp, Flowserve Corp, Dover Corp, Weir Group PLC, Sulzer AG, Pentair Inc and Tyco International. Atlas Copco AB, Gardner Denver Inc and Engel could be the natural strategic buyers for the compressor business, the sources said.

133,UTX,UPDATE 2-Moody's says deal hurts United Tech credit outlook,"* Moody’s lowers ratings outlook to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’ * Cites reluctance to sell shares to fund Goodrich deal * Affirms ‘A2’ senior unsecured credit rating * Ratings key to access commercial paper market By Scott Malone Feb 28 (Reuters) - Moody’s Investors Service cut the outlook for credit ratings on United Technologies Corp  to “negative” from “stable,” citing a reluctance by the company to sell shares to fund its pending takeover of Goodrich Corp . Even as it changed its outlook, the ratings agency on Tuesday affirmed its “A2” senior unsecured credit rating on the diversified U.S. manufacturer. United Tech aims to close its $16.5 billion takeover of Goodrich — the largest deal in its history — later this year. When the deal was announced last fall, management said it could issue up to $4.6 billion in shares to fund the acquisition. But Chief Executive Louis Chenevert has since said he would look to sell small pieces of the company to avoid selling stock. Selling additional shares would dilute the value of the outstanding stock of the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners and effectively lower its per-share earnings, a figure closely tracked by investors. “The quick reversal and shift in equity consideration is ... noteworthy, particularly in consideration of the fiscal conservatism that has historically been demonstrated on a relatively consistent basis by the company,” Moody’s said in a press release. Moody’s noted that United Tech’s debt would approach three times its earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization when the deal closes. It said it may lower its ratings on United Tech unless it expects debt to fall to two times EBITDA, with the company meeting some other financial targets, by early 2014. It said the Goodrich deal itself looked strategically sound. United Tech spokesman John Moran declined to comment. The company’s shares were down 27 cents at $83.36 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Chenevert — who courted his Goodrich counterpart Marshall Larsen for more than a year before inking the deal in September — has repeatedly told investors that he would “hate” to issue any more stock than necessary to pay for the maker of aircraft components. “I hate equity issuance,” Chenevert told an investor meeting last week. “There’s a clear path at this point in time to have equity be probably $2 billion or less.” Chenevert’s key strategy to lower the number of shares sold is selling off small portions of the company. United Tech executives have said they are reviewing their fire and security business for potential sales, and sources said earlier this month the company was considering selling the flow and compressor components of its Hamilton Sundstrand arm, which could be worth $3.5 billion. United Tech intends to unveil its sale plans at a meeting with investors in New York next month. Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes told Reuters in January that the Hartford, Connecticut-based company was keen to avoid any cuts to its credit rating as a result of the Goodrich deal. “In these kind of crazy times in the credit market, the last thing I want to do is lose my credit rating,” Hayes said. “It’s not because a downgrade costs me a lot in terms of additional interest expense, it’s really because it costs me access to the commercial paper market, which we’re in every day.” The commercial paper market — where companies borrow cash for very short periods of time to cover operating expenses — briefly froze up in the fall of 2008, an event that threatened the finances of big U.S. companies, including United Tech’s larger peer General Electric Co. Moody’s affirmed its top-notch “P-1” short-term credit rating on United Tech.",2282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/unitedtech-rating/update-2-moodys-says-deal-hurts-united-tech-credit-outlook-idUSL2E8DS8HJ20120228

137,UTX,United Tech to sell units to fund Goodrich deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) aims to sell three small units to raise about $3 billion in cash that the diversified U.S. manufacturer said would allow it to avoid issuing new common shares immediately to fund its largest-ever acquisition. The world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners is putting its Rocketdyne and Clipper Windpower and some of its Hamilton Sundstrand industrial businesses on the block, hoping to sell them by the end of the year and to use another $3 billion from its balance sheet to help pay for Goodrich Corp GR.N. “We had contemplated not using any cash for this deal,” Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said at a meeting with analysts and investors. But when the company in September revealed its plans to sell up to $4.6 billion in shares to fund the $16.5 billion takeover, “nobody liked” the idea, he added. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company plans to issue $2 billion to $3 billion in short-term debt, $6 billion to $7 billion in long-term debt and $1.5 billion in convertible notes in the acquisition. The company believes the current low-interest rate environment makes this an opportune time to sell the units, which collectively generated $2.4 billion in 2011 revenue. “If you’re ever going to sell that business, now is the time,” Chief Executive Louis Chenevert told reporters after the meeting. “If the deal doesn’t come together where it’s basically a high price, we’re going to keep the business.” United Tech expects to sign contracts to sell the three units by July, but does not expect to close the sales before completing its Goodrich purchase in the second quarter. Taking on some debt to prevent diluting the shares may be a safe bet for investors, said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland, Ohio. “If you can get that debt on the books when interest rates are at what look like historic lows, that ought to get paid off pretty quickly,” Klein said. “I don’t think it’s going to be a big issue for them.” Several executives repeated the company’s recent warnings that the first quarter had been tough, with Chinese orders for building systems like elevators below expectations. Among them was Otis President Pedro Baranda, who confirmed the unit’s full-year growth forecast, but added: “We see more risk to this guidance today than we did in December ... We expect the second half of the year to be better.” Those warnings have prompted analysts to lower their per-share profit forecast for the quarter. Wall Street now looks for earnings of about $1.18 per share, down from a $1.25 forecast at the end of December, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Factoring out one-time items such as an expected tax benefit, first-quarter profit will be roughly flat with the prior-year level, Hayes said. Including Goodrich and factoring out the units now up for sale, United Tech expects 2012 earnings per share to come in at $5.30 to $5.50, flat to up 4 percent from 2011, with revenue up about 10 percent to a range of $61 billion to $62 billion. By contrast, fellow industrial General Electric Co (GE.N) looks for “double-digit” profit growth this year and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) forecasts a 5 to 11 percent rise in per-share earnings. Shares of United Tech, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners, closed up 8 cents at $86.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. United Tech expects to pay less than a 2.7 percent combined interest rate on that debt, Hayes said. “We’ll deleverage quickly,” Hayes said. “We’ll get back to a solid rating by 2014.” United Tech was less than enthusiastic about one of the businesses it plans to divest - Clipper, which it bought out in 2010 after first taking a minority investment and then seeing it run into a cash crunch. “We all make mistakes,” Hayes said of that deal. Rocketdyne makes engines for rockets used in satellite launches, Clipper Windpower makes wind turbines and the Hamilton Sundstrand units make pumps and other industrial components. Determining how many shares to issue has been a balancing act for United Tech. Chenevert in December said he hates issuing new shares, in no small part because doing so reduces the per-share earnings figures that Wall Street watches closely. At the same time, if the company pays out too much of its cash or took on too much debt to fund the deal, it could imperil its credit rating. Moody’s Investors Service last month cut its outlook on United Tech’s “A2” debt rating to “negative” from “stable,” citing its reluctance to sell shares. Keeping a high rating is important because United Tech needs daily access to the commercial paper market, where companies borrow cash for short periods of time to cover operating expenses, Hayes previously said. United Tech has historically made a steady stream of small acquisitions, but plans in the future to focus on deals of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, in part because doing fewer, larger deals encourages better management focus on them, Chenevert said. “If you do a transaction of $100 million or $500 million dollars, it does not move the needle,” Chenevert said. “If you do a transaction of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, it starts to move the needle for the company.” ",3152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-unitedtech-deals/united-tech-to-sell-units-to-fund-goodrich-deal-idUSBRE82E0Z520120315

141,UTX,"United Tech on wind unit: ""We all make mistakes""","NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - “We all make mistakes.” That was United Technologies Corp Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes’ assessment of Clipper Windpower. The diversified U.S. manufacturer, which bought the wind turbine maker in 2010, said on Thursday that it would try to sell it to raise money to fund its takeover of aerospace supplier Goodrich Corp. “We bought into this business with a thought that there was going to be a renewable energy mandate in this country, and there has not been one,” Hayes told an investor meeting in New York. “The market, as everyone knows, is stagnating.” Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech bought a minority stake in Clipper in early 2010, intending to slowly explore its options in the wind turbine market. But Clipper ran into a cash crunch later that year. United Tech wound up buying out the rest of the company that it did not already own, on the rationale that this was a safer move than lending money to a company that faced hefty competitors including General Electric Co, Siemens AG and Vestas. United Tech concluded that it would have to make significant new capital investments in Clipper’s manufacturing operations to make the large-scale turbines in demand today and that it would rather invest that money in its core businesses, which make aerospace equipment and systems for large commercial buildings, Hayes said.",3152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/unitedtech-mistakes/united-tech-on-wind-unit-we-all-make-mistakes-idUSL2E8EF7LV20120315

United Tech unveiled its biggest-ever takeover in September. The deal would reinforce its presence in the civilian aerospace market. Goodrich parts are used on aircraft including Boeing Co’s 787 Dreamliner and Airbus’ A320neo. The European Commission said on Tuesday it had opened an in-depth investigation after an initial assessment showed potential competition issues in the markets for engine controls and AC power generators, due to the companies’ very high combined market share. “The aviation equipment industry is already concentrated and is characterized by high barriers to entry,” EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said in a statement. “We need to make sure that competition is preserved and incentives to innovate remain. We must also prevent a rise in input prices for aircraft and engine manufacturers as well as other aviation equipment suppliers,” he said. The Commission said it will decide by August 9 whether to clear or block the deal. United Tech Chief Executive Louis Chenevert earlier this month told reporters the company expected the review by the Commission to be a “substantial process.” A spokeswoman for United Tech, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, said on Tuesday the company had expected the move. “The phase II in the EU is not surprising; it is part of the normal regulatory review process,” said United Tech spokeswoman Maureen Fitzgerald. “We continue to work with the EU and other regulatory authorities and continue to expect a mid-year closing.” Goodrich declined to comment. One analyst said he did not see any major risks in the regulatory investigation. “It’s a formality that has a potential to push out the proposed close date.

It has occasionally agreed to licensing deals instead. Shares of both companies were little changed following the announcement. United Tech was down 19 cents at $83.31 and Goodrich was off 6 cents at $124.89, both on the New York Stock Exchange. The EU watchdog said it was also concerned that the removal of Goodrich as an independent supplier of fuel nozzles and engine controls could lead to higher input prices for engine makers competing with United Tech’s engine subsidiary Pratt & Whitney.

158,UTX,"TPG, Carlyle eye bids for $3.5-billion-plus United arm","NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Private equity firms TPG Capital and Carlyle Group (CG.O) are separately considering bids for United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) industrial units that make pumps and compressors valued at $3.5 billion to $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The sale is one of three that the diversified U.S. manufacturer is trying to close to raise cash and avoid issuing new common shares to fund its largest-ever acquisition, the $16.5 billion purchase of Goodrich Corp GR.N. TPG and Carlyle are each interested in buying the businesses — part of United Tech’s Hamilton Sundstrand arm — as a whole. This could make them serious contenders in the race, as rival company bidders are interested in buying either pumps or compressors but not necessarily both, the sources said. When United Tech initially put the industrial units on the block in March, along with its Rocketdyne space and Clipper Windpower operations, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes estimated that the sale of all three units could raise about $3 billion. “To the extent that you can have your buyers bidding up the price, it’s advantageous for the company that is selling the business,” said Daniel Holland, an analyst at Morningstar who follows the company. “For shareholders, it’s beneficial to have that number continue to go up,” he said on Tuesday. Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech decided to sell the three units after shareholders objected to an earlier plan to sell up to $4.6 billion in new common shares to fund the Goodrich deal. In March the company announced a different financing plan that eliminated any direct share issuance but included $1.5 billion in convertible notes. A substantial run-up in the bidding could allow United Tech to entirely avoid issuing convertible notes, though that is by no means a certainty, said one investor. “You’re seeing a creep-up (in bids) but not to the extent where that’s feasible yet,” said Oliver Pursche, president of ary Goldberg Financial Services, which holds United Tech shares. Bids would have to rise significantly for the company to avoid issuing convertible notes, he said on Tuesday. FlowServe Corp (FLS.N), Dover Corp (DOV.N) and Atlas Copco AB (ATCOa.ST) are among industrial companies that have been pursuing the pump business, while Gardner Denver Inc (GDI.N) has shown interest in the compressor business, the sources said. Reuters could not learn if any of these strategic buyers are keen to buy the entire industrial business. Atlas Copco, for example, is a major player in compressors but believes it could encounter anti-trust issues if it were to pursue the compressor business as well, a source close to the company said. Representatives for TPG, Carlyle and Atlas Copco declined to comment. United Tech, Dover, FlowServe and Gardner Denver had no immediate comment. United Tech, which is open to selling these units either as a whole or in parts, has held meetings with the interested parties in recent weeks after collecting initial bids in mid-April, according to the people familiar with the matter. The pump businesses for sale have roughly $200 million in estimated 2012 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and may go for as much as 12 times EBITDA, or $2.4 billion, some of the sources said. The compressor business has some $160 million in forward EBITDA and may be sold for 8-9 times EBITDA, they said. United Tech is expected to weigh the potential valuation gains from selling pumps and compressors to different buyers, versus the simplicity of a deal in selling all the units in one transaction, the sources said. United Tech’s Hamilton Sundstrand unit makes fluid control products and pumps under the Milton Roy and Sundyne brands. It also manufactures air compressors under the Sullair brand. Company officials have  said that talks to sell Rocketdyne, which makes rocket engines used in satellite launches have now focused on one prospective buyer and that United Tech expects to have a contract to sell the unit by the end of June. The European Union in March opened a review of the United Tech-Goodrich deal, citing concerns about the combined entities’ high market share. EU antitrust regulators are expected to announce their decision by August 9. Morningstar’s Holland said he has mixed views of the merit of the sale of the industrial unit: “It was a solid business for United Technologies, it was a good performer, had high margins. It’s the strongest of the three units that they’re selling. So it’s tough to watch that kind of profitability leave the portfolio. So it’s a mixed bag.” ",5152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-unitedtech-sale/tpg-carlyle-eye-bids-for-3-5-billion-plus-united-arm-idUSBRE84E16A20120515

163,UTX,UPDATE 1-United Tech says Goodrich deal to close in July,"* Confident in face of EU antitrust review * Says sale of Rocketdyne, industrial units on track By Scott Malone May 22 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp is confident that its $16.5 billion takeover of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp will close in July, despite a continuing European Union antitrust review of the deal. “We have good confidence ... that we will close by mid- to late July,” United Tech Chief Executive Louis Chenevert told an investor conference on Tuesday. “We have been working aggressively with the customers, with the agency, for antitrust approval.” That expression of confidence comes less than a week after EU antitrust regulators extended to Aug. 31 from Aug. 9 their deadline to decide whether to approve the deal. “We have done the right things to wrap this deal up,” Chenevert said, though he declined to directly address the state of the antitrust review. The world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners is also confident it will be able to close the sale of three small units that it put on the block in March — its Rocketdyne space business, the industrial arm of its Hamilton Sundstrand division, and its Clipper Windpower operation. Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech aims to be in contract on Rocketdyne by mid-June and is “seeing very good interest in the auction process for the industrial businesses,” Chenevert said at the Electrical Products Group conference in Longboat Key, Florida. The company expects to close its sale of Clipper by the year’s end, said Chenevert, whose talk was monitored over the Internet. United Tech put the three units up for sale to raise cash and avoid having to immediately issue new common shares to fund the Goodrich deal, its biggest acquisition in a decade. It originally planned to issue $4.6 billion in new shares to pay for the takeover. But in the face of shareholder objections, in March it unveiled a new plan to sell the three businesses — which it estimates will bring in about $3 billion — and to issue $1.5 billion in mandatory convertible notes, in addition to taking on debt. Chenevert declined to answer analysts’ questions on whether the company would be able to reduce or eliminate the number of new convertible notes, which would eventually become shares. United Tech shares were up 1 percent at $74.44 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. DEAL-MAKING PICKS UP The pace of deal-making has picked up in the manufacturing industry this year, most recently seen in Monday’s news that Eaton Corp has reached an $11.8 billion deal to acquire electrical equipment maker Cooper Industries Plc. United Tech officials earlier this month said negotiations to sell Rocketdyne were focused on one buyer. Private equity firms TPG Capital and Carlyle Group LP  are separately considering bids for the Hamilton industrial units, which make pumps and compressors, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. A return of private equity dealmakers to the sector could push takeover prices higher, said Brian Jellison, CEO of manufacturer Roper Industries Inc, speaking at the same conference on Monday. “Seller expectations are extraordinarily high, the highest ever. That’s because ... banks have lost, again, all discipline,” Jellison said, adding that his company was recently outbid on an acquisition it wanted to do by a private equity company. “People are buying and paying for quite a high price. I think it would be very interesting to see what ultimately United Technologies gets for Milton Roy and what do they get for Sullair and how does that kind of — does one person buy it and how does that work out,” Jellison said, referring to two of the Hamilton industrial arms that United Tech is aiming to sell.",5222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/unitedtech/update-1-united-tech-says-goodrich-deal-to-close-in-july-idUSL1E8GM7Z820120522

166,UTX,United Technologies launches $9.8 billion bond sale,"(Adds underwriters, detail) By Andrea Johnson and Danielle Robinson NEW YORK, May 24 (IFR) - The U.S. corporate bond market has shown Facebook how it’s done today, by pricing a bond offering of almost $10 billion from United Technologies Corp (UTX), making it the biggest investment-grade deal of the year. Up to $38 billion of orders were placed with underwriters on the deal, according to market sources. The six-part deal was split into fixed-rate tranches of three-, five-, 10- and 30-year maturities, as well as 18-month and three-year floating rate pieces. Getting the pricing right was crucial to the deal’s success and demonstrates the depth of the US bond market even during turbulent times. There have been some wild swings in the performance of new bond deals in recent weeks. “Sizing and pricing this appropriately is going to be crucial,” said one market participant as the deal was being marketed. “If this can create some performance, it will send a very positive signal to the marketplace that we’ve gotten to levels that clear. If they “Facebook” this thing, it will be really unfortunate.” UTX (UTX.N) received the message loud and clear. Unlike Facebook, which went for the highest pricing and the biggest possible size when it priced its initial public offering earlier this week, UTX left a generous amount of spread on the table for investors, in recognition that it was asking a lot in a market shaken by volatility. The strategy worked. “We heard it attracted over $32bn in orders, which is incredible,” said Rajeev Sharma, senior portfolio manager at First Investors Management Company in New York. “UTX is the type of name that is a cornerstone company for an investment-grade portfolio, and investors have gotten to a point where they have gone through so much and seen so much volatility, that they just want a name that can withstand the noise and UTX can do that.” UTX is raising the money to help fund the $18.4 billion acquisition of Goodrich. The deal ranks as the largest of 2012 so far, according to IFR data, beating out four-part deals from Petrobras and SABMiller, both of which totaled $7 billion. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and RBS were joint books on the UTX deal. The issuer first whispered pricing on the bonds at levels that offered as much as 45 basis points (bp) more than where its secondaries were trading this morning. The generous pricing sparked an avalanche of orders, especially for the 10- and 30-year tranches. According to one source the 10-year tranche alone - with initial price thoughts around 150bp over Treasuries - attracted more than $8 billion of demand. That enabled UTX to tighten in price thoughts to launch official price guidance about 10-15bp tighter than where it first whispered the deal, and then tighten about 3bp-7.5bp at launch.

According to Fitch Ratings, UTX plans to fund the Goodrich acquisition with about $9 billion - $11 billion of debt, which could include mandatory convertible debt. The company will also assume about $1.9 billion of Goodrich debt, net of cash. Divestiture proceeds and cash flow will cover the rest of the purchase price.

167,UTX,United Technologies launches $9.8 billion corp bond sale,"NEW YORK, May 24 (IFR) - The US corporate bond market has shown Facebook how it’s done today, by pricing a bond offering of almost $10 billion from United Technologies Corp (UTX), making it the biggest investment-grade deal of the year. Up to $38 billion of orders were placed with underwriters on the deal, according to market sources. The six-part deal was split into fixed-rate tranches of three-, five-, 10- and 30-year maturities, as well as 18-month and three-year floating rate pieces. Getting the pricing right was crucial to the deal’s success and demonstrates the depth of the US bond market even during turbulent times. There have been some wild swings in the performance of new bond deals in recent weeks. “Sizing and pricing this appropriately is going to be crucial,” said one market participant as the deal was being marketed. “If this can create some performance, it will send a very positive signal to the marketplace that we’ve gotten to levels that clear. If they “Facebook” this thing, it will be really unfortunate.” UTX (UTX.N) received the message loud and clear. Unlike Facebook, which went for the highest pricing and the biggest possible size when it priced its initial public offering earlier this week, UTX left a generous amount of spread on the table for investors, in recognition that it was asking a lot in a market shaken by volatility. The strategy worked. “We heard it attracted over $32bn in orders, which is incredible,” said Rajeev Sharma, senior portfolio manager at First Investors Management Company in New York. “UTX is the type of name that is a cornerstone company for an investment-grade portfolio, and investors have gotten to a point where they have gone through so much and seen so much volatility, that they just want a name that can withstand the noise and UTX can do that.” UTX is raising the money to help fund the $18.4 billion acquisition of Goodrich. The deal ranks as the largest of 2012 so far, according to IFR data, beating out four-part deals from Petrobras and SABMiller, both of which totaled $7 billion. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and RBS were joint books on the UTX deal. The issuer first whispered pricing on the bonds at levels that offered as much as 45 basis points (bp) more than where its secondaries were trading this morning.

172,UTX,TEXT-S&P; rates United Technologies' proposed sr unsec notes 'A',"May 24 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said today that it has assigned its ‘A’ issue rating to United Technologies Corp.’s proposed senior unsecured note offering. UTC will issue the notes under its WKSI shelf registration statement, with various maturities. UTC will 	 use the proceeds from the notes to fund a portion of its planned acquisition of Goodrich Corp.  The notes contain a mandatory redemption provision if the acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, is not completed by March 25, 2013. UTC currently expects to complete the acquisition in mid-2012. The ‘A’ rating on Hartford, Conn.-based industrial and aerospace product 	 manufacturer UTC reflect our expectations that the pending acquisition of 	 Goodrich Corp. will strengthen UTC’s business risk profile. This should be 	 enough to offset its less conservative financial policies and temper the 	 deterioration in financial leverage that will result from the transaction. We 	 believe the resulting business profile of UTC would be “excellent” and its 	 financial profile would be “intermediate.” We estimate that at closing, the pro forma ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDA 	 would increase to about 2.7x and adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to total 	 debt would weaken to about 30%. Under our base scenario, we expect that the 	 company will be able to subsequently reduce its debt with $3 billion of 	 identified asset divestitures and with a good portion of its $4 billion in 	 annual discretionary cash flow. We also expect the company to limit 	 acquisitions and share buybacks during that period. The combination of these 	 factors should decrease leverage toward 2x and increase FFO to debt to about 	 35%-40%, which we would view as appropriate for the rating, within the next 	 two years. However, if adverse end-market developments, an inability or 	 unwillingness to execute planned divestitures, or aggressive financial 	 decisions meaningfully delay or compromise the improvement we expect, we could 	 consider a lower rating. — Research Update: United Technologies ‘A/A-1’ Ratings Affirmed On 	 Updated Financing Plan For Goodrich Acquisition; Outlook Still Negative, March 	 16, 2012 — Corporate Ratings Criteria 2008, April 15, 2008 United Technologies Corp.

The European Commission, which has been examining the deal with which United Tech aims to build critical mass in new aircraft technology and plane services as civil aviation demand recovers, said on its website on Monday it had received the offer. United Tech, whose products include Pratt & Whitney engines and Sikorsky helicopters, has proposed divestments, said the sources, who declined to provide details because of the sensitivity of the matter. The Commission has set an August 31 deadline for a decision on the deal and has already asked for feedback from rivals and customers of Goodrich and United Tech, one of the sources said. United Tech said it still expected to close the deal next month. “All regulatory filings are on track and we continue to anticipate timing of close in line with what we have previously communicated. Beyond that we cannot comment on the details of the regulatory review,” spokesman John Moran said. United Tech chief executive Louis Chenevert told investors last month he was confident the Goodrich deal would close mid to late July, despite the EU review. Goodrich, which was not available to comment, supplies parts to several United Tech operations, including for Pratt & Whitney jet engines and its Hamilton Sundstrand’s aircraft electronics. Its commercial plane programs include the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A320neo. United Tech, also a leading maker of air conditioners and owns the Otis brand of elevators and escalators, has said it aimed to sell three smaller businesses - its Rocketdyne space unit, Clipper Windpower and some industrial units at the Hamilton Sundstrand aircraft components operation - to fund the Goodrich purchase. EU regulators opened an investigation into the deal in March after an initial assessment showed competition concerns in the markets for engine controls and AC power generators, because of the combined group’s high market share. The EU competition authorities also expressed concern about the loss of Goodrich as an independent supplier of fuel nozzles and engine controls, and as a player in aftermarket services. Goodrich last week sold its share of an engine controls joint venture to Rolls-Royce (RR.L), a deal which the British enginemaker had agreed with United Tech.

The diversified U.S. manufacturer said it had found additional sources of cash to fund the $16.5 billion purchase of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp GR.N. “We’ve identified more cash available for the financing so we didn’t need as much from the equity units,” said spokesman John Moran. When the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners first disclosed the Goodrich deal in September, it said it planned to issue up to $4.6 billion in common shares to pay for it. That proposal drew shareholder protests and prompted Chief Executive Louis Chenevert to change the funding approach, instead putting three small businesses — the Rocketdyne space unit, the industrial pumps and compressors operation and Clipper Windpower — up for sale to raise cash and avoid issuing so many new shares. At the time, United Tech officials said they expected to raise $3 billion through selling those businesses. Moran declined to say if the company now believed it would be able to make more from the sales. “We found other sources of cash but we’re not specifying what those are,” he said. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company on Wednesday said it had priced about 20 million equity units at $50 each. Investors who buy the units will be required to buy United Tech’s by August 1, 2015. The number of shares to be purchased will vary depending on the stock’s price when bought. United Tech officials have said they have narrowed the Rocketdyne talks down to one buyer and Chenevert told investors last month that he expects to have a contract signed for the Rocketdyne sale by mid-June.

185,UTX,United Technologies sees industrial units sale in Q3,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) expects to receive second-round bids for its industrial units that make pumps and compressors by the end of June, and could announce a deal in the third quarter, the company’s chief financial officer said on Thursday. Greg Hayes, speaking at an investor meeting in Chicago, said the auction process remains “robust” with “lots of interest” from private equity buyers, but also from other industrial companies. The diversified conglomerate is selling the industrial businesses of its Hamilton Sundstrand unit in an effort to fund its $16.5 billion takeover of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp GR.N. People familiar with the matter have said these units combined could be valued at more than $3.5 billion. “Some of the strategics are having a little bit more difficulty with their own stock price down but these are great properties and I think with the cost of capital where it is today, it’s a pretty compelling case for somebody that has a strategic fit that these businesses really are worth the price,” Hayes said. Private equity firms TPG Capital TPG.UL, Carlyle Group (CG.O) and BC Partners remain involved in the process and are considering buying both pump and compressor businesses, people familiar with the matter said this week. Other bidders are evaluating offers for either pumps or compressors only, the people said. Dover Corp (DOV.N) and Atlas Copco (ATCOa.ST) are interested in buying the pump business, while Gardner Denver Inc (GDI.N), Onex Corp OCX.TO and Advent International among others have been pursuing compressors, they said. Flowserve Corp (FLS.N) and SPX Corp SPW.N also expressed interest in buying the pump business, according to the people familiar with the matter, but two of the people said these companies’ interest has cooled in recent weeks. The pump business for sale has roughly $200 million in estimated 2012 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and may go for as much as 12 times EBITDA, sources said previously. The compressor business has some $160 million in forward EBITDA and may be sold for 8 to 9 times EBITDA, the sources have said. It remains to be seen if United Tech will choose to sell both pumps and compressors businesses to a single buyer, or sell them separately. The company is expected to weigh the potential valuation gains from selling them to different buyers, versus the simplicity of a deal in selling everything in one transaction, the people said. Representatives for Carlyle, TPG, BC Partners and Advent International declined to comment while Onex did not have an immediate comment. Dover, Atlas Copco, Flowserve, SPX and Gardner Denver all declined to comment. “We would hold onto the Hamilton Sundstrand businesses if we can’t get what we consider to be a fair and reasonable price,” Hayes said. “I think it’s still going to happen this year, I think we would have an announcement in the third quarter and close in the fourth.” The company may have a bit more selling to do this year, Hayes said, adding that it has recently completed a review of its fire and security operations - which make sprinkler systems and alarms - and is considering selling some of that portfolio as well. “It’ll be a very focused look at the portfolio,” he said. “They’re pretty much done with the analysis and over the next couple of months you’ll hear about more divestitures.” Hayes also said United Tech is evaluating “strategic alternatives” for its fuel-cell business.

186,UTX,United Tech: Europe's downturn worse than expected,"(Reuters) - Europe’s downturn has gotten worse than United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) executives expected coming into the year, and the company is concerned about Greece’s troubles spreading, a top executive at the diversified U.S. manufacturer said. “Clearly, the situation in Europe has gotten a lot worse than we had expected,” Greg Hayes, the company’s chief financial officer, said on Thursday. “As we sit here today facing the Greek elections... we are very concerned about Europe.” The eurozone countries represent about 17 percent of United Tech’s revenue, which the company expects to come in at about $61 billion to $62 billion this year, Hayes said. Greece is a small market for the Hartford, Connecticut-based company, with just $50 million to $60 million of revenue, but Spain is more meaningful with about $1 billion in sales. “The Spanish market continues to convulse,” Hayes said, with the company’s Otis elevator unit, in particular facing pressure on its selling prices. Otis’ primary competitors are ThyssenKrupp AG (TKAG.DE), Schindler Holding AG (SCHN.S) and Mitsubishi Electric (6503.T). Spain’s 10-year bonds on Thursday hit topped 7 percent, their highest level since the country joined the euro, and above the level where Greece, Ireland and Portugal were driven to seek bailouts. Elections in Greece on Sunday will help determine whether the debt-burdened country stays in the euro or pulls out of the currency bloc, a move that could send shockwaves across Europe. “Greece doesn’t bother me except for the contagion impact,” Hayes said. “What’s unfortunate in Europe is that they have the resources to fix the problem but unfortunately not the political will to do it yet,” Hayes said. “And I guess the question is not if but when they will come up with a solution to the problem over there.” The world’s biggest market of elevators and air conditioners has experienced a “significant slowdown” in China but “moderate growth” in the United States, Hayes added. He said he was more confident that U.S. political leaders would head off a budget crisis, which includes $500 billion in automatic additional defense cuts, unless Congress can reach agreement on other savings and revenues. “Our expectation is the fiscal cliff, the sequestration, it’s not going to happen. It’s not going to happen because of jobs,” said Hayes, whose company makes Black Hawk military helicopters and sells jet engines for military use. Hayes expressed confidence that after the November U.S. presidential and congressional elections people will put politics aside, leadership will emerge and they will do the right thing. “But unfortunately there is going to be a lot of uncertainty between now and then. But it’s solvable in the U.S. Not so solvable in Europe right now.” United Tech’s Pratt & Whitney jet engine unit has seen revenue pressured as airlines cut back on the amount of spare parts they are using for engine maintenance, Hayes said, estimating that revenue was down by about $300,000 to $400,000 each time an engine is brought into for maintenance. “This is airlines conserving cash, the same kind of behavior we saw back in late 2008, 2009,” Hayes said.

193,UTX,Exclusive: United Tech weighs $1 billion Pratt asset sale: sources,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp is looking to sell power generation assets within its Pratt and Whitney subsidiary in a deal that could fetch around $1 billion, according to three people familiar with the matter. The business, called Pratt & Whitney Power Systems, manufactures industrial gas turbines and geothermal power systems based on Pratt & Whitney’s aircraft engine technology, and helps generate electricity for businesses and cities. Deutsche Bank is advising United Technologies on the potential divestiture, one of the people said. The three sources spoke on Monday. All of them asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. A United Technologies spokesman declined to comment and Deutsche Bank also declined to comment. The potential sale is part of the diversified industrial conglomerate’s effort to focus more on the aerospace and propulsion segments and move away from businesses that are not seen as core, according to the people familiar with the matter. “While this is a good and profitable business, it’s not part of the core aerospace and propulsion business,” said a second source, adding that some potential buyers were already showing interest in the business, although it was still early in the process. A third source said the Pratt & Whitney power systems business needed some investment to get to the next phase of its growth plan, but United Tech preferred to put its capital more directly into the aerospace propulsion sector. The sale would likely occur after United Technologies closes its planned $16.5 billion purchase of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp, that person added.

195,UTX,United Technologies sent military copter tech to China,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp on Thursday admitted selling China software that helped Beijing develop its first modern military attack helicopter, one of hundreds of export control violations over nearly two decades. At a federal court hearing in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United Technologies and its two subsidiaries, Pratt & Whitney Canada and Hamilton Sundstrand Corp, agreed to pay more than $75 million to the U.S. government to settle criminal and administrative charges related to the violations. As part of the settlement, Pratt & Whitney Canada pleaded guilty to two federal criminal charges - violating a U.S. export control law and making false statements. Federal prosecutors said the company knew that its export of modified software to China would allow Beijing to test and develop its new military helicopter, called the Z-10, using 10 engines that had been legally exported as commercial items. They said the company’s motive was to gain access to China’s lucrative civilian helicopter market. “P&WC; exported controlled U.S. technology to China, knowing it would be used in the development of a military attack helicopter in violation of the U.S. arms embargo with China,” said U.S. Attorney David Fein of Connecticut. “P&WC; took what it described internally as a ‘calculated risk,’ because it wanted to become the exclusive supplier for a civil helicopter market in China with projected revenues of up to $2 billion,” Fein said. The case comes amid growing U.S. concerns about China’s military expansion and escalating electronic espionage. Federal authorities have brought five major cases since last February, involving everything from drone technology to radiation-hardened computers used in satellite communications. United Technologies said it accepted full responsibility for the violations and deeply regretted that they had occurred. It said it had already spent $30 million to beef up export controls and had hired more than 1,000 full and part-time employees to address the issue. “These violations revealed important opportunities to strengthen our export compliance program,” United Technologies Chief Executive Louis Chenevert said in a statement, adding that both the Justice and State departments had recognized the company’s “significant remedial actions.” Fein said the penalties were substantial, but analysts said they amounted to a slap on the wrist for a major global industrial conglomerate with annual revenues of $58.1 billion. Hamilton Sundstrand and Pratt & Whitney Canada also admitted that they had failed to make timely disclosures, required by regulations, to the U.S. State Department about the exports. The government said the $75 million settlement included $20.7 million in criminal fines, forfeitures and other penalties to be paid to the Justice Department, and $55 million in payments to the State Department as part of a consent agreement resolving 576 administrative export control violations. “The Justice Department will spare no effort to hold accountable those who compromise U.S. national security for the sake of profits and then lie about it to the government,” said Assistant Attorney General Lisa Monaco. About $20 million of the State Department fines may be used by the company for improving its export control procedures and hiring an independent monitor, United Technologies said. As part of the agreement, the U.S. State Department also will impose curbs on new export licenses for Pratt & Whitney Canada, although the company can request licenses on a case-by-case basis. The debarment does not affect the parent company or Hamilton Sundstrand, and the Canadian unit can request full reinstatement in one year. The company’s shares closed $1.56 lower on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, a drop of 2.1 percent. It said it had put money in reserve to cover the payments. Western experts said the Z-10, first delivered to China’s People’s Liberation Army in 2009, is developing into one of the world’s most modern and capable combat helicopters. Full production of the Z-10 would give China’s military unprecedented levels of “aerial artillery” to support an amphibious invasion and subsequent operations against Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own, said Richard Fisher, an expert on China’s military use of so-called dual-use technologies. U.S. authorities said China had been trying to develop a specialized modern military attack helicopter since the 1980s. But since the Chinese government’s 1989 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, the U.S. government has prohibited the export to China of U.S. defense equipment and technology. The U.S. case against United Technologies said P&WC; knew as early as 2000 that China’s effort to develop a new helicopter involved a military variant, but repeatedly made false statements about its knowledge. U.S. authorities said that Pratt & Whitney Canada’s initial involvement in the program was to deliver 10 engines to China from Canada in 2001 and 2002. The company believed the engines did not constitute defense equipment subject to the U.S. military embargo on China because the engines were identical to those it was supplying China for commercial helicopters. The problem arose when Hamilton Sundstrand delivered certain modifications to the engine control software, which allowed China to test and develop the Pratt & Whitney Canada engines as it was developing the new military helicopter. U.S. authorities say the software modifications were specifically for use on the military program, making them subject to the U.S. military embargo on China. According to court documents, Pratt & Whitney Canada allegedly knew from the outset of the Z-10 project in 2000 that China was developing a military helicopter, but failed to notify its U.S. parent and Hamilton Sundstrand until years later. According to court documents, in one 2001 internal e-mail, a Pratt & Whitney Canada manager said: “We must be very careful that the helicopter programs we are doing with the Chinese are not presented or viewed as military programs. As a result of these sanctions, we need to be very careful with the Z10C program. If the first flight will be a gunship, then we could have problems with the U.S. government.” In the United States, U.S. investigators say, Hamilton Sundstrand believed it was providing its software to Pratt & Whitney Canada for use in a civilian Chinese helicopter, although it learned in 2004 about a possible export law problem and stopped working on the Z-10 program. But authorities say Pratt & Whitney Canada then modified software on its own and continued to export it to China through June 2005. A law enforcement source said the companies did not even launch an internal inquiry until a non-governmental organization involved in examining “socially responsible” investments in February 2006 asked United Technologies whether Pratt & Whitney Canada’s involvement in the Z-10’s development might violate U.S. export laws. The group threatened to recommend that investors sell their holdings in UTC. That investigation led to an initial disclosure, in July 2006, to U.S. authorities about the Z-10 issue. Analysts said the settlement was a setback for United Technologies, which is trying to transform itself into an aerospace giant. But the penalties are unlikely to affect the company’s sales in China, which accounted for almost $10 billion of its 2011 sales. “It’s certainly a black eye,” said analyst Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. United Tech expects to close in coming weeks on its $16.5 billion acquisition of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp. It has put three units up for sale, including the industrial arm of the Hamilton Sundstrand division. Jay DeFrank, a spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, said the company continued to do business in China, but it had launched major efforts to educate all 70,000 employees in United Technologies’ aerospace units about export controls. “China is and remains an important market for UTC and we will continue to do business there in full compliance with the law,” he said. The Obama administration has lent high-level backing to United Technologies’ work in China. Then-Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, now the U.S. ambassador to China, visited a Pratt & Whitney joint venture in Shanghai in May 2010, according to the company’s website.

It said it had already spent $30 million to beef up export controls and had hired more than 1,000 full and part-time employees to address the issue. “These violations revealed important opportunities to strengthen our export compliance program,” United Technologies Chief Executive Louis Chenevert said in a statement, adding that both the Justice and State departments had recognized the company’s “significant remedial actions.” Fein said the penalties were substantial, but analysts said they amounted to a slap on the wrist for a major global industrial conglomerate with annual revenues of $58.1 billion. Hamilton Sundstrand and Pratt & Whitney Canada also admitted that they had failed to make timely disclosures, required by regulations, to the U.S. State Department about the exports. The government said the $75 million settlement included $20.7 million in criminal fines, forfeitures and other penalties to be paid to the Justice Department, and $55 million in payments to the State Department as part of a consent agreement resolving 576 administrative export control violations. “The Justice Department will spare no effort to hold accountable those who compromise U.S. national security for the sake of profits and then lie about it to the government,” said Assistant Attorney General Lisa Monaco. About $20 million of the State Department fines may be used by the company for improving its export control procedures and hiring an independent monitor, United Technologies said. As part of the agreement, the U.S. State Department also will impose curbs on new export licenses for Pratt & Whitney Canada, although the company can request licenses on a case-by-case basis. The debarment does not affect the parent company or Hamilton Sundstrand, and the Canadian unit can request full reinstatement in one year. The company’s shares closed $1.56 lower on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, a drop of 2.1 percent. It said it had put money in reserve to cover the payments. Western experts said the Z-10, first delivered to China’s People’s Liberation Army in 2009, is developing into one of the world’s most modern and capable combat helicopters. Full production of the Z-10 would give China’s military unprecedented levels of “aerial artillery” to support an  amphibious invasion and subsequent operations against Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own, said Richard Fisher, an expert on China’s military use of so-called dual-use technologies. U.S. authorities said China had been trying to develop a specialized modern military attack helicopter since the 1980s. But since the Chinese government’s 1989 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, the U.S. government has prohibited the export to China of U.S. defense equipment and technology. The U.S. case against United Technologies said P&WC; knew as early as 2000 that China’s effort to develop a new helicopter involved a military variant, but repeatedly made false statements about its knowledge. U.S. authorities said that Pratt & Whitney Canada’s initial involvement in the program was to deliver 10 engines to China from Canada in 2001 and 2002. The company believed the engines  did not constitute defense equipment subject to the U.S. military embargo on China because the engines were identical to those it was supplying China for commercial helicopters. The problem arose when Hamilton Sundstrand delivered certain modifications to the engine control software, which allowed China to test and develop the Pratt & Whitney Canada engines as it was developing the new military helicopter. U.S. authorities say the software modifications were specifically for use on the military program, making them subject to the U.S. military embargo on China. According to court documents, Pratt & Whitney Canada allegedly knew from the outset of the Z-10 project in 2000 that China was developing a military helicopter, but failed to notify its U.S. parent and Hamilton Sundstrand until years later. According to court documents, in one 2001 internal e-mail, a Pratt & Whitney Canada manager said: “We must be very careful that the helicopter programs we are doing with the Chinese are not presented or viewed as military programs. As a result of these sanctions, we need to be very careful with the Z10C program. If the first flight will be a gunship, then we could have problems with the U.S. government.” In the United States, U.S. investigators say, Hamilton Sundstrand believed it was providing its software to Pratt & Whitney Canada for use in a civilian Chinese helicopter, although it learned in 2004 about a possible export law problem and stopped working on the Z-10 program. But authorities say Pratt & Whitney Canada then modified software on its own and continued to export it to China through June 2005. A law enforcement source said the companies did not even launch an internal inquiry until a non-governmental organization involved in examining “socially responsible” investments in February 2006 asked United Technologies whether Pratt & Whitney Canada’s involvement in the Z-10’s development might violate U.S. export laws. The group threatened to recommend that investors sell their holdings in UTC. That investigation led to an initial disclosure, in July 2006, to U.S. authorities about the Z-10 issue. Analysts said the settlement was a setback for United Technologies, which is trying to transform itself into an aerospace giant. But the penalties are unlikely to affect the company’s sales in China, which accounted for almost $10 billion of its 2011 sales. “It’s certainly a black eye,” said analyst Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. United Tech expects to close in coming weeks on its $16.5 billion acquisition of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp . It has put three units up for sale, including the industrial arm of the Hamilton Sundstrand division. Jay DeFrank, a spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, said the company continued to do business in China, but it had launched major efforts to educate all 70,000 employees in United Technologies’ aerospace units about export controls. “China is and remains an important market for UTC and we will continue to do business there in full compliance with the law,” he said.

201,UTX,United Technologies sent military copter tech to China,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp on Thursday admitted selling China software that helped Beijing develop its first modern military attack helicopter, one of hundreds of export control violations over nearly two decades. At a federal court hearing in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United Technologies and its two subsidiaries, Pratt & Whitney Canada and Hamilton Sundstrand Corp, agreed to pay more than $75 million to the U.S. government to settle criminal and administrative charges related to the violations. As part of the settlement, Pratt & Whitney Canada pleaded guilty to two federal criminal charges - violating a U.S. export control law and making false statements. Federal prosecutors said the company knew that its export of modified software to China would allow Beijing to test and develop its new military helicopter, called the Z-10, using 10 engines that had been legally exported as commercial items. They said the company harmed national security while trying to gain access to China’s lucrative civilian helicopter market. “P&WC; exported controlled U.S. technology to China, knowing it would be used in the development of a military attack helicopter in violation of the U.S. arms embargo with China,” said U.S. Attorney David Fein of Connecticut. “P&WC; took what it described internally as a ‘calculated risk,’ because it wanted to become the exclusive supplier for a civil helicopter market in China with projected revenues of up to $2 billion,” Fein said. The case comes amid growing U.S. concerns about China’s military expansion and escalating electronic espionage. Federal authorities have brought five major cases since last February, involving everything from drone technology to radiation-hardened computers used in satellite communications. United Technologies said it accepted full responsibility for the violations and deeply regretted that they had occurred. It said it had spent $30 million and hired more than 1,000 full and part-time employees to beef up its internal export oversight. “These violations revealed important opportunities to strengthen our export compliance program,” United Technologies Chief Executive Louis Chenevert said in a statement, adding that both the Justice and State departments had recognized the company’s “significant remedial actions.” Fein said the penalties were substantial, but analysts said they amounted to a slap on the wrist for a major global industrial conglomerate with annual revenues of $58.1 billion. “The fine is substantial ... but it’s fairly modest measured against the company’s overall revenues,” said Loren Thompson, analyst with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute. “It will not have a material impact on the company’s financial results.” Hamilton Sundstrand and Pratt & Whitney Canada also admitted that they had failed to make timely disclosures, required by regulations, to the U.S. State Department about the exports. The government said the $75 million settlement included $20.7 million in criminal fines, forfeitures and other penalties to be paid to the Justice Department, and $55 million in payments to the State Department as part of a consent agreement resolving 576 administrative export control violations. About $20 million of the State Department fines may be used by the company for improving its export control procedures and hiring an independent monitor, United Technologies said. The export control violations ranged from problems with classification, inadequate monitoring of existing export agreements, and even controls imposed on foreign visitors. One case centered on the export to Venezuela of a test stand for an F100 engine used for F-16 fighter planes that was falsely classified as commercial because it used only commercial items. The individual responsible is still being hunted by U.S. law enforcement officials. “The Justice Department will spare no effort to hold accountable those who compromise U.S. national security for the sake of profits and then lie about it to the government,” said Assistant Attorney General Lisa Monaco.

The acquisition is the largest in a decade for United Tech, whose products include Pratt & Whitney engines, Sikorsky helicopters and the Otis brand of elevators and escalators. United Tech offered concessions to the European Commission last month after the EU regulator expressed worries about the combined companies’ very high market shares in engine controls and AC power generators. “The Commission is expected to clear the deal conditionally. It is likely to make a decision before the summer break,” said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.

207,UTX,United Tech export case highlights risks in global trade,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - William Swanson, head of U.S. missile maker Raytheon, gathered 100 colleagues on the eve of Britain’s Farnborough Airshow this week to review the company’s strict rules for interacting with international arms buyers. “I’m trying to make sure my tone’s loud and clear,” Swanson told Reuters afterward in an interview. “I kind of treat the brand the way I treat my family name.” Weeks after United Technologies agreed to pay $75 million in fines for export violations, Raytheon’s chief executive was not alone in taking firm precautions ahead of the world’s largest air show, which draws up to 300,000 people, including buyers from around the world. U.S. federal law sets strict rules for what U.S. companies can sell overseas and how they may interact with foreign buyers. Big exporters like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co and others impose their own additional regulations to ensure strict compliance with U.S. laws. At an event like an air show, where thousands of people are milling around and top executives with security clearances are more accessible than usual, security minders are on high alert. Some companies provide their globe-trotting executives with specially encrypted computers; others prohibit the use of laptops on overseas travel; all require meticulous documentation of every conversation with any foreign citizen. Lost or stolen laptops can be a huge liability, as the U.S. government’s case against United Technologies demonstrates. One violation in that case involved an employee who left a laptop containing sensitive technical data at a Shanghai airport during a trip to China in December 2009. The company failed to retrieve it until six months later, but weaknesses in the company’s subsequent forensic investigation made it impossible to determine whether the laptop was accessed during that time, according to the State Department’s charging letter. Even company identification cards pose a risk. One executive had to leave his card at home when visiting some countries because its embedded smart chip could not be exported there. The U.S. government decides which warplanes or other weapons systems can be exhibited at every air show. Every display is carefully scrubbed for any potentially damaging trade secrets. Guests and journalists are pre-screened by compliance officers before they can enter the companies’ swanky hospitality chalets, where champagne and canapés are served. At corporate offices back home, photographs or video recordings are often strictly prohibited. “If you do international business, you always ought to be aware. You can never relax,” said Swanson, who says he’s taken to heart some advice that Charlie Adams, a former Raytheon chief executive, gave him long ago: “If it’s gray, walk away.” Swanson said he’d probably been through over 100 compliance training sessions during his 41 years with the company — in part to show Raytheon employees how seriously he takes it. There was more buzz about export controls at this year’s air show after United Technologies last month admitted selling China software later used by Beijing to develop its first modern military attack helicopter. News of the case came amid increasing candor by top U.S. officials about extensive electronic espionage by China, Russia and other countries on U.S. private, military and government computer networks, with a particular focus on weapons makers. David Hess, president of Pratt & Whitney, parent of one of the subsidiaries, said the case was “a big disappointment” and the company was committed to improving the way it does business. “We’ve been very clear with both the outside world and with our employees that we’re going to use this as a call to arms,” he said. “We’re not making excuses. We’ve made some mistakes. We’ve learned from them and we’re going to go forward.” Marillyn Hewson, who will become president and chief operating officer of Lockheed in January and has been with the company for 29 years, said the largest U.S. weapons maker provided ongoing training for employees and had a large infrastructure around export controls. “It’s not just a one-time inoculation to get ready for an air show; it’s an ongoing institutionalized part of the business,” Hewson told Reuters at the air show. One senior executive, who asked not to be named, said he knew that his e-mail account was regularly targeted by would-be hackers, and he fully expected his hotel room to be wiretapped when he traveled overseas. “I always end up in exactly the same room when I check into certain hotels,” he said. He also knew the stakes involved, noting that any misstep that resulted in data losses could put his former colleagues in the military at risk, jeopardize national security or lead to the loss of proprietary information worth billions of dollars. John Garrison, president and chief executive of Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc, said his company has a large group of people whose sole job is to review every business deal for possible export control issues. “Compliance is an absolutely foundational element for us. We will not take short cuts on anything,” he said. Garrison said Bell had met with officials from Pratt after the export violations were reported since Pratt supplies the engines for two of its commercial helicopters, and they assured Bell there were “no impacts” on those programs.

209,UTX,Exclusive: United Tech in talks to sell Rocketdyne to GenCorp - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is in final discussions to sell its Rocketdyne business to GenCorp Inc GY.N, a maker of aerospace propulsion systems, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The deal, which may come late this week or early next week according to one of the sources, represents part of the diversified U.S. conglomerate’s efforts to divest non-core units and focus on closing its $16.5 billion acquisition of aircraft component maker Goodrich Corp GR.N. The companies are still working out final details of the transaction and the talks could still fall apart, the people cautioned, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public. United Tech declined to comment, while GenCorp was not immediately available for comment. Rocketdyne, the world’s largest manufacturer of liquid-fueled rocket propulsion systems, has been facing an uncertain outlook following the end of the U.S. space shuttle program last year, and industry executives have said consolidation is needed for the space industry to survive a tough environment. The sale would come more than seven years after United Tech bought Rocketdyne from Boeing Co (BA.N) for $700 million in cash. Rocketdyne makes liquid rocket motors to launch satellites into space but has also begun to diversify into solar and gasified coal energy technologies. GenCorp’s Aerojet subsidiary and Alliant Techsystems ATK.N produce solid rocket motors. Several people familiar with the process told Reuters previously that United Tech had received multiple bids for the Rocketdyne business in late March, with GenCorp and private equity firms among interested parties.

211,UTX,GenCorp to pay $550 million for United Tech's space unit,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) agreed to sell its Rocketdyne space unit to GenCorp Inc GY.N, a maker of aerospace propulsion systems, for $550 million, the companies said on Monday, a deal that will fund a slice of United Tech’s largest-ever acquisition. Rocketdyne, the world’s largest manufacturer of liquid-fueled rocket propulsion systems, is one of three units United Tech Chief Executive Louis Chenevert put on the block in an effort to fund the diversified U.S. manufacturer’s $16.5 billion takeover of Goodrich Corp GR.N. GenCorp, whose shares jumped nearly 15 percent to a market capitalization of roughly $460 million, said the deal would almost double its size. United Technologies, which will sell the company for $150 million less than it paid for it more than seven years ago, saw its shares decline more than 1.5 percent. GenCorp Chief Executive Officer Scott Seymour said the combined company would be better positioned for a highly competitive marketplace and could provide more affordable products to customers. Rocket motor makers such as GenCorp and Rocketdyne have faced an uncertain outlook since the U.S. space shuttle program ended last year. Industry executives have said consolidation is needed for the space industry to survive a tough environment. The companies said they expect the deal, first reported by Reuters last week, to close in the first half of 2013. Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech is still working to sell the industrial pumps and compressors business of its Hamilton Sundstrand business, as well as Clipper Windpower. When United Tech unveiled plans to buy Goodrich last year, it said it planned to issue $4.6 billion in new shares to help pay for the deal. But shareholders opposed that. In June United Tech sold $1 billion in convertible notes to fund the deal. The company last month said it expected to reach a deal to sell the pumps and compressors operations in the current quarter, with Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes saying there had been “lots of interest” in the business. Sources have told Reuters the business could be worth up to $3.5 billion. Investors may get a deeper look into United Tech’s progress in selling the other units on Thursday when the world’s biggest maker of elevators and escalators reports second-quarter results. Analysts, on average, look for essentially flat revenue and earnings at United Tech, as Europe’s economic problems and a slowing Chinese economy crimp sales of everything from Otis elevators to spare jet engine parts. United Tech shares were down 1.8 percent to $72.91 on the New York Stock Exchange. GenCorp shares surged about 15 percent to $7.69. The Rocketdyne deal comes more than seven years after United Tech bought the business from Boeing Co (BA.N) for $700 million in cash. Rocketdyne makes liquid rocket motors to launch satellites into space but has also begun to diversify into solar and gasified coal energy technologies. GenCorp’s Aerojet subsidiary and Alliant Techsystems Inc ATK.N produce solid-fuel rocket motors. Several people familiar with the process told Reuters previously that United Tech received multiple bids for the Rocketdyne business in late March, with GenCorp and private equity firms among the interested parties. Talks resumed in earnest with GenCorp after a prospective deal with a private equity buyer fell through, the sources told Reuters. Defense consultant Jim McAleese said the deal with GenCorp was significant because it would help preserve “a critical, but atrophying, capability since Rocketdyne’s liquid rocket engines power both the Air Force’s Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle and NASA’s Manned Spaceflight.” He said he did not expect much objection to the deal since it would “immediately strengthen competition, by creating two strong competitors for liquid and solid rocket engines,” the combined Aerojet-Rocketdyne business and Alliant Techsystems. “This is exactly the type of modest consolidation that (the U.S. Department of Defense) has been publicly seeking to increase competition and reduce overhead, which could not be more timely given the growing threat of sequestration,” McAleese said, referring to $500 billion in defense spending cuts that could come in January. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Moelis advised United Tech on the Rocketdyne sale. GenCorp was advised by Citigroup (C.N).

217,UTX,"United Tech beats Street, closes Goodrich deal","(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) posted second-quarter profit on Thursday that topped analysts’ expectations, and closed its largest-ever acquisition, the $16.5 billion takeover of Goodrich Corp GR.N. The higher-than-expected profit overshadowed the company’s warning that full-year earnings would be roughly flat with 2011 due to the weak European economy, as declining sales of spare parts for jet engines and elevators slow revenue growth. The purchase of Goodrich, a maker of landing gear and other aircraft components, will build on United Tech’s current Pratt & Whitney jet engine and Hamilton Sundstrand aircraft electronics arms, increasing the range of equipment it sells to top jet makers Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus EAD.PA. The world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners said it would step up planned restructuring spending to $500 million this year from a prior $450 million target, as it copes with a slowing economy. “It is certainly a challenging environment out there, with a slowing global economy,” Chief Executive Louis Chenevert told analysts on a conference call. “We know how to operate in a tough macroeconomic environment.” The Hartford, Connecticut-based company’s better-than-expected profit came despite a sharper-than-expected decline in sales. Fellow blue chip 3M Co (MMM.N) also beat quarterly earnings forecasts on Thursday despite light revenue thanks to tight spending controls. [ID:nL2E8IQ1EN] Second-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders came to $1.33 billion, up less than 1 percent from $1.32 billion a year earlier. Earnings of $1.62 per share from continuing operations beat the analysts’ average forecast of $1.41, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results were another example of a company managing its way through Europe’s woes, analysts said. “At this point in earnings season, the ‘Europe will kill us’ thing is being put to rest,” said analyst Brian Langenberg, of Langenberg & Co. Revenue fell 4.6 percent to $13.81 billion from $14.47 billion and below Wall Street estimates of $14.44 billion. Factoring out the weakening euro and the sale of some businesses, revenue would have been up 1 percent. United Tech shares were up 0.7 percent at $73.10 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, driven by the beat. The Goodrich deal, which the companies agreed to in September, closed about a month later than United Tech had hoped for, as it awaited final regulatory approvals. Those came on Thursday, when European, U.S. and Canadian authorities signed off on the deal, with the proviso that United Tech sell Goodrich’s power generation and small-engine control operations, which generate about $250 million in annual sales. “That took the uncertainty off the table,” said Matt Collins, an analyst at Edward Jones. “Anytime you hear the European regulators looking into anything, you get nervous.” Investors in the capital goods space are particularly attuned to European reviews of deals, since the European Commission in 2001 blocked General Electric Co (GE.N)’s planned $42 billion takeover of Honeywell International Inc (HON.N). United Tech’s Chenevert, who has served as chairman since 2010, shook up his company’s portfolio of businesses to get his hands on Goodrich, which also makes aircraft wheels and brakes. After shareholders objected to his initial plan to finance the deal in part by selling $4.6 billion in new common shares, Chenevert said he would sell off four smaller businesses — Rocketdyne, Hamilton Sundstrand’s industrial pumps and compressors operations, Clipper Windpower and United Tech’s fuel-cell business — to raise cash for the deal. United Tech this week reached deals to sell the industrial pumps and compressors units to Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) and BC Partners Ltd, as well as its Rocketdyne space unit to GenCorp Inc GY.N. Together the businesses raised $4.1 billion. It expects to reach a deal to sell Clipper over the next few weeks, said Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes. Those unit sales allowed United Tech to dramatically reduce the amount of equity it needed, and the company in June sold $1 billion of convertible notes to plug the gap. “We have completed the financing for Goodrich with a structure that was much better than was originally expected,” Chenevert said on Thursday, in a rare appearance on the company’s quarterly earnings call with investors. Chenevert said United Tech, whose shares have lost almost 3 percent of their value since it announced the deal in September, had already assigned a team of 50 employees to work on integrating Goodrich and identified some $400 million of annual costs that it expects to cut out of the combined operations over the next five years. United Tech plans to name former Goodrich CEO Marshall Larsen to its board in September. The new unit will be folded into the company’s Propulsion & Aerospace Systems arm, headed by CEO Alain Bellemare. United Tech lowered its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $5.25 to $5.35 per share, representing roughly flat profit, down from an April outlook of $5.30 to $5.50. The company said it expected 2012 sales of $58 billion to $59 billion, representing growth of about 5 percent, compared with the previous forecast of $61 billion to $62 billion. The euro’s fall against the dollar has hit manufacturers this quarter, as it cuts the value of sales made in Europe. It also lowered its sales forecasts for Otis elevator, largely due to weakness in China, and Pratt & Whitney, where it now expects sales of spare parts for commercial engines to fall 10 percent this year. United Tech’s industrial peers, including GE, Honeywell and Textron Inc (TXT.N), have largely beaten Wall Street’s forecasts for the quarter, easing worries about a slowing global economy.

221,UTX,United Tech cuts profit forecast; sales fall 5 percent,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) reported a 4.6 percent drop in quarterly sales and cut its earnings forecast for the rest of the year, as a slowing Chinese economy and Europe’s financial woes eroded demand for its elevators and jet engine parts. The world’s biggest maker of elevators and escalators also said on Thursday that it had won final regulatory approvals for its $16.5 billion acquisition of Goodrich Corp GR.N, a maker of aircraft landing gear, setting the stage for that deal to close later this week. United Tech, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters, now expects earnings to be roughly flat for the year on a 5 percent rise in revenue, a revision that takes into account the decline in the value of the euro. Its shares were up 0.5 percent at $73.00 in premarket trading. This week United Tech wrapped up two unit sales it had been counting on to help fund the Goodrich acquisition. Late on Wednesday it agreed to sell some industrial component parts of its Hamilton Sundstrand arm to Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) and BC Partners Ltd for $3.46 billion, just two days after reaching a $550 million deal to sell its Rocketdyne space arm to GenCorp Inc GY.N. Those deals helped the company sharply reduce the amount of equity it needed to issue to fund the Goodrich acquisition. When it announced the deal in September, it had planned to sell $4.6 billion in new common shares. It backed away from that move, which was unpopular with stockholders and last month sold just $1 billion of convertible notes. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company lowered its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $5.25 to $5.35 per share, down from an April outlook of $5.30 to $5.50. United Tech said it expected 2012 sales of $58 billion to $59 billion, compared with the previous forecast of $61 billion to $62 billion. United Tech said second-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders came to $1.33 billion, up less than 1 percent from $1.32 billion a year earlier. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations came to $1.62, above analysts’ forecast of $1.41, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 4.6 percent to $13.81 billion from $14.47 billion and below Wall Street’s $14.44 billion expectation. Factoring out the weakening euro and the sale of some businesses, it would have been up 1 percent. The results treat Rocketdyne and the Hamilton industrial arms — as well as United Tech’s Clipper Windpower and fuel cell businesses, for which the company is still seeking buyers — as discontinued. The euro’s fall against the dollar has hit the industrial sector this quarter, as it diminishes the value of sales made in Europe. United Tech’s industrial peers, including General Electric Co (GE.N), Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) and Textron Inc (TXT.N) have largely beaten Wall Street’s expectations for the quarter, easing investor worries about a slowing global economy and leaving the Standard & Poor’s capital goods industry index .GSPIC up 2 percent over the last five days of trading.

225,UTX,United Tech sells industrial units for $3.46 billion,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) has agreed to sell industrial businesses of its Hamilton Sundstrand subsidiary to Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) and BC Partners Ltd for $3.46 billion, the companies said on Wednesday, a deal that will help fund United Tech’s largest-ever acquisition. The transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, underscores private equity’s appetite for assets being carved out of industrial conglomerates and the still-robust financing markets for leveraged buyouts in the United States. Diversified U.S. manufacturer United Tech put three units, including the Hamilton Sundstrand industrial businesses, on the auction block in an effort to fund its $16.5 billion takeover of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp GR.N. Reuters reported on Monday that two buyout firms had teamed up and were in advance discussions to buy the pump and compressor businesses within Hamilton Sundstrand for about $3.5 billion. Hamilton Sundstrand makes fluid control products and pumps under the Milton Roy and Sundyne brands. It also manufacturers air compressors under the Sullair brand. Although Carlyle and BC Partners bid for the entire unit, several industrial companies such as SPX Corp SPW.N, Flowserve Corp (FLS.N), Dover Corp (DOV.N), Atlas Copco AB (ATCOa.ST), and Gardner Denver (GDI.N), as well as private equity firm TPG Capital LP, looked at buying separate parts of the business. United Tech decided on a quicker and less risky sale by keeping the business together. Carlyle and BC Partners were attracted to the scale and low capital expenditure requirements of the combined business and see opportunities to invest in areas such as flow control, rather than in operational improvement. “Teaming up with Carlyle gives us more firepower on a combined basis to invest in the business, both organically and potentially through acquisitions, as appropriate,” Mark Fariborz, a partner at BC Partners, told Reuters. On Monday, United Tech also reached a $550 million deal to sell its Rocketdyne space unit to GenCorp Inc GY.N, a maker of aerospace propulsion systems. When United Tech unveiled plans to buy Goodrich last year, it said it planned to issue $4.6 billion in new shares to finance the deal. But shareholders opposed that and the Hartford, Connecticut-based conglomerate has put assets on the auction block to help pay for the deal. Citigroup (C.N) and RBC Capital Markets advised BC Partners and Carlyle on the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Citigroup, Credit Suisse CSGN.VX, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), RBC Capital Markets and UBS UBSN.VX are providing debt financing.

231,UTX,United Tech lands buyer for Clipper Windpower,"Aug 7 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp said on Tuesday it has sold its Clipper Windpower unit to Platinum Equity for an undisclosed sum, wrapping up its third divestiture of the year following its largest-ever acquisition. The world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners in March said it would sell Clipper, its Rocketdyne space unit and some industrial pump and compressor operations of its Hamilton Sundstrand arm to raise cash to fund the acquisition of aircraft components maker Goodrich. Last month it closed the Goodrich deal and reached agreements worth $4.1 billion to sell the pumps and compressors arm to Carlyle Group LP and DC Partners Ltd, and to sell Rocketdyne to GenCorp Inc. Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech bought a minority stake in Clipper in early 2010, intending to slowly explore the then-fast-growing wind market. But Clipper ran into liquidity problems later that year and United Tech wound up buying the rest of the company, reasoning that was a safer bet than lending money to a firm that had well-financed competitors including General Electric Co, Siemens AG and Vestas . “We all make mistakes,” Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said of the Clipper deal in March of this year when the company put it up for sale.

The U.S. industrial conglomerate closed its largest-ever acquisition last month on condition that United Tech sell some of Goodrich’s power generation and small-engine control units that generate about $250 million in annual revenue. Those assets combined are expected to fetch more than $500 million and have attracted strong initial interest from rival aerospace companies in the United States and Europe, two of the people said.

United Tech did not have an immediate comment, while Citi declined to comment. The divestiture follows a string of other deals United Tech has completed in recent months to help finance the Goodrich takeover. In July, United Tech agreed to sell the industrial pump and compressor operations of its Hamilton Sundstrand arm to Carlyle Group LP and BC Partners for $3.46 billion, and struck a $550 million deal to sell its Rocketdyne space unit to GenCorp Inc.

251,UTX,United Tech sees 2013 profit up about 13 percent,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) expects profit to rise about 13 percent next year, with recovering demand for its systems used in buildings helping to offset declining U.S. defense spending. The world’s No. 1 maker of elevators and air conditioners, whose other businesses include jet engines and helicopters, on Thursday projected 2013 earnings of between $5.85 to $6.15 per share. At the midpoint would represent a 13 percent rise from the $5.32 per share it expects to report for 2012. Analysts, on average, expect 2013 earnings of $6.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That growth will come in the face of an uneven global economy, Chief Executive Louis Chenevert told investors in New York. “The challenging macroeconomic environment will continue,” Chenevert said, adding that the company expects roughly flat sales in Europe, with mid-single-digit percentage growth in the United States and Asia. “The two biggest drivers of the economy are consumer spending and housing showing signs of recovery and oil prices that have settled down.” The company also said it plans to buy back about $1 billion of its shares, though Chenevert said he would like to push that number higher. United Tech expects 2013 revenue to reach $64 billion to $65 billion, an 11 percent rise from the $58 billion it now expects for 2012. Wall Street had expected sales to reach $66.4 billion next year. It expects sales of jet engines and other equipment to commercial airlines and recovering demand from the construction sector for its Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners to offset a decline in sales of military engines and helicopters. It forecast organic sales — a measure that excludes the effect of acquisitions and currency fluctuations — to rise 3 percent to 5 percent. This has been an eventful year for the Hartford, Connecticut-based company. In July, United Technologies closed its largest-ever acquisition, the $16.5 billion takeover of aircraft components maker Goodrich. It sold several smaller operations to help fund the deal after Wall Street objected to Chenevert’s initial financing plan of selling shares. Having closed those deals, Chenevert said the company is focused on existing businesses, not pursuing other deals. “The transformation is essentially complete,” he said. Faced with the uncertainty of the U.S. budget standoff in Washington, a downturn in Europe and uneven growth in major Asian economies, big U.S. manufacturers this week have offered cautious guidance for 2013.

256,UTX,Pratt & Whitney wins contract for Embraer's new E-Jets,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney won a contract to supply engines for plane maker Embraer’s (ERJ.N) revamped family of regional E-Jets, the companies said on Tuesday, dealing a blow to General Electric Co (GE.N), the current supplier. Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), also edged out Rolls Royce (RR.L) with its bid to supply a version of the geared turbo fan powering the Airbus EAD.PA A320neo and Bombardier’s (BBDb.TO) CSeries. With the new engine, Embraer joins an industry push for more fuel-efficient jets. The trend intensified last year, when Boeing (BA.N) answered the new Airbus narrowbody with its own 737 MAX. Embraer said the new PW1700G and PW1900G engines, along with redesigned wings, would offer “double-digit improvements” in fuel efficiency, noise, emissions and maintenance costs. “This is more than just a new engine,” said Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva, the head of commercial aviation at Embraer. “This is a second generation of E-Jet to help us maintain our leadership of the 70- to 120-seat segment.” With approval from its board of directors in coming months, Brazil’s Embraer, the world’s No. 3 commercial plane maker, aims to overhaul its E-Jets and begin delivering the new planes in 2018. Silva said there would then be a three- or four-year overlap between generations as the new aircraft enter service. Shares of United Technologies slipped 1.2 percent on Tuesday, while shares of U.S.-based GE closed down 1.1 percent and Rolls Royce lost 0.3 percent. Embraer’s New York-listed shares dropped 5.5 percent after analysts at J.P.Morgan warned that the company would need to cut production due to a dwindling order backlog. The existing E-Jet family has made Embraer the world’s largest regional jet maker, but Canada’s Bombardier won a major order from Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) in December, helping to steal the 2012 sales lead and reignite their historic rivalry. Silva said the next generation of E-Jets would have little effect on negotiations to modernize the regional fleets of U.S. carriers United (UAL.N) and American Airlines. Demand from those airlines is focused in the shorter term, he said, as they swap smaller regional jets for larger, more efficient planes after loosening their pilot contracts.

262,UTX,"Pentagon, industry seek answers on issue that grounded F-35B","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pentagon and industry officials worked through the weekend to determine what caused the failure of a fuel line on the Marine Corps version of Lockheed Martin Corp’s s (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet that prompted the plane’s grounding on Friday. A spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) that builds the engines for the jets, said those involved included officials from Stratoflex, a unit of Parker Hannifin Corp (PH.N) that built the fuel line. No comment was immediately available from Stratoflex. Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon’s F-35 program office, said on Tuesday it was too soon to say when the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) model of the radar-evading new jet could return to flight, since the investigation was continuing. “We’ll return the STOVL variant to flight once any causal and contributing factors are understood and mitigated,” he said. The Pentagon’s F-35 program office announced the grounding of all 25 F-35B model jets on Friday after a fuel line associated with the B-model’s exhaust system failed prior to takeoff during a training flight. The fuel line in question enables movement of the exhaust system, a weight-saving innovation that replaces traditional hydraulics. The incident came just days after the Pentagon’s director of testing and evaluation released an 18-page report detailing an array of problems which he said underscored the “lack of maturity” of the $396 billion fighter program. A team of experts first examined the failed part at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, where the incident occurred during a training flight on January 16, and then headed to the East Hartford, Connecticut plant where Pratt & Whitney builds engines for the jets. DellaVedova said it was unclear if the incident would have any impact on the busy flight test schedule for the new warplane, but said a recent restructuring of the program had added time to the schedule to address any issues that arose during testing. “We now have a program that has resiliency built into it,” DellaVedova said. “That was the whole point of the rebaselining.” Matthew Bates, spokesman for Pratt & Whitney’s military engines division, said investigators worked “diligently” through the holiday weekend, along with officials from Stratoflex. Lockheed is building three different models of the F-35 fighter jet for the U.S. military and eight countries that helped pay for its development: Britain, Canada, Italy, Turkey, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia and Norway. The Pentagon plans to buy 2,443 of the warplanes in coming decades, although many analysts believe U.S. budget constraints and deficits will eventually reduce that overall number.

263,UTX,Man Utd buys out BSkyB stake in club's TV channel,"LONDON (Reuters) - Premier League soccer club Manchester United have taken full ownership of their in-house television channel by buying out a minority stake held by pay TV broadcaster BSkyB BSY.L. MUTV was set up as a three-way joint venture in 1998 between the club, BSkyB and commercial broadcaster ITV (ITV.L). United acquired ITV’s stake in 2007 and said the latest deal would allow it control over content and distribution of a channel available in 57 countries. Financial terms were not disclosed. MUTV employs around 60 people and has offices in central Manchester and facilities at the club’s Old Trafford Stadium and training ground. The United channel offers in-depth interviews and archive action from United, who claim to have more than 650 million followers worldwide. It does not show live Premier League games. Media companies invested in a number of top English soccer clubs in the late 1990s, eager to try to tie up content deals that would help drive digital television take-up. BSkyB tried to buy out United in 1999 but the British government blocked the deal on competition grounds. Those ownership ties have largely unravelled in recent years as the 20 Premier League clubs have opted to sell their television rights collectively to broadcasters including BSkyB. United’s Premier League rivals Chelsea bought out BSkyB’s stake in their digital media business last year. United are now owned by the American Glazer family who retained a tight grip on the club after a flotation on the New York Stock Exchange last year.

264,UTX,Manufacturers say demand up after fiscal cliff fight,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. manufacturers sounded a confident note about their expectations for 2013 on Wednesday as fears of the year-end “fiscal cliff” faded into memory. Textron Inc (TXT.N), whose Cessna unit is the world’s biggest maker of corporate jets, laid out an earnings forecast that would represent growth of about 12 percent, while larger peer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), which makes Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners and Sikorsky helicopters among other products, reiterated a projection that its profit would rise about 13 percent. Executives at each company said demand is recovering after a year-end pause in ordering, when customers worried about a budget standoff that could have triggered large spending cuts and higher taxes in the United States. “We probably have had more order activity than we’re used to seeing at the beginning of January,” reflecting orders that had been delayed, Textron Chief Executive Scott Donnelly said on a conference call with analysts. “We’ll see a degree of uncertainty in the jet market as Washington works through its fiscal challenges, but we believe demand will solidify as those uncertainties are reduced.” The Providence, Rhode Island-based company, which also makes Bell helicopters and EZ-Go golf carts, said it expects sales of its Cessna corporate jets to pick up this year. Budget battles continue in Washington even after the White House and Congress averted a possible year-end crisis that economists called the “fiscal cliff” with warnings of another possible recession. But the current battle seems less daunting to executives in the face of other signs of a recovering economy. “What we see in the economy in the U.S. is that the rebound in the housing market is really having a pull-through effect on the rest of the economy,” said Greg Hayes, chief financial officer of United Tech, in an interview. “Commercial construction is coming back. We saw particular strength in North America and Asia, not as much of a story in Europe, as you can imagine. The U.S. housing slump set the 2007-2009 recession in motion and a slow recovery in that market has been one important drag on a long, sluggish recovery. Recent government data have shown a pickup in demand, with a report last week showing housing starts surged to a four-year high in December. Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech, which also produces Pratt & Whitney jet engines, also noted that airlines’ orders for its spare parts had risen in the quarter, reflecting higher rates of travel. “The path gets a little easier,” said Daniel Holland, an equity analyst at Morningstar, who covers United Tech. “If you look at all the pieces, a housing recovery here and in China, and an improving environment for Otis (elevators) in China, they have decent, positive momentum.” U.S. lawmakers were expected to vote on Wednesday to extend by four months the government’s ability to borrow money, effectively suspending rules that allow the nation to borrow no more than $16.4 trillion. Textron and United Tech also have significant defense businesses, and some investors worry that the United States will continue to scale back spending on weapons, such as United Tech’s Black Hawk military helicopters and Textron’s heavy armored vehicles. United Tech stood by its forecast, first issued last month, that called for 2013 earnings to rise about 13 percent to a range of $5.85 to $6.15 per share, with sales up about 12 percent to a range of $64 billion to $65 billion. Textron issued a 2013 forecast that called for profit to rise by about 12 percent to a range of $2.10 to $2.30 per share, with revenue up about 6 percent to $12.9 billion. The results came a few days after General Electric Co (GE.N), the largest U.S. conglomerate, said that it ended 2012 with a record-high order backlog and sounded a confident note on 2013, sending its shares higher on Friday. The manufacturing sector has been one of the better performers this quarter, with 80 percent of the industrial companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX topping analysts' forecasts. That is better than the 68 percent of companies across the index that have beaten estimates. United Tech and Textron shares, each of which had risen roughly 15 percent over the past six months, outpacing the broader U.S. market, were little changed in early trading. United Tech rose 38 cents, less than 1 percent, to $88.85 and Textron gained 2 percent to $27.66. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors will get more news on the sector later this week, when 3M Co (MMM.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) are due to report results.

275,UTX,Faulty F-35 fuel lines to be scanned in U.S. instead of Britain,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Faulty fuel lines blamed for the grounding of the Marine Corps version of the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet will likely undergo third-party inspections in the United States, instead of being sent to England, to save time and money, sources familiar with the program said on Tuesday. The Pentagon on Monday said it found that a fuel line built by Stratoflex, a unit of Parker Hannifin Corp (PH.N), had been improperly crimped. The defect caused the fuel line to detach and fail just before a training flight took off at a Florida Air Force base on January 18. The incident led to the grounding of all 25 Marine Corps versions of the new warplane, raising questions about the program’s ability to keep an aggressive flight test schedule on the $396 billion program. U.S. military officials want all the lines produced by Stratoflex for the F-35 B-model inspected using CT scans since the variance was measured in thousandths of an inch and would not be easily detected otherwise, according to a defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly. CT scans are most commonly used in medical procedures, but can also detect flaws within components. Normally the lines would be inspected at a facility of Britain’s Rolls-Royce Plc RROYC.UL in England, since Stratoflex is a subcontractor to Rolls Royce. But Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and the prime contractor for the overall engine, hope to speed up the process and save money by using third-party CT scanners in Minnesota and Texas, if Pentagon officials certified those sites, the sources said. Rolls builds the lift fan used on the engine of the B-model, which can take off from shorter runways and land like a helicopter. The conventional and carrier versions of the F-35 were not affected because they don’t use the same fuel lines. Some replacement fuel lines are already available and some test pilots could resume flying by the middle of next week, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. “The third-party businesses are helping us to accelerate return to flight, (versus) sending them back to Rolls Royce in the UK,” said Matthew Bates, a spokesman for Pratt & Whitney. A spokesman for Rolls Royce said his company was working closely with the Pentagon’s F-35 joint program office and Pratt & Whitney. Neither Bates nor a spokesman for Rolls-Royce identified the companies that would perform the scans. It also remains unclear who will pay for the additional inspections and the shipping of the fuel lines, since the problem involved faulty manufacturing, not a design flaw or maintenance problems. The statement issued by the Pentagon’s F-35 program office on Monday made it clear that it holds Pratt and Rolls responsible for inadequate quality controls. It said both companies were taking steps to improve their quality assurance and ensure product integrity. Last year, quality issues with a parachute under the pilot’s ejection seat forced the program to suspend ground and flight operations of 15 F-35s. The company responsible for the improperly packed parachutes took a proactive role in resolving the issue, and paying for the additional work. One source familiar with the program said the Pentagon should not be expected to pay for the problems this time either. A spokeswoman for Parker Hannifin said the company, which makes many other components for the aircraft, was working around the clock to support the Pentagon’s investigation. Lockheed is building three different models of the F-35 fighter jet for the U.S. military and eight countries that helped pay for its development: Britain, Canada, Italy, Turkey, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia and Norway. The Pentagon plans to buy 2,443 of the warplanes in coming decades, although many analysts believe U.S. budget constraints and deficits will eventually reduce that overall number.

277,UTX,UPDATE 1-Pratt & Whitney finds engine-test fraud at sibling unit,"March 4 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp Pratt & Whitney jet engine unit has found that another United Tech unit fraudulently tested parts of engines for business jets to reduce the odds of further monitoring, Pratt said on Monday. Pratt said that after receiving a tip from an employee in June 2011, it had reviewed 15 years of tests at the unit, Carmel Forge in Israel, and found “employees had in fact adjusted certain test data to minimize the possibility of further testing.” It said a further internal review of engine parts inspected by Carmel Forge found they were in fact safe and that the scheme had not caused any flight-safety risks. The company’s findings were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Pratt said the unit has changed staff since the fraudulent testing, bought new test equipment and put in place new software controls to ensure future testing would follow normal practices. Carmel Forge inspects a class of engine used on light jets made by Pratt & Whitney’s Canadian arm. This is not the first quality-related concern raised about United Tech units this year. Last month, the Pentagon ordered a week-long grounding of F-35 military jets after a crack was found on a blade in an engine also made by Pratt & Whitney.

281,UTX,United Tech expects to do few M&A; deals in 2013 -CFO,"March 14 (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer United Technologies Corp will likely spend less than the $1 billion it had budgeted for takeover deals in 2013, chief financial officer Greg Hayes said on Thursday. “There is, quite frankly, not much in the pipeline right now from an M&A; standpoint,” Hayes told investors at a meeting in New York. “We’re more focused on execution than acquisitions this year.” The world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners last year closed its largest-ever acquisition, the $16.5 billion takeover of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp. That deal has proved well-timed, with the Hartford, Connecticut-based company, which also makes jet engines, expecting a rebound in demand for spare parts from airlines later this year, Hayes said. United Tech may buy back more shares than the $1 billion worth it had originally planned for, he added. That could help to offset weaker demand from the U.S. military, which is cutting spending as a result of the mandatory budget cuts imposed by the sequester, a deal for $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts that U.S. President Barack Obama and the Republicans that lead the House of Representatives agreed to last year. Outside of defense, Hayes said the U.S. economy was picking up. “The U.S. economy is better and it’s going to continue to get better,” Hayes said in remarks monitored over the internet. The company on Thursday confirmed its full-year profit forecast, which calls for earnings of $5.85 to $6.15 per share, which would represent growth of roughly 13 percent.

283,UTX,Goodrich deal helps United Tech offset defense cuts,"(Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) reported a better-than-expected profit on Tuesday as its purchase of aircraft components maker Goodrich helped offset U.S. defense cuts and weakness across Europe. The defense cuts, part of a massive sequestration program designed to reduce the federal budget, especially hurt its Sikorsky unit, maker of the Black Hawk helicopter, where profit fell 34 percent. United Tech said sequestration could dent 2013 profit by 10 cents per share in the worst-case scenario, and could affect 2014 results. “Sequestration is a reality, but it’s unfolding slowly at this time,” Chief Executive Louis Chenevert said in an interview. “We will understand more what sequestration does as we get to the end of the year.” Sales to the Department of Defense make up roughly 17 percent of United Tech’s revenue. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the biggest weapons supplier to the U.S. military, also warned on Tuesday that sequestration would weigh on its 2013 revenue. United Tech’s first-quarter earnings would not have grown without last year’s $16.5 billion Goodrich acquisition - the largest in the company’s history - as well as a deal to take control of engine maker IAE. Chenevert said both deals were working out better than expected and would help the company meet its goal for 2013 earnings of $5.85 to $6.15 per share. Analysts look for 2013 earnings of $6.11 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “I’m very encouraged by the company on the aerospace front,” he said. The $16.5 billion deal for Goodrich boosted United Tech’s portfolio of wheels, brakes, gyroscopes and other aircraft materials in demand from airlines and aircraft manufacturers. As a result, its UTC Aerospace Systems unit posted a spike in both first-quarter revenue and profit. Orders for Otis elevators, the company’s most profitable unit, jumped 24 percent, largely due to demand from China. Orders for air conditioners and other climate control products rose 5 percent in the same period. New orders, not necessarily the same as revenue, are a key indicator of demand and closely monitored by Wall Street. Demand for commercial heating, vacuum and air conditioning units dropped sharply in Europe. The continent contributes roughly 25 percent of annual sales. “While Europe had some pluses and minuses, it was no surprise,” Chenevert said. “We are seeing it unfold as we expected.” The company said it would cut debt by $2 billion this year, up from a previous goal of $1 billion. Debt fell slightly in the period to $21.57 billion. Greg Hayes, the chief financial officer, said strong cash flow and low interest rates convinced him to cut more debt than previously expected. Some debt assumed during the Goodrich deal is at interest rates around 6 percent, far higher than market rates, and was worth paying down quickly, Hayes said. “I’ve got cash sitting here that’s earning nothing,” he said in an interview. “Quite frankly it just makes sense for us to pay down some of that legacy Goodrich debt.” The move should save United Tech about $15 million in interest payments this year and $30 million next year, he said. United Tech posted first-quarter profit of $1.27 billion, or $1.39 per share, compared with $330 million, or $1.31 per share, in the year-earlier period. The year-before figures included a one-time charge for discontinued operations. Analysts expected first-quarter earnings of $1.30 per share. Revenue rose 16 percent to $14.39 billion, but missed the $14.94 billion estimate from Wall Street. The strong profit was a positive for Wall Street, but the revenue miss suggested the company was relying too much on cost cuts rather than higher sales. United Tech stood by its forecast for 2013 earnings of $5.85 to $6.15 per share and 2013 revenue of $64 billion to $65 billion. Shares of United Tech fell nearly 1 percent to $92.72 in morning trading. The stock has gained nearly 14 percent so far this year.

289,UTX,"UPDATE 1-U.S. clears GenCorp, Rocketdyne deal after Defense Dept request","WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - Aerospace company GenCorp Inc has been given U.S. antitrust approval to buy rocket engine manufacturer Rocketdyne at the request of the Defense Department, the Federal Trade Commission said on Monday. The FTC said that it approved the deal, even though it would give GenCorp a monopoly in a certain missile defense segment, because the Department of Defense wanted to see the transaction go forward. United Technologies Corp agreed to sell the  Rocketdyne space unit to GenCorp Inc last July for $550 million. The FTC had said in a June 3 letter that it had found that the proposed transaction would create a monopoly in the market for very high-performance, small pressure-fed liquid propulsion systems called “liquid divert and attitude control systems,” which are used in missile defense interceptors. The Department of Defense, however, urged against stopping the deal, saying that the inputs were critical to the nation’s missile defense. It urged the FTC to allow the deal because of “highly unusual national security circumstances,” according to a letter to the FTC dated June 6. Rocketdyne, the world’s largest manufacturer of liquid-fueled rocket propulsion systems, was one of three units United Technologies Chief Executive Louis Chenevert put on the block in an effort to fund the $16.5 billion takeover of Goodrich Corp in 2012. United Technologies sold Rocketdyne for $150 million less than it paid for it more than seven years ago.

290,UTX,AIRSHOW-UPDATE 2-Pratt sees deal for F-35 engines in next 30 days,"* Pratt sees savings of less than 10 pct on next F-35 engine * F-35 engine sales seen exceeding $2 bln a year by 2018 By Andrea Shalal-Esa PARIS, June 16 (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, expects to reach an agreement with the Pentagon within the next 30 days on a contract for engines to power a sixth batch of F-35 fighter jets, Pratt President David Hess told Reuters. Hess said negotiations were still under way with the U.S.  Department of Defense but he expected the final price of the contract to reflect a cost reduction of less than 10 percent, continuing a trend seen in recent years. Pratt says the cost of the engine has declined 40 percent since the program began in 2001. “We’re making progress there. We’ve gotten an offer from the (Joint Program Office) and I expect we’ll get that closed pretty quickly ... certainly within 30 days,” Hess told Reuters in an interview ahead of the Paris air show. Hess declined to give details on the projected value of the contract, which analysts expect will exceed $1 billion. The company, which is the sole producer of engines for the single-seat F-35 fighter jet, which is built by Lockheed Martin Corp, finalized a $1 billion deal with the Pentagon in May for a fifth batch of 35 F135 engines. The sixth engine contract currently being negotiated includes 39 engines, according to Pratt & Whitney. Separate contract negotiations for the fifth batch of engines and jets dragged on for nearly a year, but Pentagon and industry officials were hopeful that agreements would be reached far sooner this time. Hess said F-35 engine sales would account for more than 50 percent of the company’s military engine revenue in the coming years, when production ramps up, reaching $2 billion by around 2018. Last year, he said, military engine revenue accounted for about $4 billion of Pratt’s total revenue of $14 billion. Hess said the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which is being developed by Lockheed for three U.S. military services and eight partner countries, was making good progress after several major restructurings in recent years. He said no major issues or concerns were raised during a meeting last week of top Pentagon officials, industry executives and representatives from the eight partner countries: Britain, Canada, Australia, Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, Norway and Denmark. “It was a very upbeat conference,” Hess said, adding, “The international partners seem to have more confidence in the airplane.” He said potential orders from Singapore and South Korea would help expand production in coming years. Both of those competitions looked promising in short-term, Hess said, noting that there could be additional customers for F-35 fighter jets in the Middle East in the future. Israel has agreed to buy 19 F-35 jets, and was expected to order some 20 more. Asked how the U.S. government could maintain Israel’s “qualitative military edge” in the region if Washington sold F-35s to other Middle Eastern countries, Hess said such potential buyers could receive a “different configuration” of the jet. He gave no further details. He said he was also confident that Canada would decide to stick with the F-35 program despite its recent discussions about having a new competition. If the orders did shift to another company, Pratt & Whitney could decide to move some of the industrial base work it is currently doing in Canada, Hess said. “We might reallocate the work elsewhere,” he said, adding that reduced order volumes would likely trigger changes in Canada. Hess said Pratt continued to work on reducing the production and operating costs of the new fighter jets. The company was waiting for a response from the Pentagon to its proposal to implement a fixed-price contract for maintenance of the engines in 2015, four years earlier than planned. Bennett Croswell, head of Pratt’s military engines business, told Reuters that a similar “performance-based logistics program” had saved an estimated $3 billion in costs on the engines that Pratt builds for the C-17 transport plane. The Pentagon has not responded to requests for a comment about Pratt’s proposal. Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bodgan has talked about his plans to open the operation and sustainment aspect of the F-35 program to competition in the future, but no details have emerged about how the government will do that. Hess said he was not worried about losing the lucrative operations and maintenance work on the F135 engine under some future competition. “We’re used to competing,” he said. “It’s part of our culture.”",6162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/airshow-unitedtechnologies-fighters/airshow-update-2-pratt-sees-deal-for-f-35-engines-in-next-30-days-idUSL5N0ES0D620130616

292,UTX,UPDATE 1-United Technologies told to pay $473 mln to U.S. in lawsuit,"By Nate Raymond June 18 (Reuters) - A federal judge has ordered United Technologies Corp to pay $473 million plus interest for manipulating costs to win U.S. Air Force jet engine contracts in the 1980s. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Thomas Rose in Dayton, Ohio, was issued on Monday for a 1999 lawsuit in which the Department of Justice sought reimbursement for overcharges by United Technologies subsidiary Pratt & Whitney. Interest on the award could “be a couple or few hundred million dollars,” said Christian Mayes, an analyst at Edward Jones. Rates ranged from 6 percent to 8 percent a year and would go back as far as 1986, the ruling said. Ian Race, a spokesman for United Technologies, said the company would appeal. “We strongly disagree with the court’s opinion concerning the Fighter Engine Campaign from the 1980s,” Race said in a statement on Tuesday. Representatives for the Justice Department did not respond to requests for a comment. Rose found United Technologies liable in 2008 under the False Claims Act, a Civil War-era law that allows the federal government to seek reimbursement from companies that submit inflated claims for payment. At that time, the judge awarded the U.S. government $7.09 million in civil penalties but found it suffered no actual damages during the period in question thanks to price concessions from Pratt & Whitney. He also found that administrative proceedings before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals had precluded the Justice Department from pursuing the claims of breach of contract, payment by mistake and unjust enrichment. In November 2010, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the liability finding but sent the case back to Rose to determine damages, ultimately leading to Monday’s ruling. “The government should not have paid the amounts that the government proved it paid as a direct result of United Technologies’ fraud,” Rose wrote. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission following the close of trading on Tuesday, United Technologies said it expected the Justice Department would continue to seek a total judgment of $660 million, including interest. United Technologies said a government victory could materially hurt its operating results. The company posted net income last year of $5.13 billion. “Should the government ultimately prevail, the outcome of this matter could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid,” United Technologies said in its filing. United Technologies shares closed Tuesday up $1.19 at $96.17 on the New York Stock Exchange. The case is U.S. v.

294,UTX,United Technologies told to pay $473 mln to U.S. in lawsuit,"June 18 (Reuters) - A federal judge has ordered United Technologies Corp to pay $473 million plus interest for manipulating costs to win U.S. Air Force jet engine contracts in the 1980s. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Thomas Rose in Dayton, Ohio, was issued Monday for a 1999 lawsuit in which the Department of Justice sought reimbursement for overcharges by United Technologies subsidiary Pratt & Whitney. Interest on parts of the award, with rates ranging from 6 percent to 8 percent a year and dating as far back as 1986, could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the judgment. Ian Race, a spokesman for United Technologies, said the company would appeal. “We strongly disagree with the court’s opinion concerning the Fighter Engine Campaign from the 1980s,” Race said in a statement.

295,UTX,AIRSHOW-U.S. arms companies see rising foreign demand,"PARIS, June 18 (Reuters) - U.S. arms makers see rising foreign demand for fighter jets, missile defense systems and other weapons as countries modernise their forces and U.S. officials, facing tighter budgets, encourage allies to invest more in intelligence gathering and aerial refueling equipment. U.S. Air Force arms sales to international buyers doubled over the past two years and further increases are likely, a senior Air Force official said at the Paris air show on Monday. The annual Paris gathering - celebrating its 50th anniversary this year - has been dominated by the yearly scramble by Boeing Co and Airbus for commercial airplane orders, while the participation of U.S. military aircraft was prevented by across-the-board budget cuts. But in meeting rooms and receptions across Paris and the Le Bourget airfield, U.S. executives and government officials say they can barely keep up with demand for briefings on helicopters, fighter jets, missile defense systems, satellites and unmanned planes. Heidi Grant, deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for international affairs, told Reuters that Air Force arms sales reached about $22 billion in 2012 and could reach or exceed that level in 2013. The Air Force currently oversees 2,800 foreign military sales cases valued at $138 billion in 100 countries, she said. “I see the caseload and the dollars continuing to increase.” William Swanson, chief executive of Raytheon Co, told Reuters in an interview that he and his top executives had planned 162 meetings over the coming days. “We are overbooked.” Raytheon expects its international sales to generate about 30 percent of revenues in coming years, up from around 26 percent now, he said. “We see it from the point of view of growing our business and not shrinking our domestic (revenues) so the international goes up automatically,” Swanson said. Raytheon hopes to conclude negotiations soon with several countries, including Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey for billions of dollars worth of missile defense systems and other equipment, he added. Other U.S. companies including Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, say international sales may soon account for half or more of their annual military aircraft revenues. The Air Force’s Grant, who meets regularly with air defense chiefs from other countries, said mounting pressure on the U.S. defense budget made it more important for U.S. allies to increase their ability to carry out intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, as well as aerial refueling. She said selling U.S. fighter jets and other weapons to U.S. allies laid the groundwork for closer military ties with the United States. She cited strong demand for Boeing’s C-17 transport plane, Lockheed Martin Corp’s C-130J transport, and the MQ-9 Reaper, an unmanned plane built by privately held General Atomics, which is based in San Diego. “When they do choose the U.S. it establishes a 20-plus year relationship with the United States,” Grant told Reuters in her first media interview since moving into the job three years ago. Grant has been actively pressing for a U.S. winner in two multibillion dollar fighter competitions in Brazil and South Korea that are expected to wrap up this summer. Boeing’s F-15 fighter, Lockheed Martin Corp’s F-35 fighter jet and the Eurofighter Typhoon, built by BAE Systems, European aerospace group EADS and Italy’s Finmeccanica SpA , are competing for the South Korea order, which industry executives expect to be awarded in mid-July. In Brazil, Boeing is hoping to sell its F/A-18 Super Hornet in a deal that would mark a significant jump in the security and strategic relationship between the two countries. Chris Raymond, vice president of business development for Boeing’s defense unit, said his company saw good prospects in Brazil for unmanned planes, infrastructure security and even satellites, as well as for fighter jets. Chris Chadwick, president of Boeing’s military aircraft division, also cited strong demand for the company’s helicopters and the V-22 tiltrotor it builds together with Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc. He said the company could also sell 100 to 200 of its KC-46 refueling tankers to international customers in coming years. Lockheed Martin also sees big export opportunities for its new F-35 fighters, as well as its C-130J transport planes, company officials told Reuters. Jack Crisler, vice president of new business for Lockheed’s air mobility, special operations and aeronautics programs, said the company was forecasting 150 to 200 additional C-130J sales over the next decade. Steve O’Bryan, vice president of Lockheed’s F-35 program, said he was upbeat on the fighter jet’s prospects in the South Korea competition, and in Canada and Denmark, which helped to fund the plane’s development but are re-examining their options. “International is becoming a larger and larger part of Lockheed’s overall business,” he told Reuters in an interview.

Grant said she expected Air Force arms sales to remain around $10 billion in the foreseeable future.

Biotech and tech shares weighed on the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq, with the S&P; biotech subindex falling 1.8 percent a day after hitting an all-time high. The S&P; consumer staples index slipped 0.2 percent and ranked among the worst performers of the benchmark index’s 10 industrial sectors. Shares of United Technologies, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, hit an all-time intraday high of $105.63 after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised the low end of its 2013 earnings forecast. In late afternoon trading, the stock was up 3 percent at $105.16. Shortly after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed to an intraday record high of 15,604.22, while the S&P; 500 reached an all-time intraday high of 1,698.78. Tuesday’s trading was marked by an extremely tight range, with the Dow traveling only 60.16 points from its session low to its intraday high. The S&P; 500 moved just 7.65 points from its record intraday high to its session low. “Right now with the market moving sideways in a very tight range, that’s a very healthy scenario,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. “We’ve got a nice move up, and the market’s simply pausing to digest that move and waiting for another catalyst to send stocks to new high ground or to pull back a little bit.” If the S&P; 500 ends Tuesday’s session with a decline, it would be only the second down day in the last 14 for the benchmark index. The S&P; 500 has gained nearly 19 percent so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 45.63 points, or 0.29 percent, to 15,591.18. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  edged down just 0.46 of a point, or 0.03 percent, to 1,695.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 12.89 points, or 0.36 percent, to 3,587.49. Tech bellwether Apple Inc is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results after the closing bell. Its stock, however, is not expected to show a big swing after the earnings. This could mean investors are under-hedged in case the company delivers a shock. The options market is pricing in a potential move up or down of 4 percent to almost 5 percent in Apple’s stock price following the results - in line with a historic average move of about 4.3 percent to 4.4 percent over the past four quarters. Apple’s stock was down 1.2 percent at $421.30 in late afternoon trading, making it the biggest drag on both the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500. Of the 130 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings so far this season, 63.8 percent have beaten analysts’ expectations, but 51.5 percent have fallen short of revenue forecasts. Over the past four quarters, 67 percent of companies have beaten earnings estimates. Netflix Inc shares dropped 4.4 percent to $250.50 a day after the movies and TV streaming service reported it had gained new subscribers in the second quarter. The number of new subscribers, though, was not enough to impress investors. Elsewhere in the tech sector, Cisco Systems said it will buy software maker Sourcefire Inc for about $2.7 billion to increase its network security services. Sourcefire shares surged 27.8 percent to $75.49. In comparison, Cisco’s stock was down 0.3 percent at $25.64. Shares of Phillips 66 Partners shot up 30.8 percent to $30.08 in their first day of trading. The initial public offering of 16.4 million shares was priced at $23 per share.

300,UTX,Lockheed hopes for next Pentagon deal on F-35 jets soon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Co is making “good progress” in negotiations with the Pentagon about the next two batches of F-35 fighter jets and hopes to reach agreement soon, Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said on Tuesday. Lockheed is building three models of the F-35 for the U.S. military and eight international partner countries: Britain, Australia, Canada, Norway, Turkey, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands. Israel and Japan have also ordered the jet. After protracted and difficult discussions on the previous order of F-35 jets, Pentagon officials had hoped to reach agreement with Lockheed around mid-year on the sixth and seventh orders, valued at multiple billions of dollars. Air Force Lieutentant General Christopher Bogdan told company officials he wanted to reach agreement on the contracts by the end of July, according to industry sources. It may take some time afterward to finalize and sign the agreements. The total number of jets involved is 71, with 36 planes to be purchased in the sixth production lot, and 35 in the seventh, said Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon’s F-35 office. He said that number includes 60 F-35s for the U.S. military, and 11 for Australia, Italy, Turkey and Britain. “We’ve been very open and transparent with our data and I think the negotiations are going well,” Hewson told reporters after the company reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings. “We’ve making good progress and we hope that we’ll be able to close in the near term,” she said, also citing strong Pentagon and international support for the F-35 program, despite U.S. budget cuts. She told analysts the program racked up some big accomplishments in the second quarter, including completion of high-angle attack testing, and forecasts by the military services for when they will start using the new jets. “You can feel the momentum accelerating throughout the program,” she said, adding that Lockheed delivered 12 jets in the second quarter and expected to deliver 36 in the full year. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner told analysts the F-35 program accounted for about 15 percent of Lockheed’s revenues, and that percentage would grow in coming years. He said the two F-35 production deals would add $4.5 billion to $5 billion to the company’s order books when they were completed, a move he said he expected in the third quarter. That amount comes on top of long-lead funding Lockheed has already received for the jets. DellaVedova declined to predict when an agreement could be reached but said the two sides were making progress. The F-35 is the Pentagon’s biggest weapons program, and officials have been pushing for lower prices to ensure the program’s future given mounting budget pressures and mandatory budget cuts that could cut the Pentagon’s budget by $500 billion over the next decade. Tanner told analysts that Lockheed adjusted downward its second-quarter results by $85 million to reflect lower expected incentive fees on the remainder of the F-35 development contract. It made a similar adjustment last year. Tanner said the adjustment was “a little tougher maybe than what we were thinking” but the company was earning higher single digit margins on the F-35 production contracts, and should get into double digit profits when the program gets to full productions in coming years. The Pentagon reached agreement with Lockheed on the fifth batch of F-35s last December, agreeing to buy 32 of the advanced warplanes for $3.8 billion. The U.S. government is negotiating separately with United Technologies Corp unit Pratt & Whitney to buy engines for the sixth batch of jets. Pratt’s CEO Dave Hess told Reuters in June he expected a deal within the next 30 days. A Pratt & Whitney spokesman had no immediate comment.

302,UTX,"Bullish on aerospace, United Tech lifts 2013 forecast","(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, raised the bottom end of its 2013 earnings forecast on Tuesday, citing its growing confidence after a jump in aerospace orders and cost cuts. However, the conglomerate, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Black Hawk helicopters, said revenue would be at the lower end of its forecast of $64 billion to $65 billion for this year. Executives said the onus was on them to turn United Tech’s burgeoning order book into revenue, a challenge they said was achievable. “We’ve got to see 6 percent (revenue) growth in the back half of the year, and that’s a challenge,” Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said in an interview. “But we have the orders, and that gives us confidence.” Orders for large commercial engine parts rose 65 percent in the second quarter, largely because of last year’s $16.5 billion acquisition of parts maker Goodrich, the largest in United Tech’s history. The buyout, though criticized as expensive at the time, has helped United Tech become the preeminent supplier of parts to aerospace customers, offering a suite of services previously supplied by many rivals. Roughly 65 percent of an airplane’s components now come from United Tech, estimates William Blair & Co analyst Nick Heymann. The rise in miles flown by airlines around the world has caused demand for spare parts to grow, boosting United Tech’s profit. “The recovery in the global economy is creating nice opportunities for us to deliver,” Chief Executive Officer Louis Chenevert told Reuters. “Things are improving.” While cost cuts do factor into the new earnings forecast, Wall Street has largely focused on the growing aerospace market share, sending United Tech stock up 25 percent so far this year. Shares of United Tech rose 2 percent to $104.17 in morning trading. “The big thing for me was the jump in orders for replacement parts for engines,” said Edward Jones analyst Christian Hayes. “That’s a very profitable business.” The company gained an edge last week when rival General Electric Co won U.S. antitrust approval for its $4.3 billion buyout of Avio’s aviation business only by promising not to interfere with the Italian plane component maker’s development of a key engine component for United Tech. The agreement, which allows United Tech to place staff at the Avio facility once the merger closes, effectively means GE will be building a key part for one of United Tech’s jet engines. Orders in China for Otis elevators rose 39 percent in the second quarter, helped by expansion of cities in the country’s central and western regions. “It’s a very robust market, and there’s plenty of work for all the big players to be happy,” Chenevert said. United Tech posted second-quarter income of $1.56 billion, or $1.70 per share, compared with $1.33 billion, or $1.62 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.57 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 16 percent to $16 billion. Analysts expected $16.37 billion. United Tech raised the low end of its 2013 earnings forecast to $6.00 a share from $5.85 while keeping the high end at $6.15. Wall Street expects 2013 profit of $6.11 per share. United Tech also raised its cost cut estimate for 2013 to $450 million from $350 million. Most of the cost cuts are layoffs across United Tech’s various businesses. Last week, for instance, 575 employees at the Pratt & Whitney unit took buyout packages.

With earnings season in full swing, Apple Inc is due to report after the closing bell. The tech giant is expected to post a smaller quarterly profit and its financial report may come under intense scrutiny. The stock was down 0.3 percent at $425.31 in early trade. Chemical maker DuPont Co, a Dow component, said it was looking to sell or spin off its performance chemicals unit to insulate itself from flagging sales of paint pigments that have weighed on profits. The stock jumped 4.7 percent to $59.91. United Technologies Corp, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, raised the bottom end of its 2013 earnings forecast, citing its growing confidence after a jump in aerospace orders and cost cuts. The stock rose 2.4 percent to $104.72. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 44.08 points, or 0.28 percent, at 15,589.63. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 1.80 points, or 0.11 percent, at 1,697.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 3.23 points, or 0.09 percent, at 3,603.62. Wall Street has moved higher in 11 of the past 12 market days. The S&P; 500 closed at a third straight all-time high on Monday, and is now up about 20 percent for the year. “Could the upward run continue? Yes,” said David Brown, CEO at Sabrient Systems, an independent equity research firm in Santa Barbara, California. “Funds continue to flow from money market and longer-term fixed income funds into the equity market. Valuations have not exceeded reasonable variations from the norm, a tad high here and there but with bargains remaining. The gains have not been powerful, large up days on large volume indicating a blow-off top.” Among the day’s decliners, Netflix Inc shares fell 1.1 percent to $259.15, a day after the online-entertainment firm reported that its show “Arrested Development” lured new subscribers in the second quarter but not enough to impress investors. United Parcel Service Inc posted a smaller quarterly profit as customers chose slower, cheaper shipping services, especially on international routes. The stock fell 0.1 percent to $87.49. China must deepen reforms to address a slew of challenges confronting it, President Xi Jinping said in comments published on Tuesday that emphasize the government’s determination to restructure the slowing economy.

304,UTX,"UPDATE 3-Bullish on aerospace, United Tech lifts 2013 forecast","By Ernest Scheyder July 23 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, raised the bottom end of its 2013 earnings forecast on Tuesday, citing its growing confidence after a jump in aerospace orders and cost cuts. However, the conglomerate, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Black Hawk helicopters, said revenue would be at the lower end of its forecast of $64 billion to $65 billion for this year. Executives said the onus was on them to turn United Tech’s burgeoning order book into revenue, a challenge they said was achievable. “We’ve got to see 6 percent (revenue) growth in the back half of the year, and that’s a challenge,” Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said in an interview. “But we have the orders, and that gives us confidence.” Orders for large commercial engine parts rose 65 percent in the second quarter, largely because of last year’s $16.5 billion acquisition of parts maker Goodrich, the largest in United Tech’s history. The buyout, though criticized as expensive at the time, has helped United Tech become the preeminent supplier of parts to aerospace customers, offering a suite of services previously supplied by many rivals. Roughly 65 percent of an airplane’s components now come from United Tech, estimates William Blair & Co analyst Nick Heymann. The rise in miles flown by airlines around the world has caused demand for spare parts to grow, boosting United Tech’s profit. “The recovery in the global economy is creating nice opportunities for us to deliver,” Chief Executive Officer Louis Chenevert told Reuters. “Things are improving.” While cost cuts do factor into the new earnings forecast, Wall Street has largely focused on the growing aerospace market share, sending United Tech stock up 25 percent so far this year. Shares of United Tech rose 2 percent to $104.17 in morning trading. “The big thing for me was the jump in orders for replacement parts for engines,” said Edward Jones analyst Christian Hayes. “That’s a very profitable business.” The company gained an edge last week when rival General Electric Co  won U.S. antitrust approval for its $4.3 billion buyout of Avio’s aviation business only by promising not to interfere with the Italian plane component maker’s development of a key engine component for United Tech. The agreement, which allows United Tech to place staff at the Avio facility once the merger closes, effectively means GE will be building a key part for one of United Tech’s jet engines. Orders in China for Otis elevators rose 39 percent in the second quarter, helped by expansion of cities in the country’s centreal and western regions. “It’s a very robust market, and there’s plenty of work for all the big players to be happy,” Chenevert said. United Tech posted second-quarter income of $1.56 billion, or $1.70 per share, compared with $1.33 billion, or $1.62 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.57 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 16 percent to $16 billion. Analysts expected $16.37 billion. United Tech raised the low end of its 2013 earnings forecast to $6.00 a share from $5.85 while keeping the high end at $6.15. Wall Street expects 2013 profit of $6.11 per share. United Tech also raised its cost cut estimate for 2013 to $450 million from $350 million. Most of the cost cuts are layoffs across United Tech’s various businesses. Last week, for instance, 575 employees at the Pratt & Whitney unit took buyout packages. United Tech said that because some new jet engine projects would not launch until at least 2015, the company needed to cut costs now.",7232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/unitedtech-results/update-3-bullish-on-aerospace-united-tech-lifts-2013-forecast-idUSL1N0FT0BD20130723

306,UTX,"UPDATE 2-India auditor says wrongdoing in Italy chopper deal, piles pressure on govt","By Anurag Kotoky NEW DELHI, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Indian negotiators set a higher base price for the purchase of helicopters from AgustaWestland and frequently changed the bidding rules, the federal auditor said on Tuesday, making it harder for the government to complete the 560 million euro ($744.43 million) deal. The ruling Congress is battling allegations of widespread corruption in government and the latest report into the deal to buy 12 helicopters for top politicians offers further ammunition to its opponents in the run-up to general elections next year. The Comptroller and Auditor General said the defence ministry did not comply with rules from the very beginning of the tender process to the conclusion of the contract with  AgustaWestland, a division of Italy’s Finmeccanica  defence group. Italy and India are separately investigating charges that AgustaWestland paid bribes to win the 2010 deal for the AW101 helicopters. India froze payments to the company in February as the scandal unfolded. It had taken delivery of three helicopters before the deal was stalled. The auditor said the defence ministry had initially set a condition that the helicopters should be able to fly to an altitude of 6,000 metres, which meant that AgustaWestland could not compete since the AW101 was certified to fly only to 4,572 metres. Later the minimum altitude requirement was lowered to 4,500 metres, even though the helicopters were expected to be used in the mountainous north and northeast parts of the country where the altitudes are higher, it said. Field trials of AgustaWestland’s bid were conducted on representative helicopters Merlin MK-3A and Civ-01 and on a mock-up of the passenger cabin, and not on the actual helicopter, the CAG said. In contrast, the actual S-92 helicopters offered by rival  bidder Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp , were evaluated, the report said. Bruno Spagnolini, former CEO of AgustaWestland, and Giuseppe Orsi, former chairman of Finmeccanica, are being tried in Italy on the accusations in the Indian deal. Both deny wrongdoing. The Italian arrest warrant for Orsi and Spagnolini, seen by Reuters, said the Indian tender was changed to deliberately favour the Italian firm. “The benchmarked cost adopted by the contract negotiating committee was unreasonably high compared to the offer cost,” the auditor said. “Hence it provided no realistic basis for obtaining an assurance about the reasonableness of the cost of procurement of AW101 helicopters,” it added. There was no immediate comment from the defence ministry to the auditor’s report and military analysts in India and abroad said that New Delhi was likely to wait for the results of a federal police investigation before making a decision on the deal. “CAG’s assessments on the chopper deal will most probably be factored into the current investigation, but to conclude that either AugustaWestland will be blacklisted or the VVIP chopper tender will be cancelled seems a little premature at the moment,” said Deba Mohanty, chairman of Indicia Research & Advisory, a New Delhi-based think tank. AgustaWestland has denied any bribery and asked India to pay the sums due under the contract, sources said earlier this year. A source familiar with the company’s position said AgustaWestland told the India’s finance ministry in a letter that its initial contract with the Indian government was still valid and India was liable to pay the remaining amount because the allegations had not been proved. “The most prudent thing for India to do is to complete all relevant investigations - including the CBI inquiry - and to make a decision based on these findings,” said  Jon Grevatt, Asia Pacific Defence Industry Analyst at IHS Jane’s.",8132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/india-agustawestland/update-2-india-auditor-says-wrongdoing-in-italy-chopper-deal-piles-pressure-on-govt-idUSL4N0GE1JN20130813
307,UTX,United Technologies responsible for faulty Dreamliner fire extinguishers,"Aug 16 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp on Friday said one of its units was responsible for a problem with fire-fighting systems discovered in some Boeing Co  Dreamliner jets. Japanese airline ANA Holdings said on Wednesday that it had found an electrical wiring problem in the fire extinguishers of the engines on three Boeing 787s. An assembly error at its service center impacted some refurbished fire extinguisher bottles, a United Technologies spokesman said in an email. “This error has been corrected and we are working with Boeing and the airlines to complete the necessary inspections, which we expect will be completed over the next few days.” Japan Airlines Co Ltd also said on Wednesday that it was inspecting its Dreamliner fleet for similar problems.

308,UTX,"Analysis: Merged American Airlines-US Airways would offer more, could charge more","(Reuters) - For travelers, the question of whether to let American Airlines and US Airways merge into the world’s largest carrier may boil down to this: pay more and get more, or pay less and get less. A new mega-airline, with the American brand name, would have more flights on more routes and could charge higher ticket prices on at least some. This would appeal to business travelers who generally favor convenience and comfort over price. If the airlines don’t merge, they might offer lower prices, but could ultimately be forced to cut routes or go out of business as they try to compete with much larger United and Delta, themselves the products of mega-mergers over the last few years. Business travelers, who spend two or three times as much as those flying for fun, are likely to lose out if the merger fails, since there would be no third alternative to the large domestic and international route networks offered by United and Delta. “If you’re a corporate traveler, you’re basically going to be faced with two stalwart airlines, Delta and United, and you’ll have actually less choice at the corporate level than you did if this merger would occur,” said Andrew Davis, an investment analyst with T. Rowe Price, which owns airline shares. The merger “certainly was not looked at from that perspective” by the government, Davis said. The U.S. Justice Department sued on Tuesday to block the $11 billion merger on antitrust grounds, arguing that allowing the fourth large U.S. airline merger in five years could lead to higher ticket prices and fewer choices for consumers. The merger “would likely substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly,” the government complaint said. The airlines are girding for a court fight, saying their bid to create the world’s largest airline will provide a rival to challenge mega-airlines United and Delta, giving customers more choice. The American-US Airways LCC.N merger would cap a wave of consolidation that has helped return the industry to modest profitability after the 2008-09 economic downturn. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) acquired Northwest in 2008, United Continental (UAL.N) was formed in 2010 and Southwest (LUV.N) bought rival AirTran in 2011. Southwest and other smaller airlines use a different business model, offering many direct domestic flights rather than hub-and-spoke connecting service. U.S. government data show that on an inflation-adjusted basis, average air fares are lower than they were 15 years ago but have moved up modestly since 2007, largely due to a more than 40 percent rise in fuel costs over the last six years. “This has not been skyway robbery,” George Hobica, president of AirfareWatchdog, an airfare alert and travel advice service, said of rising air fares. But airlines also have added charges for baggage, food and other services, making it more difficult to say whether travelers are better off over all. U.S. airlines as a group had a third straight year of profitability in 2012, but earnings have declined since 2010, according to data from the U.S. trade group Airlines for America. Industry margins have shrunk from 1.6 percent in 2010 to 0.2 percent last year, the data show. “Airlines are still making pitiful profits compared with other industries,” Hobica said. Continued expansion by carriers like JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines would be good for the market, he added. While he didn’t necessarily see huge consumer benefits if American and US Airways merged, he said the combination would benefit both carriers financially and ultimately make for happier passengers. “I think the benefit to consumers is that they’ll be flying in newer planes and we won’t see another bankruptcy,” Hobica said. Airline analysts and consultants said the DOJ complaint reflected government misunderstanding of how the industry operates and how it has changed. American Airlines, the No. 1 U.S. carrier before the spate of mergers, is now the third-biggest behind United and Delta. The Justice Department contended that American and US Airways, the fifth-largest U.S. carrier, have posted improved financial results and can survive as independent carriers. Robert Mann, an airline consultant in Port Washington, New York, responded that without the merger, American could ultimately be squeezed out of getting more business accounts. “You get corporate accounts chiefly because you have the best network,” Mann said. Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst at Hudson Crossing LLC, a consulting firm in San Francisco, said the government failed to consider upcoming changes in the competitive landscape. For example, Southwest will be able to launch new nonstop flights to New York, Los Angeles and other cities from its base of Dallas Love Field next year when the Wright Amendment, a federal law introduced in the 1970s, expires. The Justice Department also contended in its lawsuit that American and US Airways could survive as independent airlines. But industry analysts said customers of American and US Airways would suffer over the longer term as the airlines are unable to invest in new products and services at the same level as their merged peers. Delta, buoyed by its merger, has spent the last two years and billions of dollars upgrading plane seats, airport facilities and technology systems that have helped it run a more reliable operation. “The facts are that Delta, United and Southwest ... have now become so large and so financially strong that it is pure fantasy to suggest that either American and/or US Airways will be competitive as standalone airlines,” Robert Herbst, an independent airline consultant and former pilot, said in a report this week. For American parent AMR Corp, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2011, a blocked merger would also put its restructuring back at square one, requiring the carrier to come up with new strategies to grow and pay back creditors [ID:nL2N0GG10M]. Jan Brueckner, a professor of economics at the University of California-Irvine who studies airlines, took issue with the view that fares will go up under a merger. “Our work shows that legacy mergers don’t generate large fare effects,” Brueckner said. “The benefits of mergers - larger networks, greater ease in going places - probably dominate in determining the outcome.” Brueckner, an American Airlines frequent flyer, said he was excited that the American merger would offer new destinations. “I was looking forward to my airline being the world’s biggest and getting me to more places that I need to go, especially overseas,” he said.

309,UTX,"Exclusive: United Tech, Pentagon in $1 billion-plus deal for F-35 engines","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, has reached an agreement in principle with the Pentagon on a contract to build 39 engines for a sixth batch of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, three sources familiar with the deal said on Monday. The agreement - which Pratt had expected to reach over a month ago - is valued at more than $1 billion, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The Pentagon agreed on the terms of a contract for the sixth and seventh orders of F-35s with Lockheed Martin Corp, which builds the jets, in late July. The government buys the engines separately from Pratt & Whitney, which is the sole producer of engines for the radar-evading warplane. The negotiations between Pratt and the Pentagon’s F-35 program office had focused only on engines for the sixth batch, with separate discussions planned for a seventh batch of F135 engines. Pratt President Dave Hess had told Reuters in June that he expected to reach a deal with the Pentagon within 30 days on the next engine contract, reflecting a cost reduction of less than 10 percent. No further details were immediately available about the new agreement in principle, which the sources said was reached by Pratt and government officials last week but which has yet to be announced. Officials at Pratt and the Pentagon’s F-35 program office had no immediate comment on the deal, whose terms will now be finalized in coming weeks and months. Pratt has said the cost of the F135 engine it builds for the F-35 fighters is down about 40 percent from 2001, when the program began. The company finalized a $1 billion deal for a fifth batch of 35 engines with the Pentagon in May. The sixth engine contract includes 39 engines - 36 for F-35 planes and three spares, according to Pratt & Whitney. Hess told Reuters in June that F-35 engine sales would account for more than 50 percent of the company’s military engine revenue in coming years, when production ramps up, reaching $2 billion by around 2018. Hess said that last year, military engine revenue accounted for about $4 billion of Pratt’s total revenue of $14 billion.

Durable goods orders dropped 7.3 percent in July, the biggest decline in nearly a year. In addition, a gauge of planned business spending on capital goods tumbled, casting a shadow over the economy early in the third quarter. The reports and other data for July have suggested economic growth this quarter will probably not accelerate as much as economists had hoped. Investors were heartened because the Fed has said any  decision to slow its $85 billion a month in bond purchases, which has helped drive the S&P; 500 index’s rise of nearly 17 percent this year, depends on a recovering economy. “Clearly the durable goods number, particularly if you dig down in there, was not encouraging,” said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York. “If there is anything that is driving the markets today, it is that the durable goods numbers were weaker than expected and that raises the question the Federal Reserve might not begin to taper.” The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield hit its lowest in a week following the data. A recent spike in yields has raised concerns that mortgage rates and consumer credit will climb too high and harm the economy’s recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.41 points or 0.2 percent, to 15,039.92, the S&P; 500 gained 4.31 points or 0.26 percent, to 1,667.81 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 22.747 points or 0.62 percent, to 3,680.539. Amgen Inc was the biggest boost to both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes after it struck a deal to buy cancer drug maker Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $10.4 billion, sweetening its original offer made in June. Onyx shares rose 5.7 percent to $123.62 and Amgen jumped 9 percent to $115.12. The NYSEArca biotech index climbed 2.4 percent.

312,UTX,"Pentagon, United Technology agree on F-35 engines","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Tuesday announced it had reached agreement with United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) to build 38 engines for a sixth batch of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jets, securing discounts of 2.5 percent to 9.6 percent on the engines. Pratt & Whitney, the engine-making unit of United Technologies, said it is targeting further cost reductions on the next two batches of engines under contracts that will be negotiated with the Pentagon in coming months. The Defense Department did not disclose the value of the deal, which was first reported by Reuters on Monday, but sources close to the matter said it would be worth over $1 billion. Mandatory budget cuts have prompted U.S. military officials and weapons makers to focus increasingly on cutting costs so they can ensure the continuation of big programs like the $392 billion F-35 program, the Pentagon’s costliest weapons program. Chris Flynn, vice president of Pratt & Whitney’s F135 and F119 engine programs, said the company is “laser-focused” on reducing costs, meeting its delivery schedule and reaching contracts quickly for the next two batches of engines. Flynn told Reuters the company hoped to conclude agreements for the seventh and eighth sets of engine orders in the first quarter of 2014. The two orders will be negotiated together. He said the company planned to submit its proposal for those engines by the end of September, including further cost reductions that reflect increasing economies of scale. “We’re starting to see production increase, and you can see some of the benefits of that,” Flynn told Reuters in a telephone interview. He noted that Pratt had already reduced the cost of producing the engines by more than 40 percent since the first engines it built for the program. “We anticipate continued price reductions, as long as we’re able to keep the volume in place,” Flynn said. He said Pratt was in talks with the Pentagon about accelerating moves to fixed-price terms for operations and maintenance of the engines under a performance-based logistics contract, which he said could generate additional savings. The Pentagon’s F-35 program office agreed in late July on the terms of a contract for the sixth and seventh orders of F-35s with Lockheed Martin, which builds the jets. The government buys the engines from Pratt & Whitney and then provides them to Lockheed. Pratt is the sole producer of F135 engines for the radar-evading plane. The latest agreement in principle will be finalized in coming weeks. The Pentagon said the agreement reflected a 2.5 percent reduction in each of the 32 common configuration engines, which power both the Air Force’s conventional take-off variant of the F-35 and the Navy’s carrier variant. The unit prices for the six engines that power the Marine Corps’ short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft, were about 9.6 percent lower compared with the previous contract, according to the statement. “Driving down cost is critical to the success of this program and we are working together - in each successive contract - to lower costs for the propulsion system,” said Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon official who runs the F-35 program. The deal includes 36 engines to be installed in aircraft and two spares. It also includes the first propulsion systems for planes to be sold to Italy and Australia. Pratt & Whitney has delivered 107 production engines for the F-35 to date and will start delivering engines covered by the latest contract in the fourth quarter. The Pentagon announced later on Tuesday that Pratt had won a contract worth $70 million in preliminary funding to start purchasing parts and components for an eighth batch of 29 F135 engines, as well as 10 engines for Britain, Italy and Norway that will be included in the seventh batch. Flynn said the company invested millions of dollars of its own funds to keep the schedule for the sixth batch of engines on track after initial funding provided by the Pentagon ran out.

The contract has been plagued by delays and problems. “The government is considering other options for the maritime helicopter project,” a spokeswoman for federal Public Works Minister Diane Finley said in an e-mailed statement. “We are conducting an analysis of price and availability of other aircrafts manufactured by other vendors.” Canada signed the contract in 2004 for 28 of Sikorsky’s Cyclone helicopters, the first of which was supposed to be delivered by early 2009. The firm, which has so far provided just a handful of Cyclones for training purposes, said earlier this year that some of the delays were caused by major modifications requested by Canada. Finley’s statement made clear Canada had yet to take a final decision on what it will do. Ottawa has already fined Sikorsky almost C$90 million for failure to meet its obligations. The helicopters are due to replace Canada’s creaking fleet of Sea Kings, which first came into service some 50 years ago. A spokesman for Sikorsky said he could not immediately comment.

Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt’s military engines business, told Reuters the company was continuing its “war on costs” by streamlining and improving production, signing more long-term agreements with suppliers, and making changes to drive down long-term operating and maintenance costs. Croswell said Pratt expected to match or beat the 2.5 percent reduction that it achieved on 32 of the 38 engines in a sixth production contract agreed with the Pentagon last month. A Pratt spokesman said there were about 40 engines in each of the next two production lots. Pratt is the sole supplier of F135 engines for all three variants of the F-35 fighter jet built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). Croswell said Pratt expected to submit a proposal to the Pentagon for the seventh and eighth batches of engines by the end of September with an eye to reaching agreement on a contract by the end of the first quarter of 2014. Pratt reached an agreement valued at over $1 billion for 28 engines in a sixth batch last month. Croswell, speaking to Reuters at the annual Air Force Association conference, said Pratt continued to invest heavily to lower the cost of the jet engines that power the radar-evading new fighter jet. “We’ve got to continue to bring the price down lot after lot. That’s absolutely the focus of the team,” Croswell said. “We’re attacking all aspects of cost on the program.” He said the company expected to lower the cost of the common configuration engines that power both the Air Force’s conventional takeoff plane and the Navy’s carrier variant by “2.5 percent ... if not better.” He said Navy acquisition chief Sean Stackley had visited Pratt’s main military engine plant two weeks ago to see improvements in the manufacturing process, including greater automation, Croswell said. For example, one operator could now run three machines that milled titanium or nickel into rotors and compressors at once, which helped lower labor costs. But he said it was critical to maintain volume orders to reap those gains. Pratt also remains in discussions with the Pentagon’s F-35 program office about a proposal to start a fixed-price agreement to service the engines in 2015 or 2016, several years sooner than the 2019 start date now planned. Croswell said the two sides needed to agree on a common baseline for the cost of operating and maintaining the engines before such a deal could be reached. Pratt remained convinced that it would be able to extend the current projected life of the F135 engines, just as it had added about 50 percent to the projected life of its 229 engines over time. Experts that prepare cost estimates for the government were reluctant to include such projected gains in operating and maintenance costs estimates for the engines until those gains were actually demonstrated, Croswell said. He said Pratt’s engines should be integrated into the computer-based logistics system that Lockheed is operating to coordinate servicing and spare parts for the rest of the aircraft by late 2014 or early 2015. That move should result in additional savings on operating costs, Croswell said.

319,UTX,Rolls-Royce and UTC abandon aero engine partnership,"LONDON (Reuters) - British aero engine maker Rolls-Royce (RR.L) and United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) have abandoned plans to form a partnership to develop engines for mid-size aircraft, the two firms said on Thursday. In October 2011 Rolls and U.S. engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of UTC, announced plans to form a partnership to develop engines for 120-230 seat passenger aircraft that in future years would replace new, revamped versions of the Airbus EAD.PA A320 and Boeing (BA.N) 737 narrow-body planes. However, on Thursday the two firms said following discussions, they had decided not to proceed with the partnership “because of the current regulatory environment”. “The two companies entered into the venture in good faith but there are very few players in this area of the market and UTC and Rolls-Royce felt competition bodies in a number of jurisdictions would have made moving ahead with the partnership complicated,” said a source close to the two firms. Pratt and Rolls planned to hold an equal share in the venture, which was intended to study geared turbofan and open rotor technology along with other types of engine configurations. When the tie up was announced, analysts believed the move had resolved a spat between the two companies who are the dominant players in the market for aircraft engines along with General Electric (GE.N). “Rolls-Royce remains fully committed to this important market segment and will continue to invest in technologies that will enable us to take advantage of opportunities as they arise,” the British company said. Rolls-Royce shares in London closed 1.5 percent higher at 1111.5 pence, while UTX stock in New York was 1 percent higher at $112.1 by 1545 GMT.

324,UTX,"UPDATE 1-U.S. companies warn of delays, furloughs from shutdown","By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. government shutdown is beginning to hit the factory floor, with major manufacturers like Boeing Co and United Technologies Corp  warning of delays and employee furloughs in the thousands if the budget impasse persists. Companies that rely on federal workers to inspect and approve their products or on government money to fund their operations said they are preparing to slow or stop work if the first government shutdown in 17 years continues into next week. United Technologies said nearly 2,000 workers in its Sikorsky Aircraft division, which makes the Black Hawk military helicopter, would be placed on furlough Monday if the shutdown continues. That number would climb to more than 5,000 and include employees at its Pratt & Whitney engine unit and Aerospace Systems unit if the shutdown continues into November, the company said in a statement. The Sikorsky employees who would be affected work at facilities in Stratford, Connecticut, West Palm Beach, Florida and Troy, Alabama. The Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems divisions would be affected if the shutdown persists through next week, UTC said. UTC relies on the government’s Defense Contract Management Agency to audit and approve manufacturing processes for its military products. The DCMA inspectors were deemed non-essential federal employees and are on furlough, UTC said. Aircraft maker Boeing said it is taking steps to deal with possible delays in jetliner deliveries, including its new 787 Dreamliner, because thousands of U.S. aviation officials needed to certify the planes have been idled. Any delays would likely affect the plane maker’s newest models and could affect development of other models such as the stretched 787-9 derivative, the company said. Older models like the 737, which don’t require significant engineering as part of the production, are less likely to be affected. Boeing said the potential delays depend on how long the shutdown lasts. It also would affect numerous programs and products in the company’s defense business. “We anticipate that we’ll be able to deliver some airplanes during the shutdown,” said John Dern, a spokesman at Boeing’s headquarters in Chicago. “For models that we’ve delivered lots of before with the same engineering, we have the authority, delegated to us by the FAA” to certify, Dern added, referring to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA said on Wednesday it is furloughing 15,500 workers out of 46,000 employees. The agency said that while some aircraft certification work will continue during the shutdown, it will be limited. The slowdown would affect Boeing’s 787 factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, because the FAA has held on to some of its airplane certification roles at that relatively new factory, Dern said. Boeing said it was taking steps to deal with potential delays, but declined to be specific. Companies who rely heavily on government funds are also vulnerable. USEC Inc, a supplier of enriched uranium for commercial nuclear power plants, said it may have to furlough some workers at an enrichment project in Ohio if the shutdown extends beyond Oct. 15. USEC needs about $48 million to complete the $350 million American Centrifuge project, which is 80 percent funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The plant, which will produce low-enriched uranium used to make nuclear fuel, employs 959 workers, mainly in Ohio and Tennessee. It is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year. “The money that would allow us to carry on for the next two weeks is the fiscal year 2013 funds that we have been able to carry over,” Paul Jacobson, vice president of corporate communications, told Reuters. USEC, which has about 1,770 employees, did not disclose how many employees could be furloughed.",10022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fiscal-companies/update-1-u-s-companies-warn-of-delays-furloughs-from-shutdown-idUSL1N0HS23U20131002

328,UTX,"WRAPUP 8-Obama, congressional leaders still deadlocked on shutdown","* Meeting ends with both sides blaming the other * Concerns grow over looming debt limit deadline * Obama scales back Asia trip * United Technologies warns of layoffs due shutdown By Jeff Mason and Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama met with Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress on Wednesday to try to break a budget deadlock that has shut wide swaths of the federal government, but there was no breakthrough and both sides blamed each other. After more than an hour of talks, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said Obama refused to negotiate, while House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of trying to hold the president hostage over Obamacare. Reid said Obama told Republicans “he will not stand” for their tactics. The White House later issued a statement saying that Obama remains hopeful that “common sense will prevail.” There was little to encourage hope for a quick solution to the two-day-old shutdown and hundreds of thousands of federal employees remained off the job without pay. Leaders of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Democratic-led Senate offered token concessions that were quickly dismissed by the other side. Obama, meanwhile, scaled back a long-planned trip to Asia. Republicans have tried to tie continued government funding to measures that would undercut Obama’s signature healthcare law. Obama and his Democrats say that is a non-starter. “The president reiterated one more time that he will not negotiate,” Boehner told reporters after the White House meeting. “All we’re asking for here is a discussion and fairness for the American people under Obamacare.” Reid said Democrats were willing to discuss any way to tackle the budget after a temporary funding bill is passed. “We’re through playing these little games,” he said. “My friend John Boehner ... cannot take yes for an answer,” he told reporters. The shutdown, which took effect Monday at midnight (0400 GMT Tuesday), has raised questions about Washington’s ability to carry out its most essential duties. Though it would do relatively little damage to the world’s largest economy in the short term, global markets could be roiled if Congress also fails to raise the debt limit before borrowing authority runs out in coming weeks. The shutdown has closed landmarks like the Grand Canyon, cut off government economic data reports and prevented some cancer patients from receiving cutting-edge treatment. United Technologies Corp, which makes Sikorsky helicopters and other items for the military, said it would be forced to furlough as many as 4,000 employees if the U.S. government shutdown continues through next week, due to the absence of government quality inspectors. “Am I exasperated? Absolutely I’m exasperated. Because this is entirely unnecessary,” Obama told CNBC television in an interview before meeting the congressional leaders. “I am exasperated with the idea that unless I say to 20 million people, ‘You can’t have health insurance,’ these folks will not reopen the government. That is irresponsible.” The U.S. Army’s top general said the shutdown was significantly harming day-to-day operations, and intelligence leaders say it is undermining their ability to monitor threats. A Federal Reserve official said it could delay the central bank’s ability to assess whether its monetary stimulus efforts are still needed. The uncertainty in Washington has forced Obama to scale back an Asia trip that was designed to reinforce U.S. commitment to the region. Despite the shutdown, Boehner’s Republicans have failed to derail Obama’s controversial healthcare law, which passed a milestone on Tuesday when it began signing up uninsured Americans for subsidized health coverage. The government on Wednesday scrambled to add computer capacity to handle an unexpectedly large number of Americans logging onto new online insurance marketplaces. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, speaking to CNBC, described the law as a “trainwreck” that was “creating havoc across the country,” and reiterated Republicans’ call for a one-year delay in its implementation. Though some moderate Republicans have begun to question their party’s strategy, Boehner so far has kept them united behind a plan to offer a series of small bills that would re-open select parts of the government most visibly affected by the shutdown. The Republican-controlled House passed and sent to the Senate on Wednesday a funding bill that would re-open the National Institutes of Health, which conducts medical research, and another bill to reopen shuttered federal parks and museums, such as the Smithsonian museums, the National Gallery of Art and the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Both bills passed with the support of about two-dozen Democrats, who joined Republicans. The House was expected to vote Thursday on measures to fund veterans’ care, the District of Colombia and the Army Reserve. The measures are likely to be defeated in the Democratic-controlled Senate, and Obama said he would veto them if they reached his desk. Still, they allowed Republicans to charge that their adversaries are standing in the way of help for elderly veterans and young cancer patients. “Will they now say ‘no’ to funding for veterans, our National Parks and the National Institutes of Health?” asked Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. A Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated that 24 percent of Americans blamed Republicans for the shutdown, while 19 percent blamed Obama or Democrats. Another 46 percent said everyone was to blame. The shutdown fight is rapidly merging with a higher-stakes battle over the government’s borrowing power that is expected to come to a head soon. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said the United States will exhaust its $16.7 trillion borrowing authority no later than Oct. 17. The government could have difficulty paying pension checks, interest charges and other bills after that point. Many Republicans see the debt limit vote as another opportunity to undercut Obama’s healthcare law or extract other concessions - an approach that business groups say could lead to disaster. “You can re-litigate these policy issues in a political forum, but they shouldn’t use the threat of causing the U.S. to fail on its ... obligations to repay on its debt as a cudgel,” Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein told reporters after he and other financial-industry executives met with Obama. Some Democrats have begun to consider asking Obama to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling on his own - a move that could lead to years of court battles. The White House has said that approach is not feasible. The U.S. dollar stayed under pressure as Asian trading began on Thursday while share markets flatlined. Obama said Wall Street should be worried about the debt ceiling. “I think this time’s different. I think they should be concerned,” Obama told CNBC. “When you have a situation in which a faction is willing potentially to default on U.S. government obligations, then we are in trouble.” A short-term shutdown would slow U.S. economic growth by about 0.2 percentage points, Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday, but a weeks-long disruption could weigh more heavily - 0.4 percentage points - as furloughed workers scale back personal spending. The last shutdown in 1995 and 1996 cost taxpayers $1.4 billion, according to congressional researchers.",10032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fiscal/wrapup-8-obama-congressional-leaders-still-deadlocked-on-shutdown-idUSL1N0HS0CO20131003
329,UTX,United Technologies' Sikorsky cancels shutdown-related furloughs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Military contractor Sikorsky Aircraft, a division of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), has canceled temporary layoffs that had been scheduled to start on Monday, due to the U.S. government shutdown, spokesman Paul Jackson said on Sunday. The move, reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal, came in the wake of the decision by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to recall most of the Pentagon’s own furloughed civilian workers. United Technologies was one of several manufacturers that had warned of furloughs and delays in the deliveries of products as a result of the federal budget impasse. Many rely on federal workers to inspect and approve their products, or receive government funding for some of their operations. Sikorsky, a large military contractor that makes Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters and other aircraft for all five branches of the U.S. armed forces, had announced last week that it would lay off nearly 2,000 workers beginning Monday, and possibly as many as 5,000 if the shutdown continued into November. Sikorsky’s Jackson called Hagel’s decision “a surprise,” and termed the company’s cancellation of furloughs “great news.” Other big defense contractors adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Gordon Johndroe, vice president of worldwide media relations of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), said “it’s too early to tell” whether the company will carry out plans, announced last week, to furlough some 3,000 employees beginning on Monday. “We’ll continue to be in close contact with the Pentagon and are hopeful that our programs and contracts can move forward.” On Friday, Lockheed Martin announced that the number of employees who faced furlough as a result of the government shutdown is expected to increase weekly in the event of a prolonged shutdown.

330,UTX,UPDATE 1-United Technologies' Sikorsky cancels shutdown-related furloughs,"NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Military contractor Sikorsky Aircraft, a division of United Technologies Corp, has canceled temporary layoffs that had been scheduled to start on Monday, due to the U.S. government shutdown, spokesman Paul Jackson said on Sunday. The move, reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal, came in the wake of the decision by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to recall most of the Pentagon’s own furloughed civilian workers. United Technologies was one of several manufacturers that had warned of furloughs and delays in the deliveries of products as a result of the federal budget impasse. Many rely on federal workers to inspect and approve their products, or receive government funding for some of their operations. Sikorsky, a large military contractor that makes Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters and other aircraft for all five branches of the U.S. armed forces, had announced last week that it would lay off nearly 2,000 workers beginning Monday, and possibly as many as 5,000 if the shutdown continued into November. Sikorsky’s Jackson called Hagel’s decision “a surprise,” and termed the company’s cancellation of furloughs “great news.” Other big defense contractors adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Gordon Johndroe, vice president of worldwide media relations of Lockheed Martin Corp, said “it’s too early to tell” whether the company will carry out plans, announced last week, to furlough some 3,000 employees beginning on Monday. “We’ll continue to be in close contact with the Pentagon and are hopeful that our programs and contracts can move forward.” On Friday, Lockheed Martin announced that the number of employees who faced furlough as a result of the government shutdown is expected to increase weekly in the event of a prolonged shutdown. The affected employees include those unable to work because the government facility where they perform their work is closed, because their work requires a government inspection that cannot be completed, or because the company received a stop-work order.

333,UTX,Pentagon withholding payments from six weapons makers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department is withholding payments from six arms makers for problems with their internal business systems, including Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and two United Technologies Corp units. The Pentagon’s Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) stepped up enforcement of rules for the business systems that companies use to track cost and schedule information under a 2011 change in federal acquisition rules. U.S. Navy Commander Bill Urban, a Pentagon spokesman, said DCMA had “consistently maintained rigor in making determinations on all contractor business systems” since the change in the law, and there had not been a recent change in enforcement. Congress and top Pentagon officials have tried to increase oversight of major weapons programs in recent years after billions of dollars of cost overruns and schedule delays that affected nearly ever major weapons program. Urban said the agency was withholding payments ranging from 2 percent to 5 percent from two Lockheed units, two United Technologies units, Northrop, and AAI Corp, a unit of Textron Inc, for problems with their respective “earned value management systems,” or EVMS. The latest company to have funds withheld is Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, which builds engines for the F-35 fighter jet, and is facing a 5 percent withhold rate, Urban said. DCMA began withholding 5 percent of payments from Sikorsky Aircraft, another United Technologies unit, starting September 6, for issues with direct costs and material accounting, he said. The agency started holding back 5 pct of payments from Northrop’s Global Hawk program beginning August 27, for seven deficiencies involving direct costs and changes associated with revisions to its “estimates at completion,” he said. The total amount withheld thus far was $584,000, Urban said. Textron Inc has faced a 2 percent withholding since March 2013. Lockheed’s Aeronautics division is having 2 percent of payments withheld, effective August 30, when the rate was lowered from 5 percent, after the company made “significant progress: toward fixing the deficient system. Lockheed’s space systems unit was hit with a 5 percent withholding beginning in March 2012, Urban said.

335,UTX,Cost cuts help United Tech's forecast as revenue lags,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, raised the low end of its 2013 profit forecast on Tuesday, as cost savings from job cuts helped offset weakness in its defense business. The diversified manufacturer, which also produces Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Black Hawk helicopters, cut its projection for full-year revenue to roughly $63 billion from $64 billion as third-quarter sales fell short of analysts’ targets. Uncertainty over the U.S. government sequestration program, which involves spending cuts on federal projects, is weighing on United Tech’s military business, which accounts for about 18 percent of revenue, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said in an interview. “That’s where the revenue shortfall occurred, both in the quarter as well as for the full year,” Hayes said. “The good news is the rest of the business is doing well.” For example, Hayes pointed to rising orders in China, up 11 percent in the quarter for the company’s Otis elevators business. “China continues to be very, very strong,” Hayes said. Shares of United Tech, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, fell 0.5 percent to $107.11 in morning trading. The stock is up more than 30 percent this year. The company said third-quarter net income rose to $1.43 billion, or $1.57 per share, from $1.42 billion, or $1.56 per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $1.55 per share from $1.37, topping the analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 2.8 percent to $15.46 billion, missing analysts’ expectations of $16.18 billion. Sales rose 11 percent in China and 3 percent in North America, excluding acquisitions, while they fell 1 percent in Europe. Operating profit rose in four of United Tech’s five segments, with the Sikorsky unit, which produces Black Hawks, posting lower results. Spare part orders at Sikorsky, which derives 80 percent of its business from the military, are down 50 percent so far this year, Hayes said. “What we’re finding is that the folks in Washington, because of the uncertainty around sequestration, have not been ordering anything they don’t absolutely, positively need,” Hayes said. “So there’s been a reluctance to commit funding for spare parts.” Sikorsky also lost about one week of production due to the U.S. government shutdown earlier this month, Hayes said, although the effect on earnings was less than a penny per share. United Tech said it expected to invest $500 million in restructuring this year. The company, which reported having 218,000 employees at the end of 2012, has reduced its headcount by about 2,000 jobs this year. The company now expects full-year earnings of $6.10 to $6.15 per share, raising the low end from $6.00. Analysts have been looking for a profit of $6.16 per share on revenue of $63.9 billion. Last year, United Tech acquired plane component maker Goodrich for $16.5 billion, the largest deal in its history. With Goodrich, United Tech now derives 55 percent of its revenue from its aerospace units, but wants to boost its contribution from its commercial building businesses, Hayes said. “We’d like to see more of a 50-50 split, and so we’ll be looking for acquisition opportunities on the building side,” Hayes said, noting that the focus would probably be on deals in emerging markets. To take advantage of urbanization in emerging markets, United Technologies recently reorganized its elevator and climate segments under one business.

The Pentagon’s F-35 program office and Pratt said the two sides signed a $508 million contract modification on Wednesday. Added to previously awarded preliminary contracts, that brought the total value of the contract to $1.1 billion. The contract covers 38 F135 engines, as well as program management, engineering support, sustainment and spare parts. “This agreement represents a significant milestone for the F-35 program, and reflects the execution of cost reduction initiatives shared by the government and Pratt & Whitney,” the program office and Pratt said in a joint statement. The two sides reached agreement on the contract terms in late August and have been ironing out the details since then. The contract reflects a 2.5 percent reduction in the price of the common configuration engine used in both the Navy and Air Force models of the F-35, and a 9.6 percent cut in the price of the engine that powers the B-model, which takes off from shorter runways and lands like a helicopter, according to the statement. The release did not give details on the cost of each engine. “The engine price has been going down and that trend will continue,” Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who heads the F-35 program, said in the joint statement. He said Pratt’s senior leaders were working closely with the company’s suppliers to continue driving down the cost. Chris Flynn, vice president of F135 and F119 engines for Pratt, said the key to generating further savings would be increasing volume and production rates. “We remain focused on reducing costs, meeting our delivery schedule commitments, and increasing the tempo of contracting,” he said in the statement. Pratt has delivered 115 production engines to the program to date. Deliveries of the new engines will begin in the fourth quarter of this year.

343,UTX,Pratt expects partial deal to sustain F-35 jet engines soon,"FORT WORTH, Texas, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, said on Friday that it expected to sign a partial agreement before the end of the year to fund operations and maintenance of the next batch of engines it is building for the Lockheed Martin Corp  F-35 fighter jet. Clifford Stone, director of F135 programs for Pratt, told Reuters at a ceremony at Lockheed’s headquarters that he expected to wrap up negotiations on the “sustainment” of the F135 engines that power the new fighter jet in coming weeks. That would be followed by a deal for the production of the new engines in the first half of 2014, Stone said. Pratt is the sole supplier of F135 engines for all three variants of the F-35 fighter jet. Stone said the company and the Pentagon decided to decouple the production and sustainment parts of the negotiations about the seventh and eighth batches of engines to ensure the continued ability of Pratt employees to work on engines after the start of the new year. Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt’s military engines business, told Reuters in September that the company expected to drive down the cost of the F135 engines by at least 2.5 percent, and perhaps more, in the next two contracts. Croswell said Pratt expected to match or beat the 2.5 percent reduction that it achieved on 32 of the 38 engines in a sixth production contract for $1 billion that it negotiated with the Pentagon in August.

345,UTX,UPDATE 2-Canada says back on track to buy Sikorsky helicopters,"By Louise Egan OTTAWA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Canada has reached an agreement with United Technologies Corp’s Sikorsky Aircraft unit to reactivate a C$5 billion ($4.7 billion) deal to buy 28 helicopters that had been beset by delays and was almost scrapped by Ottawa. Canada signed a contract in 2004 for Sikorsky’s Cyclone helicopters to replace its ageing fleet of Sea Kings. But after delays and complications, Ottawa announced last September that it might scrap the deal and consider other options. The Conservative government now says it has accepted the recommendations of a third-party report for a different project model and governance structure. It reached an agreement with Sikorsky on Dec. 31, which will form the basis for formal contract negotiations. Sikorsky also agreed to pay Canada $88.6 million in liquidated damages for non-delivery. “Under the new terms established in the Principles of Agreement, Sikorsky has committed to deliver the needed helicopter capability at no additional cost to Canada,” Diane Finley, Canada’s minister of public works and government services, said in a statement. “In addition, the Government of Canada will only issue further payment to Sikorsky upon capability delivery,” she said. Canada will see delivery of helicopters with enough capability to allow the government to begin retiring its old helicopters in 2015. Sikorsky will enhance those capabilities to produce “fully capable” CH 148 Cyclone helicopters in 2018. Byron Callan, analyst with Capital Alpha Securities, said the deal was not material for a company the size of United Technologies, but it would allow Sikorsky to move past an issue that had been a source of concern. “It’s a Christmas present come late,” Callan said. “It allows them a clean slate to start the new year.” Sikorsky officials welcomed the deal. “We are very pleased to have reached this agreement with the Crown and look forward to a contract amendment while we continue to move the program forward,” said spokesman Paul Jackson. Sikorsky has so far provided just a handful of Cyclones for training purposes, and said last year that some of the delays were caused by major modifications requested by Canada. On Friday, the company apologized for the delays but said it was confident the new plan would succeed. “As the pre-eminent helicopter manufacturer in the world, we regret that we have not executed this program to the satisfaction of the Government of Canada and that no aircraft were delivered in 2013,” said Sikorsky President Mick Maurer.",1032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-helicopters/update-2-canada-says-back-on-track-to-buy-sikorsky-helicopters-idUSL2N0KD1K720140103
346,UTX,"UPDATE 2-'Polar' freeze grips United States, disrupting travel, business","By Nick Carey and Kim Palmer CHICAGO/CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan 6 (Reuters) - A blast of Arctic air gripped the vast middle of the United States on Monday, bringing the coldest temperatures felt in two decades, causing at least four deaths, forcing businesses and schools to close and canceling thousands of flights. Shelters for the homeless were overflowing and the weather threatened to briefly curtail some oil production in the severe cold described by some meteorologists as the “polar vortex” and dubbed by media as the “polar pig.” Temperatures were 20 to 40 degrees F (11-22 degrees C) below average in parts of Montana, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nebraska, according to the National Weather Service. More than half the flights at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport were closed as fuel supplies froze, leaving crews unable to fill aircraft tanks. The afternoon temperature in Chicago was minus 12 Degrees Fahrenheit (minus 24 degrees C), making it colder than in areas of Antarctica, parts of which hovered around 32 F (0 C) during the southern hemisphere summer. The Arctic air was moving toward the east coast where temperatures were expected to fall throughout Monday as low as  0 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 18 degrees Celsius) in some areas on Tuesday. The coldest temperatures in years and gusty winds were expected as far south as Brownsville, Texas and central Florida, the National Weather Service said. The northeast saw unseasonably mild weather and rain, but authorities warned travelers to expect icy roads and sidewalks on Tuesday. At least four weather-related deaths were reported. In northwest Missouri, a one-year-old boy died Monday when the vehicle he was riding in crashed into a snow plow on an icy highway, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol. In Indianapolis, firefighters found the body of an elderly woman outside her home early on Monday. “It appeared she had been there for a while,” said Captain Michael Pruitt of the Wayne Township Fire Department. A 58-year-old man died on Sunday in northeastern Oklahoma after he lost control of his car on icy roads, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said. In Chicago, a 48-year-old man died of a heart attack while shoveling snow on Sunday night. In oil fields from Texas to North Dakota and Canada, the severe cold threatened to disrupt traffic, strand wells and interrupt drilling and fracking operations. It also disrupted grain and livestock shipments throughout the farm belt, curbed meat production at several packing plants and threatened to damage the dormant wheat crop. LIFE-THREATENING WIND CHILLS In Cleveland, Ohio, where the temperature was minus 3 degrees F (minus 19 degrees C) and was forecast to drop to minus 6 degrees F (minus 21 degrees C) overnight, homeless shelters were operating at full capacity. Shelter operators had begun to open overflow facilities to accommodate more than 2,000 people who had come seeking warmth. “There are also going to be people that won’t go into the shelters,” said Brian Davis, an organizer with Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless. Frostbite can set in within minutes in such low temperatures, according to experts. The National Weather Service issued warnings for life-threatening wind chills in western and central North Dakota, with temperatures as low as minus 60 F (minus 51 C). The U.S. cold snap mirrored or outdid freezing weather in parts of the world as Almaty, Kazakhstan where it was minus 8 degrees F (minus 22 C), Mongolia, where temperatures reached minus 10 degrees F (minus 23 C) and Irkutsk, in Siberia, where it was minus 27 degrees F (minus 33 C).

347,UTX,"UPDATE 4-Deep freeze grips United States, disrupting travel, business","By Nick Carey and Kim Palmer CHICAGO/CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan 6 (Reuters) - A blast of Arctic air gripped the vast middle of the United States on Monday with the coldest temperatures in two decades causing at least four deaths, forcing businesses and schools to close and canceling thousands of flights. Shelters for the homeless were overflowing due to the severe cold described by some meteorologists as the “polar vortex” and dubbed by media as the “polar pig.” Temperatures were 20 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (11 to 22 degrees Celsius) below average in parts of Montana, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nebraska, according to the National Weather Service. Babbitt, Minnesota, was the coldest place in the United States on Monday at minus 37F (minus 38.3C), according to the National Weather Service. It was chillier even than Mars in recent days, where NASA’s rover Curiosity showed a high temperature on Jan. 2 of minus 32.8F (minus 36C). The U.S. cold snap outdid freezing weather in Almaty, Kazakhstan, where it was minus 8F (minus 22C), Mongolia at minus 10F (minus 23C) and Irkutsk, in Siberia, at minus 27F (minus 33C). More than half the flights at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport were canceled as fuel supplies froze, leaving crews unable to fill aircraft tanks. The afternoon temperature in Chicago was minus 12F (minus 24C). The polar vortex, the coldest air in the Northern hemisphere that hovers over the polar region in winter but can be pushed south, was moving toward the East Coast where temperatures were expected to fall into Tuesday. The cold airmass originated over Siberia, the National Weather Service said on its website. The coldest temperatures in years and gusty winds were expected as far south as Brownsville, Texas, and central Florida, the National Weather Service said. The Northeast experienced unseasonably mild weather and rain, but authorities warned travelers to expect icy roads and sidewalks on Tuesday. Amtrak planned to operate its trains on a reduced schedule throughout the Northeast corridor on Tuesday, a spokesman said. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency, announcing that parts of the New York State Thruway in Western New York would be closed due to extreme winter weather conditions there. At least four weather-related deaths were reported, including a 48-year-old Chicago man who had a heart attack while shoveling snow on Sunday and an elderly woman who was found outside her Indianapolis home early Monday. In oil fields from Texas to North Dakota and Canada, the severe cold threatened to disrupt traffic, strand wells and interrupt drilling and fracking operations. It also disrupted grain and livestock shipments throughout the farm belt, curbed meat production at several packing plants and threatened to damage the dormant wheat crop. In Cleveland, Ohio, where the temperature was minus 3F (minus 19C) and was forecast to drop to minus 6F (minus 21C) overnight, homeless shelters were operating at full capacity. Shelter operators had begun to open overflow facilities to accommodate more than 2,000 people who had come seeking warmth. “There are also going to be people that won’t go into the shelters,” said Brian Davis, an organizer with Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless. Frostbite can set in within minutes in such low temperatures, according to experts. The National Weather Service issued warnings for life-threatening wind chills in western and central North Dakota, with temperatures as low as minus 60F (minus 51C). Some 4,000 flights were canceled and 7,500 delayed, according to FlightAware.com, which tracks airline activity.

The MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter was on a training flight with a five-member crew when it went into the Atlantic Ocean near Fort Story, about 150 miles (240 km) south of Washington, on Wednesday. Captain John Little, the Coast Guard section commander, told a news conference monitored over the internet that the search for the missing crew member had been suspended after more than 500 square miles of water had been checked. Captain Todd Flannery, commander of Helicopter Sea Combat Wing Atlantic, called the crash “absolutely heart-wrenching.” He identified the two sailors who died as crewman Petty Officer Brian Collins, 25, of Truckee, California, and pilot Lieutenant Wesley Van Dorn, 29, of Greensboro, North Carolina. One survivor was released from a Norfolk, Virginia, hospital on Thursday and the second may be released on Friday, Flannery said. Searchers have found the helicopter’s fuselage and tail section using radar. The cause of the crash of the helicopter made by the Sikorsky unit of United Technologies Corp is under investigation. The crew was part of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron Fourteen, based at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia.

351,UTX,Missing crew member's remains found in crashed U.S. Navy helicopter,"Jan 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy on Tuesday said its divers had found the remains of a missing crew member from its military helicopter that crashed off the Virginia coast last week, killing two sailors. The MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter was on a training flight with a five-member crew on Jan. 8 when it went into the Atlantic Ocean near Fort Story, about 150 miles (240 km) south of Washington. Navy divers searching the wreckage recovered the body of Lieutenant Sean Christopher Snyder on Tuesday, the Navy said in a statement late on Tuesday. It was a day after locating the aircraft’s cockpit and the 39-year-old missing pilot’s remains using a “remotely operated vehicle,” though the search was halted due to bad weather. Military officials had identified the two sailors who died as crewman Petty Officer Brian Collins, 25, of Truckee, California, and pilot Lieutenant Wesley Van Dorn, 29, of Greensboro, North Carolina. The helicopter had been conducting “routine mine countermeasure training,” the Navy said. “Sean was a man of honor and a true hero, not only to his country, but also to his wife, children, family, and friends,” his family said in a statement. Four of the crew members were rescued and taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital for treatment, where Collins and Van Dorn died there from unspecified injuries, the Navy said. The two others have since been released from hospital. The cause of the crash of the helicopter made by the Sikorsky unit of United Technologies Corp was under investigation. The search for the missing crew member had been suspended the day after the crash, on Jan. 9, after more than 500 square miles of water had been checked, officials said.

352,UTX,UPDATE 3-United Technologies profit tops estimates; revenues miss,"By Lewis Krauskopf Jan 22 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, reported a rise in fourth-quarter profit that topped estimates, helped by a delay in shipping a helicopter order. The diversified manufacturer said it did not ship eight helicopters under a Canadian contract, as expected, which actually benefited its profit because they are sold at a loss, helping the profit top estimates. However, revenue was reduced by about $400 million because the helicopters were not delivered. Costs for the maritime helicopters have increased under the contract with the Canadian government, to the point that each is now expected to cost the company’s Sikorsky unit more to make than the price covers. The company expects to deliver the helicopters later this year. Total revenue at United Technologies, which also produces Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Black Hawk helicopters, rose 1.9 percent to $16.76 billion, it said on Wednesday. That was about $330 million short of analysts’ expectations. United Technologies shares rose 1 percent to $116.12 in morning trading. The stock, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, jumped about 37 percent in 2013, outpacing the broader U.S. market. In an interview, United Technologies Chief Executive Officer Louis Chenevert pointed to revenue growth of 4 percent, excluding acquisitions and even with the delayed helicopter shipment. “The combination of organic growth and our sustained cost reduction has us well-positioned for another good year,” Chenevert said. United Technologies backed its 2014 financial targets, which the company set last month. The company had improved its 2013 earnings outlook in recent quarters, as cost cuts offset weaker revenue than it expected at the start of the year. Earnings from continuing operations soared 53 percent to $1.45 billion, or $1.58 per share. That topped the average analyst estimate of $1.53 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The delay in the Canadian helicopter order boosted earnings by 6 cents per share compared with expectations, the company said. On a net basis, income fell 29 percent to $1.46 billion due to a big year-earlier gain from the sale of several industrial businesses. Operating profit rose across all five of business segments. The company gave other encouraging signs for its aerospace businesses. Orders for Pratt & Whitney engine spare replacement parts rose 20 percent, while such orders increased 19 percent for the aerospace segment that makes other plane components. “It’s nice to see the aftermarket activity picking up,” said Peter Arment, an analyst at Sterne Agee. “That’s good momentum.” Brian Langenberg, an analyst with independent research firm Langenberg & Co, pointed to strong performance in the segment that includes climate control products. Profit margins in that segment rose to 14.8 percent in the quarter from 11.1 percent a year earlier. Langenberg also cited an 8 percent increase in orders at its Otis elevators division. To take advantage of growth in cities in emerging markets, United Technologies last year reorganized its elevator and climate segments under one business.",1222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/unitedtechnologies-results/update-3-united-technologies-profit-tops-estimates-revenues-miss-idUSL2N0KW0HL20140122

354,UTX,United Technologies mulling Sikorsky unit options: report,"(Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is weighing options for its Sikorsky helicopter unit, including a potential sale or spinoff, industry publication Defense News reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources. United Technologies shares were up 2 percent in afternoon trading, against relatively flat U.S. markets. According to the report, Sikorsky, which manufactures the Black Hawk military helicopter, among others, could be a target for European companies seeking to enter the U.S. market. A United Technologies spokesman said the company does not comment on market rumors. In its fourth-quarter earnings report last week, United Technologies said Sikorsky totaled $6.25 billion in revenue for 2013, a decline of 7.9 percent, while operating profit fell more than 16 percent to $594 million. Sikorsky accounted for about 10 percent of United Technologies’ overall revenue of $62.6 billion last year. Peter Arment, an analyst with Sterne Agee, said that while U.S. military budgets for helicopters ballooned during the Iraq and Afghan wars, “going forward, helicopter budgets are resetting ... which will limit the growth of the helicopter industry for several years.” Valuations for defense companies trail United Tech’s other businesses, he added. United Technologies is a major player in parts of the aerospace industry as well as a big manufacturer of elevators and climate control systems. “We would view a spinoff of Sikorsky as positive and could unlock substantial value for UTX given it removes the lowest multiple portion of the company,” Arment said in a research note.

The agreement includes options that analysts say could result in billions of dollars of additional orders over the next three decades. The 109 helicopters will be assembled in Turkey and a version of Sikorsky’s popular Black Hawk. The main contractor is Turkish Aerospace Industries with components to be supplied by Sikorsky, Aselsan (ASELS.IS) and other Turkish companies. Sikorsky said the deal marked the start of an important partnership with Turkish industry. “Turkey is such an important market in terms of being a large customer, and it is also strategically important in terms of who they are in the world,” Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said in a telephone interview. He said the agreement would allow Turkish industry to develop the capability to produce nearly every part of the helicopter, including a newly designed Turkish cockpit. Maurer declined to give many details about the new agreement, but said it would give his company a second source for many of the helicopter’s components. He said Sikorsky had already agreed with Turkey to market the Turkish version of the Black Hawk in other markets, helping Sikorsky benefit from Turkey’s existing relationships in those areas and generating additional orders for Turkish suppliers. “We’re going out arm in arm, as we bring in other sales outside of Turkey that will be supplied by the new supply chain,” Maurer said. Sam Mehta, president of Sikorsky’s Defense Systems and Services division, said the deal marked the start of a 30-year relationship, and included options for a wide range of Turkish government agencies to buy versions of the helicopter.

366,UTX,UPDATE 2-Turkey signs $3.5 bln deal for Sikorsky helicopters,"By Seda Sezer and Andrea Shalal Feb 21 (Reuters) - Turkey signed a deal worth $3.5 billion on Friday to buy helicopters from United Technologies Corp’s  Sikorsky Aircraft unit, finalizing an order originally agreed upon in 2011, the prime minister said. The agreement includes options that analysts say could result in billions of dollars of additional orders over the next three decades. The 109 helicopters, a version of Sikorsky’s popular Black Hawk, will be assembled in Turkey. The main contractor is Turkish Aerospace Industries with components to be supplied by Sikorsky, Aselsan and other Turkish companies. Sikorsky said the deal marked the start of an important partnership with Turkish industry. “Turkey is such an important market in terms of being a large customer, and it is also strategically important in terms of who they are in the world,” Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said in a telephone interview. He said the agreement would allow Turkish industry to develop the capability to produce nearly every part of the helicopter, including a newly designed Turkish cockpit. Maurer declined to give many details about the new agreement but said it would give his company a second source for many of the helicopter’s components. He said Sikorsky would work with Turkey to market the international version of the Black Hawk in other countries, leveraging Turkey’s existing relationships in those areas and generating additional orders for Turkish suppliers. “We’re going out arm in arm, as we bring in other sales outside of Turkey that will be supplied by the new supply chain,” Maurer said.

368,UTX,"With 2015 budget, Pentagon looks beyond Afghanistan","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon unveiled a $496 billion base budget on Tuesday that shifts the United States from its war-footing for the first time in a dozen years, cutting the size of the military to pay for training and new weapons systems in an era of tighter spending. The budget sets the Obama administration on a collision course with Congress by seeking to eliminate popular older weapons and reform military compensation while proposing an additional $26.4 billion in military spending to be paid for by closing tax loopholes and cutting mandatory spending. It drew an immediate negative reaction on Capitol Hill, with U.S. Representative Buck McKeon, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, expressing “dismay about the shrinking might of the military reflected in this budget,” and noting that Russia and China were arming at “an alarming rate.” The department’s base budget for the 2015 fiscal year beginning in October would remain essentially flat for a third consecutive year as the Pentagon tries to comply with a congressional mandate to reduce projected spending by nearly $1 trillion over a decade. The White House said Pentagon’s funding levels would enable the military to protect U.S. interests and execute the country’s updated defense strategy, albeit with “somewhat increased levels of risk.” The risks “would grow significantly” if higher budget cuts go into force in 2016 and beyond as planned, it said. Analysts said the true level of defense spending would not be known until the Pentagon releases its war-funding request for 2015 in coming months. That segment of the budget that has become increasingly important source of operations and maintenance money because it is not subject to congressional budget caps. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said money included in the war-funding budget in 2014 largely offset the more than $30 billion in across-the-board cuts imposed on the base budget. The budget calls for the Army to shrink to between 440,000 and 450,000 soldiers, down from a war-time high of 570,000, a reduction of 40,000 to 50,000 compared to last year’s proposal. It would eliminate the entire fleet of popular A-10 “Warthog” tank-killer aircraft, as well as the venerable U-2 reconnaissance plane. The budget also cancels several other key weapons programs. The Army’s new ground combat vehicle would be eliminated, saving $3.4 billion over the next five years, and the Army communications network being built by General Dynamics Corp would be scaled back, saving another $3.4 billion. The budget also scraps plans to build two additional Lockheed Martin Corp Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites, for $2.1 billion in savings, and defers two Global Positioning System III satellites to be built by Lockheed. The Air Force’s proposed new combat rescue helicopter, a program for which Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp. was the sole bidder, would be delayed. The Pentagon would use some of the savings to invest in new research, development and procurement. The budget includes $153.9 billion for weapons, including $40 billion for aircraft, $22 billion for ships and $8.2 billion for missile defense. The budget included a $79.4 billion figure for war funding for 2015, but that was described as a “placeholder” until the actual request is submitted once the size of any post-2014 U.S. force in Afghanistan is known. The war-funding supplement, for Overseas Contingency Operations, has remained in the $80 billion range since fiscal 2013, even as the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan has fallen to 33,700 from about 88,000. While the 2015 budget assumes the Afghanistan war will end after December 2014, the administration indicated it would continue seeking additional war funding in the coming years. It proposed a total cap of $450 billion on contingency operations between fiscal 2013 and 2021.

370,UTX,UPDATE 1-Lufthansa unveils new premium economy class,"* Lufthansa follows rivals such as BA, United * To be fitted first on 747-8, then other long-haul planes * Aims to steal customers from rivals By Victoria Bryan BERLIN, March 5 (Reuters) - Lufthansa, Germany’s largest airline, unveiled its new premium economy class on Wednesday, part of a 3 billion euro investment in seats to catch up with fast-growing rivals from the Middle East. The airline said the new class would first be available on long-haul flights from November on its Boeing 747-8, flying to destinations such as Washington DC, Los Angeles or Hong Kong. Lufthansa is following around 40 other airlines that already have a premium economy class such as British Airways, United or Qantas. The premium economy concept has been around for more than a decade. Lufthansa Passenger Airlines Chief Commercial Officer Jens Bischof said the airline had had sleepless nights about whether to introduce a premium economy class but was comfortable now the group had upgraded its business class, meaning there was enough of a difference between economy and business to justify the introduction of a premium economy. He said he believed the product was of a high enough quality that the airline would be able to snatch customers from rivals. A return flight in premium economy, which give customers more luggage allowance, more space and bigger entertainment screens among other benefits, will cost on average 600 euros more than a regular economy ticket, but far less the average 2,000 euro mark-up for a business class seat, Bischof said. “The biggest question is whether businesses will now book the class for those travelling on business,” airline consultant Gerald Wissel from Airbourne told Reuters. Bischof said around 70 percent of business travellers were travelling in economy these days. “We believe the upsale potential for economy to premium economy is far bigger than the downsell from a full-class business with a flat seat,” he told a packed crowd at the ITB travel fair in Berlin. Bischof said the airline was investing 3 billion euros in improving its product for customers, not counting the 36 billion euros worth of new aircraft it has ordered. He put the investment in the premium economy at 170 million euros, compared with 1 billion for the business class refurbishment. Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said it was important for Lufthansa to invest in its product, even as it cut costs. “They want to be the first European five-star airline. Like a lot of German companies in other industries, they will never be the lowest on costs, so you’d better have a better product than anyone else,” Furlong said, referring to Lufthansa’s attempts to get a five-star rating from Skytrax, which reviews and ranks airlines. Airlines with five-star ratings include Singapore and Cathay, among others. Lufthansa said premium economy would make up around 10 percent of seat capacity on its long-haul flights, carrying around 1.5 million passengers a year in the class. It will be fitted on all 106 of its long-haul planes within a year. Bischof added the group had no plans at present to introduce it on short- or medium-haul, or on other airlines within the Lufthansa group, such as Austrian Airlines.",3052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/lufthansa-premiumeconomy/update-1-lufthansa-unveils-new-premium-economy-class-idUSL6N0M21PJ20140305
371,UTX,U.S. Air Force to fund rescue helicopter in last-minute reversal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force decided on Tuesday to start work on a new rescue helicopter by United Technologies Corp’s Sikorsky Aircraft in fiscal 2015, a surprising turnaround hours after the Pentagon told Congress the program had been postponed. Air Force Secretary Deborah James made the abrupt decision on the Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH) program shortly before officials began briefing reporters about the Air Force’s budget for the fiscal year beginning October 1. Influential lawmakers had pressed for the change, which was the latest twist in a nearly decade-long quest by the Air Force to replace its aging fleet of Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters. “Moving forward with the CRH contract award protects a good competitive price and effectively uses the $334 million Congress appropriated for the program,” James said in a statement. “Over the last 10 years, the Air Force has discussed upgrading the platform that performs this sacred mission for all DoD personnel who go into harm’s way,” said James, referring to the Department of Defense. “This mission is part of the military ethos, and the Air Force is committed to providing it.” Analysts say the program to build 112 new helicopters is valued at around $6.8 billion. In 2006, Boeing Co’s H-47 Chinook helicopter was chosen, but the Pentagon canceled the $15 billion contract in 2009 after multiple protests by the losing bidders. The Air Force was poised last year to award the contract to Sikorsky, the sole bidder, but delayed the decision while independent cost estimators reviewed the bid. The Air Force said it would take $430 million from other priorities to fund the program, and hoped to award a contract to Sikorsky by the end of June. “Sikorsky and our teammate Lockheed Martin thank the U.S. Air Force for enabling us to build a modern and affordable combat rescue helicopter,” said Sikorsky spokesman Frans Jurgens. Other potential bidders have dropped out, complaining the rules favored Sikorsky’s Black Hawk helicopter. The Air Force said the award would come after a review by senior Pentagon officials and an independent cost estimate. Senators Charles Schumer, who heads the Senate rules committee, and Dick Durbin, who heads the Senate defense appropriations subcommittee, called James on Tuesday after they learned that the budget did not include funding for the rescue helicopter, said a source familiar with the matter who is not authorized to speak publicly about it. “There’s a lot of support for this program,” the source said. Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, applauded the decision and said she had spoken to James on Tuesday afternoon about the 112 helicopter contract. “The combat rescue helicopters are critical life-saving assets that the Air Force has needed for years to replace its current fleet of worn-down aircraft,” she said in a statement. DeLauro was one of 74 lawmakers in the House of Representatives to sign a letter in December urging support for the rescue helicopter program. James said the program could still face challenges in Congress and would have to be reevaluated if mandatory budget cuts resumed in fiscal 2016.

375,UTX,United Tech upbeat on sales to 2020; first quarter view lags Street,"(Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer United Technologies Corp. (UTX.N) forecast sales may approach $100 billion by the end of the decade, up from roughly $64 billion expected for 2014, as the company grows at about twice the pace of the global economy. Despite the upbeat long-term outlook, shares of the large manufacturer of jet engines, elevators and climate control systems fell 2.2 percent after it forecast first-quarter profit below Wall Street's target. The stock was the biggest decliner in the Dow Jones industrials index .DJI in afternoon trading at $113.21 on the New York Stock Exchange. At a meeting it held for analysts and investors, United Tech said it aims to increase revenue by mid-single-digit percentages annually, excluding acquisitions, from now until 2020. The company is targeting revenue rising to $85 billion to as much $100 billion by 2020, with deals potentially helping the company reach the high end. “We have solid programs, solid backlog that is going to allow us to drive our top-line growth through the end of the decade and sales will approach $100 billion,” Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes told the conference, which was held in United Tech’s hometown of Hartford, Connecticut and broadcast over the Internet. “We’re going to grow almost two times world GDP over this period just based on the backlog that we see today,” Hayes said. United Tech’s businesses that serve buildings, such as Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioning units, are benefiting from growth of cities in emerging markets such as China. Its Pratt & Whitney jet engine business is launching a new engine expected to revitalize its sales on commercial airliners. The company’s Sikorsky helicopter unit has been in focus since a January report in publication Defense News said United Technologies was weighing options for Sikorsky, including a potential sale or spinoff. When asked at the meeting about Sikorsky, Chief Executive Officer Louis Chenevert said the company does not comment on rumors. But he touted opportunities for the maker of Black Hawk helicopters, including the potential for expanding margins and international sales. “Sikorsky, in my view, is a UTC kind of company,” Chenevert said. Asked about acquisitions, Hayes said United Technologies would be more focused on “bigger” deals than smaller, and was more likely to look for deals to support its commercial businesses than for aerospace. However, the company, which struck a roughly $16 billion deal a few years ago for aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp, is not expected to do anything big soon, Hayes said. “I don’t see a big deal as I stand here today in the next 18 months,” Hayes said.

383,UTX,DEALTALK-M&A; pickup among US conglomerates may be undercut by prices,"(For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on ) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - When United Technologies Corp  paid more than $16 billion to buy plane parts-maker Goodrich Corp about two years ago, the U.S. conglomerate’s biggest-ever takeover raised some eyebrows for its rich valuation. But that is nothing compared to what a buyer would need to cough up today for Rockwell Collins Inc, a similar airplane components maker deemed by Morningstar to be one of the most likely takeout candidates in the industrials sector. While United Tech paid 12.4 times Goodrich’s trailing operating earnings at the time, according to Thomson Reuters data, Rockwell’s shares now trade at about that level, without any deal premium baked into the price. Takeout premiums among industrials companies averaged about 25 percent last year. Such is the dilemma facing United Tech, 3M Co, Honeywell International and other diversified manufacturers that are eager to bolster their businesses through deals and yet may hesitate as the rising stock market drives prices higher. “There are a lot of companies that want to do deals,” said Jeff Sprague, managing partner at Vertical Research Partners, which focuses on the industrial sector. “The question will be can they really get them done. They’ve been reluctant to pull the trigger because of high valuations, and they’ve only gone higher.” The valuations for the broadly defined industrials sector have climbed on average from 8 times forward EBITDA to 10 times in the past 18 months, said Michael Santini, global head of Deutsche Bank’s industrials group. “As the equity markets have driven multiples higher across the industrials sector, we have seen a pick-up in IPOs and spin-offs, but more challenges in getting M&A; deals announced,” Santini said. Competition from private equity firms, with easy access to capital due to low interest rates, has also buoyed prices for industrials targets. For example, Carlyle Group LP agreed to buy Illinois Tool Works’ industrial packaging unit last month for $3.2 billion. Many analysts are predicting an increase in deals this year in the industry after a lull in 2013. But high prices will cause companies to pause before striking, as a risky deal could anger their shareholders or even draw an activist investor. The safe route might be to use that capital to buy back shares or increase dividends. Take SPX Corp : After the industrial machinery maker’s failed $4 billion bid for rival Gardner Denver in late 2012 sent SPX shares tumbling, activist fund Relational Investors bought a big stake. “In this environment we are seeing equity investors focused on making sure that companies are being disciplined around capital allocation, both institutional shareholders but also the activists are providing some of that discipline,” Santini said. At the same time, companies will look closely at deals if they feel they will struggle to grow on a standalone basis. Multi-industry companies posted sales increases of 3.7 percent on average in the fourth quarter, only “modest improvement” compared to the third quarter, according to William Blair analyst Nick Heymann. “If you can’t get it organically, what are you going to do? You’re going to have to go buy it,” Heymann said. Industrial companies reorganize through deals, which allow them to obtain growing products, realize cost savings and find other ways to augment their central businesses. Such reshaping can include sales or spinoffs by the companies themselves, often in response to investor pressure, to focus on their central businesses. Dover Corp made such a move earlier this month with its spin-off of microphones maker Knowles Corp, while General Electric is exiting its private label credit card business. Globally, acquisitions by all industrial companies slipped 8 percent last year, more steep than the 6 percent overall decline for global deals, according to Thomson Reuters data. The value of acquisitions by 10 U.S.-based multi-line industrial companies fell last year to the lowest level since 1998, according to Thomson Reuters data. “M&A; is a core part of what industrials do and that’s how they optimize their portfolios over time,” said Kevin Toney, senior portfolio manager with American Century Investments. “My sense is the buyers wanted to buy, but maybe the prices just weren’t there.” Because of the diverse lines of business for these manufacturers, potential targets exist in numerous sectors, including aerospace, security or climate control systems, healthcare products or electrical equipment. Certainly, conditions look ripe for a deal pickup in many ways. Analysts at Citi Research noted recently that among multi-industry companies, net debt stands at “attractive lows” of only 17 percent of total capital. “The sector currently holds ample firepower for strategic deals, with a willingness to pull the trigger once the M&A; climate improves,” Citi analyst Deane Dray wrote in a research note earlier this month. The lofty level of the stock market also could be a benefit to potential acquiring companies. “The average buyer has a stock that has gone up a lot so they have a lot of currency,” said Scott Davis, an analyst at Barclays. “I think we’re going to see a lot more transactions using stock.” There is no shortage of eager buyers. Honeywell’s Chief Executive Dave Cote said at the conglomerate’s investor day earlier this month that the company was planning on $10 billion in deals through 2018, more than double what the company spent the previous five years. 3M has expressed a willingness to spend “multi-billion dollars” on individual deals, more than it has in the past, as it eyes $5 billion to $10 billion in acquisitions through 2017. Danaher Corp, which has cited $8 billion in “M&A; capacity,” is among the other companies expected to be on the prowl this year. United Technologies last week became the latest company to make noise about bulking up through acquisitions. Not yet two years removed from closing its Goodrich deal, executives said they did not foresee an acquisition anytime soon. But United Tech has set a target of $50 billion in revenue for its commercial buildings segment by 2020, recognizing that about $8 billion of $21 billion needed for that goal might have to come from acquisitions. United Tech’s targets could include security companies Allegion and Tyco International, and electrical and lighting systems company Hubbell Inc, according to Credit Suisse. “We have demonstrated that we do very well on large deals,” United Technologies Chief Executive Louis Chenevert told the investor conference, adding: “Some of you thought I overpaid on Goodrich. I don’t think anybody thinks I overpaid today on Goodrich.”   (Additional reporting by Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Grant McCool)",3212014,http://www.reuters.com/article/industrials-deals/dealtalk-ma-pickup-among-us-conglomerates-may-be-undercut-by-prices-idUSL2N0MA2AX20140321
384,UTX,US Navy's Sikorsky helicopters cancellation would cost government $250 mln - Levin,"WASHINGTON, March 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy’s plan to cancel an order for 29 MH-60 Sikorsky helicopters under a current five-year agreement would trigger termination fees of at least $250 million and raise the cost of Army helicopters covered by the same contract, a top U.S. senator said Thursday. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, criticized the Navy’s plan to “break” the multi-year purchase agreement during a hearing on the Navy and Marine Corps budget requests. “This action would result in the government having to pay termination charges of at least $250 million but get nothing in return,” he said. The cut in MH-60 helicopters is one of a number of controversial proposals sent by the Navy and other U.S. military services to U.S. lawmakers, who have the ultimate control over the Pentagon budget. Navy officials said deep budget cuts agreed by Congress had forced them to make difficult choices across various portfolios in shaping the fiscal 2015 budget. Levin dismissed the Navy’s claim that scrapping the fiscal 2016 order of helicopters was related to the planned retirement of the USS George Washington aircraft carrier, noting that each carrier had only five MH-60 helicopters on board. The Navy had no immediate comment on the amount of the projected termination fee. Such fees are generally negotiated between the government and industry. One Navy official said the fiscal 2015 budget included the advanced procurement funding needed to maintain the multi-year contract for now. The reductions planned in fiscal 2016 were linked to the potential cut of an aircraft carrier and coastal combat ships, said the official. Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies Corp, signed an $8.5 billion contract with the Army and Navy in July 2012 to buy 653 Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters through December 2017, a deal that generated significant discounts given the larger order quantities. By reneging on the agreement, the Navy was jeopardizing those savings, Levin said. One industry source familiar with the issue said it was rare for the military to break a multi-year contract because they resulted in savings of 10 percent or more, and violating such agreements generated costly termination fees. One congressional aide, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said lawmakers were considering measures to prevent the Navy from cutting the funding in its fiscal 2016 budget. Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant, said the Navy had cut funding for the MH-60 and other aircraft programs to preserve money for higher priority shipbuilding programs.

385,UTX,Pratt must push harder to cut F-35 engine cost: Pentagon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney, the engine-making unit of United Technologies Corp, must redouble efforts to lower the cost of the single F135 engine it builds for the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet, a top U.S. military official said on Monday. Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, deputy director of the Pentagon’s $392 billion F-35 program, said Pratt had slowed its cost-cutting after Congress in 2011 canceled an alternate engine being developed by General Electric Co. “We have reinvigorated the ‘war on cost’ that Pratt started and then kind of slowed down on when they got the monopoly,” Mahr told industry executives and military officials at an annual conference hosted by the Navy League. “In no uncertain terms, they’ve been informed they need to continue to drive the cost down on that engine,” Mahr told reporters after his remarks at the conference. The comments revealed continuing friction between the program office that runs the Pentagon’s costliest weapons program and Pratt at a time when the F-35 program chief, Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan has talked about improved relations with Lockheed, the prime contractor that builds the airplane. In 2012, Bogdan described relations between Lockheed, Pratt and the government as the worst he had seen in two decades of working on acquisition programs. Pratt said it had invested $60 million in “a very aggressive” cost-cutting program that had already lowered the cost of the F135 engine by 40 percent. “We are pursuing cost reductions in every aspect of the program, including supply chain, configuration changes, process improvements, and overhead,” said Pratt spokesman Matthew Bates. He said procurement delays affected costs. Mahr said the government was close to reaching agreement with Pratt on a seventh batch of engines for the new warplane that is being developed for the U.S. military and its allies, but declined to comment on the exact timing of a deal. Bates said the company hoped to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the second quarter. The Pentagon finalized a contract worth $1.1 billion for 38 engines in a sixth batch last October, which pushed the cost of the common configuration engine built for the Air Force and Navy models down by 2.5 percent. It did not provide the exact cost. Mahr said lawyers from the Pentagon’s F-35 office were also in talks with Pratt to publicly release details on the cost of the engine, which the government buys separately from the jet. Pratt argues it should not be required to disclose details about the costs of the engine or spare parts, since that could affect the company’s ability to compete in a next-generation engine procurement that the Pentagon is kick-starting with a new $1 billion technology demonstration program. Bates said other companies that built sole source military engines had successfully argued against releasing pricing data for such competition reasons in the past. Mahr said the overall F-35 program is making steady progress, although he said some technical issues still needed to be to resolved, including improving the performance of a complex computer-based logistics system called ALIS, and a recent crack in a fan blade on a Pratt engine. The Pentagon was also pressing the industry to lower the cost of building and operating the new jet, and making it more reliable, he said.

390,UTX,European shares at 3-week low on worries over Ukraine,"* FTSEurofirst 300 index falls 0.5 percent * Tech shares down 1.6 pct, tracks Nasdaq sell-off * Charts signal further weakness in near term By Atul Prakash LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - European shares extended losses on Monday, with a major index slipping to its lowest level in three weeks, as fresh tension in Ukraine prompted investors to shun cyclical sectors such as travel, autos and technology. Charts also pointed to a bearish outlook in the near term and the broader market remained vulnerable to further sell-offs, technical analysts said. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.5 percent at 1,305.78 points by 1017 GMT, after falling as low as 1,301.98, its weakest since late March. The index fell 3 percent last week, and analysts said the trouble in Ukraine could prevent it from bouncing back anytime soon. Cyclicals lost ground, with the STOXX Europe 600 Travel and Leisure index down 2.3 percent, tech shares  falling 1.9 percent and autos down 1.8 percent. However, losses were capped by a rise in some defensive sectors, such as personal and household goods and food and beverages, which were up more than 1 percent. “Geopolitical concerns are putting pressure on equities,” said Christian Stocker, an equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich. “Markets fear an escalation in tension will result in more economic sanctions on Russia and that will have a negative repercussion on Europe.” Ukraine gave pro-Russian separatists a deadline to disarm or face a “full-scale anti-terrorist operation”. The UN’s Security Council met in emergency session. Several firms exposed to Russia fell. Finnish tyre maker Nokian Renkaat, Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International, UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank by assets, and Belgian financial group KBC lost from 1.8 to 3.5 percent. Nokian Renkaat, Raiffeisen, UniCredit and KBC get 14 to 26 percent of their revenues from Russia. For a factbox on European firms most exposed to Russia, click on Germany’s benchmark DAX index, which includes several companies with significant exposure to Russia, lagged the wider market, falling 0.7 percent. The euro zone’s blue chip Euro STOXX 50 index  declined 0.7 percent to 3,094.87 points, with charts signalling that the index could fall further. “Although the slope of the 200-day moving average remains up at this juncture, the Euro STOXX 50 index has turned down from the up-channel resistance line stretching back to 2011 and the move below support around 3,150 is another worry for bulls,” said Murray Gunn, the head of technical analysis at HSBC. The index could find support around 2,971 points. On the upside, 3,196 is considered a strong resistance level. Among sectors, the STOXX Europe 600 tech index fell 1.6 percent, taking its losses since early April to more than 6 percent on concern that valuations have become stretched. Tech stocks are the most expensive in Europe, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. They trade at around 19 times their 12-month forward earnings, against a 10-year average of about 16 times and the STOXX 600’s price-earnings ratio of 14. Ericsson fell 4.2 percent and ARM Holdings  2.2 percent, mirroring losses on the Nasdaq, which ended on Friday below 4,000 for the first time since early February. Among other sharp movers, Greece’s largest lender, National Bank, fell 14 percent, making it the biggest decliner on the FTSEurofirst 300. A banker told Reuters on Saturday the bank might tap international markets with a share offering as part of plans to plug a capital shortfall. Despite recent jitters on Wall Street and simmering tensions in Ukraine, investors have continued to pour money into European equities. They attracted more than $1 billion in the week ended April 9, according to EPFR Global data.

Netflix Inc surged 5.9 percent to $369.04 a day after showing strong subscriber growth, a sign the trading favorite still had room to grow despite recent concerns over its valuation. With the day’s gain, the stock moved to the plus side for the year after a 21 percent drop in March.

U.S.-listed Valeant shares gained 7.6 percent to $135.56. Also providing support to the sector was a deal between Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline, in which the two companies traded over $20 billion worth of assets in an effort to cope with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition. U.S.-listed shares of Novartis gained 1.4 percent to $86.67 while shares of Glaxo trading in New York advanced 4.1 percent to $55.31.

Credit Suisse upgraded the social networking company to “outperform” on higher expectations for the company’s long-term average revenue per user. Better-than-expected earnings have lifted equities recently, though companies have largely been exceeding reduced forecasts. Profits are seen rising 1.1 percent this quarter, down from the 6.5 percent growth rate estimated at the start of the year. “Earnings are certainly providing a constructive context for engagement,” said Peter Kenny, CEO of Clearpool Group in New York. “They are also importantly providing forward looking-guidance and confidence the rally we’ve had over the previous three or four years, though we’ve seen a pause in the first quarter, is not a compelling reason to sell equities.” Dow components Travelers Cos Inc and United Technologies Corp both beat expectations, and United Tech raised the low end of its full-year profit outlook. Shares of Travelers rose 0.6 percent to $86.89 while United Tech was up 1.3 percent at $119.89.

397,UTX,United Tech broad revenue growth helps profit beat Street,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by revenue growth across its aerospace and commercial building segments and strong sales in China. The diversified manufacturer of elevators, jet engines and climate control systems, also lifted the low end of its 2014 earnings forecast. Excluding divestitures, revenue increased 5 percent and rose across all five of the business segments at United Tech, a member of Dow Jones industrials index. “Sales came in much better than what we expected,” United Tech Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said in an interview. First-quarter net income fell 4 percent to $1.21 billion, or $1.32 per share. Restructuring costs amounted to 9 cents a share while a year earlier the company received some one-time benefits. Still, the earnings of $1.32 per share topped the average analyst estimate by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters “Restructuring and corporate expenses were lower than we had anticipated, helping to drive the overall EPS ‘beat’,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a research note. Revenue rose 2.4 percent to $14.75 billion, just ahead of analyst estimates. United Tech’s businesses that serve buildings, such as Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioning units, are benefiting from growth of cities in emerging markets, such as China. Otis’ sales in China rose about 16 percent, while orders jumped about 25 percent, Hayes said. Sales at Otis increased 5 percent overall. “Maybe a little bit of a surprise, China continued to be very strong for us,” Hayes said. Its Sikorsky helicopter division, which has dragged down United Tech results in recent quarters due to weak U.S. military spending, saw sales increase 9 percent. While the maker of Black Hawks saw lower U.S. military shipments, Hayes said that was offset by international military and commercial sales. Its Pratt & Whitney jet engine segment, where the company is launching a newly designed engine for commercial aircraft, saw sales rise 4 percent, excluding divestitures. United Tech projected full-year earnings of $6.65 to $6.85 per share, raising the low end from $6.55. In offering a more bullish 2014 view, the company pointed to confidence in its full-year sales target of about $64 billion and to continued cost cuts. United Tech plans to spend $375 million on restructuring this year, up from its previous plan to spend $300 million. Through Monday, United Tech shares had climbed 4 percent this year, ahead of the broader U.S. markets.

Minor anomalies such as this are common in flight test. Early reports in the media of a fire on the engine were inaccurate.” The company said that for proprietary reasons it would not identify which engine was being tested. Bombardier Inc said the incident did not involve the PW1524 model of Pratt & Whitney’s new geared turbofan motor that will power its all-new CSeries jetliner. “That incident has no impact on our flight test program,” Bombardier Aerospace spokeswoman Marianella de la Barrera said. “It’s our understanding that the incident relates to another variant of the main family of the engine.” Bombardier, which is to report first-quarter financial results on Thursday, is “very pleased” with the performance of the PW1524 engine in CSeries testing, de la Barrera said. The engine, certified in February 2013, is in operation on three CSeries flight test vehicles. Last summer, Pratt & Whitney redesigned a component of its geared turbofan engine being developed for Airbus’s top-selling A320neo aircraft after tests revealed “distress” in the PW1100G engine’s hot core.

403,UTX,Sikorsky wins U.S. Navy deal for president's Marine One helicopters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, won an initial $1.24 billion contract to develop and build six new U.S. presidential helicopters, the first step toward a fleet of 21 new aircraft by 2023, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday. The award capped years of efforts by the U.S. Navy to replace the current fleet of aging Marine One helicopters, also built by Sikorsky, some of which have ferried the president and other top officials since 1974. Sikorsky has built all presidential helicopters since 1957, when Dwight Eisenhower became the first U.S. president to regularly use helicopters. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates canceled an earlier program managed by Lockheed Martin Corp in 2009 after the cost more than doubled to around $13 billion, prompting President Barack Obama to describe it “an example of the procurement process gone amok.” The total value of the new program is expected to be about $3 billion, said Marty Hauser, director of government communications for United Technologies. Lockheed will be the key subcontractor to Sikorsky on the new program, which is based on the Sikorsky S-92 helicopter that is already used by 10 nations for their head of state missions. “For 57 years, our company has been trusted with the critical responsibility of building and supporting a safe and reliable helicopter fleet for the president of the United States,” Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said in a statement. “We stand ready to deliver the next Marine One, the world’s most advanced executive transport helicopter.” Efforts to buy a new presidential helicopter began shortly after the September 11, 2001, hijacking attacks, which revealed the outdated nature of communications systems on the existing fleet. “I’m glad to see this is finally over,” said Mark Rosenker, a retired Air Force general who headed the White House Military Office at the time and initiated the drive to buy new aircraft. “These aircraft are maintained extremely well, but they need to brought into the 21st century,” Rosenker said. He said the previous acquisition got out of hand because of never-ending requirements, but Navy and White House officials now realized “they don’t have to have every bell and whistle.” Since 2004, Sikorsky has delivered more than 200 S-92 helicopters, mainly to companies in the oil and gas industry, and for use by civilian agencies for search and rescue. Sikorsky was the sole bidder for the helicopter after other companies decided not to compete. Navy Captain Dean Peters, who heads the program for the Navy, said the contract was on fixed-price terms, with an incentive fee. He said the goal was to integrate mature equipment into an existing, in-production aircraft to minimize development and testing costs. He said Sikorsky would build six test aircraft, of which four would later be used for operations. The contract will have options for 17 additional operational aircraft, the Navy said. Connecticut lawmakers Representatives Rosa DeLauro and John Larsen said the news would benefit Connecticut workers. “Sikorsky has long been synonymous with Marine One, the presidential helicopter,” DeLauro said. “Every president since Eisenhower has flown in a Sikorsky, made right in Connecticut.” ",5072014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-united-tech-helicopters/sikorsky-wins-u-s-navy-deal-for-presidents-marine-one-helicopters-idUSBREA4612J20140507

The engine, which is helping revitalize the company’s business of providing engines to commercial jets, is one of the main factors behind a major increase in production at Pratt expected in the coming years. “We have a lot of activity now lined up with the different airframers,” Pratt & Whitney President Paul Adams said during a media event in the company’s home base in East Hartford, Connecticut.

Asked about the U.S. government’s concerns about costs tied to the F-35 program, Adams said: “We continue to be absolutely laser-focused on cost reduction.” Pratt also said on Tuesday that it had signed more than $10 billion in long-term agreements with more than 90 suppliers in the past year as it prepares for an increase in commercial and military production.

408,UTX,UTC sees no big impact from Bombardier engine-test failure,"(Reuters) - The failure of a Pratt & Whitney jet engine during testing on a new Bombardier Inc plane last week is unlikely to have a significant impact on Bombardier’s testing schedule, an executive at Pratt parent United Technologies Corp said on Thursday. “We’re working now with Bombardier on a plan to resume testing here in the next few weeks,” United Tech Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes told an investor conference. The engine failure had raised concern about potential further delays for Bombardier’s new CSeries jet, which is already 18 to 24 months behind schedule. Hayes’ comments confirmed cautious optimism in the industry and on Wall Street that the fallout from the May 29 incident would be limited. A problem with Pratt’s engine that involved its signature gearing system, known as the Geared Turbofan, could have broader repercussions, since the engine is offered on Airbus’s A320neo narrow-body plane and other new regional jets. Earlier on Thursday, Pratt announced it had delivered its first GTF engine to Mitsubishi Aircraft for its MRJ90 regional jet. But a preliminary analysis showed the engine problem during stationary testing on the Bombardier CSeries jet did not relate to the engine’s gearing system, Hayes said. He added that the company has confidence in the engine’s architecture. “We think it was something much more simple than that,” Hayes said, though he noted the investigation was still ongoing. “We believe we have an understanding of what occurred and if we’re correct, we think it can be rapidly fixed,” he added. Hayes said he was confident United Tech would not face any significant financial exposure as a result of the incident. “If all of this comes true, then I would expect that this issue will not measurably impact their testing schedule or their delivery schedule,” said David Tyerman, a Toronto-based analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “It would be removing an uncertainty related to the program, which is important.” The failure occurred last Thursday during stationary maintenance testing of the CSeries, which Montreal-based Bombardier has spent billions developing in an effort to compete in the narrow-body jet market with Boeing Co and Airbus. A Bombardier spokesman said the United Tech comments were a “positive sign,” but reiterated that the airplane maker was still expecting to release an update in the coming days. Tyerman said demand for the CSeries remained a key uncertainty, and noted that the planemaker has not had orders from “brand-name customers” since Lufthansa and Korean Air. Pratt itself is banking on the new GTF engine, which offers better fuel efficiency than older models, to provide somewhat of a comeback for the engine maker’s commercial jet engine business. Bombardier shares were down 0.5 percent at C$3.68 late on Thursday morning. United Tech shares were up 0.4 percent at$117.58.

The amendment to the long delayed multibillion dollar deal will allow Canada to start retiring its fleet of aging Sea King helicopters in 2015 and accelerate operations of the new CH-148 Cyclone helicopters, the company said in a statement. It said the charge would be offset by one-time gains during the course of 2014, and the company’s forecast for earnings per share in 2014 remained unchanged at $6.65 to $6.85. “This agreement clears the way for us to deliver the world’s most advanced maritime helicopter capability to the Royal Canadian Air Force,” Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said in a statement. Public Works and Government Services Canada, which oversees defense procurements, said the government’s budget of C$1.9 billion the helicopters remained unchanged, and it would spend C$5.7 billion for in-service support of the new fleet through 2038, 10 years longer than planned. “I am pleased that this contract has now been completed and that we can fulfill our government’s commitment to begin to retire the Sea Kings in 2015, and deliver a new and leading maritime helicopter to the Royal Canadian Air Force,” said Diane Finley, minister of public works and government services.

On Wednesday, Canada said Hitachi Consulting, an independent group that reviewed and verified the new contract structure, would continue to oversee aspects of the implementation plan, ensuring that delivery times remain as promised. Maurer told Reuters in a telephone interview that the deal removed a cloud of uncertainty that had been hanging over the program and could revive interest from other countries in the new helicopters, which are based on Sikorsky’s S-92 helicopter.

419,UTX,UPDATE 2-United Technologies' Sikorsky wins $1.3 bln U.S. helicopter deal,"(Adds interview with Sikorsky executive) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, won a $1.28 billion contract on Thursday to develop a new combat rescue helicopter for the U.S. Air Force, a deal that could eventually be worth up to $7.9 billion. The initial contract covers development and delivery of four new Combat Rescue Helicopters (CRH) based on the company’s workhorse UH-60 Black Hawk, and caps nearly 15 years of repeated unsuccessful efforts by the Air Force to replace its aging fleet of HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters. The Air Force said Sikorsky beat its affordability target by about $700 million. Sikorsky welcomed the deal, noting that it has built combat search and rescue helicopters for the U.S. military since 1943. Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said the helicopters allowed the Air Force to “perform one of its most important and sacred missions - bringing our downed service members home safely.” Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the Air Force was the key service responsible for global personnel recovery, and remained committed to a mission she described as “part of the military ethos.” More than 12,200 U.S., allied and other forces have been saved in rescue missions around the world, the Air Force said. Thursday’s contract with Sikorsky comes after one of the longest-running and controversial acquisition programs the service has attempted in recent decades. “It has been a very, very long road,” Sam Mehta, president of Sikorsky Military Systems, told Reuters in an interview. He said Sikorsky bid aggressively to win the contract, aware of the budget pressures facing the Pentagon and expecting tough competition from other companies. He said work on Black Hawk variants for the Army and Navy would allow Sikorsky to leverage economies of scale in the supply chain and lower costs. The new contract - and a separate one for a new presidential helicopter - will bolster Sikorsky production from 2019 on, but the company still faces challenges in the near-term because of declining U.S. military spending, Mehta added. He said the company was heartened by news on June 24 that the Pentagon had approved the sale of Black Hawk helicopters to Mexico, a deal worth $225 million, and was chasing other orders. The Air Force awarded Boeing Co a contract to build 141 rescue helicopters based on its twin-rotor CH-47 “Chinook” design in 2006, but the deal was protested immediately by the losing bidders - Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin Corp - and later canceller by then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The Air Force restarted the program in 2012, but Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp and Europe’s Airbus later dropped out of the competition, arguing that the Air Force had skewed the requirements to favor Sikorsky’s helicopter. In March, the Air Force’s 2015 budget request to Congress omitted funding for the program, but officials added the program back in the same day under pressure from senior U.S. lawmakers.

422,UTX,Sikorsky warns of consequences if Pentagon breaks multiyear deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), said on Thursday it hoped Pentagon officials would realize that reneging on the final year of a five-year helicopter contract would undermine confidence in future deals and drive up costs. Sam Mehta, president of Sikorsky Defense Systems and Services, said he realized U.S. military officials were in a difficult position given mandatory cuts in defense spending, but that his company and others viewed the Navy’s plan to truncate its multiyear agreement as a “serious concern.” “If you violate one multiyear agreement, you basically undermine the basis for all multiyear contracting, which has delivered billions of dollars of savings to the DoD (Department of Defense),” Mehta told Reuters in a telephone interview. “I don’t know how the DoD would be able to face a contractor again and ask them to make long-term commitments on things like pricing,” Mehta said, noting that companies would be skeptical about making such agreements if the Pentagon set a precedent for backing out of the deals later. Mehta said lawmakers and military officials generally agreed that the move should be a “last recourse” and Sikorsky had not found anyone who favored the plan as a good way to save money. “Once they understand the amount of savings they’ll be forgoing in buying aircraft from Sikorsky going forward, and also buying aircraft or other military equipment from other suppliers, I think cooler heads will prevail,” he said. Outgoing Pentagon Comptroller Robert Hale this week told Reuters he hoped the Pentagon could avoid breaking the multiyear deal with Sikorsky, depending on how its broader budget negotiations with Congress turned out.  He said Pentagon officials realized that such a move was a big concern for the industry, and could be costly since contracts were generally structured with penalties for early termination. But budget pressures left Navy leaders little choice, given their greater need to restore training and maintenance, he said.

If Congress funded continued operation of the 11th carrier, he said, funding for the helicopters needed for the flight deck would also be restored.

424,UTX,"UPDATE 3-Sikorsky, Lockheed win $1.28 bln U.S. helicopter deal","(Adds Lockheed statement) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, won a $1.28 billion contract on Thursday to develop a new combat rescue helicopter for the U.S. Air Force, a deal that could eventually be worth up to $7.9 billion. The initial contract covers development and delivery of four Combat Rescue Helicopters (CRH) based on the company’s workhorse UH-60 Black Hawk, and caps nearly 15 years of repeated unsuccessful efforts by the Air Force to replace its aging fleet of HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters. The Air Force said Sikorsky and its key supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, beat the service’s affordability target by about $700 million. Sikorsky welcomed the deal, noting that it has built combat search and rescue helicopters for the U.S. military since 1943. Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said the helicopters allowed the Air Force to “perform one of its most important and sacred missions - bringing our downed service members home safely.” Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the Air Force was the key service for global personnel recovery, and remained committed to a mission she called “part of the military ethos.” More than 12,200 U.S., allied and other forces have been saved in rescue missions around the world, the Air Force said. Thursday’s contract with Sikorsky comes after one of the longest-running and controversial acquisition programs the service has attempted in recent decades. “It has been a very, very long road,” Sam Mehta, president of Sikorsky Defense Systems and Services, told Reuters. He said Sikorsky bid aggressively to win the contract, aware of the budget pressures facing the Pentagon and expecting tough competition from other companies. He said work on Black Hawk variants for the Army and Navy would allow Sikorsky to leverage economies of scale in the supply chain and lower costs. Lockheed said it would supply the mission systems and special equipment for the new helicopters, including adverse weather sensors, defensive systems and mission computers. The new contract - and a separate one for a new presidential helicopter - will bolster Sikorsky production from 2019 on, but the company still faces challenges in the near-term because of declining U.S. military spending, Mehta added. He said the company was heartened by news on Tuesday that the Pentagon had approved the sale of Black Hawk helicopters to Mexico, a deal worth $225 million, and was chasing other orders. The Air Force had awarded Boeing Co a contract to build 141 rescue helicopters based on its twin-rotor CH-47 “Chinook” design in 2006, but the deal was protested immediately by the losing bidders - Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin Corp  - and later canceled by then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The Air Force restarted the program in 2012, but Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp and Europe’s Airbus later dropped out of the competition, arguing that the Air Force had skewed the requirements to favor Sikorsky’s helicopter.

425,UTX,U.S. grounds entire F-35 fleet pending engine inspections,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military said it had grounded the entire fleet of 97 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets until completion of additional inspections of the warplane’s single engine built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. The Pentagon’s F-35 program office, Air Force and Navy issued directives on Thursday ordering the suspension of all F-35 flights after a June 23 fire on an Air Force F-35A jet at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The Pentagon said U.S. and industry officials had not pinpointed the cause of the fire, which occurred as a pilot was preparing for takeoff. The pilot was not injured. The incident is the latest to hit the Pentagon’s costliest weapons program, the $398.6 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It followed an in-flight oil leak that triggered mandatory fleetwide inspections of the jets last month. “Additional inspections of F-35 engines have been ordered, and return to flight will be determined based on inspection results and analysis of engineering data,” the Defense Department said in a brief statement issued late on Thursday. Pratt & Whitney said it was working closely with Air Force officials who are investigating the fire and are inspecting all engines in the fleet. Spokesman Jay DeFrank said it would be inappropriate to comment further since the incident was the subject of an investigation. The Pentagon’s F-35 program office has made determining the cause of the fire its highest priority and it is assessing the impact on flight tests, training and operations of the radar-evading warplane. A person familiar with the situation said it was premature to rule in or out any quality problem or manufacturing defect. Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera he wanted to discuss the F-35 problem when he visits the United States next week to tour U.S. bases and meet with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. “On my coming trip to the U.S. I plan to be reviewing troops and will have a chance to discuss the F-35 development on the ground,” Onodera told a regular news conference. “I’d like to confirm the details of this accident.” Japan has ordered 42 of the single-engine stealth jets that will be assembled locally by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, maker of the World War II-era Zero fighter. Tokyo may order more F-35s when it decides the future of 100 of its older F-15s. Australia and South Korea said there had been no change to their plans to buy the fighter jets. Australia plans to buy 58 of the fighters and South Korea intends to buy 40.  “To date the JSF aircraft has accrued 15,000 flight hours While the F135 engine has successfully completed nearly 32,000 hours of testing,” a spokesman for Australia’s Defense Minister David Johnston said. “Single engine fighters are operated by many air forces and Defense remains confident the F-35 JSF will be reliable and safe.” Reuters reported on Wednesday that U.S. and British authorities were preparing directives ordering a mandatory engine inspection estimated to take about 90 minutes. British officials remained part of the discussions with U.S. officials and concurred with the U.S. recommendation to ground the jets, pending further inspection results, the F-35 program office said. The Pentagon said preparations were continuing for F-35 jets to participate in two UK air shows later this month, but a final decision would be made early next week. The fire has already derailed plans for an F-35 jet to fly by a naming ceremony for Britain’s new aircraft carrier on Friday.

The company also cut its cash flow forecast for the year, while analysts said higher-than-expected second-quarter profit was muddied by uncertainty over one-time gains and losses. Shares of United Tech, a Dow index member whose products serve the aerospace and commercial building sectors, were off 1.9 percent in mid-day trading, while those of most rival manufacturers traded higher.  “A little bit slower order growth may have spooked some people,” Edward Jones analyst Christian Mayes said. “We have had strong growth the last few quarters and it slowed down a bit.” Orders at Otis increased 3 percent but they were essentially unchanged in China, where the company is seeking to capitalize on rising urban populations. United Tech Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes noted that a year ago, orders at Otis had risen 39 percent in China, making for a difficult comparison this quarter. Analysts have been concerned that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could undermine United Tech’s commercial building business, which also includes air conditioners and security systems. “The Chinese economy is cooling a little bit,” Hayes said on a conference call with analysts. At Pratt, orders for commercial spare engines slumped 6 percent, reversing course after rising 11 percent in the first quarter. Sales at Pratt also slipped 0.9 percent. The unit is introducing a new engine expected to propel growth for years to come. United Tech’s second-quarter net income rose 8 percent to $1.68 billion, or $1.84 per share. Analysts on average were looking for $1.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Although EPS was a beat in the quarter, we think results on an underlying basis were essentially in-line,” with various one-time items clouding expectations, RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a research note.     Revenue rose 7 percent to $17.19 billion. United Tech’s revenue increased 3 percent on an organic basis, which excludes sales from a helicopter agreement with Canada and net divestitures.  The company said last month that it had signed a revamped agreement to provide Canada with maritime helicopters from its Sikorsky unit, with the deal leading to higher revenue in the second quarter but also to a $438 million charge to earnings. United Tech’s aerospace components unit, UTC Aerospace Systems, was a bright spot in the quarter, with spare part orders jumping 28 percent.  United Tech projected 2014 earnings of $6.75 to $6.85 per share, raising the low end from $6.65.

435,UTX,United States to sell Tunisia 12 Black Hawks to aid militant fight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is planning to sell Tunisia a dozen advanced attack helicopters as Washington seeks to help the North African state stamp out a mounting threat from Islamist militants.  “We asked the United States to give us about 12 Black Hawks,” Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki said during a speech on Tuesday at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. “We badly need them now,” he said.  The Obama administration is planning to sell Tunisia 12 UH-60M Black Hawks for a total estimated cost of $700 million, according to a notice posted late last month by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, a U.S government agency that manages arms sales. The aircraft would be equipped with Hellfire missiles, machine guns and other sophisticated military technology, according to the agency. The sale requires consent of Congress. The Black Hawk is built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp.  Tunisia, where the revolutions that have transformed the Arab world in recent years began, is in many ways more stable and secure than other Arab Spring countries such as Libya and Syria.  But Tunisia is facing a militant threat of its own, mostly due to attacks mounted by the al Qaeda offshoot Ansar al-Sharia and to a flow of fighters and weapons unleashed by other conflicts in the region. Since April, thousands of troops have been deployed to Tunisia’s mountainous Chaambi region on the border with Algeria, where fighters fleeing a French military intervention in Mali last year have taken refuge. At least 15 soldiers have been killed in attacks on military checkpoints in the area. Tunisia’s capital, Tunis, was the site of an attack on the U.S. embassy in September 2012.  “We didn’t expect that Tunisia would become a country where (we) would have these terrorist attacks like in Syria,” said Marzouki, who was in Washington for a summit between U.S and African leaders. “We were a little bit naive.”  Marzouki said the Tunisian military also required training and other equipment such as night vision goggles.  “It’s a matter of urgency,” he said, suggesting the period ahead of Tunisia’s upcoming elections could be subject to renewed violence. Tunisians are due to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections this fall.

Pratt said on Friday it discovered conflicting documentation in late May that raised questions about the origin of the titanium, which was also used in parts for engines made by its Pratt & Whitney Canada division. The Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 strike fighter is the Pentagon’s costliest weapons program. Pratt determined very quickly that the material did not pose a flight safety risk, company spokesman Matthew Bates said in an emailed statement. “While the tested material may not meet every Pratt & Whitney material control standard, our engine designs have significant amounts of margin and, based on our engineering assessments, such material does not pose a risk to safety of flight,” Bates said. Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program office, agreed that the material does not pose a risk to flight safety and said the part “will be replaced by attrition.” Bates said Pratt reported its concerns at the time to the U.S. Pentagon’s Defense Criminal Investigation Services unit, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the U.S. Attorney’s Office. A federal investigation is being conducted into the source of the titanium, whose origin remains unknown, DellaVedova said. Pratt said it was no longer accepting parts made from material provided by the supplier, A&P; Alloys. A&P; Alloys did not immediately respond to requests for comment late on Friday.  Bloomberg News initially reported the titanium issue. Engine deliveries for the F-35 program have been suspended since a separate June 23 incident, in which the engine on an Air Force training jet broke apart and caught fire just before takeoff from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Company and military officials are investigating the cause of the Eglin incident. Bates said that Pratt and has a potential fix and plans to conduct tests next month.

Pratt determined very quickly that the material did not pose a flight safety risk, company spokesman Matthew Bates said in an emailed statement. “While the tested material may not meet every Pratt & Whitney material control standard, our engine designs have significant amounts of margin and, based on our engineering assessments, such material does not pose a risk to safety of flight,” Bates said. Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program office, agreed that the material does not pose a risk to flight safety and said the part “will be replaced by attrition.” Bates said Pratt reported its concerns at the time to the U.S. Pentagon’s Defense Criminal Investigation Services unit, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the U.S. Attorney’s Office. A federal investigation is being conducted into the source of the titanium, whose origin remains unknown, DellaVedova said. Pratt said it was no longer accepting parts made from material provided by the supplier, A&P; Alloys. A&P; Alloys did not immediately respond to requests for comment late on Friday. Bloomberg News initially reported the titanium issue. Engine deliveries for the F-35 program have been suspended since a separate June 23 incident, in which the engine on an Air Force training jet broke apart and caught fire just before takeoff from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Company and military officials are investigating the cause of the Eglin incident. Bates said that Pratt and has a potential fix and plans to conduct tests next month.

444,UTX,Pratt to start testing F-35 engine fix this week: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) this week will begin testing a design change to fix the problem that caused a massive engine failure on a Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet in June, according to two sources familiar with the program. The failure of Pratt & Whitney’s F135 engine grounded the entire F-35 fleet for several weeks this summer and prevented the newest and most advanced U.S. warplane from making its international debut at two UK air shows. Flights have resumed but with certain restrictions on speed and other maneuvers. Deliveries of the F135 engine by Pratt, a unit of United Technologies, have been on hold since the June 23 incident at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida when an engine on an Air Force F-35A broke apart and caught fire as it was preparing to take off for a training flight. The sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said the testing would be done at Pratt’s facility in West Palm Beach, Florida after weeks of preliminary work. The tests had been expected to start last week, but were delayed while engineers grappled with how to control the vibration of the engine as it was being tested, according to one of the sources. Pratt spokesman Matthew Bates said the company would conduct engine and rig testing this month to validate the suspected root cause of the engine failure and test a proposed solution. Bates said the company was working on a solution that would allow the fleet of F-35 test aircraft to resume the full range of flight tests in the near term. Pratt was also working on tests that would clarify what changes were needed for the fleet of operational jets. As of Sept. 2, the Pentagon’s F-35 program office said it had 84 training jets and 19 test aircraft for a total F-35 fleet of 103 jets. Bates said the company hoped to share more details about the proposed fix when the tests were completed. He said Pratt also hoped to wrap up talks soon with the Pentagon about the next two batches of engines. “We look forward to concluding our negotiations for the 7th and 8th lot of engines shortly,” Bates said.

448,UTX,REUTERS SUMMIT-Pratt sees clarity on 'root cause' of F-35 engine issue by end Sept.,"(Adds military comments) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s  Pratt & Whitney unit said the “root cause” of the June 23 engine failure on a Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet should be clear by the end of September, which would pave the way for over $1 billion in contracts for another 84 engines. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said it has delivered six of its F135 engines to the U.S. government since Aug. 29, when it resumed deliveries that had been halted after the June incident which grounded the F-35 fleet for weeks and prevented its international debut. Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt & Whitney Military Engines, said he still hoped to keep the government’s flight test plan on track through a series of measures aimed at addressing the issue and lifting restrictions on test aircraft. “I believe that through the combination of things we will keep the flight test program on track,” Croswell told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit. Separately at the Reuters summit, officials from the military and Lockheed echoed the timeline for identifying the cause of the engine incident. “We’re reasonably confident we’re looking at the right thing, and then we’re reasonably confident it’s going to prove out in the next couple of weeks,” Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, deputy director of the F-35 program, told the summit. In June, an Air Force F-35A training jet caught fire after its Pratt engine broke apart and ripped a fuel line as the jet prepared to take off from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. U.S. officials blame the incident on excessive rubbing of part of the engine’s fan section against an adjacent seal. The incident has raised fresh concerns about the $400 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon’s largest-ever arms program, which is about 70 percent over initial cost estimates and years behind schedule. U.S. officials say the program is back on track after earlier problems, although Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan last week said the engine issue had put the development program about 30 to 45 days behind schedule. Croswell said Pratt was taking the issue very seriously and expected it to be resolved “in relatively short order.” He also noted that such problems were meant to be found during the design and development phase of any new program. The fix should be moderate in cost, Croswell said. “It should not be a very expensive solution,” he said, noting that retrofits would be possible without an expensive tear-apart of the F-35’s powerful engine. Croswell said Pratt had essentially wrapped up negotiations with the Pentagon on the 84 engines in the seventh and eighth low rate production contracts, but Bogdan wanted a clearer understanding of the root cause of the incident before signing off on an agreement valued at over $1 billion. The Pentagon is negotiating a separate contract with Lockheed for an eighth batch of jets. Croswell confirmed that Pratt would pay to fix the current issue and said the company had also agreed to share in the cost of future problems, but details were still being finalized. “We have agreed in principle to provide a warranty to the U.S. government for future LRIP contracts. We have not yet finalized a warranty agreement, but P&W; would likely pay a percentage of the total cost of certain performance specification shortfalls,” spokesman Matthew Bates said. Croswell said the engine failure came about eight hours after an unusual maneuver involving a roll, yaw and heavy gravity loads during sharp turns. “This is a maneuver that the engine should be able to withstand,” he said. Croswell said Pratt had already completed a baseline test  of the current engine at its West Palm Beach, Florida facility, and had begun testing possible fixes. He said the company was investigating whether the density of the polyimide, a rubbery material made by Dupont, had played a role. The part that broke apart ties the fan blades together. It is made by Cobham Plc, Croswell said.

449,UTX,Pentagon sees F-35 contract soon with Lockheed,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department on Tuesday said it expects to wrap up contract talks in coming days or weeks with Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) about an eighth batch of F-35 fighter jets, and is also close to an agreement with engine maker Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N). Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, deputy F-35 program manager, said the department had decided to negotiate the next two production contracts with Lockheed at the same time to secure better pricing given the higher order quantities. Those contracts would still be awarded to the company one year at a time given restrictions on multi-year contracts, he added. Mahr said the overall F-35 program, the Pentagon’s largest arms project, was doing “pretty well,” but he continued to worry about the pace of retrofitting existing jets to fix problems discovered during flight testing.

452,UTX,"UPDATE 1-EU delays new Russia sanctions, to meet on Thursday","* Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation on the sanctions list * Italy, Finland, reluctant to go ahead with new sanctions   (Updates with Mogherini quotes, background on sanctions) By Julia Fioretti and Markus Wacket BRUSSELS/BERLIN, Sept 10 (Reuters) - European Union envoys failed on Wednesday to reach a decision on whether to implement new sanctions against Russia over military involvement in the war in Ukraine and will meet for talks on Thursday, EU diplomats said. The diplomats said that while Germany was pushing to have the sanctions implemented, several other EU countries wanted to hold off because a ceasefire in Ukraine was holding. “Some countries are asking for time,” Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini, who has been chosen to be the EU’s new foreign policy chief, told reporters in Brussels, declining to say who those countries were. “Unity in this is absolutely crucial and strategic,” she said. EU diplomats said that countries with close ties to Russia such as Italy, Austria and Finland are reluctant to implement the new sanctions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for the sanctions to go ahead, adding that they could always be suspended at a later date if there was progress towards a peace plan for Ukraine. “We are in favour of making these sanctions public now,” Merkel told the German parliament. Ukraine’s president said on Wednesday Russia had removed the bulk of its forces from his country, raising hopes for a peace drive now underway after five months of conflict in which more than 3,000 people have been killed. EU diplomats said, however, that the general idea was still for the sanctions to be implemented through publication in the Official Journal of the European Union on Friday. The EU sanctions list dated Sept.6 shows battle-tank maker Uralvagonzavod, aerospace company Oboronprom and state-controlled United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) are among Russian companies to face new EU sanctions if the bloc decides to implement them, according to a draft obtained by Reuters. Oboronprom is the main shareholder in Russia’s top producer of civilian and military helicopters: Russian Helicopters. Uralvagonzavod is a maker of Russian battle-tanks. UAC was created by Russian President Vladimir Putin during his 2000-2008 presidency to be a national champion for plane manufacturing. The EU sanctions would prohibit the companies from raising capital in Europe via “financial instruments with a maturity exceeding 30 days”, the draft document said. Moscow has lobbied for a delay in the implementation of new sanctions. Russia’s ambassador spoke to the head of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, who chairs EU summits, and the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton on Monday, diplomats said. His message was that the EU should look at what was happening on the ground in Ukraine and reflect on its position that the ceasefire was holding. One of the difficulties in making a decision on sanctions implementation is that the EU has no agreed way to establish if the ceasefire in Ukraine is holding - it is up to individual governments to make their own assessment.

The document in federal court in New York said the secrets were “properly classified national security information” which would be described in another filing that would not be made public. Greek businessman and ship owner Victor Restis last year sued UANI for defamation after UANI, whose advisors include former intelligence officials from the United States, Europe and Israel, accused him of violating sanctions on Iran by exporting oil from the country. UANI advocates economic pressure on Iran to keep over its nuclear program. Iran denies Western accusations that it has been seeking the capability to assemble nuclear weapons. One of UANI’s tactics is to name and shame companies and people who do business in Iran. In an emailed statement, UANI’s lawyer said he believed Restis’ complaint was without merit. Restis’ lawyer declined to comment before filing a formal response in court. Earlier this year, U.S. government lawyers declared their interest in the lawsuit, warning that information related to UANI could jeopardize law enforcement activities such as ongoing investigations. The state secrets privilege is more powerful than the one the government would have used to protect law enforcement activities. It refers specifically to matters of national security. It is used far more sparingly than the law enforcement privilege. In Friday’s court filing U.S. Department of Justice lawyers pointed to another example in which the government invoked it to try to dismiss a defamation lawsuit in 1985 by a man claiming Penthouse Magazine had wrongly accused him of being a spy. The case is Restis et al v. American Coalition Against Nuclear Iran Inc, (dba United Against A Nuclear Iran) et al, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 13-05032.

456,UTX,GE exec says avoided geared design in jet engine battle with Pratt,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) avoided using a geared design for its new engine for narrowbody jets because of concerns about weight and reliability, said a top GE executive on Monday as it battles with rival Pratt & Whitney for billions of dollars in engine orders. Pratt, part of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), developed a geared turbofan that relies on a gearbox and lets the front fan operate at a different speed than the rest of the engine, while on GE’s traditionally configured engines the fans run at the same speed. Speaking at a Morgan Stanley investor conference, GE Chief Technology Officer Mark Little said the company had “considered a geared approach ... and we chose very consciously not to take that approach.” “Some other application someday, maybe, but not for this one,” Little said at the conference in Dana Point, California, that was broadcast over the Internet. Through its joint venture called CFM with France’s Safran (SAF.PA), GE is competing against Pratt for airline and other customers that choose Airbus’ (AIR.PA) new A320neo single-aisle plane. Both engines promise significant fuel savings over older models, and Airbus buyers can choose the Pratt or CFM engine.     CFM’s LEAP, among other improvements, uses new materials designed to reduce weight and add durability. “We thought that the addition of the extra component would add reliability and weight challenges, and durability challenges that we could avoid by going the path we went,” Little said. “We like the bet that we’ve made,” Little said. In response to Little’s comments, Pratt & Whitney spokeswoman Sara Banda said: “We are confident in our PurePower Geared Turbofan engine technology and this is not just us saying this,” noting that in addition to Airbus, four other aircraft makers have selected the GTF, including Embraer (EMBR3.SA) and Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO). Pratt has completed more than 10,000 hours of testing for the GTF engine family, Banda said in an email, after 20 years of research and $1 billion invested into developing the engine. Barry Eccleston, president of Airbus Americas Inc, told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense summit last week that of A320neo customers, so far about one-third have chosen the LEAP, one-third have selected the GTF, while one-third remain undecided. Pratt has had a smaller presence among commercial engines in recent years, so the GTF engine is its bid to return to prominence. By contrast, CFM has been the dominant engine on the narrowbody planes, including capturing a major portion of the new narrow-body market because it is the sole engine on Boeing Co’s (BA.N) 737 MAX.  The geared engine architecture won a vote of confidence in February, when Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR.L) also said it was pursuing such an approach for its future engines. Airbus has said the first A320neo flight, which will use Pratt’s GTF engine, is expected sometime this month.

458,UTX,UPDATE 1-Pratt says next F-35 engine deals will cut costs by 7-8 pct,"(Adds details) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, said its contracts with the Pentagon for the next two batches of engines for the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet will result in combined cost savings of 7 percent to 8 percent. Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt’s military engines division, told reporters the company had already more than halved the cost of its F-35 engine, and the savings from the next two contracts - for the seventh and eighth batches of engines - would come on top of that. Croswell, speaking at the annual Air Force Association conference, said Pratt had essentially reached agreement with the Pentagon on the next low-rate production contracts, which will be worth over $1 billion. He said Pratt expected that by the end of the month it would be able to validate the root cause of an engine failure that grounded the entire F-35 fleet for several weeks this summer. He said 20-odd test F-35 aircraft should then be modified with a fix for the engine issue by the end of the year. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan said the Pentagon was looking at six possible solutions for solving the engine issue, which was caused by excessive rubbing of a component against an adjacent seal in the fan section of the engine. He said the engine failure had caused a delay of 30 to 45 days in the development program, but he still believed the Marine Corps would be able to start using its jets in combat by mid-July 2015, as planned, since the program had included some flexibility in its schedule plan.

461,UTX,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Airbus conducts maiden flight of hot-selling A320neo,"(Corrects name of United Technologies unit in penultimate para) * Airbus expects 3,500 A320neo sales by year end * Boeing bringing out updated version of rival 737 By Tim Hepher TOULOUSE, France, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Airbus  successfully staged the maiden test flight on Thursday of an upgraded passenger jet on which it expects to generate hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue, buoyed by an increase in the company’s jet demand forecast. The A320neo touched down in Toulouse, southwest France, 27 years after the original A320 first took to the skies and opened up fierce competition with Boeing’s medium-haul 737 in a slice of the jet market estimated at $2 trillion over 20 years. Powered by a new type of jet engine from Pratt & Whitney , the A320neo flew for two hours and 22 minutes, kicking off a year of flight trials. The same family of aircraft will also offer a competing engine from CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and Safran. Airbus is aiming for savings of 15 percent per seat compared with the current generation of medium-haul passenger jets. It said this gap would increase to 20 percent by 2020 thanks in part to a further two percent improvement due to be delivered by Pratt & Whitney, on top of its 12 percent contribution to the current improvement. The rest will come by adding more seats. With airlines running on wafer-thin profit margins and spending about 40 percent of their operating costs on fuel, such savings are at the centre of a huge sales battle. Rival Boeing is bringing out its own updated version of the 737 just over a year after Airbus and the two companies face a gradual threat to their duopoly at the small end of the market from new competitors in Canada, Brazil, China and Russia. A smooth entry to service will however cement their position as market leaders for years to come, analysts say, Shares in both companies have risen sharply since the decision to revamp their most-sold aircraft was announced in 2010 and 2011. Airbus shares rose over 2 percent on Thursday. Airbus has sold 3,257 A320neo aircraft and said it expects this to reach 3,500 by the end of the year. Together, Airbus and Boeing have sold well over 5,000 of the planes. Both companies have announced increases in production as a result, and are considering further increases to lift A320 or 737 production to 50 planes a month or beyond. Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier however said it was  in “no rush” to make a further output decision. Airbus raised its 20-year forecast for jet demand on Wednesday, citing growth in emerging markets, with China on the brink of becoming the world’s aviation powerhouse. The flight went ahead in September as planners hoped after last-minute signs of concern about the engine’s readiness and the recent resumption of flight tests on Bombardier’s  CSeries aircraft, which uses similar Pratt & Whitney engines. An engine blowout in May had halted CSeries flight testing. The companies indicated they were convinced that the Airbus version of the engine would not be affected by the same problems and that the aircraft would enter service with the same high reliability as the existing generation of small jets. “It is a great engine that is going to change the economics of the airline industry,” said Alain Bellemare, chief executive of UTC Propulsion and Aerospace Systems at Pratt & Whitney parent United Technologies. “We are highly confident in the performance of these engines,” he told Reuters.

462,UTX,F-35 jet combat ready next year despite engine fix - Lockheed,"* F-35A seen combat ready by mid-2015 * Pratt & Whitney to implement engine fix early 2015 * Expected higher orders will drive down per-unit cost-exec OSLO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin expects the cost of the F-35 fighter jet to drop to its target level by 2019 and still sees the first version of the aircraft combat ready by mid-2015, despite an engine fire which still needs a fix, the firm said on Thursday. A decision by South Korea on Wednesday to order 40 F-35s for around $7 billion further lowers the programme’s cost and Lockheed sees the per-unit cost down to $80-$85 million by 2019 from the current rate of around $115 million, Jeff Babione, Lockheed’s deputy general manager for the F-35 programme told reporters in Oslo. Lockheed, engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and other suppliers are investing heavily to drive down the programme’s projected $400 billion cost, making it more affordable for cash-strapped governments looking to buy over 3,100 aircraft over the next decades. “The cost reduction will come with the increase in orders,” Babione told Reuters on the sidelines of a press conference. “We anticipate that there’s a market out there for 4,000 airplanes ... and the biggest risk to cost is if we don’t get the orders we showed. That will significantly erode our ability to take advantage of economic order quantities and reduce cost.” The F-35 programme was set back earlier this year when the Pentagon grounded its entire fleet after a June 23 fire on an Air Force F-35A jet, an all new aircraft with advanced stealth capabilities, improved manoeuvrability and advanced sensors. Lockheed is still investigating the issue and expects to determine the root cause this month or early October, and sees a fix implemented on aircraft already in service in early 2015, Chris Flynn, a Pratt & Whitney vice-president for the F-35 engine programme said. “We understand what fundamentally happened ... and we have tremendous confidences in the timeline,” Flynn said. “We think it’s a fairly straightforward fix.” Though no longer grounded, the fleet of over 100 F-35s already delivered, flies under restrictions, pending the engine fix. Lockheed added it was also confident that the U.S. Marine Corps would declare the first version of the jet combat ready by mid-2015 and said that beside the engine issue, the integration of the communication systems and the subtle changes to flight controls were its main issues.

463,UTX,UPDATE 1-Pratt & Whitney names new commercial head amid launch of jet engine,"(Adds Pratt president, analyst comments, details on announcement, background) By Lewis Krauskopf Oct 2 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s Pratt & Whitney unit on Thursday named a new head of its commercial engines division in the midst of a crucial launch of a commercial jet engine. Pratt appointed Gregory Gernhardt as president of Pratt & Whitney Commercial Engines, effective immediately. He replaces David Brantner, who was named to the commercial engine leadership post in June 2013. Brantner “has decided to depart the company,” Pratt said in a statement. Industry sources who declined to be named said Brantner is leaving voluntarily for a senior position at another aerospace company and had not been pushed out. Pratt’s new geared turbofan, or GTF, is helping revitalize its commercial engine business. The engine is offered on Airbus’  A320neo narrow-body plane, which had its maiden flight last week, and other new jets. Pratt has invested $1 billion developing the engine, which has more than 6,000 orders and commitments. Gernhardt, 49, previously was responsible for the engine’s A320neo program, seen as the GTF’s most important program. In a statement, Pratt President Paul Adams said Gernhardt was “well prepared” for his new role and brings “demonstrated leadership capabilities honed during 25 years of engine experience in engineering, program management, sales and customer service.” Given the large backlog of orders, one issue Pratt could face is whether it can ramp up production quickly and smoothly, analysts have said. Aside from the GTF, Pratt is a major military contractor and provides the engine for Lockheed Martin Corp’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon’s largest-ever arms program. On the A320neo, Pratt’s GTF is competing with the LEAP engine from CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co  and France’s Safran. Both engines promise significant fuel savings over older models, and Airbus buyers can choose the Pratt or CFM engine. Another version of the GTF is being used to power Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft. The Bombardier plane suffered an on-ground engine failure in May, but test flights resumed last month. Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group, said it was notable that the leadership change happened after the first A320neo flight and the resumption of flying for the CSeries, and it was not something that should alarm customers. “If you were going to make a career move, you’d wait until you checked two boxes like this,” Aboulafia said. “I don’t think there’s any overhang from this.” United Tech shares closed down 0.6 percent at $103.24 on the New York Stock Exchange.

472,UTX,Exclusive: Boeing eyes possible Chinook helicopter sale to Brazil,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Brazilian Army has expressed interest in buying a handful of Boeing Co (BA.N) CH-47 Chinook helicopters, the company said on Wednesday, saying that it continued to view Brazil as an important partner for defense and commercial projects.  “We have had some early discussions about the Chinook with the Brazilian Army,” Boeing spokesman Scott Day said, when asked about a potential CH-47 sale to Brazil. Day declined to give any details, but said the potential order was “not a large one.” Ties between the United States and Brazil are starting to recover from deep strains caused last year after documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden showed that Washington had spied on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and other world leaders. After the incident, Roussef canceled a state visit to the United States and Brazil scrapped plans to buy Boeing F/A-18 fighter jets, but the Brazilian leader has since indicated she is ready to move on. The State Department has already approved several other possible U.S. weapons sales to Brazil this year, calling the country “an important force for political stability and economic progress in South America.” The potential weapons deals include a $169 million deal for 16 AGM-84L Harpoon missiles, also built by Boeing; 40 upgrade kits for M109A5 self-propelled howitzers built by the U.S. unit of BAE Systems (BAES.L); and three UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), in a deal valued at about $145 million. Day said Boeing viewed the Chinook discussions with Brazil as “pretty positive” and said the company believed the workhorse twin-rotor helicopters would provide the Brazilian army a lot of good capacity. “We still view Brazil as a very important country for Boeing,” he said. Chris Raymond, vice president of business development for Boeing’s defense division, declined to comment on the possible Chinook sale to Brazil after an event in Washington on Tuesday evening. But he underscored the company’s continued commitment to the Brazilian market, highlighting a broad partnership agreement that the company signed with Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer (EMBR3.SA), and its decision to open an office in Sao Paolo.

473,UTX,"United Technologies posts broad revenue, order growth","(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) on Tuesday posted increases in revenue and orders across its aerospace and commercial building segments, helping dispel some concerns about a shaky global economy pressuring its performance. However, the diversified U.S. manufacturer suggested that profit next year could increase at a lower rate than analysts had expected. The maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators said third-quarter revenue rose 4.6 percent, while orders increased across its main business segments.  “Clearly, the world is not ending,” United Tech Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said in an interview. “What we really saw was organic growth across all of the businesses in all of our regions.” Like those of rivals, United Tech shares have underperformed the broader market due to concerns about the global economy. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI component's stock was up 1.9 percent at $103.37 in midday trading after rising as much as 2.5 percent. The stock may have given back some of its gains after Hayes told analysts on a conference call that the company expected earnings next year to rise by a mid-single-digit percentage rate. Analysts on average have been expecting an increase of 8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. “They seem to be comfortable setting a low bar and trying to beat it,” said S&P; Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore. United Technologies “is in the sweet spot right now,” Corridore said, due to a boom in commercial aerospace building and strong commercial construction trends, particularly in the United States. The company has been looking for large acquisitions but has not found a major deal it wants. “We want to look for acquisitions in the core that can actually move the needle,” Hayes said, “and there just aren’t that many properties out there, and the properties we do like are relatively expensive.” Instead, the company on Tuesday increased the amount of stock it expects to buy back this year, to $1.5 billion worth from $1.35 billion. The shares are “relatively attractive vis-a-vis some of the acquisitions out there,” Hayes said.     United Tech said third-quarter net income rose 29.5 percent to $1.85 billion, or $2.04 per share, helped by a tax settlement. The company said earnings were $1.82 per share, excluding favorable items and restructuring costs. Analysts on average were looking for $1.81, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

477,UTX,Pratt wins $1.05 billion U.S. deal for 48 more F-35 engines,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Engine maker Pratt & Whitney on Thursday said it had won a contract to build an eighth batch of 48 engines for the F-35 fighter jet built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), bringing the total value of the deal to $1.05 billion. Pratt, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), said the new contract was for $793 million, on top of $259 million in preliminary funds awarded and would lower the average cost of the engines between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, program executive officer for the Pentagon’s F-35 program, welcomed the cost cuts in the new contract, which follow an average 4.4 percent cost reduction in the seventh batch of engines. The cumulative reduction of about 9 percent in the two contracts showed Pratt’s renewed commitment to the “war on cost” it initiated several years ago, Bogdan told reporters at the headquarters of the F-35 program. He said he would continue to press the company for further cuts in the cost of the F135 engine that powers the newest and most advanced U.S. warplane. Neither Pratt nor the Pentagon disclosed the specific cost of each engine under the new contract.  Chris Flynn, who runs the F135 and F119 engine programs for Pratt, said the company and its suppliers remained focused on pushing the price even lower and meeting the goals outlined in the company’s cost reduction initiative. “Pratt & Whitney and our supply base remain focused on delivering the F135 propulsion system on or below the cost targets we committed to for our customer,” Flynn said in a statement.  Bogdan said the Pentagon planned to negotiate separate contracts with both Lockheed and Pratt for the ninth and tenth batches of jets and engines in coming months, with a goal of reaching agreement with the companies by the fall of 2015. He reaffirmed the program’s goal of reaching a price tag of $80 million to $85 million per aircraft by 2019. In addition, he said the Pentagon and Lockheed expected to generate “substantial” cost reductions in the F-35 fighter jets being sold to foreign countries by combining their cumulative orders instead of negotiating one year of orders at a time. That meant that U.S. allies who participated in such a “block buy” could for a time see lower F-35 prices than the U.S. military, which must meet certain strict conditions set by Congress to enable multiyear purchases, Bogdan said. In later years, once the F-35 reaches full-rate production, the U.S. military could also shift to multiyear contracts. The changes could drive the cost of the aircraft even lower than the current target of $80 million to $85 million, he said. Bogdan said he was confident that Pratt and the Pentagon had solutions in place that would allow the program to resume normal flight operations after a massive engine failure on June 23 that grounded the entire F-35 fleet for several weeks this summer.

Edward Kangas, lead independent director, will take the post of non-executive chairman. “This has come out of the blue, and as far as we know was not planned,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard, one of several analysts who expressed surprise at the move. Shares of United Tech, a Dow Jones industrials index component, fell 1.1 percent to $109.12 in morning trading. After a big run in 2013, the stock has fallen some 3 percent this year. Chenevert spent 22 years at United Tech after arriving from General Motors (GM.N). After running Pratt & Whitney for seven years, he became chief operating officer before ascending to the CEO role in 2008. A signature move of his tenure was the $16 billion acquisition of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp, announced in 2011. That deal tilted United Tech more toward an aerospace company and away from the other major area of the  company that sells elevators, climate control systems and security products for commercial buildings. Since March, Hayes and other executives have suggested United Tech was interested in a major acquisition in the buildings area. Hayes, 54, is familiar to Wall Street, as the main presenter on earnings conference calls and at investor events held by brokerages. “We view Greg Hayes as highly qualified to lead United Technologies and as someone who understands investors and communicates with them effectively,” JPMorgan analyst Joseph Nadol said in a research note.

486,UTX,"UPDATE 1-New UTC chief known to Wall Street, giving solace amid abrupt move","(Adds Chenevert comment) By Lewis Krauskopf Nov 24 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s  appointment of Chief Financial Officer Gregory Hayes as chief executive is providing investors some comfort as they try to understand the abrupt departure of previous leader Louis Chenevert. United Technologies shares fell 1.4 percent on Monday after the company announced that Chenevert had stepped down as CEO and chairman effective immediately. The maker of jet engines, elevators and climate control systems gave no public indication of the transition ahead of time, catching Wall Street off guard. In Hayes, known as the company’s “voice” to Wall Street, United Tech has elevated their top finance executive who has been a regular presence before investors on company conference calls and at events. “I’m comfortable that ... he’s a known quantity in the investment community,” said Keith Davis, principal at investment management firm Farr, Miller & Washington, which holds about 250,000 United Tech shares. “I’m not comfortable with the fact that we don’t have more information on why the change was made,” Davis said. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co who has followed United Tech since the 1970s, said of Chenevert: “To resign cold turkey with no lead has people a little bit confused.” Hayes was not available for interviews on Monday, a company spokesman said. In an emailed statement, Chenevert told Reuters he was “proud of the transformation of the company during my tenure.” “United Technologies is in a terrific position to grow as a result of the work done by Greg, myself and UTC’s exceptional leadership team,” he said. “My wife and I look forward to the next chapter of our lives, and we are very happy to have more time to enjoy our family.” The 54-year old Hayes, an accountant and Purdue University graduate, joined the company in 1999 through the acquisition of Sunstrand, where he served as vice president of finance for Sunstrand Aerospace. He held several finance-related posts before being named CFO in 2008. Hayes is perceived to be a “conservative voice” on financial matters, said Scott Lawson, vice president of United Tech shareholder Westwood Holdings Group. On the company’s third-quarter conference call, Hayes said earnings next year would rise by a mid-single-digit percentage rate, below the average target of analysts. The company is next set to speak to investors at its annual outlook meeting on Dec. 11, an event that Chenevert led last year.

490,UTX,Breakingviews: United Tech shows way for other company boards,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Like company bosses themselves, boards sometimes think chief executives are indispensable. Not at United Technologies. Late last month, Louis Chenevert stepped down unexpectedly. It turns out he was spending too much time thinking about the construction of his yacht and other personal matters. Kudos to the company’s board for letting him go. The directors had a strong in-house replacement at hand in Gregory Hayes. That ensured that investors barely blinked at the changeover at the top of the $100 billion UTC, which makes Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, among other products. The main point, though, is that lead independent director Edward Kangas, now chairman, had enough courage and support from his fellow board members to challenge the CEO. Many boards only bring themselves to oust a company’s top executive - especially one who’s also chairman, as Chenevert was - when they are besieged by disgruntled investors and hounded by inquiring reporters. Kangas and his colleagues, in contrast, took the initiative. The Wall Street Journal reports that some senior managers and directors felt Chenevert was becoming more and more distracted. According to the newspaper, the final straw may have been a side trip the UTC boss took to Taiwan to check on the construction of his yacht. Getting financial incentives right isn’t sufficient. Chenevert’s reported compensation for 2013, after all, was $20 million. That should be enough to keep anyone focused. Separating the chairman’s job from the CEO’s is one way companies can help ensure that a chief executive remains committed. The title of chairman intuitively confers that kind of responsibility. The UTC example shows that a properly empowered lead director can also do the job. Either way, it’s a lesson for other boards in the importance of taking the lead on governance. -  Edward Kangas, United Technologies’ new chairman, said former Chief Executive Louis Chenevert stepped down late last month after Kangas, then lead independent director, spoke to him out of concern about his priorities. The U.S. aerospace and defense conglomerate’s Nov. 24 announcement came as a surprise to investors. - Kangas first made the comments in a Dec. 5 article in the Wall Street Journal. According to the article, which cited anonymous sources, there was concern among directors and senior managers at UTC that Chenevert was disengaged from the details of the company’s operations and too focused on private interests such as his yacht, which is under construction in Taiwan, according to the newspaper. - WSJ: UTC boss sails off after trip to yacht: on.wsj.com/1scy0Fe   (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

He was replaced as CEO by Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes, while Kangas, who had been lead independent director, became chairman. In comments provided by a company spokesman this weekend, Kangas said the situation “wasn’t a crisis.” “It was just a growing issue and concern which caused me, with counsel from the board, to discuss with Louis his priorities - personal and business,” Kangas said.  “After consideration, Louis concluded that the company was in a good place, had a great candidate to be the next CEO, and it was a good time for him to retire,” Kangas said, adding that the separation was “amicable.”  Kangas first made the comments in a Dec. 5 article in the Wall Street Journal.

498,UTX,New United Tech CEO to take stage amid Wall Street break-up talk,"(Reuters) - The change atop United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) has set off speculation the U.S. conglomerate may eventually shake up its diverse industrial businesses, including possibly divesting its Sikorsky helicopter unit. Shares of United Technologies have climbed 4 percent since the company announced on Nov. 24 that Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes replaced Louis Chenevert, who retired as chief executive officer, effective immediately.  The stock performance eclipsed a slight decline in the S&P; 500 index .SPX over that period, with investors saying Hayes could move to boost the stock, including taking a closer look at the structure of the company, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators. Well-known to Wall Street after serving as CFO for six years, Hayes will make his public debut as CEO on Thursday, when United Technologies details its 2015 financial outlook to investors and analysts at a meeting in New York. “My sense is that investors believe that a more engaged CEO will be more inclined to execute value-creating transactions, including the possible divestiture of Sikorsky,” said Keith Davis, principal at investment management firm Farr, Miller & Washington, which holds about 200,000 United Tech shares. While Hayes is not expected to announce specific moves, given that he just took the reins, Wall Street will look for signs he is open to change. “I think Hayes will indicate everything is under review, he’s not going to say what,” said Scott Lawson, vice president of investment management firm Westwood Holdings Group, which owns about 900,000 shares. “As an investor one would want him to be proactive in making sure UTX has the best portfolio possible.” United Tech shares have lagged those of Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) this year amid concerns about profit growth in 2015, and trade at a 3 percent discount to its rival on a forward price-to-earnings ratio basis, according to Thomson Reuters data. United Tech shares were off nearly 1 percent to $113.90 on Wednesday. One often-discussed option on Wall Street is the spinoff of Sikorsky, a major military contractor that makes Black Hawk helicopters. Credit Suisse analyst Julian Mitchell said this week that a Sikorsky disposal could help shares due in part to its margins, which are lower than those of other units. Mitchell said another strategic move could be to merge Pratt & Whitney with the civil engine business of Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR.L), while other analysts have floated the idea of splitting the company between its aerospace and commercial building businesses. To be sure, some investors want to first understand Hayes’ broader plan before seeking any shake-up. “Until Greg Hayes explains what is his strategic vision for UTX, it is difficult for us to judge whether divestitures are a good thing or not,” said Andrew Chan, assistant portfolio manager with Fiera Capital.

503,UTX,UTC sees profit below Street; to give portfolio 'disciplined' look,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) new chief executive on Thursday forecast 2015 profit below Wall Street’s target as profit falls at its Pratt & Whitney jet engine business, and said there were “no sacred cows” with the conglomerate’s businesses. In his debut as CEO after six years as the U.S. conglomerate’s finance chief, Greg Hayes said the company would look at the company’s portfolio in a “disciplined” way, following speculation on Wall Street that he might be open to shaking up the company’s structure. The future of Sikorsky, the maker of Black Hawk helicopters, has particularly been questioned, owning in part to its relatively low profit margins.  Hayes, speaking at a meeting of analysts and investors in New York, initially said: “We’re not going to sell Sikorsky.” But, later in the meeting, he said: “Anything is for sale at the right price.” “There’s no sacred cows out there,” Hayes told reporters after the meeting. Shares were down 1.8 percent in after-hours trading. Hayes also said he wanted to get more “aggressive” on acquisitions, with him personally getting more involved. He told reporters, “If there’s a $20, or even $30 billion deal out there, we’re not going to say no.” Although Pratt & Whitney is expecting a huge jump in production over the next five years, expenses tied to the production increase will hurt profit next year. The unit also faces pressures in its pension plans. “Pratt faces some significant headwinds on this ramp-up,” Hayes said. The company, which also makes Otis elevators and Carrier climate control systems, forecast 2015 earnings in a range of $7.00 to $7.20, growth of 3 percent to 6 percent.  It forecast sales for 2015 to be between $66 billion to $67 billion, including 3 to 5 percent organic growth. Analysts on average were looking for $7.27 per share on sales of $67.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Ahead of the meeting, many analysts and investors said they expected Hayes to be conservative with his initial forecast. The company expects share repurchases between $2 billion to $3 billion next year, with Hayes saying the stock is undervalued. The stock’s performance has “not been very good” in the past couple of years, Hayes said.  Hayes also praised his predecessor, Louis Chenevert, whose retirement as CEO announced on Nov. 24 stunned Wall Street. Chenevert “has really left us with a great hand,” Hayes said in opening comments.

504,UTX,United Tech CEO says widebody engine unlikely anytime soon,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) said on Thursday the company would not offer an engine for widebody planes anytime soon because of the difficult financial case for it. United Tech’s Pratt & Whitney unit is offering its new geared turbofan engine for smaller commercial airplanes, such as Airbus’ (AIR.PA) popular A320neo narrowbody jet, and some industry watchers have wondered if Pratt would seek to scale it up for larger planes. Speaking to reporters after the company’s outlook meeting, new United Tech CEO Greg Hayes said that “technically, we can do it,” but added: “We’re not going to do a widebody engine anytime soon, unless we can figure out a way to make the economics a helluva lot better than what they are.” “We could afford an investment in widebody,” Hayes said. “I think the drag on earnings would be significant for a number of years.” Typically, engine makers sell the engines at very low profit margins, while making that up in the maintenance and overhaul of those engines, known as the “aftermarket.” Widebody engines take off and land less frequently during a day than do engines for narrowbody planes, “so you’re not stressing the engine,” Hayes said. “As a result, the aftermarket potential I think on narrowbody is much greater than what it is on the widebody,” Hayes said. “That’s why our focus has been, let’s not play on 787. We’re not going to re-engine on the A380. And focus on the narrowbody where we think we can be successful,” Hayes said. During the meeting, the company said it was on track to certify the engine on the A320neo soon.

Speaking to reporters after the company’s outlook meeting, new United Tech CEO Greg Hayes said that “technically, we can do it,” but added: “We’re not going to do a widebody engine anytime soon, unless we can figure out a way to make the economics a helluva lot better than what they are.” “We could afford an investment in widebody,” Hayes said. “I think the drag on earnings would be significant for a number of years.” Typically, engine makers sell the engines at very low profit margins, while making that up in the maintenance and overhaul of those engines, known as the “aftermarket.” Widebody engines take off and land less frequently during a day than do engines for narrowbody planes, “so you’re not stressing the engine,” Hayes said. “As a result, the aftermarket potential I think on narrowbody is much greater than what it is on the widebody,” Hayes said. “That’s why our focus has been, let’s not play on 787. We’re not going to re-engine on the A380. And focus on the narrowbody where we think we can be successful,” Hayes said. During the meeting, the company said it was on track to certify the engine on the A320neo soon.

506,UTX,"UPDATE 2-UTC sees profit below Street; to give portfolio ""disciplined"" look","(Rewrites throughout, adds comments from CEO) By Lewis Krauskopf and Rohit T. K. Dec 11 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s new chief executive on Thursday forecast 2015 profit below Wall Street’s target as profit falls at its Pratt & Whitney jet engine business, and said there were “no sacred cows” with the conglomerate’s businesses. In his debut as CEO after six years as the U.S. conglomerate’s finance chief, Greg Hayes said the company would look at the company’s portfolio in a “disciplined” way, following speculation on Wall Street that he might be open to shaking up the company’s structure. The future of Sikorsky, the maker of Black Hawk helicopters, has particularly been questioned, owning in part to its relatively low profit margins. Hayes, speaking at a meeting of analysts and investors in New York, initially said: “We’re not going to sell Sikorsky.” But, later in the meeting, he said: “Anything is for sale at the right price.” “There’s no sacred cows out there,” Hayes told reporters after the meeting. Shares were down 1.8 percent in after-hours trading. Hayes also said he wanted to get more “aggressive” on acquisitions, with him personally getting more involved. He told reporters, “If there’s a $20, or even $30 billion deal out there, we’re not going to say no.” Although Pratt & Whitney is expecting a huge jump in production over the next five years, expenses tied to the production increase will hurt profit next year. The unit also faces pressures in its pension plans. “Pratt faces some significant headwinds on this ramp-up,” Hayes said. The company, which also makes Otis elevators and Carrier climate control systems, forecast 2015 earnings in a range of $7.00 to $7.20, growth of 3 percent to 6 percent. It forecast sales for 2015 to be between $66 billion to $67 billion, including 3 to 5 percent organic growth. Analysts on average were looking for $7.27 per share on sales of $67.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Ahead of the meeting, many analysts and investors said they expected Hayes to be conservative with his initial forecast. The company expects share repurchases between $2 billion to $3 billion next year, with Hayes saying the stock is undervalued. The stock’s performance has “not been very good” in the past couple of years, Hayes said. Hayes also praised his predecessor, Louis Chenevert, whose retirement as CEO announced on Nov. 24 stunned Wall Street. Chenevert “has really left us with a great hand,” Hayes said in opening comments.

507,UTX,U.S. watchdog questions if Air Force overpaying for F117 engine work,"WASHINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The Pentagon’s internal watchdog on Monday questioned whether the U.S. government is paying United Technologies Corp too much to maintain the F117 engines that power Boeing Co’s C-17 cargo plane, and it urged greater oversight. The Pentagon’s inspector general faulted the Air Force for buying $1.54 billion worth of maintenance and repair services on a sole-source, commercial basis, without first assessing if a commercial market existed for the services. It recommended that the Pentagon’s director of pricing block further Air Force contracts for F117 maintenance with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, until Pratt provided the information needed to evaluate whether the Air Force was getting a “fair and reasonable price” for the work. Tensions are growing between weapons makers and the Pentagon over the treatment of commercial items and services. When the U.S. military buys items considered commercial, it generally pays less but also receives less detailed cost or pricing information than in cases involving non-commercial items developed solely for the government. Pratt said it believed it had provided the Air Force sufficient data to declare “commerciality,” and that its investment in the F117 engine had saved the government significant operations and maintenance costs. Pratt & Whitney spokesman Matthew Bates said the company’s performance-based logistics system for servicing the F117 engine had tripled the time it could be used, eliminating 1,000 shop visits and saving $3 billion in costs. The F117 is a common derivative of the successful PW2000 engine, which powers the Boeing 757. Pratt funded its development and has sold this engine commercially to the Air Force since the early 1990s. The company and a large number of commercial airlines and repair facilities have been providing commercial overhaul and repair services for the engine for over 25 years. The watchdog report urged the Air Force to review how well its officials complied with rules for determining commerciality, and to consider corrective actions as appropriate. It also recommended: * The Air Force contracting officer be required to obtain necessary documents to support the commercial nature of the F117 sustainment contract, or deem the work non-commercial. * The Air Force prepare a written plan to develop a competitive market for F117 engine sustainment. * The Pentagon’s director of pricing establish policy for oversight of future Air Force contracts with Pratt and Whitney.

511,UTX,CORRECTED (OFFICIAL)-United Tech brings back ex-Pratt chief as aerospace executive,"(In 3rd paragraph, company corrects scope of Hess’ responsibilities) By Lewis Krauskopf Jan 20 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp said on Tuesday that the former head of its Pratt & Whitney jet engine division was returning in a new senior aerospace post, as the company’s new chief executive, Greg Hayes, shapes his management team. David Hess, who retired about a year ago after 34 years at United Technologies, will become senior vice president of aerospace business development, reporting to Hayes. In the newly created position, Hess will be responsible for helping to strengthen relationships with aerospace customers and partners. Hess comes back as Pratt & Whitney is ramping up production of a critical new engine that is revitalizing its commercial engine business. In a statement, Hayes praised Hess for “his strong customer relationships, deep industry knowledge and experienced leadership.” Hess’ appointment marked the latest change since Hayes took over abruptly in late November as CEO of the U.S. conglomerate, whose products include Sikorsky helicopters, Otis elevators and Carrier climate control equipment. Hayes, who previously was United Tech’s chief financial officer, replaced Louis Chenevert, in a move that stunned Wall Street. Hess is the second former United Tech executive to return to a high-profile post. The company last month named Akhil Johri as chief financial officer, returning from Pall Corp, where he had also been CFO. Before joining Pall in May 2013, Johri had served for 26 years at United Tech. Last week, the company said Alain Bellemare, who was president of UTC Propulsion & Aerospace Systems, would leave the company at the end of the month. The change eliminates  a management layer between Hayes and the heads of Pratt & Whitney and aircraft parts unit UTC Aerospace Systems.

513,UTX,UPDATE 2-United Tech cuts 2015 forecasts on currency worries,"(Adds CEO, CFO comments) By Lewis Krauskopf Jan 26 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp on Monday cut its full-year outlook because of the negative impact of a stronger dollar even as the U.S. conglomerate reported higher quarterly earnings on a rise in profit at its aerospace businesses. United Tech, which derives some 62 percent of sales from outside the United States, is hurt by the strengthening dollar once those sales are translated back into the U.S. currency. In an interview, Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes said that, to offset some of the currency impact, the company would cut costs and raise its planned share buyback for the year from $2 billion to $3 billion. “We need to be leaner at the corporate office, leaner at our overhead structures to help offset some of this currency risk,” Hayes told Reuters. Shares of the diversified manufacturer of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators fell 2.3 percent in after-hours trading. The company said it now expected 2015 earnings in a range of $6.85 to $7.05 per share, down from its prior range of $7.00 to $7.20, which it first gave in December. It forecast 2015 sales in a range of $65 billion to $66 billion. In December, it projected $66 billion to $67 billion in sales for this year. Analysts have been looking for earnings of $7.19 per share on sales of $67.02 billion. Executives said the changes did not reflect any difference in its fundamental outlook, and backed the company’s forecast for 3 percent to 5 percent in organic sales growth for the year. “Nothing has changed fundamentally about the way we view the world in terms of operations,” Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri said in an interview. United Technologies said fourth-quarter net income rose 0.7 percent to $1.47 billion from the same period a year ago. Earnings of $1.62 per share matched the average estimate of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 1.4 percent to $17 billion. Analysts were looking for $17.13 billion. Previously United Tech’s finance chief, Hayes replaced former CEO Louis Chenevert in November. The company said then that Chenevert had retired in a move that stunned Wall Street. Hayes has shaken up his management, particularly on the aerospace side. On Monday, he said those moves were “really just to streamline the overhead function.”   (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli, Diane Craft and James Dalgleish)",1262015,http://www.reuters.com/article/united-tech-results/update-2-united-tech-cuts-2015-forecasts-on-currency-worries-idUSL1N0V522Q20150126

515,UTX,United Tech may see $75 million cost benefit from lower commod prices - CFO,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp could see savings of as much as $75 million this year from lower prices for oil and other commodities, although it may have to cede some of those benefits  to customers, its finance chief said on Wednesday. Speaking at an investor conference, United Tech Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri said the benefit, which could equate to about 5 cents to 6 cents per share, was not included in the U.S. conglomerate’s outlook for 2015. United Tech last month forecast 2015 earnings in a range of $6.85 to $7.05 per share. “If you take the impact of oil and other commodities that we are seeing, we certainly feel there is probably a $50 to $75 million opportunity for 2015,” Johri said at the Cowen & Co Aerospace/Defense Conference in New York, which was broadcast over the Internet. Cheaper fuel could help the company save on gas for its more than 35,000 vehicles used to service Otis elevators, Carrier climate control systems and the company’s other building systems, or on fuel for testing its Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Johri said. The drop in copper prices also could help the company as well, Johri said. Copper is used in manufacturing Carrier’s climate control systems.  “It is good news from a cost point of view, clearly,” he said. However, Johri said, customers are also aware of these lower commodity prices. “What we drive out of our supply chain, they’re looking for us to pass a little bit of that to them,” the CFO said. “That tradeoff between how much can we keep to ourselves versus how much do we have to pass to the customers is what will ultimately determine what flows to the earnings.” Foreign currency fluctuations also remain a wild card, Johri said. The strengthening dollar has plagued recent earnings of multinational U.S. companies, whose overseas sales are reduced when they are translated back into the greenback. United Tech last month cut its 2015 earnings forecast, which it had first given only in December, primarily because of the dollar’s recent move. “If you look at risks and opportunities, I think clearly the thing which is most uncertain right now is, I would say, the foreign currency environment,” Johri said.

519,UTX,Sikorsky sees spike in helicopter demand from Eastern Europe,"WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, is seeing a big spike in demand for its UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from Eastern Europe, a top company executive said on Thursday. Several Eastern European countries have already submitted a formal request for the aircraft to the U.S. government, Samir Mehta, president of Sikorsky Defense Systems & Services, told reporters at the company’s Washington office. Mehta said demand for the popular workhorse utility helicopters was being driven by continued tensions with Russia and growing concerns in countries in the region about suppliers for their existing Russian-built helicopters. “In Eastern Europe, we’re seeing a renewed sense of urgency around acquiring Western equipment,” Mehta said. He said Slovakia was one country that had expressed interest, but did not name other potential buyers. Mehta said increasing calls to provide weapons to Ukraine could also result in new orders but said discussions were being held on a government-to-government basis. One option, he said, would be to rebuild older-model Black Hawks that are being taken out of inventory by the U.S. Army. Mehta said it would take about a year to upgrade such older Black Hawks for use by foreign countries. President Barack Obama will decide soon whether to provide Kiev with lethal weapons to fight pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday. {ID:nL6N0VF5FY] Sikorsky is looking to foreign sales and other opportunities to offset the end of U.S. orders for its Black Hawks. The Pentagon’s fiscal 2016 budget plan includes funding for the final year of a multiyear production contract. Last year, Sikorsky won contracts for several major new programs, including a combat rescue helicopter for the Air Force and a presidential helicopter for the Navy. But those projects are still in development and will not contribute as much to revenues as production of existing aircraft for some time. Mehta welcomed the U.S. government’s announcement Wednesday of a two-year project aimed at making it easier for NATO and member countries to share costs and buy weapons as a group as they struggle to stretch scarce defense budgets. He said the initiative could help smaller countries in Eastern Europe by aggregating their orders to drive down prices. It would also help lower the cost of maintaining aircraft by spreading the cost over a large number of planes, he said.

520,UTX,UPDATE 1-Pratt says growth in F-35 production will help cut costs,"(Adds detail from Pratt in paragraph four) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The Pentagon’s plans to fund 50 percent more F-35 fighter jets in fiscal 2016 will help drive down the price of the new plane and its engine, a top official at engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, said on Thursday. Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt’s military engines division, said the company had submitted a proposal for the ninth and tenth batches of engines to the F-35 program office, and he hoped to sign those agreements by the end of 2015. The previous two production agreements lowered the cost of the engine by nearly 8 percent, Croswell said, noting that further reductions were planned for the contracts now under discussion - 60 engines in the ninth batch and 100 in the tenth. Pratt said it has cut the cost of the F135 engine by 55 percent since its first delivery. The U.S. government signs separate production agreements with Lockheed Martin Corp, which builds the plane, and Pratt, which builds the engine. The Pentagon plans to spend nearly $400 billion to develop and build 2,457 of the radar-evading warplanes over the next two decades. Croswell welcomed the start of a long-delayed increase in production of the F-35 in the fiscal 2016 budget, which funds 57 jets after 38 a year earlier, and said it would help Pratt, Lockheed and other key suppliers drive down the plane’s cost. Pratt and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which makes the lift fan for the F-35 B-model, are finalizing plans for further reducing the engine’s cost, Croswell said. He gave no details. Lockheed and the other key suppliers for the airframe - Northrop Grumman Corp and BAE Systems Plc  -launched a similar effort last summer, which maps out specific investments to reduce the cost to build and repair the planes. Croswell said Pratt had also developed plans to upgrade the F135 engine in two separate phases. If the Pentagon accepts and funds the plans, the first upgrades would begin in 2017 or 2018 and reduce the fuel burn of the engine by 5 to 7 percent, Croswell said. The next upgrades would begin around 2022, cutting fuel burn by a further 15 to 20 percent. The upgrades draw on research work funded by the Air Force and the Navy in recent years. The Air Force included funding for more work on a next-generation engine in its 2016 budget plan.

Boley’s departure was effective immediately, said GenCorp spokesman Glenn Mahone. Seymour announced the news in a statement to employees on Friday, telling them he remained confident in the company’s ability to deliver results for customers, shareholders and employees. Sources familiar with the company said Boley and Seymour had had differences about the company’s future. “It was time for a change. There had been differences about the company’s direction,” said one source who was not authorized to speak publicly. Boley’s sudden departure from Aerojet Rocketdyne comes at an uncertain time in the rocket launch business and growing concern about the use of Russian-built rocket engines to power the rockets that lift U.S. satellites into space. In October, GenCorp said it took a $17.5 million loss due to issues with the AJ-26 rocket engine that it provides for the Antares launch vehicle built by Orbital Sciences Corp, which this week completed its merger with Alliant Techsystems Inc, forming a new company known as Orbital ATK. Orbital last year said it would swap out Aerojet’s AJ-26 engine, which is based on the aging Soviet-era NK-22 engine, a move that came even before an Antares rocket exploded seconds after liftoff destroying a cargo ship bound for the International Space Station. Last May, an AJ-26 engine exploded during a ground test at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. Aerojet Rocketdyne is also vying for a role in replacing the RD-180, a newer Russia-built engine that powers the Atlas 5 rocket used to lift U.S. military and spy satellites into space. The Air Force is weighing how to reduce U.S. reliance on the RD-180 engines given rising tensions with Russia over its actions in Ukraine.

531,UTX,AIRSHOW-Russia considers Superjet production in India,"BENGALURU, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Russia could assemble the Sukhoi Superjet regional jet in India to take advantage of lower production costs, the president of the plane’s maker United Aircraft Co (UAC) said on Thursday. UAC executives had visited several Indian aircraft assembly facilities in India and were impressed with their capabilities, Yury Slyusar, UAC’s new president, said at a press conference in the Aero India air show in Bengaluru. “We are looking at domestic production (in India) to help reduce the final price of the aircraft,” he said. This will also support Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” campaign, he added. He declined to say when an agreement might be reached. State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has the only complete aircraft production facility in India. Companies such as Tata Sons, Reliance Group and Mahindra & Mahindra have also been keen to move into the industry. Producing the Superjet, which can seat up to 100 passengers, in India would chime with the country’s nascent hopes of designing and producing a passenger aircraft. State-owned research agency National Aerospace Laboratories and HAL have, for the past few years, separately worked on a Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) programme to develop a plane that can carry around 100 passengers. UAC manufactures the Superjet as part of a joint venture with Italy’s Alenia Aermacchi, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica . Just over 50 aircraft have been delivered since 2011, with the joint venture having orders for around 300 planes. Brazil’s Embraer dominates the market for regional aircraft, which connect large airport hubs with smaller cities that have high demand for flights but low passenger numbers. Japan’s Mitsubishi Aircraft, which counts Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota among its investors, has developed the MRJ regional jet to compete with Embraer. Canada’s Bombardier also produces regional jets. Aviation consultancy Flightglobal Ascend has forecast a market for 4,071 regional jets worth $128.3 billion by 2033. UAC officials also confirmed they had begun work with China on the preliminary design of a proposed 250 to 280 seat widebody aircraft. Full-scale development is expected to begin in 2016, with the plane scheduled to enter into service around 2025. If successful, this will target the market dominated by the Airbus A330 and A350 and Boeing 787. China is also developing the Comac C919, a narrowbody jet that it hopes will break into the market dominated by the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.

533,UTX,"Below the radar, growth in Europe starts swelling company profits","* Over 70 pct of top firms seeing improvement in Europe * Renault, L’Oreal among the most bullish * QE, lower oil price seen adding to momentum * Analyst says investors yet to factor in Europe’s upturn By Tom Bergin and Blaise Robinson LONDON/PARIS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Signs of a long-awaited recovery in Europe are starting to show through in the profits of leading global companies, even if their bosses are still giving most of the credit to strong demand in Asia or the United States. Reuters has analysed comments from more than 50 of the biggest companies selling in Europe, which in recent weeks have mostly reported improving global earnings. In investor presentations and analyst calls, 71 percent said they enjoyed a swing from contraction to growth in Europe last year, or experienced a pickup in growth. Only 16 percent said European performance deteriorated in 2014 or that they expected declines in 2015. Thirteen percent said they saw stagnant markets for their goods and services in the region this year. “European markets recovered beyond our expectations,” Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault SA, told investors earlier this month, saying the continent was the main driver of the carmaker’s increased sales. Executives said they expected the positive momentum to be sustained through the year, as lower oil prices feed through into consumer’s pockets and the European Central Bank prints new money to buy government bonds. Analysts say investors haven’t fully factored in the extent to which the European Union - whose year-on-year GDP growth of just 1.3 percent in the last quarter of 2014 was around half the U.S. level — has begun to turn the corner. “It’s something that is still below the radar of global investors who have deserted Europe during the last few years and remain sceptical about the earnings trend in Europe,” said Benoit Peloille, equity strategist at French corporate and investment bank Natixis. “There is improvement in the macro landscape in Europe, and companies are starting to benefit from it,” he added. Northern European countries like Britain and Germany were typically cited as the strongest markets, but many companies said a recovery in southern Europe was tipping the continent into positive territory. L’Oreal Finance Director Christian Mulliez said that in Europe, the cosmetics group had seen “the strongest growth since 2007, thanks mainly to the turnaround in Southern Europe”. The company said Spain, Portugal and Greece had displayed good growth, while other firms also cited recovery in Italy. In their earnings reports for the fourth quarter of 2014, 58 percent of members of the STOXX 600 index of leading European companies said their profits had increased, although that data also reflects their operations outside Europe. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to grow by 19.5 percent, which would be Europe’s best earnings season in 3-1/2 years. European equities saw their largest ever inflows last week, totalling $5.8 billion. Stronger demand was the key driver of improved performance in Europe, executives said. This, and the tough cost-cutting introduced in recent years to tackle the soft economy, allowed many companies to boost margins, even against a deflationary backdrop. “List price increases are difficult to accomplish. But you saw in Europe a terrific margin expansion this year,” Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive Co., told investors last month, citing efficiency programmes the company had pursued. Europe’s weak GDP growth, sluggish inflation and the quantitative easing programme that the ECB has introduced to  address them have helped send the euro down to 11-year lows this year and some analysts predict it could hit parity with the dollar. That has weighed on the dollar value of European corporate profits and made products manufactured in the United States more expensive in euros. But on the ground in Europe, the impact is often positive. Steelmaker ArcelorMittal said the weaker euro was making it harder for peers outside Europe to compete here. Illinois-based construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar said it expected to face challenges selling diggers into Europe. But it also has a French manufacturing unit and “a euro at parity will just be a great tailwind for that”, CEO Doug Oberhelman said. European manufacturers Daimler, ABB and Alstom said they expected their exports to be boosted by the weaker euro. Their increased competitiveness could also prove lucrative for their overseas suppliers: Minnesota-based 3M , which has a large business selling to European industrial and healthcare companies, predicted gains. “As exports will increase as we go, I think that will help 3M as we go ahead,” CEO Inge Thulin told investors. Many companies reported weakness in their Russia and Ukraine markets that they didn’t expect to improve as long as hostilities in Ukraine continue and sanctions against Russia persist. The health of France’s economy was also a recurring worry. Yet only three companies expressed any concerns that Greece, which has been locked in tense negotiations with lenders about extending its bailout programme, could cause economic contagion across Europe. Some analysts say Greece, which was presenting economic reform plans on Monday to seal a euro zone financial lifeline, could yet be forced out of the single currency. Nonetheless, even among the companies which highlighted Greek risk, U.S. industrial group United Technologies Corporation said it thought any negative impact from Greece would be outweighed by the effects of QE and lower oil prices. Despite the overwhelming optimism around Europe, it was frequently guarded. And in a sign that the recovery is still far from robust, some companies said the growth they experienced was driven by the value end of the market. Among hotel groups, Hilton and Marriott said positive European performances were helped by expansion of limited-service brands like the former’s DoubleTree and the latter’s Courtyard and Residence Inn. Mark Hoplamazian, CEO of Hyatt Hotels Corporation, which offers almost exclusively full-service hotels in Europe, said “continental Europe continues to struggle”. Paul Polman, CEO of consumer goods group Unilever PLC , which experienced a contracting market in Europe as consumers opted for discounted and unbranded goods, said the European consumer had fundamentally changed. “After several years of austerity measures, a mindset of economizing and making-do has become ingrained,” he said.

Sikorsky said it was still working out details, but any deal with the Army would likely include more government-handed depot maintenance than the $2 billion deal that Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin Corp were awarded on Friday by the U.S. Navy for servicing its MH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters. “We’re very close at this point to getting something in place on the Black Hawk,” George Mitchell, vice president of aircraft and support for Sikorsky Aircraft’s Defense Systems and Services division, told reporters on a conference call. Mitchell said the talks with the Army were still in the early stages, but he was upbeat about prospects for a deal given the expected cost savings and increased reliability. He said the talks were under way between Sikorsky and the Army, but depending on the scope of a possible deal, it could be handled by the Sikorsky-Lockheed joint venture that is conducting the maintenance work for the Navy. Industry officials say an agreement for servicing the Black Hawks would be a boon for Sikorsky given the larger number of such helicopters operated by the Army. Rod Skotty, president of the Sikorsky-Lockheed venture, said the Navy deal announced on Friday was the third performance-based logistics contract signed for the Sea Hawks since 2004. He said it increased the number of helicopters to be serviced from 330 to 530, and included more than 1,700 parts, up from 1,266 under the previous contract.

United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes, speaking at investor day in New York where he detailed a potential split off of its Sikorsky helicopter unit, said that the acquisition climate was difficult due to high pricing. He reiterated his earlier stance that he was interested in large deals, but he cautioned that “mega deals” were “really, really hard” to execute. “We’re going to look for the bigger deals, and $5 billion is a pretty big deal,” Hayes told an audience of analysts and investors. Hayes said the company, which also sells jet engines, elevators and climate control systems, expects $45 billion in free cash flow between now and the end of the decade. Wall Street had been highly anticipating the meeting, which was Hayes’ first overview of the company since he became CEO in November. Hayes previously served as the company’s finance chief. The U.S. conglomerate on Wednesday announced it would review alternatives for Sikorsky, including a potential spinoff.

547,UTX,UTC to weigh splitting off of Sikorsky helicopter unit,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) will explore spinning off its Sikorsky helicopter unit, in the first major move by the company’s new chief executive officer to overhaul the U.S. conglomerate’s portfolio of businesses. The company’s board authorized the review, which also could include a sale of the maker of Black Hawk helicopters. Sikorsky had $7.5 billion in sales last year. The review is expected to finish before the end of the year. Sikorsky’s fit with United Tech, which had $65 billion in overall sales last year, has been long debated on Wall Street. The potential split is the first major strategic move under Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes, who was elevated in November after previously serving as finance chief. The company’s portfolio review found that “while Sikorsky is a great helicopter company, it probably didn’t fit into the UTC  portfolio,” Hayes told reporters. Hayes said the company was very comfortable with its other businesses, which include Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and Carrier climate control systems. Splitting apart its aerospace and commercial building segments would not create much value, he said. The new CEO is set to discuss the decision at United Tech’s highly anticipated investor day on Thursday in New York. Sikorsky did not match up with the rest of the company on several fronts, Hayes said. Its margins of 10 percent lagged the target of at least 15 percent for UTC’s businesses.  While UTC wants to capitalize on growth in commercial aerospace and urbanization in emerging markets, Sikorsky is primarily a military contractor, with the U.S. Department of Defense representing two-third of sales.   United Tech shares have climbed 7 percent since Hayes was named CEO, compared to a 1 percent decline for the S&P; 500 index .SPX. The Sikorsky move comes as many diverse manufacturers such as General Electric Co (GE.N) have taken hard looks at their businesses to determine best strategic fits. While the focus is on spinning off Sikorsky, Hayes said acquisition interest might come from companies in the United States or Europe.  A standalone Sikorsky could be an attractive takeover target for Boeing Co (BA.N) or Textron Inc (TXT.N), RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a recent research note. Hayes said the company had spoken to government officials in Washington who believe a standalone Sikorsky would be a viable supplier.

549,UTX,United Tech CEO: Sale of Sikorsky would be hard due to taxes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) chief executive officer said on Thursday that a sale of its Sikorsky helicopter unit would be “very hard” due to the heavy tax liability that would come with such a disposition. United Technologies said on Wednesday it is exploring alternatives for Sikorsky, including a potential spinoff. Any buyer is expected to face significant taxes, because the value of Sikorsky has appreciated so much since it became part of United Tech in 1929. “I think a sale would be very hard just because of the very low tax basis,” United Tech CEO Greg Hayes told reporters after the company held a presentation for Wall Street in New York. The CEO’s comments echoed the expectations of analysts, who have deemed a sale less likely. Hayes said in the past couple of months he “did talk to people about a potential acquisition. But I explained very clearly to them that it would be difficult to make any type of a sale work.” “As we had those discussions, it became clear that very few people would probably step up and do it,” he added. Previously the company’s finance chief, Hayes in November replaced prior CEO Louis Chenevert, who considered Sikorsky to be an “iconic asset,” Hayes said. While Hayes said he did not disagree with that, he said the fact that Sikorsky had slower growth prospects, lower margins and was primarily a military contractor means, as an independent company, “it will attract a type of investor different than those that are looking for higher-growth commercial businesses.” ",3132015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-united-tech-sikorsky-ceo/united-tech-ceo-sale-of-sikorsky-would-be-hard-due-to-taxes-idUSKBN0M82R820150313
550,UTX,U.S. arms buyer sees no cost impact from possible Sikorsky spin,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A spinoff of United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) Sikorsky Aircraft as a standalone company should not have any impact on the U.S. Defense Department’s costs, the Pentagon’s acquisition chief said Thursday. Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall said he was “neutral” about United Technologies’ announcement that it was considering a spinoff of the maker of Black Hawk helicopters. “At this point, based on what I know about the deal, I’m neutral about it. It should not impact us as far as cost or rates are concerned,” Kendall told reporters after an event hosted by Bloomberg Government. Analysts on Thursday said the potential for a big tax bill means Sikorsky will more likely be spun off into a standalone company than sold outright to potential buyers such as Boeing Co (BA.N), Textron Inc (TXT.N), Airbus (AIR.PA) or BAE Systems (BAES.L). Asked about his views on possible consolidation among top tier weapons makers, Kendall said the department was not encouraging such moves by industry despite a downturn in military spending. “At the top tier, we’re comfortable where we are. We want the market forces to work below that, and we’ll look at individual mergers on a case-by-case basis, or deals like the Sikorsky one,” he said. Kendall said he did not expect an upcoming decision by the Air Force about a new long-range strike bomber to trigger a major merger or acquisition, as some analysts have suggested. He said the decision would be made on the merits of the proposals, not the potential impact on the industrial base. Boeing Co (BA.N) and its partner Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) are competing with B-2 maker Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) for a contract valued at $50 billion to $80 billion to build 80 to 100 new bombers for the Air Force.

560,UTX,United Technologies wins reversal of $657 mln award over engine prices,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp on Monday won the reversal of a $657 million judgment imposed over decades-old claims accusing its Pratt & Whitney unit of overcharging the federal government on jet engines for the military. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati said the government did not prove damages from false statements allegedly made by Pratt when it competed in 1983 with GE Aircraft for a contract to supply engines for the F-15 and F-16 fighter jets. Writing for a three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton said the government had “every opportunity” to present expert testimony to show damages, but never took advantage. “The government had the burden of proving damages, and it never did,” Sutton wrote. Monday’s decision returned the case to U.S. District Judge Thomas Rose in Dayton, Ohio, who in June 2013 awarded damages for what the government said was six years of overcharges. The government now has another chance to provide damages. The U.S. Department of Justice had no immediate comment. United Technologies spokesman John Moran said the Hartford, Connecticut-based company is “very pleased” with the decision. “UTC has long maintained that the government suffered no actual damages as a result of the statements made in 1983,” he said. “We look forward to returning to the district court to finally put an end to this long-running case.” The government originally sued Pratt in 1999. Nine years later, Rose fined Pratt $7 million for violations of the federal False Claims Act, but found no actual damages because Pratt had given the government price concessions. The 6th Circuit upheld the fine but reversed the damages finding in 2010, leading to the subsequent award of damages and United Technologies’ latest appeal. In Monday’s decision, Sutton suggested that the case has gone on long enough. “We are tempted to say that, after seventeen years of litigation about a fraud that occurred thirty-two years ago, the time has come to end this dispute,” he wrote. According to court papers, the government sued in Dayton because some of Pratt’s alleged improper activity occurred at the nearby Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon’s upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T;’s proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s new CEO, is charged with reviving the company’s falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M’s first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy. Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google’s future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again. Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street’s expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world’s largest social network’s business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company’s next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company’s outlook for the remainder of 2015. On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices. On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares. General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before. On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer’s flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that “challenges” with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business. Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes. Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods. Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry’s top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working. On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum’s China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from “brand fatigue” in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn’t losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown. Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer’s drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider’s growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy. AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company’s dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira’s continuing growth and sales of the company’s recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc’s potent treatments for the liver disease. Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands. Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories’ infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company’s branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar. Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company’s plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015. On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company’s cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company’s buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls’ business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group. Pentagon’s No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year. Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter. On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald’s and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company’s previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States. On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company’s connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June. On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC. Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware’s revenue comes from outside the United States. Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate a negative impact of 3-4 percent from foreign currency on license revenue growth. Programmable chip maker Xilinx Inc will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday. The company, which dominates the programmable chip market along with Altera Corp, is expected to report profit and revenue that are largely in line with analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will look for updates on sales to the broadcast, consumer and automotive end market and sales to communications and data center customers. PulteGroup Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be released on Thursday. Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton’s second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup’s results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market. Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor’s pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be “challenging,” having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year. Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J; Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations. Investors will be looking for updates on any job cuts and the company’s plans to idle rigs in an oversupplied market. On Tuesday, coal miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a ninth straight quarterly loss and on Thursday, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp is expected to report a wider first-quarter loss due to continued weakness in coal prices. Kimberly-Clark Corp, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, is expected to report better-than-expected first-quarter sales, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, helped by growing demand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and South Africa. However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday. Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars. To tackle growing competition, the company has been pouring money in advertisements and promotions, but this is expected to hurt its full-year earnings per share by 2 percentage points. It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks. When the company will report its first-quarter profit on Thursday, investors will be looking out for comments on whether the company will make more acquisitions in the meat and bakery snacks category, which are becoming more popular than candy, and the effect of the strong dollar on its outlook. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc will report its first-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will be looking at how much Boston’s record snowfall hurt results at Dunkin Brands, whose Dunkin’ Donuts shops are concentrated in the U.S. northeast. Experts say the impact could be meaningful. Under Armour Inc, a sports apparel and footwear maker, is expected to report profit and sales for the first quarter in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect Under Armour to continue its 19-quarter streak of reporting more than 20 percent growth in revenue, helped by expanded offerings in sport and outdoor clothing, strong demand for its Speedform Apollo running shoes, new launches in basketball footwear and sponsorship deals. The company is also expected to benefit from investments in its fast-growing digital platform and from the acquisitions of fitness tracking apps Endomondo and MyFitnessPal. When the company will report on Tuesday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and color on the performance of new launches in footwear. Hanesbrands Inc, the innerwear and apparel maker is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts are projecting first-quarter sales growth of more than 15 percent as the company benefits from higher sales of sport and gym clothing at department stores, and the acquisition of DBApparel and Maidenform Brands. When the company reports on Thursday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and more color on the company’s recent acquisition of college logo clothing maker Knights Apparel. Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King refrigeration units, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by growth in global industrial and construction markets. Investors will be looking for the impact of a strong dollar on the company’s industrial business, which has a higher proportion of revenue coming from outside the United States. Investors will also be looking for an update on how much the weakness in oil prices has hurt the company’s newly acquired centrifugal compression business. Xerox Corp, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, is expected to report first-quarter revenue that is slightly below analysts’ estimate on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Xerox had cut its profit forecast for 2015 for the second time after reporting its sixth-consecutive drop in revenue last quarter. In December, the company agreed to sell its IT outsourcing arm to Atos. Teck Resources Ltd, Canada’s largest diversified miner, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as prices for both copper and steel-making coal remain depressed amid a fall in demand. The company in March denied media reports that it was in talks to merge with Chilean copper producer Antofagasta. Teck CEO also refuted speculations of a possible merger with HudBay Minerals or an acquisition of Zaldivar, a copper mine owned by Barrick Gold. Teck said in February it might reduce its dividend in July if the industry-wide production cuts fail to boost coal prices. Investors will be interested in any comments of a possible merger or acquisition and demand for steel-making coal. Car seat maker Lear Corp is expected to report higher first-quarter profit on Friday helped by strong demand in North America and a rise in vehicle production. Some analysts expect Lear to benefit from cheaper commodity prices and report higher margins. Investors will look for Lear’s comments on Mercato Capital seeking a split of the auto parts suppliers businesses. Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Lazard is expected to benefit from a jump in corporate dealmaking, which should have boosted its M&A; advisory business. Globally, deals worth $811.8 billion were announced in the first quarter, up 21 percent, compared to a year earlier. Among them, Lazard advised on the merger of Heinz-Kraft and the sale of Serbia’s state-operated Telekom Srbija. However, analysts expect lower-than-anticipated deal completions to weigh on the company’s quarterly revenue. Lazard has been focusing more on asset management to be less reliant on financial advisory fees. AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. car dealer chain, reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. Investors will be watching margins on new car sales, any potential expansion moves and for any concerns about U.S. consumer spending going forward. On Thursday, Qlik Technologies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on higher demand for its data analytics software. The company had forecast full-year adjusted profit below analysts’ average estimate and its revenue forecast was also largely below Wall Street estimates. Touchscreen chipmaker Synaptics Inc is expected to report third-quarter profit below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on weak demand from smartphone makers. Analysts have said that certain Samsung designs that have come out recently are not using Synaptics touch IC products. Online music streaming service provider Pandora Media Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ average estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company is expected to benefit from stronger listening hours and its gradual move into automobiles, where more than half of all radio listening occurs in the U.S. Investors will look for updates on user and local ad growth. On Wednesday, specialty mattress maker Select Comfort Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, halting a run of four straight quarters where sales beat expectations. Investors will be looking out for the company’s Sleep Number mattress sales as well as for any changes in full-year outlook. The company provided 2015 profit forecast below estimates in February. On Friday, Apigee Corp, which develops software to manage web applications, is expected to raise up to $92 million in its IPO, valuing the company at about $523.8 million at the higher end of its IPO price range. The company’s software platform allows businesses to design and deploy application programming interfaces (API) to link its core IT systems with data used by customers, others. The company primarily offers application interface management and predictive analysis services. On Tuesday, Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver will present the annual federal budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1, the last budget before the general election scheduled for October. He has promised a balanced budget and has pledged to introduce balanced budget legislation as well. The Conservative government has already introduced a package of tax cuts and family benefits, and infrastructure spending, that has soaked up much of the anticipated surplus. A decline in oil prices has cut much of the remaining room for maneuver. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has ruled out major stimulus spending, arguing that despite cheap oil the economy was still growing. On Thursday Mexico’s national statistics office will release economic activity data for February, after the gauge expanded in January on a pickup in services and agriculture while industry sank. Also on Thursday, Mexico will release annual inflation data for the first half of April, after the indicator picked up to 3.14 in March, reaching just above the central bank’s 3 percent target. Retail sales data released on Friday will reveal how the gauge fared in February, after it rose at its fastest pace in over a year in January. Monday, April 20 International Business Machines Corp is expected to report lower revenue for the 12th straight quarter, as it exits unprofitable businesses and attempts to move into cloud-focused areas, away from its traditional hardware and consulting services foundation. Net profit for the first quarter is expected to rise slightly. Morgan Stanley is expected to report a rise in first-quarter earnings. The company’s institutional securities business now depends more on equities trading business, rather than fixed income trading. Rival Goldman Sachs’s strong performance in stock trading in the first quarter puts the spotlight on Morgan Stanley. The bank has also been focusing more on its wealth management business. It is trying to squeeze more revenue out of its major businesses by getting wealth clients to use investment banking and trading services. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, who helped execute a sweeping cost-cutting strategy across several business lines at the bank, will step down to join Google as its finance chief next month. Halliburton Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by soft drilling activity. Oil producers have significantly scaled back spending amid weak oil prices. However, cost cuts and continued strength in the Middle East and Asia are expected to help the oilfield services provider minimize the effects of the oil downturn. The company has said it would cut more than 6,000 jobs and investors will seek details about any further cost cuts, especially after Schlumberger cut 11,000 more jobs. Halliburton is looking to complete its $35 billion-acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes, which is expected to report its own first-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors will want to know about more potential asset sales after Halliburton said earlier it would sell three businesses to pave the way for regulatory clearance for the deal. Investors will also look to see if the deal will help it better cope with pricing pressure from oil producers. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the world’s second-largest cruise operator by revenue, is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales below analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had forecast revenue below expectations, citing a strong dollar and weak pricing in the Caribbean. Investors will be looking out for any changes in full-year forecast and comments on the Caribbean market, as well as updates on expansion in Europe and Asia. Toymaker Hasbro Inc will report first-quarter results before the bell. The sequels of “Jurassic Park” and “The Avengers” in first half of 2015 and the new “Star Wars” movie in December are expected to boost Hasbro’s sales this year and keep it growing at a faster pace than larger rival Mattel Inc’s. Canadian National Railway reports its financial results for the first quarter. On average, analysts are expecting earnings to rise to 85 Canadian cents a share from 66 Canadian cents a year earlier, as revenue increases to C$3.04 billion. The company may discuss its safety record and the costs associated with its recent string of derailments as cleanup continues near the town of Gogama, in northern Ontario.  Rogers Communications Inc, Canada’s largest wireless phone provider and a major cable and media company, reports results for the first quarter. The company has lost ground in wireless and other subscriber metrics in recent quarters but has been able on average to charge its customers more, a trend investors will be eager to appraise.

566,UTX,Sikorsky sputters as United Tech nears decision on spinoff,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp is nearing a decision on whether to spin off its Sikorsky helicopter unit as the business is struggling with its financial performance. United Tech Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes said on Tuesday he expects the company to finish its review of strategic options for Sikorsky by midyear. The review was announced in March. Sikorsky’s first-quarter operating profit dropped 11 percent on a 7 percent fall in sales, according to results released on Tuesday. Commercial sales tumbled 26 percent. The prime culprit? The decline in oil prices. A huge chunk of Sikorsky’s nonmilitary business is for oil industry customers shuttling workers and equipment to offshore rigs. Moves by oil companies to cut back on expenses are affecting the helicopter industry. “We are seeing pressure from the oil and gas segment,” Paul Lundstrom, United Tech’s vice president of investor relations, told analysts on a conference call.  Lundstrom called the quarter a “slow start” for Sikorsky, but added it was too early in the year for the company to cut financial forecasts. Sterne Agee analyst Peter Arment said such pressure was unlikely to abate any time soon. “If you were a betting man, you’d think it would persist all year, because it’s tied to a lot of offshore activity which we know is going to be down,” Arment said. Both the company and analysts have deemed a spinoff of Sikorsky more likely because of the huge tax bill United Tech would face in a sale.  While Tuesday’s results could further reduce chances of a sale, Sikorsky’s value as a standalone entity has probably not changed, said Russell Solomon, an analyst at Moody’s. Analysts in March said Sikorsky was worth $7 billion to $10 billion. “There was a recognition that the market conditions are not exactly strong right now,” Solomon said. Hayes previously said Sikorsky did not match up on several fronts with other UTC segments, including Otis elevators or Pratt & Whitney jet engines. Sikorsky has lower profit margins and is mainly a military contractor. Other helicopter companies are also embedded in larger entities, including Finmeccanica’s AgustaWestland and Textron Inc’s Bell units, which may protect them from industry volatility, such as shifting military budgets.  “There might be more risk to a standalone entity without the other businesses to cushion the cyclicality,” Solomon said.

568,UTX,"Strong dollar weighs on United Tech sales, but profit rises","(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) posted a higher-than-expected  quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by gains in its unit selling climate control and security systems for buildings, even as a stronger dollar weighed on sales. The U.S. conglomerate’s sales slipped 1.4 percent to $14.54 billion, shy of Wall Street’s target of $14.88 billion. Foreign currency swings hurt sales by 4 percentage points, with sales otherwise growing 3 percent on an organic basis. Sales fell 7 percent at the company’s Otis elevators business, which generates major business internationally. United Tech follows manufacturers such as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) in reporting that its sales were hurt by a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of foreign sales upon conversion into the greenback. “It’s the same theme that is playing out when you look at other industrials,” UTC Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri said in an interview. “Most have missed on the top line, but the bottom line is okay because the analysts calibrated (earnings) impact of currency reasonably well.” United Tech expects the dollar to hurt sales by about $2.5 billion this year, although it backed its 2015 forecast. The company in January had cut its 2015 outlook due to currency concerns. United Tech shares rose 1.3 percent to $118 in pre-market trading. United Tech, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, said first-quarter net income rose 18 percent to $1.43 billion, or $1.58 per share.  Excluding items, it reported earnings of $1.51 per share. Analysts on average were looking for $1.45 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Profit at UTC’s climate, controls and security unit jumped 36 percent to $729 million, helped in part by a $126 million gain tied to an acquisition.

569,UTX,"UPDATE 2-Strong dollar weighs on United Tech sales, but profit rises","(Adds CEO, CFO comments, pre-market share price) By Lewis Krauskopf April 21 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp posted a higher-than-expected  quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by gains in its unit selling climate control and security systems for buildings, even as a stronger dollar weighed on sales. The U.S. conglomerate’s sales slipped 1.4 percent to $14.54 billion, shy of Wall Street’s target of $14.88 billion. Foreign currency swings hurt sales by 4 percentage points, with sales otherwise growing 3 percent on an organic basis. Sales fell 7 percent at the company’s Otis elevators business, which generates major business internationally. United Tech follows manufacturers such as General Electric Co and Honeywell International Inc in reporting that its sales were hurt by a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of foreign sales upon conversion into the greenback. “It’s the same theme that is playing out when you look at other industrials,” UTC Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri said in an interview. “Most have missed on the top line, but the bottom line is okay because the analysts calibrated (earnings) impact of currency reasonably well.” United Tech expects the dollar to hurt sales by about $2.5 billion this year, although it backed its 2015 forecast. The company in January had cut its 2015 outlook due to currency concerns. United Tech shares rose 1.3 percent to $118 in pre-market trading. United Tech, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, said first-quarter net income rose 18 percent to $1.43 billion, or $1.58 per share. Excluding items, it reported earnings of $1.51 per share. Analysts on average were looking for $1.45 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Profit at UTC’s climate, controls and security unit jumped 36 percent to $729 million, helped in part by a $126 million gain tied to an acquisition.

570,UTX,US STOCKS-Wall St set to rise as results beat low expectations,"* Dow components Verizon, DuPont and United Tech beat estimates * Yahoo, Chipotle, Yum to report after markets close * Teva offers to buy Mylan * Futures up: Dow 61 pts, S&P; 8.25 pts, Nasdaq 21.75 pts   (Adds details, comment, updates prices) By Tanya Agrawal April 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stock were set to rise at the open on Tuesday as a spate of companies beat lowered expectations, helping to ease fears of a disappointing earnings quarter. Nearly 75 percent of the S&P; 500 components that have reported earnings so far have beat analyst expectations, topping the 70 percent average in the last four quarters. However, just 45.8 percent have beat on revenue, compared with the 58 percent average top line beat over the last year. Dow components Verizon, DuPont and United Technologies beat expectations even as the strong dollar weighed on the results of DuPont and UTX. Verizon shares were up 0.2 percent at $49.47, DuPont rose 0.33 percent to $73.08 and United Technologies added 1.62 percent to $118.40. The dollar is up almost 9 percent since the beginning of the year against a basket of major currencies. A strong dollar hurts companies with large overseas operations. “Market is in momentum mode and is taking the path of least resistance. It’s still early in the week and things could change with some major tech stock reporting later in the week but there has been the absence of a real negative factor,” said Brian Fenske, head of sales trading at ITG in New York. IBM shares were down 0.37 percent at $165.55 in premarket trading after its earnings exceeded low expectations on Monday as it shed unprofitable businesses to focus on cloud-computing. Mylan was up 8.8 percent at $74 after Israeli drugmaker Teva made an unsolicited offer for the company for $82 per share, in what could be the drug industry’s largest takeover attempt this year. Teva was up 2.6 percent at $64.92. Earnings expected later on Tuesday include Chipotle, Yahoo and Yum Brands. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital has taken a new stake in General Motors Co, nearly a year after selling off it position in the automaker, the firm said in a letter to clients on Monday.

572,UTX,United Express flight with engine fire forced to land in Philadelphia,"(Reuters) - A plane with an engine on fire was forced to make an emergency landing on Tuesday at Philadelphia International Airport, where it landed safely, according to the airport and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The fire broke out in the No. 2 engine of United Airlines Express Flight No. 4882, bound for Newark, New Jersey, with 75 people on board, Philadelphia International Airport said on its Twitter feed. “The cockpit received an overheat indication, prompting the shutdown of one engine,” regional contractor Republic Airlines, which operated the flight on behalf of United Express, said in a news release. “All aboard deplaned on the runway... and alternate transportation arrangements are being made for the passengers.” The Bombardier Inc Q400 plane departed from Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, after 2:30 p.m. EDT.     The plane was sprayed with foam when it landed shortly after 4 p.m. EDT, said Mary Flannery, an airport spokeswoman. “We needed the foam because we got the alert from the pilots that the flight was being diverted since the engine was on fire,” she said. The passengers were evacuated safely in Philadelphia, the airport said. Officials said one passenger with a history of heart problems was taken to a hospital. The plane was powered by engines made by Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp. “Pratt & Whitney Canada is working with authorities, the operator and the aircraft manufacturer in order to assess the situation,” spokesman Marc Duchesne said in a statement. Bombardier spokeswoman Marianella Delabarrera described the Q400 as a “robust and reliable aircraft” and said the cause of the incident would be investigated. Some flights were delayed and airport activity was temporarily halted, but the airport said it was back in full operation by about 5 p.m. EDT. “Maintenance is reviewing the issue, as the safety of our customers and crew is always our No. 1 priority,” Republic said.

574,UTX,United Airlines to lease up to 25 used aircraft from AerCap Holdings,"(Reuters) - United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) on Wednesday announced plans to lease up to 25 used aircraft from AerCap Holdings NV, one of the world’s largest aircraft lessors (AER.N), to reduce its dependence on smaller, 50-seat jets. The Chicago-based airline said it expects delivery of 11 used Airbus Group NV (AIR.PA) A319 aircraft over the next two years, with the right to add up to 14 more of the single-isle planes over the next five years, subject to certain conditions. The additions are part of a broader fleet reorganization United unveiled last month that aims to match bigger planes with markets of growing demand, without increasing its spending or capacity forecasts.  Integral to the plan is removing 50-seat jets flown by United’s regional contractors, which can waste more fuel per passenger than larger planes. The carrier said it will take 130 of these aircraft off its schedule by the end of 2015, with more cuts to come later. As an example, United said it now might fly two A319s, which have more than 120 seats, on a route that currently operates with three 70-seat jets. It then could use those 70-seaters on routes in which it currently uses the 50-seat planes. “Our flexible fleet plan allows us to opportunistically add used aircraft when the economics are attractive,” United’s Fleet Vice President Ron Baur said in a statement. Cheap fuel prices, down more than 40 percent since June, have made it increasingly affordable to fly old, less fuel-efficient jets. China Southern Airlines Co Ltd (600029.SS) currently operates the A319s that United will lease, with first deliveries starting in early 2016. United said it will add new seats, overhead-bin extensions and Wi-Fi to the planes, and it will perform checks so they align with its maintenance program. United said last month that the lease of 10 to 20 used narrowbody aircraft would not alter its forecast for yearly capital expenditures of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion over the next three to four years.

575,UTX,UTC in talks with potential buyers for its Sikorsky business: sources,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is in talks with potential buyers for its Sikorsky Aircraft business, according to four people familiar with the situation.  Airbus Group (AIR.PA), Boeing (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) are exploring their options for a deal, but a steep $3 billion tax bill associated with an outright sale of Sikorsky continues to dampen the interest of big companies, the sources  said. Even with a deferred tax bill, it could take seven to eight years to get some of those funds back, which would be difficult for shareholders and board members to accept, the sources added.  A bid date could be announced later this month, one of the sources said. “As previously announced, UTC is exploring strategic alternatives for Sikorsky, which could include a sale or spin-off. We continue to expect the evaluation will be completed by midyear,” United Technologies spokesman John Moran said in an emailed statement. Analysts said in March Sikorsky was worth $7 billion to $10 billion. According to the sources, the likely cost of the deal, seen around $10 billion, was another big barrier, especially given the current stagnant state of the commercial helicopter market and the fact that larger defense contracts were probably not up for grabs for years. “While we have no comment on UTC’s business decisions and strategy with regard to their Sikorsky unit, we are certainly keeping an eye on developments with Sikorsky,” Airbus spokesman Clay McConnell said in an email. Sikorsky’s business prospects were seen as flat at best, the sources said.   A minority stake was possible and could help buyers avert the big tax bill, but might not appeal to the larger weapons makers, given the lack of control it would imply, said one of the sources.  “The boards and shareholders would be concerned about that,” the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, added.

577,UTX,"Sikorsky Aircraft cutting jobs, consolidating facilities","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, on Tuesday said it would cut 1,400 jobs and consolidate facilities, with lower oil prices sharply reducing demand for helicopters in the oil and gas sectors, and international military orders down. Sikorsky spokesman Paul Jackson confirmed the job cuts, in which workers and the company’s union were notified earlier Tuesday, but said the move was not related to the parent company’s ongoing review of strategic options for Sikorsky. “Today’s announcement is based on the current challenging market conditions and is independent of United Technologies’ ongoing review of strategic options for Sikorsky,” said spokesman Paul Jackson. “The two are completely unrelated.” Reuters reported last month that Airbus Group, Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp were exploring options for a deal, although a steep $3 billion tax bill associated with an outright sale was dampening interest. Potential bids were due on Monday. United Technologies also shook up Sikorsky’s management in April, naming Robert Leduc to succeed Mick Maurer as the company’s president.  “Sustained decreases in oil prices continue to drive significant declines in capital investments by oil companies in offshore oil exploration projects impacting Sikorsky and resulting in reduced production levels,” Jackson said.  He said demand for certain international military products had also dropped. United Technologies in April cited pressure in the oil and gas sector as it reported an 11 percent drop in Sikorsky’s first-quarter operating profit and a 7 percent decline in sales. A huge chunk of Sikorsky’s nonmilitary business is for oil industry customers shuttling workers and equipment to offshore rigs. Efforts by energy companies to reduce expenses due to the drop in oil prices are rippling through the helicopter industry. The company told workers and the Teamsters union that the  job cuts would affect Sikorsky’s facilities in Poland, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, and would take place over the next twelve months starting immediately. The layoffs will affect 342 Sikorsky employees and 560 contractors in the United States, as well as 510 workers in Poland. The company has a total workforce of around 15,300.

583,UTX,Airbus watching whether UTC will sell Sikorsky helicopter unit,"HERZLIYA, Israel (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) is “watching with interest” to see whether United Technologies Corp (UTC) (UTX.N) puts its Sikorsky helicopter business up for sale, the head of Airbus’ U.S. division said on Monday. UTC expects to make a decision on whether the conglomerate will divest Sikorsky in a couple of months. “We are watching that with interest. We are interested to see what United Technologies intends to do with Sikorsky,” Allan McArtor, chief executive of Airbus Group, Inc, told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual Herzliya Conference in Israel. He declined to elaborate. McArtor said Airbus was interested in acquisition opportunities, particularly anything in the areas of defense, space, helicopters, cyber security and 3D manufacturing. He noted that Airbus was opening a new facility in Silicon Valley devoted to start-ups and has just launched a $100-$150 million venture capital fund to provide seed financing to high tech start-ups. Airbus Group, Inc, supplies helicopters in the United States to buyers such as the Coast Guard, U.S. Army and U.S. Navy.  While Airbus is not very active in Israel, McArtor said the country’s high tech sector was “fertile ground for collaboration” and provides great opportunity. Israel’s dedication to developing its defense capabilities has been expanded to cyber space in recent years, spawning an industry that has attracted a near fourfold increase in venture capital investment since 2010. “Protection of networks is something we are all interested in,” McArtor said. Growth at Europe’s Airbus, as well as at rival Boeing (BA.N), was being driven by emerging markets in the Middle East, India, China, southeast Asia and Latin America, as well as by global low cost airlines, he said. Much of the purchases are for single-aisle short-haul aircraft. The U.S. market is mature but with a wave of consolidation nearly over, airlines are turning their attention to modernizing their fleets and reducing carbon emissions. “With the cost of money being near zero and the price of fuel going down, they are in a more healthy position to buy more new airplanes,” said McArtor, adding that passengers are demanding more modern fleets. He said growth in U.S. aircraft orders was about 4-4.5 percent a year and he expected orders of planes in the Americas to be some 4,600 over the next two decades.

584,UTX,Airbus watching whether UTC will sell Sikorsky helicopter unit,"HERZLIYA, Israel, June 8 (Reuters) - Airbus is “watching with interest” to see whether United Technologies Corp (UTC) puts its Sikorsky helicopter business up for sale, the head of Airbus’ U.S. division said on Monday. UTC expects to make a decision on whether the conglomerate will divest Sikorsky in a couple of months. “We are watching that with interest. We are interested to see what United Technologies intends to do with Sikorsky,” Allan McArtor, chief executive of Airbus Group, Inc, told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual Herzliya Conference in Israel. He declined to elaborate. McArtor said Airbus was interested in acquisition opportunities, particularly anything in the areas of defence, space, helicopters, cyber security and 3D manufacturing. He noted that Airbus was opening a new facility in Silicon Valley devoted to start-ups and has just launched a $100-$150 million venture capital fund to provide seed financing to high tech start-ups. Airbus Group, Inc, supplies helicopters in the United States to buyers such as the Coast Guard, U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. While Airbus is not very active in Israel, McArtor said the country’s high tech sector was “fertile ground for collaboration” and provides great opportunity. Israel’s dedication to developing its defence capabilities has been expanded to cyber space in recent years, spawning an industry that has attracted a near fourfold increase in venture capital investment since 2010. “Protection of networks is something we are all interested in,” McArtor said. Growth at Europe’s Airbus, as well as at rival Boeing , was being driven by emerging markets in the Middle East, India, China, southeast Asia and Latin America, as well as by global low cost airlines, he said. Much of the purchases are for single-aisle short-haul aircraft. The U.S. market is mature but with a wave of consolidation nearly over, airlines are turning their attention to modernising their fleets and reducing carbon emissions. “With the cost of money being near zero and the price of fuel going down, they are in a more healthy position to buy more new airplanes,” said McArtor, adding that passengers are demanding more modern fleets. He said growth in U.S. aircraft orders was about 4-4.5 percent a year and he expected orders of planes in the Americas to be some 4,600 over the next two decades. The Middle East is Airbus’ largest market but Israel’s flag carrier El Al has an all-Boeing fleet. Airbus supplies planes to smaller Israeli carriers Arkia and Israir. McArtor said El Al would have to modernise its fleet as its market share has eroded due to competition from low-cost carriers.

585,UTX,UTC to review Sikorsky options following offers,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) board of directors is scheduled to meet later this week to review options for its $8 billion Sikorsky aircraft business after receiving offers for it, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. UTC is considering two potential tax-efficient transactions for Sikorsky: either a spin-off or a combination with peer Textron Inc (TXT.N), which submitted an offer for Sikorsky earlier this month, the people said. The merger between Textron and Sikorsky could be structured as a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT), a transaction that allows a parent company to sell its subsidiary while avoiding a hefty tax bill. Alternatively, UTC may decide to sell Sikorsky outright to another company. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N) are among those that have expressed interest in a potential deal, according to the sources. UTC is carrying out extensive due diligence on the offers it received for Sikorsky and is unlikely to have made a decision by the time it meets with analysts at the Paris Air Show next week, some of the sources said.  UTC is contemplating a tax-free spin-off of Sikorsky or an RMT with Textron because any takeover offers by suitors would need to surmount a steep $3 billion tax bill associated with an outright sale of Sikorsky. A tax-free spin-off of Sikorsky remains the most likely outcome given UTC’s limited appetite to become an investor in Textron and the success that other defense companies, such as Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and ITT Corp (ITT.N), have had with spinning off non-core units, one of the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. UTC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Textron declined to comment.

It may have to sell some assets to make an RMT with Sikorsky work.  Sikorsky last week said it would cut 1,400 jobs over the next 12 months and consolidate facilities due to a drop in production volumes and lower investment in offshore oil projects.

587,UTX,"Aerojet CEO vows to cut overhead, eyes 10 percent cut in workforce","PARIS (Reuters) - Eileen Drake, the new chief executive of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc (AJRD.N), on Sunday vowed to keep a “huge focus” on cutting overhead costs in coming years, including a 10-percent workforce reduction and possible facility closings. Drake, a former Army helicopter pilot and executive with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), joined Aerojet Rocketdyne in March as its chief operating officer, just three days before the company announced a major cost-reduction drive and changed its name from GenCorp Inc. She took over as CEO on June 1, when Scott Seymour retired for health reasons. Seymour had taken over the helm of the Aerojet Rocketdyne unit in February when its president, Warren Boley, was pushed out amid differences over corporate plans.  On Sunday, in her first interview since becoming CEO, Drake sought to downplay any concerns about changes and highlighted the company’s strong foundation, solid backlog and committed workforce. But she said it needed to squeeze more synergies out of the 2013 acquisition of Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne. “We have to be sure that we really work as one company,” Drake said, citing what she called opportunities to eliminate redundant organizations across the company. Drake said she would continue a program kicked off in March to make the company’s products more affordable. Initially, it calls for a 1 million square foot (93,000 sq meter) reduction in facilities in Sacramento, where the company is headquartered, and a 10-percent cut in the 5,000-person workforce over the next four years. Before coming to the Paris Airshow, Drake has been visiting Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 14 facilities in 11 states. She vowed to evaluate carefully how each of those sites was being used, and whether further facility consolidations were possible. Aerojet Rocketdyne is also keeping close tabs on an investigation into the Oct. 28 explosion of an Aerojet-powered  Orbital ATK (OA.N) rocket, a report that has been delayed for months. Orbital and Aerojet Rocketdyne, which refurbished a Soviet-era engine to power Orbital’s Antares rocket, are at odds over the root cause of the explosion. Orbital rejects Aerojet’s claim that the mishap was caused by debris in the rocket’s fuel tank. A report prepared by Orbital under the oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration is expected in coming weeks. The company plans to bid for U.S. Air Force funds to continue its work on a new U.S. rocket engine called AR-1. The company said it remained in dialogue with United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) about using that new engine to replace the Russian-built RD-180 engine that now powers ULA’s Atlas 5 rocket. The U.S. Congress passed a law last year that bans use of the Russian engines for military and spy satellite launches after 2019. Aerojet Rocketdyne has joined with several other players to ask the Pentagon to investigate obtaining the data rights to the rocket, but ULA has said it does not plan to sell the rights.

589,UTX,UPDATE 3-United Tech to exit Sikorsky helicopter business,"(Updates with comments from Sikorsky president, share price) By Andrea Shalal PARIS, June 15 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp  said on Monday it was exiting the helicopter business and would decide by the end of the third quarter whether to spin off or sell its $8 billion Sikorsky Aircraft unit, the U.S. military’s largest helicopter maker. United Technologies said the decision to shed the 90-plus year-old Sikorsky unit, which generates lower margins than other United Tech units, came after a review of strategic alternatives announced earlier this year and was subject to final board approval. United Tech shares were trading 2.5 percent lower at $114.60 around mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. United Tech Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said Sikorsky was well positioned for long-term growth and separating it from the portfolio would allow both Sikorsky and the parent company to better focus on their core businesses. “Whether we sell it or whether we spin it, the future will be bright for Sikorsky,” Hayes said. The board met last week to discuss its options after receiving a number of offers for Sikorsky, including one that would combine the company with the Bell Helicopter unit of Textron Inc, Reuters reported last week. Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co have also expressed interest in a potential deal. Bob Leduc, president of Sikorsky Aircraft, told Reuters in his first media interview that he remained confident about the company’s longer-term outlook, despite a sharp downturn in the commercial market and the pending sell or spin decision. Leduc, a long-time United Tech executive, said he could not refuse Hayes’ request that he return from retirement to head Sikorsky. “From my perspective, Sikorsky is a national treasure. That opportunity doesn’t come along very often,” he said. Any successful bidder would likely have to pay a premium given the steep tax bill facing the parent company, Leduc said. He said the current downturn in the commercial market was expected to last 18 to 24 months, with dropping oil prices driving demand from the oil and gas sector sharply lower. Earlier, Leduc told an investor conference the company expected to boost revenues to at least $10 billion by 2025 based on its backlog of $49 billion, largely in U.S. military orders, which account for about 70 percent of the company’s business. Leduc said there was “upside” on top of that revenue forecast, depending on developments in new helicopter programs. “We will be the last man standing,” Leduc told Reuters. He said the company would be strengthened by a recent restructuring and efforts to improve the company’s risk management and discipline on new development programs, regardless of whether it was eventually sold or spun off as a standalone company. The company’s development of autonomous flight control systems could help it reduce the weight of helicopters in coming years, lowering costs, and should help boost sales, Leduc said. He said new systems that allow better monitoring of aircraft components could also give the company an edge, he said. Excluding Sikorsky, United Technologies said it now expects 2015 earnings per share of $6.35 to $6.55 on sales of approximately $58 billion to $59 billion. The company said it continued to expect organic sales growth of 3 to 5 percent. The company lowered its forecast for earnings per share including Sikorsky to $6.55 to $6.85, down from the previous expectation of $6.85 to $7.05. It said the change reflected about $0.10 to $0.20 of one-time separation costs along with a $0.10 decline in Sikorsky’s revised expectations for the year. Sikorsky announced earlier this month that it would cut 1,400 jobs and consolidate facilities. Leduc said the company was reducing its facilities footprint by 1 million square feet, or about a third, to adjust for lower revenues in the near term.

Leduc said the Saudi order could cover a large number of aircraft, but declined to provide any further details.

594,UTX,AIRSHOW-Russia's United Aircraft Corp eyes new wide-body jet with Chinese by 2025,"PARIS, June 15 (Reuters) - Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation wants a new wide-body aircraft it is developing with a Chinese company to be flying by 2025, as part of an ambitious project to take on Western planemakers Airbus and Boeing Co. Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd and United Aircraft Corporation, both state-controlled companies, have been considering the joint development of a new advanced wide-body jet since May 2014. United Aircraft Corporation’s new president Yury Slyusar, who took the reins in January, said the Russian and Chinese governments would from September be in a position to decide on whether to proceed with the project after it is presented that month. “We would like to develop, certify and produce the first aircraft within ten years, so by 2025 we should begin deliveries,” Slyusar, speaking through a translator, told reporters at the Paris air show on Monday. The joint project could give both China and Russia a chance to compete in the wide-body segment which currently operates as a virtual duopoly under Europe’s Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing. While Soviet Russia had developed wide-body technology some decades ago, Slyusar said this jet would be a new design. “The aircraft has to be developed from scratch,” he said. “The level of the Chinese industry that we’re seeing leads us to believe that it will be a very innovative aircraft.” China is in the process of developing a home-grown narrow-body commercial jet, the Comac C919, but it is behind schedule and delivery could be pushed back as much as two years, dealing a blow to any challenge to Airbus and Boeing in smaller planes. Slyusar acknowledged the plan to compete in wide-bodies was a high stakes game. “It will determine the level of competitiveness of both Russia and China’s aviation industries,” he said. The engine for any new wide-bodied jet would likely be sourced from either U.S. aero-engine maker GE or Britain’s Rolls-Royce, Slyusar added. “We’re not commenting if we’re speaking with them or not because it’s too early, the decision has not been made yet,” a United Aircraft Corporation spokesman said on the sidelines of the press conference.

597,UTX,U.S. probing whether airlines collude to keep airfares high,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday it is investigating whether U.S. airlines worked together illegally to keep airfares high by signaling plans to limit flights. The Justice Department wrote to major U.S. air carriers demanding that they detail decisions to limit the number of seats they offer, and what they’ve said about those plans to investors, securities analysts and the public. Airlines contacted have been asked to provide “available seat miles on a regional and system wide basis” back to January 2010 and a raft of other data.  The top four U.S. carriers American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc  (DAL.N), United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) control some 80 percent of the domestic air travel market. The four confirmed receipt of the regulator’s letter and said they are cooperating fully with the investigation. News of the probe sent the Dow Jones U.S. airlines index .DJUSAR down 2 percent.     Shares of the U.S. carriers have gyrated in recent weeks as investors questioned whether they were planning to add capacity at a pace faster than overall economic growth, which could put  downward pressure on fares. Southwest fueled investor jitters about declining profit margins in May when it unveiled plans to boost capacity by as much as 8 percent this year from 2014, although it later revised the expected increase to 7 percent.  But carriers have started taking flights off their fall schedules and postponing aircraft deliveries in response to Wall Street concerns that adding more flights and seats could erode fares and margins.     Mergers, new fees imposed on passengers and caution about adding capacity have boosted U.S. airline earnings after a decade of bankruptcies following the September 11, 2001 attacks. In the past year, tumbling oil prices have helped the carriers post billion-dollar profits. The probe focusing on whether the top U.S. carriers are colluding domestically comes as some of the same airlines complain that foreign rivals are competing unfairly on some overseas routes. U.S. carriers have asked the Obama administration to freeze access to U.S. airports by three Gulf airlines for allegedly receiving state subsidies. The Gulf airlines deny that they have received subsidies in violation of trade agreements. The U.S. airlines also have fought plans by low-cost Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL) to expand its U.S. flights under an Irish subsidiary, with claims that it will undermine wages and working standards. Consumer advocates and some lawmakers praised the Justice department action focusing on domestic fares. “This investigation must be tireless and timely to save consumers from the onslaught of price increases in summer fares,” U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal said in a statement. The airlines and their defenders say ticket prices have fallen in 2015 while capacity this summer has reached a post-recession high. “Our members compete vigorously every day, and the traveling public has been the beneficiary,” trade group Airlines for America said in a statement Wednesday.     Separately, Connecticut’s attorney general sent letters to the four carriers last week asking whether they have coordinated prices, citing recent statements at an industry conference held last month in Miami.

The company could still decide against an outright sale and instead spin off Sikorsky to shareholders in a tax-free deal, the people added, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Last month, UTC announced it was exiting the helicopter business and would either sell or spin off Sikorsky, which has come under pressure in the commercial market, where lower energy prices have slashed demand from the oil and gas sector. Textron, which has a market capitalization of about $12 billion and is up against a much larger suitor, has reached out to private equity firms to put together a cash bid for Sikorsky, the people said. Lockheed Martin has a market value of about $60 billion. Textron, maker of Bell helicopters and Cessna aircraft, had initially proposed a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT) merger between Sikorsky and Textron, a transaction that allows a parent company to sell its subsidiary while avoiding a hefty tax bill, Reuters previously reported. UTC made clear it was not interested in acquiring a stake in Textron as part of the more complex transaction, the sources said. People familiar with the process had said that arrangement would have had substantial tax savings. Textron then reached out private equity firms for help to make a cash offer, the sources said. Boeing Co (BA.N), which had expressed interest in a potential deal, is no longer active in the sale process, the sources said. Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA), the world’s largest civil helicopter maker which has said it is keeping an eye on the fate of Sikorsky, is not in the race to acquire it, another source familiar with the situation said. Representatives for UTC, Lockheed, Textron, Boeing and Airbus declined comment. Analysts have focused on Textron as the likeliest buyer, given its interest in beefing up its existing Bell Helicopter business. But industry executives said there could be antitrust questions on the commercial side, given that both companies make helicopters in similar market segments. For Lockheed, acquiring Sikorsky would be the first major acquisition for Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson, who has helped nearly double the company’s share price since taking over as CEO in January 2013. Sikorsky is seen as a “signature company” that could help Lockheed produce strong revenues in the medium term, when production of the F-35 fighter jet program begins to taper off, said one of the sources. “It would certainly help Lockheed diversify its portfolio,” said one of the sources. Lockheed and Sikorsky already work together on several major helicopter programs, including the presidential helicopter, a combat rescue helicopter and the MH-60R- and S-model helicopters built for the Navy and Marine Corps.

599,UTX,United Airlines expects profit margin in lower range of outlook,"(Reuters) - United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) said on Thursday its pretax profit margin for the second quarter will be in the lower range of its earlier outlook and said the strong U.S. dollar has hurt demand from travelers abroad. The Chicago-based airline said it expects a pretax margin of 12 to 13 percent for the quarter ended June 30. Its prior forecast was for a pretax margin of 12 to 14 percent. It said its quarterly capacity grew some 2.3 percent from a year earlier, in the lower range of earlier guidance of 2.25 to 3.25 percent growth. Investors have called on U.S. airlines to taper their capacity growth to match weaker demand. United said it expects passenger revenue per available seat mile, which measures sales relative to the capacity and distance of flights, to have fallen between 5.25 percent and 5.75 percent year-over-year, within the range of the prior outlook. The carrier said it expects gross capital expenditures were higher than it previously forecast for the quarter because of a change in timing of aircraft-related deposits. It now expects to have spent between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion, up from prior guidance of $885 million to $905 million. It said it had $5 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter.

600,UTX,United Tech faces growth challenges as Sikorsky divestment nears,"(Reuters) - As United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) nears a decision on how it will divest its Sikorsky helicopter division, the U.S. conglomerate faces challenges to its financial outlook that may limit the lift to its stock in the near term. UTC shares have declined 5 percent this year, hurt by the  global economic jitters that have spooked shareholders of many multinational manufacturers, investors and analysts said on Thursday. Stock market upheaval in China and stalled sales at some of its businesses also darken the horizon.  “As long as there’s economic weakness outside the U.S., which doesn’t seem to be lifting anytime soon, it’s going to be one of those stocks that suffers,” said Keith Davis, principal at investment management firm Farr, Miller & Washington, which holds about 250,000 UTC shares. UTC has twice trimmed its 2015 profit forecast this year, and recently signaled further pressure. In an analyst meeting last month, it pointed to weak equipment order trends at its Otis elevators business, which accounts for about one-fourth of its operating profit and is dependent on China.  Since then, the Chinese stock market rout has heightened concern about the country’s economy. China has been expected to account for about two-thirds of all new elevator sales this year, analysts at William Blair said this week. Also, UTC said last month its UTAS aircraft components and systems unit would not hit sales growth targets in the commercial after market business. “It’s hard to see a real catalyst” for the stock, said Chip Pettengill, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which holds more than 520,000 shares. “The stock is probably going to be stuck for a while.” Following UTC’s June announcement that it would split off Sikorsky, Reuters reported on Wednesday that Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Textron Inc (TXT.N) have emerged as final contenders to buy it, with a decision possible by month’s end.  UTC, however, could decide instead to spin Sikorsky off. While a strong sale price might boost the stock, benefits from the divestment are now largely incorporated into the shares, Pettengill said. New Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who was elevated to his post in November and subsequently initiated the Sikorsky strategic review, has said he is interested in large acquisitions but that expensive valuations have undercut his desires. How the company decides to use its cash “continues to be a focus of investors,” said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment. Pettengill advocates using some to buy back shares. “I would think the market would perceive that favorably,” he said.

605,UTX,Pentagon says 'closely monitoring' potential Sikorsky sale,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department said on Tuesday it was “closely monitoring” the potential sale of helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft by its parent company, United Technologies Corp and that it would evaluate any deal on a case-by-case basis. Sources familiar with the situation say Lockheed Martin Corp, maker of F-35 fighter jets and the Pentagon’s biggest supplier, is the leading candidate to buy Sikorsky, the Pentagon’s leading helicopter supplier, in a deal that could value the business at more than $8 billion. Lockheed is in advanced talks with UTC and a deal could be announced early next week before both companies report their second quarter earnings, the sources said. Textron Inc, the parent of Bell Helicopter, had been bidding for the firm but has dropped out of the running, according to one of the sources.  Pentagon spokeswoman Maureen Schumann declined comment on the potential bids, but said it was important to the department to maintain competition and avoid market distortions. The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger or acquisition involving its key suppliers during a federal antitrust review, which in this case could be led by the U.S. Justice Department.  Lockheed has had its eye on the more than 90-year-old helicopter maker for years, said one of the sources. The deal would allow Lockheed to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on the $391 billion F-35 fighter jet program, the sources said. The F-35 program already accounts for about 18 percent of the company’s overall revenues, and that percentage is slated to rise to 25 percent by 2025 - well over the 20-percent threshold viewed as reasonable by investors. But the acquisition would expand Lockheed’s influence and importance to the U.S. military, a fact that has caused some concern among U.S. military services, according to several sources familiar with the issue. “Scale is a big issue.

The concerns were unlikely to scuttle a Lockheed purchase, the source said, but could prompt antitrust officials to impose some conditions on a deal.

610,UTX,Exclusive: Lockheed to buy United Tech's Sikorsky for over $8 billion,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) has agreed to buy United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) Sikorsky Aircraft for over $8 billion, two sources said on Sunday, cementing a deal that would confirm Lockheed’s dominance in weapons making and giving the Black Hawk helicopter to the maker of the F-35 fighter jet. The deal will add further heft to Lockheed, which already has annual revenues of around $45 billion and dwarves its nearest competitors, the defense business of Boeing Co (BA.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N). It will make Lockheed less reliant on the $391 billion F-35 fighter jet business, while expanding its overseas sales by adding Sikorsky’s iconic Black Hawk helicopters to a product line that already spans everything from satellites to naval ships. The two companies plan to announce the deal on Monday before both report second-quarter results on Tuesday, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. It will be Lockheed’s largest acquisition since it bought Martin Marietta Corp for about $10 billion two decades ago. It is the first major strategic move for both United Tech Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes, who was elevated to CEO from finance chief in November, and Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who took her job in January 2013. United Technologies and Lockheed officials declined comment.  Textron Inc (TXT.N), parent of Bell Helicopter, had submitted a bid for Sikorsky, but dropped out of the bidding after the price rose, according to several sources familiar with the matter. Both helicopter makers have seen revenues drop due to lower demand from the oil and gas sector. Pentagon officials last week said they would carefully evaluate any sale of Sikorsky, saying it was important to the department to maintain competition and avoid market distortions. The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving its key suppliers during a federal antitrust review, which in this case could be led by the U.S. Justice Department. Industry executives do not expect antitrust objections since Lockheed does not build helicopters, but said U.S. officials could ask for certain written assurances given Lockheed’s expanded scale. “It’s a big deal, but it doesn’t concentrate markets any further than they already were,” said Virginia-based defense consultant Loren Thompson. “There’s no real overlap between the fighter market and the rotorcraft market. They’re discrete markets with different customers and users.” Lockheed is also looking to shed some of its lower-margin services businesses, which could help lower revenues in coming months, according to several sources familiar with the matter. Industry executives have long predicted further consolidation in the U.S. defense market after a massive contraction in the 1990s after the Cold War. The only sector that had remained largely unscathed was the helicopter market. Boeing, which makes CH-47 Chinook helicopters and works with Bell on the V-22, has already teamed up with Sikorsky to develop a next-generation helicopter for the U.S. military. UTC in March said it would explore alternatives for Sikorsky, which accounted for $7.5 billion in sales last year out of total UTC revenues of $65 billion. In June, it said it would exit the helicopter business and sell or spin off Sikorsky, which expects slower revenue growth and has lower profit margins than other UTC divisions. Sikorsky’s fit with United Tech, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators, had been long debated on Wall Street.  Sikorsky’s first-quarter operating profit dropped 11 percent on a 7 percent fall in sales. In June, the unit announced 1,400 job cuts and said it would consolidate facilities. The price of the acquisition was inflated by a huge tax bill facing UTC since Sikorsky’s value has appreciated so much since it became part of United Tech in 1929. UTC could use the funds for other large acquisitions, although the CEO has said the high valuations of targets have made potential transactions expensive. Lockheed decided to proceed with the deal, despite the hefty price tag, because it views Sikorsky as a “signature company” that will ensure strong revenues in the medium term, when F-35 production begins to taper off, according to two of the sources. Lockheed and Sikorsky already work together on several major helicopter programs, including the presidential helicopter, a combat rescue helicopter and the MH-60R- and S-model helicopters built for the Navy and Marine Corps. Sikorsky’s strong foreign sales would help Lockheed expand its international footprint, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group. “It’s a great business for them to own. In addition to the F-35 and the C-130J, Sikorsky is another great brand for them to underpin their defense strategy,” he said. Lockheed is keen to preserve the Sikorsky brand, the sources said, which means the company may well allow Sikorsky to continue functioning as a standalone business instead of integrating it into its already huge Aeronautics division, which had revenues of over $14 billion last year. Other big aerospace companies, including Italy’s Finmeccanica SpA, Europe’s Airbus and Textron Inc, allow their helicopter businesses to operate as separate units.

611,UTX,Lockheed to buy Black Hawk maker Sikorsky for $9 billion,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp said Monday it would buy Black Hawk maker Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp for $9 billion, cementing Lockheed’s dominance in weapons making. Lockheed will also review the possible sale or spin off of $6 billion in other information technology and services businesses. The Pentagon’s largest supplier called Sikorsky a “national icon” and said the net cost of the deal was around $7.1 billion, taking into account tax benefits. Lockheed also reported higher earnings and revenue for the second quarter. The deal, first reported by Reuters on Sunday, also opens key foreign markets for Lockheed, which has annual revenues of $45 billion. It already dwarves its nearest competitors, the defense business of Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp. It comes just months after UTC said it would explore alternatives for Sikorsky, which it has owned since 1929 and which accounted for $7.5 billion in sales last year out of total UTC revenues of $65 billion.    This is Lockheed’s largest acquisition since it bought Loral Corp’s defense electronics business for $9.1 billion in 1996, and its $10 billion merger with Martin Marietta in 1994. It marks the first major strategic move for both United Tech CEO Greg Hayes, who was elevated from finance chief in November, and Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who took her job in January 2013. The two sides wrapped up key aspects of the deal late last week before Hewson jetted off to an annual UK air show, the Royal International Air Tattoo. Hewson returned in time for a telephone board meeting on Sunday evening that endorsed the deal, according to sources familiar with the process. The news buoyed Lockheed shares close to February record highs set. Shares were up 1.8 percent at $204.78; United Tech shares were about 0.4 percent lower at $110.30. “Sikorsky is a natural fit for Lockheed Martin and complements our broad portfolio of world-class aerospace and defense products and technologies,” Hewson told analysts on an earnings call.  She said the deal would give Lockheed access to a $30 billion annual military and commercial rotorcraft market, and said Lockheed expected Sikorsky’s commercial helicopter business to recover from an oil-price related slump in coming years. Lockheed, which makes F-35 fighter jets, naval ships and government satellites, said it would continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and to reduce outstanding share count to below 300 million shares by the end of 2017.  Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro, who represents the Connecticut district where Sikorsky is based, said company President Bob Leduc assured her early Monday that Sikorsky would retain collective bargaining agreement and keep its name. Sikorsky has about 15,000 workers around the world. Pentagon officials had no immediate comment on the deal. Last week, they said they would carefully evaluate any sale of Sikorsky, saying it was important to maintain competition and avoid market distortions. The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving key suppliers during a federal antitrust review, which in this case could be led by the U.S. Justice Department. Hewson said Pentagon officials planned a detailed review, but she did not expect major obstacles. Hewson said the deal would not reduce the number of competitors in the helicopter business, and Lockheed’s plans to sell or spin off $6 billion in other businesses meant the company’s overall size would not grow substantially. “Between those two elements, it is very positive,” Hewson told analysts when asked about the Pentagon’s initial reaction. Lockheed, advised on the acquisition by Credit Suisse and Fried Frank, said expects to close the Sikorsky transaction by late in the fourth quarter or early in 2016. Lockheed said it would complete a strategic review of its government IT infrastructure services business and the technical services business within its missiles and fire control segment by the end of the year, potentially affecting about 17,000 employees. The company said it would retain services businesses focused on defense and intelligence customers, including its extensive cybersecurity work for the U.S. government. UTC said proceeds from the Sikorsky sale would fund more share buybacks. Its board authorized a share buyback of up to 75 million shares, worth about $8.3 billion based on Friday’s closing price.

612,UTX,Lockheed expects positive Pentagon view on Sikorsky buy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp on Monday said Pentagon officials planned a detailed review of the company’s bid to acquire Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter unit of United Technologies Corp, but it did not expect major obstacles. Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said the deal would not reduce the number of competitors in the helicopter sector, and a strategic review aimed at selling or spinning off $6 billion of the company’s services and IT businesses would help streamline a crowded sector. Carrying out both actions at the same time also meant Lockheed’s overall size would not grow substantially, she said, addressing some concerns raised by industry executives about the scale that Lockheed would attain by bolting on Sikorsky. “Between those two elements, it is very positive,” Hewson told analysts when asked about the Pentagon’s initial reaction. Pentagon spokeswoman Maureen Schumann said Lockheed had informed the department about its bid for Sikorsky before Monday’s announcement, but declined to comment further. Analysts and industry executives said they expected major consolidation moves in the services segment in coming months, given Lockheed’s announcement and moves by other companies. But the company’s decision to buy Sikorsky is unlikely to trigger a new wave of consolidation among prime contractors in the weapons market, which was already whittled down to five major players after the end of the Cold War in the 1990s. Jeff Bialos, a former senior U.S. defense official and partner with Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan, said there was no sign that the Pentagon has changed its policy to discourage hook-ups among first-tier or big prime contractors. He said he expected the Defense Department to conduct a thorough review of the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal, which would look at both the scale of the company post-acquisition, conflicts of interest, and any adverse impact on suppliers or competitors. Lockheed’s agreement with UTC shows the company is bracing for possible divestments, including up to $650 million in parts of its mission systems and training business, according to the sales agreement with UTC. Sikorsky’s X2 helicopter technology was exempted from potential divestments. The contract also spells out Lockheed’s agreement to accept certain “behaviorial limitations, conduct restrictions or similar commitments” if required to do so by the government.   Bialos said there would be input from other companies and that a second 30-day review period was likely under a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust process. The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving suppliers during a federal antitrust review. Foreign governments and entities can also raise concerns, said one industry executive. Lockheed said it aims to complete the process by late 2015 or early 2016. Its agreement with UTC requires a deal to be reached within nine months, with a possible 120 day extension.

Lockheed, which earlier announced a bid to buy Sikorsky from United Technologies Corp for $9 billion, said it was well-placed to help Sikorsky deal with any challenges on several military helicopter programs that are under development.

615,UTX,"With Sikorsky sale done, United Technologies eyes acquisitions","(Reuters) - Now that United Technologies Corp Chief Executive Greg Hayes has closed a deal to sell the conglomerate’s Sikorsky helicopter unit, he may become an acquirer in his own right. United Tech shares slipped 0.7 percent on Monday after news of the $9 billion sale to Lockheed Martin Inc became official. Even though analysts applauded the price, investors may have already incorporated the benefits from splitting off the lower-margin business, a move United Tech had been signaling for months.  Also, United Tech, which reports earnings on Tuesday, will lose Sikorsky’s profit contribution, estimated by Sterne Agee CRT at 6.5 percent of overall operating earnings this year.  It plans to offset that decline by using the deal’s proceeds to repurchase shares, thus bolstering earnings per share. It has authorized a buyback of some $8 billion. But Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said he believes that if the right acquisition comes along, United Tech could divert those funds from the buyback allocation. “There’s an asterisk on it,” Arnold said. Hayes, who became CEO in November, has consistently said he wants to make acquisitions to boost the conglomerate’s prospects. Without Sikorsky, United Tech is squarely focused in two areas: jet engines and other commercial aerospace systems and components; and elevators, climate control units and security systems for commercial buildings. Hayes has said he prefers large deals but that his ambitions have been undercut by high prices of potential targets. Even if United Tech uses the Sikorsky proceeds on buybacks, “they still have balance sheet flexibility to pursue acquisitions,” said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment. Potential targets include electrical and lighting systems company Hubbell Inc, Dublin-based security firm Allegion and British aircraft parts supplier Meggitt, Credit Suisse analysts said in a research note on Monday. Some analysts said United Tech was more likely to use its cash held overseas for a foreign takeover, leaving the Sikorsky proceeds for buybacks. United Tech had $5.28 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as of March 31, according to its most recent such disclosure. More than 97 percent of its cash was held by foreign subsidiaries as of that date, the filing said. “If you think about markets starting to get better, Europe is one of those and that’s where an awful lot of that cash is,” said Scott Lawson, vice president of investment management firm Westwood Holdings Group.

United Tech, whose shares fell 4.1 percent after the company also reported second-quarter results, on Monday said it would sell its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin Inc (LMT.N) for $9 billion, after saying in June it planned to exit the business following a strategic review. Excluding Sikorsky, United Tech now expects earnings from continuing operations in a range of $6.15 to $6.30 per share this year, down from the prior range of $6.35 to $6.55 per share.  The company said the commercial aftermarket for its UTC Aerospace Systems business will be “significantly below” expectations.  United Tech has been hurt as airlines have provisioned fewer replacement parts than expected for new aircraft for their maintenance stations, Chief Executive Greg Hayes said in an interview. The company, which already twice this year had trimmed its 2015 outlook, also cited struggles for its Otis elevators business in Europe and China. “It’s a big take down and nobody is happy about it,” Hayes said in an interview. “I thought we had to just be realistic in terms of the second half.” With the fate of Sikorsky settled, Hayes said the company was ready to turn its focus to acquisitions, and was “looking at everything from $500 million to $5 billion.” “We’re done shrinking UTC with the completion of this divestiture,” Hayes said. The U.S conglomerate said that second-quarter net income fell to $1.54 billion, or $1.73 per share, from $1.68 billion, or $1.84 per share, a year ago. Analysts were looking for $1.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 5 percent to $16.33 billion, hurt by the impact of the strong dollar on foreign sales. On an organic basis, revenue rose by 3 percent. Through Monday, the company's shares had fallen about 4 percent so far this year against a 3.4 percent rise for the S&P; 500 index .SPX.

622,UTX,United Tech CEO has rough day with third profit outlook cut,"(Reuters) - A day after sealing the signature move of his eight-month tenure, United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) Chief Executive Greg Hayes suffered his toughest day on Wall Street. The U.S. conglomerate cut its 2015 profit forecast on Tuesday for the third time this year, sending its shares down more than 7 percent and carving $7 billion off its market value. “To say that I’m disappointed would be a significant understatement,” Hayes told analysts on a conference call. United Tech agreed on Monday to sell its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) for $9 billion, ending a strategic review that Hayes initiated in March. After the latest forecast cut, blamed on weaker expected performance in its aerospace systems and Otis elevators businesses, Hayes vowed he would take “another hard look” at restructuring, including potential cost cuts. He told analysts he was “spending more time on the road to make sure that we truly understand what’s going on in these individual businesses.” The lowered outlook is a setback for Hayes, the company’s former finance chief. Since taking over as CEO in late November, the company cut its profit forecasts in January and June.  One analyst described the repeated cuts as “water torture” on the conference call.

623,UTX,United Tech CEO has rough day with third profit outlook cut,"July 21 (Reuters) - A day after sealing the signature move of his eight-month tenure, United Technologies Corp  Chief Executive Greg Hayes suffered his toughest day on Wall Street. The U.S. conglomerate cut its 2015 profit forecast on Tuesday for the third time this year, sending its shares down more than 7 percent and carving $7 billion off its market value. “To say that I’m disappointed would be a significant understatement,” Hayes told analysts on a conference call. United Tech agreed on Monday to sell its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin Corp for $9 billion, ending a strategic review that Hayes initiated in March. After the latest forecast cut, blamed on weaker expected performance in its aerospace systems and Otis elevators businesses, Hayes vowed he would take “another hard look” at restructuring, including potential cost cuts. He told analysts he was “spending more time on the road to make sure that we truly understand what’s going on in these individual businesses.” The lowered outlook is a setback for Hayes, the company’s former finance chief. Since taking over as CEO in late November, the company cut its profit forecasts in January and June. One analyst described the repeated cuts as “water torture” on the conference call.

632,UTX,Lockheed Sikorsky deal marks turning point for more assertive CEO,"WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp’s  decision to buy helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft and sell $6 billion in lower-margin units marks a clear turning point for Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who is shaking up the world’s largest weapons maker. Thrust into the CEO job in January 2013 after retiring CEO Robert Stevens’ designated successor was fired for having an affair with a subordinate, Hewson spent her first year largely executing a strategy Stevens had mapped out and repairing tense ties with the Pentagon on the $391 billion F-35 fighter program. Over the past 18 months, the seemingly mild-mannered engineer who is ranked No. 4 on Fortune’s list of most powerful U.S. women executives, has grown more assertive, her power buoyed by a powerful share price rally that has earned her the respect of her board and key shareholders. Lockheed shares closed at $202.79 on Wednesday, not far off a historic high of $207 reached in February. “It’s a great story. The accidental CEO steps in, doubles the share price, raises margins and then executes the biggest M&A; deal the company has done in two decades,” said one industry executive familiar with Hewson’s career. “But remember, the higher you aim, the greater the crash if things don’t work out.” Indeed, the Sikorsky acquisition could test the 61-year-old executive’s legacy of pleasing investors by running a tight ship. Industry executives said Hewson’s track record of cutting costs - she pared the company’s workforce by 8,000 people, or 6.7 percent, closed facilities and streamlined its structure - helped her convince Lockheed’s generally conservative board to make a bet on the helicopter maker. That may not have been an easy call given a market downturn and uncertain outlook for near-term military sales. To seal the takeover of the unit that United Technologies Corp  unloaded because of its narrow margins, Lockheed agreed to pay a premium $9 billion for a company projecting revenues of just $6.5 billion. A 30-year veteran of Lockheed, Hewson has focused on long-term investments, like “over the horizon” projects such as work on a portable fusion energy reactor, where she has channeled some savings from the recent cost cuts. In February, she told reporters that companies needed to “see the big picture” on challenges such climate change, energy and other national security threats. Her legacy and the future outlook of the Pentagon’s biggest supplier will be shaped by Lockheed’s ability to integrate Sikorsky, offload its services business, and keep key programs like the F-35 and Sikorsky’s presidential helicopter on track. Officials are also anxiously awaiting the outcome of two military competitions - a new Air Force bomber valued at over $80 billion for which Lockheed is teamed with Boeing Co, and a multibillion-dollar ground vehicle competition to replace tens of thousands of military vehicles. “These deals are critical to helping her solidify her personal leadership since Lockheed has been heavily focused in recent years on share repurchases, dividends and turning F-35 around,” said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant. Sikorsky is Lockheed’s biggest takeover since it bought Loral Corp’s defense electronics business for $9.1 billion in 1996, and is just shy of the $10 billion merger with Martin Marietta in 1994 that created the company as it stands today. An executive at another firm that looked at buying Sikorsky cautioned that the deal is not without risks, given the threat of further defense budget cuts, issues with several helicopter development programs, and overall cost of the deal. Lockheed would also face difficult contract negotiations in coming years with Sikorsky’s unions. Still, Hewson was intent on adding another “signature” product line to help balance the company’s portfolio, which is growing increasingly dependent on the F-35, according to sources familiar with the company. She had Sikorsky “in her sights” after her days working on the MH-60R and MH60S helicopters the two company co-produce for the Navy. Beyond the risks in Sikorsky, losing either one of the big weapons programs on the table would also be a big setback given how much the company has invested in both, analysts said. Executives who have worked closely with Hewson describe her as tough and detail-oriented, someone who demands a lot of herself and others around her. An early riser who dashes off emails well before dawn, Hewson is not someone prone to fly off the handle when something goes wrong, associates say. Married and the mother of two grown sons, Hewson promotes diversity programs within the company and writes a regular blog for networking site LinkedIn. She also often brings in writers like “The Tipping Point” author Malcolm Gladwell to explore new ideas and stimulate conversations with her leadership team. In a May LinkedIn posting, Hewson drew on her own experience to urge workers to push themselves beyond their comfort zone. “Don’t limit yourself by doubting your ability to step up to a challenge ... Take advantage of the growth opportunities that come your way - even if they might seem like a reach,” she said, adding, “results matter.”       (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Christian Plumb)",7222015,http://www.reuters.com/article/lockheed-martin-hewson/lockheed-sikorsky-deal-marks-turning-point-for-more-assertive-ceo-idUSL1N1021KF20150722
633,UTX,China slowdown? Depends on where you look,"NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - Many U.S. consumer companies are brushing aside worries that China’s weakening economy and sputtering stock market will dramatically damage their bottom lines even with early trouble signs in recent earnings reports. Most notably, companies dependent on Chinese infrastructure growth, such as United Technologies Corp and Caterpillar Inc, are claiming soft second-quarter earnings and a downgraded outlook based on weakened Chinese demand. Consumer companies like United Continental Holdings Inc , Apple Inc and General Motors Co, on the other hand, continue to paint a rosy picture based on continued strong demand by the Chinese consumer. The Chinese economy has faced difficulties this year as decelerating growth in factory output, retail sales and domestic investment has been compounded by a slowing property market. China’s economy is expected to expand 7 percent this year, with growth slowing to 6.7 percent in 2016, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Thursday. “We have been worried about it,” Steve Weeple, head of global equities at global asset manager Standard Life Investments in Boston, told Reuters. “We would certainly not be surprised to see some of the big consumer packaged goods companies, some of the industrials, reporting that China activity is probably a little below headline growth rates.” Furthermore, a 30 percent early summer selloff in the Chinese stock market could hit companies more broadly in the third quarter. Names that have a reliance on infrastructure growth in China have been hit the hardest so far this quarter. United Technologies fell 7 percent on Tuesday, its worst drop in nearly 4 years, after cutting its full-year profit outlook, in part due to slowness in its elevators business in China as the nation’s housing market cools. Caterpillar shares had their worst performance in six months on Thursday after the construction and mining equipment maker reported lower quarterly profit and sales, citing slower construction in China. Even smaller names, generally thought to be more insulated to global economic pressures as a greater portion of their revenue is derived from within the U.S., have noted softness within China’s infrastructure. “We’re seeing real industry pressure in construction, in agriculture, in truck and bus inside China - there’s been industry contraction in construction (business) year-on-year,” Rich Lavin, CEO of Commercial Vehicle Group Inc which supplies cab-related products for trucks, bus, farming and other types of vehicles, told Reuters in mid-June before entering its quiet period ahead of earnings. But consumer-facing companies are telling a brighter tale. Harley-Davidson Inc saw a 5 percent pop in its shares on Tuesday, its biggest percentage gain since October,  after its quarterly results showed a 16.6 percent jump in Asia-Pacific sales, which the company attributed to strong demand for its street motorcycles in China and India. “You have to look company by company and product line by product line because there are some things for which there is no substitute,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “It’s the cool factor for Harley Davidson.” United Continental, which flies more to China than any of its U.S. rivals, says the region remains a good investment. “The demand is still growing,” said Chief Revenue Officer Jim Compton. Despite flat June auto sales in China, General Motors Co  also cited continued strength in China in its earnings report on Thursday, and said it expects to maintain strong profitability there. Shares of the automaker advanced 4 percent to $31.50. The same brand name appeal mentioned by Forrest may be bolstering Apple’s China sales. Though the company’s shares tumbled nearly 7 percent after its forward-looking guidance missed estimates, it reported a 112 percent sales increase in China over last year and said it plans to open 40 stores in China in the next 12 months. “China was simply spectacular for us,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer. “We feel it is a long runway for us in China.”   (Additional reporting by Joseph White, Jeffrey Dastin, Julia Love and David Gaffen; Editing by Linda Stern and Alan Crosby)",7232015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-results-china/china-slowdown-depends-on-where-you-look-idUSL1N1022SO20150723
634,UTX,UPDATE 1-U.S. DOJ starts criminal probe into Sikorsky Navy contract,"(Adds United Technologies, Lockheed comments) July 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has informed Sikorsky Aircraft that it has started a criminal investigation into allegations the helicopter maker overbilled the U.S. Navy for a contract, Sikorsky’s parent company, United Technologies Corp, said on Friday. The Justice Department told Sikorsky of the probe on July 13, and requested that Sikorsky and two subsidiaries produce documents, United Tech said in its quarterly securities filing. (1.usa.gov/1frCTKr). The U.S. government is also seeking about $148 million related to the claims, United Tech said in the filing. Disclosure of the probe follows United Tech’s announcement on Monday that it will sell Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin Corp  for $9 billion. “Sikorsky and its subsidiaries intend to cooperate fully in the investigation, which was discussed as part of the transaction with Lockheed Martin and is not expected to affect the close,” a United Technologies spokesman said in a statement. Lockheed said in a statement: “We were made aware of the issue during our due diligence and negotiation process and we will continue to monitor the issue in close collaboration with UTC.” The Navy awarded Sikorsky unit Sikorsky Support Services Inc (SSSI) a contract for fixed-wing turboprop training aircraft in 2006. SSSI subcontracted another Sikorsky unit, Derco Aerospace, to procure spare parts. The government alleges that SSSI overbilled the Navy because Derco added profit and overhead costs to the price of the spare parts that it procured and sold to SSSI. United Tech had previously disclosed the allegations and that the U.S. government had filed a complaint in October. The company said it believes Derco was lawfully allowed to add profit and overhead to the cost of the parts. United Tech shares were off 1 percent at $100.10 on Friday morning. Lockheed was off 0.6 percent at $201.65 on a down day for the U.S. market broadly.

635,UTX,United Tech top building systems executive to depart,"July 27 (Reuters) - The executive in charge of United Technologies Corp’s building systems business, Geraud Darnis, is leaving the company in the latest management change at the U.S. conglomerate. As president of UTC Building & Industrial Systems, Darnis has been overseeing divisions that accounted for just less than half of the company’s $65 billion in revenue last year. The divisions include Otis elevators and Carrier climate control systems. Darnis, a 32-year United Tech veteran, will retire in January, the company said in announcing his departure on Monday. The news came less than a week after United Tech cut its 2015 profit outlook for the third time this year, in part because of weaker expected results at Otis, sending its shares down 7 percent. Darnis’s departure is the latest executive change under United Tech Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who was promoted from finance chief in November. Alain Bellemare, who held a similar role to Darnis overseeing United Tech’s aerospace divisions, left the company at the start of the year and is now CEO of Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. In a statement, Hayes said he would work with Darnis over the next few months “to ensure a smooth and successful transition of the leadership responsibilities for UTC Building & Industrial Systems”. Darnis became head of building systems after United Tech combined Otis and its UTC Climate, Controls and Security unit into one business in September 2013. Otis and UTC Climate are seeking to capitalize on growth in cities in emerging markets, but have been hurt by concerns over China’s slowing economy. United Tech shares were down 0.1 percent at $99.20 on Monday morning.

Lockheed said the job cuts were unrelated to the strategic review the company announced in July for its government IT and technical services businesses. The unit, which accounts for about 16 percent of the company’s sales and employs about 24,000 people, has been struggling due to reduced government spending, increased competition and delays in new contracts.

The changes come after United Technologies in July cut its 2015 profit outlook for the third time this year, in part due to weaker expected performance in its Otis business. United Tech two years ago had combined Otis and the climate, controls and security system units into one business, Building & Industrial Systems (BIS).

646,UTX,Pratt prepping for big production increase on F-35 jet engines,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), on Monday said it is working closely with suppliers to prepare for a large ramp-up in production in coming years of the F135 engine that powers the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet. Bennett Croswell, who heads Pratt’s military engines division, said the company was seeking to ensure it had at least two suppliers for every major component, and was also carrying out production readiness reviews of key suppliers, and the companies that build parts for them. “Capacity is good, but we have to make sure we get the quality right as well,” Croswell told Reuters at the annual Air Force Association conference. “We’re ready for the ramp.” The Air Force general who runs the $391 billion F-35 program for the Pentagon said last week that production of the stealth supersonic fighter jet is accelerating rapidly, but the steep ramp-up could stress suppliers. Production of the jets is slated to rise from 40 planes a year to more than 120 a year over the next three years. Croswell said the company was in negotiations with the Pentagon about 160 engines in the next two low-rate production contracts, and agreement should be reached before year-end. He said the ninth batch would include 60 engines, rising to 100 in the tenth batch, with the increase enabling further cost reductions. “It will be a good thing from a cost perspective.” Pratt has already delivered 240 engines, he said, noting the company was meeting cost reduction commitments set in 2009 and a  90-percent reliability target was five years ahead of schedule. Pratt is encouraging U.S. officials to consider engine upgrades that would draw on the company’s work on two separate engine improvement programs run by the U.S. Navy and the Air Force, and could improve the engine’s fuel economy by 7 percent. Croswell said the upgrades could be installed on the engines when they come in for major maintenance every eight to 10 years. Pratt also plans to submit a bid in coming days for a separate $1 billion Air Force program aimed at developing a next-generation jet engine with 25 percent greater fuel economy and 10 percent more thrust.  The new “adaptive” engine program aims to develop an engine that can be configured to optimize the jets to fly fast or cover long distances.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission  opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90  additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working  days. Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

654,UTX,UPDATE 1-Pentagon warns against further consolidation among big arms makers,"(Recasts to add Carter, Lockheed comments) By Andrea Shalal and Yeganeh Torbati WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Pentagon officials warned on Wednesday against further consolidation in the U.S. weapons industry because fewer defense contractors could lead to higher costs, decreased innovation and less competition. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said he does not welcome further consolidation among large U.S. weapons makers. Carter was the Pentagon’s chief arms buyer in 2011, when the department established a policy that discouraging mergers among large prime contractors, but opened the door to deals among smaller firms. “What I said then and still believe is that it was important to avoid excessive consolidation in the defense industry to the point where we did not have multiple vendors who could compete with one another on many programs,” Carter told reporters. The comments came days after the U.S. Justice Department approved Lockheed Martin Corp’s $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp , one of the biggest acquisitions in the weapons industry in years. Lockheed expects to close the deal by the end of November or sooner, depending on when it wins regulatory approval from China and the European Union. “Lockheed-Sikorsky doesn’t mean open season on large prime-level mergers,” said Jeff Bialos, a former senior Pentagon official who oversaw industry mergers and acquisitions. Dozens of companies in the sector merged in the 1990s as military spending fell sharply after the end of the Cold War. The changes left five large contractors that dominate the market: Lockheed, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp , General Dynamics Corp and Raytheon Co. Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall told reporters the U.S. Justice Department had cleared the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal because there was no direct anti-competitive issue, but the department did not want to see its industrial base whittled down to two or three very large suppliers. He said the Pentagon would continue working with the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to ensure mergers did not reduce competition. Defense officials also planned to meet with Congress to explore legal options to preserve the diversity and breadth of the U.S. defense industry. Kendall said the deal would strengthen Lockheed, the Pentagon’s largest supplier, and further reduce the dwindling number of contractors bidding for weapons contracts. Future deals would be evaluated case-by-case, he said. “This transaction is the most significant change at the weapon system prime level since the large-scale consolidation that followed the end of the Cold War,” he said. He said the deal would move a high percentage of the military helicopter market into a company that dominates the U.S. fighter jet market, due to a winner-take-all approach adopted over a decade ago for the F-35 fighter jet program. “With size comes power, and the department’s experience with large defense contractors is that they are not hesitant to use this power for corporate advantage,” he said. Lockheed fired back in a rare display of disagreement with its largest customer. “There is no evidence to support the view that larger defense companies reduce competition or inhibit innovation,” Lockheed spokesman Dan Nelson said in statement. “We believe that defense contractors should continue to be assessed based on the performance and effectiveness of the products and solutions offered, not on the size of their company,” he said.

656,UTX,Lockheed Martin mulls merger of some services units with peer -sources,"(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp is exploring merging some of its information technology and services businesses, with a value of about $4 billion, with another government services contractor, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The contemplated transaction would create the largest government services contractor in the United States and would generate an estimated $2 billion windfall for Lockheed, the people said. Lockheed, the Pentagon’s largest supplier, is looking to pay down debt following its agreement in July to acquire Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter unit of United Technologies Corp , for $9 billion in cash. CACI International Inc and Science Applications International Corp are in early-stage talks with Lockheed about a so-called Reverse Morris Trust (RMT) deal for the assets, a transaction that would avert a hefty tax bill, the people said. Lockheed has also contacted other companies to determine their interest in a potential RMT deal, including Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp and Leidos Holdings Inc, the people added. The deal under discussion is part of a strategic review that Lockheed announced on July 20. The company said it would carry out a strategic review of government information technology and technical services businesses in two divisions with total estimated 2015 revenue of $6 billion, with the goal of spinning off the units or selling them to outside investors. The sources cautioned that there was no certainty that the RMT option would be chosen, and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Lockheed, Booz Allen Hamilton and Leidos declined to comment, while CACI and Science Applications International did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lockheed makes F-35 fighter jets, naval ships and government satellites. It has been expanding its weapons-making capabilities and moving away from more commoditized services. The programs being reviewed for sale or spinoff are mainly in Lockheed’s information systems and government services business, but also include units in its missiles and fire-control division. The programs, which have more than 17,000 employees, have been struggling due to reduced government spending, increased competition and delays in new contracts. Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed has forecast sales at the information systems unit to decline in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2015. It plans to cut about 500 jobs there by mid-November. Last month, Lockheed said U.S. officials had approved its acquisition of Black Hawk helicopter maker Sikorsky. That deal is expected to close before the end of the year, possibly by late November.

657,UTX,Sikorsky takeover will not affect helicopter program -U.S. Army,"WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The pending takeover of United Technologies Corp’s Sikorsky Aircraft by Lockheed Martin Corp will not affect prototype work on an aircraft that will replace thousands of helicopters, U.S. Army acquisitions chief Heidi Shyu said on Tuesday. Last year one team from Boeing Co and Sikorsky and one team from Textron Inc’s Bell Helicopter were selected to build models of a multi-role vertical-lift aircraft as a part of the U.S. Army’s plan, the JMR technology demonstrator program, to replace aging helicopters. The future vertical life aircraft will replace up to 4,000 medium class UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters built by Sikorsky and Boeing’s Apache attack helicopter. “No, it doesn’t change it because I think what is important is you’ve got the Boeing-Sikorsky team competing against Bell,” Shyu told reporters at the annual Association of United States Army conference in Washington. “As far I know there’s two separate teams,” Shyu said. She said first flight tests were expected in 2017 and would define requirements for the future vertical lift aircraft. The pending Lockheed-Sikorsky deal, worth more than $8 billion, could be important because Lockheed is providing parts for Bell’s V-280 Valor under the demonstrator program. Bell is the prime contractor on the V-280 Valor but has teamed up with 11 other companies for parts. Pentagon arms buyer Frank Kendall has previously said that mergers were increasing the leverage companies have with the U.S. Department of Defense. A representative from Bell said the agreement with Lockheed on the demonstrator had been amended to clarify that they would stay on track after the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal. “I mean the point is it’s not an insignificant event (Lockheed-Sikorsky deal) but it’s not ... sky is falling kind of event either,” said Keith Flail, Bell’s programs director for the demonstrator and vertical lift program. A Sikorsky representative declined to comment on the deal and how it might affect the demonstrator program because the team had not been involved in merger discussions. “But we’re teams on the JMR medium in support of future vertical lift and we are committed to continue that,” said Douglas Shidler, the Sikorsky program director for the JMR technology demonstrator program.

658,UTX,U.S. okays $495 million sale of Sikorsky helicopters to Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government has approved the possible sale to Saudi Arabia of nine UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, in a deal valued at $495 million, the Pentagon said on Wednesday. The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the deal would help improve the security of Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally that is fighting Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen and participating in coalition efforts to fight extremists in Syria. DSCA, which oversees foreign arms sales, said the Saudi government had requested the sale of nine helicopters, 21 T700-GE-701D engines built by General Electric Co , embedded GPS systems, machine guns and missile warning systems. DSCA said the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command (RSLFAC) planned to use the new helicopters for search and rescue, disaster relief, humanitarian support, counterterrorism, and combat operations. U.S. lawmakers have 30 days to block the sale, although such action is rare since arms sales are usually well vetted in advance of a formal notification to Congress.

659,UTX,Lockheed-Sikorsky deal could close by late October -sources,"WASHINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp’s  $9 billion purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp could close by late October or early November, well before the initial year-end target, three sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Lockheed announced last month that officials in the United States, South Korea and Japan had approved the deal, but it was waiting for other regulatory approvals. Regulatory approvals from China and the European Union are expected next week, according to two of the sources, who all said they were not authorized to speak publicly. “The momentum is picking up,” said one of the sources. “The deal should close by late October or early November.” When it announced the deal on July 20, Lockheed said it did not anticipate major hurdles, and expected to close the transaction by late in the fourth quarter of 2015 or early 2016. The acquisition will be Lockheed’s largest since it acquired Loral Corp’s defense electronics business for $9.1 billion in 1996. It will open key foreign markets for Lockheed, which has annual revenues of $45 billion, and already dwarfs its nearest competitors, the defense businesses of Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp. Lockheed is also reviewing the sale or spinoff of $6 billion in businesses in its Information Systems & Government Services and Missiles and Fire Control units. Reuters reported earlier this month that Lockheed is exploring merging some of those businesses, with a value of about $4 billion, with another government services contractor, a move that could generate an estimated $2 billion windfall for Lockheed.

660,UTX,Saudi Arabia signs deal for 320 PAC-3 missiles - Lockheed,"WASHINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia signed an agreement last week with the U.S. government for the purchase of 320 more Patriot PAC-3 missiles built by Lockheed Martin Corp , and may accelerate its plans to buy the longer-range THAAD system, a senior Lockheed official told Reuters this week. The PAC-3 sale is part of a larger possible deal valued at $5.4 billion for a total of 600 PAC-3 missiles that was approved by the U.S. government in July. Such approvals, which do not guarantee a deal will be reached, are followed by negotiations about an actual sale. Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, is participating in coalition efforts to fight Islamic State militants in Syria, while also battling Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have already fired Scud missiles against the kingdom. Saudi Arabia also remains concerned about the growing military strength of Iran. The PAC-3 missile defends against incoming aircraft and missiles, and it is currently used by the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates, according to Lockheed. Joe Garland, vice president of business development for Lockheed’s missiles and fire control division, told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia would likely follow up with a purchase next year of the remaining 280 PAC-3 missiles in the agreement. He said the Gulf country was also looking to accelerate a likely purchase of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system known as THAAD, which is also built by Lockheed, and a deal could be reached in 2017. Lockheed officials had previously said they were upbeat  about the prospects of reaching a THAAD deal, but that it could take three to five years to reach a deal. The U.S. State Department declined comment. Garland said evolving threats in the region had prompted Saudi Arabia to “look at the opportunity to accelerate” that purchase. Riki Ellison, founder of the non-profit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said the urgency of Saudi’s missile defense purchases was driven by Scud missile launches from Yemen and Saudi Arabia’s concerns about Iran. Separately, the U.S. government said on Wednesday it has approved the possible sale to Saudi Arabia of nine UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, in a deal valued at $495 million.

The U.S. aerospace and building systems conglomerate also revealed plans on Tuesday to buy back $12 billion of its stock, sending its shares up 4.9 percent to $96.51 in afternoon trading. “Significant additional restructuring actions” will be announced in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Greg Hayes told analysts on a conference call. “We have seen some opportunities to do some longer-term structural cost reduction.” The company will seek to cut overhead costs, but the focus will be on “factory rationalization,” Hayes said. He said the company would provide more details in December. Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said there were likely restructuring opportunities “across the board,” while noting that United Technologies’ commercial buildings segment had faced challenges in China and Europe. “They’re trying to do what they usually do which is aggressively control costs, and maybe they’re doubling down in that respect to manage to a higher earnings figure,” said Moody’s analyst Russell Solomon. The company backed its 2015 profit forecast, after cutting it three times earlier in the year, which had driven the stock down some 20 percent this year through Monday. Including $4 billion in repurchases made so far this year, United Technologies said it would expect to complete $16 billion of share repurchases through 2017. The new buyback includes a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase using proceeds from its sale of its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin, which United Technologies expects to close in the fourth quarter. “There is such a disconnect between the trading price and the intrinsic value that we find that doing share buyback is the best M&A; that we can do in the short run,” Hayes said in an interview. Even with the share repurchase, Hayes said United Technologies could still make acquisitions. “We’re looking at those deals in the $1 (billion) to $5 billion range and clearly we have the capacity to continue to do those deals,” Hayes said. For the third quarter, United Technologies said net income fell to $1.36 billion from $1.85 billion a year ago. Earnings from continuing operations declined to $1.61 per share from $1.93 a share a year ago. Analysts, on average, were expecting $1.55 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 5.7 percent to $13.79 billion, about $770 million below analysts’ expectations. Sales fell 1 percent, excluding the negative impact from currency swings. The company cited a delay in jet engine deliveries for its Pratt & Whitney division that it expects to recover in the fourth quarter. “Considering the revenue headwinds that UTX faced in the quarter, we view this as a good operating performance,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a research note.

664,UTX,Lockheed tops third-quarter profit view on increased sales of F-35 jets,"(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the Pentagon’s No. 1 weapons supplier, reported better-than-expected quarterly results on higher demand for its F-35 fighter jets, and said it expects full-year revenue at the higher end of its forecast. Revenue at Lockheed’s aeronautics division increased about 11 percent to $3.92 billion in the third quarter, with $500 million coming from additional sales of the F-35 fighter jet, it said on Tuesday. Lockheed is developing and building F-35 jets for the U.S. military and nine other countries. With estimated development and procurement costs of $391 billion for the United States alone, the F-35 is the world’s most expensive weapons program. Lockheed did not address the timing of its planned purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft, but United Technologies Corp (UTX.N),  which owns Sikorsky, expects to close the deal in the fourth quarter. Excluding the Sikorsky deal and a strategic review aimed at selling or spinning off its services businesses, Lockheed said 2016 sales should be comparable with 2015. Total operating margin should range from 11.0 percent to 11.5 percent, down from the expected margin of about 12 percent in 2015, it said. The company sees 2015 sales of $45 billion, and segment operating profit of $5.4 billion. It had forecast sales of $43.5 billion to $45 billion, with segment operating profit of $5.225 billion to $5.375 billion. Lockheed also forecast earnings per share of $11.30 in 2015, the high end of its earlier forecast of $11.00 to $11.30. Analysts, on average, looked for 2015 sales of $44.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lockheed said it had $2.4 billion in potential cost and termination liability exposure, given its decision to self-fund work on C-130J transport planes and F-35 jets for the U.S. government while contracts are being negotiated. It said it was finalizing both agreements with the U.S. government and expected to receive more funding this year. About $750 million in cash the company expected to receive in 2015 could be delayed until 2016. For the quarter ended Sept. 27, total net sales rose to $11.46 billion from $11.11 billion a year earlier. Net income fell to $865 million, or $2.77 per share, from $888 million, or $2.76 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected profit of $2.72 per share on revenue of $11.14 billion.

672,UTX,UPDATE 1-Lockheed promotes Babione to head F-35 fighter jet program,"(Adds details, comment from Pentagon’s F-35 office) WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp  on Thursday said Jeff Babione would head the company’s F-35 fighter jet program, the Pentagon’s single largest arms project, effective Jan. 1. Babione, currently the deputy head of the $391 billion F-35 program, will succeed Lorraine Martin, who will become deputy executive vice president of Lockheed’s Mission Systems and Training business, a newly created position. Babione will become executive vice president and general manager of the F-35 program, overseeing development, production, and sustainment efforts. Babione, who has been Lockheed for nearly 23 years, previously headed the company’s F-16/F-22 fighter programs. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who heads the F-35 program for the Pentagon, said Martin had helped rebuild the relationship between Lockheed and the government. Babione has “the skills and leadership necessary to continue the advancements we’re making in the F-35 program,” Bogdan said. Fred Ross will replace Babione as the deputy on the program. Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of Lockheed’s Aeronautics division, lauded what he called Martin’s outstanding leadership of the F-35 program, citing key milestones such as the Marine Corps’ declaration of an initial combat-ready squadron of the stealthy fighter jets in July, and three years of on-schedule aircraft deliveries. Martin will be the No. 2 executive in charge of the Mission Systems and Training business, which is slated to double its workforce and annual revenue, now at $7.2 billion, when Lockheed completes its $9 billion takeover of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp next month.

The company is now finalizing the initial contract and should complete it this year, Barry McCullough, vice president of international business development for Lockheed’s Mission Systems and Training business, told Reuters in an interview. In addition, he said Saudi Arabia was interested in buying 10 more MH-60R multi-mission helicopters and 10 light utility helicopters, a need which Lockheed believed it could meet with a less capable version of the MH-60R. “We just started talking to them about it. These are initial discussions,” he said. He said the Saudi government would need to submit a separate request for the helicopters, but it would likely opt for a  sole-source contract and not launch a competition for the additional helicopters, a move that could result in maintenance savings. Lockheed last week completed its $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp. Sikorsky is being integrated into Lockheed’s mission systems and training business. The U.S. government in May approved the initial sale of the 10 MH-60R helicopters and associated equipment to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has also expressed interest in buying a large number of Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters in the “relatively near term”, he said.

The U.S. aerospace and building systems conglomerate said 2016 adjusted earnings will be $6.30 to $6.60 per share on revenue of $56 billion to $58 billion. Most of the EPS gain will come from share buybacks, it noted. The company also expects 2015 adjusted earnings of $6.20-$6.30 per share, raising the lower end of the previous estimate by 5 cents. The restructuring will cost about $500 million a year over three years, Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said at an investor and analyst meeting. When completed, the program is expected to generate about $900 million in annual savings, mainly through factory consolidation, Hayes said. United Technologies shares were up 1.4 percent at $95.20 in extended trading. While the restructuring and about $2 billion in research and development spending next year could cause GAAP earnings to fall in 2016, it positions the maker of maker Otis elevators, Carrier heating and cooling systems and Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines for longer-term growth, Hayes said. The company expects slowing in China and weak growth in Latin America and Europe. It also forecasts the dollar at parity with the euro, versus an average of $1.12 per euro this year.  Analysts described the forecast as conservative. But it follows a year in which United Technologies cut its 2015 profit outlook three times and saw its results dented by the strong dollar and pressures in its various businesses. The Pratt & Whitney division is expected to see a slight rise in sales next year, and it faces rising costs as it ramps up production to about 200 units.

UTC said Adams was key in building Pratt’s product line, and the geared turbofan, F135 and PW800 engines have produced Pratt’s largest engine backlog in decades. “Under Paul’s leadership, Pratt & Whitney positioned itself for a bright future,” UTC Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said.

689,UTX,Exclusive: Leidos nears $5 billion deal for Lockheed's IT businesses - sources,"(Reuters) - Leidos Holdings Inc (LDOS.N) is nearing a deal to merge with the government information technology and services businesses being shed by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) in a deal that could value these assets at around $5 billion, people familiar with the matter said. The deal will create the largest government services provider in the United States, putting Leidos on a stronger footing to cope with lower government spending, increased competition and delays in new contracts. It will also end Lockheed’s reign as the largest provider of IT services to the federal government, leaving the Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier to focus more on sophisticated military hardware. Reston, Virginia-based Leidos submitted an offer earlier this month that prevailed over rival U.S. defense contractor CACI International Inc (CACI.N) and is in the process of finalizing terms with Lockheed, the people said on Tuesday.  Leidos, whose market capitalization is close to $4 billion, plans to merge with the Lockheed businesses for sale under a so-called Reverse Morris Trust, which allows a parent company to divest a unit in a tax-efficient manner, according to the sources.  If the potential agreement is finalized, Leidos and Lockheed Martin could announce a deal as early as next week, the people added. Lockheed is due to announce fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Lockheed and Leidos declined to comment, while CACI did not immediately respond. Leidos shares were up 1.4 percent while Lockheed shares were down 0.8 percent on Tuesday afternoon “This would be a transformational event for Leidos,” said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant. “It would give them enormous scale and have a strong positive impact on operating margins, lifting them up to close to 9 percent.” He said the move would also help Lockheed pay down about $8 billion in debt following its agreement in July to acquire Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), for $9 billion. Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute, said the move would give Leidos unparalleled “heft and reach” in the government services sector. “It will really be in a class by itself,” said Thompson, who has close ties to Lockheed and other weapons makers. “Leidos will define the terms of competition for many lesser competitors.” Another larger player in the market besides CACI is SAIC (SAIC.N), but many smaller companies work in the sector.

691,UTX,Oil drop dims Lockheed unit's commercial helicopter outlook,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) on Tuesday said commercial helicopter sales for its Sikorsky Aircraft unit this year were expected to be about $375 million, half the level projected last summer, due to the sustained drop in world oil prices. “I think the biggest change that we are seeing from when we announced this deal is the changes in sort of the OEM helicopter sales in the commercial marketplace, obviously driven by the oil and gas marketplace as we sit here today,” Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner said in an earnings call. Lockheed expected the unit’s commercial helicopter sales to be about $750 million, down from a 2014 peak of $1.5 billion, when it announced in July plans to buy the maker of Black Hawk helicopters from United Technologies Corp. (UTX.N), Tanner said. The Bethesda, Maryland-based company closed the $9 billion purchase in November. But oil prices last week touched 12-year lows under $30 a barrel before staging a modest rally. Sikorsky sees good prospects for international helicopter sales in areas such as search and rescue and border patrol, which would offset a drop-off in sales to the oil and gas sector. But Tanner said those prospects would not translate into firm orders until after 2016 or 2017, Tanner said. “You should think of that primarily as the transition from development programs where we are seeing lower margins, therefore, lower cash ... to pure production programs that should be sort of normal cash-generating business,” he said.  Tanner added that he expected Sikorsky to be a larger cash generator than under United Technologies because of Lockheed’s ability to negotiate contacts with the government. Lockheed is the Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier.  “We know the game plan, we know the playbook; we just have to sort of execute it with Sikorsky,” he said. Lockheed Martin reported fourth-quarter earnings of $3.01 per share on Tuesday. Analysts had on average expected earnings of $2.94 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

692,UTX,"UPDATE 2-Lockheed seals services deal with Leidos, forecasts profit below view","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) on Tuesday announced a $5 billion tax-free deal to combine its information systems and government services business with Leidos Holdings Inc (LDOS.N), and forecast a lower-than-expected profit in 2016. Lockheed’s shares fell as much as 5 percent amid confusion over future prospects for the Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier, although the stock recovered after Lockheed officials reassured analysts they still expected rising sales and earnings in coming years. Leidos shares dropped as much as 9 percent and were off 7.6 percent at $49.56 in mid afternoon. Lockheed was down 0.8 percent to $209.25.  Leidos, which was split off from Science Applications International Corp (SAIC.N) in 2013, said the combined company would have annual revenues of $10 billion, making it the largest U.S. government services provider. It forecast improved margins and a slight boost in earnings if the deal goes through, and promised shareholders a $1 billion special dividend, or about $13.50 a share. Lockheed would receive a one-time payment of $1.8 billion, and use the money to pay down debt, raise its dividend and possibly buy back shares. It also projected a $1.5 billion gain when the deal is finalized in the third or fourth quarter. Separately, Lockheed reported higher profit and revenues for the fourth quarter and the full year. But the company forecast 2016 earnings of $11.45 to $11.75 per share, below expectations. Despite initial concerns, Rob Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said the Leidos deal appeared to be neutral at worst for Lockheed’s earnings per share. He added that the company was “still on the earnings and cash growth trajectory that we had previously anticipated.” Lockheed said the Leidos deal would lower its share count by 15 million shares through a split-off transaction, offsetting the effect of about $360 million in lost profit that would go to the combined company. Lockheed also said it had a record backlog of $99.6 billion, including $15.6 billion contributed by Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter maker acquired from United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) last year and bode well for future sales growth. Lockheed Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson told analysts the company was not seeing a big pullback in orders from the Middle East or elsewhere due to the sharp drop in oil prices. She said about 21 percent of 2015 revenues came from international sales, and demand remained strong for missile defense equipment, F-35 fighter jets and munitions. But officials said lower oil prices had cut sharply into Sikorsky’s projected commercial helicopter sales.

698,UTX,Airbus A320neo's engine problems to be solved by April: Pratt CEO,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Any technical problems with the engines of Airbus’s (AIR.PA) A320neo jetliner should be solved in the coming weeks, the head of engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) said. “By April, most of that will be solved,” Robert Leduc said at a ceremony at which German flagship carrier Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) took delivery of the first A320neo. Lufthansa stepped up to become the first airline to take delivery of the revamped passenger jet after Qatar Airways voiced uncertainty over the technical performance of its Pratt & Whitney engines. A problem emerged late last year with the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan engine that required extra time for cooling before restarting under some circumstances. Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said on Friday that the German carrier’s engineers were working with Pratt & Whitney to overcome any teething problems as quickly as possible. The A320neo offers 15-percent lower fuel consumption thanks mainly to a choice of next-generation engines from Pratt & Whitney or CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric (GE.N) and France’s Safran (SAF.PA).

699,UTX,Trump would tax Carrier air conditioning units for moving to Mexico,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he would impose taxes on Carrier air conditioning units manufactured in Mexico in light of the company’s decision to move production from Indiana, a position in line with his strong opposition to international trade deals. Video of the company’s announcement last week to employees went viral on the Internet, showing emotional reactions to the loss of jobs while a representative of the company explained the move was “strictly a business decision.” Carrier, a manufacturer of air conditioning units, is owned by United Technologies Corp and announced it would be moving 1,400 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. During Saturday night’s Republican debate, Trump said if he were president, he would approach Carrier officials and give them two choices. “I’m going to tell them, ‘Now I’m going to get consensus from Congress and we’re going to tax you,’” Trump said. “‘So stay where you are [in Mexico] or build in the United States.’ Because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers.” A central part of Trump’s campaign message has been his opposition to international trade pacts that allow products manufactured overseas to be imported with limited or no tariffs. It’s a policy position that reverberates with middle- and low- income Americans, who have watched manufacturing jobs leave the country in the last several decades. Trump cited the video of the workers, which has more than 2.8 million views on YouTube, at the debate.  “If you saw the people, because they have a video of the announcement that Carrier is moving to Mexico, they were laid off,” he said. “They were crying. It was a very sad situation.”  (Reporting by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Bill Trott) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

705,UTX,United Tech says a deal with Honeywell would face major challenges,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) on Monday disclosed merger talks with fellow aerospace component supplier Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) but said a deal would “face insurmountable regulatory obstacles.” A merger could either be blocked outright or conditioned on significant divestitures after a lengthy and disruptive review period that would destroy shareholder value, United Tech said.    Merger discussions between the two U.S.-based multinationals are not currently active, and there have been no recent meetings among lawyers or bankers on any specifics, a source familiar with the matter said. A merger of the two firms would create a behemoth with combined sales of more than $90 billion, a company responsible for a huge amount of equipment on commercial airliners, ranging from jet engines to airplane cockpits and landing gear. Such a deal would likely draw opposition from plane makers such as Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N), as well as the Pentagon, since the companies also make parts for key weapons programs, including Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 program. “If you put these two companies together, they would build the plane from tip to tail,” said a source. “There’s just no way that Boeing and Airbus would ever accept that.” United Tech was reluctant to shed higher-margin commercial aerospace units that would likely be required to secure government approval, another source said. CNBC first reported on the talks earlier on Monday. Honeywell declined to comment on the report. Pentagon officials had no immediate comment.     Jeff Bialos, a law partner with Sutherland Asbill & Brennan and a former senior Pentagon official, said any combination would spark a serious antitrust review given overlapping business in areas ranging from engines to avionics.  “If this were to go forward, it would get significant U.S. government scrutiny,” said Bialos. “This kind of a deal could well result in some kind of material divestiture.” The sources said the government was unlikely to approve a merger of this scale in a presidential election year, which meant the process could likely drag on for 18 to 24 months. Some analysts and antitrust experts said the deal could ultimately be approved if the parties agreed to some big divestitures, since there are other competitors, and if they enlisted the backing of their biggest customers. “We think a merger would unlock significant synergies,” said S&P; Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore in a note to clients.  Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said that the deal would likely win antitrust approval unless there was “a very substantial expression of concern by the airplane manufacturers.” Shares of United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators, closed up 4.6 percent Monday. Shares of Honeywell, a maker of aerospace parts and climate control systems, fell 2 percent. United Technologies and Honeywell first began exploring a merger as early as 1993, but the talks were revived after a broad strategic review initiated by United Tech’s Chief Executive Greg Hayes when he took over last year, according to the sources. That review also resulted in United Technologies selling Sikorsky Aircraft to Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). Hayes put out feelers with Honeywell, but he was snubbed, the people said. In September, after United Technologies’ market capitalization dropped due to poor earnings, Honeywell approached United Technologies with its own offer, which would see it lead the merger instead, the people added.   Despite United Technologies having been offered a premium for its shares, the deal was seen by the company as “dead in the water” with U.S. antitrust officials due to overlapping business in the commercial aerospace and military markets, the people added.  United Technologies grew skeptical of the deal’s prospects with antitrust regulators after reviewing it more closely over the course of the last year, one source close to the company said. United Technologies, which like many multinationals has been hurt by a strong dollar, unveiled a $1.5-billion restructuring plan to cut costs in December, citing slowing growth in China and weakness in Latin America and Europe. Honeywell, which counts Boeing and Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) among its customers, has cut jobs and sold or merged businesses to reduce costs. Both companies have been under pressure by Boeing and Airbus to reduce their costs, and both have also seen defense orders squeezed in recent years.

Some analysts and antitrust experts said the deal could ultimately be approved if the parties agreed to some big divestitures, since there are other competitors, and if they enlisted the backing of their biggest customers. “We think a merger would unlock significant synergies,” said S&P; Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore in a note to clients.  Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said that the deal would likely win antitrust approval unless there was “a very substantial expression of concern by the airplane manufacturers.” Shares of United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators, closed up 4.6 percent Monday. Shares of Honeywell, a maker of aerospace parts and climate control systems, fell 2 percent. United Technologies and Honeywell first began exploring a merger as early as 1993, but the talks were revived after a broad strategic review initiated by United Tech’s Chief Executive Greg Hayes when he took over last year, according to the sources. That review also resulted in United Technologies selling Sikorsky Aircraft to Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). Hayes put out feelers with Honeywell, but he was snubbed, the people said. In September, after United Technologies’ market capitalization dropped due to poor earnings, Honeywell approached United Technologies with its own offer, which would see it lead the merger instead, the people added.   Despite United Technologies having been offered a premium for its shares, the deal was seen by the company as “dead in the water” with U.S. antitrust officials due to overlapping business in the commercial aerospace and military markets, the people added.  United Technologies grew skeptical of the deal’s prospects with antitrust regulators after reviewing it more closely over the course of the last year, one source close to the company said. United Technologies, which like many multinationals has been hurt by a strong dollar, unveiled a $1.5-billion restructuring plan to cut costs in December, citing slowing growth in China and weakness in Latin America and Europe. Honeywell, which counts Boeing and Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) among its customers, has cut jobs and sold or merged businesses to reduce costs. Both companies have been under pressure by Boeing and Airbus to reduce their costs, and both have also seen defense orders squeezed in recent years.

708,UTX,UPDATE 2-Honeywell seeking buyer for building solutions business - WSJ,"(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) is seeking a buyer for its building solutions business, the Wall Street Journal reported, adding that the business could fetch $3 billion to $4 billion. Honeywell has hired Goldman Sachs to help find a buyer for the business, which makes sensing and security technologies for homes and commercial buildings, the Journal said on Wednesday, citing sources. “We do not comment on market rumor or speculation,” Honeywell Vice President External Communications Rob Ferris said. Honeywell’s building solutions and distribution business generated net sales of $4.57 billion in 2015 and accounted for 11.8 percent of the company’s total net sales. Honeywell’s shares were down 0.8 percent at $102.86 in afternoon trading, amid a broad market decline. The news comes a day after Honeywell, a major maker of aerospace components, confirmed it had held deal talks with United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) over the past year. A combination could create a behemoth with combined sales of more than $90 billion. United Tech, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators, said on Monday that a merger could either be blocked outright or be approved only on condition of significant divestitures after a lengthy and disruptive review period that would destroy shareholder value.

711,UTX,Proposed Honeywell-United Tech deal could result in greater pricing power,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc’s (HON.N) proposal to buy rival United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) would create an industrial giant bigger than aircraft makers Boeing Co (BA.N) or Airbus Group (AIR.PA), potentially changing the balance of power between manufacturer and supplier. Pricing power is a key concern of the big aircraft makers, and it is a central issue in the battle between United Technologies and Honeywell. United Technologies on Friday rejected Honeywell’s $90.7 billion offer, citing customer concerns among other big issues. With nearly $100 billion in annual sales and significant combined market share for such key aircraft components as wheels, brakes, power units, ventilation systems, electronics and small engines, a combined Honeywell/United Technologies would have the heft to fight price-cutting demands from customers, industry experts said.  Boeing and Airbus have encouraged small and mid-sized suppliers to merge, so they would have more financial and management depth to serve the plane makers as they ramp up production over the next several years.  That growth requires investments in machines and people that small companies may not be able to support. At the same time, however, the two aircraft makers have pushed suppliers for price cuts, according to industry executives and filings by some suppliers. Honeywell on Friday portrayed a combined Honeywell/United Technologies as a company that would have the resources to hold its own in this environment. Honeywell Chief Executive Dave Cote, in a presentation made to United Technologies on Feb. 19 and made public on Friday, said the two companies together would enjoy “significant commercial opportunities to drive revenue growth.” A heftier research and development budget could fund investment in new technology. And they could boost profit margins by slashing annual costs by $3.5 billion, cutting redundant staffs and purchasing materials at higher volumes, Honeywell said. Boeing and Airbus aren’t waiting for a deal to materialize to express concern about Cote’s vision. Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders said the deal would not be in his company’s interest. Boeing said it would scrutinize the implications, saying in a statement: “Healthy competition in our supply chain is vitally important to Boeing and our commercial and military customers.” The aircraft makers have used leverage afforded by their supply contracts to renegotiate pricing for components under certain conditions, including when a company is sold.  Those negotiations can be protracted and complex, even when a big merger is not at stake. Boeing and another large supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), for example, have been in talks since November 2014 on new contracts governing parts for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and other aircraft, according to regulatory filings and people familiar with the discussions.  While it may be impractical to shift fuselage, wing section and other large components to new suppliers, Boeing can “trim around the edges” by moving smaller parts, said a source familiar with the talks. “And those smaller parts are more profitable.” United Technologies, in a lengthy statement opposing the Honeywell overture, argued that the aircraft makers would see to it that the combined companies had to cut prices by 5 to 10 percent.  United Technologies also said Honeywell’s per share offer of $42.63 in cash and 0.614 Honeywell share “grossly undervalues” the company. Regulators could compel Honeywell and United Technologies to sell some operations to address antitrust issues. United Technologies in its formal response cited the potential for divestitures that would diminish the value of the combined companies.

714,UTX,United Tech keeps to solo path as Honeywell drops bid,"(Reuters) - Aircraft parts maker Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) said Tuesday it scrapped its $90.7 billion offer to buy rival United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), citing the company’s unwillingness to engage in negotiations. The move comes after United Tech rejected Honeywell’s offer last week, saying any synergies from combining the companies would be outweighed by regulatory delays, required divestitures and customer concerns. With another round of Honeywell merger talks behind it, the focus now turns to United Tech’s ability to operate as a stand-alone industrial conglomerate that faces headwinds from multiple sides of its business. “Now the pressure is on for UTC to create shareholder value,” said Jeff Bialos, a law partner with Sutherland Asbill & Brennan and a former senior Pentagon official. Honeywell said it strongly disagreed with United Tech’s characterization of the regulatory and customer risks associated with a deal. “We remain confident that the regulatory process would not have presented a material obstacle to a transaction,” Honeywell said in a statement on Tuesday. Analysts and industry executives said paths that United Tech can pursue to boost its stock include splitting its industrial and aerospace arms or pursuing its own acquisitions. Reuters had reported Friday that United Tech CEO Greg Hayes does not intend to break up the company, but will instead focus on initiatives such as investment in its Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines. Its underperforming Otis elevator division is facing steep engineering and development costs as the company tries to refresh its product line. United Tech makes everything from air conditioners to elevators and fire equipment, to a broad range of aerospace equipment, including tires, cockpits and engines. The company called Honeywell’s decision to drop its pursuit an “appropriate outcome” given the regulatory obstacles and negative customer reaction. “UTC will remain laser focused on our key priorities – program execution, innovation, cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation,” the company said on Tuesday.   Shares of United Tech, the maker of Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, were down 2.8 percent in early trading on Tuesday, while Honeywell was up 3.2 percent. A combination of the two would create a company with nearly $100 billion in revenue, responsible for a huge amount of equipment on commercial airliners, ranging from jet engines to cockpits and landing gear. Major customers Airbus Group (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N) weighed in last week, saying they did not support such a deal.  A merger would also have drawn scrutiny from the Pentagon, since the companies make parts for key weapons programs, including Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 program.

720,UTX,UPDATE 1-U.S. Air Force says Pratt to build engines for new bomber,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force on Monday named Pratt & Whitney as the engine maker for the new Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) long-range strike bomber, and defended the plane’s “cost plus incentive fee” contract that has been challenged by U.S. lawmakers. U.S. Air Force Secretary Deborah James revealed the names of the engine maker, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and other key suppliers at a Pentagon news conference amid growing calls for more transparency about the classified arms program. Other key suppliers for the new B-21 bomber include the U.S. units of two British suppliers, BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L) and GKN Plc (GKN.L), as well as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), Orbital ATK Inc (OA.N), Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) and Janicki Industries, a family-owned company, James said. Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) last month dropped their challenge to the multibillion-dollar bomber contract that Northrop won in October. James said the suppliers named Monday would work on the airframe and mission systems of the new flying wing stealth bomber, but gave no details. Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch, the Air Force’s top military acquisition official, declined to say where Northrop would assemble the planes. He said the Air Force hoped in time to provide the value of the bomber development contract and associated incentive fees. He said the incentive fees were based on cost and performance, with an emphasis on meeting plans to start using the new planes in combat from the mid 2020s. The Air Force initially estimated it would cost $23.5 billion to develop the new bomber, but has not released terms of its contract with Northrop. Analysts have said the overall deal could be worth $80 billion to Northrop and its suppliers over time. James said the Air Force was working to address questions raised by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain about the Northrop contract. McCain fears it could leave the U.S. government liable for potential cost increases. She said it would take “money and time” to cancel and redo the deal if McCain succeeds in blocking it. McCain says the Air Force has been spared from $1 billion in cost overruns on a new refueling plane being built by Boeing since that plane was developed under a fixed price contract. But Bunch said this program was different since it involved a wholly new airplane, and the company had no potential commercial or foreign military sales customers to help defray its costs.

721,UTX,UPDATE 3-United Tech looks for a big deal after rebuffing Honeywell,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), maker of jet engines, aircraft components and building systems, said it is open to doing a large acquisition despite rejecting a merger proposed by Honeywell International Inc (HON.N). “I wouldn’t be afraid to do a big deal,” Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said at an investor meeting on Thursday. But “it’s got to be something that’s actionable ... and the regulatory hurdles have to be manageable.” Hayes said there was appetite in UTC’s commercial businesses, including elevators, fire and security systems, and possibly its aerospace systems business, to make a sizable acquisition. UTC recently scotched an approach by Honeywell because the deal faced “very real” obstacles from regulators and customers, Hayes said. Without an acquisition, the company is poised for “huge growth” based in part on urbanization and rising disposable incomes in the developing world, he said. “We don’t need M&A; for growth,” Hayes said, noting the company was not looking to increase debt for a short-term stock gain. Asked if the company was concerned about pressure from activist investors following the Honeywell approach, Hayes pointed to two board appointments the company made in December: T. Rowe Price Group Inc Chairman Brian Rogers and Frederic Reynolds, former Chief Financial Officer of CBS.  “We brought these guys on because we needed the voice of the investor on the board,” Hayes said. UTC forecast compounded annual revenue growth of 5 percent to 8 percent through the end of the decade. Its Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine division is poised for revenue growth in excess of 10 percent a year over that period. The investment in aerospace systems and Pratt has positioned those units for “nearly a trillion dollars in future business over next 25 years,” Hayes said, referring to sales. Pratt engines, both those already in service and those already sold, will account for $750 billion of the total, he said. The Otis elevator unit is aiming to boost growth, after recent years when efforts to widen profit margins cost it market share.  The company said it cut its forecast for heating, ventilation and air conditioning sales this year to low single-digit growth from mid single-digit growth, mainly due to slow sales in the Middle East. “The work there has come to pretty much of a halt due to what’s going on in the oil industry,” said Bob McDonough, president of the Climate, Controls and Security business.

726,UTX,UPDATE 2-Lockheed CEO still likes Sikorsky despite slumping sales to energy sector,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) has “no regrets” about buying Sikorsky for $9 billion even though sliding oil prices have taken a bigger bite than expected from the company’s commercial helicopter sales, Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said Tuesday. Hewson told reporters at the company’s annual media day that buying Sikorsky from United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) was “absolutely a great opportunity” and Lockheed remained confident about its long-term prospects, despite the drop in commercial sales as energy companies have slashed spending. She said she expected oil prices to recover over the longer term. Lockheed closed its $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky from United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) in November. Sharp declines in oil revenues have resulted in bigger than expected declines in Sikorsky’s commercial helicopter revenues, prompting some analysts and industry executives to say Lockheed likely overpaid for the storied Black Hawk makers. Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner rejected speculation that Lockheed had paid 20 times Sikorsky’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and said that was an “overstated number.” He told Reuters in an interview that Lockheed remained upbeat about Sikorsky’s longer-term prospects, and said its cash generation would also increase as it moved ahead on several U.S. military development programs, including a new presidential helicopter program. “We did not buy this business for the next three years; we bought it for the next three decades,” Tanner said. Dale Bennett, who heads Lockheed’s Mission Systems and Training business that now includes Sikorsky, said the unit’s margins were on par with what Lockheed was used to, and its revenues and cash generation would improve in coming years. “There’s absolutely no buyer’s remorse,” Bennett told Reuters in an interview at the company’s annual media day. “It’s (just) going to look a little depressed for the first couple of years as we absorb the amortization and the integration costs.” Lockheed officials said they were optimistic about foreign sales prospects for CH-53K heavy lift helicopters and H-60 Black Hawk helicopters built by its new Sikorsky unit, which would help offset the slump in commercial orders.

739,UTX,Honeywell won't rule out aerospace M&A; targets,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) would not rule out bidding for another major aerospace supplier, among other possible acquisition targets, after merger talks collapsed in March with rival United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), the company’s chief executive said on Monday.  CEO David Cote said in an interview that Honeywell has around 100 potential acquisition targets in the pipeline at any time that he regularly reviews, but stressed that he was not in a rush to make an acquisition. “I’ve got a pretty rigorous process for this,” he said on the sidelines of the International Economic Forum of the Americas conference in Montreal.  “When it comes to M&A; for us we still have a lot of money, which is a nice position to be in,” he said.  “If we can’t (do a good deal), I’m not going to get hung up on ‘I have to deploy the money’.” In March, Honeywell scrapped a $90.7 billion offer to buy United Technologies in a merger that would have created a behemoth with combined sales of almost $100 billion, citing UTC’s unwillingness to engage in negotiations. Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA), a major customer of both Honeywell and UTC, expressed concern that the merger would not be in its interests. Cote, 64, said the failed talks with UTC would not dissuade him from considering other aerospace companies. His greater concern is being disciplined on price.  “If you overpay, you’re dead,” he said.

744,UTX,UPDATE 2-Lockheed Martin raises forecast as quarterly sales beat,"(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the Pentagon’s No. 1 weapons supplier, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and lifted its 2016 revenue and profit forecasts for the second time, buoyed by increased deliveries of its F-35 fighter jets. The company’s shares — already up 18 percent this year — soared to a record high of $261.37 in early trading on Tuesday. The results from the world’s largest defense contractor is often seen as a bellwether for the U.S. defense sector. Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and Raytheon Co (RTN.N) are due to report quarterly results next week. Lockheed is also benefiting from its $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft last year from United Technologies Corp (UTX.N). Lockheed raised its 2016 profit forecast to $12.15–$12.45 per share from $11.50-$11.80.   The company also said it now expected full-year sales of $50.0 billion-$51.5 billion, up from $49.6 billion-$51.1 billion it previously estimated.  Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $11.84 per share and revenue of $50.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lockheed said sales in its aeronautics business, the company’s biggest, rose 6 percent in the three months ended June 26 as it delivered 14 F-35 jets, compared with 11 a year earlier.  The company has said it plans to deliver 53 F-35 jets in 2016, up from 45 a year earlier. “(The) consensus expectations are finally positive for the F-35 and for improvement in the defense budget, which has led to a higher valuation,” Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned wrote in a note. The F-35 is the Pentagon’s costliest arms program. The U.S. Defense Department expects to spend $379 billion to develop the plane and buy 2,457 of the supersonic, stealthy new warplanes, in the coming decades. The company’s net income rose to $1.02 billion, or $3.32 per share, from $929 million, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier. Excluding income tax benefits of $11 million, Lockheed earned $3.28 per share.  Net sales rose to $12.91 billion from $11.64 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.93 per share and revenue $12.55 billion.

756,UTX,United Technologies will retrain Carrier workers: CEO,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) plans retrain U.S. workers at its Carrier Corp air conditioning unit who will lose their jobs once production moves to Mexico, the company’s top executive said on Tuesday. “These are real people with real jobs and real lives,” United Technologies Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said at a conference in Chicago on future technologies. “We do have a responsibility to those workers.” He gave no details about what the retraining would entail.

Doug Cai, president of Greater China, Pratt & Whitney, told a news conference on the sidelines of the country’s biggest air expo in Zhuhai that Air China had picked V2500 engines for 18 of its A320 aircraft, while Shenzhen Airlines selected the engine for 13 of its jets.

772,UTX,Sanders to Trump: use defense contracts as leverage for Carrier jobs,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders turned up the pressure on President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday about his pledge to try to stop an Indiana air conditioner manufacturer from moving 1,400 jobs to Mexico. Both Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, and Trump seized on an announcement earlier this year by United Technologies Corp’s Carrier division that it would shift production to Mexico as an example of how trade deals hurt U.S. workers. Sanders on Saturday warned “it is not good enough to save some of these jobs” and said Trump should use as leverage United Technologies’ defense contracts, Export-Import Bank financing, and tax breaks. “I call on Mr. Trump to make it clear to the CEO of United Technologies that if his firm wants to receive another defense contract from the taxpayers of this country, it must not move these plants to Mexico,” the senator from Vermont said in a statement. A representative for Carrier declined to comment on Sanders’ statement. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, said on Thursday that he was “working hard, even on Thanksgiving” to get the plant to stay and said he was “making progress” on the issue. Carrier Corp. confirmed it had “discussions with the incoming administration.” Neither side has provided details. Trump had threatened to slap taxes on the company’s air conditioners made in Mexico and shipped back to the United States. A spokesman was not immediately available for comment on Sanders’ statement on Saturday. Sanders said he would soon introduce legislation that would prevent companies that outsource from receiving federal contracts, grants and loans, and force companies that outsource jobs to pay a penalty tax and pay back tax breaks.

773,UTX,"UPDATE 3-Carrier to keep about 1,000 U.S. factory jobs in deal with Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) has reached a deal with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs at its Carrier Corp air conditioner plant in Indianapolis, roughly halving the number of U.S. jobs it planned to move to Mexico. The deal, announced by Carrier on Twitter late on Tuesday, is a victory for Trump, who campaigned hard on keeping jobs in the United States and specifically criticized Carrier for shipping jobs overseas, messages which appealed to blue-collar workers in the Midwest. “I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to make a major announcement concerning Carrier A.C. staying in Indianapolis,” Trump tweeted late on Tuesday. “Great deal for workers!” Company officials, Trump and Pence, who is the governor of Indiana, will announce some of the deal’s terms on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Indiana state officials were involved in the talks, but it was unclear what, if any, inducements the state may have made to encourage Carrier to keep the jobs in the United States. Carrier’s parent, United Technologies, has a strong incentive to keep good relations with Trump and his incoming administration, given that a portion of its estimated $57 billion revenue this year will come through U.S. military contracts at its Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems units. Carrier announced plans in February to close an air conditioner factory in Indianapolis with the loss of 1,400 jobs. It said a further 700 jobs would be cut from another plant in Huntington, Indiana, northeast of Indianapolis. The company planned to move the jobs to Monterrey, Mexico, starting in 2017. Local union leaders said Carrier told them it would pay Mexican workers $3 an hour compared with more than $20 for their U.S. counterparts. The announcement prompted attacks from Trump during his campaign, and he vowed to impose hefty taxes on imported Carrier products if it did not reverse the move. He predicted in February the company would call him to say “Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana,” and promised the chances of the plant staying open was “100 percent.” As recently as 10 days ago, Carrier insisted it had no plans to reverse course, but then acknowledged on the Thanksgiving Day holiday on Nov. 24 that it was in talks with the Trump transition team. Trump has promised to keep U.S. jobs from moving overseas by renegotiating or withdrawing from trade agreements and imposing tariffs on foreign-made goods. But it is not clear he can reverse broader trends that have led to the loss of more than 5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs since 2000.  Democratic Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly praised the announcement by Carrier to keep jobs in the state, but said “there are at least two other companies currently planning to move Hoosier (Indiana) jobs out of the country. We need to change our laws to encourage companies to grow here at home.” Carrier is just one of many U.S. manufacturers moving jobs to Mexico. However, videos of a company official delivering the news to the Indianapolis plant’s stunned workforce, posted on YouTube, provided a vivid look at the pain and anger such decisions cause. Earlier this month, Ford Motor Co (F.N) made a decision to keep production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle in Kentucky, which Trump claimed as a victory for keeping the plant in the United States, even though Ford never had plans to move the entire factory to Mexico.

777,UTX,UTC CEO says no 'quid pro quo' on keeping Indiana plant open,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), parent company of Carrier Corp, got a “good deal” with President-elect Donald Trump that allowed it to shift most jobs at two Indiana plants to Mexico, its chief executive said on Monday in an interview with CNBC. Greg Hayes, chief executive of UTC, said Trump did not make threats in negotiations over the plant’s future or raise the company’s U.S. military contracts.  Carrier, which in February had announced plans to close two Indiana plants and send 2,100 jobs to Mexico, agreed last week to keep its Indianapolis plant open and keep about 1,100 jobs in the state, including 800 at the plant. It did not change its decision to close its Huntington plant. “I was born at night but not last night,” Hayes told CNBC. “I also know that about 10 percent of our revenue comes from the U.S. government. And I know that a better regulatory environment, a lower tax rate can eventually help UTC over the long run. And so we weighed all of things in making the decision with the board.” UTC, which had revenue of $56 billion in 2015 and owns Pratt & Whitney, has significant U.S. military contracts. Trump, who repeatedly threatened during the presidential campaign to impose a 35 percent tax on companies that moved jobs overseas, announced a deal last week in which UTC agreed to keep the Indianapolis plant open and invest at least $16 million in it. Indiana officials said UTC would receive up to $7 million in state tax incentives. “We keep the plant open, we keep 1,100 people employed in Indianapolis. We still get to do the preponderance of the restructuring, which we were going to do anyways,” Hayes told CNBC, calling it a “a good deal for UTC.” Hayes said there was “no quid pro quo” and said Trump did not tell him he would not impose taxes if the plant was kept open. “He simply said, ‘Take a hard look at it,’” Hayes said. Hayes said the $16 million investment will help automate the plant “to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive. Now is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower cost labor? No.” Hayes said the company’s military contracts did not come up in talks with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the Indiana governor. Wayne Ranick, a spokesman for the United Steelworkers union, said the deal means that 730 union workers at the Indianapolis plant will keep their jobs and about 80 salaried workers. But work on fan coil manufacturing “is still going to Mexico, affecting about 600 employees.” The nearly 1,100 jobs also includes retaining about 300 jobs at Carrier’s Indiana headquarters that were not scheduled to go Mexico.

The new Pratt & Whitney engine, which powers Airbus Group (AIR.PA), Bombardier Inc (AIR.PA), Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA) and other jetliners, represents a major investment for United Tech, which also makes Carrier air conditioners and Otis elevators.

Despite the problems, the company said it expected to deliver 350 to 400 of the engines this year, including about 50 spares. United Tech also said it still expected 2017 earnings of $6.30 to $6.60 per share, excluding special items, on sales of $57.5 billion to $59.0 billion, forecasts it had first set in December. “Our growing aerospace backlog and strategic investments in the commercial businesses position us well to generate higher organic growth in 2017,” Hayes said in a statement.

783,UTX,UPDATE 1-Lockheed F-35 jet cost could drop 16 percent -Pentagon official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The cost of Lockheed Martin Corp’s stealthy F-35 jet could fall 16 percent to around $80 million in future purchases, according to the Department of Defense’s head of the program. In February, the Pentagon agreed to a deal for the tenth batch of the fighter aircraft at below $95 million per jet for the first time, compared with $102 million in the previous purchase and the lowest price ever. Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 program for the Pentagon, gave his new estimate for the future cost of the jet while speaking to the U.S House of Representatives at a Capitol Hill hearing on Thursday. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the Pentagon’s most expensive program for delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has steadily declined in recent years as production ramps up. Bogdan said in his testimony to Congress that he has spoken to Trump several times about the cost of the stealth aircraft. Lockheed and its main partners have been developing and building F-35s for the U.S. military and 10 allies. The F-35 comes in three configurations, the A-model for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. allies; the B-model, which can handle short take-offs and vertical landings for the Marine Corps and the British navy; and the carrier-variant F-35C jets. Lockheed, the prime contractor, and its partners, including Northrop Grumman Corp, United Technologies Corp’s Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc, have been working on building a more cost-effective supply chain to fuel the production line in Fort Worth, Texas. The U.S. Defense Department expects to spend $391 billion over many years to develop and buy 2,443 of the supersonic warplanes.

790,UTX,"Pentagon seeks at least 5 pct savings on Lockheed F-35 jet, sources","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin Corp could shave at least 5 percent off the price of stealthy F-35 fighter jets in their upcoming annual purchase contract as the standard version of the plane heads toward a price of below $80 million, people familiar with the talks told Reuters. The Pentagon, under the direction of Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, has been exploring how to cut the costs of its most expensive weapons program. The deal for last year’s annual purchase contract, struck this February, put the standard takeoff and landing version of the jet at the lowest price ever, $94.6 million, a 7.3 percent reduction from the previous annual purchase price of $102 million. The current negotiations are for a batch of about 130 planes. The talks could shave 5-7 percent, or $660 million, from the approximately 100 standard takeoff and landing “A-model” jets for the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. allies, the people said. The F-35 comes in three configurations: the A-model; the B-model, which can handle short take-offs and vertical landings for the Marine Corps and the British navy; and the carrier-variant F-35C jets. The number and type of jets in the deal as well as the timing for an agreement have not been finalized, the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private. The Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office said it remains focused on getting the best deal for the planes and for taxpayers, but would not comment on the negotiations. A Lockheed Martin representative declined to comment. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the F-35 program for delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has steadily declined in recent years as production increases. Speaking at a conference last month, Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, head of the F-35 program for the Pentagon, said the government hoped that by 2020 the F-35 would cost less than $80 million, a 16 percent drop from its current price. Lockheed, the prime contractor for the jet, and its partners including Northrop Grumman Corp, United Technologies Corp’s Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc, have been working to lower costs by building a more cost-effective supply chain for the production line in Fort Worth, Texas.

792,UTX,United Tech engine deliveries not changed by JetBlue deferral: CFO,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp still plans to deliver 350 to 400 Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan engines to plane makers this year, and does not expect the total to be reduced by JetBlue’s decision to defer some Airbus aircraft with those engines, United Tech’s chief financial officer told Reuters on Wednesday. JetBlue Airways Corp raised concerns on Tuesday when it said it will postpone delivery of 13 aircraft scheduled for 2019 and 2020 and take Airbus planes with an earlier engine design. “All they have done is swapped some engines,” CFO Akhil Johri said in an interview. Johri said that since European regulators have recently approved a solution, repairs can go ahead, and engines already sent to customers should be fixed by the middle to the end of May. The fix also was going into engines in production. “It will take some time before all the drama dies,” he said. “But these are durability issues we know how to fix.” A second problem with the engine combustor lining degrading sooner than expected will be fixed by year-end, and “all the new engines after that will have the longer durability on the combustor liner,” he said. On a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes said the costs of the repairs were “not huge” and had been factored into earnings projections for the year. “It’s not material,” he said. Hayes added, “We haven’t seen any other surprises or concerns” with the engines.” United Tech, the maker of Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners and aerospace parts, reported a 17.8 percent rise in profit on Wednesday, beating analysts expectations.

798,UTX,Investors expect AT&T; to hit debt market,"LONDON, May 2 (IFR) - AT&T; is expected to tap the European bond market soon to help finance its US$85.4bn acquisition of Time Warner, according to several market participants. AT&T; is holding European meetings for a ‘non-deal’ investor update from May 2 via Bank of America Merrill Lynch and BNP Paribas. Those banks said the meetings will only be used to update investors and are not linked to new bond issuance. However, market participants are already speculating that AT&T; is getting the ball rolling for a jumbo transaction, expected to be a mix of euro and US dollar debt. “Everyone is eyeing up the US$30bn bridge and assuming they’ll address some of that in euros,” said one investor due to meet with the company later today. Another investor that met with AT&T; earlier on Tuesday told IFR that he expected to see a deal in the near term. “Reading into it, yes, they will start to refinance that US$30bn shortly in the bond market.” The wireless giant announced that it had agreed to buy Time Warner Inc in October last year, and said it would finance the cash portion of the acquisition with debt and cash on its balance sheet. AT&T; has an 18-month bridge loan for US$30bn maturing in May 2018, according to Thomson Reuters data. Companies have typically taken out bridge loans with bonds soon after announcing acquisitions in recent years due to strong market conditions and ultra low interest rates. “If the world is still spinning in two/three weeks then we’ll see a euro bond from AT&T;,” a banker not involved in the meetings said. “AT&T; typically don’t like doing bond roadshows and they were put off by Honeywell and United Technologies, who saw spreads widen massively after holding roadshows last year.” AT&T; was last in the European market in February 2015 with a €2.5bn dual-tranche deal. The €1.25bn Sep 2023 portion was bid at 59bp over mid-swaps on Tuesday, according to Tradeweb, having priced at plus 75bp. The company is rated Baa1/BBB+/A- by Moody’s/S&P;/Fitch (all on negative watch). The Time Warner acquisition was approved by the European Commission in March. “It’s moving along as expected. The European Commission has approved it. The Department of Justice is now reviewing it, and we’re working closely with them to answer any questions that they may have,” Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T;’s chairman, CEO and President said on the company’s earnings call in April.

799,UTX,"UPDATE 2-China, Russia set up wide-body jet firm in new challenge to Boeing, Airbus","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China and Russia on Monday completed the formal registration of a joint venture to build a wide-body jet, kick-starting full-scale development of a program aimed at competing with market leaders Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus SE (AIR.PA). State plane makers Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] and Russia’s United Aircraft Corp (UAC) said at a ceremony in Shanghai the venture would aim to build a “competitive long range wide-body commercial aircraft”. The announcement comes just weeks after COMAC successfully completed the maiden flight of its C919, China’s first home-grown narrow-body passenger jet. COMAC President Jin Zhuanglong said the two firms had decided to hold the establishment ceremony after the C919’s flight. “This program is aimed at fulfilling future market demand,” he told reporters. “Our two countries, our two firms ... have created this joint venture to undertake responsibilities such as organization, research, management and implementation.” The program will have a research center in Moscow and assembly line in Shanghai, he said, adding division of labor was still being discussed.  Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC’s wide-body department, said the venture would ask suppliers to bid for the contract to build the engine by year-end. COMAC and UAC first announced the program in 2014. In November, they said they had set up a joint venture in Shanghai and unveiled a mock-up of the basic version of the jet that would have a range of up to 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) and seat 280 passengers. UAC President Yuri Slyusar said the firms looked to complete the maiden flight and first delivery during 2025-2028, and aimed to take 10 percent of a market dominated by the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. Previously, they targeted a maiden flight in 2022 and delivery in or after 2025.  UAC is also developing a version of Russian wide-body jet Ilyushin IL-96. Slyusar said the two programmes had different requirements, and that UAC would use experience with the IL-96 to aid development of the Chinese-Russian jet. UAC and COMAC hold equal shares in their venture, whose jet they said would be 10-15 percent cheaper to run than planes from Boeing and Airbus. Last July, Boeing forecast airlines worldwide would need 9,100 wide-body planes over 20 years through 2035, with a wave of replacement demand around 2021-2028. Over the past decade, China has plowed billions of dollars into domestic jet development to raise its profile in global aviation and boost high-tech manufacturing.

802,UTX,UPDATE 2-F-35 jets grounded at U.S. Air Force base in Arizona -officials,"(Reuters) - The stealthy F-35 fighter jets made by Lockheed Martin Corp were temporarily grounded at a U.S. Air Force base in Arizona on Friday because of irregularities in pilots’ oxygen supplies, an Air Force spokesman said. Training flights were scheduled to resume on Monday after a day of safety briefings at the base on Friday, a base spokeswoman said.  Lockheed Martin plans to demonstrate the advanced jet at the Paris Air Show this month. At Luke Air Force Base northwest of Phoenix, Arizona, the 56th Fighter Wing canceled local flying operations for its F-35A Lightning II aircraft due to five incidents in which pilots experienced symptoms resembling hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, according to the Air Force spokesman, Captain Mark Graff at the Pentagon. The Air Force said the incidents occurred from May 2 to Thursday, and that in each case the aircraft’s backup oxygen system worked as designed and the jets were able to land safely. The base typically has 25 training flights each weekday, the base spokeswoman said. The Pentagon said that it was conducting a comprehensive review of the facts and circumstances surrounding physiological episodes along with industry experts. A Lockheed representative said the company would help the Air Force address the issue. The F-35 business accounted for about 37 percent of Lockheed’s total revenue during the last fiscal quarter, which ended on March 30. During the quarter, Lockheed’s revenue from its aeronautics business increased 8 percent to $4.11 billion, led by higher sales of the F-35.  Lockheed and its main partners, Northrop Grumman Corp, United Technologies Corp’s Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc have been developing and building F-35s for the U.S. military and 10 allies.

Training flights at Arizona’s Luke Air Force Base, where the 55 jets are based, were canceled on Friday and scheduled to resume on Monday, but the grounding was extended indefinitely. More than 220 F-35s are flying worldwide. The grounding comes at a critical time for Lockheed, which plans to demonstrate the advanced jet at the Paris Air Show next week. F-35 air operations at other bases continued, U.S. Air Force officials said. The F-35 business accounts for about 37 percent of Lockheed’s total revenue. During the first quarter, Lockheed’s revenue from its aeronautics business increased 8 percent to $4.11 billion, led by higher sales of the F-35. Luke Air Force Base, located northwest of Phoenix, is home to the 56th Fighter Wing. The base canceled local flying operations for its F-35A Lightning II aircraft due to five incidents in which pilots experienced symptoms resembling hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, Graff said on Friday at the Pentagon. The Air Force said the incidents occurred from May 2 to Thursday, and that in each case the aircraft’s backup oxygen system worked as designed and the jets were able to land safely. The base’s F-35A Lightning II’s typically fly 25 training missions each weekday, base officials said. The halt in flights at Luke Air Force Base was extended so the Air Force could study the issue with pilots, maintenance workers and medical professionals, said Major Rebecca Heyse, a base spokeswoman. Luke is the largest F-35 base in the world and trains U.S. pilots as well as those of allied countries.  A Lockheed representative said the company would help the Air Force address the issue. Lockheed and its main partners, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L), have been developing and building F-35s for the U.S. military and 10 allies. The 220 F-35s around the world have collectively flown more than 95,000 flight hours, though the plane has not yet seen combat.

806,UTX,Russia's UAC targets sales of more than 600 long-range planes,"PARIS (Reuters) - Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said on Tuesday it hoped a long-range, widebody plane it is developing with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) would sell more than 600 over a 20-year period. The jet represents a Russian and Chinese effort to compete in the lucrative widebody segment that is now divided between Europe’s Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing. The maiden flight for the venture’s new plane is scheduled for 2023, with first delivery expected two years later. “We have big expectations with COMAC for this product,” UAC President Yury Slyusar said at the Paris Airshow, adding that he was hopeful about selling more than 600 of the planes over 20 years. UAC was established by a 2006 presidential decree that consolidated Russia’s aviation assets and aimed to revive the fortunes of the nation’s plane business. It owns Russian brands such as Tupolev, Ilyushin and MiG, as well as Sukhoi’s commercial Superjet program. Slyusar also called for the lifting of Western sanctions from Russia. “We are interested in eliminating, cancelling any sanctions, it would be very useful in the future,” he said in later comments to Reuters. The measures were imposed by the European Union and the United States after Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014. A Russian official earlier said Russian industry had adapted to sanctions by, for instance, building an indigenous capacity to produce parts that had previously come from European firms.

812,UTX,"United Tech sales up 2.7 percent amid engine issues, weak markets","(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), maker of Otis Elevators, Pratt & Whitney engines and Carrier air conditioners, on Tuesday reported a 2.7 percent rise in quarterly revenue, helped by higher sales in three of its four business units. The organic revenue growth, which excludes foreign exchange and acquisitions, prompted the company to raise its forecast for full-year sales. It also lifted the low end of its range for adjusted earnings. But the company reported narrowing profit margins and slowing sales in some regions as it tries to sell elevators amid tough economic conditions in China and increases production of the Geared Turbofan aircraft engines. Engine losses are expected to peak next year, Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes said on a conference call. Engine makers typically lose money on their initial production until they reduce costs. The company plans to reduce factory space and flatten its organizational structure to cuts costs this year and next, Hayes said. Moves by Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA) to capture more of the market for airplane parts and service could prompt United Technologies to raise prices for those parts, he said. Boeing has launched a services unit that aims to capture $50 billion in profitable aftermarket sales, a market currently served mostly by suppliers. United Technology shares were down 2.5 percent to $120.08. United Technologies beat expectations for quarterly revenue and profit in the latest quarter, and said it had solved a supply chain problem with the Geared Turbofan engines that had caused Airbus to delay deliveries of the new A320neo aircraft. Pratt retested some engines in the second quarter, but still plans to deliver 350 to 400 this year. “It did cause a problem to Airbus, no doubt,” Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri said in an interview. Now, however, “our production issues are pretty much in control.” A person familiar with Airbus production plans indicated that problems persisted. “We know what the fix is, but the time it takes to put it in place keeps unraveling,” the source said. “A wave of airplanes keeps getting pushed back each month, which makes it harder to eat into the earlier delays,” he added. Another industry source said some airlines were refusing to take delivery of Airbus A320neo aircraft because not enough spare engines were being made available.  Airbus declined to comment. Pratt built 145 engines in the first half, seven more than in all of last year, and delivered 134. Net income rose to $1.44 billion, or $1.80 per share, in the quarter, from $1.43 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings rose to $1.85 per share, up from $1.82. Analysts expected $1.78, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose to $15.28 billion from $14.87 billion.

818,UTX,United Technologies in bid to acquire Rockwell Collins: source,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), the U.S. maker of Otis Elevators and Carrier air conditioners, has submitted an offer to acquire aircraft component manufacturer Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N), a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. By acquiring Rockwell Collins, which has a market capitalization of $19.3 billion, United Technologies would bulk up its aerospace group, giving it the option of separating it from the company’s other industrial units. Rockwell Collins has been working with an investment bank to review United Technologies’ offer, and there is no certainty that it will decide to engage in any further negotiations with United Technologies, the source said. The source asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Rockwell Collins and United Technologies declined to comment.  Bloomberg News reported earlier on Friday that United Technologies was “weighing” a potential acquisition of Rockwell Collins, but said it was unclear whether the two companies were currently in talks. A combination of the two large aerospace suppliers would meld Rockwell’s commercial and military aircraft avionics business with United Technologies’ broad portfolio that includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems and other electronic and mechanical devices used in aviation.  United Technologies’ Pratt & Whitney engine unit has had production problems with its new Geared Turbofan engine, prompting delays of new Airbus (AIR.PA) A320neo aircraft. United Technologies also has noted weakness in demand for Otis elevators, particularly in China, which has weighed on results. In April, Rockwell acquired B/E Aerospace, a maker of aircraft seats, lavatories and galleys, a deal that broadened its product lines but drew questions from analysts and investors who saw little logic in combining the two businesses. Rockwell expanded its avionics business with a deal to provide aircraft data networking services, known as FOMAX, for all new Airbus A320 aircraft starting in 2018.

822,UTX,UPDATE 1-Veritas Capital explores sale of nearly $3 bln in high-tech portfolio assets -sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York-based private equity firm Veritas Capital is exploring the sale of two high-tech portfolio companies, worth nearly $3 billion in total, as it looks to raise cash to fund new deals this Fall, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The potential sales of electronics component maker Excelitas Technologies Corp and radar component-maker Anaren Inc would be a major boost for the U.S. aerospace and defense-related M&A; landscape, which has seen just $1 billion worth of deals so far this year - a 46 percent drop on the same period in 2016.   Veritas has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc to pursue a so-called dual track sale process for Excelitas which could see the Massachusetts-based company sold outright or floated via an initial public offering, the people said. If successful, Excelitas could fetch as much as $2 billion, they added. The private equity firm, which has investments in several national security and tech-sector assets, has also hired bankers to offload Anaren in a separate deal that could be worth more than $800 million, the same people told Reuters. Spokespeople for Veritas and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Excelitas and Anaren did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks. Excelitas makes products such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and flash lamps which are used in applications ranging from medical lighting to aerospace and defense equipment. Anaren produces microwave components for wireless, space and defense electronics providers and counts Raytheon Co, Lockheed Martin Corp., and Northrop Grumman Corp as customers. The New York-based company’s microwave assemblies are used in the United States’ Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), the system the U.S. military is developing to track intercontinental ballistic missiles launched from places like North Korea. Deals in the aerospace and defense industry have slowed this year after the election of President Donald Trump sent asset prices soaring, making many buyers hold off on deals.  Bucking the trend is a potential $20-plus billion mega-deal between two aircraft parts-makers United Technologies Corp and Rockwell Collins Inc, first reported on 4 August. The barren landscape could be could be good for Veritas, with many cash-rich buyers on the scout for assets, but the sensitive nature of the technology involved is also expected to invite intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny, bankers said.  Veritas created Excelitas by acquiring the former illumination and detection solutions business of scientific instruments maker PerkinElmer Inc. for about $500 million in 2010. Excelitas went on to acquire more companies, including Kaiser Systems Inc, a manufacturer of high-voltage power systems, and Qioptiq, a maker of specialized optical components and lenses. Veritas had previously attempted to sell Excelitas in 2014, Reuters reported at the time, but no deal was reached. In 2014, Veritas paid $383 million to take Anaren private, delisting it from the NASDAQ stock exchange. Both sales are in their early stages and could be called off at any time, the people said.

827,UTX,UPDATE 1-Airbus hopes M&A; talk does not distract United Tech from operations,"(Adds details about Boeing; adds NEW YORK dateline) By Ingrid Melander and Alwyn Scott PARIS/NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Airbus has urged supplier United Technologies Corp to stay focused on fixing industrial problems that have delayed new aircraft deliveries even if it presses ahead with plans to buy avionics and seats maker Rockwell Collins Inc. The two U.S. aerospace suppliers have been discussing a tie-up for around a month and a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday a deal could come as early as next week. “We will only comment on the implications of such a deal when it becomes real,” an Airbus spokesman said. “Today, our total focus is on delivering planes and we hope that any potential M&A; would not distract UTC from their top operational priority.” Delays in receiving engines from United Technologies subsidiary Pratt & Whitney have disrupted deliveries of Airbus A320neo jets, drawing criticism from the European planemaker’s management. United Technologies said in July that the problems will be fixed by year-end and that it still expects to deliver between 350 and 400 engines this year. The unusual warning to United Technologies before any acquisition is completed is the first public sign that the possible deal to create a large, combined supplier may be ringing alarms at the world’s largest planemakers. United Technologies and Rockwell Collins declined to comment on the remarks from the Airbus spokesman. Boeing Co declined to comment on the potential impact of a merger between the two suppliers. Boeing does not use Pratt engines, but its aircraft have major parts and systems made by United Technologies and Rockwell, such as avionics, seats and air conditioning. In the past, Boeing has raised concerns about mergers among suppliers in cases where a combination could lead to higher prices or cause production problems. In some cases, Boeing has used its power in reassigning supply contracts to new owners to oppose deals, but those were typically with much smaller suppliers than Rockwell or United Technologies. Rockwell Collins shares fell after Boeing said in July that it had set up an avionics group to make aircraft controls and electronics, a move seen as potentially threatening to Rockwell Collins and United Technologies.

828,UTX,Breakingviews - United Technologies’ avionics bid looks airworthy," NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - United Technologies’ avionics bid looks airworthy. The conglomerate’s potential acquisition of Rockwell Collins should deliver enough cost savings to justify paying a reported price tag of nearly $23 billion. Greater size also promises increased negotiating heft with Boeing and Airbus. Investors have good reason to clear this deal for takeoff.  United Technologies’ last big aeronautics deal – paying $16.5 billion for Goodrich in 2011 – succeeded handily in lowering costs. The Farmington, Connecticut-based company originally promised $400 million of savings but ended up delivering $500 million. That was about 7.5 percent of the target’s annual operating costs prior to acquisition.  A similar level of efficiency gains at Rockwell Collins would produce $530 million of annual savings. Taxed at 30 percent, put on a multiple of 10 and discounted, these would be worth more than $3 billion today.  Rockwell Collins had a market capitalization of $19.3 billion prior to reports of a bid in early August. The Wall Street Journal reports the companies are discussing a purchase price of up to $140 per share. At that level, the takeout price would be a little under $23 billion – and the premium would be roughly equal to the expected savings.  There’s another, potentially more important, reason to pursue Rockwell Collins. In July Boeing said it was setting up a unit to produce avionics and electronic systems currently supplied by contractors like United Technologies and Rockwell Collins. Such moves by airplane makers threaten to squeeze their suppliers’ sales and operating margins, currently an attractive 20 percent or so. A merger could help United Technologies resist such pressure. It’s also risky and initially expensive for a company to start making its own parts, so Boeing may not want to bargain too hard against a key, large supplier.  Combining two big firms carries risks of its own. Airbus on Wednesday issued an unusual public statement cautioning United Technologies that it shouldn’t let M&A distract it from delivering engines that are already behind schedule. Yet Chairman and Chief Executive Gregory Hayes might take more comfort than concern from that warning. After all, if airplane makers are worried his pursuit of Rockwell will create a more powerful supplier, that’s probably an argument in favor of the deal.",8302017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rockwell-collins-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-united-technologies-avionics-bid-looks-airworthy-idUSKCN1BA2GQ

834,UTX,"UPDATE 5-UTC touts $23 bln deal as stock drops, Boeing turns critic","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors and Boeing Co gave two thumbs down on Tuesday to aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc. The acquisition, announced on Monday, would be the largest in aerospace history and create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and other plane makers.  United Tech shares were down 5.2 percent after Boeing said it would and use the power granted by its contracts with the companies, and its sway with regulators, “to protect our interests.” The stock had fallen more than 4 percent before Boeing’s statement, as analysts factored in United Tech’s decision to halt share buybacks for three to four years and earnings dilution caused by the cash-and-stock deal. Analysts expected $2 billion in buybacks in the second half of 2017 alone. The loss of years of buybacks and Boeing’s unusual blowback came as plane makers are pressing United Tech and other suppliers for price cuts and trying to compete against them on high-margin services and spare parts.  By making more of the components used on each Boeing and Airbus SE aircraft, analysts say, United Technologies-Rockwell Collins would gain leverage to resist that pressure.     United Tech Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who would lead the combined company, brushed aside Boeing’s concerns. “The whole idea of this deal is to be able to drive more innovative solutions at lower cost for our customers - both the (plane makers) and the airlines,” Hayes told Reuters on Tuesday, shortly before Boeing issued its criticism.  Rockwell’s skill with software combined with United Tech’s expertise in numerous aircraft components allows the company to offer new “digital” products that airlines want, he said. “We’ll be able to do predictive analytics that many others can’t do, and that’s how you add value to airline customers,” Hayes said, referring to data-crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail. Hayes said he had assured Airbus CEO Tom Enders that United Tech’s Pratt & Whitney unit will stay on track to deliver between 350 and 400 jetliner engines this year.  United Tech fell behind on engine deliveries this year due to production problems, and Airbus raised concern last week about the deal distracting United Tech. “Pratt has nothing to do with this,” Hayes said, noting United Tech’s aerospace unit, not Pratt, will combine with Rockwell Collins to create Collins Aerospace. Hayes also knocked down speculation that the purchase would prompt United Tech to spin off its Carrier air conditioner or Otis elevator units, saying the company needs their cash flow to help pay down debt from the deal. But Hayes did not rule out such sales in the longer term. “After the deal is done, and after we pay down some debt, we’re going to go back and look,” he said. If the company’s share price does not reflect its value, he said, “we’ll need to do something.” United Tech could sell “non-core pieces” such as home security in the meantime, Hayes said. But given taxes and lost earnings, “it’s hard to make financial sense out of those transactions” unless they fetch a high price, he said. Rockwell’s shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 in afternoon trading. United Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 5.2 percent to $111.82. “We see limited upside near term as share repurchase is withdrawn and deal timing becomes an investor focus,” analyst Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research Partners said in a note.  United Tech’s engines and systems portfolio has little overlap with the avionics, seats and interiors businesses of Rockwell, which Hayes said should mean little trouble during the necessary regulatory review. The combination, if successful, would mark the rise of a second engines-to-seating supplier, after jet-engine maker Safran SA’s pending $7.7-billion deal to buy seat maker Zodiac Aerospace. Safran said on Tuesday it would look at assets that might come up for sale after the United Tech-Rockwell deal.  United Tech expects to borrow $15 billion and will assume $7 billion in Rockwell debt to fund the deal, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2018.  United Tech said the acquisition would add to earnings in its first full year and yield at least $500 million in cost savings by the fourth year of operation.

North Korea on Sunday conducted its sixth nuclear test, which it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile, marking a dramatic escalation of the regime’s stand-off with the United States and its allies. “It looks as though escalation has gone to the next level, but there are lot of things in the coming weeks that may be causing people to get a little bit more cautious,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. Wall Street may face a rough ride in September, typically the worst month for stocks, if there is a showdown in Washington over the U.S. budget and the federal debt ceiling.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 29.90 points, or 0.46 percent, at 6,405.43. Nine of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower. Financial stocks were the worst hit, falling 1.46 percent, after an influential Federal Reserve policymaker struck a dovish tone on interest rates. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said U.S. inflation is falling “well short” of target so the central bank should be cautious about raising interest rates any further until it is confident that prices are headed higher. Goldman Sachs’ fell 3.4 percent, dragging down the Dow; while the S&P; was pulled lower by a more than 2 percent fall in shares of JPMorgan and Bank of America. “As far as interest rates go, everyone’s on a holding pattern to see what happens. No one’s expecting a September rate hike anyway, but we’ve got a lot of data until December that could change the chances of a rate hike,” Frederick said. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and his Dallas counterpart, Robert Kaplan, are also slated to speak at different events later in the day.

844,UTX,LPC: United Tech launches US$6.5bn loan for Rockwell Collins buy,"NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp launched a US$6.5bn loan on Wednesday to support the aerospace and industrial company’s US$23bn purchase of avionics supplier Rockwell Collins Inc, the largest merger ever in the aerospace sector, sources said. The financing is a 364-day bridge term loan that will ultimately be replaced by permanent bond debt, the sources said. It is the first loan backing merger and acquisition activity in the investment-grade aerospace arena so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. Morgan Stanley is administrative agent. The bank, along with HSBC Securities and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, are joint lead arrangers and bookrunners. Loan pricing details were not immediately available. The company on Tuesday said it expects to raise about US$14bn of new debt, as well as bring back US$1bn of foreign cash, to fund the cash portion of the deal. The acquisition, announced on Monday, is valued at US$30bn when including the US$7bn of Rockwell debt that United Technologies will be assuming. The merger is expected to close by the third quarter of next year. MICRO-BURST M&A; has come in a “micro-burst of activity” over the past few weeks, and likely will remain episodic through the rest of the year, one senior banker said of a wave of mergers between high-quality companies announced late in the summer. Other recent large tie-ups include Gilead Sciences Inc’s agreement to buy Kite Pharma Inc for about US$12bn, and Sempra Energy’s US$9.45bn acquisition of Texas electricity transmission and distribution grid operator Oncor Electric Delivery Co. Companies are “actively having discussions” about new M&A; opportunities, another senior banker said. “People are giving up on Washington, and moving forward” in the absence of any resolution about US tax reform, the banker said. United Technologies plans to fund the US$23bn purchase amount with two-thirds cash and one-third stock, according to a transcript of a conference call with analysts on Tuesday. The company’s senior unsecured debt is rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- by S&P;, both investment-grade rankings. Each of the agencies said they might cut the company’s credit rating by a notch, depending on the pace of deleveraging. Such a ratings reduction would maintain investment-grade credit quality.

845,UTX,"UTC touts $23 billion deal as stock drops, Boeing turns critic","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors and Boeing Co gave two thumbs down on Tuesday to aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc. The acquisition, announced on Monday, would be the largest in aerospace history and create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and other plane makers.  United Tech shares were down 5.2 percent after Boeing said it would and use the power granted by its contracts with the companies, and its sway with regulators, “to protect our interests.” The stock had fallen more than 4 percent before Boeing’s statement, as analysts factored in United Tech’s decision to halt share buybacks for three to four years and earnings dilution caused by the cash-and-stock deal. Analysts expected $2 billion in buybacks in the second half of 2017 alone. The loss of years of buybacks and Boeing’s unusual blowback came as plane makers are pressing United Tech and other suppliers for price cuts and trying to compete against them on high-margin services and spare parts.  By making more of the components used on each Boeing and Airbus SE aircraft, analysts say, United Technologies-Rockwell Collins would gain leverage to resist that pressure.     United Tech Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who would lead the combined company, brushed aside Boeing’s concerns. “The whole idea of this deal is to be able to drive more innovative solutions at lower cost for our customers - both the (plane makers) and the airlines,” Hayes told Reuters on Tuesday, shortly before Boeing issued its criticism.  Rockwell’s skill with software combined with United Tech’s expertise in numerous aircraft components allows the company to offer new “digital” products that airlines want, he said. “We’ll be able to do predictive analytics that many others can’t do, and that’s how you add value to airline customers,” Hayes said, referring to data-crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail. Hayes said he had assured Airbus CEO Tom Enders that United Tech’s Pratt & Whitney unit will stay on track to deliver between 350 and 400 jetliner engines this year.  United Tech fell behind on engine deliveries this year due to production problems, and Airbus raised concern last week about the deal distracting United Tech. “Pratt has nothing to do with this,” Hayes said, noting United Tech’s aerospace unit, not Pratt, will combine with Rockwell Collins to create Collins Aerospace. Hayes also knocked down speculation that the purchase would prompt United Tech to spin off its Carrier air conditioner or Otis elevator units, saying the company needs their cash flow to help pay down debt from the deal. But Hayes did not rule out such sales in the longer term. “After the deal is done, and after we pay down some debt, we’re going to go back and look,” he said. If the company’s share price does not reflect its value, he said, “we’ll need to do something.” United Tech could sell “non-core pieces” such as home security in the meantime, Hayes said. But given taxes and lost earnings, “it’s hard to make financial sense out of those transactions” unless they fetch a high price, he said. Rockwell’s shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 in afternoon trading. United Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 5.2 percent to $111.82. “We see limited upside near term as share repurchase is withdrawn and deal timing becomes an investor focus,” analyst Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research Partners said in a note.  United Tech’s engines and systems portfolio has little overlap with the avionics, seats and interiors businesses of Rockwell, which Hayes said should mean little trouble during the necessary regulatory review. The combination, if successful, would mark the rise of a second engines-to-seating supplier, after jet-engine maker Safran SA’s pending $7.7-billion deal to buy seat maker Zodiac Aerospace. Safran said on Tuesday it would look at assets that might come up for sale after the United Tech-Rockwell deal.  United Tech expects to borrow $15 billion and will assume $7 billion in Rockwell debt to fund the deal, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2018.  United Tech said the acquisition would add to earnings in its first full year and yield at least $500 million in cost savings by the fourth year of operation.

846,UTX,Boeing raises concern about $23 billion United Tech-Rockwell deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Tuesday it would look closely at United Technologies Corp’s $23 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins Inc, breaking its month-long silence on a deal. “We intend to take a hard look at the proposed combination of United Technologies and Rockwell Collins,” Boeing said in a statement.  “Until we receive more details, we are skeptical that it would be in the best interest of - or add value to - our customers and industry.” Boeing said its interest, and that of its customers, employees, suppliers and shareholders, was to ensure the long-term health and competitiveness of the aerospace industry supply chain. “Should we determine that this deal is inconsistent with those interests, we would intend to exercise our contractual rights and pursue the appropriate regulatory options to protect our interests,” the company said. “Also, both companies are significant suppliers to Boeing and other (plane makers), and at a time of record industry production, their first priority should be delivering on existing cost, schedule and quality commitments for their customers and ours.” ",9062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rockwell-collins-m-a-boeing/boeing-raises-concern-about-23-billion-united-tech-rockwell-deal-idUSKCN1BG2H0
847,UTX,United Tech to buy Rockwell Collins for $30 billion,"(Reuters) - Aerospace supplier United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) has struck a $30 billion agreement to buy avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N), the companies said on Monday, in a deal that bulks up UTC’s power with plane makers by creating one of the world’s largest makers of civilian and defense aircraft components. Farmington, Connecticut-based United Technologies will pay $140 per share for Rockwell Collins, split between $93.33 per in cash and $46.67 in stock, according to the companies. The price represents a 17.6 percent premium to Rockwell’s $119 share price before news of the talks emerged on Aug. 4. Shares of Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell Collins closed at $130.61 on Friday. U.S. markets were closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday.  The acquisition price implies a total transaction value of $30 billion, including Rockwell Collins’ debt, and a total equity value of $23 billion. United Tech said it plans to fund the cash portion through debt issuances and cash on hand.  Under the deal, the companies said that Rockwell Collins and UTC’s aerospace systems segment will be combined to create a new business unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.  “This acquisition adds tremendous capabilities to our aerospace businesses and strengthens our complementary offerings of technologically advanced aerospace systems,” UTC’s chairman and chief executive officer, Greg Hayes, said in the statement. “Together, Rockwell Collins and UTC Aerospace Systems will enhance customer value in a rapidly evolving aerospace industry by making aircraft more intelligent and more connected,” he said. The creation of a new giant in the top echelon of aircraft parts makers comes as planemakers Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus SE (AIR.PA) are trying to capture more of the profits earned by their suppliers. Both are pushing suppliers to lower prices and are moving into the high-margin aftermarket arena for parts and services that suppliers now enjoy. In a move seen as a threat to Rockwell, Boeing said in July that it would build up its own avionics business. Last week, Airbus urged supplier UTC to stay focused on fixing industrial problems that have delayed new aircraft deliveries. If plane makers “are going to take more of the aftermarket or demand more of the aftermarket, we’re going to have to think about how we price our products,” Hayes told analysts in July. By making more of the components needed on each aircraft, analysts say, United Technologies likely will gain some leverage to resist such pressures. The deal also follows a wave of consolidation among smaller aerospace manufacturers in recent years that was caused in part by the need to invest in new technologies such as metal 3-D printing and connected factories to stay competitive. A combined United Technologies and Rockwell Collins could similarly invest, and their broad portfolios have little overlap. United Technologies makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines used by Airbus, Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA) and other plane makers. It supplies engines for Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It also supplies such key components as landing gear, air conditioning systems and engine covers to a wide range of jetliners. Rockwell Collins is a major avionics supplier to Boeing and Airbus and other plane makers. In April it added passenger seating, cabin interiors, lavatories and galleys through its $6.4 billion acquisition of B/E Aerospace. The two companies have spent a month trying to reach an agreement, and their combined sales would be more than $62 billion, compared with about $95 billion for Boeing. United Technologies expects to close the purchase in the third quarter of 2018. The company, with a $94.2 billion market value, also owns Otis Elevator and air conditioner maker Carrier.  Rockwell Collins has a market value of $21.2 billion. The deal, which includes $7 billion in Rockwell’s debt, is expected to save more than $500 million by the fourth year after its completion, the companies said. Morgan Stanley & Co LLC was the financial adviser to United Tech, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was its legal adviser. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc were Rockwell’s financial advisers, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom was its legal adviser.

848,UTX,"United Tech, Rockwell deal faces bumpy road to approval, especially in the EU","PARIS/NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) faces a long road to win approval for its $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N), and the biggest bumps could be in Brussels rather than Washington. United Tech and Rockwell, who both supply airplane makers, say the overlap in their product lines is relatively small. Yet opponents of the deal could argue the combination gives the aircraft parts supply company undue market power. An early sign of trouble came when U.S. plane maker Boeing Co (BA.N) said it intended to take a “hard look” at the proposed deal. “Until we receive more details, we are skeptical that it would be in the best interest of—or add value to—our customers and industry,” Boeing said in a statement. The combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft, by dollar value, noted Kevin Michaels, president of consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, referring to such components as flight controls and air conditioning. Michaels said he does not see the deal facing an issue from a competitive standpoint as there is virtually no overlap in products between the two companies. Rockwell’s shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 while United Tech shares fell 5.7 percent to $111.21, in part on the warning from Boeing. There was also a sign that Airbus is preparing to ratchet up pressure behind the scenes. A source close to the European plane maker told Reuters there were concerns about a “disconnect” between United Technologies and the leadership of its Pratt & Whitney unit. Another Airbus source said any distraction due to the merger would benefit Pratt & Whitney’s main rival CFM International, co-owned by the U.S. manufacturer General Electric Co(GE.N) and France’s Safran (SAF.PA). Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned United Tech to focus on delivering jet engines on time. If Boeing or Airbus opts to complain to antitrust enforcers, they can take the complaint to Europe’s competition authority and either the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, both of which review proposed mergers for compliance with antitrust law. Their strongest argument would be if both companies made one or several parts and had few competitors. “Many initially assumed it would be a slam dunk because of the lack of overlap. But the EU probe may prove to be difficult, simply on the grounds that the combined company would be so big,” said Nick Cunningham, aerospace analyst at UK-based Agency Partners.               Boeing could also be concerned about the “portfolio effect,” where companies are able to exercise leverage based on the fact that they sell a wide range of specialized products to certain customers. This argument was used to doom GE’s plan to buy Honeywell in 2001, although it was European regulators rather than Washington who killed that deal. Boeing or other companies objecting to the deal could complain about a loss of competition. That would be the case if the government proves that either United Tech or Rockwell had plans to expand to compete with the other, said James Tierney, a former Justice Department antitrust expert now at the law firm Orrick. Antitrust enforcers would also be concerned by the reduced number of market players if United Tech and Rockwell were among the few companies that Boeing or Airbus could reach out to resolve technical problems, said Tierney.  That concern would be amplified if the Defense Department agreed, said Tierney. Both the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission review proposed mergers to ensure they are legal under antitrust law. It is unclear which of the agencies would review this deal, antitrust experts said.

851,UTX,UPDATE 4-Northrop Grumman to buy missile maker Orbital for $7.8 bln,"(Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) said on Monday it would buy Orbital ATK Inc (OA.N) for about $7.8 billion in a deal that gives it greater access to lucrative government contracts and expands its arsenal of missile defense systems and space rockets. The all-cash transaction is the biggest in the defense sector in two years and comes as North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons threats grow, heightening tensions with the United States and its allies. “Clearly, as we watch what’s happening around our globe, the rather rapid advance of some of our potential adversaries is quite concerning,” Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush said on a call with analysts. Although Northrop already has a significant presence in payloads, it has not had launcher capability, an area that Orbital brings for both space and missile defense, Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said on Monday. Orbital has contracts with NASA and the U.S. Army. The Dulles, Virginia-based company is one of the two firms hired by NASA to fly cargo to the International Space Station under an initial contract worth up to $3.1 billion. Northrop’s purchase of Orbital would help sharpen its focus on small space systems, launch vehicles, missiles and munitions. The deal also comes ahead of planned upgrades of U.S. ballistic systems, which are expected to drive demand for missiles, potentially benefiting companies such as Northrop. Shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD.N), a direct competitor with Orbital ATK in several space and missile businesses, rose 6.7 percent to $30.24, as the higher valuation for Orbital boosted Aerojet shares.  The U.S. Air Force has called for proposals to replace its aging nuclear missiles and intercontinental ballistic missile system as the military moves ahead with a costly modernization of its atomic weapons. Falls Church, Virginia-based Northrop’s other businesses, such as aerospace and mission systems and technology services, provide aircraft, electronic warfare systems and network defense services. “Given that Northrop already operates in the space field, it is possible that there could be some overlapping activity or increased vertical integration that could prompt regulatory scrutiny,” Stallard said. Northrop’s offer price of $134.50 per Orbital share represents a premium of 22 percent over the stock’s Friday close. Orbital’s shares gained 20 percent to $132.25 on Monday, while Northrop’s stock rose 3.3 percent. Northrop will assume $1.4 billion of Orbital’s net debt and expects to close the deal in the first half of 2018. Northrop’s last acquisition spree more than a decade ago included its 2002 purchase of TRW Inc for about $7.8 billion. Mergers of U.S. aerospace and defense firms has totaled $40.5 billion so far in 2017, the strongest year-to-date performance of all time for dealmaking in the industry, according to Thomson Reuters data. Perella Weinberg is the financial adviser to Northrop, while Citigroup is advising Orbital. Earlier this month, United Technologies (UTX.N) agreed to buy avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins (COL.N) in a $30-billion deal.

The deal would come as the firing of missiles by North Korea in recent months has focused attention on missile defense systems. With Orbital’s stock market value of $6.3 billion and $1.4 billion of long-term debt, the deal’s final value will likely exceed $7.7 billion. Northrop Grumman declined to comment. Orbital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     Orbital’s rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines would enlarge Northrop’s offerings to its largest customer, the U.S. Department of Defense, analyst Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners LLC said in a research note on Sunday.  The deal is noteworthy not only because it boosts Northrop’s exposure to missile defense, but also because the company has not bought a large rival in many years. It would also represent a departure from a focus of returning earnings to shareholders. Orbital ATK has contracts with NASA as well as the U.S. Army and the deal would give Northrop more than $4.4 billion in annual revenue according to Orbital’s 2016 financials. Despite infrequent strategic mergers, Northrop has not shied away from bold corporate actions to please investors. In 2011 Northrop spun off its Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII.N) shipbuilding business to shareholders. In 2009, it sold its government services business, TASC. Northrop’s last buying spree more than a decade ago included the 2002 purchase of TRW Inc for about $7.8 billion. Based on Friday’s closing stock price, Northrop was valued at $46.5 billion. The acquisition price could exceed $7.5 billion if a typical premium was attached to it, the Wall Street Journal said in a report published earlier on Sunday. Another reason for the deal could be the Pentagon’s efforts to rebuild missiles defenses. The Air Force had asked the defense industry last summer for proposals to replace the aging nuclear cruise missiles and intercontinental ballistic missile system as the military moved ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems. In August, Northrop received a $328 million contract to continue developing a replacement of the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system for the U.S. Air Force. Northrop is also the prime contractor for the B-21 bomber as well as the maker of the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle. Orbital is a subcontractor for composite structures on the B-21, and Callan of Capital Alpha Partners said the deal might spark concerns at the Pentagon because of vertical integration within that program.   So far this year Orbital’s stock has increased 25 percent as investors have eyed an increase in U.S. defense spending.

The narrow-body C919, which will compete with Boeing Co’s (BA.N) 737 and the Airbus SE (AIR.PA) A320, completed its second test flight on Thursday, almost five months after its maiden flight earlier this year in May. Shi Jianzhong, COMAC Vice President, said a number of “issues” relating to the plane’s technology and its engine had led to the lengthy gap between the C919’s first and second flight.   “We were being cautious,” he said, speaking at an event to announce the naming of a separate wide-body jet being developed by COMAC and Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), which will be called the CR929. “We expect future test flights to be very close together,” he said, adding that the next flight could be “a few days or one to two weeks” away. The almost five month-gap between the C919’s first and second flight was far longer than that of other planes, such as the Airbus A350 whose gap was five days. On the CR929, UAC said in a statement that the team had already decided on the plane’s family concept and its preliminary characteristics. Shi said that the plane was in the second, design-focused, stage of its development. The two companies’ joint venture, which was set up in May, will be called China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation (CRAIC), they said.

859,UTX,"United Technologies progresses on engine fixes, raises forecasts","(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) raised its full-year forecasts for the second time this year on Tuesday and said it was making progress in resolving issues with engines at its Pratt & Whitney business, allaying concerns of key aircraft customers. Quarterly sales and profit beat Street estimates despite  problems with its new fuel-saving geared turbofan (GTF) engines, which caused its customers to delay deliveries of planes. United Technologies was forced to take a $196 million charge in the quarter after it held back some shipments of GTF engines and offered spares to airlines, which had been facing problems with engines already in service. Shares of United Technologies initially rose nearly 2 percent, before retreating to stand just under 1 percent. Airbus, the biggest customer of GTF engines, rose 2.4 percent to a record. “It was unfortunate we couldn’t meet our commitments to Airbus (AIR.PA) and Bombardier (BBDb.TO), but they understood the need to keep the customers flying,” Chief Executive Greg Hayes said on a conference call. Easing a months-long standoff over delays in supplying engines, Hayes said the company also planned to make some design changes to improve engine durability. Reuters reported on Monday that Airbus had seen evidence of progress on technical problems at Pratt & Whitney and was more confident in the pace of shipments despite losing some engines to the spares pool: a shift confirmed by United Technologies on Tuesday.. United Technologies is spending more money to speed up production of its GTF engines that power Airbus’ newest narrow-body jet, the A320neo, and Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft. The company said it shipped 254 GTF engines year-to-date, and remained on track to build 350-400 GTF engines in 2017. United Technologies had delivered 138 of these engines in 2016. Hayes also defended United Technologies’ $23 billion proposal to buy Rockwell Collins (COL.N) to forge a giant new aerospace supplier after criticism from Boeing (BA.N), saying the U.S. planemaker had benefited from United Technologies’ earlier purchase of aero parts maker Goodrich. United Technologies raised its 2017 adjusted earnings per share forecast to $6.58-$6.63 from $6.45-$6.60. The company also increased the lower end of its sales forecast range to $59.0 billion from $58.5 billion, but kept the top end at $59.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share fell to $1.73 in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.76, but beat analysts’ expectations of $1.69, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

861,UTX,U.S. industrial shares hit record high as earnings shine,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. industrial sector roared to a record high on Tuesday following strong financial results from stalwarts 3M Co (MMM.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), even as shares of General Electric Co (GE.N) continued to struggle. The S&P; 500 industrials index .SPLRCI rose 0.7 percent, leading all major groups. Other sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth, such as financials .SPSY and materials .SPLRCM, also gained. Results showed a rebound for industrial companies whose shares have been under pressure the past couple of years as many of their key markets, such as energy, mining and agriculture, have struggled, said Edward Jones industrials analyst Matt Arnold. “What we are seeing in 2017 is a significant snap back in demand. It is driving higher sales at a time when these companies have done a lot to lean themselves out and tighten their belts,” Arnold said.  “What all this means is these companies are translating the sales snap-back into significant earnings growth and it is driving the stocks,” he said. Shares of diversified manufacturer 3M and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar led the sector’s gains, with both rising more than 5 percent after their results both easily topped Wall Street’s estimates for sales and earnings. The two stocks also propelled the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI to a record high. Caterpillar’s results helped boost shares of agriculture equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N), while shares of Stanley Black & Decker (SWK.N) climbed about 4 percent after the power tool maker’s results. General Motors Co (GM.N) shares meanwhile rose more than 1 percent after the automaker’s profit topped estimates. GM’s stock is part of the consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD but its results are seen as an indicator of the health of industrial manufacturing. Tuesday’s gains for the cyclical sectors signaled a potential rotation in the stock market. Shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more resistant to economic downturns, have led this year’s market rally. Not all industrial stocks gained on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) shares fell 2 percent after the weapons supplier’s results, while United Technologies’ (UTX.N) shares were little changed after the conglomerate’s report. Notably, shares of GE, the largest publicly traded industrial company, were down 1 percent, continuing their slide after the conglomerate reported earnings that fell far short of Wall Street expectations on Friday.

United Technologies Corp, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, held back some GTF shipments to plane makers and offered spares to airlines, which had faced problems with engines already in service. “Bombardier is working closely with Pratt & Whitney to evaluate and mitigate any potential impact on its customers and will provide a full update on November 2, when it issues its Q3 results,” spokeswoman Nathalie Siphengphet said by email. Both Bombardier and Airbus SE have faced delayed deliveries of separate GTF engines. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said recently that Pratt’s engine has “tremendous potential” despite initial “teething problems.” The European plane maker is taking a majority stake in the CSeries program for $1. “Pratt is working very hard to iron these out for our A320 family as well as for the CSeries,” he told Reuters in Montreal.  Montreal-based Bombardier has forecast deliveries of about 30 CSeries jets this year, but has only delivered 12 so far, raising questions about its ability to meet its guidance. “We’ve got some supplier challenges so you know, we’ll see how the ramp up goes,” Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer told Reuters on Friday. He did not provide names of suppliers. Korean Air Lines Co Ltd, which in August forecast it would receive five CSeries jets this year, expects to get “hopefully one” by the end of 2017 and six more in the first half of 2018, President Walter Cho said on Wednesday. Pratt & Whitney was delayed in producing a corrected engine liner required for the deliveries, he told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Taipei. “But I want to be clear I still have full confidence in Pratt & Whitney,” Cho said. “They have been our choice of power plant for over 30 years and I have no doubt they will fix the problem and it will be a good airplane for our fleet.” In April, Bombardier said Pratt would issue the liners for the engines in Korean’s order for delivery this past summer.  At the time, Bombardier instructed CSeries operators Swiss International Air Lines and airBaltic to inspect their engine combustion liners after 2,000 flight hours. Pratt & Whitney said it had added a combustor lining inspection to its regularly scheduled maintenance of the engine.

867,UTX,Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet program has spare parts shortage -GAO,"Oct 26 (Reuters) - Spare parts for Lockheed Martin Corp’s stealthy F-35 fighter jets are not keeping up with demand according to a report out on Thursday from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The report said “from January through August 7, 2017, F-35 aircraft were unable to fly about 22 percent of the time due to parts shortages.” Lockeed declined to comment. The shortages are expected to plague the fighter jet program for several years the report said. Partly to blame were “incomplete plans and funding that did not account for the long lead time parts.” In other instances, delays in the establishment of repair capabilities were blamed. The U.S. Department of Defense is maintaining more than 250 of the advanced F-35 jets and plans to triple the fleet by the end of 2021. In February, the Pentagon made a deal for a batch of 90 of the fighter aircraft agreeing to pay below $95 million per F-35A model jet for the first time, compared with $102 million in the previous purchase. The F-35 comes in three configurations: the A-model for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. allies; the B-model, which can handle short take-offs and vertical landings for the Marine Corps and British navy; and the carrier-variant F-35C jets. Ten other nations including Australia, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, South Korea, Britain are also customers. Lockheed, the prime contractor, and its partners including Northrop Grumman Corp, United Technologies Corp’s Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc have been working on building a more cost-effective supply chain to fuel the production line in Fort Worth, Texas. In all, the Pentagon expects to buy 2,457 jets.

Sales in United Technologies’ Pratt & Whitney unit, which makes aircraft engines, were up 11.7 percent, while aerospace systems sales, which include engine parts and aircraft lighting, rose 5.7 percent. Even as it gains from the surge in aircraft demand, the company is trying to speed up production of its fuel-saving turbofan engines that power Airbus’ newest narrow-body jet, the A320neo, and Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft. The production ramp is expected to result in $1.1 billion worth of engine margin losses in 2018, the company said. The company, which also makes Otis Elevators, forecast full year adjusted earnings in the range of $6.85 to $7.10 per share, up 3 percent to 6.8 percent from a year earlier. The midpoint of that range came in slightly below analysts’ average estimate of $7.00 per share. Its sales forecast of $62.5 billion to $64.0 billion, while analysts’ were expecting $63.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s shares, up 23.3 percent in the past 12 months, were little changed at $135.75 in premarket trading. Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri told Reuters on Wednesday that the company expects to quickly repatriate $2 billion in overseas cash under the new U.S. tax law. The latest quarter included a 90-cent charge related to the new U.S. tax law. UTC expects to make net cash payment of $1.5 billion through 2026, and use the tax windfall partly to reduce borrowing for its acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL.N). For the fourth quarter, net sales rose 7 percent to $15.68 billion, topping Wall Street’s expectation of $15.40 billion. The company’s income from continuing operations attributable to common share owners fell to $397 million, or 50 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.01 billion, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, UTC earned $1.60 per share, higher than the $1.56 per share expected by analysts.

888,UTX,"UPDATE 5-Lockheed Martin revenue beats, outlook strong for 2018","(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) reported quarterly revenue on Monday that beat Wall Street estimates, helped by higher F-35 fighter jet sales, and forecast better-than-expected 2018 profit.  The U.S. defense contractor said quarterly sales in its aeronautics business, its biggest, rose 11.8 percent to $6.05 billion. The profit margin for the division grew by 20 percent in the quarter as the F-35 program continued to mature.  At the same time, Lockheed took a $1.9 billion charge in the fourth quarter, mainly due to bringing back overseas profits and writing down the value of future tax benefits. Both charges were related to the new U.S. tax code that was signed into law in December.  Lockheed gave an adjusted figure for earnings from continuing operations of $4.30 per share. The Bethesda, Maryland-based company intends to take advantage of the tax cut windfall to front-load billions in pension contributions before tax rates fall in 2018. The move was foreshadowed by Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner during the third-quarter conference call with analysts.  Lockheed plans to pump $5 billion into its pension scheme before Sept. 15, allowing the funds to be redesignated to 2017. Like its peers in the United States, Lockheed is also expected to gain from an increase in defense spending under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Shares of the company rose nearly 2 percent to $351.42 after touching an all time high of $354.26 earlier on Monday, after it posted record annual sales in 2017 of $51 billion.  Excluding a deferred non-cash gain of $122 million, or 43 cents per share, and the tax charges, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S calculations showed Lockheed earned $3.87 per share in the fourth quarter, versus analyst estimates of $4.07 per share.     Strength in the aeronautics business helped boost overall net sales to $15.14 billion from $13.75 billion a year earlier, beating Wall Street estimates of $14.72 billion. Adjusted for new accounting standards from Jan. 1, Lockheed said it expects 2018 net sales in the range of $50 billion to$51.5 billion and earnings per share of $15.20 to $15.50. Analysts on average had previously expected full-year earnings per share of $14 and revenue of $51.2 billion. Lockheed’s research and development included “a range of things that we’re investing in, such as hypersonics and directed energy, and things that would help with any kind of a threat that comes early on,” chief executive Marillyn Hewson said during a post-earnings call with analysts. Electromagnetic “directed energy” weapons such as lasers and microwaves could soon be used more widely by the U.S. military.  On Friday, Lockheed was awarded a $150 million contract for a Surface Navy Laser Weapon System to develop, manufacture, and deliver two test units in fiscal year 2020, a contract that could eventually grow to $942 million, according to the Pentagon. The capability is being developed for Arleigh Burke class destroyers so the ships could temporarily debilitate surveillance craft.        The U.S. Defense Department expects to spend some $391 billion over 15 years to develop and buy 2,456 of the supersonic F-35 warplanes. Trump is expected to ask for $716 billion in defense spending in the 2019 budget he is set to unveil next month, a 7 percent increase over the 2018 budget. The 2018 $700 billion budget still has not passed through Congress.  But analysts have panned the news of Trump’s 2019 increase as small once adjusted for inflation. For the year, sales in Lockheed’s aeronautics division rose to $20.1 billion from $17.7 billion while profit margins increased slightly to 10.7 percent. Rotary and Mission Systems, which makes Sikorsky helicopters and ships, ended the year strong with quarterly net sales up 14 percent to $4.35 billion from $3.81 billion. Lockheed’s CFO said that the CH-53K helicopter, a new program for the U.S. Marines, is expected to ramp up as the Black Hawk program slows. Tanner told analysts, “you should think of the downturn in Black Hawk helicopter deliveries being offset by upticks in 53K volume.” Tanner said the CH-53K is slated to debut at the Berlin air show in April, as Reuters reported in November. Lockheed said accounting issues it had identified at Sikorsky had been rectified, while reporting no significant problems. Lockheed purchased Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) in November 2016.

890,UTX,UPDATE 1-Pratt details engine glitch affecting Airbus jet deliveries,"(Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney said on Monday it expects to present a fix to European regulators this week for a problem with its new geared turbofan jet engine that halted deliveries of Airbus’ (AIR.PA) latest version of its most popular aircraft model. Pratt, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), has suffered a series of problems with the new engine, but had said in January that the problems were largely behind it. Europe’s air safety regulator on Friday issued an emergency warning about “inflight shutdown” of the engines. On Monday, Pratt said the issue affects 43 engines on 32 A320neos. Pratt said it was evaluating another 55 engines delivered to Airbus that are part of the group thought to have the problem. Airbus said last week there were currently 113 Pratt-powered A320neo aircraft flying with 18 customers. The European plane maker said it had delivered one Pratt-powered plane this year, to a Chinese customer in February.  Airbus data show it faced a dearth of Pratt & Whitney deliveries in January, when it delivered six A320neo-family aircraft, all powered by Pratt’s competitor CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric Co (GE.N) and Safran of France (SAF.PA).    Pratt said the latest problems were discovered in January and early February, and stem from an engineering change the company made last summer to the “knife-edge seal” in the high-pressure compressor near the rear of the engine. Airbus shares fell on Monday, but United Technology shares were up 1 percent to 126.35 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after falling 3 percent last week when news of the issue emerged. While acknowledging Pratt’s problems, some analysts downplayed the risk for investors. Several analysts recently upped their price targets for the stock. Pratt has delivered about 550 engines so far and said in January it aims to double output this year. “It seems reasonable to conclude that only 30 to 40 engines or 15 to 20 aircraft are affected at this point, which is a small number,” analyst Carter Copeland and Melius Research wrote in a note published Monday.  Declines in United Technologies’ share price are a reason to buy the stock, he added, “but we don’t feel a sense of urgency given the program’s history of struggles.” In a statement, Pratt said it would discuss the potential affect on 2018 engine production after regulators respond to its proposal to fix the problem.

891,UTX,U.S. regulator warns about Pratt engine shutdown risk on Airbus jets,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New engines made by Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) for the latest Airbus (AIR.PA) single-aisle jetliner, the A320neo, pose a potential shutdown risk, the U.S. aviation regulator said on Wednesday.  The Federal Aviation Administration’s formal warning follows a similar action by European regulators on Feb. 9, and cites a “knife edge seal fracture” in the engine that could lead to an engine stall “and consequent inflight shutdown and rejected takeoffs,” the FAA said in an airworthiness directive. The warnings mark the latest in a string of issues that have clouded the rollout of Pratt’s new engines, which compete with market-leader CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric Co (GE.N) and Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France.  A total of 98 engines could be affected, with 43 confirmed to have the problem and the rest possibly affected, Pratt said. The company declined to comment further. Pratt has not halted production or delivery of the engines, and the Connecticut-based company plans to submit a proposal to European regulators on Friday detailing how to fix the problem, according to a person familiar with the situation.  It wasn’t clear how quickly the European Aviation Safety Agency could approve the plan. The problem affects only PW-1100 series engines, not similar Pratt engines for Bombardier, Embraer or Mitsubishi jets, the source said.     Airbus halted delivery of A320neos after delivering 113 of them. It was not immediately clear which airlines had the largest fleet. Industry sources said 20 Airbus A320neos had been grounded by airlines because of the problem.

Pratt, part of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), said its solution to the “knife-edge seal” issue was based on a design with which it had “significant experience,” without giving further details. Reuters had reported earlier on Wednesday that the company was likely to return to a previous seal as a way of temporarily dealing with the issue that safety authorities warned could shutdown a plane’s engine mid-flight. Some A320neo deliveries were halted after problems arose in January, which Pratt has said stems from an engineering change it made last summer to the “knife-edge seal” in the high-pressure compressor near the rear of the engine. Pratt said it will restart engine deliveries in early March. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said last week that deliveries to customers should resume in April.

897,UTX,"US STOCKS-Dow, S&P; climb on energy and industrials; Nasdaq falls","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P; 500 advanced on Thursday to halt a two-session losing skid, buoyed by gains in industrial and energy shares as U.S. Treasury yields eased, while the Nasdaq lost ground for a third straight session.  Major indexes advanced early as worries about a faster pace of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve were eased by comments by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who expressed concerns that a “bunch of hikes” could turn Fed policy restrictive. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields US10YT=RR retreated from the more than four-year highs hit on Wednesday. Those gains faded, however, and major indexes finished well off session highs as investors exercised caution in what is likely to be a rising interest rate environment. “The rally on Bullard was a little overzealous,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.  “I wouldn’t be out there aggressively buying stocks because until the interest rate picture clarifies, and it probably will do so at a higher level, it is just going to create problems for equities,” he said. The concerns over rising interest rates have dogged Wall Street of late, and stocks stumbled on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting showed the central bank’s rate-setting committee grew more confident in the need to keep raising rates. Market participants are still largely expecting the Fed to raise rates three times this year, beginning with its next meeting in March. Despite the recent climb in rates, many analysts expect the stock market to be able to absorb the rise as long as economic data remain supportive and the pace of the increase is modest.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 164.7 points, or 0.66 percent, to 24,962.48, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 2.63 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,703.96, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 8.14 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,210.09. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.9225 percent, from 2.941 percent late on Wednesday. Industrial shares climbed 0.59 percent, led by a 3.04 percent gain in Quanta Services Inc (PWR.N) after its quarterly results and a 3.34 percent rise in United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) after the aero parts maker said it is exploring a breakup of its business portfolio. Energy stocks .SPNY, up 1.08 percent, also helped support gains, as oil prices advanced on a surprise draw in U.S. crude inventories.  Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) shares surged 21.67 percent, their biggest daily percentage gain since April 2016, after the company’s quarterly results and outlook. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted two new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 47 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.81 billion shares, compared to the 8.44 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

898,UTX,"UPDATE 2-Ackman ends public battle with Herbalife, takes stake in United Technologies","(Reuters) - Six years ago, billionaire investor William Ackman wagered $1 billion that Herbalife’s stock price would tumble to zero after publicly calling the nutrition company a fraud in a three-hour presentation before investors, analysts and the media. On Wednesday there was little fanfare when the hedge fund manager let slip to a cable news reporter that his Pershing Square Capital Management was no longer betting against Herbalife.  Now, Ackman is building a position in aircraft parts maker United Technologies Corp, whose shares rose as much as 3.4 percent to $138.49. Rather than fall, Herbalife stock has risen since Ackman began shorting it. Pershing Square’s total loss was unknown. The stock on Wednesday traded as high as $95.88 a share, up from about $45 in 2012 when Ackman began his campaign.   The exit from Herbalife and the new position in United Technologies, first reported by CNBC, were confirmed by a person familiar with the situation. Pershing Square has not disclosed when it began buying United Technologies stock and declined to comment.  For years Ackman claimed Herbalife was running an illegal pyramid scheme in which distributors of its diet shakes and other products earned more money from bringing recruits into the network than selling. Last year, Ackman converted the Herbalife short position into a bet against the company through put options. This helped limit the potential losses for Pershing Square, though even that position has been closed. He also said he would not be speaking about it publicly anymore. With that, Ackman turned the page on one of Wall Street’s most bitter investment battles that pitted him against rival billionaire Carl Icahn, who became Herbalife’s biggest shareholder soon after Ackman publicly unveiled the short. The bet dented Pershing Square’s long-term performance and turned Ackman into a social activist as he stepped up a crusade against a company he said was harming many minorities with false promises of financial success by selling Herbalife.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission probed the matter, and eventually reached a settlement with Herbalife. It involved a $200 million penalty and requirements that the company reform some of its business practices. Investors in Ackman’s $9 billion fund quietly applauded the decision to forget about Herbalife, saying it is part of the manager’s strategy to rebuild his performance record after three years of losses. Ackman told investors in January that he would focus more on investments and let his partners do the marketing. In January, Ackman said he was making a new bet on Nike. Now he is also making a bet on United Tech. Last week, the company’s CEO, Greg Hayes, said it was exploring a breakup of its business portfolio, including jet engines, elevators and air conditioners. United Technologies declined to comment. Herbalife earlier on Wednesday said it planned to change its corporate name, refinance debt and effect a 2-for-1 stock split to boost shareholder returns, sending its shares up 7 percent to an all-time high. By aggressively buying back its shares, Herbalife was making it extremely dangerous for short sellers, analysts said.

901,UTX,"Ackman ends public battle with Herbalife, takes stake in United Technologies","(Reuters) - Six years ago, billionaire investor William Ackman wagered $1 billion that Herbalife’s stock price would tumble to zero after publicly calling the nutrition company a fraud in a three-hour presentation before investors, analysts and the media. On Wednesday there was little fanfare when the hedge fund manager let slip to a cable news reporter that his Pershing Square Capital Management was no longer betting against Herbalife.  Now, Ackman is building a position in aircraft parts maker United Technologies Corp, whose shares rose as much as 3.4 percent to $138.49. Rather than fall, Herbalife stock has risen since Ackman began shorting it. Pershing Square’s total loss was unknown. The stock on Wednesday traded as high as $95.88 a share, up from about $45 in 2012 when Ackman began his campaign.   The exit from Herbalife and the new position in United Technologies, first reported by CNBC, were confirmed by a person familiar with the situation. Pershing Square has not disclosed when it began buying United Technologies stock and declined to comment.  For years Ackman claimed Herbalife was running an illegal pyramid scheme in which distributors of its diet shakes and other products earned more money from bringing recruits into the network than selling. Last year, Ackman converted the Herbalife short position into a bet against the company through put options. This helped limit the potential losses for Pershing Square, though even that position has been closed. He also said he would not be speaking about it publicly anymore. With that, Ackman turned the page on one of Wall Street’s most bitter investment battles that pitted him against rival billionaire Carl Icahn, who became Herbalife’s biggest shareholder soon after Ackman publicly unveiled the short. The bet dented Pershing Square’s long-term performance and turned Ackman into a social activist as he stepped up a crusade against a company he said was harming many minorities with false promises of financial success by selling Herbalife.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission probed the matter, and eventually reached a settlement with Herbalife. It involved a $200 million penalty and requirements that the company reform some of its business practices. Investors in Ackman’s $9 billion fund quietly applauded the decision to forget about Herbalife, saying it is part of the manager’s strategy to rebuild his performance record after three years of losses. Ackman told investors in January that he would focus more on investments and let his partners do the marketing. In January, Ackman said he was making a new bet on Nike. Now he is also making a bet on United Tech. Last week, the company’s CEO, Greg Hayes, said it was exploring a breakup of its business portfolio, including jet engines, elevators and air conditioners. United Technologies declined to comment. Herbalife earlier on Wednesday said it planned to change its corporate name, refinance debt and effect a 2-for-1 stock split to boost shareholder returns, sending its shares up 7 percent to an all-time high. By aggressively buying back its shares, Herbalife was making it extremely dangerous for short sellers, analysts said.

902,UTX,GRAPHIC-GE value could slip to lowest among large U.S. industrials,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N), which was the most valuable publicly traded U.S. industrial conglomerate at the beginning of the year, could sink to the No. 4 spot after a prolonged selloff that has shaken confidence in the company. Valued at close to $580 billion at the turn of the millennium, GE has dropped to around $125 billion and it was surpassed in value by 3M Co (MMM.N) in January for the first time since the 1970s. At one point last week, the gap between GE and fellow U.S. industrial Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) was $6 billion, or 5 percent. The difference between GE and United Tech Corp’s (UTX.N) market values fell to $15 billion. (GRAPHIC: GE Market value - reut.rs/2D6JFB5) Helping to narrow the gap is a 45 percent slide in GE stock over 2017 and a 16 percent fall this year. Driven in value by a series of investments in several sectors during the 1990s, GE is now paying the price for focusing outside its traditional industrial manufacturing turf, while its rivals have enjoyed a more steady ascent thanks to a sharper focus on their industrial roots. “All the large-cap diversified industrials like Honeywell, United Technologies and 3M to name a few, have benefited from some of the money that’s come out of GE,” said JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa, who has a five-star rating on Thomson Reuters Eikon for recommendation performance. “You’re really talking about maybe a mid-teens stock at 2020 ... $20 I think is a very long-term target that really isn’t in the equation at this point,” Tusa said of GE’s shares, which closed at $14.64 on Monday. Tusa rates GE’s stock “underweight” with a price target of $14. But some analysts are optimistic about GE’s stock and future prospects. William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann believes that the worse could be over for GE, and its shares are likely to begin stabilizing before moving higher as 2018 progresses. “I think GE shares have been a bit oversold due to excessive fears about liquidity,” Heymann wrote in a note. Heymann cites higher oil prices, improving performance of GE’s aviation and healthcare businesses, and the recent nomination of three “exceptionally talented” directors to GE’s board. He has an “outperform” rating on the stock.  GE shares slid even after the company replaced Jeff Immelt as CEO last August with John Flannery. His turnaround plan, which includes cutting jobs, slashing GE’s dividend and a possible break-up of the conglomerate, is likely to take a year or more to show results. When Immelt took over in September 2001, GE was the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company. But during his tenure, which ended July 2017, the stock price fell about 40 percent. Over Jack Welch’s stint as CEO from 1981 to 2001, GE’s value rose from $13 billion to several hundred billions of dollars. Welch has since written or co-written bestselling books on management. (GRAPHIC: GE share performance under three different CEOs - reut.rs/2Fh6rfu) GE’s stock trades at roughly 14 times its forecasted earnings, well below the multiples of its peers, as the graphic below shows. The number helps investors gauge the value of a company relative to its earnings. Saint Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, best known for its Post-it notes and Scotch tape, saw its stock rise nearly 32 percent last year thanks to strong results that helped the company lift its yearly earnings forecast three times. Honeywell’s stock also rose around 32 percent in 2017, as the company sold more aircraft parts and as its energy customers bought more industrial equipment. Its warehouse automation equipment and software benefited from an ecommerce boom. (GRAPHIC: GE Forward Earnings - reut.rs/2FlZtGg) “We like Honeywell, given a solid management team and exposure to end markets we favor,” said Richard Grasfeder, a portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth LLC, which holds about 787,600 shares in GE as of the end of 2017. United Tech, which sells the Pratt & Whitney jet engines, has a “significant long-term advantage” over GE, Grasfeder said. “We think United Tech could provide learning points for GE management and investors,” Grasfeder said. “Good leadership is critical.” ",3072018,http://www.reuters.com/article/ge-stocks/graphic-ge-value-could-slip-to-lowest-among-large-u-s-industrials-idUSL8N1QH6XO
903,UTX,U.S. F-35 fighter modernization could cost $16 bln through 2024,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon estimates it will cost nearly $16 billion to modernize the fleet of F-35 jets through 2024, a U.S. lawmaker said on Wednesday, citing information provided by the Pentagon on the stealth fighter jet program. The F-35, which is made by Lockheed Martin Corp, has been in production since 2006 and modernization expenses were expected. More than 270 of the jets are currently flying. The F-35 has been widely criticized for being too expensive, including by President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials, who have also pointed to numerous production delays and cost overruns. Wednesday was the first time the $16 billion modernization estimate was made public. Modernization costs would be split between $10.8 billion for software development and $5.4 billion for deploying the updates and other procurement in support of the modernization efforts, Representative Niki Tsongas said at a hearing of a subcommittee of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, citing the information provided by the Pentagon.   Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, the head of the F-35 Joint Program Office which administers the program, provided some detail on the modernization program. “Continuous enhancements and improvements will be made to increase capabilities that make the F-35 more lethal and survivable,” Winter told the panel. U.S. lawmakers and independent watchdogs are keeping tabs on the upgrade program after years of cost overruns and delays. U.S. officials said Lockheed Martin has made progress on cutting costs since a major restructuring of F-35 production in 2010. The nearly $16 billion figure represented the outer limit of the modernization costs to bring all of the jets to their maximum potential currently known as “Block 4,” Winter told reporters after the hearing. The Pentagon was uncertain all F-35s would necessarily need to undergo this level of modernization. International customers were estimated to be responsible for $3.7 billion of the $10.8 billion software development costs, with the United States shouldering the rest, spending about $1 billion per year over the seven-year plan, Winter said.  The costs would be for the more than 270 F-35 jets currently in the field and others that come off the production line in the near future.  Winter said he expected Lockheed to deliver 91 jets in 2018. Lockheed and its partners, including Northrop Grumman Corp, United Technologies Corp’s Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc, have been working on building a more cost-effective supply chain.

905,UTX,FOCUS-New Boeing jet to accelerate services shake-up,"(Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) is doubling down on its landmark new strategy designed to muscle in on the business of maintenance providers by making its next jet the laboratory for in-house services that could radically alter the global business model for selling planes. Unlike Boeing’s last all-new design, the 787 Dreamliner, its proposed new mid-market plane will not bring a flood of revolutionary technical designs to the drawing board. But it will give the world’s largest plane maker a chance to test its new business approach of designing the plane so that it generates lucrative services revenues for Boeing while also offering efficiencies to airlines over the aircraft’s decades-long lifespan. Along with production costs, the new approach could help Boeing decide whether to invest the $15 billion or more in development needed to build the jet. “If we decide to launch, it’s a big investment and it’s an investment that has to contemplate not only the product itself but all of our other strategic objectives,” Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters. “So you can imagine we would want to look at this airplane through the lens of lifecycle value as we are growing our services business,” he said. Until recently, Boeing and Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA) sold planes with little involvement in the way they were operated and maintained. Instead, that was work carried out by their own suppliers or third-party shops. Heavy outsourcing on jets like the 787 expanded the trend by leaving suppliers - such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), which supplies the 787’s carbon wings - in command of key components. While Boeing and others squeezed their balance sheets to launch jets, many of their suppliers used their design influence to forge profitable relationships directly with airlines as they conducted part swaps or repairs required by regulators. “That seems a little out of balance, doesn’t it?” said Muilenburg, describing how the pendulum is now swinging back to give Boeing more control over parts and therefore the stream of aftermarket services that comes with owning a part’s design. “We do take the majority of the risk in developing new products, and we think that would cause us to want to gain the financial benefit of that risk-taking for the long term,” he said.  The long-term approach to the new jet is the latest evidence of changes in the $180 billion aero-aftermarket as planemakers jostle with suppliers - and even airlines - for control of repairs, training and data in pursuit of higher margins.  Last year, Boeing centralized services formerly spread across the company in a new division with a goal to more than treble sales to $50 billion in a decade.  The new unit posted operating margins of 15.4 percent last year, compared with 16.1 percent that United Technologies Aerospace Systems (UTX.N), a major supplier, earned from selling new equipment, services and aftermarket parts. The aftermarket is not entirely new to Boeing, and is common in defense, where Muilenburg ran services between 2008 and 2009. Airbus set ambitious internal targets last week and Canada’s Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) is banking on maintenance. But after airplane demand peaked since 2014, Boeing has turned more aggressively to parts and services to help meet a target of doubling margins to the mid-teens by 2020. Its core jet margin widened to 9.6 percent last year from 3.4 percent in 2016. To support the strategy, Boeing is bringing back key in-house technology like avionics - the brains of a modern jet -partly with an eye to future aftermarket revenue. “It is important that we build out vertical capabilities that sustain our engineering depth...as airplanes become more digital,” Muilenburg said, adding that broader growth in the industry would also provide a boon to suppliers. Suppliers say Boeing is also less willing than before to share risks - and profits - with them on the systems they do build. Instead it wants them to build to Boeing’s designs rather than leaving them with keys to the all-important aftermarket.  Already, there are signs the mid-market jet could see a swing away from risk-sharing towards straight procurement deals,the head of a major supplier told Reuters. “It depends on the area of the airplane we are talking about but we are very clear in our intent to grow our services business, and part of that is bringing back inside some engineering and intellectual property,” Muilenburg commented. The downside of doing more by itself, suppliers and analysts say, is that Boeing could weaken access to outside innovation, import risk and tie up capital and finite engineering resources. Depending on how far this goes, industry sources say it may also herald gradual changes in patterns of cash generation.  While planemakers get paid on delivery, engine makers charge little upfront and make money on services provided over years.  Some analysts say new plane manufacturer strategies suggest those business models could start to converge and put pressure on them to be more generous with discounts on jets. Muilenburg declined to address pricing directly, but acknowledged Boeing’s cradle-to-grave services strategy could have some impact on the timing of future income. “The services business tends to be accretive to margin, but this does give us the flexibility of where we drive margin in the business with the idea of raising the bar overall,” he said when asked if bundling services could lead to bigger jet discounts.

915,UTX,United Tech results beat as booming air travel spurs demand,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) reported quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates on Tuesday and raised its full-year forecasts, citing higher demand for spare parts and services from airlines dealing with booming passenger travel. Shares of the maker of Otis Elevators, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and Carrier air conditioners rose as much as 3 percent to $125.50. Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri told Reuters that United Tech expects to meet its full-year target for engine deliveries to Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and is optimistic that its suppliers can keep pace with rising engine production. The Pratt & Whitney unit, which has faced a series of setbacks with its geared turbofan engine, halted deliveries for the Airbus A320neo for almost a month earlier this year after discovering a new problem. The issues are coming under control and “we feel very good about the supply chain and our ability to support Airbus requirements,” Johri said. The company raised its 2018 adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $6.95-$7.15 from $6.85-$7.10, and full-year sales to a range of $63 billion to $64.5 billion from $62.5 billion to $64 billion.  United Tech said the decision to increase its earnings and sales forecasts this early in the year is unusual and reflected its confidence in its performance. “We never raise the outlook in the first quarter,” Johri said. The company said sales in its Pratt & Whitney unit, which also makes the engine for Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 combat jets, rose 15.2 percent. Its aerospace systems division, which makes engine components and provides spare parts, overhaul and repair services, reported a 5.7 percent rise in sales. “United Tech’s first quarter aero aftermarket results were strong once again and read across well to other aero suppliers (Safran, Rolls-Royce and TransDigm) as we begin 1Q18 earnings season,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said. Sales in the company’s unit that makes Carrier air conditioners and video surveillance systems were up 7 percent.  United Tech has seen about a 1 percent increase in costs so far because of recent U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. “We are hoping it just results in negotiations (between United States and China) and (more) tariffs don’t come into play,” Johri said. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.77 per share, beating analysts’ expectation of $1.52 per share.

916,UTX,UPDATE 3-United Tech results beat as booming air travel spurs demand,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) reported quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates on Tuesday and raised its full-year forecasts, citing higher demand for spare parts and services from airlines dealing with booming passenger travel. Shares of the maker of Otis Elevators, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and Carrier air conditioners rose as much as 3 percent to $125.50. Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri told Reuters that United Tech expects to meet its full-year target for engine deliveries to Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and is optimistic that its suppliers can keep pace with rising engine production. The Pratt & Whitney unit, which has faced a series of setbacks with its geared turbofan engine, halted deliveries for the Airbus A320neo for almost a month earlier this year after discovering a new problem. The issues are coming under control and “we feel very good about the supply chain and our ability to support Airbus requirements,” Johri said. The company raised its 2018 adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $6.95-$7.15 from $6.85-$7.10, and full-year sales to a range of $63 billion to $64.5 billion from $62.5 billion to $64 billion.  United Tech said the decision to increase its earnings and sales forecasts this early in the year is unusual and reflected its confidence in its performance. “We never raise the outlook in the first quarter,” Johri said. The company said sales in its Pratt & Whitney unit, which also makes the engine for Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 combat jets, rose 15.2 percent. Its aerospace systems division, which makes engine components and provides spare parts, overhaul and repair services, reported a 5.7 percent rise in sales. “United Tech’s first quarter aero aftermarket results were strong once again and read across well to other aero suppliers (Safran, Rolls-Royce and TransDigm) as we begin 1Q18 earnings season,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said. Sales in the company’s unit that makes Carrier air conditioners and video surveillance systems were up 7 percent.  United Tech has seen about a 1 percent increase in costs so far because of recent U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. “We are hoping it just results in negotiations (between United States and China) and (more) tariffs don’t come into play,” Johri said. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.77 per share, beating analysts’ expectation of $1.52 per share. Net sales rose to $15.24 billion, above the $14.64 billion expected by the market, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

917,UTX,UPDATE 1-Airbus CEO says post-Brexit production shift open for discussion,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) will not move its existing activities out of Britain when the country leaves the European Union but could forgo basing new projects there, its chief executive said on Tuesday. “I do not see that we kind of pick up and move somewhere else. But of course for future activities, future production, future development, that is open for discussion,” Tom Enders told reporters on the sidelines of the Berlin Aviation Summit.  Airbus employs 15,000 people in Britain where it makes all the wings for its commercial aircraft. The planemaker has previously said it needs to decide whether to spend more on parts in order to build up an extra buffer of stock to cope with potential disruption when Britain leaves the European Union on March 29, 2019. Asked about Airbus’s possible role in a new European fighter jet project, Enders said the group was in “good discussions” with other companies that may take part, especially with Dassault (AVMD.PA). France and Germany are expected to announce initial details about the planned new warplane development program at the ILA Berlin Air Show, which starts on Wednesday, with France’s Dassault aiming to take the lead. Enders said Airbus aimed to avoid the problems seen on the multinational A400M military transport program. “We never want to come to a situation again where the program is heavily burdened by too many somewhat conflicting requirements or governments telling us which engines or suppliers to take,” he said. “That means clear requirements, joint requirements from the customer side, not everybody having 12 different versions,” he added. He also stuck with a target for Airbus to deliver 800 aircraft this year, saying he was encouraged by upbeat comments by U.S. manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTC) (UTX.N). UTC’s Pratt & Whitney unit halted deliveries of its Geared Turbofan engine for the Airbus A320neo for almost a month this year, but group finance chief Akhil Johri told Reuters on Tuesday that the group expected to meet its full-year target for engine deliveries to Airbus. “It is no secret that this will be a challenge for the rest of the year, but the positive comments from UTC are certainly an additional encouragement to believe that we can make our guidance,” Enders said.

920,UTX,US STOCKS-Futures rise as Caterpillar leads batch of strong earnings,"* Caterpillar, United Tech among Dow members to top results * Verizon, Coca-Cola profit also beat estimates * Google-parent Alphabet dips on worries of rising costs * Futures up: Dow 0.63 pct, S&P; 0.58 pct, Nasdaq 0.55 pct By Sruthi Shankar April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Tuesday as bond yields eased, while strong earnings from industrial heavyweights Caterpillar and United Technologies helped reinforce optimism about a first-quarter earnings season now in full swing. A slew of strong reports from Dow Jones Industrial Average components put the blue-chip index on track to open up more than 160 points. Shares of Caterpillar jumped 3.7 percent in premarket trading, while Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines-maker United Tech rose 2.6 percent after the companies topped quarterly profit estimates and raised their full-year earnings forecasts. Coca-Cola was up 1.2 percent after its revenue beat estimates, helped by higher demand for Coke Zero Sugar and new flavors of Diet Coke. Verizon gained 3 percent after its profit beat expectations. Earnings have been a bright spot, diverting attention from geopolitical and trade worries and, lately, a jump in 10-year U.S. government bond yields. About 18 percent of S&P; 500 companies have reported first-quarter results as of Monday, with 78 percent topping profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Strong reports have pushed up analysts’ estimates for the quarter’s earnings growth to nearly 20 percent, from 18.6 percent at the start of the earnings season, the strongest in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. At 7:47 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 155 points, or 0.63 percent. S&P; 500 e-minis were up 15.5 points, or 0.58 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 36.75 points, or 0.55 percent. One dampener was Google-parent Alphabet, which dipped 0.5 percent after its profit beat Wall Street estimates but its costs rose. Not all results from Dow components were strong. Travelers fell 2 percent after the insurer’s profit missed estimates. 3M fell 3.2 percent after its results. Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. bonds were 2.9715 percent. They came within striking distance of 3 percent on Monday due to a growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation as commodity prices gained. Oil rose above $75 a barrel to its highest since November 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts, strong demand and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran.

925,UTX,Exclusive: UTC set to win EU approval for $23 billion Rockwell Collins deal - sources,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is set to win EU approval for the largest aerospace deal in history, a $23 billion bid for avionics maker Rockwell Collins (COL.N), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The deal, announced in September last year, would create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing (BA.N), Airbus (AIR.PA), Bombardier (BBDb.TO) and other plane makers. The takeover would give UTC, maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, more leverage to resist pressure from plane makers seeking price cuts. Rockwell Collins’ software capability would also give UTC an edge in data crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail. UTC has offered to sell assets to address the European Commission’s concerns, the people said, declining to provide details. Analysts had said the deal could face a bumpier road in the EU than in the United States because of the merged company’s size and market power. The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by May 4, and UTC declined to comment. UTC cleared a hurdle last month after key client Boeing said it had provided consent to the deal after raising initial concerns. Analysts said the combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft by dollar value. A source close to Airbus had told Reuters it had concerns about the merger. Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned UTC to focus on delivering jet engines on time. Rockwell Collins’ (COL.N) businesses are in avionics, seats and plane interiors. This is the second engines-to-seating supplier deal after French jet engine maker Safran (SAF.PA) acquired seat maker Zodiac Aerospace (ZODFF.PK) last year.

926,UTX,Hedge fund Third Point pushes United Tech to break up,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb’s Third Point on Friday urged United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) to move more forcefully in pursuing a breakup into three businesses, arguing this could unlock $20 billion in value. The New York-based hedge fund, which owns a $1-billion stake in the Connecticut conglomerate, signaled to its clients that it would step up pressure on the board and management to follow through on promises to review the company’s future. Loeb wants the company to split into three businesses: the Climate, Controls & Security division, Otis elevators, and an aerospace company (“Aerospace RemainCo”) encompassing UTAS and Pratt & Whitney. It also would include Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N), which United Technologies is acquiring.  “A three‐way split would unlock in excess of $20 billion of value, net of separation costs,” Third Point said in a letter to clients seen by Reuters on Friday. “Third Point did not invest in UTC for what it is today but for what it could become,” the letter said, adding that the fund planned to work constructively with the company. United Technologies shares were up 1.5 percent at $119.50. The company said it welcomed input from shareholders but disagreed with some of the hedge fund’s points, possibly exposing areas of conflict between the two sides. Loeb said management may be dragging its heels. “UTC’s management has acknowledged the disconnect between the company’s intrinsic value and share price but it seems less open to a three‐way split solution than shareholders might expect,” the letter said. In March, UTC Chief Executive Greg Hayes put a price tag of as much as $3 billion on splitting the company apart, and said it could take two years to complete. But Loeb said on Friday it could be done for less, putting the figure for refinancing debt that matures between 2020 and 2027 at around $200 million. Loeb has a history of sparring with chief executives, including those at Dow Chemical, Sotheby’s and Yahoo, and his firm’s involvement at United Technologies comes at a time when conglomerates are fighting to justify their existence. Hayes has told investors several times that United Technologies plans to conduct a portfolio review that will include considering a three-way breakup, if appropriate, to unlock value for shareholders. People familiar with United Tech’s thinking say executives currently need to concentrate on closing its $30-billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins, which it agreed last year, and that focusing on a breakup now could be a distraction. Loeb is not the only activist investor in United Tech. Earlier this year, William Ackman said his Pershing Square Capital Management was also invested. So far, Ackman, an often-voluble investor, has said nothing about the company.
