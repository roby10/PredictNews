1,KMI,UPDATE 2-Oiltanking Partners prices IPO above range," * IPO price of $21.50 above range of $19-$21 per unit   * Initial market capitalization set to be above $850 mln   * Banking on growing storage demand as US oil shales boom   * Backed by aviation fuel/oil concern Marquard & Bahls  (Adds background on company, comparable IPO)   SAN FRANCISCO, July 13 (Reuters) - Oil terminal and storage services provider Oiltanking Partners LP priced its initial public offering of 10 million units at $21.50 each, above the $19-$21 range it had proposed.   That raises $215 million before fees, and the IPO underwriters can still buy up to another 1.5 million common units. The Houston-based company had already increased the size of its IPO late last month. [ID:nL3E7HN1H2]   The company is banking on the need for Gulf Coast refiners to handle growing volumes of shale oil from North Dakota and Texas, boosting demand for its storage capacity of 17.8 million barrels at Houston and Beaumont, two terminals where it has said another 12.4 million barrels of capacity could be added.   Its general partner is owned by Oiltanking Holding Americas Inc, a subsidiary of Oiltanking GmbH, the world’s second largest independent storage provider for crude oil, refined products, liquid chemicals and gases, which plans to use its newly listed company as a vehicle for U.S. expansion.   Oiltanking GmbH, in turn, is a unit of Marquard & Bahls, a privately held German company with $5 billion in assets that trades oil and refuels planes in addition to its storage arm.   The public will own at least 25.2 percent of Oiltanking Partners LP upon conclusion of the offering, or 29 percent if the underwriters exercise their full over-allotment, indicating a market capitalization of more than $850 million.   Citigroup, Barclays, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley are the lead underwriters. The shares will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol “OILT.”   Despite the opportunities, the hydrocarbon business can be unpredicatable. Shares of Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), which both pipes and stores oil and gas, are trading below their IPO price of $30 despite a solid debut back in February.

2,KMI,IFR-30-year debt too good to refuse with Treasuries below 4%," by Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, Aug 4 (IFR) - A 30-year Treasury bond yield at under 4% was too good to refuse for five corporates this week, which have together issued $1.6bn of long-dated debt, some at record low coupons.  Southwestern Public Service Co came to market on Wednesday with a $200m 4.5% issue of 2041s, which tied for the lowest ever 30-year coupon by a corporate with Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), San Diego Gas & Electric Co and Southern Edison Electric Co.  Southwestern had followed the utility Public Service Co of Colorado, which issued $250m of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 4.75% the day before, making it the second lowest 30-year coupon on record.  Dominion Resources (D.N) also came to market when it saw it could hit a personal best with a $500m 30-year offering with a coupon of 4.9%, which market participants say is the lowest 30-year coupon seen on utility debt issued at the holding company level.  Dominion sought to take advantage of the 30-year yield trading under 4% -- on Wednesday, the 30-year yield had plunged to 3.843% by midday, its lowest since last October's 3.65%. It later closed at 3.9%, which is still about 49bp tighter than a month ago.  BBB minus-rated Lorillard Tobacco LO.N started to market a benchmark five-year bond on Monday, but added a 30-year tranche to the mix after seeing it could get significantly better pricing at the long end than it's ever received before.  The company ended up pricing a $500mn five year with a 3.5% coupon and a $250m 30-year tranche with a coupon of 7% -- about 112bp better than the coupon on a 30-year it did last year.  Two days after Lorillard, BBB-rated Kinder Morgan Energy Partners KMP.N (KMI.N) came to market with $375m of 10-year notes priced with a coupon of 4.15% and a $375m 30-year with a coupon of 5.625%.  Bankers have been telling clients all year that with rates so low it made sense to issue 30-year bonds.  But Issuers opted for the most part to stick to the intermediate and short end of the maturity spectrum, unwilling to pay the hefty price in a steep yield curve environment to issue 30-year bonds.  ""For much of this year the steepness of the curve has made it tough for corporates to stomach going out long and issuing 30-year bonds rather than shorter-dated debt at even lower rates,"" said Andrew Karp, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  ""However, at some point the absolute level of 30-year rates, regardless of the pay-up to go out the curve, becomes so attractive that it's hard to say no.""  To lock in 30-year money when absolute 30-year Treasury rates are below 4% is something many issuers know they will be able to live with for the life of the securities, even though it might have been expensive on a relative basis at the time of pricing.  TECHNICAL SUPPORT  Apart from low coupons, the technicals in the market couldn't be better.  All of this week's 30-year deals were several times oversubscribed and most offered barely anything in the way of a new issue concession.  ""For investors, it's a chance to pick up some rare 30-year corporate paper. Net supply of investment grade corporate bonds since June 1 has been very light and by some counts, it is actually negative after accounting for recent fund inflows,"" said Rob Stowe, managing director in Barclays Capital's debt capital markets group.  Stowe, who covers utilities in Barclay's DCM group, expects to see more utilities like PS Colorado and Southwestern come to market in coming weeks to take advantage of the new lows at the long end of the curve.  Karp also expects to see more 30-year issuance, and some may be driven by other factors.  ""The combination of low rates and an increase in M&A activity means that we will likely see more 30-year issuance,"" he said.

Truck racks at the terminals will be shut some time on Saturday, company spokesman Joe Hollier said.

4,KMI,"FACTBOX-US refiners cut runs, energy companies weather Irene"," Aug 28 (Reuters) - Most U.S. oil refiners, terminals and pipelines along the U.S. East Coast weathered Tropical Storm Irene, downgraded from hurricane levels early on Sunday morning, while a few shut down operations or ran at reduced rates.  Hurricane Irene proved weaker than the mammoth disaster forecasters had expected on Sunday and was downgraded to a tropical storm in the early morning hours, although it pelted New York with heavy winds and driving rain and lashed the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast with hurricane power. [ID:nN1E77R00E]  Nearly 5 million customers on the East Coast were without power after the storm passed while the U.S. Homeland Security said the worst was over for New York and New Jersey.  Colonial Pipeline said Irene’s impact on its northwestern refined oil system in southern New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia was less than expected.  The company’s mainlines in its northeastern pipeline system continued to provide full services, including at its Linden, New Jersey, facility and in the New York Harbor. [ID:nWEN7662]  Kinder Morgan (KMI.N) shut down a part of its Plantation oil products pipeline between Greensboro, North Carolina, and Washington D.C., on Sunday due to power outages in the region. [ID:nWEN7665]  Hess Corp (HES.N) said on Sunday its 70,000 barrel per day Port Reading refinery in New Jersey was back to normal operations after cutting runs as a precaution as Hurricane Irene approached. [ID:nWEN7673]  PBF energy said its New Jersey and Delaware refineries did not sustain any damages from the storm and were operating normally as of Sunday morning. [ID:nWEN7655]  ConocoPhillips’ Bayway (COP.N) refinery in New Jersey remained shut on Sunday while its Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery continued to operate. [ID:nWEN7648]  Seven refineries with a total of 1,229,200 barrels per day of refining capacity — 73 percent of the 1.7 million bpd total in the U.S. Northeast — were in the storm’s projected path.  The U.S. Northeast is the second-smallest of the five U.S. refining regions, with most of its fuel being supplied by pipeline from the Gulf Coast or tanker ship from Europe.  Unlike a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, an East Coast storm does not threaten significant U.S. crude oil and natural gas production.

5,KMI,IPO VIEW-Tech IPOs could lead the way post-Labor Day," * Investors looking to IPO market to provide growth   * Tech IPOs seen as good bet for post-Labor Day flotations   * Concerns about European debt, U.S. recovery persist   By Clare Baldwin   NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - It’s been a rough summer for U.S. initial public offerings after the stock market nosedived, but tech issues could see strong demand after bankers and fund managers return from vacation in September.   The growth promised by tech companies is dramatic and such growth is hard to come by as fears about a European debt crisis and a faltering U.S. recovery persist.   “The demand on the margin will be more for tech than for anything else,” said Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based IPO research and investment house IPOX Schuster.   Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Chicago-based Harris Private Bank, agreed. “Tech is growth,” he said.   “IPO buyers are like wildcat oil drillers,” he added. “They want a piece of everything in the hope that one of the deals works out and they get the next Google.”   Harris Private Bank has $55 billion under management.   The two biggest venture-backed tech IPOs currently in the U.S. pipeline are Zynga, the top publisher of games on Facebook which plans to raise up to $1 billion, and Groupon, which offers subscribers coupons for local businesses and plans to raise up to $750 million.   Zynga was founded in 2007. In less than three years, the company grew its revenue to nearly $600 million and turned a profit. This year it is on pace to grow its revenue even more, though if the first quarter is representative, its profit will be smaller than last year’s.   Groupon is not profitable but has also grown dramatically. Its revenue has gone from zero when it began operations in October 2008 to $1.5 billion for the first half of 2011.   The company’s business model has some question marks, including the fact that it is relatively easy for competitors to mimic it, and drive down its revenue.   Groupon and Zynga declined to comment.   Still, Internet tech IPOs look the most promising of the IPOs set to hit the market. Deals that priced earlier this year have performed well.   Professional networking site LinkedIn Corp LNKD.N posted a surprise second-quarter profit following its IPO and projected faster-than-expected 2011 revenue growth. More than three months after its blockbuster debut its shares are up nearly 80 percent above their IPO price.   Likewise, shares of real estate and housing data company Zillow Inc (Z.O) are up nearly 75 percent above their IPO price more than a month after its IPO.   A handful of tech companies are on file for smaller IPOs.   Also on file for big U.S. IPOs are a number of private equity portfolio companies and real estate companies. The success of the real estate companies will largely depend on the dividends they are able to offer. The private equity deals could struggle based on slides in the share prices of other recent buyout-backed IPOs and general investor skepticism about high debt and savvy sellers, experts said.   “Everyone knows (the PE owners) are sellers. They need a more robust environment,” said former Wall Street equity capital markets banker Bruce Foerster who now runs advisory firm South Beach Capital Markets.

9,KMI,Tech IPOs could lead the way post-Labor Day,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - It’s been a rough summer for U.S. initial public offerings after the stock market nosedived, but tech issues could see strong demand after bankers and fund managers return from vacation in September.  The growth promised by tech companies is dramatic and such growth is hard to come by as fears about a European debt crisis and a faltering U.S. recovery persist.  “The demand on the margin will be more for tech than for anything else,” said Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based IPO research and investment house IPOX Schuster.  Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Chicago-based Harris Private Bank, agreed. “Tech is growth,” he said.  “IPO buyers are like wildcat oil drillers,” he added. “They want a piece of everything in the hope that one of the deals works out and they get the next Google.”  Harris Private Bank has $55 billion under management.  The two biggest venture-backed tech IPOs currently in the U.S. pipeline are Zynga, the top publisher of games on Facebook that plans to raise up to $1 billion, and Groupon, which offers subscribers coupons for local businesses and plans to raise up to $750 million.  Zynga was founded in 2007. In less than three years, the company increased its revenue to nearly $600 million and turned a profit. This year it is on pace to increase revenue even more, though if the first quarter is representative, its profit will be smaller than last year’s.  Groupon is not profitable, but has also grown dramatically. Its revenue has gone from zero when it began operations in October 2008, to $1.5 billion for the first half of 2011.  The company’s business model has some question marks, including the fact that it is relatively easy for competitors to mimic it, and drive down its revenue.  Groupon and Zynga declined to comment.  Still, Internet tech IPOs look the most promising of the IPOs set to hit the market. Deals that priced earlier this year have performed well.  Professional networking site LinkedIn Corp LNKD.N posted a surprising second-quarter profit following its IPO and projected faster-than-expected 2011 revenue growth. More than three months after its blockbuster debut its shares are up nearly 80 percent above their IPO price.  Likewise, shares of real estate and housing data company Zillow Inc (Z.O) are up nearly 75 percent above their IPO price more than a month after its IPO.  A handful of tech companies are on file for smaller IPOs.  Also on file for big U.S. IPOs are a number of private equity portfolio companies and real estate companies.

11,KMI,Kinder Morgan to buy El Paso for $21 billion,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc struck a $21 billion deal to buy rival El Paso Corp, combining the two largest North American natural gas pipeline companies and making a big bet on the fast-growing market for that fuel. Despite weak natural gas prices, production of the fuel has been rising as energy companies pile into shale fields — underground formations rich in oil and gas. El Paso already owned the largest natural gas pipeline system in North America, with more than 43,000 miles of pipelines. The combined company would own 67,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and another 13,000 miles of pipelines to move refined products and other fuels, Kinder Morgan said on Sunday. “We believe that natural gas is going to play an increasingly integral role in North America,” Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Richard Kinder said in a statement. “We are delighted to be able to significantly expand our natural gas transportation footprint at a time when it seems likely that domestic natural gas supply and demand will grow at attractive rates for years to come.” The offer of $26.87 a share in cash, stock and warrants, represents a 37 percent premium to El Paso’s Friday closing price of $19.59. Including El Paso’s debt, the deal tops $38 billion, making it the second biggest merger in 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data. The deal derails El Paso’s plan, announced in May, to split into two publicly traded companies, which would have separated its exploration and production business from its pipeline operations. Kinder Morgan said it plans to sell El Paso’s exploration and production assets. John White, an analyst at Houston-based Triple Double Advisors, said the deal makes perfect sense for both companies. “El Paso has the largest natural gas pipeline in North America — it’s a tremendous and premium set of assets,” said White, who helps to manage a portfolio of energy equities, MLPs and bonds. “They are doing this deal at a nice premium.” Kinder Morgan is buying El Paso as companies including Exxon Mobil Corp and others are spending billions of dollars to develop shale gas and crude oil exploration and production in areas that are constrained by infrastructure. For example, in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas where there are scant pipelines, companies are having to rely on trucks and are building rail terminals to handle the vast field’s output. Oil and gas producers could have to pay up to ship their gas on Kinder Morgan’s pipelines if they are dealing with one behemoth, rather than two smaller pipeline companies. That could hit the bottom line for end users like power companies. The combined company’s pipelines will be connected to natural gas shales including the Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Utica, Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett. Houston-based pipeline company Kinder Morgan raised $2.86 billion in February in an IPO valuing the firm at more than $21 billion. The company’s market capitalization as of Friday was around $19 billion. The offer per share comprises $14.65 in cash, 0.4187 Kinder Morgan shares — valued at $11.26 per EP share — and 0.640 Kinder Morgan warrants — valued at $0.96 per EP share — based on Kinder Morgan’s closing price on Friday. The warrants will have an exercise price of $40 and a five-year term. The transaction has been approved by each company’s board the companies said. Kinder Morgan said it has a commitment letter from Barclays Capital underwriting the full amount of cash required for the transaction. The new company hopes to generate $350 million a year in cost savings, or about 5 percent of the combined companies’ earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization. Kinder Morgan expects to be able to increase its dividend after the deal closes due to these savings. It said that if the deal were to close at the beginning of 2012, it would expect to be able to pay a dividend of about $1.45 a share that year. But because it expects the deal to close later, it said its dividend will likely be slightly below that target. The new combined company will be 68 percent owned by Kinder Morgan shareholders with El Paso holders owning the remaining 32 percent. Evercore Partners and Barclays Capital advised Kinder Morgan on the deal, while Morgan Stanley advised El Paso. Goldman Sachs acted as an adviser to El Paso on its previously announced spin-off and related matters to the Kinder Morgan deal, the companies said. The advisors are set to rake in a total of $100 million to $145 million in M&A; fees, according to Freeman & Co.",10162011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kindermorgan/kinder-morgan-to-buy-el-paso-for-21-billion-idUSTRE79F20Y20111016

13,KMI,Kinder Morgan deal a fee bonanza for banks,"(Reuters) - The investment banks advising on Kinder Morgan Inc’s $21 billion purchase of El Paso Corp are set to rake in a total of $100 million to $145 million in M&A; fees, according to Freeman & Co on Sunday. Evercore Partners and Barclays Capital, which are advising Kinder Morgan on the deal, would earn $45 million to $65 million in fees, Freeman estimates show. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which are on El Paso’s side, would split another $55 million to $80 million in fees, depending on the role they played, the estimates show. Kinder Morgan’s bid includes $9.6 billion in equity, $11.5 billion of cash and the assumption of $16.7 billion of debt for a total of $37.8 billion. Including debt, this would be the second largest M&A; transaction of the year, after AT&T; Inc’s $39 billion deal to buy Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA. The deal comes despite a broad slowdown since this summer in the M&A; market, which has been hit by global economic uncertainty, the European debt crisis and market volatility. It shows that companies are still willing to make big bets to cut costs and grow revenue, and banks are ready to aggressively use their balance sheet for large deals. Kinder Morgan hopes the deal will generate $350 million a year in cost savings, or about 5 percent of the combined companies’ earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization. Barclays Capital is underwriting the financing for the cash portion of the transaction, which will create the largest pipeline company in North America. Barclays would also earn fees for its financing role. Typical underwriting fees are around 0.5 percent to 0.8 percent of the amount financed in a syndicated loan, according to Freeman. The deal is expected to help the boutique investment bank Evercore move up one spot to No. 11 in the worldwide rankings of deal advisers, according to Thomson Reuters data. Barclays will move to No. 7 from No. 8 spot, while Goldman and Morgan Stanley will retain the No. 1 and No. 2 positions globally, the data shows.

15,KMI,Regulators to scrutinize Kinder-El Paso deal,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc’s (KMI.N) planned purchase of El Paso Corp EP.N to create the largest U.S. natural gas pipeline network will receive a close look from U.S. regulators, who may require substantial pipeline divestitures. The $21 billion merger will almost certainly receive heavy scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission, which traditionally reviews large natural gas pipeline mergers, according to antitrust experts. The companies’ pipelines in the Rocky Mountains will be a key focus for the FTC, experts said. “When you look at overlap today, there is some in the Rocky Mountains,” said Carl Kirst, analyst at BMO capital markets, predicting that the FTC will approve the deal. “Maybe they have to sell one pipeline.” The combined company will be a pipeline juggernaut with the ability to deliver massive amounts of crude oil and natural gas over 80,000 miles of pipe stretching from coast to coast, and could demand higher transport fees from oil and gas producers. Kinder Morgan’s chief executive, Rich Kinder, said on Monday he believes the merger will be approved, but he acknowledged some areas where the companies’ pipeline networks overlap. “We certainly anticipate we will obviously have to comply with the regulator, in this case, the (U.S. Federal Trade Commission), and we’ll work with them to satisfy whatever their concerns are; but we don’t see that as a major obstacle and we do expect to close, we’re thinking, in the second quarter of next year,” Kinder told investors on a conference call. Kinder said his company would work with the FTC to address any issues raised about overlapping pipeline networks. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates the interstate natural gas pipelines owned by Kinder Morgan and El Paso, but will not review the merger, an agency spokeswoman said. While the FTC will closely examine the merger, it is likely that the deal will ultimately be allowed to move forward, said Bruce McDonald, a former Justice Department deputy assistant attorney general now at Jones Day law firm. “Some divestitures may be required but it seems unlikely that the entire deal will be blocked,” he said. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, the biggest individual holder of El Paso’s stock, said he expects the FTC to approve the deal. “I think the deal goes through,” Icahn told the CNBC television network. If the FTC determines that the merger would harm competition in these overlapping areas, the companies could be forced to sell some of these assets. “If they wind up being in a dominant position because of a merger in those areas, the solution would be to divest one of their pipelines,” said Andrew Gavil, a professor at the Howard University School of Law. The companies seem to be hinting that there could be some competitive issues by acknowledging publicly that there are areas of overlap, Gavil said. “They understand there are antitrust issues upfront, otherwise you don’t publicly negotiate against yourself,” he said. “What they’re signaling is they’re willing to negotiate a deal that would address any antitrust concerns.” As part of the planned deal, Kinder plans to sell El Paso’s exploration and production assets, valued by analysts at roughly $8 billion to $9 billion. That deal is expected to close in the second quarter and proceeds will be applied to acquisition debt, Kinder told investors. El Paso’s exploration and production business, which includes assets in the hot Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, is valued at $9.2 billion, according to analysts at Houston investment energy bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. The deal derails El Paso’s plan, announced in May, to split into two publicly traded companies, which would have separated its exploration and production business from its pipeline operations. Kinder Morgan said it plans to sell the exploration and production assets as soon as it is practical — possibly at the same time as the deal’s closing. “We would anticipate that we will sell it for cash to third parties and our preference would obviously be to sell it as a whole,” Kinder said on the conference call. Kinder acknowledged that the assets may command a better price by selling them off in pieces. The company’s assets include positions in the Eagle Ford, Wolfcamp and Haynesville shales, as well as assets in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Brazil. “The combination Haynesville, Eagle Ford, and oil properties reminded us of another E&P; company that is no more — PetroHawk,” Tudor Pickering analyst Brad Olsen said in a research note, referring to the oil and gas company bought by BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) (BLT.L) for more than $12 billion in August. Investment bankers said that a cash deal of that size would rule out all but the largest independent oil and gas companies — like Apache Corp (APA.N), Anadarko (APC.N) or Devon (DVN.N) — and the integrated oil and gas companies. Shares of El Paso closed up nearly 25 percent at $24.45 on Monday, and shares of Kinder Morgan closed up nearly 5 percent at $28.19, after climbing above $29 earlier in the day.

17,KMI,Kinder Morgan to buy El Paso for $21 billion,"NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) struck a $21 billion deal to buy rival El Paso Corp EP.N, combining the two largest natural gas pipeline operators in North America in a huge bet on the fast-growing market for that fuel. The cash and stock deal announced on Sunday values El Paso at a 37 percent premium to its Friday market value, and comes as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and other oil majors are spending billions of dollars to develop and produce shale gas and crude oil in areas with poor infrastructure. The combined El Paso and Kinder Morgan would own about 80,000 miles of pipe stretching from coast to coast, and could demand higher transport fees from oil and gas producers, which could then raise the prices that power companies and other end users pay for gas. “Now that KMP is by far the biggest pipeline distributor of natural gas, that will also give them pricing power over the market, which could lead to price pressure to the upside for natural gas,” said Chris Jarvis, president and founder of Caprock Risk Management in Rye, New Hampshire. “We expect this to have a positive impact on the natural gas markets, likely setting the stage for addition mergers and acquisitions in the space.” It was not immediately clear how regulators would view the deal. Kinder Morgan said it expected the deal to close in early 2012. Despite weak natural gas prices, production of the fuel has been rising as energy companies pile into shale fields — underground formations rich in oil and gas. In the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, where there are scant pipelines, companies are having to rely on trucks and are building rail terminals to handle the vast field’s output. El Paso already owned the largest natural gas pipeline system in North America, with more than 43,000 miles of pipe. The combined company would own 67,000 miles of natural gas pipe and another 13,000 miles of pipelines to move refined products and other fuels. “We believe that natural gas is going to play an increasingly integral role in North America,” Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Richard Kinder said in a statement. “We are delighted to be able to significantly expand our natural gas transportation footprint at a time when it seems likely that domestic natural gas supply and demand will grow at attractive rates for years to come.” Kinder Morgan went public in February after CEO Kinder and private equite partners including Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Goldman Sachs Inc’s (GS.N) buyout arm Highstar Capital and Riverstone Holdings took the company private in a management led buyout in 2007. The private equity firms sold a 13.5 percent stake in the company’s IPO, but Kinder and the buyout funds still hold a vast majority of the company. SPLIT-UP DERAILED The deal derails El Paso’s plan, announced in May, to split into two publicly traded companies, which would have separated its exploration and production business from its pipeline operations. Kinder Morgan said it plans to sell El Paso’s exploration and production assets. The $26.87 per share offer consists of $14.65 in cash, 0.4187 Kinder Morgan shares — valued at $11.26 per EP share — and 0.640 Kinder Morgan warrants — valued at $0.96 per EP share — based on Kinder Morgan’s closing price on Friday. The warrants will have an exercise price of $40 and a five-year term. Including El Paso’s debt, the deal tops $38 billion, making it the second biggest merger in 2011 behind AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) $39 billion deal to buy Deutsche Telekom’s (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile USA, according to Thomson Reuters data. Kinder Morgan said it has a commitment letter from Barclays Capital underwriting the $11.5 billion in cash required for the transaction. The deal also highlights the advantages that energy infrastructure companies have gained in recent years by using a financial structure known as master limited partnerships (MLPs), which pay no corporate taxes but distribute the lion’s share of their profits to invsetors and the general partner through dividends. Companies like Kinder Morgan — which owns nearly all of its assets through its MLP, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners KMP.N — have a tax advantage over their competitors and have also received higher valuations from investors. This gives it a financial leg up over a company like El Paso, which still holds a substantial amount of its assets outside of its MLP, El Paso Pipeline Partners. EPB.N Tudor Pickering analyst Brad Olsen said that the takeover mirrors Energy Transfer Equity’s (ETE.N) more than $5 billion deal for pipeline company Southern Union. SUG.N “It’s not a coincidence at all that the two big pipeline deals done this year have been by big MLPs with decelerating growth. Their general partners have gone out and snagged undervalued pipeline assets,” Olsen said. Moreover, Kinder Morgan said it plans to pay down much of the substantial amount of debt it is picking up from the takeover by selling off El Paso’s assets to its MLPs. The new company hopes to generate $350 million a year in cost savings, or about 5 percent of the combined companies’ earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization. Kinder Morgan expects to be able to increase its dividend after the deal closes due to these savings. It said that if the deal were to close at the beginning of 2012, it would expect to be able to pay a dividend of about $1.45 a share that year. But because it expects the deal to close later, it said its dividend will likely be slightly below that target. Evercore Partners (EVR.N) and Barclays Capital (BARC.L) advised Kinder Morgan on the deal, while Morgan Stanley (MS.N) advised El Paso. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) acted as an adviser to El Paso on its previously announced spin-off and related matters to the Kinder Morgan deal, the companies said. The advisors are set to rake in a total of $100 million to $145 million in M&A; fees, according to Freeman & Co.",10172011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kindermorgan/kinder-morgan-to-buy-el-paso-for-21-billion-idUSTRE79F20Y20111017
18,KMI,El Paso option bets were seen before merger bid,"(Reuters) - Some lucky players may have reaped a tidy windfall with El Paso’s EP.N bullish options after Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) unveiled a $21 billion takeover bid. The call buying in the stock appears to have been well-timed but not indicative of insider trading, according to one analyst. A number of investors bought calls granting them the right to buy El Paso shares at $17, $19 and $21 apiece by November 18 expiration ahead of the merger announcement made on Sunday. El Paso shares late on Monday rose more than 25 percent to $24.56. “The call buying in the November contract in the days and weeks leading up to the deal has certainly worked out for some traders who have seen the value of their positions rise substantially,” said Interactive Brokers Group options analyst Caitlin Duffy. “While they are well-timed, the activity did not look suspicious,” she said. Kinder Morgan on Sunday announced the $21 billion deal to buy El Paso Corp, combining the two largest natural gas pipeline operators in North America in a huge bet on the fast-growing market for the natural gas. The offer of $26.87 per share in cash, shares and warrants, represents a 37 percent premium over the $19.59 closing price of El Paso stock on Friday. Duffy said the huge rally in El Paso’s shares overnight resulted in massive profits on paper for some investors who had picked up November calls over the past few weeks. Investors often turn to calls hoping to profit on a stock price rise. The number of outstanding positions in El Paso’s November $17 strike calls suggests one or more traders purchased around 1,250 contracts at that strike for an average premium of $1.49 each on September 26, Duffy said. Those calls cost nearly five times that amount at $7.25 per contract late on Monday. More recently, Duffy said about 1,600 EP calls were likely purchased at the November $19 strike on Friday at an average premium of $1.35 apiece. The contracts on Monday were trading on average at $5.20, a potential 280 percent return, according to Trade Alert. At the November $21 EP call strike, open interest suggests traders picked up roughly 1,000 contracts for an average premium of 32 cents each at the end of last week. The premium required to buy the November $21 call on Monday was 10 times that amount at around a $3.50 a contract, Duffy said. On September 26, an options combination was initiated in El Paso and involved the purchase of 5,000 November $18 calls and the sale of 5,000 November $15 puts, resulting in a net cost of 29 cents, according to data from Chicago website optionMonster. The shares traded at $17.03 at the time of the posting. A call purchase and a put sale are a “simulated” long position in a stock. The trade paid off. “Total premium for the investor for the original trade was $145,000, and now it has a potential worth of $3.7 million,” said optionMonster co-founder Jon Najarian. “I believe it does bear scrutiny.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which looks into unusual stock and option trading, declined to comment.

21,KMI,UPDATE 5-Kinder Morgan to buy El Paso for $21 bln,"* Offer includes cash, shares and warrants * Transaction expected to close in Q2 2012 * Combined company to generate $350 mln in cost savings By Michael Erman and Anna Driver NEW YORK/HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc  struck a $21 billion deal to buy rival El Paso Corp  , combining the two largest natural gas pipeline operators in North America in a huge bet on the fast-growing market for that fuel. The cash and stock deal announced on Sunday values El Paso at a 37 percent premium to its Friday market value, and comes as Exxon Mobil Corp and other oil majors are spending billions of dollars to develop and produce shale gas and crude oil in areas with poor infrastructure. The combined El Paso and Kinder Morgan would own about 80,000 miles of pipe stretching from coast to coast, and could demand higher transport fees from oil and gas producers, which could then raise the prices that power companies and other end users pay for gas. “Now that KMP is by far the biggest pipeline distributor of natural gas, that will also give them pricing power over the market, which could lead to price pressure to the upside for natural gas,” said Chris Jarvis, president and founder of Caprock Risk Management in Rye, New Hampshire. “We expect this to have a positive impact on the natural gas markets, likely setting the stage for addition mergers and acquisitions in the space.” It was not immediately clear how regulators would view the deal. Kinder Morgan said it expected the deal to close in early 2012. Despite weak natural gas prices , production of the fuel has been rising as energy companies pile into shale fields — underground formations rich in oil and gas. In the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, where there are scant pipelines, companies are having to rely on trucks and are building rail terminals to handle the vast field’s output. El Paso already owned the largest natural gas pipeline system in North America, with more than 43,000 miles of pipe. The combined company would own 67,000 miles of natural gas pipe and another 13,000 miles of pipelines to move refined products and other fuels. “We believe that natural gas is going to play an increasingly integral role in North America,” Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Richard Kinder said in a statement. “We are delighted to be able to significantly expand our natural gas transportation footprint at a time when it seems likely that domestic natural gas supply and demand will grow at attractive rates for years to come.” Kinder Morgan went public in February after CEO Kinder and private equite partners including Carlyle Group and Goldman Sachs Inc’s buyout arm Highstar Capital and Riverstone Holdings took the company private in a management led buyout in 2007. The private equity firms sold a 13.5 percent stake in the company’s IPO, but Kinder and the buyout funds still hold a vast majority of the company. SPLIT-UP DERAILED The deal derails El Paso’s plan, announced in May, to split into two publicly traded companies, which would have separated its exploration and production business from its pipeline operations.

22,KMI,HOW TO PLAY IT: Extracting value from pipeline deals,"ISSUE: The $21 billion Kinder Morgan acquisition of El Paso suggests value in the pipeline sector. By Rodrigo Campos Oct 18 (Reuters) -  Kinder Morgan’s deal to acquire El Paso will create the largest pipeline company in North America. The news sent a flurry of cash into smaller pipeline companies considered targets. But for most investors the natural gas sector is best looked at as an income source, not quick takeover profits, analysts say. Some may be lucky enough to cash in on stocks of unnoticed pipeline companies. But there are other options: Utilities and master limited partnerships (MLP) and ETFs that track them also could benefit from U.S. energy demand, analysts say. Analysts expect more deals among pipeline and natural gas companies, as well as utilities. Major oil companies producing shale gas and crude oil in areas with poor infrastructure need ways to get better access to consumer markets. “We’ve already seen a tremendous amount of M&A; activity with both the Kinder Morgan announcement and ... the Energy Transfer transaction as well,” said Dan Spears, partner at Swank Capital in Dallas. Energy Transfer Partners LP  said Monday it would sell its propane operations to AmeriGas Partners LP for $2.8 billion. “It underscores the need for continued investment in the energy infrastructure sector,” Spears said. Companies with pipeline assets which also have significant yield include Atlas Pipeline Partners , up more than 30 percent so far in 2011 with a dividend yield of 5.82 percent. MLPs AND THEIR TRACKING ETFs Master limited partnerships have been around for years but interest has grown in reliable yield, especially with other income products growing harder to find. The Kinder Morgan and El Paso deal underscores the solid income prospects for natural gas MLPs. The asset class is “a great source for companies investing in the energy infrastructure space” according to Swank Capital’s Spears. The fact that the assets underlying the business model are pipelines and storage facilities makes them a sound investment, he added. Jason Stevens, analyst at Morningstar in Columbus, Ohio, said MLPs, as a whole, are attractive “because of yield and growth and cash flow stability.” Underscoring their recent popularity, JPMorgan started coverage last Friday of U.S. MLPs with a positive view. MarkWest Energy Partners , up almost 8 percent this year and with a dividend yield at 6 percent, is one MLP that is already working for investors. Some analysts question whether it’s too late to jump in. But the dividends remain attractive and more deals could emerge, Stevens said. Another option: Exchange-traded funds tracking MLPs, including Alerian MLP ETF —with a projected yield above 6 percent according to Thomson Reuters data — and the Credit Suisse Cushing 30 MLP Index ETF . Many investors have been expecting further consolidation in utilities for years, or at least more sales of pipeline assets that utilities own. Think NiSource , a natural gas and energy utility with more than 15,000 miles of pipelines. It’s up almost 28 percent year-to-date and has a dividend yield above 4 percent. Another, Dominion Resources , is up more than 18 percent this year and offers a dividend yield of close to 4 percent. “For years midstream operators have been trying to buy up those assets but they’ve not come to market at a price that utilities are willing to part with them,” said Morningstar’s Stevens. Investors have the luxury of being paid a dividend while they wait to see if any value-enhancing takeovers take place. “Utility allocation makes all the sense in the world and it is one of the only places where you can also get yield,” said Christian Wagner, chief investment officer at Longview Capital Management in Wilmington, Delaware. He said a way to get dividend yield and capital appreciation is the Rydex S&P; Equal Weight Utilities ETF . It’s up about 3 percent in value this year and has a projected yield of near 3.5 percent. “You get a lower dividend yield with RYU versus XLU (the utilities SPDR ETF ),” Wagner said. But,”the upside is better” for those seeking capital appreciation, he said. The fracking boom is another area to mine opportunity said Shawn Hackett, the president of Hackett advisors in Boynton Beach, Florida. The extraction method relies on hydraulics to reach hard-to-mine natural gas from pockets in the earth. His long-standing call: Water-services company Heckmann Corp . The water disposal company’s stock is up more than 14 percent this year. “If you’re going to be fracking you’re going to have to have a plan of how you’re going to dispose of the water,” Hackett said. He said authorities are concerned about the environmentally-safe handling of water used in the process. “If you don’t do that they’re not going to let you drill.”",10182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/howtoplayit-natgasma/how-to-play-it-extracting-value-from-pipeline-deals-idUSN1E79H1LT20111018

30,KMI,El Paso shareholders sue Goldman over Kinder deal,"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) was sued by shareholders of El Paso Corp EP.N for advising the company’s board to abandon a spin-off and instead sell itself cheaply to Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), a deal that benefited Goldman Sachs. Kinder Morgan reached a deal this week to buy El Paso for $21 billion in cash, stock and warrants, combining the two largest natural gas operators in North America. While El Paso shareholders received a 37 percent premium to its market close prior to the deal, numerous shareholders have sued over the inclusion of warrants to pay for the deal and what they consider a low valuation, among other issues. Goldman Sachs was sued in Delaware’s Chancery Court for its conflict of advising the board to accept a “low-premium” deal with Kinder Morgan, in which Goldman Sachs owns nearly 20 percent. As part of the Kinder Morgan deal, El Paso also abandoned a previously announced a plan to spin off its exploration and production business to shareholders. “Goldman Sachs earned larger advisory fees than if El Paso had consummated the spin-off, and Goldman Sachs stands to see its 20 percent investment in Kinder Morgan increase in value,” said the complaint. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The lawsuit by a retirement fund for Louisiana police also names as defendants Kinder Morgan and the board of El Paso and seeks an injunction to block the closing of the deal.

Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC  is among the other companies in talks for the unit, which is estimated to be worth $8.1 billion by analysts at BNP Paribas, it said. U.S. regulators last month made a second request for information about Kinder Morgan Inc’s planned $21 billion takeover of El Paso, first announced in October, in a deal that will combine the two largest natural gas pipeline companies. As part of the deal, Kinder plans to sell El Paso’s E&P; assets to help finance the acquisition. The deal is expected to close by the second quarter of 2012. Reliance is yet to decide whether to make a bid for the unit, Bloomberg reported. A Reliance spokesman said the company does not comment on speculation. Officials for Kinder Morgan and El Paso could not be immediately reached. Last month, a senior Reliance executive told Reuters the company is scouting for oil investments in the Americas as it looks to boost the share of its crude production to feed its huge refinery in western India.

39,KMI,El Paso shareholders seek to block vote on merger,"WILMINGTON, Del, Feb 9 (Reuters) - El Paso Corp’s  chief executive tainted the company’s proposed $21 billion sale to rival oil pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc  by not disclosing his personal interest in acquiring certain El Paso assets, El Paso shareholders argued on Thursday. They told a Delaware chancery court that these alleged conflicts of interest, plus those of deal adviser Goldman Sachs Group Inc, so badly marred the merger that the court should block a shareholder vote scheduled for next month. Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine described the alleged conflicts as “disturbing” but appeared to reject the idea of  enjoining a shareholder vote. Instead he said he could let shareholders decide if they wanted to approve the deal and allow them to sue for damages caused by the conflicts. Strine, who said he would soon decide whether to enjoin the vote, also pointed out the damage that shareholders would suffer if he blocked the deal, since that could prompt Kinder Morgan to walk away and El Paso’s stock might tank. “You want me to enjoin the stink, but only until June 30 and then you still get the stink,” said Strine. El Paso agreed in October to be acquired for $26.87 per share in cash, stock and warrants, combining the two largest natural gas pipeline operators in North America. As part of the Kinder Morgan deal, El Paso also abandoned a previously announced plan to spin off its exploration and production business to shareholders. Mark Lebovitch, a lawyer for El Paso shareholders, told Strine an injunction against the deal would give El Paso’s management a chance to consider the breakup and sale of the company’s assets, which could bring more money  stockholders. Strine, the court’s chief judge, did most of the talking during the six-hour hearing, pressing lawyers for El Paso, Kinder Morgan and Goldman Sachs to explain the motives of key players in the deal. Lebovitch said that El Paso’s chief executive and the main negotiator for the company, Douglas Foshee, might have had an interest in depressing the price of his company because he hoped to cut a side deal to buy unwanted assets from Kinder Morgan. “The principle negotiator has a conflict that’s not disclosed,” said Strine. “This is a very unusual pattern of negotiation.” El Paso’s attorney said shareholders were basing their accusations against Foshee on little more than his musings. Goldman Sachs also appeared to have conflicting motives, the shareholders said: It collected a $20 million fee as a financial adviser to El Paso, while also holding a 19 percent stake in Kinder Morgan. For every dollar shaved off the price Kinder Morgan agreed to pay for El Paso’s stock, the shareholders said, Goldman made $150 million on its investment in Kinder Morgan. In addition, although Goldman did only minimal work on the deal, the bank still expected to collect its fee, El Paso’s attorney said. Strine suggested Goldman surrender its compensation. That suggestion was swiftly rejected by Goldman’s attorney, who also denied there was any conflict. Shares of El Paso closed up 0.8 percent at $27.32 while shares of Kinder Morgan climbed 1.8 percent to $32.64.",2092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/elpaso-kindermorgan/el-paso-shareholders-seek-to-block-vote-on-merger-idUSL2E8D9JQE20120209

41,KMI,Canadian oil pipeline squeeze extends into March,"* Enbridge, Kinder Morgan apportion lines moving Canada oil * Tight pipe space a factor behind deep crude discounts * New pipeline projects several years away CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Canadian oil producers face another month of tight pipeline capacity leading out of Alberta, a key factor cited for bargain-basement discounts for their output, which has cut into corporate earnings over the past two months. Enbridge Inc and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners , which run the three of the four major crude pipeline systems from Alberta, had to ration space for March after volumes nominated by their shippers exceeded capacity, in some cases by wide margins. Companies face smaller than hoped for shipments on Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline system to Vancouver and Washington state from Alberta, the downstream leg of its Express-Platte system to southern Illinois, and on Enbridge’s Line 5 to Sarnia, Ontario, from Superior, Wisconsin. The restrictions, known as apportionment, come at a time of rising production from Canada’s oil sands and producers and analysts say it highlights the need for increased pipeline capacity and diversified markets for the supply. Several multibillion-dollar projects have been proposed, some by Enbridge and Kinder Morgan, to increase the takeaway capacity, but they face several hurdles, including opposition by environmental groups and aboriginal communities, and lengthy public hearings. They include Enbridge’s C$5.5 billion ($5.5 billion) Northern Gateway pipeline to Canada’s Pacific Coast from Alberta, a project aimed at opening up vast new markets in Asia and increasing business in California. That project is currently undergoing regulatory proceedings expected to last through 2013. On Tuesday, Kinder Morgan said it had garnered enough support from shippers to take the next step in a planned C$3.8 billion expansion of its Trans Mountain system, one that would double capacity to 600,000 barrels a day. Neither offer short-term relief for Canadian producers, however, as they would not start operations until 2017 or later. Prices for Canadian light synthetic crude tumbled this month as burgeoning supplies, an outage at a major U.S. Midwest refinery and tight pipeline space led to record discounts in the mid-$20s per barrel under benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude. This was for March delivery. April synthetic was quoted in a range of flat to $7 under WTI on Wednesday. Western Canada Select heavy blend for April had a range of $26.50-$30 a barrel under WTI, which was similar to discounts seen at the end of the trade window for March. Among the pipelines, Kinder Morgan said its Trans Mountain line was overbooked by 69.4 percent for March, meaning shippers would be able to move just 30.6 percent of nominated volumes. The line serves refineries in Vancouver, northwestern Washington and an export terminal in Vancouver’s harbor. Its 280,000 bpd Express Pipeline to Wyoming from Alberta is not apportioned for March, but just 19 percent of nominated volumes will flow on the downstream leg of that system, the Platte pipeline to Wood River, Illinois, from Wyoming. Enbridge’s 491,000 bpd Line 5, which serves refineries in Michigan and southern Ontario, will move 73 percent of nominated volumes next month, the company said.

The Apollo and Riverstone group includes billionaire Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries and other parties, El Paso said in a statement. Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) is selling off the business, which it would have picked up as part of its $21 billion deal to buy rival El Paso late last year. Because Kinder Morgan was only interested in El Paso’s pipeline assets, it promptly put the E&P; business on the block, hoping to use proceeds from the sale to reduce the cost of the original deal. Private equity firms have flooded the U.S. oil and gas sector with billions of dollars in recent years, buying assets from energy firms thirsty for capital to help them drill in expensive and challenging areas. Last year’s second-largest leveraged buyout came from the energy space, as a consortium lead by private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) paid $7.2 billion for privately held oil and gas group Samson Investment Co. The deal provides a jump start to what has been a slow year for leveraged buyouts. Private equity-backed mergers and acquitions totaled $15.9 billion worldwide year-to-date before the deal was announced, a 33 percent decline year-on-year, according to Thomson Reuters data.

43,KMI,Apollo-led group to pay about $7.15 billion for El Paso assets,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A consortium led by private equity firm Apollo Global Management (APO.N) struck a deal to acquire El Paso Corp’s EP.N oil and gas exploration and production business for about $7.15 billion, in the largest leveraged buyout deal of the year so far. The Apollo group also includes private equity firm Riverstone Holdings, billionaire Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries and other parties, El Paso said in a statement on Friday. Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) is selling off the business, which it would have picked up as part of its $21 billion deal to buy rival El Paso late last year. Because Kinder Morgan was only interested in El Paso’s pipeline assets, it promptly put the E&P; business on the block, hoping to use proceeds from the sale to reduce the cost of the original deal. The Apollo deal is contingent on the completion of the Kinder Morgan, El Paso deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter. The $7.15 billion price tag is lower than many expected when Kinder Morgan agreed to buy El Paso in October. Analysts had projected then that the unit could be worth over $8 billion. According to one source familiar with the matter, bidding on the unit opened at around $7.5 billion. But natural gas prices have fallen more than 30 percent since October to $2.55 per million British thermal units, driving down the value of the unit. El Paso’s oil and gas assets include acreage in the Eagle Ford field of south Texas, one of the most lucrative producing areas in the country, as well as the Haynesville shale in Louisiana and stakes in offshore Brazil fields and in Egypt. Kinder Morgan and El Paso also explored a piecemeal sale process for the exploration and production business. But the private equity consortium believes that it had the upper hand because of possible tax losses and other closing risks that would arise in a piecemeal process, two sources familiar with the situation said. Private equity firms have flooded the U.S. oil and gas sector with billions of dollars in recent years, buying assets from energy firms thirsty for capital to help them drill in expensive and challenging areas.

Apollo, whose investments include casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp CRZ.O, chemicals company LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB.N) and real estate investor Realogy Corp, was co-founded by former Drexel Burnham Lambert bankers Leon Black in 1990. “In natural resources there is an extraordinary arbitrage going on right now between the pricing of physical assets and what they are trading at in the markets so there are opportunities to buy proven reserves,” Black told a private equity conference in San Francisco earlier this month. “You can use sophisticated hedging techniques and lock in very attractive returns,” he said. The buyers have already arranged for $5.5 billion in financing for the El Paso assets, two other sources who are familiar with the financing arrangements said. Citi and J.P.

But the judge admonished some of the participants in the deal, which included Goldman Sachs Group Inc, whom disgruntled El Paso shareholders accused of a conflict of interest that they said resulted in undervaluing El Paso’s shares. “I reluctantly deny the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction,” Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine wrote on Wednesday. “El Paso stockholders should not be deprived of the chance to decide for themselves about the merger, despite the disturbing nature of some of the behavior leading to its terms.” The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, the companies have said. El Paso shareholders are scheduled to vote on the proposed acquisition on March 6. Kinder Morgan has already reached an agreement to sell El Paso’s exploration and production assets for $7.15 billion to a private consortium led by Apollo Global Management LLC. Shareholders had sued to stop the Kinder-El Paso deal, arguing that Goldman Sachs Group, El Paso’s adviser, and El Paso Chief Executive Douglas Foshee both had interests in holding down the price for El Paso shares. Goldman Sachs owns 19.1 percent of Kinder Morgan and the shareholders said that, for every dollar shaved off the acquisition price of El Paso’s shares, Goldman Sachs’ private equity business saved $150 million. Goldman argued that it managed the appearance of conflicts by having its directors recuse themselves from Kinder Morgan board meetings addressing the deal. It also brought in Morgan Stanley to advise El Paso’s board once Kinder Morgan made its bid. Goldman and the companies said they were pleased with the judge’s decision to let the acquisition proceed, although some took issue with his critical comments. “We respect the judge’s opinion but want to be clear that we stood by our client through this process, encouraging them to get independent views from another adviser,” Goldman spokesman David Wells said in a statement. “We were also transparent with El Paso about our relationship with Kinder Morgan and the related issues.” El Paso spokeswoman Gretchen Krueger said in a statement the company believed the court made the right decision. “El Paso respectfully disagrees, however, with certain of the preliminary findings contained in the court’s opinion, and expects to have the opportunity to more fully respond to those findings in future proceedings,” he said. Kinder spokesman Larry Pierce said: “We’re gratified that the judge denied the injunction and that we can proceed with the vote of the shareholders.” Judge Strine said the plaintiffs were free to pursue damages later but that since they were not able to prove irreparable injury in the case, a damages award was not in play at this time.",3012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/elpaso-kindermorgan/update-2-kinder-morgan-el-paso-deal-clears-legal-hurdle-idUSL2E8DTEWN20120301

While shareholders can still change their votes before the meeting, the company said on Monday that about 70 percent of its outstanding shares had already been voted as of March 2. More than 98.5 percent of those shares were voted in favor of the deal, El Paso said. The company needs a majority of the votes cast in order to receive shareholder approval of the sale. Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine refused to block the sale last week, but said some of the behavior that led to the deal was disturbing. A shareholder group had sued to stop the deal, arguing that El Paso adviser Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and El Paso Chief Executive Douglas Foshee had interests in holding down the price for the company. Strine’s opinion swayed at least one investment adviser, who said he plans to vote against the deal. “When we went through (the opinion), we went ‘Holy Christ, you can’t vote in favor of something like this,’” said Greg Kinczewski, the general counsel for Marco Consulting Group. His firm manages proxy votes for clients such as union pension funds that collectively hold 2.2 million El Paso shares. There are about 770 million El Paso shares outstanding, according to Reuters data. Adam Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, said postponing the shareholder meeting will help El Paso undercut potential claims that the shareholder vote was tainted because investors did not know about the Delaware court’s criticisms. El Paso spokesman Richard Wheatley did not comment directly on whether the postponement was aimed at deflecting criticism of the voting, except to say shareholders were being given more time to consider “recent events.” He said the company was acting on the advice of its proxy counsel. El Paso shares were up 6 cents to $28.41 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

59,KMI,El Paso holders OK Kinder Morgan deal amid protests,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Amid chanting and shouts of protest at a raucous shareholder meeting, El Paso Corp EP.N investors approved the natural gas pipeline company’s $23 billion takeover by rival Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N). The vast majority of the company’s shareholders disregarded charges that El Paso’s chief executive, Douglas Foshee, and the company’s adviser, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) , had conflicts of interest that kept El Paso from getting the highest possible price. More than 95 percent of the shares voted endorsed the deal to combine the two largest natural gas pipeline operators in North America, El Paso said. Shareholders holding about 79 percent of El Paso’s outstanding shares voted on the matter. The shareholder meeting at a downtown Houston hotel was disrupted several times by protesters shouting objections to the deal. The meeting was originally scheduled for March 6 but was pushed back to give investors time to consider a recent ruling by a Delaware judge criticizing some of the deal’s participants. “This bad deal was brokered by Goldman Sachs and the winners are Goldman Sachs and Doug Foshee,” chanted one group of shareholders. “The losers are shareholders and pension funds.” The group was later removed from the meeting by security. Some El Paso shareholders had sued to stop the buyout, arguing that Goldman Sachs and Foshee had interests in holding down the price for the company. Goldman advised El Paso on the deal, even though it owns a sizable stake in Kinder Morgan through its private equity arm. Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine refused to block the deal in a ruling last week, but criticized the negotiating process as “disturbing.” El Paso shareholders can still pursue damages if they can prove they did not get a proper consideration for their shares. Goldman took steps to mitigate its conflicts in the deal, putting Foshee in the crosshairs of shareholders. “He’s got a target on his back,” said Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Widener University School of Law in Wilmington, Delaware, and an expert on the state’s law. He said the ruling found Foshee “was someone who was kind of putting his finger on the scale and in a sense playing into the interest of the buyer.” Foshee declined to comment directly on the judge’s ruling, citing ongoing litigation, but he told the shareholder meeting: “I strongly disagree with a number of matters in the opinion.” He said the Kinder Morgan deal was the most effective way to bring value to El Paso shareholders. “We got the best value available from Kinder Morgan on the transaction,” Foshee said, adding that he “personally negotiated the hardest” for shareholders. Strine disagreed in his ruling. Even though he allowed the deal to proceed, the judge wrote that Foshee hid from the board that he had approached Kinder Morgan about his interest in leading a management buyout of parts of El Paso that its suitor did not want. Strine said that Foshee might have tried to curry favor with Kinder Morgan and engaged in “velvet-glove” negotiating tactics in agreeing to accept a lower final bid than what was originally offered. The lost deal value for shareholders was around $534 million, by Strine’s analysis. Foshee almost certainly has insurance coverage that could potentially cover a judgment against him if shareholders win damages in court or forge a settlement, said Kevin LaCroix of OakBridge Insurance Services who blogs at the DandODiary.com. LaCroix compared El Paso to the litigation over the $4 billion takeover of Del Monte Foods Co by KKR and Co (KKR.N) last year. In that case, the Chancery Court temporarily blocked the deal due to a conflict of interest by Barclays, which was advising the food company while providing finance to the buyers. Barclays did not tell Del Monte’s board about the conflict, and it only came to light after shareholders sued. That deal eventually closed, and shareholders reached a settlement with Barclays and Del Monte for about $67 million after lawyers fees, one of the largest cash payments ever stemming from shareholder lawsuit challenging a merger.

62,KMI,Kinder Morgan to sell some assets for El Paso buy,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) said on Thursday it had reached a verbal agreement with regulators to sell some of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP’s KMP.N pipeline assets in order to win approval for its planned purchase of El Paso Corp EP.N. The $21 billion deal, which will close in May, had been expected to attract scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission because of the merged company’s overlapping pipeline networks. Without the divestments, the combined company would have controlled 80,000 miles of pipe stretching from coast to coast, potentially allowing it to raise transport fees from oil and gas producers, which could then drive up gas prices for power companies and other energy customers. “We would prefer to retain all of these assets, but as we anticipated when the transaction was announced, we must sell certain assets in the Rockies to obtain FTC approval,” Kinder Morgan Inc Chairman and CEO Richard D. Kinder said in a statement. Under the agreement with the FTC, Kinder Morgan said it would sell Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, Trailblazer Pipeline Co, its Casper-Douglas natural gas processing and West Frenchie Draw treating facilities in Wyoming, and its 50 percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. “I don’t see these assets as particularly surprising,” said Morningstar analyst Jason Stevens. The Rockies Express Pipeline, which connects gas fields in the Rocky Mountains to markets in the East, has seen its credit rating cut on worries that customers may be reluctant to commit to shipments in the coming years because of weak gas prices and competition from huge new supplies coming from the Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania. El Paso shareholders voted to approve the sale of the company last week, despite criticism from some investors that the company’s CEO, Doug Foshee, and the company’s adviser, Goldman Sachs (GS.N), had conflicts of interest that kept El Paso from getting the highest possible price.

63,KMI,UPDATE 2-Kinder Morgan to sell some assets for El Paso buy,"* Sales needed to win regulator approval for deal * Sees closing El Paso buy in May * Shares in Kinder Morgan, MLP both slip March 15 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc said on Thursday it had reached a verbal agreement with U.S. regulators to sell some of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP’s  pipeline assets in order to win approval for its planned purchase of El Paso Corp. The $21 billion deal, which will close in May, had been expected to attract scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission because of the merged company’s overlapping pipeline networks. Without the divestments, the combined company would have controlled 80,000 miles of pipe stretching from coast to coast, potentially allowing it to raise transport fees from oil and gas producers, which could then drive up gas prices for power companies and other energy customers. “We would prefer to retain all of these assets, but as we anticipated when the transaction was announced, we must sell certain assets in the Rockies to obtain FTC approval,” Kinder Morgan Inc Chairman and CEO Richard D. Kinder said in a statement. Under the agreement with the FTC, Kinder Morgan said it would sell Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, Trailblazer Pipeline Co, its Casper-Douglas natural gas processing and West Frenchie Draw treating facilities in Wyoming, and its 50 percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. “I don’t see these assets as particularly surprising,” said Morningstar analyst Jason Stevens. The Rockies Express Pipeline, which connects gas fields in the Rocky Mountains to markets in the East, has seen its credit rating cut on worries that customers may be reluctant to commit to shipments in the coming years because of weak gas prices and competition from huge new supplies coming from the Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania. El Paso shareholders voted to approve the sale of the company last week, despite criticism from some investors that the company’s CEO, Doug Foshee, and the company’s adviser, Goldman Sachs, had conflicts of interest that kept El Paso from getting the highest possible price.

65,KMI,Goldman reviews conflict-of-interest policies,"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is reviewing conflict-of-interest policies and procedures for investment bankers in light of a recent controversy over a Goldman-advised deal. The review comes after Goldman was criticized for advising El Paso Corp on its planned sale to Kinder Morgan Inc even though Goldman had a multibillion-dollar stake in the acquirer and its top energy banker held a $340,000 personal stake in Kinder Morgan. “We regret the El Paso Board wasn’t aware of the investment and are reviewing our policies and procedures related to bankers’ investments and how they are disclosed with the goal of strengthening them,” Goldman said in a statement on Friday. The review was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which said Goldman investment bankers may be required to disclose personal financial holdings to clients. The Wall Street divisions of other banks, including Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, are also reviewing how they manage conflicts on investment banking deals, the Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Representatives for Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A spokesperson for Barclays could not immediately be reached for comment. Goldman’s multiple positions in the El Paso-Kinder Morgan deal garnered particular attention after a prominent Delaware judge criticized the bank’s handling of the conflicts. “At this stage, I cannot readily accept the notion that Goldman would not seek to maximize the value of its multibillion-dollar investment in Kinder Morgan at the expense of El Paso, but, at the same time, be so keen on obtaining an investment banking fee in the tens of millions,” Judge Leo Strine wrote. He said he would “reluctantly” allow the deal to move forward. Goldman was not blind to such criticism: While the two companies were still in talks, Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein told El Paso CEO Douglas Foshee that Goldman was “very sensitive to the appearance of conflict,” according to court documents. Wall Street’s banking, trading and wealth-management businesses are rife with conflicts, and large investment banks already have policies in place to handle them, such as “Chinese walls” that research analysts must get special permission to cross if they need to communicate with bankers or traders. But banks still routinely get into sticky situations. In recent years, Goldman has become enmeshed in conflict-of-interest scandals related to subprime mortgage investments, an investment in Facebook, and its one-time practice of passing analyst tips to important clients before others. The disclosure to clients of investment bankers’ personal financial holdings is not a common practice. While it would be a step toward greater transparency, it is not one that bankers are likely to embrace. The Goldman banker with a personal stake in Kinder Morgan was Stephen Daniel. On Friday morning, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman characterized conflicts as inevitable and even routine. Morgan Stanley’s research analysts and financial advisers talk to clients every day about whether to buy stocks and bonds of companies that its bankers advise, and it is not unusual for a large investment bank to hold a stake in a company it advises on deals, Gorman said at an event hosted by Fortune magazine. Morgan Stanley handles conflicts by being transparent with clients about its interests, he said. “The more obvious the conflict, the higher the standard of care,” said Gorman.

68,KMI,S. Korea in talks for cut in El Paso assets-source,"NEW YORK/SEOUL, March 19 (Reuters) - South Korea state oil company Korea National Oil Corp is in talks to join a private equity-led consortium that agreed to buy El Paso Corp’s  oil and gas assets for $7.15 billion, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Monday. KNOC is negotiating to participate alongside Apollo Global Management LLC, Riverstone Holdings LLC and billionaire Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries as a minority investor in the exploration and production assets, the source said on condition of anonymity. Spokespeople for KNOC, El Paso, Apollo, Riverstone and Access Industries declined to comment. Kinder Morgan Inc is selling off the business, which it would have picked up as part of its $21 billion deal to buy rival El Paso late last year. Because Kinder Morgan was only interested in El Paso’s pipeline assets, it promptly put the E&P; business up for sale, hoping to use the proceeds to reduce the cost of the original deal.

The move complements a previously announced $60 million expansion project at Carteret, which added more than 1 million barrels of storage to the nearly 8 million barrels already in place at that site, the company said in a news release. The company said its Linden terminal handled as much as 36,000 barrels per day of ethanol with 550,000 barrels of storage through Citgo Petroleum Corp’s Tremley Point terminal. The pipeline links the company’s unit train receiving terminal in Linden to storage tanks in Carteret and gives customers more flexibility in accessing ethanol for gasoline blending. Kinder Morgan initially projects that an additional 195,000 barrels of storage will go to ethanol service for domestic specifications, but the system will be optimized for export grades in the future as market conditions allow.",4032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/kinder-morgan-ethanol-pipeline/kinder-morgan-completes-new-jersey-ethanol-pipeline-idUSL2E8F36VZ20120403

The company said the project would enable Kinder Morgan to move the condensate from Kankakee County, Illinois, to existing terminals near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, beginning on July 1, 2014, given adequate shipper support. The open season will end on May 31 and Kinder Morgan is seeking binding commitments for minimum contacts of 10 years and 5,000 barrels per day. The project involves modifying the western leg of the 1,900-mile, (3,057 km) multi-product Cochin Pipeline to connect to the Explorer Pipeline Co in Kankakee County and reverse the product flow to move condensate northwest to Alberta. The project would provide about 75,000 barrels per day of light condensate capacity on Cochin and provide a new source of supply for diluent. “Our proposal will provide the rapidly growing Canadian market with very cost-effective access to light condensate from both the Eagle Ford Shale and the U.S. Gulf Coast,” said Don Lindley, vice president of business development for KMP’s Products Pipeline group. “This open season was prompted by significant, tangible interest expressed in the proposed reversal.”",4232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/kindermorgan-cochin/update-1-kinder-morgan-seeks-interest-on-light-condensate-idUSL2E8FNGHU20120423

86,KMI,TEXT-Fitch Maintains El Paso on Rating Watch Negative,"NEW YORK, May 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has maintained its Rating Watch Negative on El Paso Corp. (EP) ahead of the final close of its acquisition by Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) as follows: El Paso Corporation —$1.25 billion senior secured revolving credit facility (2016) ‘BBB-‘; —Senior unsecured notes and debentures ‘BB+’. El Paso Energy Capital Trust I —Trust convertible preferred securities ‘BB-‘. Concurrently, Fitch has taken various rating actions on El Paso’s subsidiaries and related entities as follows: Fitch has placed the following ratings on Rating Watch Positive: El Paso Natural Gas Company (EPNG) —IDR ‘BBB-‘; —Senior unsecured debt ‘BBB-‘. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (TGP) —IDR ‘BBB-‘; —Senior unsecured debt ‘BBB-‘. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: El Paso Pipeline Partners Operating Company (EPBO) —IDR at ‘BBB-‘; —Senior unsecured debt at ‘BBB-‘. Fitch has upgraded the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG) —IDR to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB-‘; —Senior unsecured debt to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB-‘. Southern Natural Gas Company (SNG) —IDR to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB-‘; —Senior unsecured debt to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB-‘. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with an Evolving Outlook and withdrawn the ratings: El Paso Exploration & Production Company (EPEP) (now named EP Energy) —IDR at ‘BB+’; —Senior secured revolving credit facility (2012) at ‘BBB-‘; —Senior unsecured debt at ‘BB+’. Roughly $13 billion in debt is affected by today’s ratings actions. The Rating Watch Negative on El Paso Corp. reflects the uncertainty surrounding EP’s final capital structure, as well as EP’s linkage with its new owner KMI. KMI is the parent company to Fitch rated entity Kinder Morgan Kansas, Inc. (KMK; Issuer Default Rating ‘BB+’ on Rating Watch Negative). The acquisition of EP and the sale of its E&P; business and the planned drop down of its remaining fully owned pipeline operating subsidiaries (TGP, EPNG, Cheyenne Plains) to KMP and EPB will leave EP as an intermediate holding company of Kinder Morgan Inc. Under the terms of the new KMI acquisition credit facilities, EP will at KMI/EP acquisition close become a restricted subsidiary and guarantor of KMI indebtedness. At acquisition close Fitch expects KMI to repay the borrowings under and retire EP’s secured revolver using the proceeds from asset sales. Fitch expects that EP’s ratings will ultimately be linked to the ratings of KMI following the proposed drop down transactions and asset divestures. Given the acquisition by KMI, and uncertainty surrounding future dropdowns and the final EP capital structure, the Rating Watch Negative remains appropriate. The Rating Watch Positive on TGP and EPNG is due to the expected future retirement of the EP credit facility and the planned drop down of 100% of TGP and 50% of EPNG into KMP (‘BBB’; Stable Outlook). The drop down of these assets is expected to occur contemporaneously with KMP’s FTC driven asset divesture slated for the third quarter of 2012. The credit linkage (one notch separation) that TGP and EPNG currently share with their parent company EP will be significantly diminished with the retirement of EP’s secured revolver combined with the drop down of TGP and EPNG into KMP, as TGP and EPNG will be released as collateral. Fitch expects that at the close of the drop down into KMP, TGP’s and EPNG’s credit profiles will likely warrant higher ratings or affirmations at current levels. TGP and EPNG are both relatively low risk FERC regulated interstate natural gas pipelines. Both pipelines have moderate leverage, solid debt service coverage metrics and operate with a majority of capacity contracted for under long term reservation contracts which are largely volume and commodity price insensitive. It is likely that following the dropdown to KMP, TGP’s and EPNG’s ratings will be more closely linked to their new direct owner, KMP and be more reflective of their stand-alone credit profiles. The affirmation of EPBO reflects Fitch’s belief that over the near term EPBO will be unaffected by KMI’s acquisition of EP. The drop downs of the remaining 14% interest in CIG and 100% Cheyenne Plains is being done at a reasonable 8x-to-9x 2012 EBITDA multiple and further increases EPBO’s portfolio of low risk FERC regulated pipeline assets. The ratings and Stable Outlook on EPBO reflect EPBO’s consistent earnings and cash flows from its generally low business risk pipeline assets. Fitch believes that EPBO will continue to possess investment grade credit metrics and business risk profile following the merger close. Fitch expects any future dropdowns to EPBO be financed with a balance of debt and equity consistent with past practices and investment grade credit metrics. Fitch’s upgrades of CIG and SNG are reflective of the low risk nature of these FERC regulated pipelines coupled with solid credit and financial operating metrics. The recommendation also considers that both CIG and SNG are now or will be fully owned by EPBO (‘BBB-‘; Stable Outlook). Prior to the full acquisition of 100% of SNG (last year) and the now 100% acquisition of CIG, Fitch had constrained the ratings to a one notch separation from EP despite stand-alone operating and financial characteristics that might indicate a higher rating. This was due to the legal, financial and operating ties that CIG and SNG had with EP, EPB’s general partner and previously a partial direct owner in the pipelines. The upgrades reflect CIG and SNG’s subsidiary relationship to their now 100% owner parent company EPBO. As subsidiaries of EPBO, EPBO has substantial control over the pipelines operations and finances, including distributions, which are needed to support debt at EPBO and distributions to EPBO’s unit holders. Given this linkage the Fitch rates CIG and SNG one notch higher than EPBO to reflect the structural superiority the CIG and SNG have as operating asset issuers to EPBO. EPEP’s ratings are being affirmed and withdrawn for business reasons. Catalysts for Future Rating Actions: Catalysts for rating actions at EP include any future rating action taken at KMI, as well as, an inability to reduce consolidated KMI/EP debt with asset dropdown proceeds on a timely basis. Catalysts for positive rating actions at TGP and EPNG will be driven by execution of their dropdown into higher rated parent KMP and their eventual release as collateral from EP and KMI obligations. Catalysts for a negative rating action at EPBO include increased leverage, an acquisition or transaction that significantly increases leverage or operating risk and a significant increase in partnership distributions that results in a deterioration in distribution coverage, which Fitch expects to be over 1.0x. Catalysts for negative ratings actions at CIG and SNG would include an aggressive growth strategy that results in increased leverage.",5222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-ratings-el-paso/text-fitch-maintains-el-paso-on-rating-watch-negative-idUSWNA789520120522

88,KMI,UPDATE 1-Kinder pares size of Trans Mountain expansion,"* Wins 20-year commitments for 510,000 bpd * Pipeline capacity would climb to 750,000 bpd * Faces criticism from Vancouver city council By Jeffrey Jones CALGARY, Alberta, May 23 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners has reduced the size of a planned expansion of its pipeline to the Pacific Coast after fewer shippers than expected signed 20-year contracts that would allow surging Canadian oil supplies to be shipped to Asia, the company said on Wednesday. Kinder Morgan now plans a $4.1 billion expansion of its Trans Mountain pipeline to the Vancouver area from Alberta, increasing capacity to 750,000 barrels a day from 300,000. That is down from last month’s estimate of 850,000. It had expected enough contracts to support a $5 billion project with crude production from the Alberta oil sands forecast to more than double over the next decade. But a few potential shippers it thought would sign onto the lengthy obligations had failed to obtain their boards’ approvals by the deadline, prompting the reduction, Kinder Morgan said. The Trans Mountain expansion is the second multibillion-dollar proposal aimed at opening up lucrative new markets in Asia for Canadian oil producers, now captive to U.S. customers amid a glut that has led to bargain-basement price discounts. The first, Enbridge Inc’s $5.5 billion Northern Gateway pipeline to Kitimat, British Columbia, from Alberta, is the subject of public hearings that began in January. Both projects face opposition from environmental groups and some native communities in British Columbia. Vancouver city council has also come out against the Kinder expansion, which would increase tanker traffic in the city’s harbor. Ottawa has signaled strong support for new pipelines to the West Coast, and is making changes to regulatory reviews aimed at speeding up approvals. Kinder Morgan said one benefit of its proposal is that it would be able to add a second pipeline along the existing one for much of the 1,150 km (715 mile) route. “We’re basing our project on the commitments we’ve received. The market will determine what projects are being supported, and we’re confident that we’ve got a good approach and we’re going to focus on making sure that we can bring this to fruition,” Kinder Morgan spokesman Andrew Galarnyk said. Under current plans, the company would file regulatory applications by the end of 2013 for a target in-service date of 2017. Despite staunch opposition to the project from Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, Kinder Morgan remains in talks with city officials in hopes of winning favor, Galarnyk said. “We’re obviously working through some of the concerns and we’ll be engaging with all of the interested stakeholders. We’re developing our consultation and engagement program, and that’s set to roll out later this summer,” he said. City officials were not immediately available for comment. The current Trans Mountain system is routinely overbooked as shippers seek to get oil supplies to British Columbia and Washington state refineries, as well as to tankers. On Wednesday, Kinder Morgan said shippers would be able to move just 32 percent of their hoped-for volumes in June as companies clamored for space.

89,KMI,Kinder finalizes size of Trans Mountain expansion,"* Wins 20-year commitments for 510,000 bpd * Pipeline capacity would climb to 750,000 bpd * Faces criticism from Vancouver city council CALGARY, Alberta, May 23 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners has finalized the size of a planned expansion of its Canadian oil pipeline to the Pacific Coast, a $4.1 billion project backed by shippers committing to two decades of transport to Asian markets. Kinder Morgan, proposing the second major project to open up  lucrative Pacific Rim markets to growing volumes of Canadian crude, said on Wednesday it plans to boost the capacity of the line to 750,000 barrels a day (bpd) from 300,000. The pipeline extends 1,150 km (715 miles) to Burnaby, British Columbia, from near Edmonton, Alberta. The company said one of the benefits of the proposal is that it would be able to add a second pipeline along the existing one for much of the route. The expansion, which has faced criticism from environmental groups and Vancouver’s city council, is 150,000 barrels a day smaller in capacity than had been proposed in April, when the company said it expected a $5 billion capital cost. It said a few of the shippers had failed to obtain their boards’ approvals by the deadline for making the binding, 20-year commitments. In the end, it received contracts for about 510,000 barrels a day. The proposal follows Enbridge Inc’s C$5.5 billion ($5.4 billion) Northern Gateway pipeline, now in the midst of public hearings. It too would carry oil sands-derived crude across the Rocky Mountains to a port at Kitimat, British Columbia, from Alberta. Under Kinder Morgan’s plan, the company would file its regulatory applications by the end of 2013 for a target in-service date of 2017.",5232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/transmountain-expansion/kinder-finalizes-size-of-trans-mountain-expansion-idUSL1E8GN62B20120523

92,KMI,UPDATE 1-Kinder Morgan secures commitments on Cochin line,"NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP said on Tuesday it completed a binding season to reverse its Cochin propane and ethane-propane pipeline to carry 95,000 barrels per day (bpd) of condensates from Illinois to terminals in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. The company said it secured commitments for at least 10 years on 100,000 barrels per day of capacity during the open season, which started in late April. The reversal will help transport light condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale and the U.S. Gulf Coast to Canadian market, according to Tom Bannigan, president of Kinder Morgan’s products pipeline group. With enough shipper support, the pipeline will begin service on July 1, 2014, company spokeswoman Emily Mir said. For a total cost of about $225 million, the project will link the Cochin line with the Explorer products pipeline, which carries refined petroleum products from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the Midwest, in Kankakee County, Illinois, and reverse Cochin to move condensate northwest to Alberta. After making changes during the open season, Kinder Morgan plans to transport 95,000 barrels per day of light condensate  on Cochin. The company had estimated the pipeline would have a 75,000 bpd capacity. Explorer, owned by subsidiaries of Chevron Corp, Phillips 66, Marathon Petroleum Corp, Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, Shell and American Capital Strategies Inc, already had an open season underway until May 7 for a link-up with Enbridge Inc’s Southern Lights line in Illinois.",6052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/kindermorgan-cochin/update-1-kinder-morgan-secures-commitments-on-cochin-line-idUSL1E8H552V20120605

95,KMI,UPDATE 1-Kinder Morgan launches 300 kbpd Eagle Ford-Houston pipeline,"HOUSTON, June 14 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan on Thursday started throughput on a 300,000 barrel per day (bpd) pipeline to ship rising oil and condensate production from the Eagle Ford, Texas region to the Houston refining hub. The massive $215 million pipeline - the latest brought online to take crude from the prolific Texas region to the refining center - will deliver supplies into terminalling facilities that feed plants along the Houston Ship Channel. In addition, it will eventually tie into a planned $200 million condensate processing facility which will be constructed near Kinder Morgan’s Galena Park terminal on the channel. The facility, which is expected to launch in the first quarter of 2014, will have an initial capacity of 50,000 bpd with the potential to reach 100,000 bpd. Output from the south Texas Eagle Ford region has swelled in recent years, contributing to the overall rise in U.S. oil production as high prices and new technologies drive companies into unconventional plays. Eagle Ford output hit 520,000 bpd in April, nearly double the 270,000 bpd produced in June of 2011, according to estimates from energy consultancy Bentek.",6142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/kindermorgan-pipeline-oil/update-1-kinder-morgan-launches-300-kbpd-eagle-ford-houston-pipeline-idUSL1E8HE8OM20120614

Nominations have exceeded capacity since late 2010. The company has proposed a $4.1 billion expansion of the system that would more than double capacity to 750,000 barrels a day. It would be in service around 2017.

121,KMI,Power problems delay post-Isaac return for hardest hit refinery,"* Kinder Morgan declares force majeure on Tennessee pipeline * EPA grants waiver to eight states on sale of winter gasoline HOUSTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - New power supply problems on Wednesday brought a temporary halt to Phillips 66’s  attempt to restart its 247,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Alliance, Louisiana, the hardest hit of six plants shut by Hurricane Isaac’s drive across Louisiana last week. Refineries have recovered more quickly than offshore platforms. Nearly 7 percent, or 1.17 million barrels per day of national crude oil refining capacity was shut due to Isaac which came ashore on Aug. 28 in Louisiana, bringing heavy rains and a high storm surge that busted levees in the region. However, to stave off fuel shortages in the southeastern United States, the federal Environmental Protection Agency granted a waiver on Wednesday allowing the sale of winter-blend gasoline in the U.S. states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina and North Carolina. . Summer-blend gasoline is designed to prevent smog formation in higher atmospheric temperatures. As of Wednesday, only the Alliance refinery was not restarting or back in production. Phillips said power was expected to be back by late Wednesday and the restart of the Alliance refinery would resume. Phillips had initially begun the restart on Tuesday after Isaac left floodwaters 2 feet (61 centimeters) deep in sections of the refinery.. More than a week after the slow-moving low-level hurricane  hit the Gulf Coast, five refineries with total 923,000 bpd of capacity were restarting and four refineries with total 980,000 bpd capacity were running at reduced rates. The U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said on Wednesday that 49.33 percent, or 680,749 barrels, in daily oil production remained shut in the U.S-regulated northern Gulf of Mexico. Also 25.71 percent, or 1.157 billion cubic feet (bcf) per day in natural gas output was still shuttered due to the storm. So far, a total 11.2 million barrels of oil production and 24.8 bcf in natural gas output has been lost due to the storm. Damage from Isaac led to Kinder Morgan Inc declaring force majeure on the Bay Marchand 5 Central Gathering System on the 7.5 bcf capacity Tennessee Gas Pipeline.

126,KMI,Kinder Morgan may convert California natgas line to crude-CEO,"HOUSTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  may convert part of a natural gas pipeline system to transport West Texas crude oil to Southern California, a move analysts lauded on Thursday. Allowing Los Angeles-area refiners to replace pricey Alaskan crude with cheaper oil from the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico “would be a huge game-changer,” Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analyst Robert Kessler said Thursday in a note to investors. Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Richard Kinder told analysts on Wednesday that the company is considering a possible $2 billion project to convert part of its underused El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) pipeline system to possibly transport up to 400,000 barrels per day of light Permian crude to Southern California. “That is very speculative at this point, but there are a lot of opportunities that could be very exciting there,” Kinder said. “We have had some interesting conversations with potential shippers on that line who are very enthusiastic.” Some Southern California refiners have said they are looking into transporting light-sweet crude by rail or pipeline to their plants to capitalize on cheap inland U.S. crude already processed by refiners in other regions to varying degrees. Tesoro Corp last month began receiving North Dakota Bakken crude oil via rail at its 120,000 bpd refinery in Anacortes, Washington. In August when the company announced its $2.5 billion purchase of BP Plc’s 240,000 bpd Los Angeles-area refinery next to Tesoro’s 103,800 bpd plant, Tesoro CEO Greg Goff told analysts that he expected to see more U.S. crude move west, “whether from North Dakota or West Texas.” Also, Alon Energy USA Inc President Paul Eisman in August told analysts that the company was in advanced talks to move cheaper inland U.S. crude to its 84,500 bpd Southern California refining system via new rail facilities or existing pipelines. He declined to provide details, but said Alon would “more likely than not” start with Bakken crude as well. Credit Suisse analyst Ed Westlake said in a note to investors on Thursday that key drivers of oversupply of crude in the Gulf Coast region — home to 44 percent of the nation’s refining capacity — is supply coming from the Permian as well as the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas. Much of the Gulf Coast’s refining capacity is designed to process heavy-sour crudes like that from Venezuela or Canada rather than the light-sweet variety that comes from the Permian and Eagle Ford. Such refineries can still process that light crude, but it makes less efficient use of heavy-oriented refineries because some units not needed to process light crude, like cokers, would not be needed. “If there is no available light processing capacity in the Gulf, we believe it would make sense to push crude to the California market,” Westlake said. Kinder stressed that Kinder Morgan’s consideration of converting part of the EPNG system to transport crude is in “very early stages of our thoughts.” He said Kinder Morgan would not convert the entire system and would still deliver gas to customers at whatever throughput levels they want. “We have multiple lines across there, and still could convert a line all the way from the Permian into Southern California,” Kinder said. The 10,200-mile (16,415 km) EPNG system now transports natural gas from the San Juan, Permian and Anadarko basins to California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and northern Mexico. The EPNG system connects with the company’s 500-mile (800.7 km) Mojave Pipeline near Cadiz, California, about 215 miles (346 km) west of Los Angeles. Kinder Morgan spokesman Larry Pierce said on Thursday that it was too premature to specify which lines would be involved in a crude conversion because it was “extremely early in the process.” ",10182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/kindermorgan-pipeline-conversion/kinder-morgan-may-convert-california-natgas-line-to-crude-ceo-idUSL1E8LI9KE20121018

The natural gas pipeline, which runs over 678 miles from Wyoming to Oregon, has already been completed. The pipeline is owned and operated by Kinder Morgan Inc. Even though the pipeline is in service, it is still possible to mitigate its impact on the fish and critical habitats, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled.

However, the service concluded that the pipeline would not jeopardize the species, and the Bureau of Land Management authorized the project. A coalition of environmental groups challenged that decision. In its ruling, the 9th Circuit found that the authorization was arbitrary and capricious, partly because it did not take into account the potential impact of withdrawing 337.8 million gallons of groundwater from 64 wells along the pipeline.

134,KMI,"Factbox: NY Harbor oil terminals, refineries crippled by Sandy","(Reuters) - The New York harbor remained crippled from Hurricane Sandy on Sunday, with some signs of progress in restoring normal flows through the biggest and most important oil-trading hub in the country. Kinder Morgan said on Sunday some marine operations had been restored at its refined petroleum terminals in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and Staten Island, New York. Colonial Pipeline, the 800,000 barrel per day conduit that supplies 15 percent of East Coast fuel demand, said its system had “returned to maximum rates” by Friday, but infrastructure issues including damaged facilities, closed roads and gas station power failures continued to hinder operations in New Jersey. As fuel shortages and long queues continued to plague the New York City and Long Island areas, the city on Friday began to ration gasoline for the first time since the 1970s, following a similar move by New Jersey. Hess Corp said on Thursday it had completed post-Sandy assessments at its 70,000 barrel per day (bpd) Port Reading, New Jersey, refinery, but was unable to set a time frame for restarting the plant due to repairs needed by the local power authority. The 238,000 barrel-per-day plant owned by Phillips 66 in Bayway, New Jersey, will likely be shut for another two to three weeks as repairs are carried out, primarily on electrical equipment damaged by saltwater. Some 28 percent of gas stations in the New York metropolitan area did not have gasoline available for sale on Friday, the same as the day before, according to the Department of Energy’s data arm. Kinder Morgan said all of its facilities were moving product inbound and outbound with limited marine operations restored at its Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and Staten Island, New York, terminals. COLONIAL PIPELINE said that although its system returned to “maximum rates,” the situation in New Jersey had “not returned to normal” due to infrastructure problems that could lead to additional slowdowns or shutdowns. It said problems included damage to customer facilities, road closures and power supply problems. HESS CORP said it still does not have a time frame for restarting its 70,000 bpd refinery in Port Reading after completing an assessment of refinery equipment, which is now on standby. “The local power authority ... advised that repairs will be needed to a local substation before sufficient power is available to support the refinery’s start-up process,” it said. “A timeframe for the refinery’s restart will be determined once the full power requirement can be met.” A brief power outage on Thursday forced it to stop marine and rack loading at Port Reading. The company said marine and rack operations at its Bayonne, New Jersey, terminal were still suspended on Thursday. Marine operations at its Newark, New Jersey, terminal also remained suspended. All other Hess terminals continued to operate. New York City Mayor MICHAEL BLOOMBERG on Thursday ordered the rationing of gasoline sold in the city. BLOOMBERG also waived the requirement that buildings and homes in New York City utilize heating oil with sulfur content of less than 0.15 parts per million, effective through December 7. MOTIVA ENTERPRISES restarted rack operations from its terminal in Sewaren, New Jersey. BUCKEYE PIPELINE said a terminal had a temporary power outage at Inwood, but continued operations on standby generators. Power has since been restored, the company said. A NOR’EASTER blew into areas affected by Hurricane Sandy and dropped record snow in New York and New Jersey, complicating the energy network’s recovery. COMMERCIAL STOCKPILES of gasoline in the U.S. central Atlantic, which covers four states, including New York and New Jersey, slipped by only 310,000 barrels last week, government data showed. MERCINI LADY, a 47,000-tonne clean oil tanker, was heading out of New York harbor after discharging off the southwestern shore of Manhattan, shipping data showed. BP had chartered the Liberian-flagged tanker to carry fuel from Texas to Montreal, but it was later diverted to the New York harbor after the U.S. government authorized waivers to the Jones Act, allowing non-U.S. vessels to transit between U.S. ports. KINDER MORGAN, which had resumed limited operations at its Carteret and Perth Amboy terminals in New Jersey on Monday, said about 238 barrels (some 10,000 gallons) of biodiesel leaked from its Carteret terminal into nearby Rum Creek and reached the Arthur Kill waterway. It said the spill was contained within a day of the storm. It has resumed limited marine operations at Carteret and hopes to do so soon for Perth Amboy and Staten Island. NUSTAR ENERGY LP said it had re-established “limited” pipeline and barge deliveries at its Linden, New Jersey, marine and storage terminal. It previously said the 4.1-million-barrel terminal was severely damaged by Sandy. IMTT BAYONNE oil tank farm and terminal, which accounts for about a fifth of the harbor’s capacity, was only half back to normal by Monday, although damage assessments found that the majority of the facility’s piers were ready for use and there had been no oil leaks, according to co-owner Macquarie Infrastructure Co. It gave no time frame for restoring full operations, but said IMTT would work through the week - including with relevant authorities - to return to full operations. PHILLIPS 66 said it expects to resume “normal operations” at its 238,000 bpd Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, in two to three weeks. The plant has been shut since October 29, and sources said it appeared to sustain serious damage to the electrical equipment after being flooded by Sandy’s 14-foot storm surge. Phillips also confirmed it spilled some 7,700 gallons of fuel. Its terminal at Tremley Point, New Jersey, is expected to be operating at a limited capacity by the end of November. Phillips 66 also said it restored the refinery’s capability to pump existing refined product inventory to the terminal, repaired the refinery’s marine dock to receive barge shipments of fuel and made arrangements with third parties to supply fuel to the refinery and terminal through pipelines and marine transport. BUCKEYE PIPELINE said its Linden line was able to receive fuel from all existing locations and that Colonial Pipeline, Harbor Pipeline and Kinder Morgan’s Carteret terminal had all resumed operating into Linden. COAST GUARD removed restrictions along the Arthur Kill waterway, which separates Staten Island from New Jersey, as long as vessels move slowly along its waters, a Coast Guard agent said.

137,KMI,El Paso's $110 mln settlement over Kinder Morgan deal approved,"* Approval ends case that changed view of deal conflicts * Judge calls settlement “substantial achievement” Dec 3 (Reuters) - Pipeline operator El Paso received court approval on Monday for a $110 million class-action settlement with shareholders who alleged the $23 billion sale of the company to Kinder Morgan Inc was riddled with conflicts of interest. The case may have a lasting impact on Wall Street dealmaking by making advisers and bankers more sensitive to disclosing conflicts of interest when arranging mergers and takeovers. The settlement ended shareholder lawsuits that accused El Paso’s chief executive, Douglass Foshee, and deal adviser, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, of having an interest in holding down the purchase price. Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Leo Strine called the settlement a “substantial achievement” for shareholders. In February, Strine “reluctantly” allowed a vote by El Paso shareholders on the deal, which was approved with 95 percent of El Paso shares voted in favor. The deal created the largest natural gas pipeline operator in the United States. Strine at the time called the behavior in deal negotiations “disturbing,” and he piled scorn on Goldman Sachs for its eagerness to remain El Paso’s adviser despite holding a 19 percent stake in Kinder Morgan. As part of the settlement, Goldman Sachs gave up its $20 million advisory fee. Strine’s February opinion also put the spotlight on Foshee’s interest in leading a buyout of El Paso assets that were unwanted by Kinder Morgan, something Foshee never disclosed to his board. Shareholders linked that interest to Foshee’s negotiating tactics, which included agreeing to cut an initial deal price of $27.55 a share to the $26.87 price the companies went public with in October 2011. While Strine allowed the deal to move ahead, his February opinion drew a line for dealmakers, and deal lawyers have been more concerned with disclosing conflicts to avoid legal liability. “This was a very interesting case,” Strine said on Monday. “It started productive discussions in certain circles.” The settlement is among the five largest in the Court of Chancery, a popular venue for shareholder lawsuits, according to Stuart Grant, who represented shareholders in the case. Four individual investors objected to the settlement for varying reasons, including a claim it was inadequate. Strine overruled those objections.

138,KMI,UPDATE 2-Kinder Morgan boosts size of Canadian pipeline project,"* Capacity raised to 890,000 bpd from 750,000 * Price tag climbs to $5.4 billion from $4.1 billion * Project will increase Vancouver tanker traffic By Jeffrey Jones CALGARY, Alberta, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners has boosted the size of a proposed expansion of its Canadian oil pipeline by almost a third to $5.4 billion after signing up more customers for the project aimed at carrying growing volumes of oil sands-derived crude to the Pacific Coast, it said on Thursday. Kinder Morgan said it now hopes to expand its Trans Mountain Pipeline between Edmonton, Alberta, and Vancouver to 890,000 barrels per day, up from the previously proposed 750,000. It currently ships 300,000 bpd. The move comes as Canadian oil producers clamor to reach new markets for their supply, which is getting slapped with deep price discounts because of limited pipeline capacity to glutted traditional markets such as the U.S. Midwest. The issue, which the Alberta and Canadian governments have warned is starting to take a toll on the domestic economy, was brought into sharp focus again on Thursday when Enbridge Inc , the main mover of Canadian oil to the United States, was forced to limit shipments due to operational issues. That pressured prices further. With its expansion project, Kinder Morgan wants to add an adjacent pipeline along the length of its current one, with much of the new capacity aimed at reaching Asian refineries via tanker. It would also increase the number of loading berths at its Vancouver marine terminal to accommodate as many as 34 tankers per month, up from five currently. The project would be in service in 2017. Kinder Morgan said 13 companies had signed long-term shipping contracts that will account for 700,000 bpd of the total capacity. The company plans to file its application to build the project in late 2013. Last year, it first proposed an expansion to 850,000 bpd, then cut it to 750,000 in May after some of its supporters dropped out, Kinder Morgan Canada President Ian Anderson said. It has increased it again following a supplemental call for contracts to ship on the pipeline, Anderson said. He said the short-term market impacts, which have recently pushed Canadian heavy crude prices to more than $40 a barrel under U.S. benchmark oil, were not likely behind the resurgence of interest. “I think it’s a broader recognition that pipeline capacity out of the (Western Canadian producing) basin is growing in its constraints and that more market access is required. This is a piece of that puzzle,” Anderson told reporters. “As you know, we’re going to take the next three to five years before we have all the permits and our construction completed.” The project is the second aimed at opening up Pacific Rim markets for Canadian crude. Enbridge’s C$6 billion ($6.1 billion) Northern Gateway project is currently the subject of public hearings. A regulatory decision is expected by the end of this year. Both face stiff opposition from environmental groups and many native communities who warn of increased greenhouse gas emissions as oil sands development intensifies and of higher risks of oil spills. Kinder Morgan has also faced opposition from the Vancouver city council over the increased tanker traffic the expanded capacity would bring. Anderson, whose company has spent the last few months holding information sessions in communities that will be affected, said the projects differ mainly due to the fact that Trans Mountain expansion will include adding new facilities to existing ones rather than starting from scratch. “Obviously, some of the issues that Enbridge faces from environmental concerns are no different than ones that we’ll face,” he said. “I think there is a lot of work still to be done to get out the facts and the studies around some of those issues and we’ll continue to do that.” The companies that signed up for long-term capacity are BP Plc, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, Canadian Oil Sands Ltd, Cenovus Energy Inc, Devon Energy Corp, Husky Energy Inc, Imperial Oil Ltd , Nexen Inc, Statoil ASA, Tesoro Corp , Total SA and two subsidiaries of Suncor Energy Inc.",1102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/kindermorgan-transmountain/update-2-kinder-morgan-boosts-size-of-canadian-pipeline-project-idUSL1E9CAD2P20130110

140,KMI,UPDATE 1-Kinder Morgan to add tanks and dock at Houston Channel,"Jan 14 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners on Monday said it will invest $170 million to build a new shipping dock and add refined fuel storage tanks in the Houston Ship Channel, in step with increasing U.S. fuel exports. The company made the announcement just days after the expanded 400,000 barrels-per-day Seaway pipeline began pumping crude oil to Houston, Texas, giving nearby refiners better access to cheap U.S. crude and adding to their incentive to export refined products. Kinder Morgan said it has a letter-of-intent agreement with a major refiner on the Houston Channel to build six tanks with 150,000-barrel capacity and four more with 75,000-barrel capacity. The tanks will be connected to Kinder Morgan’s Galena Park terminal and the refinery and store gasoline and other refined products, according to Joe Hollier, a spokesman with Kinder Morgan. Hollier declined to identify the refiner. The new dock can handle ocean-going vessels and will serve up to eight of the refinery’s vessels and four Kinder Morgan vessels every month. “This project will alleviate existing dock congestion among Kinder Morgan’s Houston Ship Channel terminals (and) provide additional export capacity value,” Jeff Armstrong, president of Kinder Morgan, said in a statement. Kinder Morgan recently started a crude oil and condensates pipeline that can transport 50,000 bpd of condensate from the Eagle Ford shale play in south Texas to the Houston Ship Channel.",1142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/kindermorgan-houstonchannel/update-1-kinder-morgan-to-add-tanks-and-dock-at-houston-channel-idUSL2N0AJ6ID20130114
141,KMI,UPDATE 1-Kinder Morgan Partners raises payout 11 percent,"Jan 16 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which operates oil and gas pipelines and terminals, said on Wednesday it raised its cash distribution 11 percent in the fourth quarter, helped by higher volumes in most of its businesses. Kinder Morgan, the largest so-called midstream company in North America, was created when it finalized its purchase of El Paso Corp last year in a deal valued around $38 billion. The company has benefited from the boom in oil and gas exploration surrounding shale formations in North America because many of those basins had little or no infrastructure. The Houston company raised its quarterly cash distribution to $1.29 per unit, up from $1.16 a year earlier. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is a master limited partnership (MLP), a tax efficient structure that distributes most of its cash flows to investors. Kinder Morgan Inc  owns the general partnership interest in Kinder Morgan Partners. “We currently have identified approximately $11 billion in expansion and joint venture investments at KMP that we have, or are confident that we will soon have, under contract and we are pursuing customer commitments for many more projects,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Kinder said in a statement. This year alone, Kinder Morgan Partners said it expects to invest nearly $3 billion in expansion and acquisitions, it said.

147,KMI,Kinder Morgan to buy pipeline firm Copano for $3.22 billion,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP KMP.N will buy natural gas pipeline operator Copano Energy LLC CPNO.O for $3.22 billion to tap into growing demand for infrastructure to transport vast supplies from the shale fields of Texas and Oklahoma. Private equity firm TPG Capital TPG.UL, Copano’s top shareholder with a stake of more than 14 percent, will get a 41 percent premium to its $300 million investment made in 2010, if the deal goes through. The deal is the latest in a flurry of multi-billion-dollar takeovers in the U.S. pipeline industry over the past two years as companies rush to cash in on a shortage of pipelines to move gas and gas liquids such as ethane and propane. The oversupply of gas and gas liquids, largely due to the advent of new drilling methods such as hydraulic fracturing, has also hurt prices. Many companies have announced plans to build new pipelines, but stricter regulations and environmental concerns have delayed the completion of several projects. “Copano is already executing on a substantial backlog of expansion projects for which it has secured customer commitments and is exploring a significant amount of projects incremental to these,” said Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Richard Kinder. Kinder is also the chief executive and co-founder of Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), which sold its Tennessee Gas Pipeline and a 50 percent stake in El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to Kinder Morgan Energy for about $6.22 billion in August. Kinder Morgan in May won U.S. approval for its $23 billion acquisition of rival El Paso Corp. Kinder Morgan Energy said late on Tuesday it would offer 0.4563 of its unit for each share of Copano. The ratio translates into a price of $40.91 per share - a 23.5 percent premium to Copano’s Tuesday close of $33.13. Including debt, the total deal value is about $5 billion, Kinder Morgan Energy said. Thomson Reuters StarMine’s intrinsic valuation model suggests Copano should be trading at $22.44. The models take into account analyst estimates for growth, usually over five years, and then model the typical growth trajectory of companies over a longer period of time. “While not inexpensive, we think the transaction will enhance KMP’s competitive position by enhancing its ability to provide a broader package of midstream services to producers and provides additional sources of future growth,” Simmons & Co analyst Bill Herbert said. Shares of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Energy fell 1 percent to $88.58 on Wednesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Copano rose 16 percent to $38.56 on the Nasdaq. Copano owns an interest in or operates about 6,900 miles of pipelines with capacity of 2.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of gas and nine processing plants with more than 1 bcf/d capacity. Kinder Morgan Energy owns an interest in or runs about 46,000 miles of pipelines that transport gas, gasoline, crude oil and other products, while its 180 terminals store petroleum products, chemicals and such other products. “As a result of this acquisition, we will be able to pursue incremental development in the Eagle Ford Shale play in south Texas, gain entry into the Barnett Shale Combo in north Texas and the Mississippi Lime and Woodford Shales in Oklahoma,” CEO Kinder said. The transaction poses minimal execution risk given that Kinder Morgan Energy already has a joint venture with Copano in the Eagle Ford region, said analyst Herbert. The acquisition will add at least 10 cents per unit to Kinder Morgan Energy’s earnings for at least the next five years beginning 2014, the company said. Kinder Morgan Energy said TPG, to which Copano had sold 10.33 million convertible preferred units at $29.05 each, has agreed to support the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter. Kinder Morgan Energy expects to retain the “vast majority” of 415 people employed by Copano, which was founded in 1992 by John Eckel Jr, who served as its chief executive until his death in November 2009. Citi advised Kinder Morgan Energy, while Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP and Bracewell & Giuliani acted as legal counsel. Barclays Capital Inc and Jefferies & Co Inc were the financial advisers to Copano, with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acting as its legal counsel. Robert W.

150,KMI,UPDATE 1-Mercuria joins Kinder in Houston crude-by-rail terminal,"* 210,000 terminal could make Houston a more flexible oil hub * Big regional oil price gaps are leading to more rail transport * Kinder Morgan, Watco Companies to operate new terminal Feb 21 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan and Watco said on Thursday they will team with Swiss oil trader Mercuria to build a 210,000 barrel per day crude-by-rail terminal in Houston, the latest bet on railcars to ease major bottlenecks in U.S. oil markets. Crude-by-rail terminals are springing up as U.S. shale drilling expands and new pipelines lag behind, causing big regional oil price gaps, which allow traders like Mercuria to profit by moving crude quickly between regions. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and truck and rail operator Watco, which have a joint venture known as KW Express LLC, said they entered a long-term agreement with Mercuria, which will own 15 percent of the terminal on the Houston Ship Channel. The terminal will be complete in February, 2014, said Kinder spokesman Joe Hollier. Financial terms were not disclosed. Mercuria and Watco did not immediately respond to requests for further comment. The terminal will allow Mercuria to bring crude to the Gulf Coast refining complex from locations including Cushing, Oklahoma — the delivery site for U.S. crude futures contracts — and West Texas, the Bakken Shale or western Canada. It will also load crude and condensates onto trains or barges for shipment elsewhere, with capacity to handle three large unit trains per day, and additional barge offloading capacity of 100,000 bpd. Hollier said “interim facilities” should be ready by August, allowing for crude arriving at the terminal to be transferred into a distribution system operated by Magellan Midstream . Barge facilities will be ready in November. The terminal, which will also feature 500,000 barrels of tank storage for crude and condensates, will tie into a Magellan terminal that delivers crude to Houston refiners, while barge deliveries can reach other refineries around the Gulf Coast, Hollier said. “This will be the first major crude-by-rail destination facility in the Houston area with the ability to deliver into the largest refining complex in the world,” said John Schlosser, Kinder Morgan Terminals president, in a release. Shipping crude by rail is more expensive than by pipeline, but due to logistics bottlenecks, a barrel of light crude on the Gulf Coast can fetch a premium of $20 or more per barrel versus prices in the midcontinent. The oil price gap between the Gulf and Western Canada can be $40 or more. “They’ll have unit train capacity to drop off different grades of crude along the Gulf Coast and capture those big price differentials,” said Jason Stevens, an analyst who covers energy companies for Morningstar in Chicago. “It’s a very flexible way to operate. The loading capacity also means they can take light condensates from the Eagle Ford region of Texas to Canada, where it can be used as a diluent for Canadian heavy crude.” Mercuria already holds oil and gas stakes in Western Canada and the Bakken Shale of North Dakota, and controls crude storage assets in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery site for U.S. oil futures. Pipeline giant Kinder and logistics firm Watco said in 2011 that they planned to build several U.S. crude-by-rail terminals around the country. Railroads have been reporting growing profits from crude by rail, and among the other energy firms betting on it are independent U.S. oil refiners Valero and PBF Energy Inc.

151,KMI,UPDATE 1-Kinder Morgan seeks to send more natgas from U.S. to Mexico,"By Jeanine Prezioso NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc’s  Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC (KMTP) requested authorization from U.S. federal energy regulators to allow it to ship more natural gas from Texas to Mexico as companies line up to capitalize on the domestic natural gas shale boom. Kinder Morgan on Friday filed an application with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to amend a presidential permit and authorization under the Natural Gas Act to permit it to ship 700 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of natural gas on the Mier-Monterrey pipeline from the existing 425 mmcfd. “The increase in capability to move gas through the existing cross-border facilities will be accomplished by system modifications to nonjurisdictional facilities upstream of KMTP’s cross-border facility,” Kinder said in the filing. The 95-mile Mier-Monterrey pipeline runs through international borders between Starr County, Texas, into Monterrey, Mexico, where it connects to a 1,000 megawatt power plant complex and into Pemex-Gas Y Petroquimica Basica’s  natural gas transportation system, Kinder said on its website. Pemex currently ships gas on the pipeline. Kinder is asking for the authorization by no later than June 1. A Kinder spokesman said the company had “no announcements regarding customers or additional color to provide at this time.” Natural gas producers have fine-tuned a technology known as “hydraulic fracturing” or “fracking” that has let loose reams of natural gas from horizontal layers of rock below ground. Firms who had invested in terminals to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) into the U.S. are now looking to convert them and build new terminals to export gas as production has grown. Prices for the fuel on the global market fetch at times five-to-six times the U.S. price. Exporting natural gas has become a hot button issue as supplies have grown. The U.S. Department of Energy commissioned a study on LNG exports which was released in December to both supporters and detractors who fear exports would mean rising prices for U.S. consumers. In the scenarios considered in the study “benefits that come from export expansion more than outweigh the losses from reduced capital and wage income to U.S. consumers, and hence LNG exports have net economic benefits in spite of higher domestic natural gas prices,” it said.",3062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/kinder-gaspipeline-mexico/update-1-kinder-morgan-seeks-to-send-more-natgas-from-u-s-to-mexico-idUSL1N0BYHGY20130306

153,KMI,UPDATE 2-Kinder Morgan launches open season on crude pipeline,"* Pipeline would carry cheaper Texas crude to California * Construction would start 2015 with 2016 startup * Project could potentially cost $2 billion By Kristen Hays HOUSTON, April 2 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP launched a binding open season on Tuesday to gauge shipper interest in a pipeline that would move cheap U.S. crude from Texas to import-dependent California refineries. Dubbed the Freedom Pipeline, the project would involve converting a 740-mile (1,191 km) natural gas pipeline to move crude oil from the Permian Basin, as well as construction of new pipelines and pumping stations. In January, Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Richard Kinder told analysts the potentially $2 billion project could move up to 400,000 barrels per day, but would be profitable at 250,000 bpd. On Tuesday, the company said it would have an initial capacity of 277,000 bpd. Bill Day, a spokesman for Valero Energy Corp, the nation’s largest independent refiner, said the company is interested in bringing low-cost crude to California. Valero operates refineries in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. “We like different options to do that,” he said, whether it be crude via pipeline, rail or ship. He declined to comment specifically on Kinder Morgan’s plans. California is the last region in the United States to gain access to cheaper inland crude oil from prolific shale and tight oil plays that already have increased profitability for refiners elsewhere. There are no major pipelines that carry crude west over the Rocky Mountains, leaving California dependent on expensive imports and declining output from the state and Alaska. Some California refiners want to tap the cheaper inland output by rail, or offload it from ships or barges that take loads from trains that deliver it to the west coasts of Canada or Washington State. Alon Energy USA Inc shut down its 84,500 bpd Southern California refining system last fall for at least a year as it awaits permits to build an offloading facility that can receive crude by rail. Valero also is seeking a permit to build a similar facility that could take to 70,000 bpd of inland U.S. and Canadian crude via rail. Pending needed shipper interest and regulatory approvals,    Kinder Morgan would begin construction by June 2015 with startup set for the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2016, the company said. In addition to converting the 740-mile natural gas pipeline to move crude, Kinder Morgan would build 22 miles (35.4 km) of new pipeline for interconnections in Southern California and 200 miles (321.9 km)of pipeline between Wink and El Paso in West Texas. The company also would build tank facilities in the receipt area of Wink and Midland, Texas, and at delivery points in California. The entire system would stretch 1,025 miles (1,649 km).",4022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/kindermorgan-pipeline-california/update-2-kinder-morgan-launches-open-season-on-crude-pipeline-idUSL2N0CP1QZ20130402

156,KMI,UPDATE 1-Kinder Morgan may further expand Houston condensate facility,"HOUSTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  may further expand an already expanded condensate splitter planned at its Galena Park terminal along the Houston Ship Channel, Chief Executive Rich Kinder told analysts on Wednesday. “We think there may be opportunity to add even additional volumes on a going forward basis,” he said during the company’s first-quarter earnings conference call. Kinder Morgan last month said it would increase the facility’s processing capability by 40,000 barrels per day to 100,000 barrels per day and add 700,000 barrels of storage capacity for a total of 1.9 million barrels. The expansion increased the cost to $360 million from $200 million. The first phase will start up next year, followed by the second phase in 2015, Kinder said. In response to an analyst’s question, Kinder later said the company’s 300,000 barrels per day crude/condensate pipeline that originates in the Eagle Ford shale oil play in Texas is moving growing volumes of condensate. The line started up in June last year. Kinder said the initial contract with BHP Billiton  was for 25,000 barrels per day and is doubling. “That throughput alone is sufficient to make it a very viable project economically,” Kinder added. The company since struck a deal with Phillips 66 to build a lateral pipeline to the refiner’s 247,000 bpd refinery in Sweeny, Texas, with an initial capacity of 65,000 bpd expandable to 100,000 bpd. Kinder said Phillips has taken about 20,000 bpd of additional capacity so far. He added that Kinder Morgan expects to add two more customers that will need up to 50,000 bpd more in capacity. “We see that is going to be an extraordinarily good investment for us because there’s just a lot of people, a lot of producers want to get to the Houston Ship Channel,” Kinder said. “That helped us secure the contract to build the condensate splitter.”",4172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/kindermorgan-condensate/update-1-kinder-morgan-may-further-expand-houston-condensate-facility-idUSL2N0D42KW20130417

159,KMI,UPDATE 1-Kinder Morgan to expand Eagle Ford crude pipeline,"* Expansion will increase capacity to 100,000 bpd * Slated to be finished by end of 2013 HOUSTON, May 2 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  will expand a pipeline under construction to move crude oil from the Eagle Ford shale oil play in Texas to Phillips 66’s  247,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Sweeny, Texas, the company said on Thursday. Kinder Morgan is building a 27-mile, 12-inch lateral pipeline to the Sweeny refinery from its 300,000 bpd crude and condensate pipeline that moves Eagle Ford output to the Houston Ship Channel. The larger pipeline started up in June last year. The lateral pipeline’s initial capacity was 30,000 bpd, but Kinder Morgan said it will increase to 100,000 bpd. The company will add new pumps and an additional 120,000-barrel storage tank at its pump station in Wharton County, Texas. Kinder Morgan also will increase truck offload capabilities at its station in DeWitt County, Texas, to further facilitate the capacity hike. The lateral project is slated to be finished at the end of 2013. The Eagle Ford play’s close proximity to the U.S. Gulf Coast, home to more than 40 percent of the nation’s refining capacity, has given refiners access to growing output that is cheaper than global crudes. Kinder Morgan also is a major player in developing infrastructure to move that output to refining centers. The Sweeny lateral’s expansion will help that refinery increase its use of Eagle Ford crude as well.

The projects come as crude and condensate output from the Eagle Ford shale oil play in Texas is booming and in turn prompting infrastructure to catch up and to move it to markets. Kinder Morgan said it would invest $106 million to buy about 20 acres of land adjacent to the Pasadena terminal to support a future crude and condensate terminal that can handle 10 tanks with 150,000 barrels of capacity each. That project would be connected to the Explorer Pipeline, the company said. The nine new tanks at the Galena Park terminal will have a storage capacity of 1.2 million barrels. The new barge dock will enhance existing infrastructure at Kinder Morgan’s Pasadena terminal, the company said, with capacity to handle up to 50 barges each month. Last month Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Rich Kinder said a lot of producers want to move crude and condensate output from the Eagle Ford shale oil play in Texas to the Houston Ship Channel.

162,KMI,Kinder Morgan announces expansion of BOSTCO terminal project,"HOUSTON, June 5 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  will expand a $485 million diesel, residual fuel and black oil terminal project under construction on the Houston Ship Channel by 900,000 barrels, the company said on Wednesday. The expansion of the joint-venture Battleground Oil Specialty Terminal Company LLC (BOSTCO) project will add six 150,000-barrel ultra-low-sulfur diesel tanks, more pipeline and deepwater vessel dock access and a faster loading rate. The expansion is supported by a long-term contract with Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. In the joint venture with TransMontaigne Partners LP , Kinder Morgan operates and owns a 55 percent interest in the facility. The initial phase of the BOSTCO terminal is slated to start up in the third quarter this year, with the expansion to start up in the fourth quarter of 2014. With the expansion, the project’s capacity will be 7.1 million barrels in 57 storage tanks. Charles Dunlap, chief executive officer of TransMontaigne, last month told analysts that the project can add another 3 million barrels of storage.

163,KMI,UPDATE 2-Kinder Morgan shuts Trans Mountain oil line after small spill,"CALGARY, Alberta, June 13 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP has shut its 307,000-barrel-per-day Trans Mountain crude oil pipeline after a spill of about 12 barrels of oil was detected near Kingsvale, British Columbia, the company said on Thursday. Repairs were underway the line, which runs west across the Canadian Rockies from Edmonton, Alberta, to the Vancouver area and Puget Sound, but the company did not have details on when flows will resume. Kinder Morgan spokesman Andrew Galarnyk said the company will need approval from Canada’s National Energy Board before the line can restart. News of the spill, though relatively small, could intensify environmental opposition to expanding the 1,150-kilometre (715-mile) pipeline, which transports batches of crude oil, refined and semi-refined products. Kinder Morgan has plans to nearly triple the capacity of the Trans Mountain line to 890,000 barrels per day. It is currently the only pipeline transporting crude from the oil sands of northern Alberta to the West Coast. The company shut the line on Wednesday afternoon when light crude oil was first spotted on the surface of the pipeline’s right of way during routine maintenance. “The release area is fully contained and there is no impact to any water course and no threat to the public. Early indications are that the volume is small at less than two cubic meters (12 barrels),” Galarnyk said in a statement. Canadian cash crude prices fell in early trade on news of the Trans Mountain spill, before rebounding. Western Canada Select heavy blend for July delivery last traded at $11.00 per barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, while light synthetic crude from the oil sands traded at a premium of $12.50 per barrel to WTI, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers.",6132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/transmountain-pipeline-spill/update-2-kinder-morgan-shuts-trans-mountain-oil-line-after-small-spill-idUSL2N0EP0SY20130613

165,KMI,Canada regulator denies Chevron bid to secure oil for refinery,"* Regulator denies bid for priority pipeline access * Says Chevron refinery able to operate under current conditions * Asks Kinder Morgan to revise allocation procedures CALGARY, Alberta, July 11 (Reuters) - Canada’s National Energy Board has turned down Chevron Corp’s bid to secure priority access to oil shipped on the Trans Mountain pipeline for its British Columbia refinery, arguing the facility could operate using existing supply sources. Chevron had sought to secure supply for its 55,000 barrel per day refinery in Burnaby because it was having difficulty ensuring it could source enough oil on the chronically over-booked pipeline, which carries Alberta crude to British Columbia and Puget Sound, to keep the refinery operating. The board, which regulates the Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP -owned line, said the refinery had been consistently able to meet its 40,000 barrel per day minimum run rate despite the lack of secure space on the 300,000 bpd Trans Mountain line. “The Board was of the view that it is the responsibility of Chevron to design a portfolio of supply options that will best mitigate its supply risk and ensure the long-term viability of the Burnaby Refinery,” the regulator said in a statement. Chevron sought priority access for the refinery, which supplies a third of British Columbia’s gasoline, last year, after Kinder Morgan reduced the amount of space on the line available to spot shippers. Space on the line has been rationed since 2010, with would-be shippers seeking to ship more crude than the line could carry. The board said Kinder Morgan must revise the procedures it uses to allocate space on the line or explain why its current methods are adequate by the end of September. A spokesman for Chevron said the company will comment after it has reviewed the decision.

166,KMI,Kinder Morgan eyes participating in condensate exports,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP KMP.N expects to participate in export facilities for condensate from the Eagle Ford shale oil play in Texas, Chief Executive Richard Kinder told analysts on Wednesday. “We are working with expanding our reach into the Eagle Ford and the ability to handle more and more condensate,” Kinder said. “I think there will be additional export of products.” Kinder Morgan is building a splitter at its Galena Park terminal along the Houston Ship Channel to process the extra-light condensate that is produced with crude oil from the Texas play. Those very light hydrocarbons can be sold as crude oil, a diluent to blend with heavy crude oil such as that produced in Canada, or they can be processed and exported like refined products. Last year Kinder Morgan started up a 300,000 barrel per day crude and condensate pipeline that moves Eagle Ford to the ship channel facilities, and is expanding it to hook into output from a ConocoPhillips (COP.N) operation. The splitter project also has been expanded to add a second unit for a total capacity of 100,000 bpd. In addition, the company’s joint-venture 100,000 bpd Double Eagle Pipeline LLC with Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP.N) started up in May and moves Eagle Ford condensate from Three Rivers to Corpus Christi, Texas. He said as condensate output increases, exports will help relieve expected bottlenecks. Kinder Morgan is looking at export facilities partly in conjunction with its joint-venture Battleground Oil Specialty Terminal Company LLC (BOSTCO) project. The $485 million diesel, residual fuel and black oil terminal project is under construction along the ship channel. “That’s not the original purpose of it,” he said of that project and condensate exports, “but we certainly have land down there and we will be able to participate in export facilities,” Kinder said.

167,KMI,"Keyera, Kinder Morgan to build new Canada crude-by-rail terminal","CALGARY, Alberta, July 30 (Reuters) - Keyera Corp  and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP announced on Tuesday a $98 million joint venture to build a crude oil rail-loading terminal in Edmonton, Alberta, one of the main storage hubs for Canada’s oil sands. The project is the latest development to cater to the growing demand among Canadian producers, frustrated by apportionment on congested pipelines, to use railways to export crude south to U.S. markets. Midstream operator Keyera said the 50-50 joint venture rail-loading facility will be able to load about 40,000 barrels per day of crude oil and deliver to refineries anywhere in North America. Keyera’s share of the cost of the Alberta crude terminal is expected to be about $65 million, while pipeline company Kinder Morgan is expected to spend $33 million. “Kinder Morgan’s access to multiple crude streams, together with our location and facility capabilities, combines crude oil supply with the necessary infrastructure, land and rail connectivity to help address some of the crude oil delivery constraints currently being experienced by the Alberta energy sector,” Keyera President and Chief Operating Officer David Smith said. The construction of the terminal is underpinned by a five-year agreement with a major refiner, the company added.",7302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-rail-terminal/keyera-kinder-morgan-to-build-new-canada-crude-by-rail-terminal-idUSL1N0G024V20130730
168,KMI,Fitch Affirms Kinder Morgan Inc. and El Paso LLC at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDR) for Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI) and El Paso LLC (EP, formerly El Paso  Corporation) at 'BB+'. Both KMI and EP have Stable Rating Outlooks. EP is a  wholly-owned subsidiary of KMI and its debt is cross-guaranteed and ratably  secured with KMI. A complete list of KMI and EP ratings follows at the end of this release.  Approximately $5 billion of KMI debt and $4.3 billion EP debt is affected by  today's rating action.  KMI is the owner of the general partner (GP) and approximately 11% limited  partner (LP) interests in Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (KMP, Fitch IDR  'BBB', Stable Outlook). Through its ownership of EP, KMI is the owner of the GP  and approximately 43% LP interests in El Paso Pipeline Partners L.P. (El Paso  Pipeline Partners Operating Company, IDR 'BBB-', Stable Outlook). In  addition, KMI has a 20% interest in NGPL PipeCo LLC (NGPL, IDR 'B', Stable  Outlook).   KEY RATING DRIVERS Rating Rationale: KMI's and EP's ratings and Stable Rating Outlooks reflect the  significant scale of consolidated operations, the quality and diversity of  assets held by their operating master limited partnerships (MLPs), and the  favorable implications of future asset dropdowns on KMI's leverage metrics.  Fitch expects these metrics will improve as KMI drops assets down to its MLPs  and uses the resulting proceeds to de-lever. KMI is now the third largest energy  company in the U.S. with a consolidated enterprise value of approximately $115  billion. KMI's May 2012, acquisition of EP has resulted in reduced consolidated  business risk given the cash flow stability associated with EP's interstate  pipelines. Approximately 78% of consolidated 2013 cash flow will come from its  lowest risk natural gas and petroleum products pipelines and terminal segments.  The CO2 oil production operations at KMP which are exposed to commodity price  and volumes will contribute 14%. Post-merger dropdowns include the sales of Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (TGP, IDR  'BBB', Stable Outlook) and El Paso Natural Gas Co. (EPNG, IDR 'BBB', Stable  Outlook) to KMP and Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Co., and the remaining 14% of  Colorado Interstate Gas Co. (IDR 'BBB', Stable Outlook) to EPB. Sale proceeds  have been applied to debt reduction. KMI's 50% interests in Ruby Pipeline LLC  (IDR 'BBB-', Stable Outlook) and Citrus Corp. are expected to be dropped down to  the MLPs in 2014.   Given KMI's consolidated business risk, Fitch believes that appropriate leverage  for a 'BB+' rating as measured by the total standalone debt of KMI and EP to  cash from operations should be 3.5x or below. In Fitch's base case forecast, KMI  should be able to attain this metric on a pro forma basis in 2013, with  standalone parent company leverage expected to drop further to 3.0x or below in  2014 with the benefit of the dropdowns and related debt repayment.   Other considerations and concerns for KMI's ratings include the structural  subordination of its cash flows to debt repayment at its operating MLPs,  aggressive capital spending at the MLPs, exposure to changes in natural gas  liquids (NGL) and oil prices, and exposure to volume risk for KMP's CO2 and  midstream business segments. However, the financial impact of commodity price  volatility is minimized through hedges which have been applied to approximately  80% of expected oil production for the remainder of 2013. Also considered is the  board-authorized repurchase of up to $350 million of warrants or common stock of  KMI that would likely be funded with debt. However, unless future equity  repurchases significantly exceed the current authorized amounts, KMI's leverage  metrics would remain appropriate for its 'BB+' rating. Liquidity is adequate: KMI has access to a $1.75 billion secured revolving  credit facility that matures December 2014. EP's revolver and the revolver that  had been utilized for EP's oil and gas business were repaid and terminated when  its merger with KMI closed. At June 30, 2013, $1.35 billion was outstanding  under the KMI revolver. KMI as a holding company has limited future borrowing  needs. Its largest operating affiliates are self-financing with generally  favorable capital market access. KMI's near-term debt maturities are manageable.  EP has $30 million of notes maturing in 2013 and $207 million of notes maturing  mid-2014 while cash proceeds from planned 2014 dropdowns to the MLPs could  exceed $2 billion and will allow KMI to repay its term loan due 2015 with a  current balance of $1.528 billion and reduce its revolver. The revolver has a  6.0x leverage test. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include:  --A lessening of consolidated business risk as the company acquires and expands  pipeline and fixed-fee businesses;  --A rating upgrade to KMP;  --A material improvement in credit metrics with sustained standalone parent  leverage below 2.0x. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --Increasing leverage at KMI's operating affiliates to support organic growth  and acquisitions;  --A rating downgrade to KMP;  --A weakening of credit metrics with sustained standalone parent leverage above  4.0x. The following ratings have been affirmed by Fitch with a Stable Outlook: Kinder Morgan, Inc. --IDR at 'BB+'; --Secured notes and debentures at 'BB+'; --Secured revolving credit facility at 'BB+'; --3-year term loan facility at 'BB+'. Kinder Morgan Finance Company, LLC --Secured notes at 'BB+'. KN Capital Trust I --Trust preferred at 'BB-'. KN Capital Trust III --Trust preferred at 'BB-'. El Paso LLC --IDR 'BB+'; --Senior secured notes and debentures at 'BB+'. El Paso Energy Capital Trust I --Trust convertible preferred securities at 'BB-'.

169,KMI,Young analyst draws Wall Street ire taking on Kinder Morgan,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Kevin Kaiser, a 26-year-old analyst only three years into his first job out of the Ivy League, jolted Wall Street last week with a pithy email taking aim at North America’s largest oil and gas pipeline and processing company - Kinder Morgan. The email, sent to clients of independent research firm Hedgeye Risk Management, said Kinder Morgan and its associated companies “is a house of cards, completely misunderstood and mispriced.” No specifics were provided, but the missive and his comments on Twitter spooked investors who shaved $4 billion off the company’s market capitalization and sent Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) shares down 6 percent last Wednesday. Analysts are not certain why Kaiser’s comments resonated with so many investors, but they underscore the growing influence of social media like Twitter, which can deliver investment information - accurate or not - to thousands in seconds at the push of a button. Some compared the market to a circus. “Here is your PT Barnum people,” one user tweeted as Kaiser caused a firestorm on Twitter and prompted people to question his experience. “It seems a little surprising that enough people would be spooked by unsupported assertions,” said Jason Stevens, an analyst at Morningstar. The email titled “New Best Idea: Short Kinder Morgan,” was a teaser for a report to be issued on Tuesday. No analysis was provided: only seven bullet points with topics that the report will address, including the valuation of the company’s sprawling oil and gas business, which has surged as exploration companies tap into shale deposits driving a U.S. energy boom. Kaiser declined to comment on the email. Kinder Morgan did not comment. But Rich Kinder, the billionaire former Enron executive who is chairman of Kinder Morgan, bought opportunistically on the dip. On Monday, he purchased about $18 million of stock in Kinder Morgan Inc, according to an SEC filing. Kinder Morgan has a complex corporate structure, which includes four publicly traded entities: Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP KMP.N, Kinder Morgan Management LLC KMR.N and El Paso Pipeline Partners EPB.N. Combined, the companies have a market capitalization of about $90 billion. It is made of master limited partnerships (MLPs), a structure favored by energy companies for tax efficiency and a lower cost of capital. Income is not taxed and paid out to investors, called unitholders, in the form of quarterly distributions. Kaiser studied economics at Princeton University and was a member of the university’s hockey team. He wrote an initial report on Kinder Morgan on August 2 that questioned the company’s valuation. Wall Street sell-side analysts rushed to the company’s defense, issuing notes and articles that took aim at Kaiser’s credibility. The steep decline in Kinder Morgan shares is a buying opportunity, they argued. John Edwards, energy analyst at Credit Suisse, in a note to clients on September 5 characterized Kinder Morgan as one of the most undervalued MLPs and said the company has “earned the trust of investors established over a very long period of time.” Igor Greenwald, the editor of MLP Profits, wrote a column for his clients on September 5 that characterized the sell-off as “investing at its most pathetic and absurd.” He described Kaiser as “a 26-year-old man with a fancy title and very limited work experience.” The sell-off may be explained by the fact that in general, MLPs have high ownership by less sophisticated retail investors, Greenwald speculated. “That kind of shareholding class is vulnerable to scare mongering,” said Greenwald. Kaiser may also have gained some credibility with investors by writing about accounting issues at Linn Energy LLC LINE.O and LinnCo LNCO.O. Linn Energy said on July 2 that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had launched an informal inquiry into accounting issues and its proposed purchase of Berry Petroleum Co BRY.N. “Perhaps because he tilted his lance at Linn, with some results, you’ve got people who are in the stock and want to get out,” Morningstar analyst Stevens said.

171,KMI,Upstart analyst says Kinder 'starves' assets for investors,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - An analyst who has drawn criticism from Wall Street for making incendiary comments about Kinder Morgan claimed on Tuesday the U.S. pipeline company has cut maintenance work to boost cash distributed to investors in its partnerships. In a 45-page note to clients, Kevin Kaiser, a 26-year-old analyst with independent research firm Hedgeye Risk Management, cited several examples in which he said the Houston company had reduced maintenance spending. A copy of the note was seen by Reuters. “Our research suggests that Kinder Morgan’s high-level business strategy in its pipeline segments is to starve the assets of routine maintenance expenses and capex in order to maximize DC (distributable cash flow),” he wrote in an analysis of numbers provided to investors by the company and companies it has acquired. Shares of the four publicly-traded entities that comprise Kinder Morgan — including Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), Kinder Morgan Energy Partners KMP.N, El Paso Pipeline Partners LP EPB.N and Kinder Morgan Management LLC KMR.N — shrugged off the report and each rose more than 1 percent. “Our business units perform a bottom up review of maintenance capital needs and operating expenses, with the objective being to increasingly reduce risk and improve safety for the benefit of the public and the environment,” Kinder Morgan said in a statement provided to Reuters. The company did not address the details of Kaiser’s report. Last week, shares of Kinder Morgan Inc fell 6 percent after Kaiser sent an email to clients that urged them to short the company. The same email promised a bombshell report - the one released on Tuesday - that would expose Kinder Morgan as “a house of cards. Wall Street analysts who have a favorable view of the company said some of the issues Kaiser raised about Kinder Morgan’s treatment of maintenance have been raised in years past. They and other investors have criticized Kaiser as a relative newcomer to the industry, with about three years of experience. Jason Stevens, an analyst with Morningstar who follows Kinder Morgan, said in a note last week that he found that the company’s “maintenance capex is broadly in line with MLP industry practices.” According to Kaiser, Kinder has cut nearly in half the amount of maintenance capital it spends on the pipeline assets it acquired in its $30 billion purchase of El Paso Corp in 2012. Kinder did not comment on this example El Paso previously had forecast it would need $91 million of maintenance capex for 2012, while Kinder spent $46 million on the same assets in 2012, according to Kaiser’s research report. Kinder did not comment on this example. “Not only did Kinder Morgan sharply reduce maintenance capex on the former El Paso subsidiaries, but also maintenance expenses,” the analyst wrote. Kinder Morgan reports capital expenditures for both growth and maintenance for its individual business units in annual presentations to analysts. Kinder is comprised of master limited partnerships (MLPs), a structure favored by energy companies for tax efficiency and a lower cost of capital. Income is not taxed and paid out to investors is paid to investors in the form of a quarterly payout.

172,KMI,Kinder Morgan chairman denies skimping on maintenance,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan’s billionaire chairman on Wednesday denied the U.S. pipeline company skimps on maintenance spending, hitting back at allegations by a young analyst that have rattled the company’s shares. The analyst, Kevin Kaiser, 26, of research firm Hedgeye Risk Management, published a 45-page report on September 10 alleging, among other things, that Kinder Morgan has cut maintenance work to boost cash distributed to investors in its partnerships. “Our policy is not, is not to skimp on maintenance capex,” Chairman Rich Kinder told investors on a conference call held specifically to discuss Kaiser’s report. “We believe our policy and actions on maintaining our pipelines are correct and appropriate,” he added. Shares of Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) rose 4 percent after the conference call. Four publicly-traded companies comprise Kinder Morgan: Kinder Morgan Inc, El Paso Pipeline Partners LP EPB.N, Kinder Morgan Management LLC KMR.N, and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners KMP.N, which operates most pipeline assets. Before the Hedgeye report was published, Kaiser sent an email to his firm’s clients and went on Twitter to recommend investors short Kinder Morgan. The email contributed to a 6 percent decline in Kinder Morgan shares the day it was released and generated a lot of buzz on Twitter and on Wall Street. Publication of his report came several days later and had little effect on the shares. As an example in the report, Kaiser said El Paso spent $499 million to maintain five natural pipelines in 2011, while Kinder Morgan expects to spend just $132 million on the same assets in 2013. Kinder Morgan acquired El Paso in 2012. Rich Kinder said on the conference call that Kaiser’s $499 million figure included $160 million for a Florida pipeline that Kinder Morgan does not operate. He also said some of Kinder Morgan’s spending on pipeline maintenance is classified as an operations expense. He said this was one reason maintenance spending on the El Paso assets was lower. Kinder Morgan also spends less on items like technology than El Paso did, he said. Hedgeye’s Kaiser said on Wednesday that he stands by his claims. “Kinder Morgan is implying that they are expensing a significant amount of maintenance that El Paso previously capitalized,” Kaiser said in an email. “However, the data does not suggest that is the case. Maintenance expenses on the major El Paso subsidiaries are down significantly since the acquisition.” ",9182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kindermorgan-maintenance/kinder-morgan-chairman-denies-skimping-on-maintenance-idUSBRE98H10L20130918

176,KMI,Kinder Morgan to build an extension to Eagle Ford pipeline,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners on Wednesday said it has agreed with an unnamed Eagle Ford oil producer to extend its 300,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) Kinder Morgan Crude Condensate (KMCC) pipeline farther into the southern Texas shale field. Houston, Texas-based Kinder Morgan said it will build an 18-mile, 24-inch (0.45 meter) diameter, 300,000 bpd lateral that will connect to the KMCC line at a station in DeWitt, Texas and extend to a facility in Gonzales county. Kinder Morgan will build 300,000 barrels of storage capacity, complete with trucking offloading capability, at the new facility, the company said in a press release. The project is expected to cost nearly $74 million. A company spokeswoman declined to say which Eagle Ford producer was involved in the deal. Kinder Morgan began construction on another lateral connected to the KMCC pipeline in July, which will extend 31 miles to a ConocoPhillips central delivery facility. That lateral is supported by a long-term contract with Conoco. Another extension on this line will carry Eagle Ford crude oil and condensate to Phillips 66’s 247,000 bpd refinery in Sweeney, Texas. That line will soon be completed, the company said. Oil companies produced just below 600,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) of oil in the Eagle Ford shale in July, 36 percent more than during the same month a year ago, preliminary data from the Railroad Commission of Texas shows.

The project also includes two pipelines that will connect to five Cushing destinations and, once finished, will be able to handle 350,000 barrels of oil per day, Kinder Morgan said. Kinder Morgan has a 51 percent stake in the Deeprock facility and said it would invest $26 million of the total $52 million project cost.

181,KMI,UPDATE 2-Kinder Morgan applies to expand Trans Mountain pipeline,"By Nia Williams CALGARY, Alberta, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP filed an application with Canadian regulators on Monday to nearly treble the capacity of its Trans Mountain crude oil pipeline to 890,000 barrels per day. The facilities application to the National Energy Board (NEB) is the next step in Kinder Morgan’s bid to expand the existing 300,000 bpd line that runs from Edmonton, Alberta to Vancouver, British Columbia. The company filed preliminary plans on the C$5.4 billion ($5.10 billion) project with the NEB earlier this year. The 715 mile (1,150 km) Trans Mountain line is the only pipeline running from Alberta’s vast oil sands to Canada’s Pacific coast and the proposed expansion has received strong support from producers keen to export their crude to international markets. The NEB will establish a hearing schedule for a public regulatory review of the project. If approved, Kinder Morgan expects the expanded pipeline to start operating in late 2017. Canada’s oil industry is relying on new pipelines to transport booming production out of Alberta and alleviate steep price discounts on oil sands crude. Industry groups welcomed the filing. “The Trans Mountain project ... represents one of several transportation infrastructure projects needed to help Canadians realize full value and benefits for the resources they own,” said Greg Stringham, vice president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). The expanded pipeline would primarily carry heavy crude oil, the bulk of which would be loaded onto tankers at Kinder Morgan’s Vancouver marine terminal, Ian Anderson, president of Kinder Morgan Canada, told reporters on a conference call. He expected most of the crude would be shipped to Asia and California. Kinder Morgan said 73 percent of the proposed expansion route will follow the existing right-of-way. The company has also recommended enhancements to marine safety procedures, including extending tug escorts and establishing moving safety zones of 500 metres or more around tankers to reduce the risk of collisions. Anderson said the company was confident the application would satisfy the five conditions set out by British Columbia Premier Christy Clark last year, for the province to support the construction of oil pipelines. “We are not going to prejudge the process and we are not going to prejudge the project itself,” said British Columbia environment minister Mary Polak, adding the province would likely seek intervener status in the NEB hearings. “We are encouraged by Kinder Morgan’s willingness to work with us to satisfy those conditions but there’s still a great deal of work to be done as we go through the review process.” Environmental groups, concerned about the impact of developing Alberta’s oil sands, have opposed plans to expand and develop Canadian export pipelines. TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL project still awaits U.S. presidential approval six years after it was first proposed, while Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway pipeline to Kitimat, BC is waiting for a preliminary regulatory decision from the NEB by month-end. Kinder Morgan said 13 shippers had committed to take approximately 708,000 bpd of capacity on the expanded line and there was little risk of new pipeline capacity outpacing demand. “If you look at what CAPP forecasts for production of heavy oil especially over the next decade there will be enough oil supply to fill all of these projects that are being proposed today,” Kinder’s Anderson said. CAPP expects oil sands production to hit 4.5 million bpd by 2025, up from 1.8 million bpd in 2012. The existing 300,000 bpd Trans Mountain pipeline is routinely oversubscribed, prompting Kinder Morgan to ration the amount of crude shippers can transport. That pipeline apportionment contributes to crude getting bottlenecked in Alberta, resulting in Canadian heavy crude trading as much as $40 per barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark last month.

182,KMI,Kinder Morgan files application to expand Trans Mountain pipeline,"CALGARY, Alberta, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP filed an application with Canadian regulators on Monday to build the facilities necessary to expand its Trans Mountain crude oil pipeline to 890,000 barrels per day. The facilities application to the National Energy Board is a formal regulatory document and the crucial next step in Kinder Morgan’s bid to nearly treble the capacity of its 300,000 bpd line that runs from Edmonton, Alberta, to the coast of British Columbia. Kinder Morgan filed preliminary plans with the NEB earlier this year. The NEB will now establish a hearing schedule to review the application, and the project will undergo a public regulatory review. If it is approved, Kinder Morgan expects the expanded pipeline to be operational in late 2017. “Our engagement efforts will continue beyond this filing leading up to the NEB hearing as we consider further input that is critical to our planning on this project,” Ian Anderson, president of Kinder Morgan Canada, said in an emailed statement. Thirteen customers have signed up as shippers on the expanded line, bringing the total committed capacity to approximately 708,000 bpd. The expansion project on the 1,150km pipeline is expected to cost C$5.4 billion ($5.10 billion). It is the only pipeline currently running from Alberta’s oil sands to Canada’s Pacific coast and has received strong support from producers keen to export their crude to Asia and other international markets.

183,KMI,NY Fed moves to dismiss suit brought by former Goldman examiner,"NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve Bank filed a motion on Friday to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a former employee who claimed she was fired after refusing to alter a critical examination of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The ex-employee, Carmen Segarra, said after examining Goldman’s legal and compliance divisions for seven months, she found the bank did not have policies to prevent conflicts of interest as required by regulation. In a 30-page court document, lawyers for the New York Fed said some of Segarra’s claims were “implausible owing to numerous contradictions within her pleading.” “Most glaringly, the allegation that Goldman Sachs did not  have any conflict of interest policy is belied by plaintiff’s own exhibits, which show that the ‘nonexistent’ policies were, in fact, available on Goldman Sachs’s public website,” the document said. Attorneys who filed the motion in federal court in the Southern District of New York and Segarra’s lawyer, Linda Stengle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson also did not respond to a request for comment. According to Segarra’s lawsuit, the New York Fed’s Legal Compliance and Risk team voted to downgrade Goldman’s annual rating pertaining to policies and procedures as a result of  findings. She alleges that two New York Fed officials overseeing the Wall Street bank, Michael Silva and his deputy Michael Koh, were concerned a downgrade would hurt the Goldman’s business. Both Koh and Silva are named as defendants in Segarra’s lawsuit, as well as her former supervisor, Johnathon Kim. Segarra was assigned to Goldman’s legal and compliance divisions from October 2011 until May 2012, and looked into three controversial transactions related to Solyndra, Capmark and the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan Inc. At that point, Kim, Silva and Koh fired her and had her escorted from the building by security guards after weeks of disputes and pressure to change her examination findings, the lawsuit said.

194,KMI,Kinder Morgan signs up customers for New England natgas pipeline,"July 31 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP  said natural gas distribution companies in New England have agreed to buy firm gas on the U.S. energy company’s proposed new pipeline into the region. A shortage of gas pipelines into New England forced energy firms there to pay record prices for gas supplies to heat homes and run a growing number of gas-fired power plants in the region during the recent unusually long and cold winter. The New England utilities agreed to transport about 0.5 billion cubic feet per day of long-term firm transportation on the proposed Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co (TGP) Northeast Energy Direct Project, Kinder Morgan said in a release on Wednesday. Included in the utility group are UIL Holdings Corp’s  Berkshire Gas Co, Connecticut Natural Gas Corp and Southern Connecticut Gas Co, NiSource Inc’s Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp’s  Liberty Utilities Corp, National Grid Plc, and three other utilities. Kinder said it was continuing negotiations with additional customers and expected to announce agreements soon. “Multiple studies continue to suggest there is a need for up to 2 billion cubic feet per day of new pipeline capacity into New England and neighboring markets,” Kinder Morgan Natural Gas Pipelines East Region President Kimberly Watson said in the release. The Northeast Energy Direct project can provide up to 2.2 bcf of gas per day depending on final customer commitments, Kinder Morgan said. The project, which will connect New England to the Marcellus shale gas fields in Pennsylvania, will include new pipelines and equipment in Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Kinder said it plans to begin the pre-filing process with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in September 2014, with the project expected to begin service in November 2018, subject to regulatory approvals. The Tennessee Gas Pipeline is a 13,900-mile (22,370-kilometer) pipeline that transports gas from Louisiana, the Gulf of Mexico and South Texas to the northeastern United States, including New York City and Boston.

195,KMI,UPDATE 3-Kinder Morgan to fold units into one company in $70 bln deal,"(Adds details on deal, concerns about MLPs, background) Aug 10 (Reuters) - Top U.S. pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc said on Sunday it will put all its publicly traded units under one roof  in a $70 billion deal that responds to investor concerns about its growth prospects and complicated financial structure. The oil and gas pipeline company said it would shed the tax-advantaged legal structure it had popularized during the U.S. shale boom, the Master Limited Partnership (MLP), and fold its units into one company with a market capitalization of $92 billion organized as a C-corporation. The affected units include Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP , Kinder Morgan Management, and El Paso Pipeline Partners. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rich Kinder had been under pressure from investors and last month on Kinder Morgan Partners’ second-quarter earnings call said combinations of the Kinder companies were being evaluated. A source familiar with the deal said Kinder Morgan’s overall valuation had suffered because it traded as four entities and the market struggled to understand it. The MLP structure also required the units to hand over much their cash to general partners, hurting its ability to make acquisitions that will now be easier to carry out, the source added. More broadly, MLPs have been coming under greater scrutiny. The Internal Revenue Service this year halted approvals for new ones that strayed from the traditional pipeline model, while some investors have said their weak corporate governance standards expose minority investors to added risks. The company expects the deal to close by the end of the year. “This combined entity will be the largest energy infrastructure company in North America and the third largest energy company overall,” CEO Kinder said in a statement. In a July note to clients, analysts at Houston-based investment bank Tudor, Pickering Holt said the Kinder companies had underperformed for the last two years, held back by a “stubbornly high cost of capital” even though since 2012 about $40 billion in deals were struck that were intended to jump-start growth. An email sent to clients of independent research firm Hedgeye Risk Management last year called Kinder Morgan and its associated companies “a house of cards.” Barclays and Citi acted as financial advisors to KMI, Barclays is providing committed financing for the transaction, and Weil Gotshal & Manges and Bracewell & Giuliani acted as legal counsel to KMI, according to the statement.

198,KMI,Top U.S. pipeline CEO Kinder sees new acquisitions; units soar,"HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The biggest U.S. pipeline company, Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), will be better able to acquire rivals after it consolidates as a single company and buys out investors in its publicly traded units for $44 billion, its CEO said on Monday. The North America midstream company already operates or has stakes in 80,000 miles of pipelines and there is growing demand for new infrastructure to handle surging output of oil and gas from the U.S. shale boom. Kinder Morgan’s shares closed 9 percent higher as investors embraced the deal, although it is expected to create significant tax bills for investors in two of its units: Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP KMP.N and El Paso Pipeline Partners LP EPB.N, which both rose around 20 percent. “We have such a broad platform, virtually anything in the midstream area would fit us,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rich Kinder told investors on a conference call. He did not name potential takeover targets, but said the company would not stray from its core business. For instance, he said it would not start buying “truck lines and railroads,” which increasingly have been used to move crude oil, but have drawn criticism after fiery accidents. Kinder Morgan said on Sunday it would put all its units under one roof. Investors had grown concerned the tax-advantaged Master Limited Partnership (MLP) structure that the Houston-based company popularized was hurting its growth and was too complicated. The companies had a market value of $92 billion before the deal was announced. Under the terms of the deal, it will consolidate its MLPs, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and El Paso Pipeline Partners, with Kinder Morgan Management LLC KMR.N and organize into a single C-corporation. The proposed deal makes sense for Kinder Morgan because the company had grown so large and was paying out so much of its cash to its general partners that it was hindered in making acquisitions by a higher cost of capital, Kinder said. Those payouts to general partners amounted to about 40 percent of profits, a source familiar with the deal said. “This is no way a swipe at MLPs in general,” Kinder told investors. Investors had penalized Kinder Morgan for having two MLPs that left it undervalued overall, while MLPs have come under increased scrutiny. The U.S. Treasury said on Monday it was looking at the proliferation of MLPs and their impact on tax revenues after the Internal Revenue Service halted approvals earlier this year for new MLPs that depart from the traditional pipeline model. The sector now has more than 100 energy MLPs.  On Wall Street, some investors have said the weak corporate governance standards of MLPs expose minority investors to more risks, while others have warned that any rise in U.S. interest rates could make MLPs less attractive. MLPs pay no taxes if they distribute the bulk of their profits to investors. But the structures can become unwieldy. The biggest MLPs face pressure to increase distributions for yield-hungry investors, even as general partners are often entitled to bigger payouts if certain performance thresholds are met. Kinder Chief Financial Officer Kimberly Dang said the transaction will be tax-free for holders of Kinder Morgan Management shares, which is a C-corporation, while investors in the Kinder MLPs will be taxed on capital gains and ordinary income. Investors said the tax setback would be temporary. “This is a taxable transaction, so that may be a short term hit for people,” said Quinn Kiley, of Advisory Research Inc, which manages over $6 billion in MLP companies. “The reality is when you have a big tax payment, it’s because you’ve made a lot of money. It’s a good problem to have.” Greg Reid of asset management firm Salient, which owns Kinder Morgan units, said the company would be able to tap a wider pool of investors as many cannot buy MLPs. “(This) opens up the universe to a lot more institutional buyers,” Reid said. Some other MLPs with lagging growth could follow Kinder’s lead and organize as a single company, but investors said Kinder Morgan’s case was unique and a mass departure from the MLP structure was unlikely. “I really don’t think it’s the start of a trend. The factors that drove this ... (were) specific to Kinder,” said Kevin McCarthy, head of Kayne Anderson, a company that invests in MLPs. One banker mentioned Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP.N), a fellow midstream company, as a candidate for reorganization. Another banker who asked not to be identified by name mentioned as a potential takeover candidate Targa Resources Partners LP NGLS.N, which said in June that merger talks with Energy Transfer fell through. Neither company was available to comment.         The shares of other large-cap MLPs were up across the board, in part because Kinder Morgan’s consolidation means its units will exit two key MLP indexes. That will create space for other MLPs. In morning trading Monday, the benchmark Alerian MLP index was up 4.3 percent, as all but one of the index’s 50 constituents were higher. Alerian traditionally rebalances the index just after needed merger votes are passed, according to firm documents. The index’s constituents have an average size of $8.5 billion. The shares of the next-largest were rallying on Monday. Plains All-American Pipeline LP (PAA.N) gained 2.2 percent and Energy Transfer Partners LP gained 2.6 percent.  “The universe is not that big so $50 billion leaving it, that money is going to want to find a new home in other MLPs,” said Tsachy Mishal, founder and chief investment officer at TAM Capital Management in New York, who owns units of Energy Transfer Partners, which has a 5.7 percent weight in the Alerian index.

Kinder Morgan said on Sunday it would put all its units under one roof. Investors had grown concerned the tax-advantaged Master Limited Partnership (MLP) structure that the Houston-based company popularized was hurting its growth and was too complicated. The companies had a market value of $92 billion before the deal was announced. Under the terms of the deal, it will consolidate its MLPs, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and El Paso Pipeline Partners, with Kinder Morgan Management LLC and organize into a single C-corporation. The proposed deal makes sense for Kinder Morgan because the company had grown so large and was paying out so much of its cash to its general partners that it was hindered in making acquisitions by a higher cost of capital, Kinder said. Those payouts to general partners amounted to about 40 percent of profits, a source familiar with the deal said. “This is no way a swipe at MLPs in general,” Kinder told investors. Investors had penalized Kinder Morgan for having two MLPs that left it undervalued overall, while MLPs have come under increased scrutiny. The U.S. Treasury said on Monday it was looking at the proliferation of MLPs and their impact on tax revenues after the Internal Revenue Service halted approvals earlier this year for new MLPs that depart from the traditional pipeline model. The sector now has more than 100 energy MLPs. On Wall Street, some investors have said the weak corporate governance standards of MLPs expose minority investors to more risks, while others have warned that any rise in U.S. interest rates could make MLPs less attractive. MLPs pay no taxes if they distribute the bulk of their profits to investors. But the structures can become unwieldy. The biggest MLPs face pressure to increase distributions for yield-hungry investors, even as general partners are often entitled to bigger payouts if certain performance thresholds are met. Kinder Chief Financial Officer Kimberly Dang said the transaction will be tax-free for holders of Kinder Morgan Management shares, which is a C-corporation, while investors in the Kinder MLPs will be taxed on capital gains and ordinary income. Investors said the tax setback would be temporary. “This is a taxable transaction, so that may be a short term hit for people,” said Quinn Kiley, of Advisory Research Inc, which manages over $6 billion in MLP companies. “The reality is when you have a big tax payment, it’s because you’ve made a lot of money. It’s a good problem to have.” Greg Reid of asset management firm Salient, which owns Kinder Morgan units, said the company would be able to tap a wider pool of investors as many cannot buy MLPs. “(This) opens up the universe to a lot more institutional buyers,” Reid said. Some other MLPs with lagging growth could follow Kinder’s lead and organize as a single company, but investors said Kinder Morgan’s case was unique and a mass departure from the MLP structure was unlikely. “I really don’t think it’s the start of a trend. The factors that drove this ... (were) specific to Kinder,” said Kevin McCarthy, head of Kayne Anderson, a company that invests in MLPs. One banker mentioned Energy Transfer Partners LP, a fellow midstream company, as a candidate for reorganization. Another banker who asked not to be identified by name mentioned as a potential takeover candidate Targa Resources Partners LP, which said in June that merger talks with Energy Transfer fell through. Neither company was available to comment. The shares of other large-cap MLPs were up across the board, in part because Kinder Morgan’s consolidation means its units will exit two key MLP indexes. That will create space for other MLPs. In morning trading Monday, the benchmark Alerian MLP index was up 4.3 percent, as all but one of the index’s 50 constituents were higher. Alerian traditionally rebalances the index just after needed merger votes are passed, according to firm documents. The index’s constituents have an average size of $8.5 billion. The shares of the next-largest were rallying on Monday. Plains All-American Pipeline LP gained 2.2 percent and Energy Transfer Partners LP gained 2.6 percent. “The universe is not that big so $50 billion leaving it, that money is going to want to find a new home in other MLPs,” said Tsachy Mishal, founder and chief investment officer at TAM Capital Management in New York, who owns units of Energy Transfer Partners, which has a 5.7 percent weight in the Alerian index.

Earlier in the day, NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned of a “high probability” that Russia, using the guise of a humanitarian mission, could intervene militarily in Ukraine.  Ukraine has also said that, contrary to Russian reports of de-escalating, Russia has massed 45,000 troops on its border. Investors did not seem fazed by the reports. The Market Vectors Russia Exchange-Traded Fund, which gives investors exposure to publicly traded companies based in Russia, gained 1.43 percent. “It seems like U.S. investors who are taking a risk on Russian equities don’t deem NATO’s statement as a legitimate concern,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Investors with money in Russian equities seem to be “taking Russia’s actions at face value, and not interpreting it as a cover for military action,” he said. Gains were broad, with eight of the S&P;’s 10 primary sector indexes ending higher for the day. Consumer staples shares posted the highest increases as the sector’s index  gained 0.8 percent, while energy and utilities shares dragged. Stocks also climbed after the United States continued air strikes against Islamic State militants in northern Iraq over the weekend and as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed indirect talks mediated by Egypt on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.05 points, or 0.10 percent, to end at 16,569.98, still below its close at the end of 2013. The S&P; 500 gained 5.33 points, or 0.28 percent, to finish at 1,936.92. The Nasdaq Composite  added 30.43 points, or 0.70 percent, to close at 4,401.33. Shares of Kinder Morgan Inc, the biggest U.S. pipeline company, jumped 9 percent to $39.37. The stock was the S&P; 500’s biggest percentage gainer in Monday’s session after the company said on Sunday that it would put all its publicly traded units under one roof in a $70 billion deal. Kinder Morgan ranked No. 3 among S&P; 500 components in contributing to the benchmark index’s gain for the day, in terms of index points. The shares of the company’s other units - Kinder Morgan Partners, Kinder Morgan Management and El Paso Pipeline Partners - also rallied. The JP Morgan Alerian MLP exchange-traded note, which tracks energy master limited partnerships, rose 3.6 percent. Investors snapped up shares of companies developing potential treatments for the often fatal Ebola virus disease  amid growing calls to expedite research funding and drug approvals. U.S.-listed shares of Canada-based Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp soared 15.0 percent to $23.80. The stock of U.S.-based Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  gained 7.4 percent to $22.66. Priceline Group Inc shares rose 2.2 percent to $1,309.28 after the online travel agency reported quarterly revenue rose 26 percent. More than 2 million shares were traded, almost triple the 50-day moving average volume of 724,115 shares. The stock of Chiquita Brands International Inc  surged 30.2 percent to $13.10 in its biggest one-day advance since its trading debut in 2002. Juice maker Cutrale Group and Brazilian investment firm Safra Group offered to buy Chiquita for $13 per share in cash. About 4.7 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the five-day average of 6.1 billion.

201,KMI,U.S. Treasury looking at increase in master limited partnerships,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department is looking into increased use by companies of the master limited partnership (MLP) as a business structure, a department spokesperson said on Monday, hours after a pioneering user turned its back on the MLP. Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), the biggest U.S. pipeline company, said it will consolidate into a single corporation, folding together its existing organization of several master limited partnerships (MLPs). The Treasury statement, sent in an email, came in answer to questions from Reuters following Kinder Morgan’s news. “We at Treasury are looking into the effects of these transactions on future tax revenues,” the spokesperson said. “Instances where the tax base may be eroded serve as a reminder of why we need Congress to enact business tax reform that broadens the tax base and lowers tax rates.” Kinder Morgan’s investors had grown concerned that the tax-advantaged MLP structure popularized by the company was hurting its growth and was too complicated. Under the terms of its restructuring, it will consolidate its MLPs Kinder Morgan Energy Partners KMP.N and El Paso Pipeline Partners LP EPB.N with Kinder Morgan Management LLC KMR.N and organize into a single C-corporation. The move represented a turning point for the rise of MLPs, which are publicly traded but pay no corporate income tax, unlike C-corporations which are more familiar to investors. MLP status has been limited by the Internal Revenue Service to certain kinds of businesses, including oil and gas companies and real estate investment trusts. But a range of other businesses in recent years have tried to use the MLP structure. The IRS, which answers to the Treasury Department, said in early April that it had temporarily stopped issuing private letter rulings (PLRs) that companies often seek to get the agency’s blessing when setting up new MLPs.  IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told reporters that the agency had imposed a “pause” on the rulings so it could review the qualifications for MLPs. An IRS spokesman said on Monday that the pause remains in place.

205,KMI,Kinder Morgan to fold units into one company in $70 billion deal,"(Reuters) - Top U.S. pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc said on Sunday it will put all its publicly traded units under one roof  in a $70 billion deal, responding to investor concerns about its growth prospects and complicated financial structure. The oil and gas pipeline company said it would shed the tax-advantaged legal structure it had popularized during the U.S. shale boom, the Master Limited Partnership (MLP), and fold its units into one company with a market capitalization of $92 billion organized as a C-corporation. The affected units include Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, Kinder Morgan Management, and El Paso Pipeline Partners. The deal is comprised of $40 billion in Kinder Morgan Inc equity, $4 billion in cash and $27 billion in assumed debt.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rich Kinder had been under pressure from investors and last month on Kinder Morgan Partners’ second-quarter earnings call said combinations of the Kinder companies were being evaluated. A source familiar with the matter said Kinder Morgan’s overall valuation had suffered because it traded as four entities and the market struggled to understand it. The MLP structure also required the units to hand over some 40 percent of their cash to general partners, hurting Kinder Morgan’s ability to make acquisitions that will now be easier to carry out, the source added. At one point, people involved in the transaction considered putting all the units into a single MLP, the source said. But MLPs, which pay no taxes if they distribute the bulk of their earnings to investors, have been coming under greater scrutiny. The Internal Revenue Service this year halted approvals for new MLPs that stray from the traditional pipeline model, some investors have said the weak corporate governance standards of MLPs expose minority investors to added risks, and others have warned their allure among yield-hungry investors could diminish if U.S. interest rates rise.     The company said in a presentation on its website that the new structure would allow for better dividend growth of about 10 percent a year and bigger income tax savings. It expects the deal to close by the end of the year. It forecast a dividend of $2.00 in 2015, a 16 percent increase over the anticipated 2014 dividend of $1.72. “This combined entity will be the largest energy infrastructure company in North America and the third largest energy company overall,” CEO Kinder said in a statement. Kinder, a former Enron Corp executive, formed Kinder Morgan in 1997, growing the company from one with 175 employees to one that now has about 11,000 employees. Worth an estimated $10 billion, according to Forbes, he has pledged much of his fortune to charity. Kinder Morgan is credited with pioneering the use of MLPs that more than 100 capital-intensive companies in the energy sector have adopted, and the company’s deal marks a significant pullback from the structure. Kinder Morgan, the largest midstream company in North America, has an interest in or operates some 80,000 miles of pipelines that move natural gas, refined products, carbon dioxide and crude oil. In a July note to clients, analysts at Houston-based investment bank Tudor, Pickering Holt said the Kinder companies had underperformed for the last two years, held back by a “stubbornly high cost of capital” even though since 2012 about $40 billion in deals were struck that were intended to jump-start growth. An email sent to clients of independent research firm Hedgeye Risk Management last year called Kinder Morgan and its associated companies “a house of cards,” though other analysts disagreed and said the company had strong fundamentals as U.S. output of oil and gas, and demand for infrastructure to move it, surges. Barclays and Citi acted as financial advisors to KMI, Barclays is providing committed financing for the transaction, and Weil Gotshal & Manges and Bracewell & Giuliani acted as legal counsel to KMI, according to the statement.  Jefferies acted as financial advisor to KMP and KMR and Baker Botts acted as legal counsel to KMP and KMR. Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co acted as financial advisor to EPB and Vinson & Elkins acted as legal counsel to EPB.

206,KMI,Kinder Morgan bonds rally on merger news,"NEW YORK, Aug 11 (IFR) - Bonds of oil and gas pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc rallied Monday on expectations that its credit ratings would be boosted to investment-grade following a US$70bn deal to bring all of its publicly traded units into one group. Kinder Morgan’s 5% February 2021 bonds jumped to 107 from 101.5 on Friday, while the 5.625% November 2023 bonds rose to 108.5 from 102.5, according to a trader. Another trader said Kinder Morgan Energy Partners long-dated 7.75% March 2032 bonds jumped 15 points to a cash price of 125.5, while its shares soared by almost 20%. The moves follow an announcement Sunday that Kinder Morgan would shed the tax-advantaged Master Limited Partnership (MLP)legal structure it had popularized during the US shale boom, and fold its units into one company with a market capitalization of US$92bn. The affected units include Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, Kinder Morgan Management, and El Paso Pipeline Partners. CreditSights analysts said the mega merger would send Kinder Morgan Inc’s speculative grade Ba2/BB/BB+ ratings by Moody’s, S&P; and Fitch respectively, into investment-grade territory - probably low BBB and eventually mid-BBB in a year of so. “Leverage will be high but we expect Kinder Morgan Inc has pledged some debt reduction with excess free cash flow in order to get the investment-grade blessing of the agencies,” said CreditSights analysts Andy DeVries and Charles Johnston. Kinder Morgan was taken private by private equity investors including Carlyle Group and Goldman Sachs in a US$22bn leveraged buyout in 2007 - the sixth biggest LBO on record at the time - and made its debut in the stock market in 2011. “We can’t help but point out Kinder Morgan is probably the only US$10+ billion LBO of the 2005-2008 LBO boom where legacy bondholders will now have their pre-deal investment grade ratings restored,” The CreditSights analysts said. The combined entity will have an enterprise value of around US$140bn based on Friday’s closing prices.

All ten primary S&P; 500 sectors were higher on the day, and more than three-fourths of stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were higher on the day. On Friday, major indexes posted their best day since March on news that Russia was ending military drills near the Ukrainian border, a move seen as indicating Russia would not send troops into Ukraine anytime soon. Despite that, NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he saw a “high probability” that Russia could intervene militarily and that NATO detected no sign that Moscow was pulling back thousands of troops from close to the Ukrainian border. Investors also monitored Iraq, where the U.S. recently launched air strikes targeting Islamic State fighters marching on the country’s Kurdish capital, as well as the unrest between Israel and the Palestinians, who agreed to a new 72-hour ceasefire in Gaza. “At least for the time being, the situation in Ukraine appears fairly contained,” said Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares Inc in Raleigh, North Carolina, adding that “despite some of the military unrest, the Iraqi crisis looks to be going on a more limited scope and not having a significant impact on the commodity market.” U.S. crude futures rose 0.7 percent to $98.30 per barrel. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.49 points or 0.41 percent, to 16,621.42, the S&P; 500 gained 12.1 points or 0.63 percent, to 1,943.69 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 42.81 points or 0.98 percent, to 4,413.71. Priceline Group Inc rose 2.6 percent to $1,314.98 after the company reported a 26 percent rise in second-quarter revenue, though it also forecast third-quarter earnings below expectations. Expedia Inc rose 3.9 percent to $85.79. Kinder Morgan Inc on Sunday said it would put all its publicly traded units under one roof in a $70 billion deal, an amount including $27 billion in assumed debt. Shares jumped 8.7 percent to $39.26. Among its units, Kinder Morgan Management  surged 23.5 percent to $95.10 while Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP was up 17 percent to $93.99. MannKind Corp rose 12 percent to $9.09 after French drugmaker Sanofi signed a worldwide licensing agreement with the company worth up to $925 million. Chiquita Brands International Inc climbed 31 percent to $13.21 in its biggest one-day advance since its 2002 trading debut after Juice maker Cutrale Group and Brazilian investment firm Safra Group offered to buy the company. Equities were also boosted as Vice Fed Chair Stanley Fischer said the recoveries in the U.S. and global economies had been “disappointing” thus far, indicating the Fed may not imminently tighten its monetary policy. “It appears Fischer believes accommodative monetary policy can help keep cyclical slowdown factors from turning structural, which is dovish in the short run but argues for a potentially higher neutral rate than otherwise in the longer run,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note to clients.

At the time, he recommended shorting Kinder Morgan Energy Partners in a report that claimed the company skimped on maintenance work to boost cash distributed to investors in its MLPs, an assertation the company disputed. Now, in a new report obtained by Reuters, Kaiser is recommending investors short Kinder Morgan Inc, which will be the remaining entity after it buys out its two MLPs El Paso Pipeline Partners LP EPB.N and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP KMP.N and Kinder Morgan Management LLC KMR.N for cash and stock.  He argues the combined company will be overvalued and have too much debt. Kinder Morgan Inc’s shares traded on Tuesday at $38.50. “With (pro forma) Kinder Morgan prices at a valuation comparable to Facebook’s FB.N, the risk from here is to the downside,” Kaiser wrote. “The valuation risk is substantial and is exacerbated by the higher leverage. But anyone who was short Kinder Morgan Energy Partners would have had a very bad day on Monday when units rose 17 percent to close at $94.12. One MLP investor characterized short sellers as the biggest losers in the deal. “Nothing happened yesterday,” Kaiser said in an interview. There was no value created. All they did was move around some deck chairs.” Kaiser, who is an active social media user, took a beating on Twitter on Monday and was even singled out by CNBC financial personality Jim Cramer in a column on the Street.com.     Still, analysts at Moody’s plan to give the combined company an investment grade rating characterized as “weak” due to a high debt level and planned high dividend payout ratio.  Moody’s calculates that Kinder Morgan as a consolidated company will have a net debt-to-earnings ratio of 6 times before EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), leaving it “more leveraged than all of its peers,” the rating agency said in a note on Monday.    Kinder Morgan declined to specifically comment on Kaiser’s assertions. But on a conference call with analysts on Monday, Chief Executive Officer Rich Kinder said the deal would add “immediate and significant value uplift” to its investors. Kinder also said its debt to EBITDA ratio would move lower over time.

210,KMI,Carlyle taps banks for former DuPont unit IPO -sources,"NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Buyout firm Carlyle Group LP  has hired banks for an initial public offering of Axalta Coating Systems LLC, according to people familiar with the matter, just a year and a half after it acquired the company from Dupont for $4.9 billion. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc have been given leading roles in the potential IPO of the performance coatings company, the people said on Wednesday. The IPO could raise as much as $1 billion, one of the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Bloomberg News reported on Axalta’s IPO preparations earlier on Wednesday. Carlyle, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while an Axalta spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Based in Philadelphia, Axalta makes liquid and powder coatings for the automotive and general transportation industries. It operates 35 manufacturing centers and does business in more than 130 countries, according to its website. Private equity firms typically hold on to companies between three and five years before they sell them. Carlyle’s plans to take Axalta public in such a short time frame reflect the strength of the equity markets as well the private equity firm’s confidence in Axalta’s prospects as a public company. These plans, however, may not necessarily lead to a quick exit for Carlyle. For example, it took the Washington, D.C.-based firm more than six years for it to sell its shares in Hertz Global Holdings Inc. Carlyle took Hertz public in November 2006, just seven months after it acquired the company together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC and Merrill Lynch Private Equity in a $15 billion deal. Other private equity firms have also rushed to take some of their biggest portfolio companies public. Apollo Global Management LLC floated oil and gas producer EP Energy Corp in the stock market in January, just eight months after acquiring it from Kinder Morgan Inc for $7.15 billion.

211,KMI,California judge throws out lawsuit targeting crude by rail facility,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A San Francisco Superior Court judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit brought by environmental groups against Kinder Morgan’s Richmond, California, rail terminal, which quietly began unloading crude oil from trains this year, saying the plaintiffs waited too long to file their complaint.  The groups argued that since the company was given permission from regulators to begin accepting the deliveries without public notice, they were not immediately aware of the change.  Judge Peter Busch acknowledged there were “deep concerns” about the new cargo, which passes through the densely populated city of Richmond, but said the plaintiffs missed the 180-day window to request that the permit be revoked.  Suma Peesapati, an attorney for the environmental groups that brought the suit, said the company and regulators knowingly deceived the public. “This is just how the agencies and industry win – hide the information, make the change under the cover of night, and hope people don’t notice while the clock winds down on any hope to stop these dangerous and callous developments,” she said.  Kinder Morgan and the regulator, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, said they followed the law as written and denied doing anything in secret. California law does not require public notification or an environmental review for the permit, which was issued in February.  Friday’s ruling was met with hisses from environmentalists who attended the hearing, some of whom participated in a protest the previous day where they chained themselves to a fence at the facility.  The Kinder Morgan terminal is the most substantial oil-by-rail facility in the state, handling up to 72,000 barrels per day. The crude is unloaded from incoming trains and placed on trucks bound for a Tesoro-owned refinery in Martinez.  The number of trains ferrying crude oil by rail to California from Canada and North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation has jumped dramatically in recent years, prompting safety and environmental concerns.  In July 2013, a train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in a town in the Canadian province of Quebec, killing 47 people.

213,KMI,British Columbia court rejects bid to block Kinder Morgan pipeline,"VANCOUVER, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The Supreme Court of British Columbia has rejected a local municipality’s bid for a temporary injunction to stop survey work for an oil pipeline expansion project proposed by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners. Justice Brenda Brown issued her decision on Wednesday, but her written reasons will not be released until next week. Burnaby mayor Derek Corrigan said he was “disappointed and frustrated” by the court’s decision but said the municipality will continue to push for a permanent injunction. “We are considering whether or not we want to appeal the interim injunction denial,” he said. “We won’t know that until we see the reasons sometime next week.” The court case is the latest in a long-running battle between the City of Burnaby, part of Metro Vancouver, and Kinder Morgan over the Texas-based company’s plans to nearly triple the capacity of its Trans Mountain crude pipeline to 890,000 barrels per day. The company wants to twin the pipeline, which was built in 1953 and runs from the oil sand hub of Edmonton to its marine terminal in Burnaby. But the city, which has grown into a major urban center over the last 60 years, is opposed to the plan. While much of the new line would run along the existing right-of-way, the company has changed its preferred route through Burnaby and now wants to run a key segment under Burnaby Mountain, a local conservation site. City officials and crews hired by Kinder Morgan clashed last week over whether the company was allowed to cut down a handful of trees on the mountain to do survey work for the new route. The company said it had been granted permission to carry out the work by Canada’s energy regulator, the National Energy Board (NEB), while the city argued it was against municipal law and blocked access to the site. Burnaby then asked the court for an injunction to block any work that would disrupt parkland. The pipeline company responded by asking the NEB to prevent the city from stopping its crews. The Trans Mountain expansion is supported by Canada’s oil producers, who are eager to sidestep the over-supplied U.S. Midwest, where Canadian crudes sell at a discount to benchmark prices, and tap directly into foreign markets. But the project is facing growing opposition from communities throughout Metro Vancouver, who worry about the risks that come with more oil being stored in tanks in Burnaby and more tanker ship traffic on Pacific Coast waters. Kinder Morgan has said it needs access to the mountain to complete environmental and geotechnical studies that it must submit to the NEB before a Dec. 1 deadline. The regulator has already pushed back its decision on the project by about six months to January 2016.

214,KMI,Kinder Morgan builds out Gulf Coast logistics hub in U.S. oil boom,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - To capitalize on a flood of domestic and Canadian crude into the U.S. Gulf Coast, logistics giant Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is spending more than $1.5 billion in Houston to build the most flexible oil and fuel transport hub in the country. The company’s expanding infrastructure smorgasbord includes a bit of almost everything at the increasingly crowded Houston Ship Channel –  all next door to the biggest concentration of refiners in the country. The buildout, executives say, responds to the increasingly dynamic world of physical crude trading in North America, where the variety of available crudes is growing, and is aimed at securing their central position in moving oil from the U.S. shale boom to market.  Customers want multiple options to switch delivery modes on a dime and snag the best price for refinery feedstocks. They need more dock and storage space to handle surging volumes of fuel being shipped overseas. “More of them are producing more than they can consume in the United States. So they want to take it to water, either for movement up and down the coast ... or to export because you see a tremendous amount of growth,” John Schlosser, president of Kinder Morgan’s terminal division, said of refiners. Schlosser, who spoke to Reuters on a tour of the company’s facilities, said the company was doubling down on its core business. “Our bread and butter is the midstream - that’s where we’re making all of our investments,” he said. “It’s like connecting the dots.” Kinder’s latest push is to add storage and pipeline connections to final domestic destinations, a huge oil-by-rail offloading operation, and a wider export platform. The company recently acquired U.S.-flagged tankers that can move crude and products between domestic ports as required under the Jones Act. Docking space it added opens customer opportunities to export refined products and coal internationally. “It gives us the opportunity to touch customers in an additional way beyond just the terminal or the pipeline footprint,” Schlosser said. Kinder’s spending in Houston is a piece of hundreds of millions of dollars in pipeline, storage, distribution and ship berthing investments being made across the Gulf Coast in the oil and chemicals industries. Those include Enterprise Products Partners’ and Enbridge Inc’s $2 billion expansion of the Seaway Oklahoma-to-Texas crude oil pipeline, Oiltanking Partners LP’s $340 million oil storage expansion in Beaumont and Magellan Midstream Partners’ $1 billion BridgeTex pipeline joint venture with Occidental Petroleum Corp. “It’s about creating a nimble and adaptable infrastructure. When everything is in flux and in constant change you have to have the ability to be flexible, to adapt to new streams and to new requirements,” Javier del Olmo, Oiltanking’s vice president of engineering, recently told analysts. Enterprise also is expanding its Enterprise Crude Oil Houston (ECHO) storage and distribution complex in south Houston with connections to southeast Texas refineries that provide a fifth of U.S. refining capacity. Brent Secrest, vice president of onshore crude oil pipelines and terminals for Enterprise, said the key is the so-called “last mile” - getting incoming crude to its final stop. “Ultimately the barrels are going to have to clear the market, and (Enterprise’s) vision is to build the most comprehensive distribution system on the Gulf Coast,” he said. U.S. crude production averaged 8.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, up 72 percent from 2008, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Energy consultancy Turner Mason & Company projects that U.S. output will reach about 12 million bpd early in the next decade. “The impetus is on us to find places to put it,” Enterprise’s Secrest said. Kinder is widening its crude handling, with a major 300,000- bpd crude and condensate pipeline stretching from the Eagle Ford shale to Houston, as well as a 210,000-bpd oil-by-rail joint venture with privately held short-line railroad operator Watco Companies that started up this summer. Some of that condensate, a very light form of crude oil that makes up about half of the Eagle Ford’s output, will feed a 50,000-bpd condensate splitter Kinder aims to start up in November and a second one next year to double that output. Splitters perform more complicated processes than oilfield condensate stabilizers that remove natural gas liquids from crude, but are more simple than a refinery. It “splits” condensate into naphtha, a element of gasoline, diesel, jet fuels and other petroleum components that BP Plc will buy and then sell. Kinder is also adding docks and pipelines to its two major complexes in Galena Park and Pasadena along the ship channel, including a coal and petroleum coke export facility. And this year’s $962 million acquisition of American Petroleum Tankers and State Class Tankers brought U.S.-flagged oil shipping in house, another option requested by customers. “The reality is, (customers) don’t know where their markets are going to be tomorrow, or 10 years from now, or even two years from now,” Schlosser said. “They want to know that they can go to A, B, C, D or E, depending on what makes the most sense.” ",9192014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kinder-morgn-eng-houston/kinder-morgan-builds-out-gulf-coast-logistics-hub-in-u-s-oil-boom-idUSKBN0HE22W20140919

216,KMI,CORRECTED-Kinder Morgan to add oil storage capacity to Houston operations,"(Corrects the cost of the project in the second paragraph to $240 million from $210 million) By Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. said it will add 2.1 million barrels of storage at its Pasadena and Galena Park terminals just outside Houston. The $240 million project - supported by long-term contracts with existing customers - will also include the construction of a new ship dock and other improvements at the Galena Park terminal that will boost vessel load rates. The new dock and the existing ones at Galena Park will be capable of loading vessels at rates up to 15,000 barrels per hour, the company said. “The new tankage will provide refined product producers and traders the ability to send more barrels to the water for international exports or to the network of pipelines for domestic use,” John Schlosser, president of Kinder Morgan Terminals, said in a company release announcing the project. The company will now have nine ship docks on the Houston Ship Channel and will double the load rates on existing docks. “We see continuing strong demand for transporting fuel to the Gulf Coast to reach export markets,” Schlosser said.

220,KMI,Canada regulator says Kinder Morgan wins battle with B.C. suburb,"CALGARY, Alberta, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Canada’s energy regulator ruled on Thursday that Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP must be allowed access to a park in a Vancouver suburb in order to complete technical work for the planned C$5.4 billion($4.81 billion) expansion of its Trans Mountain oil pipeline. In its first order on record to a Canadian municipality, the National Energy Board said the City of Burnaby must allow the company to carry out surveys and studies at Burnaby Mountain, a  conservation site. Burnaby sought to block the company’s access to the site after city officials and crews hired by Kinder Morgan clashed last month over whether the company was allowed to cut down a handful of trees on the mountain to do survey work for the new route, work Kinder Morgan said the National Energy Board had approved. Following a hearing earlier this month, the board agreed it could trump local by-laws and ordered the city to stand down. “Surveys and studies about Trans Mountain’s proposed pipeline route through Burnaby Mountain are required in order to make a recommendation to the federal government about whether or not this project should proceed,” the board said in a release. “Preventing full access to Burnaby Mountain would be contrary to the purpose of the NEB Act.” The planned expansion of the line, which takes crude oil from Edmonton, Alberta, to Vancouver, will nearly triple its capacity to 890,000 barrels per day.

But many area residents oppose plans to run the line under the mountain, and protesters had blocked crews drilling two bore holes for preliminary work on a planned tunnel. The injunction is Kinder’s latest win against the project’s opponents. The city of Burnaby sought to block work on the site after crews cut down trees, but lost before both a court and the national energy regulator. The project is also opposed by many environmental and aboriginal groups, as well as by the mayors of Burnaby and Vancouver.

222,KMI,Canadian police arrest protesters at Kinder Morgan work site,"VANCOUVER, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Canadian police said on Thursday they arrested environmental protesters who have been blocking work at two Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP  sites in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, three days after a court injunction for their removal came into effect. Kinder Morgan, which hopes to triple the size of its 300,000-barrel-per-day Trans Mountain pipeline, plans to bore two holes deep into Burnaby Mountain to test if it will be possible to run the expanded pipeline under the conservation site, which is a popular hiking and picnic area for locals. Staff Sergeant Major John Buis, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told Reuters that the protesters camped out at the sites were removed Thursday morning. “There were about a dozen people in the camps when we went up there,” he said. “I don’t know if all of them have been arrested, it was a very fluid situation.” Some of the protesters may have moved over to a nearby third camp, which is not covered under the injunction, rather than be arrested, Buis added. Protesters, who call themselves caretakers of the site,  said in a statement that least 12 people were arrested. Houston-based Kinder Morgan was granted an injunction late last week to clear the protest camps and resume surveying work on the C$5.4 billion ($4.8 billion) expansion project. The court order was enforceable as of Monday. Many area residents are opposed to the pipeline plan, which would allow the company to ship more tar sands crude from Alberta to the port of Vancouver and on to Asian markets. Protesters for weeks had blocked crews from working on the mountain. The Trans Mountain project is also opposed by many environmental and aboriginal groups, as well as by the mayors of Burnaby and Vancouver. The injunction is Kinder Morgan’s latest win against its opponents. The city of Burnaby sought to block work on the site after crews cut down trees, but lost before both a court and the national energy regulator. It was not clear when the company would be able to resume work at the two sites, as the protesters’ tents and other belongings have not yet been removed.

223,KMI,Kinder Morgan resumes work on Canadian pipeline expansion,"VANCOUVER, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  said on Friday that crews have resumed survey work related to its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, even as Canadian police arrested more protesters at two work sites. Kinder Morgan said it was able to move its equipment onto Burnaby Mountain overnight and that crews would be working 24 hours a day for the next 10 to 12 days to complete drilling work required by regulators. The company, which hopes to nearly triple the capacity of the existing 300,000 barrel-per-day pipeline, plans to bore two holes deep into the mountain to test if it can run the expanded line under the conservation site, which is a popular hiking and picnic area for locals. Environmentalists, aboriginal groups and many area residents are opposed to the expansion, which would allow the company to ship more tar sands crude from Alberta to a port in Vancouver and on to Asian markets. A group of protesters, who call themselves the caretakers of the mountain, had for weeks been occupying the more remote of the two work sites. On Thursday, Canadian police began enforcing a court order for their removal, arresting 26 people. On Friday, eight more people were arrested, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said in a statement, while three aboriginal protesters remain inside the injunction zone. Police are in talks to move them to a legal protest area nearby. Kinder Morgan, meanwhile, said it was setting up fencing and lights in preparation for starting drilling work. The company’s proposal to expand the 60-year-old Trans Mountain pipeline is being reviewed by Canadian regulators, with a decision expected in early 2016.

Kinder Morgan, which wrapped up drilling work at one of two sites on Burnaby mountain earlier on Thursday, said it will amend its work plan to ensure the second site is also cleared before the current injunction runs out on Dec. 1. It had asked for an extension to Dec. 12.

226,KMI,Kinder Morgan considering exporting condensate: Genscape,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc might export condensate as part of a resurrected plan to move Texas crude to Southern California via a converted natural gas pipeline, energy intelligence firm Genscape Inc reported in a blog post on Thursday. The pipeline and storage company is in talks with potential shippers for its Freedom Pipeline project, Genscape said, citing Tom Dobson, project director of Kinder Morgan Pipelines. It would be the first major crude pipeline from Texas into California, giving the Golden State access to cheaper inland crudes and cut dependence on more costly imports.  “We have always said that we will continue to look at this project and will build it if we get sufficient customer interest,” Kinder spokesman Richard Wheatley said in an email on Thursday. “This was discussion only, not a formal project announcement.” The company shelved the $2 billion project in mid-2013 because of lack of interest, but revived it with an added proposal to export processed condensate from third-party California docks, Dobson told Genscape at an energy conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday.   The line, as discussed, would move 100,000 bpd of condensate and 200,000 bpd of blended crude from far West Texas to Emido, California, near Los Angeles-area refineries, Dobson said. At least three companies - not including Kinder Morgan - are known to have received U.S. government approvals since September 2013 to export condensate, a very light form of crude. The rulings said condensate processed enough to qualify as a refined product could be exported without violating the decades-old U.S. crude export ban. Light processing provided by stabilizers, which removes natural gas liquids, and other more sophisticated distillation units meet that threshold. A fourth company, BHP Billiton Ltd, said it is moving forward with condensate exports without waiting for a ruling because the company is confident its minimal processing is satisfactory. Wheatley had no immediate comment on whether Kinder Morgan is seeking a ruling. Kinder Morgan’s plan, if approved, would include a new 150,000 bpd atmospheric topping unit that could produce processed condensate, as well as gasoil and residual fuel to blend with crude, Dobson said. Export-bound condensate could then be shipped in batches separate from other crude blended to satisfy the requirements of California refineries built to run heavier oil, Dobson said.

228,KMI,"REFILE-RPT-As oil plummets, how much pain still looms for US energy firms?","(Corrects Kinder Morgan instrument code in paragraph 24) By Edward McAllister and David Randall NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - With nearly a quarter of U.S. energy shares’ value wiped out by oil’s six-month slide, investors are wondering if the sector has taken enough punishment and whether it is time to pile back in ahead of earnings reports later this month. The broad energy S&P; 1500 index gained more than 4 percent over the past month, suggesting many believe markets have already factored in the pain caused by oil prices tumbling by more than half since June below $50 a barrel. Yet since the start of this year, most energy stocks have given up some of those gains, revealing anxiety that some nasty surprises might still be lurking somewhere and that last month’s bounce may not last. A closer look at valuations and interviews with a dozen of smaller firms ahead of fourth quarter results from their bigger, listed rivals, shows there are reasons to be nervous. What small firms say is that the oil rout hit home faster and harder than most had expected. “Things have changed a lot quicker than I thought they would,” says Greg Doramus, sales manager at Orion Drilling in Corpus Christi, Texas, a small firm which leases 16 drilling rigs. He talks about falling rates, last-minute order cancellations and customers breaking leases. The conventional wisdom is that hedging and long-term contracts would ensure that most energy firms would only start feeling the full force of the downdraft this year. The view from the oil fields from Texas to North Dakota is that the pain is already spreading. “We have been cut from the work,” says Adam Marriott, president of Fandango Logistics, a small oil trucking firm in Salt Lake City. He says shipments have fallen by half since June when oil was fetching more than $100 a barrel and his company had all the business it could handle. Bigger firms are also feeling the sting. Last week, a leading U.S. drilling contractor Helmerich & Payne reported that leasing rates for its high-tech rigs plunged 10 percent from the previous quarter, sending its shares 5 percent lower. The apparent disconnect between energy stocks’ recent recovery and the furious cuts in Wall Street’s earning estimates could also be a sign that the sector’s 24 percent plunge since June may not fully reflect how ugly it can still get. Thomson Reuters data shows Wall Street brokerages slashed their fourth quarter estimates for energy firms by over 7 percent in the past 30 days. They now predict earnings of S&P; 500 energy firms to fall 20.7 percent in the fourth quarter and by 36.1 percent this quarter. The price-to-earnings ratio based on estimates for the next  12 months for S&P; 500 energy stocks is around 17, more than 16.3 for the whole S&P; 500 index and above the sector’s 12.5 figure based on reported results, according to Thomson Reuters data. This suggests that either investors bet on a rebound in oil analysts do not see or they risk getting disappointed when the results come out. Yet several stocks have rallied in the past month. One striking example is Penn Virginia Corp, an exploration and production company, which soared by nearly 30 percent even as analysts cut their estimates by more than a third. Short interest of nearly 30 percent suggests the rally might be in part fueled by a “short squeeze” when sellers are forced to buy back the stock when it starts rising to cut their losses. Some analysts say though, many stocks have been sold off enough to offer good value. “If you have no exposure this is a good time to step in,” Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors said at the start of this year. Analysts who advocate buying energy stocks recommend big, high-dividend paying companies, such as Exxon Mobil or Chevron. Both stocks have outperformed the sector during the six-month rout in which companies, such as Chesapeake Energy  or Halliburton lost a third or more of their value. Smaller firms are considered more risky, among them oilfield service companies exposed to spending cuts by exploration and production companies. Analysts expect this year’s budgets to fall by a quarter, but many firms have yet to finalize plans. Investors got a taste how bets on “the worst might be over” scenario could go bad last month when Civeo Corp, a provider of temporary housing for the oil industry, issued a profit warning. The stock has struggled since oil headed south, but investors were still shocked how hard the company got hit, sending its shares crashing by more than 50 percent in one day. For sure, not all energy firms are equal. Civeo represents scores of companies whose fortunes are tied to the shale oil boom that made the United States the world’s top producer, but also helped create a global supply glut that sent prices tumbling. In such a market, the safest bets are pipeline companies like Kinder Morgan Inc, whose shares have risen more than 16 percent in the last six months. Their business depends on traffic volumes, much like toll roads, and the U.S. government still forecasts production to rise this year. Independent refiners and integrated oil majors such as Exxon Mobil that combine exploration with production, refining and distribution, are also expected to brave the storm fairly well. Industry experts say larger, efficient and financially sound producers and services firms may also emerge as winners: taking over weaker rivals or gaining market share. “Good companies with bad balance sheets with productive properties, those are going to be targets,” said Mark Chesen, a managing director of SSW Capital Advisors, a Pennsylvania-based investment bank that specializes in distressed mid-cap firms. But while hedge funds, buy-out firm, private equity and distressed debt investors gear up for 2015 as a year of energy deals, Chesen said they were likely to wait first for signs of oil prices stabilizing. “Until bottoming out I don’t think institutional hedge funds will be interested,” he said. “People need to see three to six months of stability, a minimum of three months.”        (Reporting by David Randall, Edward McAllister, Terry Wade, Anna Driver, David Gaffen, Tom Hals, Nick Brown Writing by David Randall, Edward McAllister and Tomasz Janowski.; Editing by John Pickering)",1122015,http://www.reuters.com/article/oil-plunge-earnings/refile-rpt-as-oil-plummets-how-much-pain-still-looms-for-us-energy-firms-idUSL1N0UR06F20150112

230,KMI,Kinder Morgan to buy Hiland Partners for $3 billion,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Leading pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) will buy Hiland Partners, a pipeline and logistics company founded by Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N) Chief Executive Officer Harold Hamm, for $3 billion, the company said on Wednesday. Hiland Partners builds and operates oil gathering and transportation pipelines and natural gas gathering and processing systems primarily in the Bakken shale oilfields in North Dakota and Montana. Hiland’s customers include Continental and Hess Corp (HES.N). The deal, slated to close during the first quarter of this year, will give Kinder Morgan a premier position in pipelines and logistics in the Bakken, the company said. The $3 billion includes assumption of debt at a time when falling oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 have pressured oil producers such as Continental. Hiland’s assets include the new Double H 84,000 barrels-per-day pipeline that will move Bakken crude from North Dakota to Tallgrass Energy Partners’ TEP.N Pony Express pipeline in Wyoming. From there, Bakken flows will move to the U.S. crude futures hub in Cushing, Oklahoma via the Pony Express. The pipeline is expected to start up by the end of January. Kinder Morgan added that the first phase of its $382 million condensate processing facility near the Houston Ship Channel, which would run the very light crude oil through a splitter so it can be exported as refined products, should begin service in March. The company said “earnings versus our budget” were impacted by delays for the facility. It said the second phase of the condensate processing plant would be operational this summer.

He will be replaced by President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Kean, who has been groomed to take the top job. Kinder will become executive chairman when Kean takes over on June 1. “I want also assure you I have never sold a share of my KMI stock and I don’t intend to do so in the future,” Kinder told investors on a conference call. “As we say in Texas, I plan to die with my boots on.” Kinder, seen as an energy visionary turning the small unit he bought from failed trader Enron in 1997 to a juggernaut, said he was not going anywhere and would be involved in all major decisions involving the company he helped found.

Last year, Kinder presided over an unusual $44 billion deal that folded the company’s master limited partnerships (MLPs) under one publicly traded corporation, Kinder Morgan Inc. It now has a market capitalization of $89 billion. With that deal that closed in November, the Houston company shed its tax-advantaged MLP status as part of an effort to simplify its structure and jumpstart growth prospects.

234,KMI,UPDATE 1-Kinder Morgan to buy Hiland Partners for $3 billion,"(Adds details on condensate processing, quarterly results) By Kristen Hays HOUSTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Leading pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc will buy Hiland Partners, a pipeline and logistics company founded by Continental Resources Inc  Chief Executive Officer Harold Hamm, for $3 billion, the company said on Wednesday. Hiland Partners builds and operates oil gathering and transportation pipelines and natural gas gathering and processing systems primarily in the Bakken shale oilfields in North Dakota and Montana. Hiland’s customers include Continental and Hess Corp. The deal, slated to close during the first quarter of this year, will give Kinder Morgan a premier position in pipelines and logistics in the Bakken, the company said. The $3 billion includes assumption of debt at a time when falling oil prices   have pressured oil producers such as Continental. Hiland’s assets include the new Double H 84,000 barrels-per-day pipeline that will move Bakken crude from North Dakota to Tallgrass Energy Partners’ Pony Express pipeline in Wyoming. From there, Bakken flows will move to the U.S. crude futures hub in Cushing, Oklahoma via the Pony Express. The pipeline is expected to start up by the end of January. Kinder Morgan added that the first phase of its $382 million condensate processing facility near the Houston Ship Channel, which would run the very light crude oil through a splitter so it can be exported as refined products, should begin service in March. The company said “earnings versus our budget” were impacted by delays for the facility. It said the second phase of the condensate processing plant would be operational this summer.

237,KMI,Breakingviews: Oil billionaire pumps Kinder Morgan for tidy gain,"CHICAGO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Leave it to Harold Hamm to pump Kinder Morgan for a tidy gain. The Continental Resources boss is selling Hiland Partners, his private pipeline company, to its giant rival for $3 billion, more than enough to cover his nearly $1 billion divorce bill. The sale also eliminates a conflict of interest that arose from a 2013 deal between Hiland and Continental. Kinder Morgan, meanwhile, gets a prized - if pricey - foothold in North Dakota’s Bakken shale. The transaction comes a little more than two months after a court slapped the oil magnate with one of the biggest divorce tabs in U.S. history. Hamm cut a check for most of the amount earlier this month. He recently took out a personal loan, though, backed by about a quarter of his roughly $10.4 billion stake in Continental. Selling Hiland also probably seals the end of a nettlesome spat with a group of minority Continental shareholders. They sued Hamm in 2013 after Continental invested $100 million in a Hiland pipeline project, alleging that the billionaire had benefited himself at other shareholders’ expense. Continental maintained that the investment was proper, and an Oklahoma court dismissed the suit last August. Kinder Morgan, meanwhile, looks to be paying a healthy price to include in its sprawling web of oil connections one of North America’s most valuable shale regions. The $89 billion pipeline operator disclosed few financial details of the acquisition, saying only that the $3 billion tab should amount to about 10 times Hiland’s expected 2018 EBITDA. That’s less than the nearly 17 times forward enterprise multiple on which Kinder currently trades. But the absence of any pre-2018 estimates suggests the company is shelling out a chunky multiple of next year’s expected cash flow for the business, and it’s an especially tumultuous time for energy markets. The comparatively steady nature of the oil pipeline industry means the acquisition should pay off eventually. That said, there’s not much doubt that Hamm has netted himself a pretty sweet deal. - Pipeline operator Kinder Morgan on Jan. 21 announced that it had agreed to pay $3 billion, including debt, for Hiland Partners, a privately held company controlled by Continental Resources Chief Executive Harold Hamm. - A group of Continental’s minority shareholders sued Hamm in 2013 after Continental invested nearly $100 million in a pipeline being built by Hiland. The shareholders alleged that the investment benefited Hamm at other stockholders’ expense. Continental said the lawsuit had no merit. - Hamm in November was ordered to pay $995 million to his ex-wife in one of the biggest divorce judgments in U.S. history. Continental said in a regulatory filing on Jan. 13 that Hamm had pledged about one-quarter of his shares in the company - currently worth about $2.8 billion - as collateral for a personal loan. - Kinder Morgan announcement: bit.ly/1JlyO2C   (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Kinder Morgan also said the startup of the first phase of its $382 million condensate processing facility at the Houston Ship Channel, which would turn ultra-light crude oil into refined products, has been delayed to March from this month because of vendor delays and bad weather.

Hiland’s assets include the new Double H 84,000 barrels-per-day pipeline that will move Bakken crude from North Dakota to Tallgrass Energy Partners’ Pony Express pipeline in Wyoming. From there, Bakken flows will move to the U.S. crude futures hub in Cushing, Oklahoma via the Pony Express. The pipeline is expected to start up by the end of January and expand to 108,000 bpd in a year. Kinder Morgan also said the startup of the first phase of its $382 million condensate processing facility at the Houston Ship Channel, which would turn ultra-light crude oil into refined products, has been delayed to March from this month because of vendor delays and bad weather. The startup has been delayed twice before, also on vendor delays. The second phase remains on schedule for startup this summer.

241,KMI,Energy Transfer Partners to buy Regency unit for $11 billion,"(Reuters) - Pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP.N) said on Monday it would buy affiliate Regency Energy Partners LP RGP.N for about $11 billion, the latest example of master limited partnerships (MLP) trying to simplify their structures and lift returns. The deal, essentially an in-house merger, is similar to one carried out by pipeline operator Williams Cos. for its Access Midstream Partners unit in October. Unlike the $44 billion deal industry leader Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) led last year to fold all of its units into a traditional C-Corporation, Energy Transfer will remain an MLP with several units. MLP mergers are often held when a unit in a group is underperforming its peers, or to scale back incentivized distribution rights that can divert more cash returns to general partners. Under terms of the deal, Regency shareholders will receive 0.4066 of an Energy Transfer unit and 32 cents in cash for each unit they own. The offer works out to $26.89 per Regency unit based on Energy Transfer’s Friday close, a 13 percent premium to Regency’s last closing price.   Regency shares were up 7.7 percent in early trading, Energy Transfer shares were down 5.5 percent at $61.71. Energy Transfer and Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) own a combined stake of about 22 percent in Regency, according to Thomson Reuters data. Energy Transfer Equity owns the general partner and incentive distribution rights of both Regency and Energy Transfer Partners. Energy Transfer Partners Chief Executive Kelcy Warren is also the chairman of Energy Transfer Equity. MLPs, which pay no taxes if they distribute the bulk of their earnings to investors, are required to hand over a chunk of their cash to general partners. Energy Transfer Equity agreed to reduce the incentive distributions it gets from Energy Transfer by $320 million over five years. The deal also includes the assumption of $6.8 billion in net debt.  A 60 percent fall in crude prices is spurring consolidation in the energy industry. “In light of the current volatility in commodity prices and the changes in the capital markets, it became apparent over the last several months that Regency needed more scale and diversification,” Regency’s Chief Executive Mike Bradley said in a statement.   The deal will help Energy Transfer expand capacity in Texas and add assets in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale field and Ohio’s Utica shale after the deal closes in the second quarter.

243,KMI,Kinder Morgan says Freedom Pipeline project is gaining refiner interest,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc’s (KMI.N) proposed Freedom Pipeline, which would move West Texas crude oil to Southern California, is “getting more interest” from U.S. West Coast refiners, the head of the company’s natural gas pipeline unit told analysts on Wednesday. Unit President Tom Martin said the company “may have a shot” at moving ahead with converting a natural gas pipeline to move crude and condensate to California “if we can get the refiners on board.” The pipeline and logistics company first proposed the $2 billion project in 2012 but shelved it in May 2013 for lack of shipper interest. Martin said on Wednesday that the revamped proposal included adding a facility at the front end in Texas to provide crude blends that better match the Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude that California refineries typically process. The new proposal also involves shipping ultra-light crude, known as condensate, that could be exported from California, he said during the company’s annual analyst meeting. Martin did not say whether Kinder Morgan has or is awaiting U.S. government approval to export condensate with enough processing to qualify as an exportable refined product. At least four other companies have received such approvals, and a fifth is moving ahead with exports without a ruling, satisfied that its minimal processing is sufficient. If approved, the Freedom Pipeline project would open another outlet for processed condensate exports that so far have been shipped from the U.S. Gulf Coast. In 2013, Kinder Morgan said the project could be revived if shipper interest warranted. Martin said the original proposal to convert the 740-mile (1,190-km) line to move crude and build more than 200 miles (320 km) of new pipe would have moved West Texas oil that did not match the types that West Coast refiners want. The new proposal includes a topping unit in Wink, Texas, that would produce processed condensate as well as gasoils and residual fuels to create ANS-like crude blends.  “It seems to be getting more interest from the refiners in the West,” Martin said.

245,KMI,Kinder Morgan commissioning condensate splitter after months of delays,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc is commissioning the first of two condensate splitters at its Houston Ship Channel complex after months of delays, the company said on Tuesday. “We are currently commissioning as planned on our splitter and expect to be at capacity later this month,” Kinder spokeswoman Melissa Ruiz said. The first of two 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) splitters was originally targeted to start up last summer, but a manufacturer’s delay in delivering a major component pushed commissioning to late 2014. But then bad weather and more vendor delays further set back startup until this month. The second 50,000 bpd splitter remains on target to start up in July. A splitter is a step up from oilfield stabilizers, which remove natural gas liquids from crude and condensate, and oil refineries. It “splits” condensate, a very light form of crude oil, into various components such as jet fuel, diesel and naphtha, a building block for gasoline. BP Plc has a 10-year deal with Kinder Morgan to buy all the output from both splitters to sell domestically or internationally. BP has also exported at least one cargo of lightly processed condensate from the Eagle Ford shale in Texas that had not been run through a splitter from the Houston Ship Channel. U.S. government regulators have given approvals to several companies to export stabilized condensate, saying it qualifies as an exportable refined product. Previously the industry believed condensate needed more sophisticated processing in a splitter or a refinery before the output could be exported without violating the decades-old U.S. crude export ban.

246,KMI,"UPDATE 1-Keyera, Kinder Morgan to build 4.8 mln bbls of Alberta crude storage","(Adds quotes from Keyera CEO) By Nia Williams CALGARY, Alberta, March 31 (Reuters) - Canada’s Keyera Corp  and midstream company Kinder Morgan Inc plan to build 4.8 million barrels of new crude oil storage in the marketing hub of Edmonton, Alberta, the two companies said on Tuesday. Capacity at the new terminal has potential to increase to 6.6 million barrels, depending on future demand. The terminal will be a 50-50 joint venture with Keyera’s share of costs expected to be C$330 million ($260.36 million), while Kinder Morgan will potentially spend C$342 million on construction of tanks and a further C$69 million on connecting pipelines and infrastructure. In total, the two companies will build 12 crude storage tanks on land owned by Keyera. Commissioning on the first tanks is expected to start in the second half of 2017. “Clearly there has been a growth in demand for crude storage as volumes continue to grow in Western Canada and land is becoming pretty tight in Edmonton,” said David Smith, Keyera’s chief executive officer. “We had 80 acres of unused land and determined storage there would be a very attractive location.” Edmonton, one of Western Canada’s major crude storage and marketing hubs, is a gathering point for oil sands production before it is shipped via pipeline or rail to markets in eastern Canada and the United States. Output from the oil sands is forecast to grow to 6.4 million barrels per day by 2030, up from 3.5 million bpd in 2014, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Last week energy intelligence firm Genscape reported inventories in Edmonton hit roughly 64 percent of capacity. Smith said there is 7.2 million barrels of merchant storage available for leasing to customers in Edmonton, and 8.3 million barrels of regulated storage owned by pipeline companies Kinder Morgan and Enbridge Inc. The 4.8 million barrels of new storage is underpinned by a number of long-term take-or-pay contracts. It will be connected to Kinder Morgan’s existing Edmonton storage terminals, the Trans Mountain pipeline to Canada’s Pacific Coast and two Edmonton crude-by-rail terminals. Kinder Morgan will oversee construction and operate the new terminal once it is in service. “When this initial project is completed, we will have grown our merchant storage, exclusive of our Trans Mountain regulated storage assets, from basically zero tankage to a 12-million-barrel position in roughly a 10-year period,” said Kinder Morgan Terminals President John Schlosser.

248,KMI,Delaware judge hits El Paso pipeline deal with $171 million judgment,"(Reuters) - A Delaware judge found an affiliate of El Paso Corp liable for $171 million for overpaying in a pipeline deal, a ruling that could bolster the legal power of investors in an increasingly popular investment vehicle used in the energy sector. The judgment is one of the largest from the Delaware Court of Chancery, which is among the country’s busiest venues for investor lawsuits.  The opinion blasted directors and advisors for showing indifference to the investors in a master limited partnership (MLP) controlled by El Paso.  Energy companies have used MLPs to hold assets with steady cash flows, like pipelines. The structures are popular with investors because they deliver higher dividends but have also been far more insulated from investor lawsuits than a corporation.  “You might have thought they were impregnable,” said Larry Hamermesh of the Widener University School of Law in Wilmington. For that reason, the ruling and any possible appeal will be closely watched to see if investors in publicly traded MLPs gain more protections akin to shareholders in corporations. The lawsuit centered on the sale of two natural gas-related subsidiaries of El Paso to El Paso Pipeline Partners, an MLP controlled by the parent company.  The 2011 lawsuit was brought by a holder of common units of the MLP. The unitholder alleged the MLP overpaid for the subsidiaries for the benefit of the parent company. Judge Travis Laster found the directors for the MLP caved to parent company demands and approved a deal they had criticized in private. “Their actions evidenced conscious indifference to their responsibilities to El Paso MLP,” Laster wrote in Monday’s opinion.  El Paso and the MLP were acquired by Kinder Morgan Inc after the deals at the center of the lawsuit were completed. Kinder Morgan said it was disappointed by the ruling and it continued to believe the deals were in the best interest of the MLP. It said it was considering an appeal once outstanding issues in the cases were resolved. Attorneys for the general partner, which controlled the MLP, and the general partner’s directors did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did attorneys for the plaintiff.  The directors had argued the deal was fair because it would increase the distributions to holders of common units. Laster also criticized the work of the investment bank, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, which advised the three-member committee of the general partner that controlled the MLP. “Instead of helping the committee develop alternatives, identify arguments, and negotiate with the controller, Tudor sought to make the price that parent proposed look fair,” Laster wrote.  Tudor, which was not a defendant, did not respond to a request for a comment.  The El Paso case was what is known as a derivative lawsuit, meaning any judgment is generally for the benefit of the company, not investors.

251,KMI,Georgia denies key permit for Kinder's Palmetto pipeline,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The state of Georgia’s top transportation official has denied Kinder Morgan Inc’s request for a key permit to build a $1.12 billion gasoline and distillate pipeline through the southeast part of the state. In a letter dated Monday, Georgia’s Department of Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurray said he had determined that Kinder’s proposed 360-mile (579 km) Palmetto Pipeline is not critical enough to allow the company to condemn property and obtain easements along its route to allow its construction. “There is substantial evidence that the construction of the proposed pipeline will not constitute a public convenience and necessity,” McMurray said in the letter addressed to an attorney representing Kinder in the matter, a copy of which was received by Reuters. Kinder Morgan was “evaluating all options to move forward with the project,” Ron McClain, the company’s head of products pipelines, said in a statement on Tuesday. The company did not elaborate on those options, but Georgia DOT spokeswoman Natalie Dale said on Tuesday that Kinder can appeal, “likely to a court.” The 167,000 barrels per day (bpd) Palmetto Pipeline would run from Belton, South Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida. The project would also involve more storage tanks and pump stations to add 125,000 bpd of capacity on part of Kinder’s 3,100-mile-long, 700,000 bpd Louisiana-to-Virginia Plantation Pipeline system. That new capacity would stretch from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to the Palmetto connection in South Carolina. Most refined fuels in the region move by truck and Savannah has two marine terminals that receive vessels carrying products. McMurray said multiple petroleum suppliers compete in those markets and there is no evidence Palmetto would affect prices. Kinder’s McClain said on Tuesday that the project was “vehemently opposed” by some suppliers seeking to maintain “artificially higher prices.” Kinder also had argued that the project would satisfy growing fuel demand in the Georgia region, but McMurray countered that demand has retreated since a 2006 high and is not expected to reach those levels through 2020. Kinder said 88 percent of the proposed route is next to existing power lines, pipelines, roadways and railways and more than 80 percent of affected landowners have agreed to property surveys. “We understand and are sensitive to the issues surrounding the potential use of eminent domain, which is rarely used,” McClain said.

254,KMI,Kinder Morgan to start up second Texas condensate splitter in July,"HOUSTON, June 25 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc aims to start up its second condensate splitter at its Houston Ship Channel complex next month, a spokeswoman said. The 50,000 barrels per day splitter is slated to begin commissioning next week to test all systems leading to startup, the spokeswoman said. Kinder Morgan started up the first of two 50,000 bpd splitters in late March after delays in delivery of manufacturer parts and weather issues pushed startup from mid-2014. Due to the boom in output of condensate in the U.S. shale plays, the oil industry is investing up to $2.4 billion in condensate splitters to “split” the very light form of crude into components like jet fuel, diesel and naphtha, a building block for gasoline, to sell domestically or export. It is more sophisticated than an oilfield stabilizer, which removes natural gas liquids from condensate, but does not make finished motor fuels like a refinery. BP Plc has a 10-year deal to buy all the output from both splitters. Magellan Midstream Partners has a similar deal with Trafigura for a 50,000 bpd splitter under construction in Corpus Christi, Texas. U.S. regulators say stabilized condensate qualifies as an exportable refined product, so companies can export it without having to run it through a splitter first. Some planned splitter projects have been altered or put on hold as companies gauge whether to move forward or build cheaper stabilizers.

255,KMI,"UPDATE 1-Kinder Morgan considering LPG, product and potential crude exports","(Adds comments details from Kinder Morgan executive, background) By Kristen Hays HOUSTON, July 15 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc is considering more export opportunities from Texas and the U.S. Northeast, including liquid petroleum gas, refined products and potentially crude, a top executive told analysts on Wednesday. “The market is very ripe in Houston right now, it’s just a matter of which product makes the most sense,” John Schlosser, head of Kinder Morgan’s terminals division, said during a quarterly earnings call. Kinder Morgan already exports refined products and has increased its docks to 12 from four at its Houston Ship Channel complex. Those expansions accommodate nearby refiners seeking to increase exports. U.S. petroleum product exports rose 500,000 barrels per day to an average of 4.1 million bpd in the first four months of 2015 compared with the same span last year, and 40 percent of the increase was gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Schlosser indicated Kinder Morgan is more interested in  refined product export capacity than that for LPGs or crude, though all are under consideration. LPG projects are “very profitable” and could compete with potential crude projects and other expansions, “but we see more opportunities on the clean side, more so than the other two,” he said. A decades-old ban prohibits domestic crude exports, but U.S. regulators allow exports of a very light form of crude known as condensate if minimally processed. Condensate makes up about half of Eagle Ford shale output in Texas, and is increasingly produced in other U.S. shale oilfields. Kinder Morgan operates a 300,000 bpd pipeline that moves Eagle Ford crude and condensate to Houston. That line also is connected to the Kinder/Magellan Midstream Partners  joint-venture Double Eagle pipeline that moves Eagle Ford condensate to Corpus Christi, Texas. Kinder Morgan this month started up the second of two 50,000 bpd condensate splitters that split the very light crude into other components like naphtha, a building block for gasoline, and distillates. BP Plc has a 10-year agreement to buy all the output from both units. Companies can export condensate with less sophisticated processing in smaller, cheaper stabilizers, which remove natural gas liquids, but don’t make motor fuels.

261,KMI,CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-Total Port Arthur refinery cuts production after worker killed -sources,"(Corrects to show the crane’s owner is unknown, not Kinder Morgan, in 9th paragraph) HOUSTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Total SA cut production at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery on Saturday after a contract worker was killed when the bulldozer he was driving in a pit beneath a giant refining unit flipped over in petroleum coke and coarse dust, said sources familiar with plant operations. Total and the worker’s employer, Kinder Morgan Inc, both confirmed the worker’s death. Kinder Morgan operates a petroleum coke terminal in Port Arthur. Total’s Tricia Fuller said coker operations were at minimal rates and operators had stopped taking coke from the unit due to the death. The sources said production at the 225,500 barrel per day (bpd) refinery’s other units had been reduced. “We will restart (the coker) once we know it can be operated safely,” Fuller said. The coker was not damaged in the incident, the sources said. Investigators from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) were expected to open an investigation Saturday, Fuller said. Generally, U.S. refineries do not need permission from safety or environmental regulators to resume production following a fatality. Bulldozers were being used to push coke and coarse sand-like coke dust from beneath the 60,000 bpd delayed coking unit because a crane, the owner of which was unknown on Saturday, that is usually used to remove coke from the pit had been shut for repairs for several months, the sources said. Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Sara Hughes said she had no further information about the accident beyond confirmation of the worker’s death. “An investigation is being conducted,” Hughes said. Petroleum coke, which can be used as a coal substitute, is made from the gunky, black residual crude that remains after all refinable material has been obtained from it. In a delayed coking unit, residual crude is injected into giant drums where it is heated until it hardens, a process that usually takes 24-48 hours. The coke is knocked out of the drums by high pressure jets of scalding water and falls into the coke pit beneath. Total is currently seeking a partner to purchase a 50-percent stake in the Port Arthur Refinery.

Total is considering bringing in additional feedstocks to boost gasoline output while the refinery’s production is reduced, the sources said. A Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department official said the preliminary results of an autopsy show that Thomas Courts, 66, of Denton, Texas, drowned in the large pit beneath the coker after the bulldozer he was driving flipped over early on Saturday. “The investigation is ongoing, and we are working with Kinder Morgan to implement a plan to return to full service,” Total spokeswoman Wendy Ashworth said. “We are operating at minimum capacity until such time.” Courts was using the bulldozer to push petroleum coke from the pit for loading, according to Jefferson County Assistant Chief Deputy Sheriff Rod Carroll. The pit is located beneath giant drums where residual crude oil is heated to harden into petroleum coke, which can be used as a coal substitute. The coke is removed using high-pressure hot water jets. The pit where Courts was working contained coke, coarse sandy coke dust and scalding water, according to Carroll. Courts was a Kinder Morgan Inc employee. The company operates a petroleum coke terminal in Port Arthur. Courts also suffered third-to-second degree burns over his body, Carroll said. A Kinder Morgan spokeswoman said the company is working with Total to restore the refinery’s production. Sources have told Reuters that bulldozers were operating in the coke pit because a giant crane normally used to remove coke and coke dust has been out of service for several months. One source called it an “operational hazard” to have people working in the coke pit.

264,KMI,Canadian regulators delay review of Trans Mountain pipeline,"CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Canada’s National Energy Board said on Thursday it has delayed the release of its recommendation report on Kinder Morgan Inc’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion by five months to acquire additional information on the project. Kinder Morgan is seeking approval from regulators to nearly triple the capacity of its existing 300,000 barrels per day Trans Mountain line from Edmonton to Canada’s Pacific Coast to 890,000 bpd. The report will give the NEB’s recommendations on whether the pipeline expansion should go ahead, and is now expected to be released by May 20, 2016. Previously, it was scheduled to be released on Jan. 26, 2016. “We have received the updated steps and process from the NEB. We are currently reviewing the timeline and whether there are any implications to our project,” Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Ali Hounsell said. Kinder Morgan currently has construction scheduled to start in the third quarter of 2016 and anticipates the pipeline will be in service by the third quarter of 2018. The NEB has 15 months from the date it determines a project application is complete to issue a decision or recommendation, but is allowed to exclude periods of time from that 15-month limit, effectively pausing the review. After receiving a recommendation from the NEB, the federal government would have up to three months to make a final decision. This is the second time regulators have imposed an exclusion period on the Trans Mountain application. It comes as a result of a decision by the hearing panel on Aug. 21 to strike evidence in favour of the pipeline prepared by consultant Steven Kelly, who was recently appointed to the NEB. Regulators were concerned that including evidence from Kelly would lead to questions about the impartiality of the review process.

265,KMI,"Kinder Morgan, BP form fuel storage JV","(Reuters) - BP Plc (BP.L) will sell 15 fuel storage terminals in the United States to pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) in a $350 million deal, as it sheds assets to pay for liabilities arising from its 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said earlier this month that BP would have to pay more than $20 billion in fines to resolve claims arising from the Macondo well blowout, which killed 11 workers and spewed more than three million barrels of crude oil into the sea. BP has said its total pre-tax charge for the disaster is now about $53.8 billion. The two companies will form a joint venture to hold 14 of the 15 terminals being sold. Kinder Morgan will have a 75 percent stake in the venture with BP holding the rest.  The pipeline company will have sole ownership of one terminal. “It (deal) enables BP to maintain strategic access to terminals nationwide, while reducing operating costs and complexity,” said Doug Sparkman, a BP executive.   BP will continue to use the terminals as key distribution hubs for gasoline and other refined products, the company said. The terminals, which can store about 9.5 million barrels of refined products, are located across the United States.  However, the deal does not include all of BP’s U.S. fuel storage terminals. The company will continue to own terminals in Indiana, Iowa, Oregon, Washington and New Jersey.

The company said it expects to increase its dividend by 6-10 percent in 2016. For 2015, the dividend is on track to grow 15 percent from a year ago. Analysts on a conference call peppered Executive Chairman Rich Kinder with questions about the dividend. He emphasized the new guidance was just a range and said the company has only started to work on its budget for next year. Executives stressed they were trying to strike a balance between investing in their business, avoiding dilutive equity raisings, keeping investment grade credit ratings, and paying a healthy dividend. “We are going to be flexible in the future with respect to the dividend,” said CFO Kim Dang. The company said it was planning to use an “alternative source” of funding that would allow it to refrain from tapping equity markets until the middle of next year. It did not offer details, but analysts say private equity funds are increasingly trying to move into the energy space. It also said it is starting to see opportunities for acquisitions over the next 6-12 months, after a joint venture announced this week that included BP Plc’s U.S. terminals. Third-quarter net income attributable to Kinder Morgan fell nearly 43.5 percent, hurt by softening demand for domestic steel and continued weakness in global coal prices. “While we are largely insulated from commodity price impacts due to our predominately take-or-pay supported cash flows, we are not totally immune,” Kinder said. The Houston-based company raised its quarterly dividend to 51 cents per share from 44 cents, which will help the company meet its full-year dividend target of $2 per share. The higher quarterly dividend equated to an annual payout of $2.04 per share.

274,KMI,UPDATE 2-Canada says pipeline reviews proceed despite change to process,"(Adds Greenpeace comment, Trudeau quote from August) By Randall Palmer OTTAWA, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Canada’s environmental review of existing applications for crude oil pipeline projects is continuing despite the new Liberal government’s plans to make the assessment process more robust, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said on Wednesday. “They have not stopped. The process continues,” he told reporters on a conference call. “There will be a transition as we amend the ways in which the National Energy Board goes about the process of evaluating these projects, and we will announce those changes as soon as we can, but the process continues.” The Liberal government’s pledge to toughen up the environmental review process for oil pipelines had raised the question of whether existing applications would require resubmission. Key projects are TransCanada Corp’s application for the Energy East pipeline to take oil from Alberta and Saskatchewan to the East Coast, and the expansion of Kinder Morgan Inc’s Trans Mountain Pipeline to the Pacific. Specifically addressing the Kinder Morgan application, Carr said the review was going ahead. He appeared less clear when asked about Energy East: “I understand that any changes that we make to the process will have an effect on projects. I know that it’s important, and we will be reviewing the situation and we will give you the results as soon as we can.” The minister said the government was committed to a process that has the confidence of Canadians. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, while campaigning in October for election, had said it was up to communities to decide whether to support Energy East. “It is not up to government to support one project or another, it is up for a government to set the framework within which communities can choose, or not, to support a project,” he said at the time. Nonetheless, Carr reiterated on Wednesday the government’s opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway pipeline. Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Keith Stewart, referring to Trans Mountain, said he did not see “how the Trudeau government can continue with the review of a pipeline under rules that Trudeau has denounced for ignoring climate impacts, failing to respect indigenous rights, and lacking a grounding in sound science.” He pointed to video footage (goo.gl/eVBmxS) of Trudeau saying in August that the new environmental process would apply to the Kinder Morgan line. Trudeau said it would not be approved in January because there would be a new Liberal government ""and that process needs to be redone.""

275,KMI,Kinder Morgan on hook for $171 mln judgment tied to El Paso deal,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Energy pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc is on the hook for the bulk of $171 million in damages owed to investors in an affiliate of El Paso Corp, which Kinder Morgan acquired in 2014, a Delaware judge ruled on Wednesday. The ruling follows a decision in April that found investors in a master limited partnership, or MLP, were shortchanged when it overpaid in a 2011 pipeline deal with El Paso, which controlled the MLP. The April ruling set the damage award, which is among the largest judgments of its kind by the Court of Chancery, a key venue for corporate disputes. On Wednesday, Vice Chancellor Travis Laster rejected Kinder Morgan’s arguments to dismiss the case because last year it acquired control of both El Paso and the MLP, El Paso Pipeline Partners. Kinder Morgan essentially had argued that one of its controlled affiliates now owned the litigation and investors lacked standing to sue. Laster said in his 110-page opinion that dismissing the case would “generate a windfall” for Kinder Morgan at the expense of the limited partners who brought the case. Kinder Morgan, or KMI, said it was disappointed by the ruling and that the contested deal was appropriate and in the best interests of the MLP. “KMI is evaluating all options and intends to pursue an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court,” the Houston-based company said in a statement. It said it had recorded a reserve for the lawsuit, had insurance and that any damages it ultimately might pay would not have any material financial impact. Laster did find that Kinder Morgan was only liable for 58.6 percent of the judgment, which represented the portion of the MLP owned by independent investors. He said 41.4 percent of the common units were held by Kinder Morgan and its affiliates. The lawsuit was brought by Peter Brinckerhoff, a holder of common units of the MLP, who alleged the MLP overpaid for two natural gas subsidiaries of El Paso for the benefit of the parent company. Laster found the directors of the MLP caved in to parent company demands and approved a deal they had criticized in private. The directors had argued the deal was fair because it would increase the distributions to holders of common units.

279,KMI,UPDATE 1-Pipeline giant Kinder Morgan slashes dividend 75 percent,"(Adds details, quotes) HOUSTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc slashed its dividend 75 percent on Tuesday, marking the first time the U.S. pipeline giant has cut payouts to shareholders since it has been a publicly traded company. The move, which will reduce the annual dividend to 50 cents a share from about $2 a share, is an acknowledgement that the worst oil price crash in six years is hurting once-resilient pipeline companies. Kinder Morgan shares have shed about half their value since the company first warned on Oct. 21 that payouts would slow. In after hours trade on Tuesday the shares fell nearly 7 percent to $14.67. Moody’s put the company on credit watch negative last week after it bought a stake in a leveraged natural gas pipeline system, and several analysts downgraded the stock. Founder Rich Kinder said the smaller payout to investors would allow Kinder Morgan to avoid issuing equity while maintaining its investment grade credit rating. “We evaluated numerous options, including significant asset sales, but ultimately concluded that these other options were uneconomic to our investors in the long run. This decision was not made lightly,” he said in a statement. Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt told clients in a note that  the cash would be better spent reinvesting or buying back shares. “We’d argue that while market clearly hates the possibility of a dividend cut, a full payout is the least effective use for that cash.” Once the darlings of investors, growth prospects of pipeline companies have been undercut by a 50 percent slide in oil prices and tough environmental reviews that have delayed projects. Pipeline companies have been especially popular with investors in recent years for their ability consistently to pay and grow large dividends. But their attractiveness has faded since at least the summer as executives at some of the biggest pipeline companies, including Plains All American LP, have warned of slower or variable dividend growth. Investors say they are skittish over the prospect of rising U.S. interest rates, a dimmer outlook for additional new volumes of oil and natural gas flowing onto new midstream systems, as well as the potential for lower shipments and fees on existing lines.

283,KMI,Kinder Morgan files final argument for Canadian pipeline expansion,"CALGARY, Alberta, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc  filed its final written argument for the Trans Mountain crude oil pipeline expansion project with Canadian regulators on Tuesday, in a bid to gain approval for shipping more oil sands crude to the Pacific Coast. The pipeline currently ships 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Edmonton, Alberta, to Burnaby, British Columbia. The proposed expansion will nearly treble capacity to 890,000 bpd, providing more access to Asian markets. Environmental groups, aboriginal groups and local landowners in British Columbia have mounted fierce opposition to the project, and are fighting to block the expansion. Many pipeline opposition groups have been emboldened by U.S. President Barack Obama’s rejection earlier this year of TransCanada Corp’s cross-border Keystone XL pipeline, and are seeking to stall other proposed export routes. Kinder Morgan first filed its facilities application with Canada’s National Energy Board in December 2013, but was required to file replacement evidence for a 64-page report prepared by a consultant who was later appointed to the NEB. Lawyers for the pipeline will deliver their oral summary of the final argument to the National Energy Board in Calgary on Thursday.

284,KMI,British Columbia to oppose Kinder Morgan's pipeline expansion,"(Reuters) - The British Columbia government said on Monday it will formally oppose the expansion of Kinder Morgan Inc’s Trans Mountain pipeline to Canada’s west coast, another blow to oil sands producers already reeling from a global crude price crash. Kinder Morgan wants to nearly treble Trans Mountain’s capacity to carry 890,000 barrels per day of crude from landlocked Alberta, to Burnaby, British Columbia, where it can be loaded on to tankers and shipped to lucrative Asian refining markets. Alberta’s carbon-intensive oil sands producers are desperate for improved access to international markets for their heavy crude, which is among the cheapest in the world and was priced at about $16.50 a barrel outright late Thursday afternoon. But the C$5.4 billion ($3.79 billion) project has run into fierce environmental and aboriginal opposition. British Columbia Environment Minister Mary Polak said Kinder Morgan had failed to provide the National Energy Board (NEB), a federal regulator, with an adequate plan to prevent or respond to an oil spill. In 2012 the province’s premier, Christy Clark, outlined five conditions that any company wanting to build pipelines in British Columbia would need to meet to win approval from her Liberal government. These included a “world-leading” marine and land oil spill prevention, response and recovery practices.     “We have not seen evidence that convinces us that those five conditions have been met,” Polak told reporters. The British Columbia government did not entirely rule out the possibility of Kinder Morgan meeting their requirements in future, adding that it will continue to evaluate the project. “It does not close the door on them meeting that test in the future,” Polak said. Kinder Morgan is confident that it will be able to satisfy British Columbia’s conditions by the time the regulatory process is complete, it said in a statement. It could not meet all the requirements such as Aboriginal treaty rights alone and needed “multiple parties” to work together, the company said. Kinder Morgan filed a final written argument for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project with Canadian regulators in December. The opposition to Trans Mountain’s expansion comes after U.S. President Barack Obama in November rejected TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL pipeline in a victory for environmentalists.

Kinder Morgan shares surged as much as 20 percent to $14.45 in morning trading on Thursday, a day after the company reported a fourth-quarter adjusted profit that beat some analysts’ expectations.

294,KMI,Kinder Morgan swings to loss on $1.15 billion charge,"(Reuters) - U.S. pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) swung to a fourth-quarter loss after a $1.15 billion writedown on natural gas assets, and said weak commodity and stock markets could bring more trouble. “Let me give you this warning, if commodity and equity prices continue to fall, then we may have impairments in future quarters,” Chief Financial Officer Kimberly Allen Dang told analysts on a quarterly earnings call on Wednesday. Kinder Morgan, the largest energy infrastructure company in North America, cut its 2016 capital budget to $3.3 billion from its previous estimate of $4.2 billion, based on West Texas Intermediate crude oil trading at $38 per barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 for February delivery, which expired on Wednesday, fell 6.7 percent to settle at $26.55, under $27 a barrel for the first time since 2003. [O/R] Kinder Morgan, which also disclosed a $285 million writedown mainly in its carbon dioxide segment, said it does not expect to access the capital markets to fund growth projects in 2016. The Houston-based company, once resilient in the face of falling oil prices, last month cut its dividend, by 75 percent, for the first time since going public to maintain cash. President and Chief Executive Steven Kean said the company shaved its capital budget largely by dropping acquisitions, which he did not identify, cutting costs and lowering carbon dioxide spending. The company also delayed completion of $5.4 billion Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion by a year, to the third quarter of 2019, as it awaited regulatory approval. The capacity expansion, to 890,000 bpd from 300,000 bpd, has met fierce environmental and aboriginal opposition. One shareholder on the conference call raised concerns about continued capital spending. “Now there’s the fear that the dividend isn’t even secure,” he said. “I’m the largest shareholder,” Chairman Rich Kinder responded, noting that the company would use cash flow as it saw best given volatile market conditions. “I want to see all kinds of value derived by the common shareholders of this company.” Kinder Morgan posted a net loss of $637 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $126 million a year earlier. Excluding items, profit fell to $491 million from $664 million. Revenue dropped 8 percent to $3.63 billion. Kinder Morgan shares hit a record low of $11.20 on Wednesday, before trading down 2.6 percent at $11.70 after hours.

296,KMI,"Investor gets $450,000 fee for leading Kinder Morgan lawsuit","WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A former investment banker landed a so-called incentive fee of $450,000, one of the largest of its kind, for pursuing a securities lawsuit that led to $100 million in damages against Kinder Morgan Inc. Peter Brinckerhoff of Florida was awarded the fee for putting in more than 1,500 hours on the case, which resulted in one of the largest damage awards in the history of Delaware’s Court of Chancery, which heard the case. The lawsuit benefited other investors who did not actively participate in the litigation. “I don’t know if it’s the largest ever, but it’s remarkably large for a securities case,” said Geoffrey Miller, a professor at New York University Law School who has researched incentive awards. Several plaintiffs and defense attorneys who specialize in securities class action cases said it was the largest incentive award they had seen. Brinckerhoff brought the suit in 2010 to challenge a deal by El Paso Pipeline Partners, a publicly traded master limited partnership. Vice Chancellor Travis Laster of the Court of Chancery ruled last year that the MLP overpaid when it acquired pipeline assets from its controlling parent, El Paso Corp. The judge ordered the overpayment returned to El Paso Pipeline’s investors. Kinder Morgan later acquired El Paso, and is on the hook for the damages. Brinckerhoff had sought $1.35 million, a figure his lawyers conceded in court papers was “unusual,” to compensate him for spending five years working on the case. Brinckerhoff was an investment banker who retired from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 1991, according to court documents. He could not be reached for comment. Incentive awards have been criticized as “bounties” that encourage wasteful class actions, and in 2003 Congress briefly considered banning them in federal courts. Laster, who approved the award, has a reputation for being tough on fees when he questions the value of the litigation. In Brinckerhoff’s case, Laster awarded $33 million for lawyers with Rosenthal, Monhait & Goddess and Bragar Eagel & Squire. Lawyers for the law firms did not respond to a request for comment.

299,KMI,Chesapeake Energy woes cast shadow on U.S. pipeline companies,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas pipeline companies including Williams Companies Inc and Kinder Morgan Inc have contracts worth billions of dollars that might be at risk as Chesapeake Energy Corp aims to slash its debts amid collapsing energy prices. Chesapeake said on Monday it had no plans to file for bankruptcy after sources told Reuters the firm, whose debt is eight times its market value, had asked its longtime counsel to look at restructuring options. The way it deals with its financial woes could be a lifeline or death sentence for midstream pipeline companies. Often called the energy market’s “toll takers,” they have long-term contracts with producers such as Chesapeake to move, process and store energy products, experts said. Many of these companies are master-limited partnerships, or MLPs.  Chesapeake said it has commitments to pay about $2 billion a year for space on pipelines run by MLPs, federal filings show. During the U.S. shale boom, investors flocked to MLPs, which were growing as much as 8 percent a year. But investors have fled in droves out of fear that the companies will not maintain their hefty dividend-style distributions. But with oil prices at their lowest in 12 years due to a global supply glut with OPEC unwilling to slow production, profits at energy companies have plummeted and analysts do not expect any significant price recovery until at least 2017. Williams has the most exposure to Chesapeake after buying Chesapeake’s logistics assets for $6 billion in 2014, Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager of New York-based InfraCap, said. Other companies with contracts include Spectra Energy Partners LP, Columbia Pipeline Partners LP and Marathon Petroleum Corp’s unit MPLX LP, according to SEC filings. These long-term contracts, often referred to as minimum volume commitments, were supposed to protect MLPs from major oil and gas price drops, because they include so-called minimum volume commitments, where customers pay pipeline operators whether they move any oil or not.  But the latest leg down in crude’s 19-month plunge has cast doubt over the perceived safety of those contracts as producers try to navigate the oil crisis. Experts said they expect Chesapeake will try to renegotiate contract terms, which would be the first major test of these deals and the so-called midstream companies that flourished during the U.S. shale boom. Williams and Chesapeake announced in September they renegotiated a batch of gathering and processing contracts, shifting away from minimum commitments to fee-based agreements. The deals were considered precedent setting at the time.   Williams declined to comment. Another risk is it could file for bankruptcy protection, which could give it the option discontinuing or renegotiating commercial contracts. Hatfield said he expects Williams will be forced to accept a 50-percent price cut in its contract price with Chesapeake, either through the courts or mutual renegotiation. That translates to a drop of about $300 million in annual cash flow for the $4 billion company.  “It’s not good, but it’s not the end of the world,” Hatfield said. In a note issued on Monday, Credit Suisse said the loss of its minimum volume commitments with Chesapeake would likely wipe out most of Williams’ cash flows connected to those contracts. It said the losses could be up to $400 million. Its shares plunged 35 percent to $11.16 on Monday on the Chesapeake news along with a management change at its bidder, Energy Transfer Equity LP. “Certainly on the midstream side, everyone realizes that midstream isn’t bulletproof,” Doug Getten, a partner in the Securities and Capital Markets practice at Paul Hastings in Houston, said. A Spectra spokesman said its Chesapeake contract to supply gas out of the Marcellus region accounted for less than 3 percent of its 2015 revenues. Kinder Morgan, which scrapped the MLP model in 2014 but still remains an industry bellwether, did not disclose its exposure to Chesapeake, but a spokesman said the company continues to closely monitor its counterparty credit risk. Columbia Pipeline said it would respond to these questions in an upcoming investor call. Marathon’s logistics arm did not reply to requests for comment.

300,KMI,Buffett's Berkshire raises oil bet with Kinder Morgan stake,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Tuesday disclosed a new investment in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), boosting its bet on the oil industry as crude prices hover near 12-year lows. Berkshire owned about 26.53 million Kinder Morgan shares worth roughly $395.9 million at year end, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock investments. Shares of Kinder Morgan rallied in after-hours trading, rising $1.08, or 6.9 percent, to $16.70. They had closed up 66 cents at $15.62 in regular trading. It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in Kinder Morgan, though investments of this size are often not Buffett’s. Nonetheless, investors often view such disclosures as a signal of where Buffett and his deputies see value. Berkshire has also been boosting its stake in Phillips 66 (PSX.N), and as of Friday had spent $1.08 billion this year on the oil refiner’s stock. That gave it a 14.3 percent stake now worth about $5.91 billion. Kinder Morgan shares have fallen by nearly two-thirds since April as falling oil prices CLc1 cut into profitability. That plunge has prompted the Houston-based company to lower capital spending, and in December cut its dividend for the first time. “KMI has many of the qualities Buffett looks for in his investments, including stable, fee-based assets which generate significant amounts of cash flow,” Morningstar Inc analyst Peggy Connerty said in an email, referring to Kinder Morgan’s ticker. Given the stock price decline, and Kinder Morgan’s plan to improve its balance sheet without issuing new shares this year, “for a long-term oriented investor KMI is a decent name to own,” she said. Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Melissa Ruiz said: “We are pleased that others see the value in the company that we see.” According to Tuesday’s filing, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) remained Berkshire’s biggest U.S. stock holding at $26.08 billion, followed by Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) at $23.69 billion. A stake in International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) declined by nearly $600 million in the quarter to $11.15 billion. Berkshire also reported boosting its share stake in Deere & Co (DE.N) and cutting its share stake in AT&T; Inc (T.N). Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear and Geico auto insurance.

Nine of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by the 1.6 percent rise in the materials sector. The benchmark S&P; 500 index staged its best two-day gain since late August over the past two days as investors snatched up beaten-down shares. Still, the S&P; 500 has fallen 7.3 percent this year due to slumping oil prices, fears of a China-led slowdown in global growth and uncertainty about central bank policies. The price of Brent crude oil, a major international benchmark, was up about 3 percent, holding onto its gains despite Iran refusing to be part of a group of top oil producers to freeze output. The agreement to stabilize production, along with the acceptance of accommodative monetary policy in Europe, relative stability in the Chinese yuan has helped calm frayed nerves globally, said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. “We do not see, for the moment, additional selling pressure in the coming week as market speculators absorb this much-needed mood,” Morganlander said. He expects the markets to stay in a tight trading range. At 9:39 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 136.86 points, or 0.85 percent, at 16,333.27. The S&P; 500 was up 17.49 points, or 0.92 percent, at 1,913.07 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 42.51 points, or 0.96 percent, at 4,478.47. Kinder Morgan were up 10.9 percent at $17.32 after Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a stake in the pipeline operator. Fossil was up 19.5 percent at $41.16 after the watchmaker’s quarterly results beat estimates. Priceline was 11.4 percent higher at $1,237 after the travel websites operator’s profit beat expectations. Data released on Wednesday showed that U.S. housing starts unexpectedly fell in January. A separate report showed producer prices rose last month and there were signs of an uptick in underlying producer inflation. Inflation is being watched closely for signs of whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Investors will get an insight on the Fed’s thinking when the minutes of the central bank’s January meeting are released at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Janet Yellen has maintained that the central bank is still likely to raise rates in 2016. However, Fed funds futures suggest traders do not expect any increases this year. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,416 to 339. On the Nasdaq, 1,805 issues rose and 389 fell.

312,KMI,UPDATE 3-Canada regulator approves Kinder Morgan pipeline with conditions,"(Adds opposition and challenges to the pipeline) By Julie Gordon VANCOUVER, May 19 (Reuters) - Canada’s energy regulator on Thursday recommended the approval of Kinder Morgan Inc’s  plan to expand its Trans Mountain oil pipeline, subject to 157 conditions, clearing a major hurdle for the proposed trebling of capacity to serve lucrative Asian markets. The National Energy Board (NEB) said it found the C$6.8 billion ($5.19 billion) project, which would boost capacity from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 bpd, would not cause significant harm to the environment. The decision prompted immediate outcry from critics, who called on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to block the twinning of the existing pipeline, which carries oil from Alberta to a port in Metro Vancouver. Trudeau’s cabinet has until December to review the NEB’s 533-page report and make its final decision. If approved, legal experts say protests and a flood of lawsuits from aboriginal groups will likely follow. Aboriginals in British Columbia never signed treaties and have been granted “consent” rights by the courts, sometimes interpreted as a veto. But Trudeau told Reuters on Thursday that while community consultation was vital, aboriginal groups do not have a veto over pipeline development. Building new oil pipelines in Canada has proven difficult in recent years, even with approvals. Enbridge Inc’s  Northern Gateway pipeline was greenlighted in 2014, but fierce legal and social opposition has so far hindered construction. That has weighed on Canada’s oil sands producers, who are desperate for new lines to get their product to international markets, where it can fetch a higher price. The NEB said it had determined the “considerable benefits” of the Trans Mountain expansion outweighed the “residual burdens.” It also found that with mitigation measures and its conditions, the project “would not likely cause significant adverse environmental effects.” The agency did note that there would be significant effects related to the increase in oil tanker traffic, though marine shipping is not regulated by the NEB. The expansion would boost oil tanker and barge traffic on Vancouver’s waters nearly five-fold. Twinning the Trans Mountain pipeline will include the construction of nearly 1,000 km (621 miles) of new pipeline and the expansion of an existing marine terminal. If approved by cabinet, the company said construction could start in 2017, with the first shipments in 2019. A ministerial panel, named earlier this week, is now tasked with consulting with aboriginal groups and other communities on the proposal, with their report due in November.

317,KMI,UPDATE 2-Vancouver takes legal action to block Kinder Morgan pipeline plan,"(Adds comments from company, regulator) By Julie Gordon VANCOUVER, June 20 (Reuters) - The City of Vancouver said on Monday it had taken legal action against the Canadian energy regulator’s approval of Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which would increase the number of oil tankers passing through city waters. In a statement posted on the city’s website, Mayor Gregor Robertson called the review by the National Energy Board (NEB) “flawed and biased” and said that it ignored scientific evidence on the consequences of a major oil spill and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. The city filed its application for judicial review at the Federal Court of Appeal in Vancouver on Friday. The suit aims to quash the NEB’s recommendation in favour of Kinder Morgan’s plan to nearly treble capacity on the pipeline, which carries crude from Alberta to a port in Metro Vancouver. The regulator said last month that it had found the C$6.8 billion ($5.31 billion) project, which would boost capacity from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 bpd and the number of oil tankers in Vancouver waters nearly seven-fold, would not cause significant harm to the environment. But critics, who say the project will hasten the development of Alberta’s oil sands and worry about the impact of an oil spill on Canada’s west coast, were quick to pledge action against the regulator’s decision. The Squamish First Nation, whose traditional territories include areas directly impacted by the pipeline and shipping routes, filed an application for judicial review late last week. Environmental groups have also taken legal action. The regulator declined to comment on the specific court actions, noting that the scope of its review of projects such as the Trans Mountain expansion is mandated under federal law. Ali Hounsell, a spokeswoman for the expansion project, said the company is reviewing the applications and “will be responding more fully through the court process.” The NEB’s recommendation on the project must still be reviewed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet, with a final decision expected in December.

326,KMI,Kinder Morgan shuts natgas pipelines after fire in Texas,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc said on Tuesday it shut several natural gas pipeline segments near the King Ranch gas processing plant in Kleberg County, Texas, after a fire on Monday morning. The incident occurred in the area of a supply header where several pipes are connected, said Kinder Morgan spokesman Richard Wheatley. He said no Kinder Morgan employees were hurt in the incident, which occurred at about 9:26 a.m. CDT (1426 GMT), adding that an investigation would begin as soon as the site was judged safe and any remaining fires were put out. The incident affected service through certain Kinder Morgan segments, including the Texas pipeline, Tejas pipeline and Mexico-Monterrey pipeline, Wheatley said. “We have a team onsite and are attempting to gain full access to the location,” Wheatley said, adding he was unable to say whether the fire started with a pipe owned by Kinder Morgan or another company. A spokesman at Williams Cos Inc said gas flows on its Transco pipeline, which is connected to the King Ranch processing plant, were not affected by the incident. Officials at Energy Transfer, which owns the processing plant, were not immediately available for comment. Gas flows between the King Ranch processing plant and Kinder Morgan’s Tennessee Gas Pipeline fell to 9 million cubic feet per day on July 18, the day the fire started, but have returned to 88 mmcfd, putting the amount of fuel moving through the receipt point near its 30-day average of 91 mmcfd, according to Thomson Reuters data. Gas traders said the Texas fire was having little effect on futures prices, noting that the latest hot weather forecasts and maintenance work on the Rockies Express pipe in the Ohio/Indiana area was having a bigger impact on the market.  “We are in touch with our customers and are determining impacts to them,” Wheatley said. He could not say how much gas was flowing through the pipes before the fire or how much had been curtailed. Wheatley said gas can still flow through the affected pipes, except sections that were shut in. In a notification to the state pollution regulator on the Tejas pipeline, Kinder Morgan said “Sweet pipeline quality natural gas ignited.” The Tejas pipeline is a 3,400-mile intrastate system located primarily along the Texas Gulf Coast that transports, purchases and sells natural gas in the Texas intrastate market, according to the company website.

3,KMI,"UPDATE 3-Canada unveils carbon price, energy-producing provinces unhappy","TORONTO/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s federal government on Monday vowed to bring in a minimum price on carbon emissions by 2018, prompting one energy-producing province to threaten legal action and another to demand approval of an oil pipeline in return. Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who took power last November promising to do more to protect the environment, said carbon pollution would cost C$10 a tonne in 2018, rising by C$10 a year until it reaches C$50 in 2022. Trudeau said the 10 provinces - which have traditionally resented what they see as federal heavy handedness - could either implement a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade market by then. Those that do neither will have a price imposed by Ottawa. Trudeau said his measures would help Canada meet greenhouse gas emission cuts agreed under the Paris climate change accords. But official data show Canada has little chance of meeting its goals, in part because of booming emissions from the energy sector. Trudeau also blamed what he called inaction by the previous Conservative government. “We’re not going to shun science and we’re not going to put off the inevitable,” Trudeau told parliament, saying a carbon price would improve Canadians’ health and spur investment in green businesses. Energy-producing provinces were not impressed. Brad Wall, premier of Saskatchewan, accused Trudeau of betrayal and said he would consider legal action. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley - usually a political ally of Trudeau - said she would “not be supporting this proposal absent serious concurrent progress on energy infrastructure”. This was a reference to Kinder Morgan Inc’s proposal to twin its Trans Mountain crude pipeline from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific coast. Ottawa has until Dec. 19 to decide on the project, which is opposed by environmentalists. Trudeau said provinces would keep the revenues they collected under the new program. He spoke as federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna met provincial counterparts to work on a carbon pricing deal. In a sign of protest, three ministers left early, and a scheduled final news conference was canceled. Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta, Canada’s four most populous provinces, either already have a price on carbon or are implementing one. Green groups were largely supportive, although Environmental Defence said Trudeau’s plan was not ambitious enough. Federal legislators will vote this week on ratification of the Paris agreement to  curb climate-warming emissions, a vote that the majority Liberal government is certain to win.

6,KMI,Kinder Morgan to begin construction on Elba Liquefaction project November 1,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan (KMI.N) will begin construction on its Elba Liquefaction project near Savannah, Georgia, on Nov. 1, ahead of a final ruling from federal regulators on rehearing requested by environmental activists, the company said on Wednesday.  The company received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on June 1, but the Sierra Club and associated individuals have since filed a request for a rehearing, which is still pending FERC.  The project, which is supported by a 20-year contract with Shell, will be constructed and operated next to the existing Elba Island liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and have capacity to export 2.5 million tonnes per year of LNG.  A number of other projects under construction by the midstream giant are facing regulatory and legal hurdles at a time when energy infrastructure projects in North America are drawing increased scrutiny from environmental and native American groups.  Kinder Morgan on Wednesday said it was appealing a decision by a judge in Wood County, Ohio, who ruled the company did not qualify for eminent domain for the construction of its proposed Utopia Pipeline. That line would transport 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) of ethane and ethane-propane mix across Ohio to Windsor, Ontario.  The company has filed lawsuits for eminent domain in other counties in Ohio for construction of the line, executives said, adding they were able to obtain the property they sought. “It is typical in all of our projects that we try to avoid use of eminent domain and we negotiate with a spectrum of landowners,” executives said, noting about 65 percent of the land acquired for its pipeline construction comes through easements without eminent domain. The appeal could take months, Kinder Morgan said.  Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion, which would increase capacity on the line from 300,000 bpd to 890,000 bpd, remains under review by Canadian government, after the National Energy Board recommended its approval, subject to 157 conditions. A decision on that project is expected on Dec. 20, 2016.

7,KMI,Pipeline company Kinder Morgan's revenue misses estimates,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as its pipelines moved lower volumes of oil and gas. Pipeline companies, once seen as more insulated from commodity price swings due to fixed-fee contracts, were hit hard by a more than 60 percent slump in oil prices since mid-2014 as cash-strapped oil and gas companies renegotiated their contracts. However, Kinder Morgan said it was not hurt by any customer defaults in the third quarter. Houston-based Kinder Morgan has tried to shore up finances by selling interest in its projects. In July, Southern Co agreed to take a 50 percent stake in Kinder Morgan-operated Southern Natural Gas (SNG) pipeline system, which supplies to the U.S. southeast.

8,KMI,UPDATE 2-Pipeline company Kinder Morgan's revenue misses estimates,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as its pipelines moved lower volumes of oil and gas. Pipeline companies, once seen as more insulated from commodity price swings due to fixed-fee contracts, were hit hard by a more than 60 percent slump in oil prices since mid-2014 as cash-strapped oil and gas companies renegotiated their contracts. However, Kinder Morgan said it was not hurt by any customer defaults in the third quarter. Houston-based Kinder Morgan has tried to shore up finances by selling interest in its projects. In July, Southern Co agreed to take a 50 percent stake in Kinder Morgan-operated Southern Natural Gas (SNG) pipeline system, which supplies to the U.S. southeast.

16,KMI,Husky oil spill in Canadian river caused by ground movement,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - A Husky Energy Inc oil spill into a major Canadian river last summer that cut off drinking water supply for two cities was caused by ground movement that buckled a section of pipeline, the company said in a report to the Saskatchewan provincial government. Husky’s report, which the company made public on Thursday, said the break was not due to material defects, such as corrosion. A supporting report by engineering firm Stantec said heavy rain may have triggered the ground movement. The spill happened as the Canadian government considers whether to allow oil pipeline projects proposed by Kinder Morgan Inc and TransCanada Corp. Oil pipelines are viewed by the oil-rich provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan as critical to move crude to tidewater, but they have drawn fierce opposition from environmental and indigenous groups.   The Saskatchewan break, discovered by Husky on July 21, occurred on land about 160 metres (525 feet) from the North Saskatchewan River, and leaked an estimated 225 cubic metres (225,000 litres) of crude oil, the report said. Forty percent of the oil entered the river. Cleanup operations concluded in October accounted for 210 cubic metres. The spill forced the cities of Prince Albert and North Battleford to temporarily find alternative sources of drinking water. The province said in September that it had recorded 148 wildlife deaths, including birds and fish. “We know the impact this incident had on communities and would like to acknowledge the extraordinary assistance we’ve received throughout,” Husky spokesman Mel Duvall said in an email. “From the beginning we have taken full responsibility and continue to do so.” Husky said it will review leak detection procedures and ensure ground movement risks to pipelines are monitored. Regulators continue to review the incident. ",11172016,http://www.reuters.com/article/pipeline-operations-husky-energy-spill/husky-oil-spill-in-canadian-river-caused-by-ground-movement-idUSL1N1DI2FD
17,KMI,"RPT-Canada pipeline opponents ready to take on Kinder Morgan, Ottawa"," VANCOUVER (Reuters) - If Canada approves Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, the company’s four-year campaign for the project will be far from over. Next up is a battle against hardening opposition amongst some communities along its planned route.  The C$6.8 billion ($5.04 billion) project is a big step toward opening up Asian markets to supply from Canada’s massive oil sands. Kinder Morgan plans to build a pipeline parallel to an existing line and nearly triple capacity on the artery to 890,000 barrels per day.  Without the expansion, Canadian oil sands producers may find it too costly to ship crude by rail, missing out on billions of dollars of export revenue.  First, the crude must travel from the conservative heart of the Canadian oil industry in Alberta across mountains and grasslands to the liberal West Coast. The further west on the route, the stiffer the resistance to the plan.  The pipeline ends at Burnaby, part of Vancouver’s urban sprawl, which already hosts fuel tanks and the marine terminal for the existing pipeline, as well as a refinery. In opposition to further development thousands have taken to the streets vowing to block bulldozers if Trans Mountain construction goes ahead.  Ottawa has until Dec. 19 to decide whether to approve it, but the decision could come as soon as this week.  Burnaby mayor Derek Corrigan said he would join the protests even if could end his political career.  “It’s not nice to be a politician who has been 15 years in this office, to be heading into the end of my career with something that would show civil disobedience,” Corrigan, 65, told Reuters. “I lose sleep about whether or not this is going to turn into being something ugly.”  The backlash against a plan to build on sites already dedicated to energy infrastructure shows how entrenched opposition to new energy projects in North America has become.  It also shows how the government is struggling to soothe public concerns despite its pledge to give local communities greater say in the approval process. Pipeline opponents - British Columbia municipalities, aboriginal groups and environmentalists - are fighting the expansion for reasons ranging from climate change concerns to fears of tanker spills, pipeline leaks or tank farm fires.  They draw inspiration from the fate of Enbridge’s stalled Northern Gateway pipeline, TransCanada’s rejected Keystone XL and protests against the Dakota Access pipeline built in the United States by Energy Transfer Partners.  “Simply because the government will issue a grandiose statement of approval does not mean the project will ever see the light of day,” Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of BC Chiefs, an aboriginal organization, told Reuters in on the eve of a 3,000-strong anti-Trans Mountain rally in Vancouver’s center.  In an emailed response to Reuters, the project’s media team cited Kinder Morgan’s strong safety record in the area, but said it had not expected consensus on the project given a wide range of interests and opinions. It noted that the Canadian energy regulator had approved the new pipeline with 157 “rigorous, but achievable” conditions that address environmental and safety concerns that Kinder Morgan is committed to meet.  The pipeline starts from a 140-acre (0.57 square km) tank farm outside of Edmonton where, like elsewhere in Alberta, new export pipelines enjoy public support as a way to revive the oil province’s stuttering economy.  About 800 kilometers (497 miles) west in Kamloops, a south central British Columbia city that unlike most of the province voted Conservative in the 2015 federal election, the local businesses and the mayor also back the pipeline.  “Communities along the interior route have a familiarity with resource-based projects and what they bring,” Kinder Morgan Canada President Ian Anderson said at a Kamloops Chamber of Commerce event this month.  But further west, the sentiment turns against the pipeline. Earlier this month Liberal lawmaker Ron McKinnon urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to reject the expansion because of “overwhelming” opposition on the west coast, where his party did unexpectedly well in the last election.  A recent poll commissioned by one of environmental groups found nearly a third of British Columbia’s Liberal voters said they would be less likely to support the party if Trans Mountain goes ahead.  From Kamloops the pipeline climbs over the steep Coquihalla Pass, which separates interior British Columbia from the Fraser Valley and the coast. As the vegetation turns from semi-arid scrublands to temperate rainforest and the route enters the fertile farming region, opposition intensifies.  “I know five grandmothers who will go and lie down in front of bulldozers...and I will absolutely join them,” said Michael Hale, 72, a co-founder of Yarrow Eco Village near Chilliwack, a 20-acre farm under which the existing pipeline runs.  “They may bring in the army, they may throw me in jail, but when I get out I will come back,” he said.  The pipeline ends at Burnaby Mountain tank farm near the Westridge marine terminal, which Kinder Morgan aims to expand to load 34 oil tankers a month from five now.  Burnaby deputy fire chief Chris Bowcock says the planned increase in the number of oil storage tanks on Burnaby Mountain from 13 to 27 would raise the risk of a single tank fire spreading across the complex.  Opponents, among them Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson, also fear a potential oil spill would cripple the local economy powered by the Port of Vancouver, tourism, and increasingly, the film industry.  Kinder Morgan says it is investing in extra safeguards to mitigate the probability of a tanker spill but opponents say the risk to the rugged coastline is too great.  “Our first mother is the water,” said Reuben George of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation, whose lands face Westridge dock. “We will do anything to protect it and we will not let the pipeline go through.”  The aboriginal group is planning litigation if the government approves the project.  In June, two conservation groups filed a lawsuit challenging the energy regulator’s positive recommendation saying the oil tankers’ route cut across a habitat of an 80-strong pod of killer whales protected under Canada’s Species at Risk Act.  If legal action fails, Trans Mountain’s opponents say they will resort to civil disobedience. This month in Vancouver environmental groups gave free training on mass protests, blockades, and de-escalating confrontations with police.  Asked how Kinder Morgan might respond, Anderson told reporters in Kamloops the company was prepared to talk to all who had a view about the project.  “We’ll see what unfolds and hopefully we can get through this period in a respectful way.”  ",11282016,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-pipeline-transmountain/rpt-canada-pipeline-opponents-ready-to-take-on-kinder-morgan-ottawa-idUSL1N1DT01Q

20,KMI,Environmentalists file suit over Kinder Morgan pipeline in Canada,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Two environmental groups on Tuesday filed for a judicial review of the Canadian government’s decision to approve Kinder Morgan’s (KMI.N) Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, the first legal challenge to the project since it received the green light last month. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Cabinet on Nov. 29 approved trebling capacity on the pipeline, which ships oil sands crude from Alberta to the Port of Vancouver, British Columbia, despite fierce opposition from environmental and aboriginal groups. Ecojustice, the law firm representing environmental groups Living Oceans Society and Raincoast Conservation Foundation, said the expanded pipeline and an increase in oil tanker traffic will be a “death knell” for a pod of endangered Southern Resident killer whales off the coast of British Columbia. Dyna Tuytel, a lawyer for Ecojustice, said the basis for the lawsuit is that the killer whales are covered by Canada’s Species at Risk Act, meaning the government is legally required to protect them. “The ships’ noise interferes with their ability to communicate and there is increased risk of pollution from major spills and smaller ones,” Tuytel said. Ecojustice had filed one lawsuit on behalf of its two clients against Trans Mountain in the summer, also citing risks to the killer whales. That suit challenged the National Energy Board’s review of the project, which recommended the government approve it. Tuytel said that initial case was ongoing, but the court may combine the two lawsuits and hear them together. There are around another six legal challenges against the NEB review of Trans Mountain ongoing, filed by municipalities and First Nations on the pipeline route. Tuytel said it was likely those groups would launch fresh legal action against the Canadian government decision.  The lawsuit was filed against the Cabinet, citing the attorney general of Canada. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to request for comment.

21,KMI,Kinder Morgan wins dismissal of $171 million investor lawsuit,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The Delaware Supreme Court dismissed on Tuesday a $171 million investor lawsuit against Kinder Morgan Inc stemming from the pipeline operator’s acquisition of El Paso Corp and its affiliates. The lower Court of Chancery ruled last year that Kinder Morgan was on the hook for the bulk of the damages owed to investors in a master limited partnership, or MLP, which was shortchanged in deals with its own parent, El Paso Corp. Kinder Morgan had argued it was being held liable over deals it was not involved in, except that it ended up acquiring both the buyer and seller in the transactions at the center of the lawsuit.  The Delaware Supreme Court agreed, and said if it allowed the damage award to stand “useful transactions would be deterred or priced at a lower value because third-party acquirers would find themselves having bought into litigation morasses.”  Jeffrey Squire, an attorney who represented the plaintiff, declined to comment. A Kinder Morgan spokesman was not immediately available for comment. The dismissed lawsuit began with deals in 2011 in which El Paso Pipeline Partners, an MLP, bought subsidiaries of its parent company, El Paso Corp. Peter Brinckerhoff, an investor in the MLP, sued in 2011 and argued the MLP was coerced into overpaying.  Vice Chancellor Travis Laster found that the committee that governed the MLP and the committee’s advisers acted in bad faith in approving the deal. Brinckerhoff’s lawsuit was a derivative action, meaning he brought it not on behalf of himself and other MLP investors, but on behalf of the MLP itself.  Kinder Morgan bought the MLP during the litigation, and the pipeline operator reasoned that in doing so it also acquired the litigation, rendering the case moot. The Supreme Court said Brinckerhoff could have challenged the price Kinder Morgan paid for the MLP to better reflect the value of his lawsuit, but noted he chose not to.

22,KMI,British Columbia approves Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - British Columbia on Wednesday gave the green light to Kinder Morgan Inc’s plan to nearly triple its Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which runs from Canada’s oil sands through the province to a marine terminal on the Pacific Coast. British Columbia Premier Christy Clark said in a statement the C$6.8 billion ($5.16 billion) project had satisfied or was close to satisfying the five conditions she laid out in 2012 for any company wanting to build pipelines in the province. The Canadian government in November approved Kinder Morgan’s proposal to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline, which would help ensure oil exports from the oil sands in the neighboring province of Alberta reach Asia. Although inter-provincial pipelines fall under federal jurisdiction, if provinces are opposed they could impose conditions that would make it onerous for a company to build a pipeline. Environmental groups were swift to condemn the Western Canadian province’s decision to approve the project, which comes four months before a provincial election. “We expect that today’s decision on the Kinder Morgan pipeline will come back to haunt Premier Clark when B.C. voters go to the polls,” Sven Biggs of Stand.earth said. “British Columbians will continue to fight this decision in the courts and on the streets well past next spring’s election,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday, the province had given its approval to an environmental review of the project but recommended 37 conditions be attached to address concerns raised by communities and aboriginal groups. With the environmental approval, only two more approvals were outstanding on Trans Mountain: the province getting a “fair share” of jobs and economic benefits from the pipeline and a marine response plan to oil spills. On getting its fair share, Clark said the province had struck an “unprecedented” agreement with Kinder Morgan under which the company would pay it up to C$1 billion in installments of between C$25 million and C$50 million a year over 20 years.  The province was working closely with the Canadian government to have a “world-leading” marine spill response plan in place before the pipeline starts operations, which could be as early as December 2019, Clark said.   Kinder Morgan welcomed the province’s approval. The Texas-based company’s board now has to make a final investment decision on the project. Construction is slated to start in September.

24,KMI,Pipeline company Kinder Morgan's revenue misses estimates,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue for the ninth straight quarter as its pipelines transported lower volumes of oil and gas. Pipeline companies, once seen as insulated from commodity price swings due to fixed-fee contracts, were hit hard by a more than 60 percent slump in oil prices since mid-2014 as cash-strapped oil and gas companies renegotiated contracts. Kinder Morgan said natural gas transport volumes fell 2 percent in the quarter, however it expects future natural gas infrastructure to grow due to higher demand from gas-fired power generators, exports to Mexico and growth in the U.S. petrochemical industry. The company reported a net profit attributable to shareholders of $170 million, or 8 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $721 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. Kinder Morgan said it paid $988 million lesser in charges in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. The year-ago quarter included a $1.15 billion impairment charge. According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the company earned 18 cents per share on an adjusted basis, in line with analysts’ average estimate.

25,KMI,UPDATE 2-Pipeline company Kinder Morgan's revenue misses estimates,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue for the ninth straight quarter as its pipelines transported lower volumes of oil and gas. Pipeline companies, once seen as insulated from commodity price swings due to fixed-fee contracts, were hit hard by a more than 60 percent slump in oil prices since mid-2014 as cash-strapped oil and gas companies renegotiated contracts. Kinder Morgan said natural gas transport volumes fell 2 percent in the quarter, however it expects future natural gas infrastructure to grow due to higher demand from gas-fired power generators, exports to Mexico and growth in the U.S. petrochemical industry. The company reported a net profit attributable to shareholders of $170 million, or 8 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $721 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. Kinder Morgan said it paid $988 million lesser in charges in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. The year-ago quarter included a $1.15 billion impairment charge. According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the company earned 18 cents per share on an adjusted basis, in line with analysts’ average estimate. Revenue fell to $3.39 billion from $3.64 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $3.54 billion.

28,KMI,U.S. regulator to probe Kinder Morgan natural gas pipeline rates,"(Reuters) - U.S. federal energy regulators said Thursday they would investigate rates charged by two natural gas pipelines operated by Kinder Morgan Inc to determine if they may be over-recovering costs, resulting in unjust and unreasonable rates. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said it reviewed cost and revenue information provided by the Natural Gas Co of America (NGPL) and the Wyoming Interstate Co pipelines in their publicly available annual reports for 2014 and 2015. In response to the FERC investigation, Tom Martin, president of Kinder Morgan Natural Gas Pipelines, said in a statement, “The FERC has chosen to interject itself in an unwarranted and unfair manner in the productive relationships between the companies and their customers.” “FERC is launching this effort based on stale data in a rapidly evolving environment, and without a full understanding of the facts and the changing market conditions faced by the pipelines that could have been gained through engagement with the companies prior to taking any action,” Martin said. Based on its review of the data, FERC said it estimates NGPL’s return on equity for those calendar years to be 28.5 percent and 20.8 percent, respectively. However, Kinder Morgan disputed FERC’s calculation and said the return on equity for its NGPL unit was 17.7 percent in 2014 and 15.7 percent in 2015. FERC was not immediately available for additional comment. The commission said it estimated Wyoming Interstate’s return on equity for those calendar years to be 17.7 percent and 19.0 percent, respectively. Based on these figures, FERC said it was concerned that both pipelines’ earnings may exceed their actual cost of service, including a reasonable return on equity. FERC directed each pipeline to file a cost and revenue study for the latest available 12-month period within 75 days. The commission also said it set each case for evidentiary hearings before a FERC administrative law judge. Kinder Morgan said it would review the FERC orders and reply in accordance with procedural requirements, noting “they fully expect the evidence to show that the rates charged by (the pipelines) have been and continue to be just and reasonable.” NGPL, jointly owned by Kinder Morgan and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP, is one of the largest interstate systems in the country with about 9,200 miles (14,805 kilometers) of pipeline.

31,KMI,"Kinder Morgan gas pipeline explodes in Texas, no injuries","(Reuters) - A Kinder Morgan Inc natural gas pipeline exploded early on Wednesday in southern Texas, the company said, and a television reported homes up to 60 miles (96 km) away were shaken by the blast. The fuel terminal operator said no injuries were reported and it had put out the fire on its Tejas pipeline in a rural area of Refugio, Texas, about 45 miles (72 km) north of Corpus Christi. The fire was discovered at about 12:30 a.m. CST (0630 GMT) and led to a shutdown of part of the pipeline. Kinder Morgan said in a statement the impact on customers was being assessed. The cause of the leak is under investigation. The company sent personnel to the scene and regulators were notified, it said. Houston’s KHOU television station said that in addition to shaking homes within 60 miles, the glow from the flames after the blast could be seen from 175 miles (281 km) away. Residents “say that they thought it was an earthquake, others described it as a thunder roll that wouldn’t end,” a  reporter for the CBS affiliate said from the scene. A spokeswoman for the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the energy industry in the state, could not immediately be reached for comment.

32,KMI,Exclusive: Kinder Morgan starts talks with investors for $5.2 billion Canada pipeline project - sources,"TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) has begun talks with institutional investors including major Canadian pension funds and private equity firms to raise capital for the C$6.8 billion ($5.2 billion) expansion of its Trans Mountain pipeline project, according to people familiar with the process. Kinder Morgan has held discussions with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, three of the biggest Canadian pension funds, the people added. It was unclear whether these talks were continuing. The biggest U.S. pipeline company, which has said its goals for 2017 include a joint venture or initial public offering of Trans Mountain, is stepping up financing efforts even though the massive project faces opposition from environmental and aboriginal groups. It won Canadian government approval late last year, and expects to start the expansion later in 2017 and complete it by 2019. Kinder Morgan has hired Toronto Dominion Bank (TD.TO) as an adviser to help arrange financing, and the bank is expected to run a so-called “dual-track” process. Apart from a potential IPO, Kinder Morgan is also considering sale of a 50 percent stake in Trans Mountain by creating a joint venture. The formal process to attract venture partners is getting underway, the people said. “We’re confident in the interest from the investment community and we’re continuing to move forward with all aspects of planning in order to begin construction in September 2017,” said Ali Hounsell, spokeswoman for Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion Project.   The company will also tap sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East, the people said. Institutional investors are attracted to infrastructure assets because they tend to operate with long-term contracts and have stable cash flow. CPPIB declined to comment. TD, the Caisse and Ontario Teachers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sources declined to be identified as the discussions are private. Should Kinder Morgan pursue a share sale instead, it would be among the biggest IPOs in Canadian history. An IPO could raise about 20 to 40 percent of the targeted budget, one of the people said, or between C$1.4 billion and C$2.7 billion. The IPO could be a spin-off of its Trans Mountain pipeline business or the rest of its Canadian assets, which sources said would be more likely. Trans Mountain has been operating since 1953. Most of the crude, which is produced in Alberta, is shipped to British Columbia’s Pacific Coast, with some volumes diverted south of the border to Washington State.     Kinder Morgan has owned the pipeline since 2005 when it bought Terasen Inc. The expansion project will make Trans Mountain one of the biggest pipelines in North America. For the company, it would almost triple the pipeline’s capacity, allowing it to transport 890,000 barrels of oil per day.  The Trans Mountain expansion would increase access to fast-growing Asian refining markets and has strong support from Canadian oil sands shippers keen to diversify their customer base away from just the United States.     But it faces strong opposition from environmentalists and communities along its route, with critics from First Nations chiefs to the mayor of Burnaby, where it terminates, vowing civil disobedience to disrupt construction. (reut.rs/2kDsWwh) Kinder Morgan Canada President Ian Anderson said last year he would be “naive” not to expect blockades during the build.     The current Trans Mountain pipeline is routinely oversubscribed, with shippers keen to transport crude to Canada’s Pacific coast usually only able to move a fraction of their nominated volumes.     The scarcity of such high-quality infrastructure assets makes them particularly attractive, often increasing competition among institutional players. Canada’s growing pension funds have been forced to look beyond Canada for large acquisitions.     Frustration has been growing in the energy industry about Canadian pipelines struggling to get approved. The Trans Mountain expansion project was one of few to get a go-ahead in recent years, along with Enbridge Inc’s (ENB.TO) Line 3 replacement project.

34,KMI,"UPDATE 2-Kinder Morgan raises Canada's Trans Mountain cost, commitments drop","(Adds details) March 9 (Reuters) - Shipper commitment for Kinder Morgan Inc’s Canadian Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project dipped by 3 percent, or 22,000 barrels per day, after the company raised its cost estimate to C$7.4 billion ($5.48 billion) and increased tolls, the company said on Thursday. The current Trans Mountain pipeline between the oil-producing province of Alberta and the west coast is routinely oversubscribed, and the expansion has had strong support from Canadian oil sands shippers. But it also faces strong opposition from environmentalists and communities along its route, with critics from First Nations chiefs to the mayor of Burnaby, where it terminates, vowing civil disobedience to disrupt construction. In a statement, Kinder Morgan said the tolls increased in part because of conditions imposed by the National Energy Board regulator and project changes as a result of public feedback such as thicker pipe walls. It did not say how much the tolls rose, but it said last month the project’s cost was then estimated at C$6.8 billion. The 3 percent of capacity that was turned back will be offered to the industry again starting Thursday via an “open season” process, the company said. In November the Canadian government approved Kinder Morgan’s plan to nearly triple its crude pipeline to 890,000 barrels per day. Since receiving the final cost estimate and revised tolls, some existing and prospective shippers traded capacity among themselves, resulting in the 3 percent drop, the company said. The remaining 97 percent of Trans Mountain capacity are under contract with existing or new shippers, and the company maintains “strong” commercial support for the project, Kinder Morgan said. The biggest U.S. pipeline company said next steps for the project include arranging financing and a final investment decision. People familiar with the process told Reuters last month that Kinder Morgan had begun talks with institutional investors including major Canadian pension funds and private equity firms.

46,KMI,Kinder Morgan to raise up to $1.3 billion in Canadian IPO,"TORONTO (Reuters) - U.S. pipeline Kinder Morgan Inc’s (KMI.N) Canadian unit is seeking to raise up to C$1.75 billion ($1.3 billion) in an initial public offering (IPO) in Toronto, Kinder Morgan Canada said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. If successful, the deal would be one of Canada’s top five IPOs and help fund the expansion of Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline. Kinder Morgan expects the expansion project to cost about C$7.4 billion.  It comes as the Liberal Party, the only one that backs the project, failed to clinch a majority in an election on Tuesday in the British Columbia province, through which the pipe runs.  The party, unaffiliated with the governing federal Liberals, now has to woo another party to form the provincial government of British Columbia, raising questions about the project’s future.  Kinder Morgan Canada, however, said it remains confident of the project. President Ian Anderson said in a statement, “We look forward to the opportunity to provide updates on the status of the project and its benefits to B.C.”   The company plans to offer between 79.5 million and 92.1 million restricted voting shares, at C$19 to C$21 per share, it said in the filing. Toronto Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) are the lead underwriters for the IPO.

An election this month in the Canadian province of British Columbia, through which Trans Mountain passes, has resulted in the environmentalist Green Party holding the balance of power, threatening the expansion even though it has federal approval. That has complicated the initial public offering (IPO) for Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd, whose purpose was to fund the expansion.

Official recount results on Wednesday from the closely contested May 9 election confirmed that the pro-Trans Mountain ruling British Columbia Liberal Party lost its legislative majority. That forces it to woo the Greens to govern, potentially making concessions. In the worst scenario for the Liberals, the Greens could form their own majority government with the second-place New Democrats, who also oppose Trans Mountain.

61,KMI,Kinder Morgan Canada shares drop on debut after $1.3 bln IPO,"TORONTO/ALBERTA, May 30, (Reuters) - Shares in Kinder Morgan Canadian debuted at C$16.06 on Tuesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange after raising C$1.75 billion ($1.3 billion) in an initial public offering (IP0) at C$17.00 each last week. Kinder Morgan spun off its Canadian unit to part-finance the expansion of Trans Mountain pipeline, but political opposition to the project is set to mount after an election this month in the province of British Columbia, through which the pipeline runs, resulted in an informal alliance of two anti-Trans Mountain parties rising to power. Kinder Morgan’s C$17 per-share target was a revision from its original projected range of C$19 to C$22. The company has acknowledged “the political climate was not ideal,” but said it has made a final investment decision on Trans Mountain and filed for an IPO anyway as the project’s financing contingency period concludes at the end of May. The Trans Mountain expansion nearly triples the capacity of the crude pipeline from the oil-producing Alberta province to the British Columbia coast. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the Trans Mountain pipeline will proceed despite the political threat to kill the project in British Columbia. “Regardless of the change in government in British Columbia or anywhere else, the facts and evidence do not change,” Trudeau told reporters at a joint news conference with his Italian counterpart in Rome, The Globe and Mail reported on Tuesday. By 9:33 AM EST, the shares were trading at C$16.00, down 5.9 percent from the IPO price.

62,KMI,Kinder Morgan Canada says pipeline facing obstacle has 'met every test',"CALGARY, Alberta, May 31 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion has “met every test” in its bid to attain approval, the company said on Wednesday, responding to a vow by the British Columbia province’s de facto incoming government to block the project. The expansion of the pipeline that transits British Columbia has obtained both federal and regulatory approval and has passed an environmental assessment under the province’s incumbent Liberals. “Trans Mountain has followed every process and met every test put before us,” Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd President Ian Anderson said in his first public comment after British Columbia’s Green and New Democratic parties said on Tuesday they would use “every tool” against the project. “Over many years, our project has been reviewed, analyzed, discussed and considered thoroughly,” Anderson said in a statement. The company is starting to award “significant” contracts and is moving ahead with benefit agreements, he said. The Trans Mountain expansion almost triples the capacity of the existing pipeline, which is designed to carry crude from Canada’s oil sands to the West Coast. Canada’s oil producers, who lack export routes, say it helps them to attain better prices. The expansion has the backing of British Columbia’s Liberal Party, which lost its legislative majority in a May 9 election. The opposition Greens and New Democrats have sealed a deal to unseat the Liberals and said on Tuesday they would be consulting provincial bureaucrats on permitting for the expansion. While there is some dispute over whether British Columbia has a formal right to a veto, the province can raise hurdles that could effectively make the pipeline impossible to build. Prolonged battles over Trans Mountain and other crude pipelines have raised questions over the viability of new energy projects in British Columbia.

64,KMI,Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain to see little major work this year,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Little major construction will happen on Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion this year although construction remains on schedule to begin in September, company President Ian Anderson said on Wednesday. Trans Mountain’s fate had grown more uncertain since last month’s rise of a new provincial government in Canada’s British Columbia that is against the line’s expansion through the province.   Most work on the expansion this year will be preparations for major construction in 2018, Anderson said on a conference call with analysts, when asked whether the company has included slack in the timeline to accommodate uncertainties.  “That was always the plan,” he said. “Permit acquisition and the priority of permitting activities is built around that.” Anderson declined to speculate on what the new government would do but said the company still needs “a good number” of local permits. He said he looked forward to meeting with British Columbia’s new Premier John Horgan. The company posted slightly lower-than-expected quarterly profits on Wednesday. It was its first earnings report after being spun off from Houston’s Kinder Morgan Inc, a move made in part to finance the Trans Mountain expansion. The expansion almost triples the capacity of the existing pipeline, designed to carry crude from Canada’s oil sands to the West Coast.  While the province cannot override Trans Mountain’s federal approval, it can raise obstacles for the project, delaying it and wearing down the will of Kinder Morgan’s investors, experts have said. Anderson said Kinder Morgan has made its first order for steel for the Trans Mountain expansion and will finalize construction contracts by mid-August. The company still has C$6.1 billion to spend on the C$7.4-billion project, the bulk of which would be labor costs that would be mostly incurred in 2018 and 2019, Anderson said. The company said it expects the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to be on schedule to be in service by the end of 2019.  Kinder Morgan Canada reported net income of C$25.1 million ($19.9 million), or 11 Canadian cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, below analysts’ average estimate of 14 Canadian cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

72,KMI,Canada band raises new issue in Kinder Morgan pipeline challenge,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - A Canadian aboriginal band seeking to stop Kinder Morgan Inc’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion has asked a court to consider the federal government’s position for a tougher review on a rival project. The west coast Tsleil-Waututh Nation made the request in a letter to the Federal Court of Appeal seen by Reuters this week. The request came after Canada’s resource regulator announced a tougher upcoming review for TransCanada Corp’s Energy East pipeline last week, but the request cites the federal government’s May recommendation for that review.  The request was part of a legal challenge that, if successful, would quash the federal approval for the C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) Trans Mountain project and cause lengthy delays. Kinder Morgan and the federal government, which approved Trans Mountain last year, opposed Tsleil-Waututh’s motion in submissions on Monday, telling the court separately Canada’s opinion on Energy East was “irrelevant” to Trans Mountain. The Natural Resources Canada federal agency said in a statement on Tuesday: “We recognize that not everyone agrees with the decision made by the government, but we remain committed to working with provinces, territories and indigenous peoples.” Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd, the local division of Houston’s Kinder Morgan Inc, declined to comment. The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple the capacity of the existing pipeline from Canada’s oil heartland of Alberta to the west coast and significantly increase crude tanker traffic. Canadian crude producers, whose landlocked product trades at a discount to the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, say they need more pipeline capacity to fetch better prices, but efforts to attain that have come under fierce opposition from environmental and aboriginal groups.  Tsleil-Waututh is among more than two dozen parties in a consolidated legal challenge against Trans Mountain that is expected to be heard in October. A judge on Tuesday allowed the province of British Columbia, which opposes the expansion that passes through it, to join the challenge.  Tsleil-Waututh argues in part that Trans Mountain’s regulatory assessment was improperly done because it did not consider the expansion’s effect on marine shipping. Canada continues to argue against the need for such consideration for Trans Mountain, but in its recommendation for the Energy East review, did the opposite “without any explanation,” lawyer Scott Smith, who represents the band, told Reuters. “That is not honorable,” he added.

77,KMI,Canada's Desjardins mulls withdrawal from Kinder pipeline expansion,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canadian lender Desjardins is considering backing out of its C$145 million ($113 million) commitment to Kinder Morgan Inc’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, two people present at a meeting with the financial institution told Reuters. At the meeting last Thursday, Desjardins senior executives told aboriginal leaders the lender will consider their request to pull its financing for the C$7.4 billion ($6.1 billion) project, said Eugene Kung, a lawyer for the west coast Tsleil-Waututh Nation, who was at the event. Desjardins is a minor lender for the project, but a potential pull back would go beyond an announcement in July when it temporarily suspended lending for future oil pipelines. Desjardins, the largest association of credit unions in North America, said it may make the decision permanent this month, citing concerns about the impact pipelines may have on the environment. Desjardins spokesman André Chapleau said in a statement the financial institution’s “positioning on this issue has not yet been completed.” “We are listening to various stakeholders, internally and externally, and we do not intend to make our exchanges public in all due respect to our stakeholders,” Chapleau said. Ali Hounsell, a spokeswoman for the Trans Mountain project said: “The commitment from Desjardins is closed, and from our perspective firm and final.”  “They could choose to sell their commitment to another financial institution, but it would have no impact to the size of our credit facilities,” she said. The expansion by Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd, a division of Houston’s Kinder Morgan Inc, is already facing opposition from environmental and aboriginal groups and the government of the British Columbia province, through which the pipeline passes. The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple the capacity of the existing pipeline from Canada’s oil heartland of Alberta to the west coast. Canadian producers, whose landlocked product trades at a discount to the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, say they need more export capacity to fetch better prices.

80,KMI,Kinder Morgan says fish-mat ban may delay Canada pipe expansion,"CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion may be delayed if the country’s energy regulator continues to bar it from installing anti-fish-spawning mats in construction areas, the company said late on Thursday. The remarks, in a letter to the National Energy Board, mark a departure from the company’s long-standing public stance that the project remained on track despite mounting opposition and regulatory hurdles. While Kinder Morgan outlined political and regulatory risks to its expansion in a prospectus for the public offering of its Canadian unit in May, the company described them as “standard” language. In Thursday’s letter, a Kinder Morgan lawyer asked for relief from an order last week that the company stop installing such mats - work that the regulator said had “not yet been authorized.” The mats would prevent fish from being harmed by construction activity and were “key” to starting work. If relief was not granted, some “installations may be delayed for a year, which would delay construction of the corresponding crossing by a full year, potentially impacting the project in-service date,” the lawyer wrote. The company did not say how far beyond the late 2019 date its plan to start shipping oil on the expanded line could be delayed. The NEB and Kinder Morgan Canada, a unit of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The expansion project aims to nearly triple the capacity of the existing pipeline from Canada’s oil heartland of Alberta to the west coast. The project faces opposition from environmental and aboriginal groups and the provincial government of British Columbia, through which the pipeline passes, though it has the backing of the energy sector.

82,KMI,Kinder Morgan's revenue beats as natgas volumes rise,"(Reuters) - Pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc’s (KMI.N) quarterly revenue edged past analysts’ estimates as a rise in natural gas volumes helped offset the impact of Hurricane Harvey and loss of revenue from the divestiture of its Canadian assets. The company’s shares were up 1.3 percent at $18.93 in extended trading on Wednesday. Revenue was weighed down by the separation of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd (KML.TO) in May and a partial shut down of some of its pipelines and gas storage facilities due to Hurricane Harvey, the company said. However, natural gas transport volumes rose 3 percent, driven by the company’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipelines. Hurricane Harvey, which hit the Texas shore in August, reduced natural gas gathering volumes by 14 percent and crude and condensate pipeline volumes by 8 percent, the company said. Kinder Morgan said Harvey will have about $20 million impact on 2017 distributable cash, excluding repair costs.  The Houston-based company said it expects all repair costs to be covered by its insurance. Net income available to shareholders was $334 million, or 15 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $227 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Kinder Morgan’s revenue fell 1.5 percent to $3.28 billion, but beat analysts’ average estimate of $3.25 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

86,KMI,"Canada's Burnaby, B.C., hits back at Kinder Morgan in pipeline dispute","Oct 27 (Reuters) - The city of Burnaby, British Columbia, accused Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd of disrespecting municipal regulations on Friday, after the company appealed to Canada’s energy regulator for approval to start work on its Trans Mountain oil pipeline. The company, a unit of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc , on Thursday asked the National Energy Board for approval to start some construction work in Burnaby as it has been unable to obtain the necessary permits from the city. Kinder Morgan said delays were costing it millions of dollars every month and the city was failing to act in a “timely manner.” The Trans Mountain expansion would triple capacity on the existing pipeline from the oil-rich province of Alberta to the British Columbia coast to 890,000 barrels per day, and was approved by the federal government last year despite fierce opposition from environmentalists, aboriginal groups and some municipalities. Canada’s oil industry says it needs the expanded pipeline capacity to open up export markets in Asia and boost the price of its landlocked crude. Officials from the City of Burnaby, home to the marine terminal and tank farm where the pipeline terminates, rebuked Kinder Morgan for appealing to the regulator. “Because of the size and scope of Kinder Morgan’s project, these approvals take time,” city manager Lambert Chu said in a statement. “For several months city staff have worked diligently and have also met regularly with company representatives in the process as directed by the NEB. Now the company seems to want more.” Kinder Morgan declined to comment on the City of Burnaby’s statements. NEB spokesman James Stevenson said the regulator had received the company’s request and would set out a process for reviewing it. Mayor Derek Corrigan said Kinder Morgan President Ian Anderson came to his office on Wednesday to complain about the permitting process. Corrigan is a vocal opponent of the pipeline project and has pledged civil disobedience to help disrupt construction. He said on Friday he has no influence on the speed of the municipal regulatory process. “The city remains opposed to Kinder Morgan’s pipeline project and council will continue to pursue every legal option to oppose the project,” Corrigan said in a statement. “We will not, however, interfere with processes that Kinder Morgan has a right to pursue, including requests for city permits.” (Reporting by Nia Williams and Ethan Lou in Calgary, Alberta; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",10272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-kinder-morgan-cn-pipeline/canadas-burnaby-b-c-hits-back-at-kinder-morgan-in-pipeline-dispute-idUSL2N1N226X

88,KMI,Kinder Morgan warns pipeline expansion could be further delayed,"VANCOUVER/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd said on Monday the start-up of its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion could be delayed past September 2020 if it is unable to get more clarity around permitting and the judicial process by early next year. The company’s appeal to Canada’s energy regulator over municipal permits for the C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) expansion was heard on Monday. The company said in a statement that it needs certainty by early 2018 to move ahead with construction. “Unfortunately, the scope and pace of the permits and approvals received does not allow for significant additional construction to begin at this time,” Kinder Morgan Canada Chief Executive Steve Kean said in the statement. The expansion of the pipeline from Alberta’s energy heartland to a port near Vancouver would nearly triple capacity to 890,000 barrels per day. The company had previously said that completion of the expansion could be pushed back by nine months, from December 2019 to September 2020, due to the permitting issues. It said it hoped to mitigate the delays by speeding up work in certain areas. The unit of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc also said it had earmarked C$1.8 billion for spending on the project in 2018, but noted that further construction delays would lead to reduced 2018 spending. It said it planned to spend the first part of the year advancing the permitting process. The company wants Canada’s energy regulator, the National Energy Board, to resolve permitting issues with the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby and set up a process for addressing future local permit delays. Lawyers for both sides made closing arguments on Monday before the regulator in Canada’s oil capital of Calgary, Alberta. The quasi-judicial body has reserved judgment.   Maureen Killoran, representing Kinder Morgan, said Burnaby civil servants had been vague about the timelines for permit assessments and that the process had been tainted by the city’s mayor, who publicly opposes it. Burnaby lawyer Greg McDade said city officials were simply doing their jobs and treated Kinder Morgan impartially, and that any delay was caused by the company’s poorly prepared applications. Kinder Morgan has said each month of delay directly costs the company up to C$35 million and deprives it of more than C$90 million in revenue. The company on Monday did not provide an update on the project’s estimated price tag due to what it said was continued uncertainty.

90,KMI,Kinder Morgan gas pipeline explosion kills 2 in Illinois: fire dept,"(Reuters) - An explosion on a Kinder Morgan natural gas pipeline  killed two people and injured two others on Tuesday in Lee County, Illinois, according to the Dixon Rural fire department chief. Kinder Morgan said a suspected third party line strike could have caused a natural gas release on a 20-inch lateral segment of its Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America’s (NGPL) system in Lee County at about 9:35 a.m. central time. “The impacted pipeline has been isolated and the area has been secured with local road closures,” the company said.  Earlier, local media reported Kinder Morgan shut a natural gas pipeline due to an explosion in Northern Illinois after it was struck by farming equipment. NGPL, which transports natural gas into the Chicago market, has about 9,200 miles of pipeline, and 288 billion cubic feet of working gas storage, according to a company website.

93,KMI,UPDATE 1-Canada regulator sets out process for pipeline permit disputes,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The National Energy Board on Thursday set out a process for resolving permit disputes related to Kinder Morgan Canada’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which has faced repeated delays due to difficulty in obtaining permits. The regulator said that under the new process it will consider future disputes between the company and provincial and municipal authorities, and provide a response within three to five weeks, providing a “measure of certainty” for all parties. The announcement came a day after Kinder Morgan Canada, a division of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc, said the start-up of the expanded pipeline would be delayed until December 2020 due to permitting struggles. Kinder Morgan said late on Thursday it was pleased with the NEB’s decision, adding it was committed to work with local authorities and would review the decision in more detail. The Trans Mountain expansion, which would nearly triple capacity to 890,000 barrels per day, is hotly opposed by environmental groups, the province of British Columbia, and some local municipalities, including the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, where the pipeline ends. While the project has federal approvals, Burnaby last year refused to issue key construction permits, forcing Kinder Morgan to appeal to the NEB for permission to proceed with its work. The company won that appeal in December.    The NEB said it hopes the new process, which was requested by Kinder Morgan, will be used sparingly and that all participants will approach future permitting on a good faith basis, noting that the company must comply with all local laws.   Separately, the NEB said it will hold hearings in Burnaby starting next week on the final route of the expansion, which is a twinning of an existing line from Alberta’s energy heartland to the British Columbia coast.

99,KMI,"CORRECTED-RPT-NuStar, other energy partnerships simplify business models to spur growth","(Corrects title of Kayne Anderson executive in 11th paragraph) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Some publicly-traded U.S. energy pipeline and oil-storage partnerships are restructuring into simpler business models to help attract new investors and spur growth. Rising oil and gas production has spawned billions of dollars of new transport, gathering and storage projects. But the companies most responsible for these projects can allocate up to 50 percent of their income to the general partner, leaving less for other holders or to invest in new projects. Historically, these firms have passed most of their income along to holders and sold equity or debt to finance new projects or acquisitions. But in the last year, what they have had to offer investors has jumped. MPLX Energy Logistics LP, for instance, paid a 9.7 percent annualized distribution last quarter to its holders, up from 7.9 percent a year earlier, according to figures from investment firm East Daley Capital Advisors. “The higher cash yield makes the economics of these projects a little tougher,” said Kendrick Rhea, an analyst at East Daley Capital. He estimates the cost of equity has risen nearly a third for some companies in the last year. NuStar Energy and ArchRock in recent weeks said they would cut income distributions to the general partners and combine units, shifting away from the general and limited partners structures common among energy pipeline and storage firms. Competitor TallGrass Energy in early February said it was considering a similar change. “Removing a layer of complexity makes a lot more investible,” said James Mick, a portfolio manager for Tortoise, which invests in energy master limited partnerships (MLPs). Private equity firms have been successfully acquiring pipeline operators in the shale patch because of their lower cost of capital. They are proving strong rivals to MLPs for these deals because of their willingness to use more debt financing. Nustar, Archrock and TallGrass did not respond to requests for comment. An early move away from partnership models came in 2014 when Kinder Morgan Inc, then the largest publicly traded pipeline partnership, folded three units into a single company to address investor concerns about its growth and financial structure. Mick estimates that up to 75 percent of the MLPs Tortoise covers will have eliminated incentive distribution rights within the next two years to free up cash for growth. As of last year, about 51 percent had eliminated their payouts, called Incentive Distribution Rights (IDRs), compared with 4 percent in 2007, he said. Another factor in the restructurings are institutional investors seeking stronger governance and more independent boards. In some cases, about 80 percent of a limited partner’s board will be comprised of individuals appointed by the general partner, investors said. “In the real world, I don’t see how directors can be truly independent and represent the best interests of the limited partners if they can be fired by the general partner,” said Kevin McCarthy, a managing partner at investment firm Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors. Restructuring the partnerships to resemble corporations could draw renewed interest from investors, helping the firms raise new cash. “Our view is that governance has to change if the sector is going to move to the next level and attract the attention of long-only institutional investors,” McCarthy added. Although mature MLPs are revamping their structures, newer firms that go public are expected to continue using mechanisms such as IDRs to encourage growth. Hess Corp and BP Plc last year both launched MLPs that included incentive distribution payments to partners. “It is unlikely they will go away for new issuance and partnership structures moving forward. They are simply too lucrative if executed correctly,” said Ethan Bellamy, a senior research analyst with R.W. Baird & Co.

106,KMI,Alberta premier says willing to buy Trans Mountain pipeline,"VANCOUVER/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Alberta on Tuesday doubled down on its pledge to financially support a troubled pipeline expansion, saying the province could buy the project outright from Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd as Canada’s federal government reiterated it was “100 percent” behind the build. Texas-based Kinder Morgan said on Sunday it would scrap plans to nearly triple the capacity of its Trans Mountain pipeline, which extends from Alberta to British Columbia’s coast, unless various legal and jurisdictional challenges could be resolved by May 31. The ultimatum prompted swift responses from Alberta and Ottawa, with both levels of government signaling interest in spending public funds to ensure the project proceeds. Shareholders backed the gamble.  “We are considering a number of financial options to ensure that the Trans Mountain expansion is built, up to and including purchasing the pipeline outright if it was to come to that,” Premier Rachel Notley said in a statement provided to Reuters.     Notley was not immediately available to clarify whether she was referring to both the existing pipeline operations and the C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) expansion project or just the latter. She had previously said Alberta could take a stake in the project. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Cabinet held meetings on Tuesday to discuss its options for the controversial project, which is desperately needed by industry but fiercely opposed by the province of British Columbia, along with certain municipalities and aboriginal groups. The issue is a major political challenge for Trudeau, who approved the expansion in 2016. Critics have said he needs to be more forceful with both the West Coast province and protesters who have repeatedly blocked Kinder Morgan work sites.     “We’ve been saying for the last two days we’re prepared to look at many options, and that has not changed,” Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr told reporters in brief remarks following the meeting. “The government is 100 percent behind this pipeline.” Carr had previously said Ottawa was looking at whether to take a stake in the project. But the industry was less enthusiastic. “We need foreign businesses like Kinder to be saying we are an enviable place to do business in, not a place that I had to sell my asset to the government,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a portfolio manager at Canoe Financial. Kinder Morgan Canada said it was consulting with the government and would not comment until those talks are complete. Its shares stabilized on Tuesday, closing up 3.66 percent at C$16.71 after shedding 12.6 percent the day before. Whether or not governments step up with financial backing, the company’s struggles are another black mark for Canada, which used to be a prime destination for foreign investment, said Robert Skinner, executive fellow at The School of Public Policy, University of Calgary. “We used to wear this as a badge of honor - that we were not like the tin-pot regimes around the world where they carry kalashnikov (rifles),” he said. “Canada, ironically, has become a high political risk investment zone for oil and gas.” ",4102018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kinder-morgan-cn-pipeline/alberta-premier-says-willing-to-buy-trans-mountain-pipeline-idUSKBN1HH39E
107,KMI,Investors back Kinder Morgan Canada's Trans Mountain move,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Canada shareholders on Tuesday backed the pipeline operator’s decision to pause most work on its Trans Mountain expansion as a way to force the Canadian government to give final approval for the project. The company said on Sunday it would scrap plans to nearly triple the capacity of its existing Trans Mountain pipeline, which extends from Alberta to British Columbia’s coast, unless various legal and jurisdictional challenges could be resolved by May 31. The project was approved by the federal government in 2016, but that approval is being challenged in court by First Nation groups and local municipalities, and British Columbia is eyeing whether it has jurisdiction to block increased oil shipments through its territory. The Trans Mountain expansion, backed by Canadian oil producers, had an operational date of December 2019, but in October the company pushed that to September 2020 because of what it said was the difficulty in obtaining permits. A survey of four analysts and investors showed Kinder Morgan Canada’s fair value without the project to be around C$13.50, or 20 percent lower than the stock’s closing price of C$16.71 on Tuesday. Yet, Kinder Morgan’s move found support among shareholders. “They are trying to get something resolved over the next several weeks, protecting shareholders money,” said Paul Bloom, chief investment officer at Bloom Investments Counsel Inc. His firm owns a 0.3 percent stake in Kinder Morgan Canada. “If it doesn’t go through, Kinder Morgan has other assets. The stock will go down, but it’s not worthless,” Bloom said. He pegs the real value without the expansion at C$14.00. Kinder Morgan Canada Chief Executive Steven Kean told analysts on Monday the company had growth prospects and the potential to participate in mergers and acquisitions if the Trans Mountain project did not go ahead, and it would consider returning excess cash to shareholders. British Columbia, the province where the proposed expansion would run through a conservation area, is gunning to block increased oil shipments through its territory. Both Canadian federal government and the provincial government in Alberta have backed the project with Alberta’s Premier Rachel Notley saying the province was prepared to be an investor in the pipeline. “If they put money or provide loan guarantees to the project, that could be a very big win for the shareholders because they will have to put in less risk to receive the end result of a built pipeline,” said Bloom. According to Thomson Reuters data, intrinsic value for Kinder Morgan Canada’s stock is C$16.93 and it trades at about 27.3 times their 12-month forward earnings compared with the energy sector average of 21.8 times. “The company would have a very strong balance sheet and other potential options to deploy capital, so it wouldn’t be a disaster for them, or us as investors,” said Jim Hall, chairman of Mawer Investment Management. Mawer holds more than 1 percent in Kinder Morgan Canada and expects the stock to be valued at C$14.00-$15.00 without the expansion. Moreover, reduced spending on the expansion project should improve parent Kinder Morgan’s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said. “The company has done the right thing, drawing a line in the sand, making it crystal clear where the company stands,” Bloom added.

109,KMI,4th Circuit revives suit against Kinder Morgan over Plantation Pipe Line rupture,"A divided appeals court on Thursday revived a Clean Water Act lawsuit by two environmental groups that want Kinder Morgan to do more to clean up gasoline from a 2014 rupture of its Plantation Pipe Line in Belton, South Carolina. The 2-1 panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed last year’s ruling by a federal judge in South Carolina, who found that the citizen-lawsuit provisions of the Clean Water Act did not apply to the lawsuit filed by Savannah Riverkeeper and Upstate Forever because the pipeline had been repaired and the initial spill did not directly contaminate any water sources.

110,KMI,Kinder Morgan says investment in oil pipeline expansion may be untenable,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) said on Wednesday that recent events confirm an investment in the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion may be “untenable” and said Ottawa’s pledge of financial support does not resolve political risk related to British Columbia’s opposition. The comments come as the British Columbia (B.C.) government pledged to file a legal challenge by month-end to determine whether it has the jurisdiction to stop the C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) project, which was approved by the federal government in 2016 and would nearly triple capacity on the pipeline from Alberta to a Vancouver-area port. Kinder Morgan Canada (KML.TO), a unit of Kinder Morgan, halted most spending on the expansion earlier this month and set a May 31 deadline to decide if it would scrap the project entirely, citing legal and jurisdictional issues. “As we said then, it’s become clear this particular investment may be untenable for a private party to undertake. The events of the last 10 days have confirmed those views,” Chief Executive Steven Kean said on a conference call. While Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada is prepared to offer financial aid to ensure the project goes ahead, Kean dodged a question about whether that support would ensure construction. “They’re really two separate things,” he said. “Most of the investment is in British Columbia, where the government is in opposition to the project ... That is an issue that, in our view, needs to be resolved.”  The Trans Mountain expansion is considered crucial for Alberta’s oil industry which has been beset by transportation bottlenecks. It is fiercely opposed by some B.C. cities, some aboriginal groups, and environmentalists concerned about possible oil spills. The company said while it is not in a position to move on takeovers until the uncertainty around Trans Mountain is resolved, it sees good opportunities in the western Canadian midstream space. “There are some very capable players with good midstream assets,” Kean said, adding: “Intent is, and was, that KML would be the vehicle to invest in those opportunities.”  The company has a strong balance sheet and is well positioned for takeovers, especially if cash earmarked for capital projects is freed up, said M. Paul Bloom, investment manager with Bloom Investment Counsel. “I think you can expect if the Trans Mountain pipeline does not go ahead (Kinder Morgan) will be bidders for various assets here in Canada, and probably fairly quickly as well,” he said. Kinder Morgan Canada, which was spun off from parent Kinder Morgan in May last year, reported a net income of C$44.4 million ($35.17 million) for the first quarter ended March 31, down from C$46.8 million for the same period last year.  Texas-based Kinder Morgan separately reported net income available to common stockholders of $485 million, or 22 cents per share, in the quarter to the end of March, compared with $401 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier.

The western Canadian province, which is opposed to Kinder Morgan Canada’s (KML.TO) planned Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, said it had filed its so-called reference question in the B.C.

The case seeks “to confirm the scope and extent of provincial powers to regulate environmental and economic risks related to heavy oils like diluted bitumen,” British Columbia Attorney General David Eby told reporters. Eby added that the matter was “highly unlikely” to be resolved by a May 31 deadline set by Kinder Morgan to decide if construction would proceed or not on the C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) project. Kinder Morgan halted work on the expansion earlier this month, citing resistance from the Pacific Coast province, and said it would the scrap the project if it does not receive the certainty it needed by its deadline. That has sent the federal government and the oil-rich province of Alberta scrambling to provide the company with financial and political support for the project, which would nearly triple capacity on an existing pipeline from Alberta to the B.C. coast.

120,KMI,Norway's wealth fund to back environmental motions at Kinder Morgan AGM,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund said on Tuesday it would support a resolution to be presented at Kinder Morgan’s (KMI.N) annual general meeting calling on the U.S. energy infrastructure firm to reduce its methane emissions.  The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund is seeking to get the 9,000 firms it invests in to disclose non-financial data, including on carbon emissions, and to stress tests their businesses against the risks posed by climate change. “We will support the shareholder resolution asking for a report reviewing Kinder Morgan’s policies, actions and plans to measure, monitor, mitigate, disclose and set quantitative reduction targets for methane emissions from all operations, including storage and transportation,” it said in a statement. Kinder Morgan owns and controls oil and gas pipelines and terminals in North America.  The motion is one of three motions to be presented by some shareholders of Kinder Morgan that the fund will support and that Kinder Morgan’s management opposes, fund data shows.  The other two are shareholder proposals for the firm to have a report on sustainability and another for it to assess the impact on its portfolio of policies to limit a rise in global average temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).  The fund has a stake of 0.87 percent in Kinder Morgan valuing it at $352 million at end-2017. It rarely discloses its voting intentions ahead of time. The fund, which invests the proceeds from Norway’s oil and gas production for future pensions in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad, is one of the world’s biggest shareholders, with stakes totaling 1.4 percent of all listed companies.
