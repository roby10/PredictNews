1,ACN,UPDATE 4-Infosys cautious on outlook after Q1 disappoints," * Q1 profit 17.22 bln rupees vs 17.29 bln rupees in Reuters poll   * Maintains fiscal 2012 dollar revenue growth at 18-20 percent   * Adds 26 clients in Q1, slowest pace in at least four years   * Growth in second half will be better than first half-exec   * Shares fall as much as 6 percent in a weak Mumbai market   (Adds details, updates share price)	   By Tenzin Dekeva and Sayantani Ghosh	   MYSORE, India, July 12 (Reuters) - India’s No.2 software services exporter Infosys Ltd warned on Tuesday it faces a volatile global economy that could slow client spending, sending its shares down the most in three months.	   The company, long considered a bellwether for India’s showcase $76 billion software and services sector, disclosed its new client additions were the lowest in at least four years.	   Its costs are also increasing because it is paying higher wages to retain talent in the ultra-competitive industry that added 240,000 jobs in the last fiscal year to March 31.	   Infosys narrowly missed expectations with a 15.4 percent rise in first-quarter profit, the fourth time in five quarters it has fallen short of expectations. 	   “Infosys has been losing the habit of out-performing on expectations,” said Tejas Doshi at Sushil Finance in Mumbai. 	   Infosys, however, expects growth in the second half of its fiscal year to be better than the first half on increased spending by clients in sectors such as retail and energy, B.G. Srinivas, a member of the Infosys board, told Reuters.	   Analysts had expected Infosys to upgrade its cautious forecast as investors had already factored in higher revenue growth for the full year.	   Its shares were hammered in Mumbai, falling as much as 6 percent. The stock was trading down 5 percent at 0900 GMT in a Mumbai market down 2 percent.    	   The earnings announcement comes about two weeks after U.S. technology outsourcing and consulting firm Accenture  raised its annual earnings forecast and posted results that beat Wall Street estimates. 	   U.S. companies often benefit at the expense of their Indian rivals when U.S. spending slows and American companies get criticised for outsourcing overseas.	   Bangalore-based Infosys , also listed on the Nasdaq, said consolidated net profit rose to 17.22 billion rupees ($387 million), from 14.88 billion rupees a year earlier. Revenue rose about 21 percent to 74.85 billion rupees.	   A Reuters poll of brokerages had forecast a profit of 17.29 billion rupees on revenue of 75.2 billion rupees for the company, which counts Goldman Sachs , BT Group and BP among its main clients.    	   “This is an environment where we need to be cautious. You can look at all the things which are happening,” said the company’s chief operating officer, S.D. Shibulal, who will take over as chief executive next month.	   “There is still economic instability...there is the European crisis still unfolding. There is always talk about the government spending coming to an end,” he said.	   European shares fell on Tuesday as officials struggled to contain fears that the euro zone debt crisis was spreading to Italy and Spain. 	    More than 70 percent of Infosys’ revenue is generated in the United States and Europe, “making Infosys vulnerable to the global economy and creating volatility for the company,” said John Lin, manager of Uni-President Asset Management’s Chindia Fund in Taiwan.	   “Top-line growth is faster than bottom-line growth, meaning its costs are rising more than the company had forecast.”	   Infosys maintained its dollar revenue growth forecast at 18 percent to 20 percent for the fiscal year ending March 2012 to $7.13 billion to $7.25 billion. Analysts expected full-year  growth of 20 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   The firm slightly raised its earnings per American shares growth forecast to 10-11.5 percent from 8-10 percent view in April.	   “At this point of time we are very cautious because the global economic environment has not recovered. The volatility still continues,” said Infosys chief financial officer, V. Balakrishnan.	   “All the uncertainty we talked about in the last quarter still remains. In fact, in Europe it has only now become bigger,” he told a television channel.	   Infosys added 26 clients in the quarter, its slowest pace of quarterly customer acquisition in at least four years, highlighting global economic uncertainty and concerns about top management changes at the company.	   In April, Infosys announced the retirement of its billionaire chairman, N.R. Narayana Murthy, who will step down in August, and said current chief executive, S. Gopalakrishnan, will become co-chairman.	   The board also said S.D. Shibulal, a founder of the company and currently chief operating officer, will become the new chief executive.	   Infosys posted a 15.4 percent rise in fiscal first quarter profit, but was hurt as wage hikes crimped margins amid intense competition from rivals such as IBM , Accenture and Tata Consultancy.	   Infosys executives on Tuesday said a growth rate of 18 to 20 percent was not enough to help the company absorb the wage increases of more than 10 percent.	   “There is one negative that the full-year dollar revenue guidance has not been increased,” said Rohit Anand, an analyst at PINC Research. “The major concern is demand at this point of time. So I think the key number is the full-year outlook.”	   The Infosys results and management comments triggered worries about the sector outlook with shares in rival Tata Consultancy falling 1.4 percent and Wipro trading 2.7 percent lower. Tata Consultancy and Wipro report earnings later this month.	    While Infosys expressed caution on Tuesday, India’s IT sector is growing due to improved pricing for its services and increased outsourcing by companies looking to cut costs and boost efficiency.	   According to research firm Gartner, the global IT market will expand 7.1 percent this year, up from its previous projection of 5.6 percent growth, which bodes well for top Indian exporters like Infosys. 	   Operating margins at Infosys about 3 percent in the quarter ended June and Balakrishnan said the margins were expected to drop 2.5 percent in the fiscal year to March 2012, less than a previous forecast of a 3 percent fall.

2,ACN,Wipro's disappointing outlook pull shares down 5 percent,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - Wipro Ltd (WIPR.NS), India’s No.3 software services exporter, forecast growth below market expectations, signaling the widening gap between Indian technology firms and their bigger global rivals in winning new deals in a tough economy.  Shares in Bangalore-based Wipro, which also makes computer hardware, electric bulbs, soaps and toiletries, dropped nearly 5 percent on the disappointing outlook despite the firm posting forecast-beating fiscal first quarter net profit.  IBM (IBM.N) and Accenture (ACN.N), who compete with Indian services providers such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS) Infosys (INFY.NS) and Wipro, raised their annual earnings forecasts earlier this month after quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates.  Growth in India’s $76 billion software services sector has slowed down in recent quarters due to global economic uncertainty, severe competition, rising wages, high staff turnover rates and management shakeups at Infosys and Wipro.  The rupee’s rise against the dollar is another concern for the export-driven outsourcing sector, which exports a large chunk of its services to the United States but chalks up expenses in rupees.  “Apart from the global economy, wage hikes and attrition are additional challenges that IT firms will have to continue to grapple with,” said Kaushik Dani, a fund manager with Peerless Mutual Fund, which owns Infosys and Tata Consultancy shares.  No. 2 software services provider Infosys last week reported quarterly profit that missed expectations and warned it could face slow client spending, while Tata Consultancy (TCS.NS) flagged concerns about economic uncertainty.  Wipro has been struggling to keep up with TCS and Infosys in winning large outsourcing contracts and reorganized its management earlier this year to boost growth.  Wipro (WIT.N) in January surprised markets by removing the joint chiefs of the business and naming company veteran Kurien as the new chief executive. Later, it reorganized business units under the IT services and named new unit heads.  Wipro Chief Executive T.K. Kurien said the company, which gets three-quarters of its revenue from IT services, would see a positive impact of the management restructuring after couple of quarters and that would be sustained in the longer term.  “You can put lipstick on a pig and make it look good...but it is never going to be sustainable until and unless you go back to the core of the business and change the quality of the revenue,” he said in a television interview.  The company forecast revenue from its IT services unit at $1.44 billion to $1.46 billion in the fiscal second quarter to end-September, indicating a rise of 2.1 to 3.5 percent from the first quarter.  Analysts had expected at least a 4 percent sequential rise in IT services revenue forecast.  “Given that this quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for the Indian IT sector, Wipro’s growth forecast is decent but not outstanding,” said Rohit Anand, a sector analyst with Mumbai-based PINC Research.  Wipro shares, which the market values at about $23 billion, were trading down 4.6 percent at 396.15 rupees by 0810 GMT, on course to post their biggest drop in more than three months. The Mumbai market .NSEI was down 0.5 percent.  Azim Premji, Wipro’s billionaire chairman, said the uncertain economic environment had resulted in volatility in business, but the company was not seeing delays in the IT spending decision making process by customers.  “Customers are preparing for a longer period of uncertainty and are looking for new avenues to grow their business,” said Premji, who had quit engineering degree at Stanford to take over his father’s ailing vegetable oil business in the mid-1960s.  He diversified the vegetable oil business into hydraulic cylinders in the 1970s and software services in 1980.  Wipro said IT services revenue rose 0.5 percent in April-June to $1.41 billion from the quarter ago. Anand of PINC Research said he had expected the company to report more than 1 percent rise.  Wipro, which develops software applications, integrates IT systems and manages call centers, said consolidated net profit rose 1.2 percent to 13.35 billion rupees ($300 million) in the June quarter from 13.19 billion a year ago.  Revenue rose 18 percent to 85.64 billion rupees, as it added 49 new clients in the quarter and western clients increased spending on outsourced services to cut costs and boost efficiency amid global economic uncertainty.  This compares with a Reuters poll forecast of a profit of 13.16 billion rupees on revenue of 83.91 billion rupees for Wipro, which counts Citigroup (C.N), Cisco (CSCO.O) and Credit Suisse CSGN.VX among its clients.  Wipro increased its IT services staff by 4,105 employees in the quarter to 126,490.  Still, the rate of attrition at Wipro was higher than rivals, rising to 23.2 percent despite 12-15 percent wage hikes.  Operating margins at its IT services business fell to 22 percent from 24.5 percent in year-ago period and Wipro said margins in this quarter would remain under pressure.  Wipro revenue growth in this fiscal year to March 2012 might be lower than the outsourcing sector’s 16-18 percent growth, but the company does not see pressure on prices for its services in the coming quarters, Chief Financial Officer Suresh Senapaty said.

5,ACN,Obama proposes tax credits for hiring veterans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday proposed $120 million in new tax credits for businesses that hire U.S. veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan at a time of stubbornly high unemployment at home.  During a visit to Washington’s Navy Yard, Obama unveiled a “reverse boot camp” program to help soldiers return to civilian life and set a goal for companies to hire or train 100,000 unemployed veterans and their spouses by the end of next year.  While many veterans who enlisted after the September 11 attacks returned from Iraq and Afghanistan and slid into the workforce, the president said, others have struggled to find a job “worthy of their experience and worthy of their talent.”  “Over the last few years, another generation of young veterans has learned that the challenges don’t end in Kandahar or Baghdad. They continue right here at home,” Obama said.  The winding down of military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq has released thousands of veterans into an already weak U.S. job market and that pace is due to accelerate.  In July, the jobless rate for those who served since September 11, 2001, stood at 12.4 percent, compared to 9.1 percent for the overall population, figures released on Friday showed.  The relatively modest measures were announced as Obama, fresh from a bruising fight over deficits and debt, is under pressure to find ways to boost U.S. economic growth and bolster job creation while keeping spending in check.  His proposed new “Returning Heroes Tax Credit” gives $2,400 to companies for each veteran they hire who has been unemployed for less than six months and $4,800 for those unemployed for half a year or more, administration officials said.  And the existing “Wounded Warriors Tax Credit” — paid out for hiring wounded veterans — would be doubled to $9,600 for taking on someone unemployed for six months or longer.  The White House estimated the plan’s cost at $120 million over two years. It would require congressional approval and be funded from the existing budget.  Beyond the tax credit, Obama said, the Pentagon and Veterans Affairs Department would invest more to help soldiers make the transition to civilian careers — particularly finding ways to match their training with industry-accepted credentials.  According to the Defense Department, 88 percent of military jobs have “direct civilian counterparts.” But most U.S. states require veterans to retrain before they can take similar civilian positions.  Obama said it was critical that regulators and companies recognize the very relevant training many veterans have already received, using paramedics and finance officers as examples.  “If you can save a life in Afghanistan you can save a life in an ambulance in Wyoming,” he said. “If you can oversee millions of dollars of assets in Iraq you can help a business balance its books here at home.”  He said Siemens had hired 300 veterans and aimed to hire an additional 150 by December, and Microsoft would help 10,000 veterans get IT-certified over the next two years. Lockheed Martin, Accenture and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have also agreed “to do their part to help veterans get back in the workforce,” he said, offering no details.  Admiral Mike Mullen, the top U.S. military officer, told the Washington Navy Yard audience that former troops had much to offer the private sector in a variety of roles.  “They are smart, tech-savvy, wired to serve and great leaders. They will make terrific employees, and I can tell you this, they darn sure know how to show up on time,” he said.

7,ACN,Computer Sciences a likely target for breakup,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a series of failed takeover attempts and accounting scandals, Computer Sciences Corp is attracting potential activist investors looking to take advantage of a weak share price to push for a breakup.  The $4.5 billion market cap company’s shares have dropped 40 percent so far this year to below $30, valuing it at a steep discount to peers.  Its government services business faces an uncertain outlook amid prospective cuts in U.S. government spending, dragging down the value of its higher growth Information Technology services.  Adding to its problems, Computer Sciences is also caught up in an accounting investigation, shareholder lawsuits and a long dispute with the U.K. National Health Service regarding alleged delays in developing healthcare IT systems.  Activist investors are doing the math, evaluating a breakup and other ways to boost Computer Sciences’ sagging share price, people familiar with the situation said. But Computer Sciences is aware of the pressure and has been reviewing it options as well, the people added.  Representatives for Computer Sciences declined comment.  Computer Sciences has been a target of multiple takeover attempts in the past and investors and potential buyers have long bet that separating the Falls Church, Virginia-based company’s commercial IT services from its government services could boost value.  Its North American Public Sector, which provides outsourcing and consulting services to the Defense Department and other federal agencies, accounts for a little more than a third of its revenues.  The rest comes from data-center outsourcing and developing enterprise software applications. Computer Sciences’ revenues totaled $16.2 billion in the 12 months ended July 1, 2011.  The company trades at about 6 times its earnings. Accenture Public Ltd Co, a close competitor in terms of size, scale and reach, trades at about 17 times earnings, said Morningstar analyst Swami Shanmugasundaram.  Shanmugasundaram said the commercial business has a higher growth profile and better margins than the government business, and splitting them up would “definitely” be good for shareholders.  “Because of its growth profile and execution issues ... I do expect CSC to trade at a discount (to peers), but this is too much of a discount,” he said.  People familiar with Computer Sciences management’s thinking said the company believes the two units belong together and it wants to sort out several pending issues before determining its strategic direction.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is in the middle of a probe related to Computer Sciences’ accounting errors, which primarily involve accounting irregularities in Europe’s Nordic region.  The issues could “divert management’s focus, result in substantial investigation expenses and have an adverse impact on the firm’s reputation and financial condition,” Computer Sciences has said in a statement.  The U.K. government, meanwhile, is reviewing whether a contract to install next-generation healthcare IT systems in the country should be continued after Computer Sciences allegedly missed deadlines. The company said this week it would likely meet the U.K. health agency in September to discuss the matter.  These challenges could prove a hurdle for any activists looking to buy into the company.  Activists would also have to wait it out if they launched a campaign either against the board, as all 10 Computer Sciences board members have been just reelected for a full year. The current board members have served long terms, with only four of the directors joining after 2007.  Over the last decade or so, private equity firms, big technology companies and prime defense contractors have looked at the company as a takeover target, but its presence in both the commercial and government sectors proved to be a hurdle.  In early 2006, Computer Sciences received an offer in the low $60s per share from a consortium of three private equity firms and a large technology company, the sources said.  But Chief Executive Van Honeycutt wanted at least $65 per share and rejected the bid, they said.  Lockheed Martin Corp was also interested at the time, but was not prepared to buy the entire company and its efforts did not gain traction, these people said.  In 1998, Computer Associates — now known as CA Technologies — unsuccessfully made a hostile $9.8 billion takeover bid for Computer Sciences.  It is unclear if any of these or other potential buyers would still be interested. Hewlett Packard Co bought Computer Sciences competitor EDS for $13.9 billion in 2008, while others such as Dell Inc and Oracle Corp have different priorities for takeovers, sources said.  The sheer size of a deal would also be a challenge for private equity firms in the near term, sources said.  But if government and commercial businesses were separated in a tax-free spinoff, the two units would attract more buyers, the sources said.  “If the company is really going to earn what Wall Street thinks it’s going to earn, it is extremely attractive from a value perspective,” a source said.  “That said, the company needs to reposition strategically and the question is: Can they get there on their own?”  ",8122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-dealtalk-computersciences/computer-sciences-a-likely-target-for-breakup-idUSTRE77B5Y920110812

11,ACN,"In close race for No 1, Deloitte, PwC grow apace","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forget struggling economies, aggressive regulators, penny-pinching business clients.  The world’s two largest accounting and consulting firms are bulking up with acquisitions and combing the globe for new hires.  Head-to-head in a race for the title of world’s largest private professional services firm, Deloitte and PwC are on a major expansion drive.  With audit revenues leveling off in developed markets, the firms have been making a push in growing countries such as China and India and plowing ahead with investments in consulting, where business is growing after a recessionary slump.  More is at stake than bragging rights. Just as important is cementing their status as professional service supermarkets, able to help clients in almost any market where commerce transpires.  “The more they position themselves as a truly trusted one-stop solution provider to clients, the more they can hope to be more immune to fee pressures from clients that might increase if the economy worsened,” said Ashley Newton, associate director at Kennedy Consulting Research and Advisory.  Last year, a 15 percent jump in the consulting area helped Deloitte overtake PwC as No. 1 in total revenues among the big four global accounting and consulting firms, which also include KPMG and Ernst & Young.  Deloitte claimed the lead by a margin of just $9 million, reporting $26.578 billion revenues to PwC’s $26.569 billion. Prior to 2010, PwC had been the largest for at least five years, according to data from Accounting News Report.  One factor behind the win was Deloitte’s decision to hold on to its consulting arm about a decade ago while other audit firms shed theirs amid concerns of conflict of interest.  The decision helped Deloitte keep its grip on the high-potential area of information technology, a business with good growth prospects even in a dodgy economy. Consulting got a further boost from Deloitte acquisitions such as the government business of BearingPoint in 2009.  Although regulators in the United States and elsewhere have tightened restrictions on the consulting services auditors can provide, consulting has not been prohibited outright, and both Deloitte and PwC have focused their consulting work largely on companies that are not audit clients.  Powerful brand names and close ties with C-suite executives, built partly through audit relationships, have helped make all of the big four formidable competitors in consulting, according to Gartner Research.  “What the audit work does is allow them to create competence in an industry,” building credibility that is a big plus in pulling in consulting work, said Gartner analyst Alex Soejarto.  The move into consulting has been going on for some time, partly because it is far more profitable than mandatory audit work, said Arvind Hickman, editor of International Accounting Bulletin.  “Audit is labor-intensive and has suffered a lot from fee pressure due to the global financial crisis.”  PwC, which sold its consulting arm to IBM in 2002, has been rebuilding its consulting muscle with acquisitions such as Paragon Consulting Group and the commercial services business of BearingPoint in 2009.  Over the past 12 months, it picked up 700 consultants with its purchase of management consulting firm PRTM and hundreds more through its acquisition of Diamond Management & Technology Consultants. Recently it announced it was building its edge in the so-called sustainability or responsible resource use area, by taking on “green” business consultant Andrew Winston as an adviser.  Still the worldwide leader in audit revenues, it also has targeted emerging markets such as India, China and the Middle East to rev up growth.  Deloitte has bought a slew of consulting firms, including energy consultants Altos Management Partners and AJM Petroleum Consultants; performance management advisory firm Jackson Browne; economic consultancy Access Economics and business analytics firm Oco. It also beefed up in the sustainability area, picking up Clear Carbon Consulting and DOMANI Sustainability Consulting.  Full-service clout has helped the firms compete against a range of firms, from management giants such as McKinsey to technology consultants such as IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Accenture (ACN.N).  Both Deloitte and PwC have been hiring nonstop.  PwC said its member firms across the globe hired about 45,000 new staff in the 2011 fiscal year ended in June. Deloitte will not announce its hires until it releases fiscal 2011 revenue figures, but said it was on track with a projection announced last year of 50,000 hires a year globally over the coming five years.  The big four are expected to report their fiscal 2011 revenues in coming weeks and any significant growth will likely once again be in the consulting area, said Jonathan Hamilton, managing editor of Accounting News Report.  “The audit business, while certainly the staple of all these firms, is a slow-growth business,” Hamilton added.  The firms’ growth raises challenges, however, such as assuring quality as their empires expand.  “They are really individual firms that are badged together, but they don’t have a tight centralized control,” said Shan Nair, chief executive of Nair & Co, which advises companies on international expansion and works with the big four firms.  Expansion in China, a key market, has already brought headaches in the audit area. The Chinese arms of both Deloitte and PwC have had to drop clients because of concerns about their accounting and Deloitte’s Shanghai office has been subpoenaed for records by U.S. regulators.  More worries loom from stepped-up regulatory scrutiny. As consulting revenues grow, complaints are surfacing again that firms will be tempted to go easy on audit clients for the sake of winning or keeping a consulting job — a charge the audit firms deny.  Last week, European Union lawmakers approved a report that calls for barring auditors from providing audit and non-audit services to the same client. The report is nonbinding but could shape a draft law in the works.  PwC and Deloitte both said there was no conflict of interest in the consulting services they provide. Much of their consulting is done for companies they do not audit and they follow regulators’ standards and companies’ own restrictions on the kind of consulting they do for audit clients.  PwC also said it follows a code of ethics set by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants to assure its independence.  Also to the firms’ advantage, much of their consulting work — such as helping companies cut costs and become more efficient — should be in demand even if the economy slows, analysts said.  “All-in-all, I’d say they’re generally taking a pretty prudent approach to expansion, even if it is aggressive,” said Newton at Kennedy Consulting Research.

13,ACN,DEALTALK-Queuing for CoreLogic: one sale or several?," * Two strategic and five private equity players line up   * May have to sell itself piecemeal - analysts   * FDIC suit, management issues could be hurdles    By Aditi Sharma and Rachana Khanzode	   Sept 23 (Reuters) - At least seven firms, mainly private equity, have shown interest in data and analytics company CoreLogic Inc , attracted by its growth businesses and relatively cheap valuations.	   Analysts are divided over whether CoreLogic — which has hired boutique advisory firm Greenhill to explore a possible sale — may be sold whole or in pieces.	   Spun off from First American Corp in June 2010, CoreLogic put itself in the shop window due to a U.S. housing slump that prompted it last month to slash its full-year outlook to below analysts’ expectations.	   At least two strategic buyers and five private equity firms have shown interest in the company, said a source with knowledge of the process. The source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, declined to name the companies.	   CoreLogic declined to comment for this article.	   IBM , Infosys , Accenture and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) were among some names cited by analysts as potential bidders.	   Santa Ana, California-based CoreLogic operates in two segments: business and information services, such as property tax data, flood data, and appraisal and default management; and data and analytics, including property and mortgage securities information, and credit solutions.	   Its second-quarter revenue fell 4 percent year-on-year to $396 million, as a housing slump brought down mortgage originations and hit earnings.	   But the data and analytics business showed continued growth in risk and fraud services.	   “I think their complete business is more valuable than in pieces,” said Morningstar analyst Brett Horn, noting the parts of the business dealing with residential real estate, mortgages and the processing and data market all support each other.	   “Just selling these pieces separately to different buyers is probably not going to be the most effective way to realise their value.”	   CoreLogic shares sank to an 11-year low of $7.64 late last month after the company slashed its outlook, but have since partly recovered on news the company might be sold.  	   The stock last traded at $10.79, but is still down 40 percent year-to-date, underperforming an 11 percent drop on the S&P Midcap Data Processing & Outsources Services sub-index  .	   Some analysts reckon the shares look undervalued because investors have focused on this year’s earnings in isolation.	   One CoreLogic shareholder said, ultimately, it comes down to price.	   “If it’s keen to sell itself for $14 a share and asks shareholders to vote, I’d say ‘No’. But if they say we’re getting a great price, then I’d support it,” said the shareholder, who asked not to be named.	   Private investment firm TPG Capital paid about 11 times EBITDA when it bought MDA DataQuick, a CoreLogic competitor in business and information services, last year.	   That makes it possible for CoreLogic to get 11-12 times its multiple from some private equity firm, the investor said, suggesting a price of above $18 a share.  	   Morningstar’s Horn believes CoreLogic could even fetch a 30 percent premium — around equal to the stock’s trading level just 7 weeks ago.	   “When you look at Lender Processing Services , Fiserv  , Experian , Verisk Analytics , D&B  and Equifax , companies that do the same kind of work, they trade at about 8 times EBITDA, and CoreLogic is priced far below that on a consolidated basis,” the investor said.	   The businesses CoreLogic is most likely to want to sell are the defaults — sitting on record levels of distressed mortgages and expected to drag down overall earnings — and appraisals, said Horn.	   Stephens Inc analyst Carter Malloy said CoreLogic’s unique data and analytics assets, which are showing growth, would likely attract most interest, however.	   “The risk and fraud segment is really the crown jewel, and that’s what I think people are really interested in,” the CoreLogic shareholder said.	   Keeping pace with booming demand for data storage and analytics companies, Teradata Corp this year bought Aster Data for $263 million, and Aprimo for $525 million  , while U.S.-based payment processor FIS had planned to buy UK software firm Misys , but later opted instead for a share buy-back. 	   Tempted bidders will also have to be aware of outstanding issues at CoreLogic.	   Such as the $129 million in damages sought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) over CoreLogic’s alleged negligence in preparing appraisals for Washington Mutual. 	   “Assuming these disputes remain outstanding, we believe any buyer of CoreLogic would have to be comfortable taking on this potential liability,” said Greg Smith, analyst at Sterne Agee.	   CoreLogic shareholders are also pressing for management changes as the company went six months without a chief financial officer.	   CoreLogic, which has been divesting non-core assets, sold its employer services and litigation support business last December , and was paid $50 million in July by Cognizant Technology Solutions for its India-based CoreLogic Global Services Pvt Ltd unit.

14,ACN,"Stocks gains on Europe, Accenture rises late","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose for a third day on Tuesday on efforts by euro-zone officials to solidify the region’s rescue fund and alleviate a sovereign debt crisis, boosting optimism.  But equities ended off their highs for the day after a report suggested cracks were emerging in a previously agreed deal to tackle the crisis.  A successful solution to Europe’s sovereign debt crisis would take the pressure off banks worried about funding and remove a threat to economic growth. Rising hopes for an agreement have helped push the S&P 500 up more than 4 percent since Thursday’s close.  That’s the biggest three-day percentage gain by the S&P 500  since mid-August. So far this week, the CBOE volatility index is down more than 10 percent.  “It’s great to see some steps toward resolution. Shoring up banks and dealing with the region’s fiscal issues is a real positive for equities,” said Malcolm Polley, president and chief investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors in Indiana, Pennsylvania.  The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 146.83 points, or 1.33 percent, at 11,190.69. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 12.44 points, or 1.07 percent, at 1,175.39. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 30.14 points, or 1.20 percent, at 2,546.83.  The S&P materials index was up 2.1 percent and an S&P index of energy stocks added 1.5 percent as commodity prices rallied on hopes of a solution in Europe. Mining and energy shares were the top performers among large-cap stocks.  While European officials have considered various approaches to maximize the bailout fund and to recapitalize banks, substantial political hurdles to sealing the deal remain.  The Financial Times reported a split was developing in the euro zone over the terms of the next bailout for Greece. However, this had been reported earlier in the day.  German and French government economic advisers urged in a joint article on Tuesday that Greece be allowed to write off around 50 percent of its debt and called for support for banks with large Greek holdings.  Market volatility could remain high as traders react to headlines and attempt to gauge the commitment of governments and institutions as they work to prevent a Greek default. U.S. equities have been highly sensitive to Europe’s debt issues in recent weeks.  “If there was no resolution, that would create a capital hole which would put more pressure on the global financial system and make things worse here,” Polley said.  The S&P has gained 3.4 percent so far this week, after losing 6.5 percent on European-led fears the previous week. That week was also the Dow’s worst since October 2008 during the thick of the financial crisis.  Stocks also got a boost as investors rebalanced their portfolios in the last days of the quarter. The wide gap in performance between equities and bonds, favoring government debt so far this quarter, may partly reverse.  “All these end-of-quarter issues are amplifying the moves that we’ve been seeing in stocks,” said Paul Simon, chief investment officer at Tactical Allocation Group in Birmingham, Michigan. “I don’t have a lot of faith in the moves we’ve been seeing.”  Accenture Plc, a tech services company, rose 3.5 percent to $55.55 in extended trading after the market’s close and it reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations. The company gave a 2012 outlook that topped consensus forecasts.  Payroll processor Paychex Inc rose 1.9 percent to $27.20 after the closing bell following stronger-than-expected earnings.  U.S.-listed shares of Research in Motion surged on market speculation that investor Carl Icahn had taken a stake in the BlackBerry maker. The stock was one of the top gainers in the Nasdaq 100, climbing 4.5 percent to $22.65.  Walgreen Co fell 6.3 percent to $33.77 after it signaled that it wouldn’t budge in its battle with Express Scripts Inc over what the pharmacy benefits manager will pay for prescriptions. Express Scripts rose 0.9 percent to $39.68.  Almost five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, while about 73 percent of Nasdaq issues ended in positive territory. About 9.04 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, above last year’s daily average of 8.47 billion.

18,ACN,"Accenture growth momentum continues, upbeat on Q2","(Reuters) - Accenture Plc (ACN.N) reported first-quarter results that beat market estimates and forecast strong second-quarter revenue as demand for outsourced services grew amid a weak economy. With the European debt crisis and the slowdown in the U.S. economy depressing markets, many firms are looking at cost-saving measures to navigate the weak demand environment. For Accenture, which is in the business of cutting costs by providing cheap services through its offshore operations in countries like India and the Philippines, demand has never been so good. Outsourcing net revenues rose 21 percent to $3.0 billion, and contributed 42 percent to total revenue. New bookings — a key indicator of future sales — came in at $7.8 billion, up 23 percent. Peers like Cognizant (CTSH.O) and Infosys (INFY.NS) are also upbeat and are in fact looking to double their fortunes in credit crisis-hit Europe. The Grand Canal Harbour, Ireland-based company forecast second-quarter revenue of $6.5-$6.8 billion, largely above average analysts’ estimates of $6.59 billion, according to according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full-year it expects earnings of $3.76-$3.84 per share, on revenue growth of 7-10 percent, which translates to $27.29 billion-$28.05 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

20,ACN,Accenture sounds caution as economy sputters,"(Reuters) - Accenture Plc (ACN.N) posted strong quarterly results but the technology outsourcing and consulting company’s cautious view of the second quarter amid the worsening global economy sent its shares down after market. For the second quarter, the company forecast revenue of $6.5-$6.8 billion, a wider-than-usual range, to factor in any delays at the end of the calendar year, especially in the Euro zone. The global economic crisis is escalating, with a worsening euro-zone debt crisis and sluggish U.S. growth. The wide range of Accenture’s revenue forecast could mean that the macroeconomy is finally catching up with Accenture, Morningstar analyst Swami Shanmugasundaram told Reuters. “Typically, when you go into a quarter you have good visibility, and that’s why you have a tight range, but it looks like they don’t have too much in the pipeline like it was before,” he said. Chief Financial Officer Pamela Craig said on a post-earnings call that she does not see budgets go up very much but also does not hear about them going down. “When you think about places like the Eurozone, the UK and Japan ... we do have some work to do to replenish the pipeline. So we’re just kind of trying to take all that into account,” Craig said. The company also cut its earnings forecast for the fiscal year by 4 cents to $3.76-$3.84 per share, to reflect foreign exchange fluctuations. Analyst Shanmugasundaram said companies are taking longer to sanction projects, leading to longer sales cycles, and that bookings, at best, are expected to remain flat from the first quarter.

24,ACN,McDowell singing Match Play blues despite six birdies,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Former U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell once again found himself on the wrong side of the vagaries of golf at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship when he lost to Yang Yong-eun 2&1 on Wednesday. Northern Irishman McDowell recorded six birdies in dazzling sunshine at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club but he ran into a human buzz-saw as he was trumped by a red-hot Yang in the opening round. The South Korean, who beat McDowell in the third round here last year, birdied four of the first seven holes before sealing victory with his seventh birdie of the day at the par-four 17th. “You just run into the wrong guy on the wrong day, and you have got your work cut out. I didn’t take care of business, so I’m disappointed, yeah,” a frustrated McDowell told reporters. “He beat me last year and he seems to have my number a little bit, you know. I have a tendency to bring out the best in guys around this track for some reason.” McDowell, who clinched his first major title at the 2010 U.S. Open, has won only three matches in five appearances at the World Golf Championships event, a statistic that boggles his mind. “I have played better than that every year I have been here, but that’s just the way the cookie crumbles with this tournament,” the 32-year-old said. “It’s a strange feeling packing your clubs at 11:05 a.m. on a Wednesday morning having made six birdies. I love this resort ... but this golf course has not been good to me. It just doesn’t inspire me to make a ton of birdies.” McDowell felt the turning point in his match came at the par-four seventh where Yang, winner of the 2009 PGA Championship, rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt and the Briton then missed his attempt from eight feet. “Then I kind of miss it in the wrong place on nine, and I lose that,” the Northern Irishman added. “So from being all flat, I was two down. “But you know what? This is the start of a great run of golf for me. I’m very happy where my game is at. I made some great clutch putts out there today. “This just gives you nothing, this tournament, if you run into the wrong guy.” ",2222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-mcdowell/mcdowell-singing-match-play-blues-despite-six-birdies-idUSTRE81L26L20120222
25,ACN,"Mahan and Johnson cruise, Tiger toils","MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - While Tiger Woods was toiling in his match, fellow Americans Hunter Mahan and Dustin Johnson eased into the third round of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship with commanding victories on Thursday. Mahan became the first player to advance, crushing South Korean Yang Yong-eun 5&3, and Johnson followed with a 7&5 demolition of Italy’s Francesco Molinari at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club. Three-times champion Woods, however, was one down to fellow American Nick Watney after 16 holes in his bid for a first PGA Tour victory in over two years. British world number three Lee Westwood reached the third round for the first time in 12 appearances at the event, beating Swede Robert Karlsson 3&2, and fourth-ranked German Martin Kaymer edged past American David Toms two up. In blazing desert sunshine, Mahan birdied six of the first eight holes to go four up on Yang and recovered from bogeys at the ninth and 10th to seal the win on the 15th green. “I was playing as well as I could, hitting fairways and greens, giving myself good looks,” Mahan told reporters after carding seven birdies and three bogeys. “If you hit it good around here where these pins are and you get on the right level, you are going to have some putts, you are going to be able to make some putts. Today I was able to do that.” Johnson, who needed 20 holes to scrape past compatriot Jim Furyk in the opening round, never let up after seizing control against Molinari with four birdies in the first eight holes. The match ended at the par-five 13th where the Italian parred and the big-hitting Johnson was just 10 feet from the hole in two shots. “That momentum (from Wednesday) kind of carried over to today,” Johnson said. “I got off to a good start and just played really solidly today.” American Steve Stricker, champion in 2001 when the event was held in Australia, won a tight encounter with South African Louis Oosthuizen one up after sinking a 20-foot birdie putt at the par-four 18th. John Senden, who putted well on Dove Mountain’s tricky greens, upset fellow Australian Jason Day, the world number seven, 6&5. “I had the pressure on him early,” said Senden, who birdied two of the first four holes to go two up. “Then from there I wanted to keep focused and keep the quality of shots going on. “And then I did that. And he sort of made the mistakes to force the match to go further and further my way.” In other matches, Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of South Africa lost to South Korea’s Bae Sang-moon one-down and second-ranked Northern Irishman Rory Mcllroy was three up on Dane Anders Hansen after 14 holes.

26,ACN,"Westwood advances at Match Play, Kaymer exits","MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Lee Westwood reached the last eight for the first time at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship while Germany’s Martin Kaymer became the biggest casualty in Friday’s third round. World number three Westwood never trailed on his way to a 3&2 victory over American Nick Watney but Kaymer, beaten by Luke Donald in last year’s final, was ousted 4&3 by American Matt Kuchar at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club. Hunter Mahan completed another upset when he stunned U.S. Ryder Cup team mate and world number five Steve Stricker 4&3 after a sizzling display in the Sonoran desert and Swede Peter Hanson advanced with a 5&3 win over American Brandt Snedeker. Kuchar became the first player to reach the quarter-finals, coming from one down after three holes with a rock-solid performance as Kaymer perpetually struggled on the tricky, heavily contoured greens at Dove Mountain. “Matt played very consistently,” Kaymer told reporters. “He didn’t make any mistake really, but I made a few today unfortunately. “I hit a lot of good quality golf shots today, especially the first nine. I didn’t miss any golf shots really, but I just couldn’t make the putts.” World number 14 Kuchar struck his tee shot to within two feet of the cup at the par-three sixth for a conceded birdie to go one up before his lead was doubled when Kaymer three-putted from six feet to bogey the par-five eighth. The consistent American then birdied the 10th and 11th to go four up before sealing the win with a matching par on the 15th green. In-form Mahan piled up nine birdies in dazzling sunshine, the last of them conceded by Stricker from just two feet at the driveable par-four 15th to end their third-round encounter. “I felt good with my game,” said Mahan, who will face Kuchar in Saturday morning’s quarter-finals. “Irons, driving, everything, putting, chipping ... I just had a lot of confidence in it. “Boy, it’s nice to get off to a good start and get ahead early. I just played solid from there and made a nice little bomb on 12,” the American said of his 50-foot birdie putt at the par-three hole. “That was a momentum changer.” American Mark Wilson reached the last eight for the first time with a 4&3 victory over big-hitting compatriot Dustin Johnson and Martin Laird beat 1999 British Open champion Paul Lawrie 3&1 in all-Scotland encounter. In other matches, Northern Irish world number two Rory McIlroy was two up on Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez after 13 holes while South Korea’s Bae Sang-moon was all square with Australian John Senden after 12.

27,ACN,McIlroy and Westwood to meet in semi-finals,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy and Lee Westwood set up a mouth-watering duel in the last four of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship when they each completed comfortable victories in Saturday’s quarter-finals. Northern Ireland’s world number two McIlroy never trailed before beating South Korean Bae Sang-moon 3&2 while third-ranked Westwood won 4&2 against fellow Briton Martin Laird at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club. Either McIlroy or Westwood can depose Luke Donald as world number one by winning Sunday’s final, adding extra spice to their semi-final encounter on Sunday morning. “This is why we practise, this is why we work so hard,” McIlroy told reporters after reaching his first Match Play semi-final in four appearances. “You want to try to beat the best. “I’ll really enjoy out there tomorrow morning battling away and obviously trying to beat Lee. It’s the match that most people wanted and definitely the match that I wanted.” Earlier on Saturday, Hunter Mahan crushed fellow American Matt Kuchar 6&5 in their quarter-final and will meet compatriot Mark Wilson, a 4&3 winner over Swede Peter Hanson. McIlroy, at 22 aiming to become the youngest ever Match Play champion, piled up six birdies to keep continual pressure on Bae, who had ousted 2010 winner Ian Poulter and Masters champion Charl Schwartzel in earlier rounds. “I don’t think Moon had his best with him today,” McIlroy said after a breezy, sun-splashed day at Dove Mountain. “I felt like I played pretty well. I played solid golf and did what I had to do. I’m just very happy to be through.” Westwood, who had never reached the third round in his 11 previous appearances at the event, was delighted to be in contention for one of the game’s biggest titles. “My priorities this year were to win major championships and World Golf Championships because I haven’t ever won any,” the 38-year-old Englishman said. “You want to win the big tournaments where the best players are playing, and I’ve given myself a great chance early in the year to do that.” Westwood, who had never trailed in his previous three matches this week, was one down after five holes before winning four of the next five to take control. “I played solidly,” said the Briton, a winner of 21 events on the European Tour and long established as one of the game’s best players. “I didn’t make a bogey. “Martin gave me (conceded) a couple of birdies and I made three others. Five under par is solid golf.” Mahan became the first player to reach the last four, making four birdies in six holes to end his match against an error-prone Kuchar at the par-five 13th. “Today the course is playing tougher, I didn’t make as many birdies,” Mahan said after recording the largest margin of victory in the quarter-finals. “Matt didn’t play as well as he can or usually does. It made it easier to win a few holes with par. I played solid, didn’t make any bogeys ... and I kept the pressure on him.” In the top match, Hanson bogeyed the opening hole to trail for the first time this week and though he got back to all square by the turn he began to unravel as he bogeyed 10 and 11. Rock-steady Wilson won the par-five 13th with a birdie, after deftly chipping from just short of the green to three feet, and the 14th, where Hanson bogeyed, to go four up. “It was nice to hole about a 10-footer to win the match on 15 after he was in with birdie,” Wilson said after reaching the semi-finals for the first time.

28,ACN,American Mahan upsets McIlroy to win Match Play,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - American Hunter Mahan clinched his fourth PGA Tour title with a 2&1 victory over world number two Rory McIlroy in Sunday’s final of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. With McIlroy initially failing to replicate the stunning form he produced earlier in the day on the way to a 3&1 semi-final win over third-ranked Briton Lee Westwood, Mahan took advantage with a seven-birdie display. The 29-year-old never trailed after going ahead at the par-three sixth, and he fended off a McIlroy fightback after the turn, ending the match with a comfortable two-putt par on the 17th green. Northern Irishman McIlroy, like Mahan appearing in his first Match Play final, would have replaced Britain’s Luke Donald as world number one when the rankings are issued on Monday had he claimed his first WGC crown. “It wasn’t the best of starts,” McIlroy said greenside. “Six, seven and eight were the turning point - Hunter won three holes in a row there. “I was trying to claw my way back, but I left myself with too much work to do.” Mahan, ranked 22nd in the world, added a second World Golf Championships (WGC) title to his resume, having previously won the 2010 Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone. In dazzling afternoon sunshine, both players bogeyed the opening hole, Mahan after duffing a chip from behind the green and McIlroy when he lipped out from four feet. The next two holes were halved with matching birdies and McIlroy was fortunate not to go one down at the par-four fourth where he had to take a penalty drop after his tee shot ended up in desert scrub. He bogeyed the hole, as did Mahan who struck his approach into the front left greenside bunker after being perfectly placed off the tee. Mahan finally broke the deadlock to go one up with a conceded birdie at the sixth where he struck an exquisite tee shot that settled within two feet of the cup. The American then benefited from a poor matchplay decision by McIlroy at the par-four seventh. After watching Mahan’s approach from 135 yards pitch on and then spin back down the hill below the green, McIlroy followed suit and then failed to reach the green with his chip. While Mahan bogeyed the hole, he went two up after the Northern Irishman missed a 10-footer to double-bogey. McIlroy was again in trouble at the par-five eighth, finding a bunker off the tee, failing to reach the green in three and then lipping out with an eight-foot par putt to go three down. Mahan went four up after nearly holing out from the fairway with a 180-yard approach at the par-four 10th, his ball finishing two feet past the cup for a conceded birdie. Though McIlroy chipped in to eagle the par-five 11th and also birdied the par-four 14th to trim Mahan’s lead to two-up, the American held him off over the next three holes.

And I needed everything to win. I’m very proud of how I played,” added Mahan who totalled 35 birdies during the week from 96 holes. World number two McIlroy, like Mahan appearing in his first Match Play final, would have replaced Britain’s Luke Donald as the game’s leading player when the rankings are issued on Monday had he claimed his first WGC crown. “Deep down I wanted to postpone that crowning of the No. 1 player in the world for Rory,” Mahan said with a grin. “But he’ll be No. 1 eventually. I’m not worried about it, I’m sure he’s not.” U.S. Open champion McIlroy applauded Mahan’s performance, but conceded that his hugely anticipated morning semi-final against Westwood had sapped some of his energy. “Maybe mentally and emotionally it did take a little bit out of me but it still doesn’t take away from the fact that Hunter played very, very solid golf,” the 22-year-old said. “Even though I threw a few birdies and an eagle at him on the back nine, he still responded well and held on. During the course of the week, he played the best golf and deserved to win.” In dazzling afternoon sunshine at Dove Mountain, both players bogeyed the opening hole, Mahan after duffing a chip from behind the green and McIlroy when he lipped out from four feet.

30,ACN,Donald regains No. 1 ranking,"(Reuters) - Englishman Luke Donald regained the number one ranking from Rory McIlroy when he won the Transitions Championship at Palm Harbor, Florida on Sunday. Donald clinched the tournament after he won a sudden-death playoff with South Korean Bae Sang-moon and the American pair of Robert Garrigus and Jim Furyk. The four finished the event locked at 13-under-par, just one stroke clear of another group of four players, on a heavily congested leaderboard. Donald, who had closed with a bogey-free round of five-under 66, won on the first playoff hole when he drained a birdie putt from less than seven feet after a brilliant approach shot from around 157 yards out of the rough. The win provided the 34-year-old with his fifth victory on the PGA Tour and elevated him back to the top of the world rankings. Donald had been number one until he was passed by McIlroy two weeks ago. South African Ernie Els led the event for most of the final day before making bogey on each of the last two holes to miss out on the playoff by a shot.

31,ACN,"Resilient Europe, strong U.S. boosts Accenture profit","(Reuters) - Accenture Plc’s (ACN.N) quarterly profit beat Wall Street expectations for the eighth straight quarter, as the technology outsourcing and consultancy company held on to growth in its European business, bucking the trend indicated by rivals. Last month, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O) said it does not expect Europe to rebound in 2012. Earlier, Indian rival Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) INFY.O had warned of lower client spending due to the euro zone debt crisis. Both the companies get about a fifth of their revenue from Europe, while the region accounts for nearly 40 percent of Accenture’s business. There are early signs of improvement in the U.S. economy and progress to stabilize the euro zone, Chief Executive Pierre Nanterme said on a conference call. “In technology outsourcing, we see increasing demand across all geographies, including continued strength in Europe, as clients continue to reduce their IT operating costs,” Chief Financial Officer Pamela Craig said. Third-quarter revenue from Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 8 percent to $2.8 billion. Revenue from the Americas grew 13 percent to $3 billion. Dublin-based Accenture raised its full-year outlook and now expects a profit between $3.82 and $3.90 per share. It had previously forecast a profit of $3.76 to $3.84 a share. The company also raised its revenue growth forecast to between 10 percent and 12 percent from 7 percent to 10 percent, in local currency. It expects new bookings — a key indicator of future sales — for 2012 to be in the upper half of its previously forecast range of $28 billion to $31 billion, it said in a statement. December-February net income rose to $714.2 million, or 97 cents per share, from $565.8 million, or 75 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 12 percent to $6.8 billion. “The numbers look good, they came out at the high end of their revenue target range,” Morningstar analyst Swami Shanmugasundaram said before the call. New bookings totaled $7.94 billion for the second quarter, up 14 percent from the year-ago period and nearly 2 percent sequentially. Shares of Accenture rose 1.5 percent to $64.70 in trading after the bell. They closed at $63.75 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock touched a life-high of $64.26 on Wednesday after a near-three-month rally.

35,ACN,American Mahan wins Houston Open by one shot,"(Reuters) - American Hunter Mahan became the first golfer to record multiple wins on the PGA Tour this year by claiming a one-stroke victory over Sweden’s Carl Pettersson at the Houston Open in Humble, Texas, on Sunday. Mahan, who won the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in February, shot a one-under-par 71 in Sunday’s final round at Redstone for a 16-under-par total of 272. “I feel great. I had the lead for most of the back nine and hit some clutch shots, especially on 18. It feels great,” Mahan said after claiming his fifth career victory on the PGA Tour. Mahan, 29, said the victory boosted his confidence and that he was looking forward to a chance at capturing his first major championship at the April 5-8 Masters at Augusta National. “I’m playing good. I’m glad I’m going to Augusta, it’s really a special place and I’m looking forward to going there.” Pettersson, who held the lead before a two-shot swing in the middle of the round put Mahan back on top of the leaderboard, also posted a 71 for 273. Former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa began the day with a two-stroke lead but double-bogeyed the fifth and eighth holes to slide back. Oosthuizen, who romped to a seven-stroke victory at the 2010 British Open, got back on track on the back nine with three birdies to complete a 75 and finish third at 274. Tied for fourth place at 14-under 276 were Americans Phil Mickelson (71), Keegan Bradley (71) and Jeff Overton (68) along with Briton Brian Davis (74). Pettersson used a birdie at the first and another at the fourth hole to move into the lead as Oosthuizen struggled. But the burly Swede bogeyed the 10th as Mahan ended a string of eight successive pars with a birdie at the ninth to take the lead. Mahan added a stroke to his advantage with another birdie at the 10th. Mahan, who stood second after three rounds, gave back a stroke with a bogey at the par-three 14th, but held his nerve down the stretch. Holding the one-shot lead, the American hit a perfect drive at the 488-yard par-four 18th and striped a seven-iron on a line just past the pin and two-putted for victory.

36,ACN,South African Oosthuizen takes Houston control,"(Reuters) - Former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen birdied five of the last seven holes to charge two shots clear in the third round of the weather-delayed Houston Open in Humble, Texas on Saturday. The smooth-swinging South African recovered from bogeys on the first two holes to card a six-under-par 66 at the rain-softened Redstone Golf Club in the final PGA Tour event before next week’s Masters. Oosthuizen, who romped to a seven-stroke victory at the 2010 British Open, launched his late surge with four consecutive birdies from the 12th to post a 17-under total of 199. American Hunter Mahan was alone in second place after carding a 65, with Swede Carl Pettersson (67) and Britain’s Brian Davis (69) a further stroke back at 14 under. For the second round in a row at Redstone, players were permitted to lift, clean and replace their balls on a course that had been saturated by more than an inch of rain on Thursday. “I had to compose myself,” Oosthuizen told reporters, referring to his bogey-bogey start. “Other than that, I hit it well and started making a few putts on the back nine. “I was driving it well, my iron play the whole week has been really good and I just made some good putts today. “The greens here are really fast, which I enjoy. If it’s not windy here, you feel like there are a lot of birdies out there.” Asked how he would approach Sunday’s final round, Oostuizen replied with a smile: “Pretty much the same as today, try and not start bogey-bogey. “It’s always a good opportunity going in with a lead. I think it’s going to be good fun tomorrow.” Defending champion Phil Mickelson was among a group of three players tied for sixth at 11 under after shooting a three-birdie 70. Three-times major winner Ernie Els, who needs to win the Houston Open to qualify for next week’s Masters, was at eight-under 209 after shooting a second successive 69. “I’ve just got to stick to what I’m doing,” said the South African former world number one. “I’m playing really well. “Obviously, I would love to get a win. I’d like to play a solid round of golf tomorrow. If it really gets going, that will be really a plus.” Earlier in the day, American Jeff Maggert birdied three of his last eight holes to grab a one-shot lead when the weather-delayed second round was finally completed at Redstone to get the tournament back on track. The 48-year-old went on to shoot 76 in the third round to finish a long day tied for 14th at eight under par. Maggert, a three-times winner on the PGA Tour, is playing his ninth and final event this year on a major medical exemption following shoulder surgery and needs $202,609 to retain his status for next season.

Nokia moved 3,000 worldwide staff and development work for its Symbian platform to Accenture last year after it overhauled its smartphone strategy and adopted Microsoft software.

Sales of Symbian smartphones have sunk faster than Nokia and markets have expected over last few quarters, pushing Nokia into losses and raising questions over its future direction. “While Windows Phone is our primary smartphone platform, we will continue to support Symbian until 2016.

40,ACN,TEXT-S&P; summary: Accenture PLC,"With annual revenues in excess of $29 billion, Accenture’s “strong” business 	 profile is attributable to its recognized leadership in consulting and IT 	 services, and its established client relationships with the largest global 	 corporations. Growth in new contract signings was strong in the first half of 	 fiscal 2012 across Accenture’s operating groups and geographic regions. 	 Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services expects continuing strength in Accenture’s 	 outsourcing business-primarily focused on business transformation and 	 application outsourcing-to offset the potential for greater volatility in 	 consulting and system integration revenues. Outsourcing revenues, which 	 represent about 42% of net revenue, enhance visibility through contractually 	 recurring revenues. The company’s focus on higher end services, a highly 	 variable cost base, and moderate capital intensity has allowed it to maintain 	 solid adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-teen area. Accenture has maintained a strong balance sheet, with negligible funded debt 	 levels. Adjusted (for capitalized operating leases and post-retirement 	 obligations) debt to EBITDA was 0.4x as of February 2012, and is expected to 	 remain below 1x. The current rating and outlook incorporate the expectation of 	 modest acquisition activity, and ongoing net share repurchases funded by 	 discretionary cash flow. Liquidity Accenture has “strong” liquidity, with sources of cash likely to substantially 	 exceed uses for the next 12 to 24 months. Cash sources include cash and 	 short-term investment balances in excess of $5 billion as of Feb. 29, 2012, 	 and expected annual free operating cash flow (FOCF) in excess of $2.5 billion. 	 We expect near-term uses to include capital expenditures of about $450 	 million, and annual dividends of about $950 million. Relevant aspects of Accenture’s liquidity, in our view, are as follows: — We see coverage of uses to be in excess of 2x for the next two years, 	 in part reflecting minimal debt maturities. — We expect that net sources would be positive in the near term, even 	 with a 30% decline in EBITDA from fiscal 2011 levels. — Potential acquisitions are likely to be moderate in size and not 	 materially impact Accenture’s leverage profile. — Additional liquidity is provided by availability under Accenture’s $1 	 billion credit facility, expiring in October 2016. — Shareholder returns are supported by consistently strong FOCF. Outlook The outlook is stable, reflecting our expectation that Accenture will maintain 	 its solid operating performance, will generate growth primarily organically, 	 and will continue to manage credit protection measures at levels that are 	 strong for the rating. Highly competitive industry conditions and a business 	 profile somewhat narrower than its major competitors limit a possible upgrade. 	 Erosion of the company’s business position and profitability, or sustained 	 leverage approaching 1.5x because of acquisitions or aggressive share 	 repurchase activity, could lead to a negative rating action.

46,ACN,Americans less fearful than most about retirement savings,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A global survey has found that most people around the world are worried about their financial health after retirement, but that Americans are the least pessimistic. Accenture, a global technology and consulting firm, found that about just 16 percent of respondents, are confident that their rate of retirement savings will be enough to cover their post-retirement needs. The March survey included 8,112 respondents between 25 and 60 years old in 15 countries on four continents. Accenture Life Insurance Services, a business service within Accenture’s Financial Services operating group, funded the telephone survey. The group provides advice to more than 60 life insurance, annuity and pension clients worldwide. The firm found that more than four out of five people, or 82 percent of respondents, were worried about their financial situation after retirement and that almost nine in 10 people, or 89 percent, believed it is important for them to start saving immediately. By comparison, roughly one in five Americans, more than the global average of 16 percent, said they were confident about their rate of savings for retirement. Americans were also more optimistic than most about their general post-retirement financial situation, with 70 percent of respondents saying they were worried compared to the global average of 82 percent. “I think the U.S. may have been one of the first countries to feel like they’ve moved on from the financial crisis (of 2008), and some others are perhaps continually feeling more impacted,” said Mark Halverson, a managing director in Accenture’s Financial Services Group. Others view Americans’ optimism regarding retirement as a key behavioral problem that is increasing the risk of retirees outliving their savings, since they may be underestimating their life span. “The new behavioral issue that’s really starting to unfold is: people don’t fear living too long, they fear dying too soon,” said Mark Fortier, head of product and partner strategy at AllianceBernstein Defined Contribution Investments. “We perversely see the positive outcome of not living a long time, which is a bittersweet irony of these surveys,” Fortier added.

48,ACN,Accenture bets on outsourcing business to drive growth,"(Reuters) - Accenture Plc forecast full-year earnings ahead of analyst estimates as it bolsters its outsourcing business to offset a slowdown in consulting, sending its shares up 5 percent in after-market trading. Outsourcing revenue rose 10 percent to $3.1 billion while consulting revenue fell 4 percent to $3.74 billion in the fourth quarter. Accenture, which has about 257,000 employees worldwide, expects revenue growth in its outsourcing business to continue to outpace that of consulting, Chief Financial Officer Pamela Craig said on a conference call. “They’re clearly gaining market share ... Outsourcing would be a bigger part of the business going forward,” Barclays Capital analyst Darrin Peller said. The company, which competes with Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp and Infosys Ltd, expects earnings of $4.22 to $4.30 per share in fiscal 2013. Analysts on average were expecting $4.15 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Accenture targets new bookings, a key indicator of future sales, in the range of $31 billion to $34 billion in fiscal 2013.

Outsourcing revenue rose 10 percent to $3.1 billion while consulting revenue fell 4 percent to $3.74 billion in the fourth quarter. Accenture, which has about 257,000 employees worldwide, expects revenue growth in its outsourcing business to continue to outpace that of consulting, Chief Financial Officer Pamela Craig said on a conference call. “They’re clearly gaining market share ... Outsourcing would be a bigger part of the business going forward,” Barclays Capital analyst Darrin Peller said. The company, which competes with Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp and Infosys Ltd, expects earnings of $4.22 to $4.30 per share in fiscal 2013. Analysts on average were expecting $4.15 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

52,ACN,Accenture buys Nokia Siemens IPTV assets,"(Reuters) - Consulting and outsourcing group Accenture has bought some internet protocol television (IPTV) assets from Nokia Siemens Networks to bolster its online video capabilities, it said on Monday. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Accenture said the newly acquired IPTV software, assets and capabilities would be part of its video solutions business that helps companies launch video services at a low cost. Internet protocol television uses the same technology that powers the Internet to transmit multimedia content over telecom and cable networks. A source close to the deal said 17 employees of Nokia Siemens would join Accenture. Belgacom said in June it planned to acquire certain IPTV assets and rights from Nokia Siemens Networks, as well as approximately 25 personnel. That deal is yet to close. The two deals will mark an exit from the IPTV business for Nokia Siemens Networks, a 50-50 joint venture between Nokia Oyj and Siemens AG, which is in the middle of a cost-cutting plan that includes laying off a quarter of its staff and selling product lines to focus on mobile broadband. The venture is in talks to sell its business support systems unit, which provides billing and charging systems for telecoms operators. Accenture shares were up 8 cents at $70.11 on the Nasdaq on Monday. The stock touched an all-time high of $70.97 earlier in the session. Nokia’s U.S. traded shares were 17 cents higher at $2.74.

55,ACN,TEXT-Fitch affirms Accenture's IDR at 'A+';outlook stable,"Nov 20 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Accenture plc (Accenture) and subsidiaries as follows: Accenture —Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘A+’. Accenture International Capital SCA —Long-term IDR at ‘A+’; —Senior unsecured bank credit facility at ‘A+’. Accenture Capital Inc. —Long-term IDR at ‘A+’; —Senior unsecured bank credit facility at ‘A+’. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Approximately $1 billion of debt, consisting of an  undrawn credit facility, is affected by Fitch’s action. The Ratings and Outlook are supported by Accenture’s: —Strong balance sheet with negligible debt; —Solid liquidity supported by significant and consistent free cash flow (FCF;  about $2 billion plus), despite cyclical demand associated with the consulting  and systems integration (C&SI;) business. Fitch projects $2.5 - $3 billion of  free cash flow (post dividends) in fiscal 2013 compared with $2.9 billion in  fiscal 2012; —Revenue stability from established, long-term client relationships and  industry expertise, resulting in a significant percentage of new contracts  awarded on a sole-sourced basis; —Strong market position in targeted IT service groups with solid projected  long-term market growth rates, especially application and business process  outsourcing, supported by the company’s significant and diversified offshore  delivery capability; —Recurring revenue provided by longer-term outsourcing contracts (nearly 44% of  net revenue) and less capital-intensive business model relative to its peers; —Diversified revenue base from a customer, industry, geography and service line  offering perspective. Ratings concerns center on: —Potential for sizable debt-funded share repurchases and/or acquisitions.  However, Fitch believes Accenture has considerable financial flexibility at the  current rating due to its strong balance sheet and consistent FCF. —Pricing pressures due to intense competition from multinational, offshore  (primarily India-based) and niche IT Services providers. —Long-term effect of software as a service (SaaS) adoption on demand for  traditional systems integration services, particularly enterprise resource  planning software. Fitch believes total IT services revenue generated from SaaS  will likely be less than traditional software implementations over the  software’s entire life cycle, despite initial revenue from integrating SaaS into  a client’s existing systems. —Threat of new market entrants in the traditional outsourcing market due to  increasing adoption of cloud computing. As of Aug. 31, 2012, Accenture’s liquidity was strong, consisting of $6.6  billion of cash and investments, an undrawn $1 billion revolving line of credit  maturing 2016 and $2.9 billion of FCF in the latest 12 months. The credit  facility agreement requires the company to maintain a consolidated leverage  ratio (debt/EBITDA) of less than 1.75 times (x). Fitch believes the company maintains greater flexibility in accessing its cash  due to certain structural considerations taken as part of the 2001  reorganization that continue with Accenture’s reincorporation in Ireland. Fitch  anticipates free cash flow remaining after cash dividends will continue to be  utilized primarily for share repurchases and acquisitions. As of Aug. 31, 2012, Accenture had negligible outstanding debt as the company  generates ample cash flow to internally fund share repurchases, cash dividends  and relatively modest acquisition activity to date. Total debt was less than  $0.1 million on Aug. 31, 2011 compared with $4.4 million in the prior year. The company does have off-balance sheet debt in the form of significant  operating lease commitments since it does not own any of its real estate as part  of its ‘asset-light’ strategy. In the past five fiscal years, Fitch estimates  total adjusted debt to EBITDAR ranged from 0.9x - 1x and was 0.9x in the fiscal  year ended Aug. 31, 2012. Negative: Future developments that may lead to a negative rating action include: —Significant debt-financed acquisitions and/or share repurchases that result in  a material deterioration in credit protection measures. Positive: Upside movement in the ratings is unlikely in the near term.",11202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWLB091120121120
56,ACN,SocGen considers outsourcing 400 jobs,"PARIS (Reuters) - Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), France’s No. 2 listed bank by value, is considering outsourcing 400 back-office jobs at its corporate and investment bank, according to internal memos seen by Reuters. The plan, in which consulting company Accenture (ACN.N) would take on staff working mainly in custody and securities services, could be extended to other businesses, such as broader financing, the memos drafted by management and unions showed. “(It is) a project to transfer 400 jobs ... Accenture is asking that the transfer be mandatory,” one memo drafted by the CGT union said, adding that cost savings had been estimated at 90-160 million euros ($115-205 million). Investment banks across the world, including Switzerland’s UBS UBSN.VX and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), are cutting jobs and overhauling business models to adapt to tougher regulations and the economic slowdown. “There is a competitive advantage in pooling together investments,” said a memo drafted by SocGen management to present its new plan. “We need to be the drivers because if we don’t act, our competitors will.” A SocGen spokesman said the bank was looking at a project with “an outside partner” to create a European back-office custody business that would offer services to rival banks. He would not confirm the number of jobs affected, nor the possibility of expanding the remit of the plan. The news was reported earlier by French investment newsletter L’Agefi. If it goes ahead, the move will take effect in July, a union source told Reuters. Another French bank is interested in taking part in the Accenture project, and 25 banks in total are being approached to join, the source added. Five of the biggest staff unions at SocGen have called for a strike on January 8 to protest against the threat of job cuts and salary freezes at the bank. SocGen has spent the past year cutting costs and staff to slim down its balance sheet and replenish capital amid the grinding pain of the euro zone debt crisis. It said on November 8 that it had completed its plan to reshape its investment bank, but it warned that the outlook for 2013 remained murky.

59,ACN,Firms swapping euro zone for emerging markets: survey,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nearly one in two companies have already reduced their exposure to the euro zone because of the bloc’s debt and banking problems, according to a study released on Tuesday by Accenture. But the consulting firm also found that half of euro zone businesses are looking to take advantage of the crisis by seeking acquisitions in the 17-currency area. For Chinese companies, that figure rises to 71 percent. Accenture surveyed 450 companies, 96 percent of which have annual revenues of at least $1 billion. Of those firms polled, 46 percent said they were moving production or supply chain activities outside the euro zone. This includes 10 percent that may quit the bloc altogether. Accenture found 44 percent of firms have accelerated investments in high-growth emerging markets. At the same time, nearly 60 percent of German and Spanish respondents to the survey have already started, or will soon begin, to seek acquisitions in the euro zone. “It is inevitable that slow growth and uncertainty in Europe will make investment to emerging markets look attractive,” said Mark Spelman, Accenture’s managing director for strategy. “But the euro zone remains a good long term bet and a significant number of high-performing companies see opportunities for organic and inorganic growth,” he said in a statement.

61,ACN,"Accenture forecast misses Wall Street estimates, shares fall","(Reuters) - Accenture Plc’s (ACN.N) second-quarter forecast disappointed investors as the outsourcing and consulting company’s clients deferred discretionary spending in Europe, sending its shares down 5 percent in after-market trade. Accenture forecast second-quarter revenue of between $6.9 billion and $7.15 billion. Analysts on average had estimated $7.14 billion.

EMEA accounted for nearly 41 percent of Accenture’s revenue last fiscal.

65,ACN,Golf: Players prepare for the lottery of Match Play,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - For the players, the self-directed questions can be endless as they steel themselves for the sheer lottery of the one-on-one format in this week’s WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship at Dove Mountain. How many days will they last? Will their golf be good enough to win in Wednesday’s opening round? Can they still advance after a slightly off-day? Will the putts drop at the right time? “When I was packing my bags the other night, I’m thinking, ‘How many shirts did I bring? How many pairs of pants?’ This is always a fun event,” world number one Rory McIlroy told reporters on a sunny, breezy day at Dove Mountain on Tuesday. “It’s one of those weeks where you’ve just got to try and get through every round, and you face different opposition every day. I’m looking forward to it. I love the golf course here. “It’s a great course for match play. You can be really aggressive and make a lot of birdies,” added Northern Ireland’s McIlroy, who has been drawn to play Irishman Shane Lowry in Wednesday’s opening round. Matchplay is much more unpredictable than strokeplay and because of the extraordinary depth in the global game, anyone in this week’s elite 64-man field is capable of winning the title. “There are no weak players in this tournament and no easy matches,” said Britain’s former world number one Lee Westwood, who did not reach the third round in his first 11 appearances at the event before getting to the semi-finals last year. “Very rarely do you get given one (a win) in this, and that’s the idea for tomorrow, just to try and turn up and play well. Hopefully it’s good enough. “And hopefully the guy doesn’t blitz it and hole everything and chip in and frustrate you like that. You do need a bit more luck in this event than in other ones.” Asked if he changed his strategy going into last year’s Match Play where he eventually lost 3&1 to McIlroy in the last four, Westwood replied: “Other than not really putting too much pressure on myself to try and get going in the tournament, no. “Just try to play carefree golf sort of and see what happened.” Tiger Woods is a three-times winner of the event but he has also suffered early disappointment, losing on the opening day in 2002 and 2011 and going out in the second round in 2005, 2009 and last year. “Anybody can beat anybody at this level,” said the former world number one. “That’s what makes it so interesting for us as players. It is a sprint, it is a boat race. You have to get off to quick starts. “Generally if you get down early, two or three down, you rarely come back. It’s hard to make up ground when you’re only playing 18 holes,” added Woods, who plays fellow American Charles Howell III in the first round. Hunter Mahan will be defending the title he won last year with a 2&1 victory over McIlroy in the final but he also knows the pain of losing in the opening round, having been eliminated by South African Charl Schwartzel at the first hurdle in 2010. “It’s a weird feeling,” American Mahan said of the long, uphill journey by van from the course back to the clubhouse after being ousted. “You just want to get out of there. “The van can’t move fast enough. People can’t get out of the way fast enough. Everything bothers you. And if someone asks you, ‘How was your day?’ you want to punch them in the face.” McIlroy, Woods, 2011 champion Luke Donald of Britain and South African Louis Oosthuizen are the top seeds in the four groups of 16 for this week’s event. World number three Donald will launch his campaign against Germany’s Marcel Siem while fifth-ranked South African Oosthuizen takes on Briton Richie Ramsay in the first round. For the fifth consecutive year, the elite event that brings together the world’s best players will be held on the 7,791-yard layout at Dove Mountain.

66,ACN,Refreshed McIlroy says swinging well with new clubs,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Four weeks after missing the cut in his first event with Nike golf clubs, Rory McIlroy is confident his game is in much better shape heading in6to this week’s WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship at Dove Mountain. The Northern Irishman has not competed since his premature exit from the European Tour’s Abu Dhabi Championship but said he was feeling refreshed after mixing some welcome holiday time with 10 days of practice sessions over the past month. “I’m actually much happier with how I’m swinging the club,” world number one McIlroy told reporters at Dove Mountain on Tuesday while preparing for Wednesday’s opening round. “The clubs were performing fine in Abu Dhabi, it was just the fact that I wasn’t swinging at my best. I feel like I’ve turned a corner with my swing. I’ve got it back on track, and that’s ultimately what’s going to help me play better.” Widely panned for switching his golf brand last month from Titleist to Nike in a lucrative deal reported to be worth as much as $250 million over 10 years, McIlroy said he now tried to blinker himself from criticism as much as possible. “At the start (of his career) I guess I paid a lot more attention to it, but now I try to not read anything or not watch anything because you don’t want any negative thoughts creeping into your head,” the 23-year-old added. “It’s part of what we do. We’re under the spotlight and we’re going to get criticized from time to time, rightfully or wrongfully so. That’s just the way it is. I’ve learnt that, and I’m dealing with it.” McIlroy, who has put a new putter and a slightly heavier driver in his bag, said he had prepared himself for likely criticism when his switch to Nike was announced with much fanfare before last month’s Abu Dhabi Championship. “I knew it would happen if I didn’t play well, and I probably put a little bit too much pressure on myself to play well because of that,” he smiled. “Abu Dhabi was a busy week. There was a lot going on. “But I’ve had a nice few weeks off and I feel like I’m coming into this event prepared, ready and swinging the club well. Hopefully that can translate into playing some good golf and getting quite far into this week.” Six-times major champion Nick Faldo was among those who criticized McIlroy for his switch from Titleist to Nike, telling Reuters it was “a dangerous move”. McIlroy responded: “Nick Faldo doesn’t know how I feel over the golf shot and I don’t know how he felt, but my guess is he was a little more analytically minded than I am. “I try and keep things as simple as possible. If I see the ball going in the direction that I want in the flight that I want, then I’m happy. It feels good, and hopefully I can show that to everyone this week.” McIlroy, who has been vacationing with his girlfriend, former world women’s tennis number one Caroline Wozniacki, in recent weeks, will take on a good friend, Ireland’s Shane Lowry, in the opening round at Dove Mountain. “We played foursomes together for Ireland,” McIlroy grinned. “We were part of the same Irish amateur team for a few years. “If we’d have thought playing in the European team championships at Western Gailes that we’d be playing in the first round of the Match Play here in a few years’ time ... it’s pretty cool to think where we’ve come from.” ",2192013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-mcilroy/refreshed-mcilroy-says-swinging-well-with-new-clubs-idUSBRE91I13Q20130219

Just over three-and-a-half hours of golf was possible on a bitterly cold and breezy morning before rain, sleet and then snow led to matches being suspended at the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event. Ice formed on the greens and, with further snow showers forecast for the rest of the day in Arizona’s high desert, officials called off play for the day after waiting a couple of hours to re-evaluate conditions. Almost two inches of snow covered the entire course, driving range and practice putting green at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club after all but 10 matches had started with none finishing. “Once we got two inches of snow, even if it melted in the next hour or so, it would still take another hour-and-a-half ... to let the golf course drain where we could play,” Mark Russell, the PGA Tour’s vice president of rules and competition, said. “We were just spinning our wheels, so we just decided to pull the plug on it. But I don’t think we’ll have any problem at all if the weather remains nice, finishing Sunday on time.” Officials later said the first round would resume, weather-permitting, from 8.30am local (10.30 a.m. ET) on Thursday with the second round scheduled to start from around noon. Ian Poulter, the 2010 champion, was 3up on fellow Briton Stephen Gallacher and summed up the feelings of most of his peers by tweeting: “Yes yes the greens are covered in snow in Arizona. Wow it was freezing out there.” Australian Jason Day was in full command against American Zach Johnson, four birdies in the first eight holes helping him go 6up after 10. “I’ve never played golf to the point where we’ve actually stopped for snow, which is kind of crazy,” a smiling Day told reporters. “But that’s just how it is. Mother Nature can just do whatever she wants. “Once it comes to tomorrow, I kind of have to get back into that game mode ... I do have that lead, but I want to make sure that I try and get in the house.” American Bo Van Pelt was 5up on Australian John Senden after 12 holes, defending champion Hunter Mahan was 4up on Italy’s Matteo Manassero after nine and American Matt Kuchar was 3up on Japan’s Hiroyuki Fujita after 14. Northern Ireland’s world number one Rory McIlroy, beaten by Mahan 2&1 in last year’s final, and three-times champion Tiger Woods were among those yet to start their first-round matches. McIlroy has been drawn to play Irishman Shane Lowry in the opening round while Woods will face fellow American Charles Howell III. It was the second time in three years that wintry weather had forced a delay in play at Dove Mountain. Almost an inch of snow covered the course before thawing out for the start of the 2011 final between Britain’s Luke Donald and Germany’s Martin Kaymer, which was later interrupted by sleet. Donald went on to win that final 3&2. It is the third PGA Tour event this year to be severely affected by adverse weather. The season-opening Tournament of Champions in Hawaii was cut to three rounds and spilled over into a rare Tuesday finish because of relentless howling winds and an entire day was wiped out by fog at last month’s Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego.

68,ACN,"Henley, Day and Sterne score upset wins","MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - PGA Tour rookie Russell Henley beat in-form South African Charl Schwartzel 1up to pull off the biggest early upset in the snow-delayed first round of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship on Thursday. The 23-year-old American, who clinched his maiden victory on the U.S. circuit at last month’s Sony Open, never trailed and held off a late fightback by the 2011 Masters champion with pars on the last three holes. Among the late starters, Northern Ireland’s world number one Rory McIlroy was 1up on Irishman Shane Lowry after six holes, and three-times winner Tiger Woods was all square with fellow American Charles Howell III after five. Australian Jason Day, Belgian Nicholas Colsaerts and South African Richard Sterne also delivered upset wins at Dove Mountain on Thursday but Henley’s triumph came as the biggest surprise given his opponent’s scintillating recent form. Schwartzel had won twice, sealed two runner-up spots and added three more top-five finishes in his last seven starts worldwide but he struggled against Henley with four bogeys in the first 13 holes. “I knew Charl was going to be tough,” Henley told reporters. “I just give it everything I had, tried to hang tough and play until the end. “I tried to not get too up or down. I’ve heard a lot of comments from people saying they expected him to win, and that gave me a little motivation for sure.” Henley will next meet Day, who completed a crushing 6&5 win over Zach Johnson when the American missed a birdie putt from 14 feet at the 13th in a bid to keep their match alive. Day had been in full command after making four birdies in the first eight holes and he was 6up overnight before Johnson won the par-five 11th with a birdie. “Everything was good,” said Day, who was five under par after 13 holes. “I missed two greens out of the 13 holes that I played, I hit a lot of good quality shots, and I putted great.” Long-hitting Belgian Colsaerts upset American Bill Haas 5&4 and Sterne, also a power hitter, outgunned American Jason Dufner 1up. In the second round, Colsaerts will take on British world number six Justin Rose who won 2&1 against South Korean veteran K.J. Choi. Sterne, who had been ousted on the opening round in his two previous appearances at the event, will next meet defending champion Hunter Mahan, who crushed Italy’s Matteo Manassero 5&4. In other matches, American Bo Van Pelt hammered Australian John Senden 6&5, Masters champion Bubba Watson beat Briton Chris Wood 2&1 and Spaniard Sergio Garcia scraped past Thailand’s Thongchai Jaidee after 20 holes. Ian Poulter, the 2010 champion, avoided a third consecutive exit at the first hurdle with a 2&1 victory over fellow Briton Stephen Gallacher and will face Van Pelt in the second round. The first-round matches finally got under way at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club after the scheduled resumption had been pushed back four-and-a-half hours due to unplayable conditions. Two more inches of snow blanketed the course overnight, lifting the total to four inches in under 24 hours, and hopes for a quick melt were dashed by plunging temperatures and early morning frost. Just over three-and-a-half hours of golf was possible on Wednesday because of driving rain, sleet and then snow after 23 of the 32 matches had started with none finishing.

69,ACN,"Major snowstorm lashes Great Plains, heads east","Kansas City, Missouri (Reuters) - A major winter storm barreled through the U.S. Great Plains on Thursday, creating hazardous travel that resulted in at least one death, closing schools, scuttling air travel and cutting off power to some communities. More than a foot of snow fell across parts of Kansas, while blowing winds created massive snowdrifts, exacerbating hazardous driving conditions. Highway I-70 was closed for 90 miles from Hays, Kansas eastward to Salina and hotel rooms were fast filling up along the corridor. Shelters were opened for stranded travelers. Winter storm warnings and advisories continued for much of the central and southern Plains and into the upper Midwest and Mississippi River Valley as the storm moved east dropping snow, sleet and freezing rain, the National Weather Service said. The fierce storm was expected to spawn thunderstorms and rain on its southern edge from eastern Texas to Georgia, the forecaster said. Ice storm warnings were in effect for parts of northern Arkansas. Thunder accompanied snow in Kansas City, hit by 2 to 3 inches of snow per hour on Thursday morning. “When there is thunder and lightning, it’s a pretty screaming clue that you are going to have massive snowfall,” said Andy Bailey, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Pleasant Hill, Missouri. Snow tapered off by early afternoon. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon and Kansas Governor Sam Brownback declared states of emergency because of hazardous travel and possible power outages. Brownback ordered state offices closed because of the storm. Kansas City International Airport was closed on Thursday while crews cleared runways. It was unclear when the airport would reopen, spokesman Joe McBride said. At Denver International Airport, some 55 commuter flights were canceled overnight, spokeswoman Laura Coale said. More than 320 flights in and out of Lambert-St. Louis International Airport were scrapped and nearly 50 flights in and out of Omaha’s Eppley Airfield were listed as canceled by midday. In Nebraska, a 19-year-old woman was killed in a two-car accident on Wednesday on Interstate 80 near Giltner. The Nebraska State Patrol said weather was a factor. The brunt of the snowstorm churned through Kansas, causing scores of accidents and forcing vehicles off roads, but there were no fatalities, according to the state highway patrol. Six Kansas Highway patrol cars and some tow trucks were stuck in the Lawrence, Kansas, area Thursday afternoon as they tried to reach stranded motorists, highway patrol spokesman Joshua Kellerman said. “People are getting stuck in the middle of the roadway, it’s just that deep,” Kellerman said. The Missouri Highway Patrol reported a dozen accidents in the district around St. Louis as sleet and snow began to blanket area roads around midmorning, Sergeant Al Nothum said. Some parts of southeast Kansas reported power outages because warmer temperatures created sleet and ice on power lines, said Sharon Watson, a spokesperson for the Kansas Division of Emergency Management. Up to 12.5 inches of snow fell in the northern part of Oklahoma, while Nebraska received 5 to 9 inches, the National Weather Service said. Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, were bracing for 8 inches of snow or more. Schools across parts of Iowa sent students home Thursday morning as snow arrived there, officials said. Drought-stricken farmers in the Great Plains, one of the world’s largest wheat-growing areas, welcomed the moisture brought by the storm, although experts said more rain or snow would be needed to ensure healthy crops. Snow from the powerful storm fell as far south as Tucson, Arizona, on Wednesday. The rare snowfall halted play at the World Golf Championships-Accenture Match Play tournament near Tucson.

70,ACN,Play resumes after lengthy snow delay,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Play finally got under way at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship on Thursday after the resumption of the snow delayed first-round matches was pushed back four-and-a-half hours. Two more inches of snow fell overnight at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club, lifting the total to four inches in under 24 hours, and hopes for a quick melt were dashed by plunging temperatures and early morning frost. Officials repeatedly altered restart times as the par-72 course remained blanketed in white but, after the snow had finally disappeared in the desert sunshine, first-round matches resumed at 1 p.m. local time (3.00 p.m. ET). With parts of the layout still very wet, officials said players would be permitted to lift, clean and replace balls in the fairway. Though morning frost has been forecast for the rest of the week at the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event, being played at 2,800 feet above sea level, conditions are expected to warm up on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. “We’ll stay in the 50s (F) the next couple of days, back to the low 60s on Saturday, and then probably upper 50s again on Sunday as another little weak front goes by,” the PGA Tour’s on-site meteorologist Stewart Williams told reporters. “But it doesn’t look like it has any moisture with it, so it’s just going to drop our temperature a few degrees. Unfortunately we’ll have below normal temperatures for the rest of the week, but at least we’ll have some sun.” Just over three-and-a-half hours of golf was possible on Wednesday because of driving rain, sleet and then snow after 23 of the 32 matches had started with none finishing. Players and caddies were left stunned by the sudden change in conditions and many of them ended up throwing snowballs at one another while waiting for officials to abandon play for the day. “One minute we’re playing golf, albeit it’s a little cool, and then within a space of 25 minutes, it turns from playable to cold drizzle to sleet and to snow,” Ian Poulter, the 2010 champion, said. “It’s just bizarre.” Among the early matches, Australian Jason Day was in full command against American Zach Johnson, four birdies in the first eight holes helping him go 6up after 10 while Poulter was 3up on fellow Briton Stephen Gallacher after 12. American Bo Van Pelt was 5up on Australian John Senden after 12 holes, defending champion Hunter Mahan was 4up on Italy’s Matteo Manassero after nine and American Matt Kuchar was 3up on Japan’s Hiroyuki Fujita after 14. Northern Ireland’s world number one Rory McIlroy, beaten by Mahan 2&1 in last year’s final, and three-times champion Tiger Woods were among those yet to start their first-round matches.

72,ACN,"Donald exits, Mahan and Poulter advance","MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Former champion Luke Donald was the biggest name to fall in the second round of the snow-delayed WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship after being pummeled 7&6 by American Scott Piercy on Friday. The British world number three was totally outplayed by Piercy, who was effectively seven under par on his ball after being conceded a four-foot birdie putt at the short 12th to seal the win. Piercy spectacularly holed out from 228 yards to eagle the par-four fifth, then birdied the sixth, eighth and ninth to go 6up on Donald by the turn on a sunny but cool and breezy day at Dove Mountain. “Scott played very well, I played just very average,” 2011 Match Play champion Donald told reporters. “I probably didn’t drive it well enough today to put any pressure on Scott. “He was just playing extremely solid, didn’t give me really a look. I had a few opportunities on the greens, but for whatever reason I was just not making the putts today, and hence I’m going home.” Making his first appearance in the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event, Piercy will next meet either Steve Stricker or Nick Watney. Stricker was 1up on fellow American Watney after 15 holes. “I played really solid today,” said double PGA Tour champion Piercy, whose 7&6 margin of victory has been eclipsed only five times at this event. “I hit every green in regulation. I got up early and tried to lean on him once I got up. It was just a solid day all around. “I think he was off a little bit,” the American said of Donald who double-bogeyed the opening hole. “From the first tee shot it didn’t look like Luke. I just tried to make some birdies and stay out ahead of him.” The stunning departure of Donald follows the premature exits on Thursday of Northern Irish world number one Rory McIlroy and three-times champion Tiger Woods. McIlroy, a losing finalist last year, was eliminated 1up by Ireland’s Shane Lowry and Woods was ousted 2&1 by fellow American Charles Howell III. World number 68 Lowry continued his winning form on Friday, making five birdies in a flawless display on the way to a commanding 6&5 victory over Swede Carl Pettersson. Long-hitting Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts became the first player to reach the third round with a 4&2 upset win over British world number six Justin Rose on Friday. Colsaerts, who lost in the opening round last year on his debut at the event, took control with three birdies in the first eight holes before sealing victory with a par at the short 16th, where Rose bogeyed. Nicknamed the ‘Belgian Bomber’ because of his power hitting, Colsaerts will next face American Matt Kuchar, who beat Spaniard Sergio Garcia 2&1 in a closely contested match between two Ryder Cup players. Ian Poulter, the 2010 champion, also advanced with a 3&1 victory over American Bo Van Pelt to set up a third-round meeting with South African Tim Clark, who beat Dane Thorbjorn Olesen 3&2. “I had seven birdies, no bogeys, and when you play like that, and you don’t give your opponent anything, then obviously it’s going to be a tough day for him,” said matchplay specialist Poulter with a smile. “So I’m very pleased how I took some of the mistakes from yesterday away and kept it a very clean card.” Defending champion Hunter Mahan never trailed on the way to a commanding 4&3 win against South African Richard Sterne and he will take on Germany’s Martin Kaymer in the next round. Kaymer, who lost 3&2 to Donald in the 2011 Match Play Championship final, advanced by beating Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello 2&1.

73,ACN,Major snowstorm headed for New England,"BOSTON (Reuters) - New England braced on Friday for its third snowstorm in three weekends, gathering crews to ready roads and trim trees ahead of the snow, sleet and freezing rain that hit the Midwest. The storm blanketed states from Minnesota to Ohio earlier this week, dumping more than a foot of snow in Kansas on Thursday, forcing airports to cancel hundreds of flights and stranding motorists on highways. The storm was expected to pelt New England’s coastal areas from northern Connecticut to southern Maine with a mix of snow and rain late on Friday, said National Weather Service meteorologist John Foley. Snow was predicted for Saturday, with up to a foot possible in central Massachusetts, Foley said. “I’m not thrilled that we’ve got more snow coming this weekend. I’ve had enough of winter,” said John Bonnanzio, 54, group editor at Mutual Fund Investors Association outside of Boston. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino met with his “Snow Team” on Friday, as city crews prepared to trim trees to reduce the risk for downed power lines and pre-treat roadways to guard against slippery conditions. “Boston will be ready for its third consecutive weekend storm,” Menino said in a statement. “Use common sense and stay off the roads while snowfall is heaviest tomorrow.” For some Boston-area residents the prospect of yet another weekend snowstorm was good news. “I’m excited. ... I went out skiing in the streets during the last one, and I’ll do the same thing again,” said Jesse Beecher, 29, who works for a film production company. The storm barreled eastward for the weekend after hitting the Midwest during the work week. In Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Sly James said that about 60 buses were stuck on snowbound streets on Thursday, and even tow trucks were immobilized. “It’s still an ongoing process to get people off the roads,” he told CNN. About 570 flights were canceled on Friday, with 127 of them at Chicago’s O’Hare airport. Kansas City International Airport reopened after being closed on Thursday while crews cleared runways. The National Weather Service said early in the morning that the storm, headed northeast into the upper Great Lakes, may bring sleet and freezing rain to the Appalachians and mid-Atlantic states, with thunderstorms expected on the storm’s southern fringe in the southeastern United States. Kansas bore the brunt of the bad weather on Thursday, with up to 15 inches of snow in some parts of the state, according to the National Weather Service. A 200-mile (323-km) stretch of Interstate 70 in central Kansas was closed and strewn with cars stuck in snow. National Guard troops riding in Humvees were dispatched to look for stranded motorists along the interstate and other highways, said Sharon Watson, a spokeswoman for Kansas emergency management services. The storm triggered severe thunderstorms from eastern Texas to Georgia. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon and Kansas Governor Sam Brownback declared states of emergency because of hazardous travel and possible power outages. Brownback ordered state offices closed. In Nebraska, a 19-year-old woman was killed in a two-car accident on Wednesday on Interstate 80 near Giltner. The Nebraska State Patrol said weather was a factor. An 18-year-old man died in Oklahoma when his vehicle slid into a tractor-trailer on a slushy state highway, the state’s highway patrol said. Drought-stricken farmers in the Great Plains, one of the world’s largest wheat-growing areas, welcomed the moisture brought by the storm, although experts said more rain or snow would be needed to ensure healthy crops.

74,ACN,"Pettersson, Fernandez-Castano advance at Match Play","MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Carl Pettersson and Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano both advanced when the last two matches in the marathon, snow-delayed first round of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship were completed on Friday. On a sunny but cool morning at Dove Mountain in Arizona’s high desert, Swede Pettersson scraped past American Rickie Fowler after 19 holes and Spaniard Fernandez-Castano beat Italy’s Francesco Molinari 2up. Pettersson will next meet Ireland’s Shane Lowry, a shock 1up winner over world number one Rory McIlroy, while Fernandez-Castano will face American Charles Howell III, who upset three-times winner Tiger Woods 2&1. The only previous time the top two players were eliminated from the first round of the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event was in 2002 when Woods and Phil Mickelson were both knocked out. Based on the seedings, there were 15 upsets in the 32 first-round matches which took just over 50 hours to finish after driving snow led to play being suspended on Wednesday after only three-and-a-half hours of action. A total of four inches of snow had fallen by Thursday morning but, weather-permitting, the second round will be completed on Friday, with the third round and quarter-finals set for Saturday in a bid to get the tournament back on track. Thankfully, fears of a possible frost delay on Friday morning never materialized and play began on time in the two incomplete first-round matches. Pettersson was 1up on Fowler after 17 holes overnight but the American made it all square with a conceded birdie at the par-four 18th where he struck a superb approach to inside two feet. However Fowler lost the match with a bogey on the 19th hole, the par-four 10th, after his drive ended up well right in the desert scrub. It was the only the second time in four Match Play appearances that five-times PGA Tour winner Pettersson had reached the second round. Fernandez-Castano and Molinari were all square overnight after 15 holes but the Italian folded quickly with bogeys on 16 and 18 to gift the Spaniard a spot in the second round.

75,ACN,Irishman Lowry stuns McIlroy at Match Play,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Ireland’s Shane Lowry knew “deep down” that he could beat Rory McIlroy and drew on that self-belief to pull off a stunning upset over the world number one in the snow-delayed first round of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship on Thursday. Ranked 68th in the world, Lowry chipped in twice for birdie after the turn to take control against his good friend before getting up and down from a greenside bunker to par the 18th and seal victory in fading light at Dove Mountain. “I’m very happy to be honest,” Lowry told reporters. “Obviously it was always going to be a tough match for me against Rory today, playing against the world number one. I’m feeling quite good now. “Deep down I knew I could beat him. I’m not here for no reason. I’m not here to make up the numbers. “But it’s important not to get too high now because it’s only the first round. I’ve got another match tomorrow and I’m really looking forward to playing that.” The 25-year-old Lowry will next meet either Swede Carl Pettersson or American Rickie Fowler, who will have to complete their first-round match early on Friday. Pettersson was one up after 17 holes. “I didn’t make enough birdies in the end,” said the 23-year-old McIlroy. “Shane had a nice little stretch around part of the back nine. I hung in there, but I just didn’t do enough. “I probably would have lost by more if I had played someone else in the field. It wasn’t a great quality match. I missed a lot of irons right.” Lowry, who has known twice major winner McIlroy since their amateur days, made a stumbling start, bogeys at the second, third and fourth leaving him two down. Beaten in last year’s final by American Hunter Mahan, McIlroy bogeyed the par-three sixth after missing the green well to the right for his lead to be trimmed to one and Lowry birdied the seventh to make it all square. Though Lowry also faltered with another bogey at the ninth, he then took control in explosive fashion. He chipped in from 18 feet to birdie the par-five 11th and holed out from double that distance from behind the green for another birdie at the par-three 12th, to go 1 up. A stunning three-wood from Lowry at the par-five 13th, where his ball eventually settled just three feet from the flag, led to a conceded eagle there after McIlroy missed a birdie attempt from just five feet. Lowry slipped up with a three-putt bogey at the par-four 14th but he got back to two up after the world number one made a hash of the 15th. McIlroy’s drive ended up next to a bush well left of the green from where he played left-handed, dumping his ball into a greenside bunker. With daylight fading, McIlroy bladed his third shot over the back of the green and conceded the hole. McIlroy again pulled one back when he rolled in a nine-footer to birdie the short 16th but Lowry hung on with matching pars at 17 and 18 to wrap up the win. “I was quite nervous starting off,” said Lowry, who became only the third amateur to triumph on the European Tour with a playoff victory for the 2009 Irish Open. “I handed him a few holes early doors, but he handed me a few back later on in the round. And this is match play, and I got a few breaks where I needed them, and I’m just fortunate to win.” ",2222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-lowry/irishman-lowry-stuns-mcilroy-at-match-play-idUSBRE91L03K20130222
76,ACN,Woods exits first round of Match Play,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Three-times winner Tiger Woods, despite playing well, was stunningly eliminated in the snow-delayed first round of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship on Thursday, losing 2&1 to Charles Howell III. Woods never led in a flawless encounter where not one bogey was recorded but he got back to all square with four holes to play before fellow American and good friend Howell birdied the 15th and 16th to regain control. Howell almost holed out with his approach at the par-15th, his ball settling just inches from the cup, then sank a 24-footer at the par-three 16th to go 2-up. Both players parred the 17th in fading daylight at Dove Mountain as Woods was knocked out at the first hurdle for a third time at the World Golf Championships (WGC) event. “I played well, I really did,” Woods, Match Play champion in 2003, 2004 and 2008, told reporters. “I hit a lot of good shots out there. I didn’t make a bogey out there. “Unfortunately it’s the nature of the format, and I’m not advancing. It’s the nature of the format. You’ve just got to beat the guy you’re playing against, and I didn’t do that today.” Howell, playing Woods for the first time in this format in an official tournament since he lost to his compatriot in the quarter-finals of the 1996 U.S. amateur championship, was euphoric after his win. “As far as beating Tiger Woods goes, it shows you that match play is crazy,” he smiled after outscoring Woods by four birdies to two on a 7,791-yard layout playing ultra-long due to the wet, post-snow conditions. “I did have to play a good round, but hey, it’s a bit hard to believe I’m sitting here today with this (win). I’ve played a lot of golf with Tiger, and he’s been a friend. He’s helped me out along the way. “I’ve had questions, I’ve asked for help from him, he’s always been extremely gracious with that. I don’t think I’ve ever beat the guy while we were playing in the same group. That goes back to (friendlies at) Isleworth.” Howell went 1-up for the first time with a birdie at the par-five second and again at the par-five eighth where he drained a 28-footer. Though Woods kept in close touch, Howell effectively closed the door on the match with his two-birdie burst at 15 and 16. “I knew I had to play extremely well to have a chance, and I still kept waiting for that Tiger moment,” said the 33-year-old Howell, who is known for his workaholic approach to the game. “He hit his second shot into 15 from the fairway, looked awfully good, but it pitched long. And his tee shot on 16 never left the flag. He missed that putt.” After Howell had rolled in his 24-footer at the par-three 16th, Woods missed with his birdie attempt from 11 feet. “He never got more than one-up most of the day until he made that putt there at 16,” said Woods, who also lost in the first round of the Match Play Championship in 2002 and 2011. “But it was a tight match. “I had some putts for birdie at 10, 11, 12. He had a (birdie) putt there at 14. We missed our share of putts out there. It was a good, solid match for both of us.” ",2222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-woods/woods-exits-first-round-of-match-play-idUSBRE91L04A20130222
77,ACN,McIlroy and Woods go out on day of upsets,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - World number one Rory McIlroy and three-times winner Tiger Woods were both sent packing in stunning fashion in the snow-delayed first round of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship on Thursday. Northern Irishman McIlroy, a losing finalist last year, was ousted 1-up by his good friend Shane Lowry of Ireland while Woods was eliminated 2&1 by fellow American Charles Howell in fading light at Dove Mountain. Once again the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event lived up to its reputation for wild unpredictability and there were 14 upsets from the 30 matches which finished at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club. Two matches will have to be completed on Friday, a knock-on effect from Wednesday when just three-and-a-half hours of play was possible because of driving rain, sleet and then snow. The premature departure of McIlroy in his first PGA Tour appearance of the year was stunning, but Lowry always believed he had the game to pull off an upset win. “Deep down I knew I could beat him,” the 25-year-old Irishman said after chipping in for birdie at the 11th and 12th to take control of the match. “I’m not here for no reason. I’m not here to make up the numbers. “It was a bit of an up-and-down match, and I’m not going to lie, we didn’t play our best golf. But that’s match play. I’m happy to get the win, and I’m looking forward to tomorrow.” Woods, Match Play champion in 2003, 2004 and 2008, was eliminated at the first hurdle for a third time at the event. “I played well, I really did,” said the world number two. “I hit a lot of good shots out there. I didn’t make a bogey out there. Unfortunately it’s the nature of the format, and I’m not advancing.” Howell, who has played Woods several times in practice, was delighted to beat the former world number one for the first time. “I knew I had to play extremely well to have a chance, and I still kept waiting for that Tiger moment,” said Howell, who set up the win with birdies at the 15th, where he nearly holed out with a wedge, and the 16th. “I had nothing to lose coming into this match. Every time Tiger Woods tees it up, he’s a marked man and he’s got the bulls-eye on his back. It shows you that match play is crazy. I did have to play a good round.” In other upsets, PGA Tour rookie Russell Henley beat in-form South African Charl Schwartzel 1-up and Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello came from two down with seven holes left to scrape past British world number eight Lee Westwood after 19 holes. Australian Jason Day, Belgian Nicholas Colsaerts and South African Richard Sterne also delivered upset wins based on the seedings but Henley’s triumph initially caught the eye given his opponent’s scintillating recent form. The American rookie, who clinched his maiden PGA Tour victory at last month’s Sony Open, never trailed and held off a late fightback by 2011 Masters champion Schwartzel with pars on the last three holes. Schwartzel had won twice, sealed two runner-up spots and added three more top-five finishes in his last seven starts worldwide but he struggled against Henley with four bogeys in the first 13 holes. “I just give it everything I had, tried to hang tough and play until the end,” said Henley. “I’ve heard a lot of comments from people saying they expected him to win, and that gave me a little motivation for sure.” Henley will next meet Day, who completed a crushing 6&5 win over Zach Johnson when the American missed a birdie putt from 14 feet at the 13th in a bid to keep their match alive. “Everything was good,” said Day, who was five under par after 13 holes. “I missed two greens out of the 13 holes that I played, I hit a lot of good quality shots, and I putted great.” Cabrera-Bello, ranked 60th in the world, made three birdies in his last 10 holes and was elated after beating former world number one Westwood. “It feels very good,” the Spaniard said. “I just know really the odds were in his favor, but in match play anything can happen. I just tried my best, and I was fortunate enough to win.” Long-hitting Belgian Colsaerts crushed American Bill Haas 5&4 and Sterne, also a power hitter, outgunned American Jason Dufner 1-up. In the second round, Colsaerts will take on British world number six Justin Rose who won 2&1 against South Korean veteran K.J. Choi. Sterne, who had lost in the opening round in his two previous appearances at the event, will next meet champion Hunter Mahan, who crushed Italy’s Matteo Manassero 5&4. Masters champion Bubba Watson beat Briton Chris Wood 2&1 and Ian Poulter, the 2010 champion, avoided a third consecutive exit at the first hurdle with a 2&1 victory over fellow Briton Stephen Gallacher.

78,ACN,Third straight weekend storm heads for New England,"BOSTON (Reuters) - New England faced a third straight weekend of storms dumping a messy mix of wet snow and freezing rain across the region, meteorologists said Saturday. Another storm in the West is rolling out of the Rocky Mountains this weekend and could create blizzard conditions in Colorado, according to a National Weather Service advisory. Much of the Midwest is already blanketed with snow. More than a foot of snow was reported in Kansas on Thursday, forcing airports to cancel hundreds of flights and leaving motorists stranded on highways. Starting on Saturday, the New England coast - from northern Connecticut to southern Maine - was expecting an extended mix of snow and rain, according to a National Weather Service advisory, while inland areas could see a significant accumulation of snow. Wet snow and freezing rain were expected Saturday afternoon through Sunday evening in southern New Hampshire, northern Rhode Island and much of Massachusetts. The Boston metropolitan area could see from 2 to 5 inches of snow, while parts of central Massachusetts may get up to 12 inches, said National Weather Service meteorologist John Foley. The heaviest snowfall was expected Saturday night through Sunday morning, with 1 to 2 inches per hour possible, the weather service said. Despite the forecasts, some residents were taking it in stride, wondering what all the fuss was about. “Look, it’s winter, it’s New England, it snows. Happens every time!” said Steve Scardino, a software sales executive and lifelong New Englander from Hopkinton, Massachusetts. But others were not so sanguine. Tom Meek of Cambridge said he had cancelled dinner plans with relatives two weekends in a row because of bad weather and this time, he would just take his chances. “We can’t let Mother Nature impound us again,” Meek said. NStar Electric president, Craig Hallstrom, said the utility’s emergency response plan had been well tested this winter. The weather service said the storm may bring sleet and freezing rain to the Appalachians and mid-Atlantic states as well, with thunderstorms expected in the Southeast. It likely will dump rain from New York City to Philadelphia, it said. The storm barreled eastward for the weekend after pummeling the Midwest during the week. In Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Sly James said about 60 buses were stuck on snowbound streets on Friday, and even tow trucks were immobilized. “It’s still an ongoing process to get people off the roads,” he told CNN. Kansas bore the brunt of the bad weather on Thursday, with up to 15 inches of snow in some parts of the state, according to the National Weather Service. A closed 200-mile (323-km) stretch of Interstate 70 in central Kansas was strewn with cars stuck in snow. National Guard troops were dispatched in Humvees to look for stranded motorists along the interstate and other highways, said Sharon Watson, a spokeswoman for Kansas emergency management services. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon and Kansas Governor Sam Brownback declared states of emergency because of possible power outages and generally hazardous travel. Drought-stricken farmers in the Great Plains, one of the world’s largest wheat-growing areas, welcomed the moisture, although experts said even more rain or snow would be needed to ensure healthy crops. Meanwhile, in the Southeast, a “rich supply of Gulf moisture” will drive heavy rainfall from the Florida Panhandle east to the Carolinas on Saturday, the National Weather Service advisory said.

79,ACN,Colsaerts thrives on tour with roadie days behind him,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - With his reckless nightclubbing days while living “like a roadie” now well behind him, Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts has relished his golfing success over the last two years. The power hitter from Brussels has triumphed twice on the European Tour during that time, made a stunning debut at last year’s Ryder Cup and has flourished in the opening rounds of the elite WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship this week. Colsaerts thumped in-form American Bill Haas 5&4 in the opening round of the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event and on Friday upset British world number six Justin Rose 4&2 to reach the last 16 at Dove Mountain. “I played pretty good the last couple of holes and made sure this game wasn’t really going to go too far,” the 30-year-old Belgian told reporters after getting to five-under par after 16 holes. Colsaerts was delighted to record another victory over Rose, having beaten the Englishman 4&3 in the last 16 of the 2012 European Tour’s Volvo World Match Play Championship which he went on to win. “I felt pretty confident going out knowing, if I played my game, I would have a fair chance to do the job,” the Belgian said. “But then anything can happen. “When you play somebody of the stature of Justin, it can always go very fast one way or the other.” Colsaerts, who lost in the opening round at Dove Mountain last year on his debut at the event, took control with three birdies in the first eight holes before sealing victory with a par at the short 16th, where Rose bogeyed. Nicknamed the ‘Belgian Bomber’ because of his prodigious length off the tee, Colsaerts will face American Matt Kuchar in the third round on Saturday. “I have much shorter irons into greens than some of the other guys so, if I’m on, I’m going to give myself a lot of birdie tries,” the Belgian said. “You want to hole a few and, if that happens, you’re probably going to come out on top.” While Colsaerts does not regret his years of nightclubbing, he will be forever thankful that he decided to resurrect his promising golf career. “You just wake up one day and realize that all these guys you played golf with are doing stuff that you should do any given day,” he said. “You realize that you’re missing out on stuff, and it takes you a couple of years to come back. “The last couple of years have been extremely enjoyable,” smiled Colsaerts, who fired a 10-under-par 62 on his ball in his first Ryder Cup match when he and Lee Westwood beat Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker 1 up in the opening fourballs. Asked what how much of a ‘party boy’ he had been when golf had become a lower priority for him, Colsaerts replied: “I hung around the clubbing scene back home, and it was a lot of fun. “I’ve always been into music. It was one of my passions and I lived like a roadie for a couple of years pretty much. You just go hang out in clubs and listen to the DJs because house music was always my thing. “Back home these clubs all close at like 7:00, 8:00 in the morning. They’re not like over here when they close at 2:00, so you’ve got to push it a bit further.” ",2232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-colsaerts/colsaerts-thrives-on-tour-with-roadie-days-behind-him-idUSBRE91M03E20130223
80,ACN,Time off gives Poulter a Match Play boost,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - A bold decision to take six weeks off since he tied for ninth at the PGA Tour’s season-opening Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Hawaii has, so far, proved to be immensely beneficial for Ian Poulter. The fashion conscious Englishman spent much of that time making a few equipment changes and working on his swing, a strategy that has helped him stay unbeaten after the first two rounds of this week’s WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. “I think I’m probably more prepared than I’ve ever been,” Poulter told reporters after beating American Bo Van Pelt 3&1 in the snow-delayed second round at Dove Mountain on Friday. “The equipment change, changing new shafts in all my irons, knocking out a five-wood out of the bag and putting in an extra gap wedge, picking up four miles an hour of ball speed on the driver, I couldn’t be any happier coming into this week. “I couldn’t be any happier how I’ve struck it, how the ball flight has been, my yardages ... If I got beat today, I’d still be walking away thinking that I’ve made an improvement from where I was six months ago, and that’s good.” Asked what had prompted his equipment change, Poulter replied: “When you dive into my stats and look at areas that I need to improve and how the golf courses are set up year-in, year-out, I need to hit it farther to try and stay competitive. “I also need to hit it higher and stop the ball quicker. If I continue with the same shafts, then it’s just not going to happen, so I need to look at ways to try and get better, get a bit stronger.” Long regarded as one of the best putters in the game, the flamboyant Briton has developed into a formidable matchplay specialist with a steely focus unequalled by most of his peers. He has been a talismanic force for Europe at the Ryder Cup and won the European Tour’s Volvo World Match Play Championship in 2011 a year after clinching the WGC title at Dove Mountain. “Obviously my record in match play is pretty good,” said Poulter, who will face South African Tim Clark in the third round on Saturday. “You come here knowing that if you play six great matches, you’re going to be in a really good position. “It’s an opportunity, certainly the way the draw is done, where if you get through a good chunk of matches, then it potentially could be slightly easier to win a matchplay event than it might be in stroke play.” Poulter, who outplayed fellow Briton Paul Casey 4&2 in the 2010 Match Play Championship final to earn his first PGA Tour title, was delighted with his form on Friday as he piled up seven birdies in a bogey-free display. “When you play like that, and you don’t give your opponent anything, then obviously it’s going to be a tough day for him,” Poulter, a 12-times winner on the European Tour, said with a grin. “So I’m very pleased how I took some of the mistakes from yesterday away and kept it a very clean card.” ",2232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-poulter/time-off-gives-poulter-a-match-play-boost-idUSBRE91M02J20130223
81,ACN,"Donald exits, Mahan and Poulter advance","MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Former champion Luke Donald was the biggest name to fall in the second round of the snow-delayed WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship after being pummeled 7&6 by American Scott Piercy on Friday. The British world number three was totally outplayed by Piercy, who was effectively seven-under par on his ball after being conceded a four-foot birdie putt at the short 12th to seal the win. Piercy spectacularly holed out with a four-iron from 221 yards to eagle the par-four fifth, then birdied the sixth, eighth and ninth to go 6up on Donald by the turn on a sunny but cool and breezy day at Dove Mountain. “Scott played very well, I played just very average,” 2011 Match Play champion Donald told reporters. “I probably didn’t drive it well enough today to put any pressure on Scott. “He was just playing extremely solid, didn’t give me really a look. I had a few opportunities on the greens, but for whatever reason I was just not making the putts today, and hence I’m going home.” Making his first appearance in the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event, Piercy will next meet 2001 champion Steve Stricker who edged past fellow American Nick Watney after 21 holes. “I played really solid today,” said double PGA Tour champion Piercy, whose 7&6 margin of victory has been eclipsed only five times at this event. “I hit every green in regulation. I got up early and tried to lean on him once I got up. It was just a solid day all around. “I think he was off a little bit,” the American said of Donald who double-bogeyed the opening hole. “From the first tee shot it didn’t look like Luke. I just tried to make some birdies and stay out ahead of him.” The stunning departure of Donald follows the premature exits on Thursday of world number one Rory McIlroy and three-times champion Tiger Woods. Northern Irish McIlroy, a losing finalist last year, was eliminated 1up by Ireland’s Shane Lowry and Woods was eliminated 2&1 by fellow American Charles Howell III. World number 68 Lowry continued his winning form on Friday, making five birdies in a flawless display on the way to a commanding 6&5 victory over Swede Carl Pettersson. Howell, however, ran out of steam as he was crushed 6&5 by Spaniard Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano. Long-hitting Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts became the first player to reach the third round with a 4&2 upset win over British world number six Justin Rose on Friday. Nicknamed the ‘Belgian Bomber’ because of his power hitting, Colsaerts will next face American Matt Kuchar, who beat Spaniard Sergio Garcia 2&1 in a closely contested match between two Ryder Cup players. Ian Poulter, the 2010 champion, also advanced with a 3&1 victory over American Bo Van Pelt to set up a third-round encounter with South African Tim Clark, who beat Dane Thorbjorn Olesen 3&2. “I had seven birdies, no bogeys, and when you play like that, and you don’t give your opponent anything, then obviously it’s going to be a tough day for him,” matchplay specialist Poulter said with a smile. Defending champion Hunter Mahan never trailed on the way to a commanding 4&3 win against South African Richard Sterne and he will take on Germany’s Martin Kaymer in the next round. Kaymer, who lost 3&2 to Donald in the 2011 Match Play Championship final, advanced by beating Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello 2&1. “I just feel comfortable here ... from the tees to the greens and everything,” said Mahan. “I feel like I just know where I need to hit it. “Confidence is high. I know I can play this place well, and I know I can beat anybody on any given day.” In other second-round matches, Masters champion Bubba Watson battled past fellow American Jim Furyk after 22 holes and U.S. Open winner Webb Simpson beat Swede Peter Hanson 1up after never leading until the 18th. With the snow-delayed first round finally completed earlier on Friday, officials plan to get the tournament back on track with the third round and quarter-finals both set for Saturday.

82,ACN,Piercy hits another jackpot to stun Donald,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Six years after he overcame the odds to earn a $2 million cheque, Scott Piercy landed a different jackpot with a stunning 7&6 victory over Luke Donald at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship on Friday. Though he had not competed in matchplay golf during that long span until he arrived at Dove Mountain this week, Piercy produced imperious form to eliminate the British world number three in the second round of an event Donald had won in 2011. “I played really solid today,” a beaming Piercy told reporters after totally outshining former world number one Donald on a sunny afternoon in Arizona’s high desert. “I hit every green in regulation. “I got up early and tried to lean on him once I got up. It was just a solid day all around. I just tried to make some birdies and stay out ahead of him.” In 2007, Piercy hit the jackpot with a $2 million pay-day when he birdied five of the last six holes to triumph at the made-for-television, winner-take-all Ultimate Game tournament in his hometown of Las Vegas. That success came on his fifth wedding anniversary and he has described it as his biggest thrill in golf. “It worked out good for me there,” Piercy said with a smile as he reflected back on his Ultimate Game triumph, before saying he had experienced less pressure at Dove Mountain this week. “You know what, I actually feel really relaxed out there,” he added. “Me and Luke’s games are a lot different, and I feel like if I get things going, I’ve got a good chance of beating him. “I played well, and he was off a little bit, that’s why it looked so one-sided. I hadn’t played match play for a long time, and I didn’t know what to expect. “But you’re only playing one guy ... so just play solid golf and try to win,” said the American, who won his second PGA Tour title at last year’s Canadian Open. Piercy spectacularly holed out with a four-iron from 221 yards to eagle the par-four fifth, then birdied the sixth, eighth and ninth to go 6up on Donald by the turn. The 34-year-old American was effectively seven under par on his ball after being conceded a four-foot birdie putt at the short 12th to seal the upset win. On one level, though, Piercy did not regard his victory as that much of a surprise. “Tiger (Woods) raised the bar a lot, and everybody out here is better,” he said. “It’s not just 10 guys who are the best anymore. There are 50, 60 guys every week, and there are 60 guys here. “When somebody is on, they’re on. There’s not as big of a spread between who the best players are and sort of the next tier.” Piercy likes the way his professional golfing career has steadily followed an upward curve. “It’s been building blocks, steps,” he said. “I won in Reno first, which is sort of a smaller event, and then Canada is bigger. I’ve gotten into the WGC events and now the majors, and I’ve got to feel comfortable playing in these. “I feel like I can compete … and I definitely want to win WGC events, majors. One of my goals is to win a couple times in a year. Winning takes care of a lot. So if you win, then hopefully that elite will come.” ",2232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-piercy/piercy-hits-another-jackpot-to-stun-donald-idUSBRE91M02C20130223

84,ACN,Mahan and Kuchar to meet in Match Play final,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Defending champion Hunter Mahan relied on a sharp short game to book his place in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final with a commanding 4&3 victory over 2010 winner Ian Poulter on Sunday. On a bitterly cold and windy morning in Arizona’s high desert, American Mahan sealed victory with a matching birdie at the driveable par-four 15th, sinking a four-footer after Englishman Poulter had rolled in a seven-foot putt. Mahan, who delivered a superb display of chipping in difficult scoring conditions, will face compatriot Matt Kuchar in the title match later on Sunday at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club. Kuchar came from one down after three holes to beat Australian Jason Day 4&3 and will appear in the Match Play final for the first time after reaching at least the last eight for three years in a row. “I’m excited to have a chance back at Hunter,” said Kuchar, who was beaten 6&5 by Mahan in last year’s quarter-finals at Dove Mountain. “He’s a fantastic player, a fantastic ball striker. “Being able to control the spin and trajectory of your ball in this wind is an important thing, so it’ll be another tough match. He’s proved himself a great player in this format.” Mahan, who won last year’s title with a 2&1 victory over Rory McIlroy in the final, is aiming to emulate Tiger Woods (champion in 2003, 2004 and 2008) as the only back-to-back winner of the elite event. “I know I’m playing well,” said Mahan, who has completed 166 consecutive holes at the Match Play without trailing in a run dating back to the opening round last year. “That’s the best thing I have going for me. My short game and putting are great right now, and those are things I’m probably going to have to lean on this afternoon.” Mahan, who had been all square with matchplay specialist Poulter after four holes, went 1up after the Briton took four shots to reach the green at the par-four fifth. The American doubled his advantage at the par-five eighth, where he chipped from below the green to two feet, and remained 2up after hitting a superb pitch from 76 yards to two feet for a conceded par at the ninth. After ending up behind the green off the tee at the par-three 12th, Mahan spectacularly chipped in for birdie to go 3up on Poulter as he maintained a tight grip on the match. The Englishman also lost the par-four 14th, recording a bogey there after finding the right rough off the tee and missing the green to the right with his approach to trail by four with just four holes remaining. One hole later, Mahan ended the match after his drive ended up just off the green and he chipped up to four feet to set up his fifth birdie of the day. Mahan is aiming to emulate Woods, with 16, and Australian Geoff Ogilvy, with three, as the only players with more than two World Golf Championships (WGC) titles. Mahan also won the 2010 Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone. Kuchar took early control against an out-of-sorts Day with birdies at the sixth, where he sank a 12-footer, and at the eighth, where he chipped to within two feet of the flagstick, to go 2up. The American also won the par-four ninth after Day bogeyed but then slipped back to 2up by making a mess of the 10th where his drive sailed left into the desert scrub. Day also lost the par-five 13th, where he went from the left rough off the tee to a fairway bunker and then into an unplayable lie in desert waste behind the green to go three down. Kuchar sealed victory by sinking a five-foot birdie putt at the 15th where Day missed his attempt from 22 feet. “It’s fun to continue to survive,” said U.S. Ryder Cup player Kuchar, a four-times PGA Tour champion who is seeking his first WGC crown. “I’m so excited to make the championship match. It’s a thrill.” ",2242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-semis/mahan-and-kuchar-to-meet-in-match-play-final-idUSBRE91N0CZ20130224
85,ACN,Passionate Poulter again fuelled by matchplay energy,"MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Whether it is the biennial Ryder Cup or the annual WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, Ian Poulter has always been electrified by the challenge of one-on-one golf. It has been no different this week at Dove Mountain where the flamboyant Englishman has remained unbeaten after four matches as he bids to replicate his title triumph here three years ago. “My record in match play is very, very good and I’m just very comfortable going toe-to-toe with somebody,” Poulter told reporters after beating American veteran Steve Stricker 3&2 in the quarter-finals on Saturday. “I’m playing for myself this week. I really enjoy the fun of match play. As good as my record is in Ryder Cup, in some way it doesn’t translate into playing just for yourself.” Poulter has been a talismanic force for Europe at the Ryder Cup where he has compiled an overall record of 12-3-0 with his eye-bulging, fist-pumping passion. Asked to compare the intensity of the Ryder Cup with his focus at the Match Play Championship, Poulter replied: “It’s there. It’s there. Definitely, it’s there. But you can’t compare it. It’s very difficult. “In Ryder Cup you’ve got 50,000 fans, and here you haven’t quite got that many fans, so you’re not feeding off the crowd, you’re just trying to do it yourself. “You can’t get as much adrenaline going as you can in the Ryder Cup, but yet there’s still intense moments out there on the golf course to switch your brain on,” the Briton said after improving his Match Play Championship (win-loss) record to 22-9. Poulter made several clutch putts and one chip-in on the way to his victory over Stricker as he set up a mouth-watering showdown with champion Hunter Mahan in Sunday’s semi-finals. Long regarded as one of the best putters in the game, Poulter believes his all-round form this week very close to that in 2010 when he outplayed fellow Briton Paul Casey 4&2 in the Match Play Championship final. “I feel as good,” said the ultra-confident Englishman, a 12-times winner on the European Tour. “I feel I’m a better player today than what I was in 2010. “I feel more equipped than what I was in 2010. I feel like I’m rolling the ball as good as I was certainly in 2010.” Poulter’s decision to take six weeks off competitive golf since he tied for ninth at the PGA Tour’s season-opening Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Hawaii has been especially beneficial this week. “I couldn’t be any more ready to play golf,” he smiled. “Albeit I never played a round of golf for the last four weeks of my six weeks off, I didn’t play one round, I didn’t play one hole, so I came here very, very well practiced. “I had a lot of range work to do, so I’ve done that, and it’s transferred from the range to the golf course this week. It was a case of, yes, I have had six weeks off and I just need to get that buzz going. “I feel really good. It will be more mentally tiring than anything else over the next couple of rounds, so hopefully I can pull on what I’ve done in the last six weeks ... and be really strong tomorrow.” The two semi-finals will be followed by the championship final at Dove Mountain on Sunday.

86,ACN,"""Amazing feeling"" for triumphant Kuchar","MARANA, Arizona (Reuters) - Matt Kuchar felt as if he ruled the golfing world on Sunday after landing his first World Golf Championships (WGC) title with a 2&1 victory over Hunter Mahan in the Accenture Match Play Championship final. The 34-year-old American emerged triumphant after a marathon week at Dove Mountain that began with a snow delay on Wednesday, winning all six of his matches in an elite event that brings together the game’s leading players. Last year, Kuchar clinched his fourth PGA Tour title at the Players Championship, which is unofficially regarded as the “fifth” major, and he was thrilled on Sunday to add a WGC crown to his career resume. “It’s an incredible feeling,” smiled Kuchar, who will climb to eighth in the world rankings which will be issued on Monday. “Tough to compare with the matchplay difference, but you’ve got two fields that are the strongest fields in golf,” he said of the Players Championship versus the prestigious WGC tournaments. “You’ve got the best players in the game of golf showing up, and to be a champion at an event where you’ve beaten the best in the world, it’s just an amazing feeling.” When Kuchar won the 2012 Players Championship by two shots at the TPC Sawgrass to secure a $1.71 million pay cheque, it was the greatest achievement of his career. “So many things were so cool to me about winning the Players,” the soft-spoken American recalled. “I look at the Players as having the strongest field in the game of golf on one of the most difficult courses. “It also finished on Mother’s Day. My mom had never been to a tournament that I had won, so to have all those things kind of come together was just a really special week. “But to be here, to win my first World Golf Championship in this format, to win six matches, to win two matches on Saturday and two matches on Sunday, it is just an amazing feeling.” Kuchar had to withstand a pressure-laden back nine on a bitterly cold and windy Sunday afternoon at Dove Mountain where his compatriot Mahan fought back from a four-down deficit at the turn. “He played a fantastic back side, just really kind of put the pressure back on me,” Kuchar said of Mahan’s stirring run of four birdies in five holes from the 11th. “You could feel Hunter gaining the momentum. “I had that 4-up lead on the front, and then every hole was just so difficult. With the conditions the way they were today that there was just a bogey around any corner. Hunter made a couple of birdies there to put some pressure on me.” Asked how he had been able to handle the escalating pressure over the closing holes, Kuchar replied: “I think I was hiding in my ski cap and ski mitts and did a good job of covering up any sort of nervousness. “I did a great job today of being excited to hit the next shot. I knew that if I was to have a lapse of any sort, mentally or physically ... the match could swing, momentum could swing pretty quickly. “I had a great time, but I was also very focused on what I was doing. In matchplay, you can’t get too far ahead of yourself. Every hole is so key that it keeps you a little bit more in the present.

Four up after nine holes on a chilly, sun-splashed afternoon at Dove Mountain, Kuchar fended off a Mahan resurgence after the turn before sealing the win at the par-four 17th where his opponent took four shots to reach the green. It was Kuchar’s fifth triumph on the PGA Tour and his first success in one of the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) events which bring together the game’s leading players. Defending champion Mahan, who had not trailed in any of his five previous matches this week, never recovered after going three down with a run of four consecutive bogeys from the par-three third. “I’m not sure I can explain how excited I am to have won this tournament,” the 34-year-old Kuchar told reporters, grinning broadly as he sat next to the cherished Walter Hagen Cup after earning the winner’s cheque for $1.5 million. “To come out on top after six matches of playing guys, the top 64 guys in the world, it’s an incredible feeling. “A lot of credit goes to Hunter for staying and fighting the way he did. That four-down deficit had to be tough for him at the turn where things could have easily gone quickly ... he really started playing some good golf.” Both players wore balaclavas as temperatures dropped to the mid-40s (F) with a wind chill factor of 37 and Mahan faltered early, bogeying the par-four fourth after failing to reach the green in two and hitting a poor chip 20 feet short. He also bogeyed the fifth, after taking three shots to reach the green, and the par-three sixth, where he three-putted from long range, to go three down. Kuchar went 4-up with a birdie at the par-five eighth, getting up and down from just off the back of the green while Mahan had to settle for a par after missing the green well to the left with his second shot. Mahan clawed one hole back with a two-putt par at the 10th, where Kuchar bogeyed, before recording his first birdie of the round at the par-five 11th to trim his opponent’s lead to 2up. As the chilly desert winds gusted up to 30 mph, Kuchar did well to birdie the par-three 12th where Mahan’s tee shot ended up just five feet from the pin, sinking a 14-footer to stay 2up. Both Americans failed to reach the green in two at the par-five 13th but Kuchar pitched up to five feet and coolly sank the birdie putt to regain a 3up advantage. Mahan immediately responded, hitting a pinpoint approach to within three feet of the flag at the par-four 14th for a conceded birdie as Kuchar was again pegged back to 2up. Though Mahan birdied the driveable par-four 15th, Kuchar matched him by sinking a slick 11-footer before coming unstuck with a bogey at the par-three 16th where his tee shot sailed into a grandstand. Both players ended up in the right fairway bunker off the tee at the par-four 17th but Mahan, from a relatively poor lie, struck his second shot under a bush in a waste bunker short of the green. Kuchar’s approach settled within five feet of the flagstick and he watched as Mahan blasted out of the bush for his ball to advance only a few feet. After chipping up to eight feet, Mahan conceded the hole and the match. “It was a long day,” said Mahan, a five-times winner on the PGA Tour who beat 2010 Match Play champion Ian Poulter 4&3 in the semi-finals earlier on Sunday. “Boy, conditions couldn’t have been harder, I don’t think. “I just had a bad stretch against Matt on the front nine there that put me just a little bit too far behind.” In the consolation match, Australian Jason Day beat Britain’s Poulter 1up to secure third place.

88,ACN,McIlroy and Woods went head to head after WGC exit,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Florida (Reuters) - Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy responded to their surprise early exit from last week’s WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship by going head to head in their own private challenge. World number two Woods and top-ranked McIlroy spent Sunday morning in a golfing duel at the Medalist club in Hobe Sound, Florida. “We thought we would play our own match play final except it was over 36 holes,” the Northern Irishman told reporters ahead of this week’s Honda Classic. “We had two matches. He beat me the first time and I beat him in the second so we’re even. We teed off at about 8:00 and I was home by 1:30 so we played quick,” added McIlroy. “He putts with the pin in...it’s speed golf. It was good, really enjoyable.” Former NFL player and television presenter Ahmad Rashad also played with the pair. McIlroy and American Woods have become friends in the past year, with the Northern Irishman now having a base near to the 14-times major winner in Florida and also having joined him in the Nike stable in January.

89,ACN,Woods against anchored putter despite PGA Tour stance,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Florida (Reuters) - Tiger Woods supports the idea of banning players from anchoring long putters to their body despite the PGA Tour’s recent public opposition to a proposal from golf’s rulemakers to outlaw the practice. Last November, the United States Golf Association (USGA) and the Royal and Ancient (R&A;) said they wanted to enforce the ban starting in 2016, but PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem came out against that plan last Sunday. Since Finchem’s comments, two of the leading names in the game, world number one Rory McIlroy and now Woods, have come out in favor of supporting the governing bodies. Finchem’s stance has raised fears of different regulations being in effect for the European Tour and the PGA Tour in the United States and Woods is among those concerned. “My position hasn’t changed. I still think it should be swung, it shouldn’t be anchored and that hasn’t changed at all,” Woods told reporters on Wednesday, after the Pro-Am ahead of the Honda Classic. “Obviously nothing is set in stone, nothing is firm. The USGA and the R&A; are the governing bodies of our rules and we will see what happens. “Hopefully we don’t have to bifurcate or adapt a local rule like we do sometimes out here on tour with stones and bunkers and things like that. Hopefully we won’t have to do that with the putter.” Three of the last five major tournaments have been won by players using long, or belly, putters - Keegan Bradley at the PGA Championship, Ernie Els at the British Open and Webb Simpson at the U.S. Open. With those three players all being full-time members of the PGA Tour, Woods said he understood Finchem’s stance but said it would not make him chance his view. “I understand that. I get it. All three of them play our tour full‑time, have won major championships with an anchored putter. I understand his position but I still feel that all 14 clubs should be swung. That hasn’t changed nor will it ever,” said the 14-times major winner. On Tuesday McIlroy urged the PGA Tour to fall in line with whatever decision is made by the two governing bodies. “We’ve trusted this game of golf; we’ve put it in the hands of the R&A; and the USGA for I don’t know how many years, and we’ve always abided by the rules that they have set,” McIlroy said. “I don’t think this should be any different. I think golf is pretty good at the minute and it’s in good hands.” But South African Els, who has used a long putter for the past year, praised Finchem for taking a stand. “You’ve got to give the commissioner credit, supporting his players and going against what the governing bodies want to do or might be doing,” he told reporters. “He came out and made his position very clear where the tour stands on that issue and obviously you’re going to have different kind of reactions around the world, but at least the rest of the world knows where he’s coming from and where what the tour stance is, and that was important to do.” ",2272013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-woods-putters/woods-against-anchored-putter-despite-pga-tour-stance-idUSBRE91Q10T20130227
90,ACN,"Still adjusting, McIlroy resumes battle with Woods","PALM BEACH GARDENS, Florida (Reuters) - World number one Rory McIlroy will be keen to dispel any doubts about the impact of his equipment change in this week’s Honda Classic where he comes up against a field featuring Tiger Woods. McIlroy is the defending champion at the PGA National course after a victory last year that sent him to the top of the world rankings for the first time. Since that win, where the Northern Irishman held off a late charge from Woods, McIlroy has claimed three more victories, including the PGA Championship. But last month, the 23-year-old switched his club brand from Titleist to Nike in a lucrative deal reported to be worth as much as $250 million over 10 years. Former world number one Nick Faldo called the change in club manufacturers “dangerous” and the concerns have hardly been eased given the two-times major winner’s slow start to the year. McIlroy has played just three professional rounds in three months, missing the cut in the Abu Dhabi Championship last month and suffering a first-round exit in the WGC-Accenture World Match Play Championship last week in Arizona. While there is plenty of speculation about how tricky he might be finding the adjustment to new clubs, McIlroy certainly is not feeling the pressure yet. “It’s fine, I knew coming into it was going to be a bit of a process and I knew it there was going to be comments if it didn’t happen for me right way,” he told reporters. “I’m only two tournaments into the season. I’ve still got 20 to go. So it’s not like I’m in any rush; it’s not like I’m pushing for answers or I’m looking for answers. Everything’s there. It’s just a matter of putting it all together.” McIlroy is not, of course, the first top player to have to adjust to the feel of new clubs after a commercial move, as Woods himself noted. “I went through equipment changes over the years, but as I said, it’s over the years,” said Woods. “There have been a lot of players who have done wholesale changes with sponsorships. I think Ernie (Els) has played for every company there is out there. There are a few guys who have done that and they have had a lot of success, and there are a lot of stories where they have not done well and been off the tour soon. “Rory, understandably, he’s going through the process. We talked about it a little bit. It is a process. The good news is about today’s equipment, we have so many different ways of testing it and tracking it and getting numbers, which back in the days ... that wasn’t the case.” Woods will be looking to recover from his own first round exit in Arizona to Charles Howell III, although he is not too worried about a loss in the matchplay format. “Generally if you’re missing a cut, you’re probably not playing that well. I actually played well, and only played one day,” said Woods. “He made a couple more birdies, and that’s just the nature of the business in that format.” McIlroy says he is still in “an adjustment period” but said he is more concerned with his swing than the feel of new clubs. “I would like to get back to where I was say the middle of last year,” said McIlroy. “Because if you put my swing now up the way I was swinging it last year, it’s chalk and cheese. So that’s the real thing that I’m working on.” The Honda Classic has grown in stature in recent years, largely thanks to the participation of McIlroy and Woods as part of a strong field. World number five Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa and his compatriot, British Open champion Ernie Els, are among the contenders along with English pair Justin Rose and Lee Westwood. Young Americans Keegan Bradley and Rickie Fowler and Australian Geoff Ogilvy will also be looking to make their mark ahead of next week’s WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral near Miami.

Cabrera-Bello put the theft of his personal possessions behind him en route to last week’s weather-hit Malaysian Open to finish tied-22nd and with a ranking of 65 he is closing in on a Masters’ debut with a place in the top 50. “The main reason I am here is to try to win this tournament and get into The Masters,” the Spaniard told the European Tour website (www.europeantour.com), with the April 11-14 Masters looming large on the horizon. “This is my last chance to do it this year, the last bullet in the chamber if you like, and I am going to give it my best shot,” added the twice European Tour winner. “Hopefully, I can continue to play well and if the door opens a little bit on Sunday afternoon here then I can take my chance.” The other four names who can book their Masters place with victory in Morocco are Scots Stephen Gallacher (64), Richie Ramsay (73) and Scott Jamieson (74) plus German Marcel Siem (72).

92,ACN,Sluggish corporate spending crimps Accenture forecast,"(Reuters) - Outsourcing and consulting services provider Accenture Plc reduced its forecast for revenue growth, as its consulting business continued to be hurt by a slowdown in corporate discretionary spending, especially in Europe. Accenture said it now expects revenue for the year ending August 31 to be below the midpoint of its forecast of 5-8 percent growth in local currency. “In terms of what we expected six months ago, we did expect that we would turn to growth in the second half in consulting faster than we are,” Chief Financial Officer Pamela Craig said on a conference call with analysts. Accenture said consulting revenue fell by about 1 percent to $3.8 billion in the second quarter, while outsourcing revenue rose 9 percent to $3.3 billion. “The forecast is a little disappointing, given the Street’s generally expecting Accenture to come in at the upper half of its guidance range,” Atlantic Equities analyst Christopher Hickey told Reuters. “It seems there’s an ongoing challenge of predicting some of the shorter-term consulting dynamics.” Craig, who retires in August, said consulting projects were coming in phases and chunks rather than as “giant” deals, and this was also affecting revenue. Accenture expects the consulting business to return to a growth of at least low positive single digits in the current quarter, with the trend continuing to the end of the year. The booking trend gives some comfort for a solid consulting recovery in the next few quarters, Hickey said. The company said it expected new bookings in the year to trend towards the upper half of its forecast of $31 billion to $34 billion. “The higher booking and lower revenue (forecasts) suggest slower book-to-bill conversion ratios for near future, though positive for long term growth,” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst James Friedman wrote in a note. Consulting bookings for the second quarter were $4.4 billion, compared with $4.05 billion a year earlier. A general rebound in discretionary spending by companies is not expected until the second half of the year, analysts have said. Accenture rivals such as Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp and Infosys Ltd reported growth in consulting revenue for the quarter ended December 31. Accenture, which has 261,000 employees worldwide, reiterated its full-year earnings forecast of $4.24-$4.32 per share. Analysts on average were expecting full-year earnings of $4.26 per share on revenue of $29.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Second-quarter net income rose to $1.19 billion, or $1.65 per share, from $714.2 million, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, it earned $1.00 per share. Second-quarter revenue rose 4 percent to $7.06 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 97 cents per share on revenue of $7.07 billion. The company said it repurchased or redeemed 8.8 million shares in the quarter, and its remaining repurchase authority was about $3.6 billion as of February 28. The company said Craig will be succeeded by David Rowland, senior vice president of finance. Accenture’s shares were up 1.38 percent at $75.92 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

98,ACN,Nicklaus tutorial gives Colsaerts a big Masters boost,"AUGUSTA, Georgia (Reuters) - Sometimes golfers just get lucky and Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts could not believe his good fortune after spending an hour last week chatting to golfing great Jack Nicklaus about how to play the Masters. Nicklaus has won a record six green jackets at Augusta National and the chance to pick the American’s brain was “one of the highlights of my humble golf-life experience”, Masters debutant Colsaerts later wrote on his official website. “I feel pretty lucky to have the chance to talk to someone like Jack Nicklaus for an hour, considering how his schedule is,” a smiling Colsaerts told reporters at a sun-splashed Augusta National on Monday. “We pretty much spoke about every hole. He told me about a few pin positions and a few shots that you might need to hit and the ones you don’t want to hit. “Usually when you play courses, you don’t really think about the shots you don’t want to hit; not as much as here. Here it takes a bigger part of your tactical approach to the course.” Nicknamed the ‘Belgian Bomber’ because of his prodigious length off the tee, Colsaerts readily admits the sage advice from Nicklaus had given him a massive jolt of confidence ahead of Thursday’s start of the year’s first major. “I felt like I had the place pretty well screened up for somebody that’s never played here,” the 30-year-old Belgian said of his acquired knowledge about Augusta National. “So if you add some of the useful information he’s given me, it’s actually given me quite a confidence boost and made sure that I had the right eyes on certain parts of the golf course.” Colsaerts had his initial look at Augusta National a month ago when he played the fabled back nine first and he is still savoring the special allure of the hilly layout. “Course-wise, it’s so much more subtle than I thought,” the double European Tour winner said. “You think after watching it for so many years (on TV) you have an idea of what it’s going to be like, but everything is accentuated a thousand times. “It’s very special here. It’s the tournament for me, and I can’t wait to see what I’m going to do in it.” Asked how he assessed his chances of victory this week, Colsaerts replied: “Certain players come here and look at this place and feel like they have the game that suits it, and I definitely think that I do. “Any tournament you win, you’re going to have to hole some putts. It might be a little more difficult to do out here because the greens are very different, but yeah ... I like my chances,” he said with a broad grin. Colsaerts, who announced himself to American golf fans with a stunning debut at last year’s Ryder Cup when he fired a 10-under-par 62 on his ball in his first match, is proud to become only the third Belgian to earn a Masters invitation. “It’s pretty special for a small country like us that doesn’t have a lot of golfers to have somebody represent a country and play in this very exclusive tournament,” he said. Flory Van Donck played in the 1958 Masters and Donald Swaelens qualified for the 1975 edition but had to withdraw after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Swaelens died on April 25, 1975 at the age of 34. ",4082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-masters-colsaerts/nicklaus-tutorial-gives-colsaerts-a-big-masters-boost-idUSBRE93710I20130408
99,ACN,Olesen waits on Masters cut after struggling on greens,"AUGUSTA, Georgia (Reuters) - Thorbjorn Olesen’s Masters debut was hanging by a thread on Friday despite a much improved performance in the second round by the Dane, who suffered whiplash in a car crash during the tournament buildup. The 23-year-old rebounded from an opening six-over-par 78 with a five-birdie 70 but said he had paid the price after struggling to cope with the slick, heavily contoured greens at Augusta National. “I gave it my best today,” Olesen told reporters after signing off in style with a 15-foot birdie putt at the uphill par-four last. “I hit a lot of great shots, but it’s probably going to be a couple too much,” he said of his four-over total of 148, which left him outside the early projected cutline. “I had the chances to make it, but I didn’t take them.” Olesen, who clinched his maiden European Tour title at last year’s Sicilian Open, felt he had produced good enough form from tee to green to contend in his first Masters. “I played some great golf yesterday, especially on the front nine, and I hit so many good shots,” he smiled. “But these greens are tricky. It’s my first time here and I didn’t really figure them out. “I hit a few bad shots on the back nine and got max punished for them. I’ve played well, but my short game has not been good enough this week.” Olesen had been in good form last month, finishing seventh at the PGA Tour’s Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill before he sustained whiplash in a car accident on the eve of the Houston Open. After battling to an opening 10-over 82 at Redstone Golf Club, he pulled out of the Houston Open before the start of the second round. “The neck is better, but I’m still on a lot of pills and getting a lot of treatment, so it’s not perfect, but I can play golf now,” Olesen said. “I’m very disappointed. “I’ve played really well. Obviously at Bay Hill I felt like my game was going the right way, and Houston in the practice round I was playing really well.

100,ACN,Garcia's fried chicken jibe 'hurtful' - Woods,"LONDON (Reuters) - The feud between world number one Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia deepened when Woods described the Spaniard’s “fried chicken” jibe as “wrong, hurtful and inappropriate” on Wednesday. Woods reacted on his Twitter account after Garcia issued an apology to a comment he made at Tuesday’s European Tour awards dinner when he was asked on stage whether he would be inviting Woods for dinner during next month’s U.S. Open in Merion. “We will have him round every night. We will serve fried chicken.” Garcia was heard to say. Fried chicken has become a racial stereotype in the United States when referring to African-Americans - a reference to the days before the abolition of slavery when chicken was believed to be a staple part of the diet. Garcia moved quickly to explain his remark, issuing an apology through the European Tour. “I apologise for any offence that may have been caused by my comment on stage during The European Tour Players’ Awards dinner,” the Spaniard said. “I answered a question that was clearly made towards me as a joke with a silly remark, but in no way was the comment meant in a racist manner.” Woods, whose relationship with Garcia is frosty at best, was in unforgiving mood, though, and took to Twitter to express his annoyance at the comment. “The comment that was made wasn’t silly. It was wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate...” the American said. Garcia’s comments echoed those made by former Masters winner Fuzzy Zoeller in 1997 when he joked with reporters to tell Woods not to ask for “fried chicken or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve” at the next year’s Champions dinner. Zoeller was subsequently dropped by two sponsors. Garcia and Woods have been at loggerheads after the Spaniard blamed a roar from the crowd watching the 14-times major winner for an errant shot when the two featured in the same group at the Players Championship in Florida. The gallery erupted during the Spaniard’s backswing upon seeing Woods reach for his five-wood for a daring escape from a tee shot deep into the trees.

101,ACN,Accenture cuts full-year outlook as consulting slows further,"(Reuters) - Outsourcing and consulting services provider Accenture Plc cut its full-year outlook, citing a pullback in spending by its consulting business clients, after reporting third-quarter revenue below analysts’ estimates. Shares of Accenture, whose clients include London’s Heathrow Airport, Nokia Oyj, Baker Hughes Inc and AstraZeneca UK, were down 7 percent at $74.60 in extended trading on Thursday. Clients were slowing the pace and level of spending on existing contracts, said Accenture, whose rivals include Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp and Infosys Ltd. The company expects outsourcing revenue to moderate, and consulting revenue to decline modestly or grow slightly in the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer David Roland said on a conference call with analysts. Accenture now expects adjusted earnings of $4.18 to $4.22 per share on revenue growth of 3 to 4 percent in local currency for the year ending August 31. The company in March had forecast adjusted annual earnings of $4.24 to $4.32 per share on a revenue growth rate below the midpoint of the 5-8 percent range it previously expected in local currency. The outlook assumed a negative currency impact of 1.7 percent, compared with a negative impact of 1 percent expected earlier. While there has been moderate improvement in discretionary spend in 2013, there was still softness in the consulting segment, particularly in Europe, Barclays analyst Darrin Peller wrote in a note. Accenture’s consulting net revenue dropped 2 percent to $3.9 billion in the three months ended May 31. Revenue from the business, which Accenture expected to return to growth, fell for the fourth straight quarter. Consulting bookings were almost $400 million lower than the company expected. Smaller contracts, which convert to revenue faster, declined. “It (consulting) definitely didn’t improve the way we expected and we see more softness in that part of the business in consulting smaller deals,” Accenture Chief Executive Pierre Nanterme said on the call. Outsourcing net revenue rose 4 percent to $3.3 billion in the quarter. Accenture’s results could have been worse without the strength in outsourcing, Edward Jones technology analyst Josh Olson told Reuters. Net revenue rose 0.6 percent to $7.2 billion. Net income rose to $874.1 million, or $1.21 per share, in the third quarter, from $762.8 million, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.14 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.13 per share on revenue of $7.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

103,ACN,US STOCKS-S&P; 500 posts best first half since 1998,"* S&P; 500 ends June lower, but positive for quarter * Accenture and BlackBerry both slide after results * Dow down 0.8 pct, S&P; 500 off 0.4 pct, Nasdaq up 0.04 pct By Alison Griswold NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 ended Friday’s session with its strongest first half of any year since 1998 after reaching record highs in May on a rally underpinned by the Federal Reserve’s massive monetary stimulus. While the S&P; 500 closed down for the month of June on concerns that the Fed might begin reducing its bond-buying program, the benchmark index ended the second quarter with a gain - marking its first positive second quarter in four years. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq also dipped in June, but rose in the second quarter. “I think the momentum that was established at the end of the first quarter kind of gave us a phenomenal start,” said Randy Billhardt, head of capital markets at MLV & Co. in New York. “The low interest-rate environment has really been the foundation of the stock market performance for this second quarter.” The Dow and the S&P; 500 fell in Friday’s volatile session, ending three straight days of gains. At the closing bell, the Nasdaq had eked out a tiny gain. Stocks opened lower on weakness in technology shares, then fluctuated between steep losses and moderate gains for much of the day. The losses were broad, with eight of the 10 S&P; 500 industrial sectors declining. Only utilities and consumer discretionary shares closed higher. Despite Friday’s ups and downs, analysts said volatility has decreased as investors have come to terms with the fact that the Federal Reserve’s stimulus program will eventually end. The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s favorite barometer of investor anxiety, fell nearly 11 percent in the past week. In Friday’s session alone, the VIX ended flat at 16.86. Volatility surged last week after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested the central bank could slow its $85 billion a month in bond purchases before the end of the year if the economy is strong enough. After two Fed speakers seemed to back away on Thursday from Bernanke’s comments, Fed Governor Jeremy Stein and Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker sounded a more aggressive tone on Friday on when the central bank’s unprecedented policy accommodation might be reduced. “The mixed signals from both the economic data and the Fed’s direction have caused a lot of anxiety and some opportunistic buying and selling, and it’s just created a much less predictive environment going forward,” said Steven Baffico, chief executive officer of Four Wood Capital Partners in New York. Both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq snapped a seven-month winning streak, while the Dow broke a six-month surge. For the month, the Dow fell 1.4 percent, the S&P; 500 lost 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 1.5 percent. Volume was the second highest of the year as some 10 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. Trading surged toward the close, with about half of the day’s shares traded in the last 30 minutes as investors anticipated a final update from Russell Investments for the annual reconstitution of its indexes. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 114.89 points or 0.76 percent, to end at 14,909.60. The S&P; 500 slipped 6.92 points or 0.43 percent, to finish at 1,606.28. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.38 points or 0.04 percent, to close at 3,403.25. Before Friday, the three major U.S. stock indexes had climbed for three straight days on diminished concern that the Federal Reserve would bring an imminent end to its $85 billion a month in bond purchases, known as quantitative easing. For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent, the S&P; 500 gained 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.4 percent. For the second quarter, the Dow gained 2.3 percent, the S&P; 500 advanced 2.4 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 4.2 percent. In Friday’s session, Accenture PLC dropped 10.3 percent to $71.96, making it the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 after the company cut its full-year outlook. The results also prompted investors to sell some shares of competitor International Business Machines. IBM’s stock fell 2.3 percent to $191.11. It was the biggest drag on the Dow. U.S.-listed shares of Research in Motion plunged 27.8 percent to $10.46 after the BlackBerry maker reported an unexpected quarterly operating loss, a dearth of details on sales of its make-or-break new line of devices and no return to profit expected in the current quarter.

Trading was volatile, with shares opening lower and falling steadily before rebounding. Technology shares were among the weakest of the day, pressured by weak corporate results, but the losses were offset by strength in energy and material shares. Cyclical groups, which includes materials and are tied to the pace of economic growth, have rallied this week on easing concerns that the Federal Reserve’s stimulus program - which has been widely credited with fueling the market’s gains this year -  would soon end. Last week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested the policy could be slowed if the economy improves, resulting in a sell-off of nearly 5 percent, though that subsequently dissipated on signs that the end of stimulus efforts wasn’t imminent. “The market is continuing to adjust as we try and figure out what’s going on with respect to Fed policy, and we should continue to see volatility as things gets sorted out,” said Rex Macey, who helps oversee $20 billion in assets as chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Atlanta, Georgia. “We’re cooling off a little bit after a few days of strong action. For the month of June, the Dow is down 0.8 percent, the S&P; is down 1.1 percent and the Nasdaq is down 1.4 percent. Both the S&P; and Nasdaq are on track to end a seven-month rally, while the Dow is on track to end a six-month jump. An index of technology shares fell 1.2 percent on Friday as the worst performing S&P; sector. Accenture PLC tumbled 13 percent to $69.76 as the biggest drag on the S&P; after cutting its full-year outlook. The results also put a dent in shares of competitor IBM, which dropped 3.3 percent to $189.17 as the biggest weight on the Dow. Energy and material shares advanced, with Newmont Mining  up 5.3 percent to $29.17 and Nextera Energy up 1.5 percent to $81.61. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 21.50 points, or 0.14 percent, at 15,002.99. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 0.19 point, or 0.01 percent, at 1,613.01. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 5.94 points, or 0.17 percent, at 3,407.80. The S&P; 500 is up 2.6 percent over the prior three sessions as economic data and comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials soothed worries over an earlier-than-expected reining in of stimulative bond purchases by the Fed. For the week, the index is up 1.3 percent, ending a two-week string of declines. The Dow is up 1.4 percent on the month while the Nasdaq is up 1.5 percent. For the second quarter, the Dow is up 2.9 percent, the S&P; is up 2.7 percent and the Nasdaq is up 4.3 percent. Newmont Mining was the S&P;’s weakest performer in the quarter, down 34 percent, while First Solar was the strongest, jumping 65 percent. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment was 84.1 points, slightly below a near six-year high of 84.5 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a final June reading of 82.8. The June Chicago Purchasing Management Index fell to 51.6 in June, below expectations.

Monte dei Paschi said in a statement the 1,100 workers involved will all be hired by the joint venture, in which Bassilichi has a 60 percent stake and Accenture the remaining 40 percent. The bank, which gave no financial details about the deal, has an 18-year contract with the joint venture starting in January.

114,ACN,Accenture expects consulting business to pick up,"(Reuters) - Accenture Plc said it expected its consulting business to turn the corner this financial year as orders rise, building on strength in its outsourcing unit that helped the company report better-than-expected quarterly results. Accenture shares rose as much as 5 percent on Thursday. “We think consulting could be flat to low single-digit positive (in the second quarter) ... we see the potential for building momentum in consulting as we go through the year,” Chief Financial Officer David Rowland said on a conference call. Consulting bookings rose to $4.3 billion in the first quarter from $4.2 billion a year earlier. Accenture’s consulting business has been hit in the past few quarters as companies cut down on discretionary spending. Revenue from the business has declined in five of the last six quarters. The company did report a rise in revenue from the business in the fourth quarter but said it was too early to say if that was sustainable. Revenue from the consulting business fell 1 percent to $3.94 billion in the quarter ended November 30. Rival IBM said in October that revenue from its services business, which consists of consulting and application management, was flat in the third quarter. Accenture’s outsourcing business has benefited, particularly in Europe, as companies cut costs amid patchy economic recovery. Revenue from the business increased 5 percent to $3.42 billion in the first quarter. Outsourcing accounted for 51 percent of total bookings in the quarter, up from 44 percent a year earlier. “They’ve set the stage well for their fiscal 2014. Now they need to execute,” Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. Accenture forecast current-quarter revenue below estimates. The company said it expected second-quarter revenue of $6.95 billion to $7.25 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $7.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, the company raised its earnings forecast range for the year ending August 31 by 2 cents to $4.44-$4.56 per share, saying it expects less impact from foreign exchange rates than previously estimated. Accenture said it expected at least 60,000 new employees in the fiscal year. The company had about 275,000 employees as of August 31. Net income rose to $811.6 million, or $1.15 per share, in the first quarter from $766 million, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2 percent to $7.36 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.09 per share on revenue of $7.25 billion. Accenture shares were up 4.4 percent at $78.95 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

117,ACN,U.S. to part with contractor CGI for Obamacare website,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government will part ways next month with contractor CGI Federal over the troubled Obamacare enrollment website, HealthCare.gov, which failed to work when it launched in October for millions of Americans shopping for insurance, the company said on Friday. HealthCare.gov struggled with error messages and slow speeds for weeks after its October 1 launch, creating a political crisis for President Barack Obama, threatening the roll-out of his signature healthcare law and emboldening its foes among Republican lawmakers to call for its repeal. CGI Federal, a subsidiary of CGI Group, built the website. Its contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency responsible for the roll out of the Affordable Care Act, was originally awarded in 2011 and is scheduled to end February 28. CMS would not confirm or deny CGI’s departure. “We are working with our contract partners to make a mutually agreed upon transition to ensure that HealthCare.gov continues to operate smoothly for consumers,” a CMS spokeswoman said. Obama has said the fiasco with HealthCare.gov has made him want to overhaul the way the federal government buys technology services. Critics say the system favors large, established contractors such as CGI. “At the end of the day, you have a company here that turned in subpar and visibly high-profile work. I think that that’s a fireable offense,” said Clay Johnson, chief executive officer of the Department of Better Technology, and former Presidential Innovation Fellow who has pushed for procurement reforms. But the government appears poised to replace CGI with another large contractor. The Washington Post, which first broke the news, reported that Accenture will get a year-long contract for the website worth about $90 million. The government’s dissatisfaction over the website’s early crashes, as well as aspects of the site that still do not work, prompted the switch, the Post reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. In an emailed statement, an Accenture spokesman said, “We are in discussions with clients and prospective clients all the time - but it is not appropriate to discuss new business opportunities we may or may not be pursuing.” Johnson called the news “disappointing” and pointed to examples of poorly managed Accenture contracts highlighted by the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group. For example, the company was publicly faulted by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers) for costly delays and other problems during a major IT overhaul, Johnson noted. “We’ll see how well they do, but Accenture doesn’t have a strong reputation of doing this stuff successfully,” Johnson said. Officials from the administration and CGI had assured Congress over the summer that HealthCare.gov would open on time and work as intended. At a September 10 hearing, CGI vice president Cheryl Campbell testified that the company “is confident that it will deliver the functionality that CMS has directed to enable qualified individuals to begin enrolling in coverage when the initial enrollment period begins on October 1.” Instead, the site failed to load, returned countless error messages, and generally thwarted the attempts of millions of users to create accounts, shop for coverage or enroll. The administration eventually acknowledged that the fault lay in hundreds of coding errors in the software CGI wrote, and the White House brought in trusted Obama aide Jeffrey Zients to fix the site by the end of November. The improvements allowed more than 1.1 million people to shop for and enroll in insurance on HealthCare.gov by the end of 2013, far short of original hopes for early enrollment. Although the site is vastly improved, technical glitches continue to bedevil enrollment. There are about 13,000 people who are now in a “caseworker system” to try to resolve particularly thorny technical issues, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. The website still lacks several “back end” features, such as a payment system for insurance companies. The deadline for signing up for 2014 health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is March 31, meaning the new contractor will take over at a time when the government needs the site to handle what it hopes will be a surge of last-minute sign-ups. “With only limited days to enroll, the government is rolling the dice, and the new vendor could be a savior or a bust if new problems arise,” said Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight. But Peter Neupert, an operating partner with Health Evolution Partners, a private equity firm that invests in health companies, said he did not think the switch in contractors likely would affect the website, which is now overseen by Kurt DelBene, a former Microsoft executive. “This appears to be about getting a new, hopefully better, team for the next few cycles of iteration,” Neupert said, noting he suspects DelBene will have a “transition plan” to manage the change. This is at least the second contract switch for HealthCare.gov. In November, CMS said it would not renew its contract with Verizon Communication Inc’s Terremark unit for computer servers hosting the troubled website and instead award a contract for that work to Hewlett-Packard Co. Terremark’s contract ends on March 30, the day before the sign-up deadline. The Terremark servers suffered at least one outage last fall that lasted for hours, making the website inaccessible. Despite the bad publicity from the website woes, two analysts said they did not expect CGI to take a significant hit from the end of the HealthCare.gov contract. “You could say what they’re losing in effect is this $90 million, 12-month contract, which in the context of a $10 billion revenue company is nothing,” said one of the analysts, who declined to be quoted by name. U.S.-listed shares of CGI Group closed at $31.58, down 2.9 percent. The second analyst said CGI might be better off to not be associated with the highly politicized project. “We will never hear CGI’s name associated with Obamacare, which, frankly, is a very, very good thing,” the analyst said.

123,ACN,Players ready for the unexpected at Dove Mountain,"(Reuters) - Unpredictability is the abiding theme for this week’s WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship at Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona where every player in the 64-man field is prepared to expect the unexpected. Because of the sheer lottery of the matchplay format, good form does not guarantee success in Wednesday’s opening round and a player could easily be sent packing despite piling up a bunch of birdies in a bogey-free display. “We know you can shoot 64 and someone else shoot 63 and you’re going home,” Swedish world number three Henrik Stenson told reporters at Dove Mountain on Tuesday. “You can shoot 74 and you still squeeze by because the other guy is having a worse day than you are having. “You’ve got to be able to squeeze by on the matches when you’re not playing that well. Hopefully you’ll win the ones where you’re playing well. It’s all about timing in that sense.” Stenson is the tournament’s top seed with world number one Tiger Woods and second-ranked Australian Adam Scott opting not to play in the first of the year’s four WGC events. He said he felt no added pressure due to his elevated status. “I don’t think it makes a difference for me here,” explained the 37-year-old Swede. “If you’re going to have a good week, you need to play well. “You need to have better luck on your side and it doesn’t really matter if you’re No. 1 seed or if you’re No. 50 coming into this week.” Stenson, who ended a stellar 2013 campaign by topping the European Tour’s money list after also securing FedExCup honours on the PGA Tour, will come up against Thailand’s Kiradech Aphibarnrat in the first round. Former world number one Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland, who was beaten by American Hunter Mahan in the 2012 final, said the event’s unpredictability made it very difficult to hold any expectations for the week. “What is a good week? You could shoot 67 tomorrow and be going home,” said McIlroy, 24. “It’s hard to know. You have to take one match at a time. “The year that I got to the final here, I didn’t play very well the first three days and then my game started to come around. I played well in the quarters, the semis and the final, as well. “It’s just one of those formats ... someone can get hot and that can be it. Expectations, I’ve just got to go out and try to beat whoever I’m up against,” added McIlroy, who meets American Boo Weekley in the opening round. Mahan, who also reached the final last year before losing to compatriot Matt Kuchar 2&1, was delighted be back at a venue where he has produced a lot of winning golf. “Excited to be here, excited about this event,” said Mahan, who will face Spaniard Gonzalo Fenz-Castano on Wednesday. “Obviously I enjoy this golf course. It’s a lot of fun to play. “Wherever you’re drawn, you’re going to have to beat some good players. Who you may go up against (next) isn’t really relevant and it’s who you go up against (on the day). “One year I had to beat Steve Stricker and Matt Kuchar and Rory McIlroy. You’re going to have to beat some great players no matter who you have to play or what bracket you’re in.” Stenson, U.S. Open champion Justin Rose of England, American Zach Johnson and double major winner McIlroy are the top seeds in the four groups of 16 for this week’s tournament. For a sixth consecutive year, the elite event that brings together the world’s best players will be held on the 7,791-yard layout at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club.

124,ACN,"Early Match Play wins for Walker, Watson and Fowler","(Reuters) - Jimmy Walker, arguably the hottest player in the game, drew first blood at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship with a commanding 5&4 win over South Africa’s Branden Grace in Marana, Arizona on Wednesday. American Walker, who has already triumphed three times on the 2013-14 PGA Tour, never trailed in his first-round match at Dove Mountain before sealing victory with a 15-foot birdie putt at the par-four 14th. He will next play fellow American Rickie Fowler, who pulled off an upset 2&1 win over matchplay expert and 2010 champion Ian Poulter of England. In other early matches, Bubba Watson clawed his way back from two down after 12 holes to battle past Finland’s Mikko Ilonen 2&1 while South African George Coetzee won 3&1 against a rusty Steve Stricker. Walker, making his debut in the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event, was delighted to maintain his red-hot early season form. “I played pretty solid all day, hit a lot of really good shots, made some birdie putts,” Walker told reporters. “You’ve got to go out and continue to hit good shots and make good putts. “Branden had a couple of three-putts early in the round and that got me up to a pretty good little lead. Just kind of stayed nice and steady and then closed it off with two birdies there at the end.” Fowler took advantage of a sub-par performance by Poulter, who is renowned for his steely matchplay prowess, especially in the Ryder Cup. “I knew it was going to be a tough match today, no matter if Poulter is not on his game,” said Fowler. “He wasn’t playing great today, but I knew he was going to find a way to hang around. “Obviously it feels good to get a win against him, against anyone. I’m excited for tomorrow.” Fowler knows he will have his hands full against Walker, who won the season-opening Frys.com Open in October before adding further victories at the Sony Open in January and the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am earlier this month. “He’s best player in the world right now, coming off three wins,” said Fowler. “He’s going to be tough to beat. I’ll have to be on top of my game and make some putts.” Left-hander Watson, who clinched his fifth PGA Tour title at the Northern Trust Open on Sunday, was relieved to pull out a comeback win with four birdies in his last five holes. “I fought hard,” said Watson. “My caddie just said, ‘Keep going, keep going, give me one hole, give me one hole.’ He kept pushing me and somehow it came out to me winning. “It’s a just short week. You have one less day than normal to prepare, so the energy level is just not where I want it to be. Hopefully some rest today ... be ready tomorrow.” In other matches, former world number one Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland was all square with American Boo Weekley after five holes while top-seeded Swede Henrik Stenson was one up on Thailand’s Kiradech Aphibarnrat after one.

However, English levelled the match with a birdie at the par-four 17th and sealed victory after his opponent made a compete hash of the 19th. “Obviously a little bit disappointed with how I finished,” McIlroy told reporters. “Being two down with five to go, playing the last five holes like I did, I was happy about that. “I didn’t hit the greatest drive off the 19th and got a pretty bad lie in the rough. It was just unfortunate. I played pretty well for the most part. “But, you know, he played really solid today and didn’t really do much wrong, didn’t really give me anything. So the more consistent player won at the end of the day.” English will next face Jim Furyk, the PGA Tour veteran having beaten former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of South Africa 3&2. Oosthuizen won three of the first four holes against a sub-par Stenson and maintained control before ending the match with a birdie at the par-four 15th. “I played pretty solid today,” Oosthuizen said. “I just kept it together. Henrik didn’t start very well and I made an early lead. “I just played solid and made nice putts on the back nine. I’m playing well. I’m just trying to keep the ball in play so that I’m in every hole I’m playing.” GIANT-KILLING WAYS Rickie Fowler continued his giant-killing ways with a one-up win over in-form fellow American Jimmy Walker and will next meet Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who beat good friend Bill Haas of the United States 3&1. Fowler came from one down with three holes to play, sealing his second win of the week with a birdie on 16 followed by well executed par saves on 17 and 18. “I told my caddie, ‘Joe, let’s try and birdie the last three, make some good swings’,” Fowler said. “I didn’t birdie 17 and 18, but I made two really good putts along with the birdie putt on 16.” Fowler, who upset match play expert and 2010 champion Ian Poulter in the opening round, was delighted to add the scalp of Walker, who has already won three times on the 2013-14 PGA Tour. “He’s on top of his game,” Fowler said. “I knew coming in today that even if he didn’t bring his ‘A’ game, he was going to be tough to beat. Definitely nice to come out on top.” Garcia, who had battled past Australian Marc Leishman after 22 holes in his opening match, was two down after seven holes but sparked his fightback with an eagle at the eighth before taking control with three birdies after the turn. American Jordan Spieth, the 2013 PGA Tour rookie of the year, was always in command against Denmark’s Thomas Bjorn before wrapping up a comfortable 5&4 victory. Frenchman Victor Dubuisson, a debutant at Dove Mountain this week, never trailed on the way to a 3&1 win against Swede Peter Hanson. Dubuisson will next face former Masters champion Bubba Watson, who beat Swede Jonas Blixt two up. Defending champion Matt Kuchar won a tight contest against fellow American Ryan Moore one up while Australian Jason Day battled back from three down after 10 holes to scrape past American Billy Horschel after 22 holes.

127,ACN,Early Match Play exits for Poulter and Donald,"(Reuters) - Unpredictability was again a recurring theme at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship as former champions Ian Poulter and Luke Donald of England, and American Zach Johnson, were all eliminated in Wednesday’s first round. While American Jimmy Walker maintained his red-hot form this season with a commanding 5&4 win over South Africa’s Branden Grace, matchplay expert and 2010 winner Poulter was upset 2&1 by American Rickie Fowler in the 64-player event at Dove Mountain. Donald, who clinched the 2011 title, was hammered 5&4 by Italy’s Matteo Manassero and world number six Johnson, the tournament’s third seed who is known for his gritty play, was stunned 5&4 by South Africa’s Richard Sterne. Long-hitting Dustin Johnson, who has triumphed once and been a runner-up twice in just four starts on the 2013-14 PGA Tour, also made an unexpected early exit, going down 4&3 to Swede Peter Hanson. In total, there were nine upsets based on seedings from the 32 matches at Dove Mountain as the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event once again lived up to its reputation for wild uncertainty and sharp swings in fortune. Fowler took advantage of a sub-par performance by Poulter, who is renowned for his steely matchplay prowess, especially in the Ryder Cup. “I knew it was going to be a tough match today, no matter if Poulter is not on his game,” Fowler told reporters. “He wasn’t playing great, but I knew he was going to find a way to hang around. “Obviously it feels good to get a win against him, against anyone. I’m excited for tomorrow.” Poulter, who succumbed to his third first-round exit in four years at Dove Mountain, wrote on Twitter: “Disappointed with my performance today do not deserve to move on. Congrats to @RickieFowlerPGA.” Fowler will next face his compatriot Walker, a debutant at Dove Mountain this week who is arguably the hottest player in the game after already securing three tournament wins on the PGA Tour this season. “I played pretty solid all day, hit a lot of really good shots, made some birdie putts,” said Walker, who sealed his victory over Grace with a 15-foot birdie putt at the par-four 14th. “Branden had a couple of three-putts early in the round and that got me up to a pretty good little lead. Just kind of stayed nice and steady and then closed it off with two birdies there at the end.” The top two seeds advanced, Swedish world number three Henrik Stenson coming from one down after 13 holes to edge Thailand’s Kiradech Aphibarnrat 2&1 and fifth-ranked Englishman Justin Rose battling past American Scott Piercy one up. “I’m still in shock,” said Stenson, the 2007 Match Play champion who is top seed this week with world number one Tiger Woods and second-ranked Australian Adam Scott opting not to play in the elite WGC event. “It was a tough match. Kiradech is a good player. We both played well in the beginning. It was a bit back and forth there.” U.S. Open champion Rose was also delighted to advance after trailing one down after 10 holes. “I’m very happy to come through that match,” said the Englishman, who has been recovering from tendinitis in his right shoulder. “It wasn’t a classic, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s all about doing enough on the day to get the match won.” Fourth-seeded Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy celebrated his first start on the PGA Tour this year with a 3&2 win over American Boo Weekley and former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel triumphed by the same margin over Kevin Stadler. American Jordan Spieth, the 2013 PGA Tour rookie of the year, came from one down after seven holes to beat Spaniard Pablo Larrazabal two up while defending champion Matt Kuchar eased past Austria’s Bernd Wiesberger 3&2. American Bill Haas hammered Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez 4&3, Frenchman Victor Dubuisson crushed American Kevin Streelman 5&4 and veteran Dane Thomas Bjorn never trailed before beating Italy’s Francesco Molinari 2&1.

128,ACN,"Oosthuizen, Furyk and Garcia reach last eight","(Reuters) - South African Louis Oosthuizen delivered a sizzling display of golf to become the first player to reach the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship quarter-finals with a commanding 5&4 victory over American Webb Simpson on Friday. Former British Open champion Oosthuizen, who upset top-seeded Swede Henrik Stenson in the previous round, was a flawless six under for the day when he sealed the win at the par-four 14th. Oosthuizen eagled the par-five second, then added four birdies to tighten his grip on the third-round encounter at Dove Mountain. “I’m playing some of my best (golf) now,” Oosthuizen told reporters. “I’m hitting the ball really good and just need to make the putts. “I made quite a few birdies coming in, and he put himself in a few tough spots off the tee to make bogeys and pars. My golf has been really solid.” PGA Tour veteran Jim Furyk and fellow American Rickie Fowler also reached the last eight, both after staging impressive fightbacks. Furyk came from three down after six holes to win a hotly contested match with compatriot Harris English one up, making sure of the win with birdies at 16 and 17 before booking his place in the quarter-finals with a matching par at the 18th. Fowler, who upset 2010 champion Ian Poulter and in-form American Jimmy Walker in his first two matches, rallied from three down after eight holes to pip Spaniard Sergio Garcia one up. Fowler piled up five birdies in the last 10 holes to seize control and will take on Furyk in Saturday’s quarter-finals. In other third-round matches, Australian Jason Day was two up on South African George Coetzee after 15 holes and Jordan Spieth was one up on fellow American and defending champion Matt Kuchar after 13.

129,ACN,"Match Play exits for Stenson, Rose and McIlroy","(Reuters) - The sheer lottery of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship was again front and center on Thursday as top seeds Henrik Stenson, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose were all eliminated in the second round. Swede Stenson, seeded one this week, never led before going down 4&3 to South African Louis Oosthuizen while fourth-seeded Northern Irishman McIlroy lost a see-sawing encounter with American Harris English after 19 holes. In the final match of the day at Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona, U.S. Open champion and second seed Rose was pipped by Els after 20 closely contested holes, the big South African sealing victory with a magical birdie at the par-five second. Former world number one Els somehow struck his third shot from a near-impossible lie in a greenside bunker to within three feet of the flag before Rose needed two strokes to escape the sand on the way to a losing par five on their 20th hole. McIlroy, beaten by American Hunter Mahan in the 2012 final, had clawed his way back from two down after 13 holes to edge one up after 16 on another breezy day of dazzling sunshine in Arizona’s high desert.

Henrik didn’t start very well and I made an early lead. I’m playing well.

130,ACN,"Day, Fowler, Els and Dubuisson into last four","(Reuters) - Jason Day and Ernie Els advanced with relative ease while American Rickie Fowler and Frenchman Victor Dubuisson had to fight hard to reach the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship semi-finals in Marana, Arizona on Saturday. Australian Day beat ailing South African Louis Oosthuizen 2&1 to become the first player to make the last four at Dove Mountain while veteran Els progressed with a 4&2 win over an out-of-sorts Jordan Spieth in a match where he never trailed. Fowler booked his place with a see-sawing, one-up victory over fellow American Jim Furyk, who came from three down after 12 holes to go one up after 16 before running out of steam, and Dubuisson edged Northern Ireland’s Graeme McDowell one up. “Jim started to come on pretty hard there, I just had to stay patient,” Fowler told CBS Sports. “I forced him to make some birdies. I knew it was going to be tough for him to keep on doing that. “I just made some good swings coming in. Obviously it’s nice to get a win, no matter how it happens.” Fowler will next face Dubuisson while Day, beaten by eventual champion Matt Kuchar of the United States in last year’s semi-finals, will take on South African Els. Dubuisson, making his debut this week in a World Golf Championships (WGC) event, rallied from two down after three holes against McDowell with five birdies over the next 12 to wrest control. McDowell, who had delivered Houdini-like escapes to win his first three matches, faced a mid-range birdie putt at the 18th to force extra holes but his attempt slid past the left edge of the cup allowing the Frenchman to advance. Day had trailed by one after Oosthuizen made a fast start with birdies at the second and third but then upped his game to take charge as his opponent had periodic back treatment from his physiotherapist out on the course. “We both played well today ... it didn’t seem like Louis had a sore back because the way he played was pretty good,” Day said after finishing birdie-birdie-par-par. “I’ve loved match play ever since I was a little kid. You just have to grind at it and keep fighting until the end.” RED-HOT PUTTER Fowler, wielding a red-hot putter, birdied three of the first four holes to go three up on Furyk before his opponent briefly cut the deficit to one by winning the sixth and seventh holes. Birdies at the ninth and 11th got Fowler back to three up but Furyk again rallied, leveling the match with three consecutive birdies from the par-five 13th. PGA Tour veteran Furyk briefly went one up with a par at the short 16th, where Fowler bogeyed, but then stumbled when he bogeyed the par-four 17th after being bunkered off the tee for the match to reach the 18th all square. After Fowler had comfortably reached the green in two, Furyk duffed his chip from just short of the putting surface on the way to another bogey as his opponent wrapped up victory with a two-putt par. “I played well,” said Furyk. “I’m honestly disappointed with the finish. I hit some good shots down the stretch. I don’t feel I handed the match away, but I definitely made it too easy on the last two holes.” Former world number one Els, at 44 bidding to become the oldest Match Play champion, produced his best golf of the week as he went one up at the second and never relinquished control. “I played relatively solid golf,” said Els, who won the first of his two U.S. Open titles in 1994 when Spieth was just 10 months old. “I had a pretty nice start, I made a couple of birdies early. I felt like I played OK. “I got it up and down when I needed to. I am fortunate to go through. Jordan was a bit off.” The semi-finals will be played on Sunday morning with the 18-hole final scheduled to take place later in the day.

131,ACN,Ailing Oosthuizen goes out in last eight at Dove Mountain,"(Reuters) - South Africa’s Louis Oosthuizen had been one of the standout players at this week’s WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship but was ousted in the quarter-finals on Saturday after struggling with an ailing back. Oosthuizen, who was sidelined for almost three months last year with a lingering neck and back injury, lost 2&1 to Australian Jason Day after receiving periodic treatment from his physiotherapist out on the course. “I was a bit disappointed to start this morning on the range not feeling too good,” former British Open champion Oosthuizen told reporters. “It got better the last four or five holes and I felt a lot better. “It’s just a bit painful that it always happens when I’m playing well. I need to address it big time now and get it sorted.” Oosthuizen, who clinched his only major title with a commanding seven-stroke victory at the 2010 British Open, had upset top-seeded Swede Henrik Stenson 4&3 in the second round before crushing American Webb Simpson 5&4 on Friday. “I felt I played really well (today) but you can’t give away holes to a guy like Jason, you’re not going to get them back,” said the 31-year-old South African. “I had a tough start and it was really tough to get back. He played really well.” Asked how much back pain he had suffered during his quarter-final match, Oosthuizen replied: “The walking was quite affecting it today. If I can commit myself to hit the shot it’s not that bad, but I can’t commit. “My body is restricting me to go through the shot. So I just hit a few iron shots that I really stuck down and committed, and hit great shots - the third shot on 11 and things like that. “It’s irritating to play something like that in the back of your head. But I’m not making any excuses. Jason played really well.” Oosthuizen, who won his seventh European Tour title at the Volvo Golf Champions in his native South Africa in January, endured a frustrating 2013 campaign because of his persistent back and neck problems. He had to withdraw after three rounds of the Byron Nelson Championship in May, pulled out of the U.S. Open the following month after opening with a 75 and lasted just six holes at the British Open in July before calling it quits. Oosthuizen only returned to competitive golf at the European Tour’s Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in late September after being sidelined with injury since July.

132,ACN,"Oosthuizen cruises, McDowell again Houdini-like","(Reuters) - South African Louis Oosthuizen coasted in sizzling style while Americans Jim Furyk and Rickie Fowler both staged thrilling comebacks to reach the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship quarter-finals in Marana, Arizona on Friday. Also advancing into the last eight were Frenchman Victor Dubuisson, making his debut this week in a World Golf Championships event, and Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell, after a third successive Houdini-like escape at Dove Mountain. Former British Open champion Oosthuizen, who upset top-seeded Swede Henrik Stenson in the previous round, was a flawless six under for the day when he sealed a commanding 5&4 victory over American Webb Simpson. Oosthuizen, who has been one of the standout players all week, eagled the par-five second and then added four birdies to tighten his grip on the third-round encounter. “I’m playing some of my best (golf) now,” Oosthuizen told reporters. “I’m hitting the ball really good and just need to make the putts. “I made quite a few birdies coming in, and he put himself in a few tough spots off the tee to make bogeys and pars. My golf has been really solid.” Oosthuizen will next meet Australian Jason Day, who never trailed on the way to a comfortable 3&1 win against South African George Coetzee. PGA Tour veteran Furyk and emerging talent Fowler also reached the last eight, but both had their work cut out before they advanced. Furyk came from three down after six holes to win a hotly contested match with compatriot Harris English one up, making sure of the win with birdies at 16 and 17 before recording a matching par at the 18th. “Just steady play,” said Furyk, 43, after reaching the last eight for the first time in 14 starts at the elite WGC event. “I really hit a lot of greens, a lot of fairways, gave myself a lot of opportunities. “It was a tough match. He played real well early on and I played real well, chipped in on 18 and that’s what gave me the one-up victory.” Fowler, who upset 2010 champion Ian Poulter and in-form American Jimmy Walker in his first two matches, rallied from three down after eight holes to pip Spaniard Sergio Garcia one up. The American piled up five birdies in the last 10 holes to seize control and will take on Furyk in Saturday’s quarter-finals. “I knew I had my work cut out for me, and I gave it the best fight I could,” said Fowler. “We’ve had a lot of fun playing together. We did out there today, as well.” McDowell, taken to 19 holes in his opening match and 18 in his second as he had to rally in both, came from two down after 16 holes to edge American Hunter Mahan after 21. The Northern Irishman won the 17th and 18th, sank a 20-footer for par at the 20th to stay in the match and then sealed his third remarkable victory this week with a birdie at the 21st. “I really don’t know what to say,” former U.S. Open champion McDowell said after emerging triumphant in a re-match of his decisive singles clash with Mahan at the 2010 Ryder Cup, also won by the Northern Irishman. “Obviously I’m holing some very important putts that I really can’t give my normal reactions to, because I can scarcely believe what’s going on. I’m not embarrassed, but I just feel like I’m robbing these guys.” McDowell will next meet Dubuisson, who beat former Masters champion Bubba Watson one up in an erratic match that featured just six birdies between them. Jordan Spieth, 20, ousted fellow American and defending champion Matt Kuchar in a match of high quality, completing a 2&1 victory with his ninth birdie of the day at the par-four 17th. Veteran South African Ernie Els, who edged second-seeded Englishman Justin Rose after 20 holes in the previous round, beat PGA Championship winner Jason Dufner one up and will next take on Spieth, an opponent less than half his age.

133,ACN,Fowler stunned by Garcia concession on 17-foot putt,"(Reuters) - Sergio Garcia was ousted by American Rickie Fowler in the third round of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship on Friday in a match that will be remembered for a surprise concession by the Spaniard on the seventh hole. Garcia, who had been two up after six holes, conceded a 17-foot par putt on the seventh green after feeling he had taken too long to take a drop from a sprinkler head on the previous hole with bees buzzing around his ball. A stunned Fowler, in return, conceded the Spaniard’s seven-footer for par to halve the hole and went on to win the match one up at Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona. “I don’t regret it at all,” Garcia told reporters about his generous act of sportsmanship. “He played much better than me on the last 10 holes and he deserves a win. “This is a gentleman’s game, and lately it hasn’t felt like it’s been like that. This is the way I was brought up by my dad, playing golf. “At least I can leave here feeling good, even though I lost. And that’s all there is to it.” Fowler, who came from three down after eight holes with five birdies over the closing stretch, was initially uncertain about what was happening on the seventh green. “I had to kind of find out what he was asking or offering there,” said the American. “Took me a few (minutes) to kind of realize. And obviously I’d be stupid to not take a half. “I was outside of him. He had a good look for par. He had the advantage there. Anything could have happened. I was ready to make the putt, put the pressure on him. “He made a good birdie on eight to go three up. I knew I had my work cut out for me, and I gave it the best fight I could.” Fowler said that Garcia had explained the reason for his surprise concession as they made their way to the eighth tee. “He felt like he had a little bit of a load on his chest after taking a little time with the drop on (hole) six,” said Fowler. “I really didn’t have a problem with it. “He just said, ‘I felt like I took too much time.’ I was like, ‘Sure, whatever.’ I’ve gotten to know Sergio quite a bit over the last year. “We’ve played numerous rounds together. We’ve been paired a lot Thursdays and Fridays and into some weekends. We’ve had a lot of fun playing together. We did out there today, as well.” ",2222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-garcia/fowler-stunned-by-garcia-concession-on-17-foot-putt-idUSBREA1L01420140222
134,ACN,Day to face Dubuisson in Match Play final,"(Reuters) - Australian Jason Day held off a late fightback by American Rickie Fowler to book his place in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final with a 3&2 victory in a battle of the young guns at Dove Mountain on Sunday On a crisp and clear morning in Arizona’s high desert, Day sealed the win when fellow 25-year-old Fowler surprisingly three-putted from just five feet at the par-three 16th. Day, who recorded six birdies in 16 holes to reach the final for the first time, will face Frenchman Victor Dubuisson in the title match later on Sunday at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club. Dubuisson, who had never previously played matchplay golf until his debut this week in a World Golf Championships (WGC) event, came from three down after seven holes to beat veteran South African Ernie Els one up. “It was a tough day,” Day, who was beaten by eventual champion Matt Kuchar of the United States in last year’s semi-finals, told Golf Channel. “Rickie is playing great golf right now and I just thought if I gave that little bit of an inch for him to move in, he was going to knock the door down. “So I was just trying to hang tough and my game was solid today. Hopefully I can take it into the final.” Day birdied four of the first eight holes to go three up before Fowler twice trimmed the lead to two, first with a concession at the ninth and again at the short 12th, where Day missed a seven-foot par putt. The Australian also bogeyed the 13th for his advantage to be cut to one before getting back to two-up with a birdie at the driveable par-four 15th, where he chipped to three feet. Fowler responded with a brilliant tee shot to five feet at the 16th but squandered the chance to level when he pushed his birdie attempt to the right of the cup, then missed the par putt coming back to lose the match. In the second semi-final, four-times major winner Els raced into a three-up lead after just four holes against a slow-starting Dubuisson before the Frenchman got into his stride with birdies at the eighth and ninth to trail by one. Dubuisson leveled the match with another birdie at the par-five 11th, where he chipped to within three feet, and went one ahead when his 44-year-old opponent bogeyed the 12th. It looked likely that Els would get back to all square after he hit a stunning approach to a foot for a conceded birdie at the par-five 13th, but Dubuisson coolly matched him by sinking a clutch putt there from 18 feet. However, the Frenchman stumbled at the par-four 14th where he failed to reach the green in two, executed a poor chip and ran his par putt well past the cup before conceding the hole. Dubuisson got back to one up with a birdie at the 15th where his tee shot ended up just short of the green but Els immediately leveled when he stunningly drained a curling downhill birdie putt from 32 feet at the 16th. Both players parred the 17th but the South African lost the match on the 18th green when he missed his par putt from 13 feet after the Frenchman had lagged his birdie putt to within two feet of the cup. Dubuisson, who burst into the limelight by winning his maiden European Tour title at the Turkish Airlines Open in November, admitted he had been very nervous competing against one of his golfing idols. “I didn’t sleep very well last night, I slept like one hour, and this morning I woke up and I realized that I was playing against Ernie Els, one of my favorite players,” the 23-year-old said. “On the first tee. I shake the hand of Ernie and I wasn’t feeling comfortable. I was watching him and I was very impressed to be next to him. I was thinking of all the matches he won and the (two British) Opens.” ",2232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-semis/day-to-face-dubuisson-in-match-play-final-idUSBREA1M0Z520140223

Fowler booked his place with a see-sawing, one-up victory over fellow American Jim Furyk, who came from three down after 12 holes to go one up through 16 before running out of steam, and Dubuisson edged Northern Ireland’s Graeme McDowell one up. “Jim started to come on pretty hard there, I just had to stay patient,” Fowler, the 53rd seed in a starting field of 64, told CBS Sports. “I forced him to make some birdies. I knew it was going to be tough for him to keep on doing that. “I just made some good swings coming in. Obviously it’s nice to get a win, no matter how it happens.” Day, beaten by eventual champion Matt Kuchar of the United States in last year’s semi-finals, will next face fellow 25-year-old Fowler in a battle of ‘young guns’ while the 23-year-old Dubuisson will take on South African Els, aged 44. Dubuisson, who had never previously played matchplay golf until his debut this week in a World Golf Championships (WGC) event, rallied from two down after three holes against McDowell with five birdies over the next 12 to wrest control. “I played well today,” said world number 30 Dubuisson, who burst into the limelight by winning his maiden European Tour title at the Turkish Airlines Open in November where Tiger Woods and U.S. Open champion Justin Rose were in the field. “I knew Graeme was going to be a tough player to beat. I didn’t watch him too much. I tried to just focus on my game and I try to make birdies.” McDowell, who had delivered Houdini-like escapes to win his first three matches, faced a 25-foot birdie putt at the 18th to force extra holes but his attempt slid past the left edge of the cup allowing the Frenchman to advance. Day had trailed by one after Oosthuizen made a fast start with birdies at the second and third but then upped his game to take charge as his opponent had periodic back treatment from his physiotherapist out on the course. “We both played well today ... it didn’t seem like Louis had a sore back because the way he played was pretty good,” Day said after finishing birdie-birdie-par-par. “We both fought hard until the finish. Hopefully I can do a little better this year and press for that (Match Play title) win.” RED-HOT PUTTER Fowler, wielding a red-hot putter, birdied three of the first four holes to go three up on Furyk before his opponent briefly cut the deficit to one by winning the sixth and seventh holes. Birdies at the ninth and 11th got Fowler back to three up but Furyk again rallied, leveling the match with three consecutive birdies from the par-five 13th. PGA Tour veteran Furyk briefly went one up with a par at the short 16th, where Fowler bogeyed, but then stumbled when he bogeyed the par-four 17th after being bunkered off the tee for the match to reach the 18th all square. After Fowler had comfortably reached the green in two, Furyk duffed his chip from just short of the putting surface on the way to another bogey as his opponent wrapped up victory with a two-putt par. Former world number one Els, bidding to become the oldest Match Play champion, produced his best golf of the week as he went one up at the second and never relinquished control to reach the semi-finals for the first time in 13 years. “I played relatively solid golf,” said Els, who won the first of his two U.S. Open titles in 1994 when Spieth was just 10 months old. “I had a pretty nice start, I made a couple of birdies early. I felt like I played OK. “I got it up and down when I needed to. I am fortunate to go through. Jordan was a bit off.” The semi-finals will be played on Sunday morning with the 18-hole final scheduled to take place later in the day.

136,ACN,Hard work finally pays off for Day with second PGA Tour win,"(Reuters) - Jason Day had heard all the criticism, that a player of his undoubted talent should have won a lot more than just one PGA Tour title even though he is just 26. It felt like a long time coming but finally, on Sunday at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, the Australian secured his second victory on the U.S. circuit by beating Frenchman Victor Dubuisson after 23 holes. “I’ve worked very, very hard in the off-season,” Day told reporters after knocking in a four-foot birdie putt to clinch a one-up win in the title match at Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona. “I’ve worked very hard on my physical fitness and mental fitness and it certainly paid off this week at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. “It feels like it’s been a long time coming since my last win. I’ve heard things in the media saying he’s only got one win.” Day’s maiden PGA Tour victory came at the 2010 Byron Nelson Championship, and he had come very close to adding a second before this week and made a habit of performing at his best when the pressure was at its most intense. Since he turned professional in 2006, he has recorded six top-10s at the majors, including three runner-up spots. In November, he won the coveted World Cup of Golf by two strokes at Royal Melbourne, along with the team title in partnership with Adam Scott. “I’ve had a lot of consistent finishes in big events and obviously I said to myself I’ve got to keep working hard and work, work, work, work, work smart,” said Day. “As long as I don’t give up and keep pushing through, it (a win) will happen again, and hopefully happen in bunches. “It took me nearly three years, I guess. I got my second win finally. But just that hard work has paid off.” Day became the second Australian to win the Match Play title following Geoff Ogilvy, who triumphed in 2006 and 2009. Asked whether he had been at all disappointed with the progress of his career, Day replied: “No, no, no. A career is very long in golf. “You see guys like Adam Scott, Justin Rose winning major championships in their early 30s. You see guys winning in their 20s like Rory and Tiger. “The biggest thing for myself is just to understand I’m not Rory (McIlroy). I’m not Tiger (Woods). I’m not Adam Scott. I’m not Justin Rose,” he added. “I’m Jason Day. And I need to do the work and it will happen, I’ve just got to be patient.” ",2242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-day/hard-work-finally-pays-off-for-day-with-second-pga-tour-win-idUSBREA1N03L20140224
137,ACN,Losing finalist Dubuisson makes big PGA Tour splash,"(Reuters) - Three months after bursting into the limelight with his maiden victory on the European Tour, Victor Dubuisson elevated his profile on the PGA Tour in spectacular fashion Sunday at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. Despite never having played matchplay golf until this week’s elite event in Marana, Arizona, the 23-year-old Frenchman produced several moments of magic, along with a bucketful of birdies, as he stormed through to Sunday’s final. Though bitterly disappointed after losing one down to Australian Jason Day in a marathon title match that lasted 23 holes at Dove Mountain, Dubuisson had much to be proud of after making only his fifth start on the U.S. circuit. “I’m happy but, at the same time, disappointed because this afternoon I didn’t play very well,” the Cannes native told reporters after a birdie by Day at the 23rd hole, the driveable par-four 15th, ended the match. “I just battled, especially the back nine. And at the end, I really battled hard because I wanted to take a chance, at least try to take my chance. “I’ve learned that my nerves, my mental approach, can be very solid in a difficult situation. I’ve learned that anything can happen. I did well this week and I had some good nerve against my opponent. I know what I have to do now to improve.” Dubuisson, who in November won the inaugural Turkish Airlines Open where Tiger Woods and U.S. Open champion Justin Rose were also in the field, conjured two spectacular recovery shots on Sunday that fans watching will never forget. On the 19th hole, the par-four first, he got up and down to save par from desert scrub over the back right of the green, hitting his third shot from behind a cactus, via sand, rocks and a television cable strung in front of him, to four feet. One hole later, at the par-four ninth, he missed the green badly to the left with his approach, his ball ending up in a bush from where he amazingly hit his third to seven feet, prompting a wry smile from Day. “I just play my shot 100 percent, like it was a playable shot, like I have nothing to lose,” Dubuisson said of his strategy. “I battled as hard as I could at the end,” added the Frenchman, a brilliant amateur who turned professional after he missed the cut at the 2010 British Open following his only major start so far. Day was astonished as anyone after watching Dubuisson’s two up-and-downs from seemingly impossible positions. “Vic coming down the stretch was just unbelievable,” the 26-year-old Australian said. “I’ve never seen someone as young, apart from Jordan Spieth, and in the old days, Tiger Woods, how clutch he was, especially out of the cactus. “I kept shaking my head because it was so surprising because there was a couple of times there where I thought he was absolutely dead. The tournament was mine (to win). I’m just so thankful to be here right now,” said the winner.

138,ACN,"Day outlasts Dubuisson, wins thrilling Match Play","(Reuters) - Jason Day fended off a stunning fightback by Frenchman Victor Dubuisson to clinch the biggest title of his career with a one-up victory after 23 holes in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final in Marana, Arizona on Sunday. A commanding three up lead after 12 holes on an afternoon of light breezes at Dove Mountain, Australian Day was caught by the Frenchman, who recorded clutch birdies at the 13th and 17th, followed by an amazing par from a greenside bunker at the 18th. Dubuisson then conjured two miraculous up-and-downs from desert scrub at the 19th and 20th holes to keep the match alive before Day sealed the win by sinking a four-footer for birdie at the 23rd, the driveable par-four 15th. The Frenchman, who had missed the green to the right off the tee, hit a high lob wedge 20 feet past the cup and missed the birdie putt coming back before the Australian made his to secure the title. “I’ve never wanted something so bad in my life,” an emotional Day, 26, told CBS Sports after clinching the winner’s check for $1.53 million. “Obviously I didn’t want it to go this long but Victor, he has a lot of guts and he has got a great short game. He got it straight out of a cactus twice. “The biggest thing was just how much do I want it, how much do I want to win? I kept saying that to myself last night, kept visualizing myself with the trophy. I am just glad that I could finish it off, but it was a close one.” It was Day’s second triumph on the PGA Tour, following the 2010 Byron Nelson Championship, and his first success in one of the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) events which bring together the game’s leading players. Dubuisson, who had never previously played matchplay golf until his WGC debut this week, appeared to be on the way to a heavy defeat after he recorded five bogeys in the first seven holes to reach the turn three down. However, the 23-year-old Frenchman raised his game on the back nine and trimmed the deficit to two with a birdie at the par-five 13th where he was just off the edge of the green in two shots. Both players parred the short 16th before Dubuisson won the par-four 17th with a magical birdie to trail by just one. The Frenchman, who booked his place in the final with a one-up victory over veteran South African Ernie Els earlier on Sunday, had ended up in a fairway bunker off the 17th tee, but struck a stunning approach to 12 feet above the hole. Day, in the right rough off the tee, hit his second shot to 20 feet and narrowly missed his birdie attempt before watching steely-eyed as Dubuisson coolly sank his putt for a three. The Frenchman’s late bid for the title looked decidedly shaky at the par-four 18th when he pulled his approach well left into a greenside bunker. Day, who beat American Rickie Fowler 3&2 in his Sunday semi-final, was on the back fringe of the two-tiered green in two, 70 feet above the hole, from where he ran a very slick first putt 10 feet past the cup. Dubuisson conjured a miraculous shot from the sand for his ball to end up five feet away and the Australian, with the title on the line, left his par putt inches short of the cup. Ice-cool, the Frenchman knocked in his par putt to level the match and force extra holes. Two astonishing moments were produced by Dubuisson before Day finally clinched the title. At the 19th, the par-four first, the Frenchman ended up in desert scrub over the back right of the green with his approach. Day then struck a wedge into the left greenside bunker before Dubuisson, using soft hands, somehow hit his third shot from behind a cactus, through sand, rocks and a television cable strung in front of him, to four feet. After the Australian had splashed out to six feet, he sank the par putt before Dubuisson followed suit to remain all square. One hole later, at the par-four ninth, the Frenchman missed the green badly to the left with his approach, his ball ending up in a bush from where he amazingly hit his third to seven feet, prompting a wry smile from Day. The Australian was on the back fringe in two from where he cozied his approach putt to within two feet of the cup. Dubuisson, non-plussed, duly sank his par putt to keep the match alive. “I know he was the (world’s) number one amateur back in 2009,” said Day about the gutsy Frenchman. “He has got a lot of game and you’re going to see a lot of him for years to come.” ",2242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-matchplay/day-outlasts-dubuisson-wins-thrilling-match-play-idUSBREA1N00G20140224
139,ACN,Swashbuckling Dubuisson aiming to be No 1 - Levet,"LONDON (Reuters) - Swashbuckling young French musketeer Victor Dubuisson has the weapons to win majors and become the world’s number one golfer, according to fellow countryman and former Ryder Cup player Thomas Levet. The 23-year-old Dubuisson lost to Australian Jason Day at the 23rd hole in Sunday’s WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final in Arizona but not before conjuring some Houdini-like escapes from the desert scrub. The Frenchman’s ball was twice buried deep in cactus bushes during the extra holes and each time he chipped and putted to keep the match alive, prompting eight-times major winner Tom Watson to describe them as “two of the greatest up and downs I have ever seen”. “Victor lost in the final but the first thing he said after was that it was a step forward for him,” his friend Levet told Reuters in a telephone interview while practicing in Florida. “His goal isn’t to win that event, he wants to win bigger things. He is a very ambitious guy, he is aiming really high. “Victor’s determination is second to none. He’s very dedicated to the game and he wants to become the best player in the world,” said the 45-year-old Levet who is part of the same management stable as Dubuisson. “He is giving it everything he has and it’s nice to see. He wants to reach the top, he dreams big and he’s not afraid to say it.” The bearded Dubuisson first made the golfing world sit up and take notice by winning the inaugural Turkish Airlines Open in November, eclipsing the likes of world number one Tiger Woods and U.S. Open champion Justin Rose to claim his maiden European Tour title. He has performed consistently well since then and climbed from 30th to 23rd in the rankings after powering his way into last week’s final at the first WGC (World Golf Championship) event of the season. “The good thing about Victor for me is there’s still a lot of room for improvement,” said Levet, who holds the record for the most European Tour wins (six) by a Frenchman. “Imagine what he will be like in a few years time? He will be France’s best-ever player by far. “He has all the weapons to achieve that. He can go a long way if he stays injury free. “You always need a bit of luck to achieve in golf, to win majors for example, but with a bit of luck on his side he can do very big things.” The blond Dubuisson is something of a maverick. He does not practice as much as most of his colleagues and he often prefers his own company but Levet rejected the idea that he was a loner on the circuit. “I’ve known him for maybe eight or 10 years now,” said the 2004 Ryder Cup player. “We have the same manager and he’s a good friend on the tour. “He’s a shy guy, he’s not outspoken, but no, he’s not a loner. It’s just that he gives everything to his golf,” Levet added. “Victor likes to mix with the French guys, go out to dinner with us. But he does have a different diet to the rest of us, he doesn’t eat a lot. “He does his own stuff sometimes and just goes with the feeling he has at the time. Yes, he’s a very different type of guy but, hey, maybe that’s why he’s so successful.” Levet, beaten by Ernie Els in a sudden-death playoff at the 2002 British Open, said there was a touch of the Tiger Woods about Dubuisson. “Funnily enough Victor needs to improve his chipping and he could also hit the ball a lot higher,” said the French veteran. “His distance control and short irons aren’t as good as some other players and his left to right fade is not his favorite shot but he reminds me a lot of Tiger. “Tiger doesn’t practice a lot on the range. When he gets to a tournament he is always ready and Victor is the same. “Victor gave an incredible performance last week but the way he’s been playing the last couple of years I always thought he could do very big things in 2014.” ",2252014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-european-dubuisson/swashbuckling-dubuisson-aiming-to-be-no-1-levet-idUSBREA1O1NV20140225

141,ACN,Garcia and Schwartzel back Final Series changes,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sergio Garcia and Charl Schwartzel, two critics of the inaugural Final Series last year, have backed changes made to the U.S. FedExCup-style event that brings the curtain down on the European Tour season. The bonus pool for the four-tournament Final Series has soared from $3.75 million to $5 million, to be shared by the leading 15 players on the money-list competing at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. The tour has also decided that members will no longer have to participate in two of the first three tournaments in order to qualify for the Dubai showpiece. “I’m very happy to see we have reached a middle ground which should help make us all happy,” Spaniard Garcia said in a news release on Monday. South African Schwartzel said: “I will always try to support the European Tour when I can and it’s great to see that they are also trying to look after us with these new rules.” Former world number two Garcia, 2011 U.S. Masters champion Schwartzel and four-times major winner Ernie Els complained last year that the regulations were unfair. The biggest bone of contention for the players was the tour’s demand that they must compete in two of the first three Final Series events - the BMW Masters and the WGC-HSBC Champions that are both held in Shanghai and the Turkish Open - to qualify for Dubai. “It looks like the Final Series is moving in the right direction, to help the guys come and play in as many of the four events as possible,” said Schwartzel. “By increasing the bonus pool and making it for the top 15, they are all great incentives for us to play.” Last year only the top 10 in the money-list were eligible for the bonus pool. “The inaugural staging of the Final Series was a huge success,” said the tour’s chief operating officer Keith Waters. “However, the European Tour always listens to its membership and we were aware there was some fine tuning required to the overall structure.” Denmark’s Thomas Bjorn, chairman of the players’ Tournament Committee, also welcomed the changes. “The new regulations and the new points system are a good move,” said the 15-times tour winner. “It means if you miss some of those events it will be difficult to win the Race to Dubai (money-list) so there is an incentive to play in as many Final Series events as possible. “The goal for us was to get the top players to play in the Final Series and this will hopefully help do that,” added Bjorn.

142,ACN,Accenture warns consulting business to remain weak,"(Reuters) - Accenture Plc warned that weakness in its consulting business that hurt second-quarter results would carry on though the year, sending its shares down as much as 8 percent. The consulting business, which brings in more than half of the company’s revenue, has fallen in six of the last seven quarters as customers cut discretionary spending and stiff competition puts pressure on contract prices. Accenture raised its full-year profit forecast and the lower end of its revenue forecast. But it said revenue in the consulting business would be flat or grow in the low-single digits in the year ending August 31. The company reported record high consulting bookings of $4.6 billion but Chief Financial Officer David Rowland said on a conference call with analysts that pricing pressure was eating into revenue growth. Consulting revenue fell 1 percent in U.S. dollar terms and payroll costs rose, leading to a lower-than-expected profit for the quarter ended February 28. However, Evercore analyst David Togut said Accenture’s track record of managing costs and the strong bookings numbers bode well for growth in 2015. “Multiple times since its 2001 IPO Accenture has successfully managed cost pressures. Superior bookings growth, high book-to-bill ratios and a strong track record of managing expenses reinforces our conviction in ACN’s earnings growth prospects,” Togut said. Hewlett-Packard Co said in February that revenue from its technology consulting business dropped 4 percent in the quarter ended January but that the business was more profitable. Accenture, recently chosen as the lead contractor for the Obamacare enrollment website, said it expected strong growth in its health and public service business in the second half of the year. The company raised its full-year profit forecast to $4.50 to $4.62 per share from $4.44 to $4.56 per share. It forecast full-year revenue growth of 3-6 percent in local currency, compared with its previous forecast of 2-6 percent. The company’s net income fell 39 percent to $722.3 million in the second quarter. It earned $1.03 per share, slightly lower than analysts average expectation of $1.04, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue, or revenue before reimbursements, rose 1 percent to $7.13 billion. That was in line with the company’s forecast, but fell short of analysts’ expectation of $7.21 billion. Shares of the company were trading down 6.5 percent at $77.59 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They hit a low of $76.25 earlier in the session. The stock has risen almost 10 percent since the company reported first-quarter results, outperforming a rise of about 4 percent in the S&P; 500 index.

145,ACN,Accenture trims profit forecast as margins come under pressure,"(Reuters) - Accenture Plc (ACN.N), a consulting and outsourcing services provider, cut the top end of its full-year earnings forecast as margins come under pressure, taking the shine off a rebound in its consulting business that boosted quarterly revenue. Accenture’s shares, which have been trading around their life-high, fell as much as 3.9 percent in volatile trading on Monday. The company said it expects full-year operating margin at the lower end of its previously forecast range of 14.3-14.5 percent. Analysts have said that Accenture is facing increasing pricing pressure from rivals such as International Business Machines (IBM.N) and others amid sluggish business spending. “I think now you are seeing that lower profitability on some contracts continues to weigh on margins,” Atlantic Equities analyst Christopher Hickey told Reuters. Accenture said it now expects full-year earnings to be in the range of $4.50-$4.54 per share, compared with $4.50-$4.62 earlier. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $4.53 for the full-year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s total operating expenses for the quarter rose 7.5 percent to $7.06 million. Accenture reported a better-than-expected 7.5 percent rise in quarterly net revenue, led by a rebound in demand for its consulting services. Hickey said the company was benefiting from its newer business offerings and several large contracts it had signed earlier. Revenue in the consultancy business rose 5.7 percent in the third quarter compared with a 1 percent decline in the second quarter, highlighting a recovery in the unit that accounts for a little over a half of the company’s total net revenue. Outsourcing revenue rose 9.6 percent, accounting for 48 percent of total net revenue. In the IT outsourcing business, it competes with India’s Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS). Accenture forecast revenue of between $7.45 billion and $7.70 billion for the fourth-quarter. Analysts on average were expecting $7.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “(Accenture) is generally well positioned to capture more than their fair share of discretionary spending and ongoing cost reduction spending,” Hickey added. Gartner Inc (IT.N) forecast in April that it expects worldwide IT spending to total $3.8 trillion in 2014, a 3.2 percent increase from 2013. Accenture’s net income rose to $881.8 million, or $1.26 per share, in the third quarter ended May 31 from $874.1 million, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.21 per share.      Net revenue, or revenue before reimbursements, rose 7.5 percent to $7.74 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $7.55 billion. Accenture’s shares fell to a low of $79.77 but pared some of those losses to trade down 1 percent at $82.13 by mid-day.

146,ACN,"UPDATE 1-Britain sets out shale rules with new oil, gas licensing round","* Licences first step in exploration process * Additional guidance issued on natural beauty spots * Shale development still 5-10 years away-Accenture   (Recasts, adds detail, quote) By Nina Chestney LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - The British government took steps to speed up energy exploration including controversial hydraulic fracturing for shale gas on Monday with a new licensing round for companies looking for onshore oil and gas. Concerns about the potentially dangerous impact of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the search for shale gas has prompted protests in Britain and outright bans on the practice in France and elsewhere. The licences are the first step in the exploration process but do not give outright permission to drill. Oil and gas exploration companies must also obtain planning permission, environmental permits and health and safety approvals before they can receive final go-ahead to drill in Britain. “Ultimately, done right, speeding up shale will mean more jobs and opportunities for people and help ensure long-term economic and energy security for our country,” said Business and Energy Minister Matthew Hancock. Britain is betting on the development of shale gas to help curb its growing dependence on imports and to stem a decline in oil and gas tax receipts as output from the mature North Sea basin dwindles. A third of Britain’s gas needs can come from its own shale gas by the early 2030s if government policies and economic growth allow firms to invest in gas exploration, the National Grid said this month. Britain’s technically recoverable shale gas resources are estimated at around 26 trillion cubic feet and the government has offered tax breaks to drive investment in a sector which has transformed the U.S. energy market. However, Britain is still in the early stages of exploring for shale gas and opposition has grown on grounds that it is potentially harmful to the environment and after one project triggered earth tremors. Fracking involves pumping chemicals, sand and water at high pressure deep underground to release oil and gas trapped in layers of rock. “The more factors that are favourably met in the UK, the sooner it is likely ...although even in the most favourable circumstances, development is at least five to 10 years away,” said Melissa Stark, managing director of Accenture’s new energy business. The government also spelled out steps for companies wanting to drill for unconventional oil and gas such as shale in areas of outstanding natural beauty, national parks and world heritage sites.

148,ACN,"UPDATE 1-Philips, Accenture test brain-controlled system for ALS patients","(Adds Philips’ statement) By Christina  Farr SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The Netherlands’ Royal Philips and IT consultancy Accenture are developing software to help people with neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, live more independently. The companies said they have built a trial application that lets patients with ALS, a disease that diminishes muscle action, issue “brain commands” to turn lights on and off or send an alert to a doctor. The software works by connecting a wireless headset developed by Emotiv, a San Francisco-based startup, to a wearable device. Emotiv says its headset can read brain waves and translate them into readable data, which is then used to issue commands to Philips’ existing connected products such as “smart” TVs and lighting systems. Wearers also can issue commands using their voice or eyes, and the app lets patients store pre-recorded messages in their own voice. Accenture and Philips jointly developed the software that connects the various technologies. It marks the latest in a string of partnerships between information technology and medical firms to develop products for people with chronic conditions. In July, Google struck a deal with Swiss drug maker Novartis to develop a smart contact lens that can monitor blood-sugar levels, which would particularly be useful to diabetics. Accenture and Philips stress their app is a “proof of concept” but said they have tested it with patients. They are open to conversations with other consumer technology providers, like Apple and Google, and are seeking partnerships with caregiver associations. “We are looking for our next set of partners,” Thibaut Sevestre, who heads innovation for Philips’ IT architecture and platforms, said in an interview with Reuters. “Patients find that they can do less and less by themselves, until they are completely paralyzed,” Sevestre added. “So we asked, ‘How can we help them regain control?’” Philips stressed, however, that commercial viability was not yet established. “At this point, we are exploring this concept for the sake of innovation and research. We’ll continue to collect feedback and explore its potential, but we cannot confirm any commercial development at this time, nor any plans to test this on patients in the future,” a Philips spokesman said in a statement. The app is not designed as a monitoring tool that can inform doctors of a patient’s current state. Instead, Sevestre said, it aimed to give people back “some capabilities they’ve lost.” In the later stages of ALS, people will sometimes be rendered completely paralyzed but retain brain functions. The project kicked off in May after several Accenture employees pitched the idea. A key employee died in the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane over eastern Ukraine in July. Throughout the summer, Accenture conducted interviews and tests with ALS patients at its research lab in San Jose, California. Some 400,000 people suffer from the disease, but Accenture’s chief technology officer, Paul Daugherty, said the goal is to adapt the application to a broad spectrum of patients. The firms estimate their app can eventually benefit some 40 million people.

150,ACN,"UPDATE 2-China anti-trust regulator conducts new raids on Microsoft, Accenture","* SAIC broadens raids one week after previous raids * Investigation for suspected anti-monopoly law violations * Suspected violations relate to Windows, Microsoft Office   (Adds comment from Microsoft, Accenture) BEIJING, Aug 6 (Reuters) - A Chinese anti-trust regulator conducted new raids on Microsoft Corp and partner in China Accenture PLC, the agency said on its website on Wednesday, after saying last week Microsoft is under investigation for anti-trust violations. The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) raided offices in Beijing, Liaoning, Fujian and Hubei, it said. The SAIC also raided the Dalian offices of IT consultancy Accenture, to whom Microsoft outsources financial work, according to the regulator. “We’re serious about complying with China’s laws and committed to addressing SAIC’s questions and concerns,” a Beijing-based Microsoft spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement. Accenture also said it is involved in investigations. “We can confirm that, as required by Chinese laws, we are cooperating with investigators of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and are helping provide them with certain information related to one of our clients,” Accenture Greater China said in an e-mailed statement, declining to elaborate. Last week, the SAIC said it was formally investigating Microsoft for breach of anti-trust rules and had raided four of the software firm’s offices in China. Microsoft has been suspected of violating China’s anti-monopoly law since June last year in relation to problems with compatibility, bundling and document authentication for its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office software, the SAIC said last week. The SAIC declined to provide further comment when contacted by phone on Wednesday. Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp was in Beijing to meet with the SAIC on Monday, where the regulator warned Microsoft to not obstruct the probe. But industry experts have questioned how exactly Microsoft is violating anti-trust regulations in China, where the size of its business is negligible. The U.S. company has taken a public beating in China in recent months. It has been subject to wider scrutiny against U.S. technology firms in China in the wake of former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden’s cyber espionage revelations. It has also seen its OneDrive cloud storage service disrupted in China, and had its latest Windows 8 operating system banned from being installed on the central government’s new computers. The Microsoft investigation comes amidst a spate of anti-trust probes against foreign firms in China, including mobile chipset maker Qualcomm Inc and German car maker Daimler AG’s luxury auto unit Mercedes-Benz. China is intensifying efforts to bring companies into compliance with an anti-monopoly law enacted in 2008, having in recent years taken aim at industries as varied as milk powder and jewellery. China on Wednesday said it will punish foreign car makers Audi, owned by Volkswagen, and Fiat SpA’s  Chrysler as well as some 10 Japanese spare-part makers for anti-trust violations. A number of multinational companies including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co and Danone SA have been slapped with substantial fines following similar investigations in the past.

152,ACN,Accenture expects better profitability amid lower costs,"(Reuters) - Consulting and outsourcing company Accenture Plc (ACN.N) said it expects profitability to improve this fiscal year as it focuses on trimming operating costs. Accenture, whose outsourcing business competes with India’s Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS), has faced pricing pressure amid sluggish business spending and stiff competition in the last few quarters. The company said it expects operating margin of 14.4-14.6 percent for the year ending August 2015 — 10-30 basis points higher than the year ended Aug. 31. “(Contract profitability) has been sequentially better in quarter three as compared to quarter two, and then again in quarter four as compared to quarter three,” Chief Financial officer David Rowland said on an earnings call with analysts. “We have seen good progression in payroll efficiency, but yet more work to do,” Rowland added. Accenture forecast full-year profit of $4.74-$4.88 per share, including a 2 percent hit related to currency-rate fluctuations. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $4.91 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company, whose consulting business competes with Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and IBM Corp (IBM.N), also forecast first-quarter revenue of $7.55 billion-$7.80 billion.  Analysts were expecting $7.80 billion. Accenture said it expects $34 billion-$36 billion of new contracts for the full year, compared with $35.88 billion in the previous year. Net income rose to $760.2 million, or $1.08 per share, in the fourth quarter from $727.3 million, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier.  Net revenue increased to $7.78 billion from $7.09 billion, helped by new contracts in both businesses. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.10 per share on revenue of $7.6 billion. Accenture’s shares were hardly changed at $79.59 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

153,ACN,Lawrie to host new match play tournament in Scotland,"LONDON (Reuters) - Former British Open champion Paul Lawrie is to host a new match play event in his native Scotland for the next three years. The 64-man Saltire Energy Paul Lawrie Match Play, carrying a prize fund of one million euros ($1.24 million), will make its debut on the calendar at Murcar Links in Aberdeen from July 30-Aug. 2. “It’s fantastic to be bringing another European Tour event to my home town of Aberdeen,” the 1999 Open champion said in a news release on Friday. “Match play is a format that we don’t get to play too often out on tour so it’s an exciting opportunity for an elite knockout tournament to come to Scotland.” The 45-year-old Lawrie, who has twice represented Europe in the Ryder Cup, has a good match play record. He picked up three and a half points on his Ryder Cup debut in 1999 and also played his part in the ‘Miracle of Medinah’ two years ago, defeating Brandt Snedeker in the singles as Europe produced a dramatic comeback victory. Lawrie also reached the quarter-finals of the WGC-Match Play Championship in 2000 and was third in the Volvo World Match Play two years ago.

155,ACN,Accenture raises full-year revenue forecast after strong first-quarter,"(Reuters) - Consulting and outsourcing company Accenture Plc (ACN.N) raised its revenue forecast for fiscal 2015 after contract wins helped the company post better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenue. The company said it expects revenue growth of 5-8 percent on a local currency basis for the year ending August, up from the 4-7 percent growth it had estimated earlier. Accenture’s shares rose as much as 6 percent to a fresh life-high of $90.99 on Thursday. “I think what you are seeing there is that they had some very big deals last year and those big deals are waterfalling to revenue this year,” Susquehanna analyst James Friedman said. Accenture, however, cut its earnings forecast, citing a larger-than-expected impact from a strong dollar. The company, which gets about 56 percent of its revenue from outside North America, said it expects earnings $4.66-$4.80 per share for the period, down from its previous forecast of $4.74-$4.88. Accenture’s gross margins slipped in the first quarter, which the company said was due to variable costs such as hiring and training. “Despite continued pressure in gross margins ... operating margins expanded 20 basis points on solid management of non-payroll costs,” Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. The company’s quarterly results were mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in its communications, media and technology group and health and public services operation. Revenue in the outsourcing business rose 11.2 percent to $3.80 billion in U.S. dollar terms, accounting for 48 percent of the company’s total net revenue. Accenture’s outsourcing business, which competes with India’s Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS), has faced pricing pressure amid sluggish business spending and stiff competition in the last few quarters. Revenue in Accenture’s consulting business, which competes with Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and IBM Corp (IBM.N), rose 4 percent to $4.09 billion. The business, in which revenue fell in six of the last 10 quarters, started picking up pace in the third-quarter after struggling for a year with low contract profitability, declining discretionary spending and stiff competition. Accenture’s net income including non-controlling interests rose to $882.2 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, in the first quarter ended Nov. 30 from $800.9 million, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier.  Net revenue rose 7.3 percent to $7.90 billion. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.20 per share on revenue of $7.69 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

167,ACN,Fitch Affirms Accenture's IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Accenture  plc (Accenture) and subsidiaries, including Accenture's Long-Term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) at 'A+'/Stable Outlook. Fitch's actions affect approximately $1  billion of debt, including the undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF). A full  list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Negligible Debt: Fitch expects that Accenture's debt will remain negligible over  at least the intermediate term. Solid FCF & Liquidity: Accenture's liquidity is supported by significant and  consistent free cash flow (FCF), despite cyclical demand associated with the  consulting and systems integration (C&SI;) business. Fitch projects FCF (Fitch  defined as post-dividends) will exceed $2 billion annually through at least  fiscal 2018. The company had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Feb.  29, 2016. Cloud-Driven Consulting Growth: Fitch expects increased customer spending on  cloud-related services will continue to drive double-digit consulting growth  over the intermediate term. Consulting represented 53% of revenue during the LTM  ending Feb. 29, 2016 vs 52% for the year-ago period.  Offshore Delivery Capability: The company's significant and diversified offshore  delivery capability, which translates into a strong market position in  attractive long-term growth markets, including applications and business process  outsourcing. Profit Margin Expansion: Recent acquisition activity and attendant integration  expense should constrain profit margin expansion, which Fitch expects will be  modest in FY2016. Talent Acquisition Challenges: High demand and short supply of talent with the  requisite skills in Analytics, Cloud Services, Digital Marketing, and Mobility  will likely drive higher labor acquisition and retention costs. Long-Term Outsourcing Contracts: Fitch believes Accenture's long-term  outsourcing contracts, which account for nearly half of revenues, will drive  meaningful recurring revenues relative to peers. Meaningful Diversification: Accenture has a diversified portfolio of customers,  industries, geographies and service line offerings, supporting Fitch's  expectations for more consistent operating performance than historically. Competitive Environment: Pricing pressures due to intense competition from  multinational, offshore (primarily India-based) and niche IT Services providers. Legacy Services: Fitch expects that long-term software as a service (SaaS)  adoption will suppress demand for traditional systems integration services,  particularly enterprise resource planning software. Fitch believes total IT  services SaaS revenue generation could be less than that from traditional  software implementations over the software's life cycle, despite higher initial  revenue from integrating SaaS into clients' existing systems. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Organic revenue growth of nearly 4% annually; --EBITDA margin increases by 100 basis points annually through FY2018; --Post-dividend FCF exceeds $2.3 billion per year through FY2018; --Most of Accenture's post-dividend FCF will be used for share repurchases and  acquisitions; --Accenture will not engage in significant debt-funded share repurchases or  acquisitions that would signify a shift in the company's financial policies. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may lead to a negative rating action include: --Significant debt-financed acquisitions and/or share repurchases that result in  Fitch's expectations for adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR above 2x for a sustained  period; or --Revenue declines from market share losses resulting in Fitch's expectations  for annual FCF below $1 billion. Positive: Fitch does not anticipate further positive rating actions.  LIQUIDITY As of Feb. 29, 2016, Accenture's liquidity was solid and consisted of: --$3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, almost all of which was available,  given the company's incorporation in Ireland;  --An undrawn $1 billion revolving RCF expiring October 2016. The credit  agreement requires the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio  (debt/EBITDA) of less than 1.75x. Fitch's expectation for more than $2 billion of annual FCF also supports  liquidity. We anticipate Accenture will continue to use FCF for share  repurchases and acquisitions.  As of Feb. 29, 2016, Accenture had negligible outstanding debt, given that the  company's FCF internally funds shareholder returns and acquisitions.  The company does have off-balance-sheet debt in the form of significant  operating lease commitments, since it does not own any of its real estate as  part of its 'asset-light' strategy. Nonetheless, Fitch expects total adjusted  debt to EBITDAR will remain below 1.5x and was 0.8x for the LTM period ended  Feb. 29, 2016. Fitch affirms the following ratings: Accenture --Long-term IDR at 'A+'. Accenture International Capital SCA --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured RCF expiring Dec. 2020 at 'A+'.

172,ACN,Accenture looks to Israel to boost cybersecurity portfolio,"TEL AVIV, June 20 (Reuters) - Seeking to shore up the cybersecurity services it provides to customers, Accenture Plc  has acquired an Israeli company and is establishing a research and development centre in the country. Israeli cyber security firms, many of which have their roots in the military, have attracted growing foreign investment over the past few years, raising a record $540 million in 2015. Accenture, a professional services firm whose competitors include IBM and India’s Infosys, did not disclose financial details of its acquisition of Tel Aviv-based Maglan which provides cyber forensics and simulation servives, malware defence and research on intelligence threats. It employs about 30 people, who “are extremely expert ... from Israel’s military and intelligence complex,” Omar Abbosh, Accenture’s chief strategy officer, told Reuters on the sidelines of a cyber conference at Tel Aviv University on Monday. Abbosh said the company spent about $1 billion acquiring some 20 companies in fiscal 2015 and a similar amount in fiscal 2016, which ends in August. “You can use that to work out a typical deal size,” he said. Maglan will help Accenture tailor services to clients’ needs as the growing variety of cyber attacks today cannot be eliminated with standard off-the-shelf solutions, Abbosh said. Maglan’s clients include financial services, telecom and automotive companies. Accenture’s new R&D; centre will focus on industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and active defence, which uses artificial intelligence and advanced analytics to see an anomaly before an attack has happened. “They are working on research we expect to apply within a three-year time frame,” he said. Accenture is also collaborating with Team8, an Israeli firm that creates cybersecurity companies. In February, Accenture, which is incorporated in Ireland, participated in a $23 million funding round for Team8.

173,ACN,Accenture revenue beats on strong demand for digital services,"(Reuters) - Accenture Plc posted better-than-expected quarterly net revenue, driven by demand for its digital services like cloud and security, particularly in its consulting unit. However, shares of the company fell 1.26 percent to $117.49 in early trading after it forecast mid-range for its fourth-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ average estimate. Accenture, incorporated in Ireland, said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of between $8.25 billion and $8.50 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $8.39 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. To cope with competition, the company has been investing heavily in its digital business, as more enterprise clients shift to technologies like analytics, cloud and security services. “We are even now considering the next play...I’m thinking about artificial intelligence,” Chief Executive Pierre Nanterme said on a conference call. The company, whose competitors include, IBM Corp, India’s Infosys Ltd, acquired analytics consulting company OPS Rules and Israel’s Maglan to boost its cyber security portfolio in the third quarter. “They are using higher revenue growth to invest in different parts of the business to sustain their model going forward...so the lower margin profile this year seems more discretionary than a sign of fundamental weakness,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst David Grossman said. The company, which offers consulting and outsourcing services, said it expects full year net revenue growth to be in the range of 9.5 percent to 10.5 percent in local currency, up from previous estimate of 8-10 percent.

Shares of the company were up 5.4 percent on Thursday and was the biggest boost on the S&P; 500. They touched a record high of $124.96 earlier in the session. Increasing demand for digital services from businesses has forced IT service providers to beef up their security, cloud and analytics services. Accenture said it would continue with its push to the services which it refers to as “The New”. “We will continue to invest in high-growth areas ... with a particular focus on digital, cloud and security services,” Chief Executive Pierre Nanterme said in a statement.  In fiscal year 2016, the company invested more than $930 million in acquisitions, 70 percent of which in “The New”. The company spent about $800 million on acquisitions last year. Accenture said in September it would buy three companies: DayNine, a partner of human resources software provider Workday Inc WDAY.N, Octo Technology, a technology consultancy firm based in France, and Kurt Salmon, a unit of Management Consulting Group Plc (NZX.L). Accenture is relying on digital services to gain market share from rivals including IBM Corp (IBM.N) and India’s Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS.NS).  Revenue from Accenture’s “The New”, which includes digital, cloud and security-related services, accounted for 40 percent of total revenue in fiscal year 2016, up from about 30 percent in the previous year.  “I think what differentiates Accenture from its competitors is...they were very early to make digital investments... and (that) is now bearing fruit,” Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher said.

193,ACN,"Google rebrands cloud business, adds more artificial intelligence","(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Thursday it renamed its business-to-business cloud computing brand and enhanced some enterprise applications using artificial intelligence, the company’s latest gambit to better compete with Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp. in the lucrative cloud business.   Discussing the rebranded Google Cloud, Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google’s enterprise business, said the company has made good progress courting customers and improving its technology.  Cloud computing uses remote internet servers to store, manage and process data, and Google offers a range of apps like word processing and email, as well as the ability to host data and offer resources for developers. The new name replaces the Google for Work brand.  “We are closing the gap incredibly fast” with competitors, Greene, a former CEO of VMware who joined Google last year to ramp up its cloud business, told experts and journalists at an event.  Analysts say Google trails Amazon and Microsoft in market share but is gaining under Greene. Although the business is not big enough to break out separately in its quarterly earnings statement, Google reported a 33 percent surge in “other revenue” in its most recent quarter, which analysts said was probably due largely to gains in cloud computing.   Greene has moved quickly to streamline engineering and appointed new leadership to beef up the company’s cloud business. This has helped improve sales, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company’s latest earnings call. Earlier this month, Google acquired cloud software company Apigee Corp in a deal valued at about $625 million. The company on Thursday also announced a partnership with consultant Accenture to develop cloud services for clients in industries such a retail, healthcare and finance. In addition, the company said it had woven more artificial intelligence into its apps to help employees work more efficiently. Using machine learning to crunch troves of data, Google says its apps will prompt users to, say, open files at certain times of day or propose meetings based on their habits. Google recently added a U.S. data center in Oregon in order to speed up service and next year will open more in Virginia, Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, São Paulo, London, Finland and Frankfurt.

204,ACN,"Microsoft, Qualcomm back Israel's Team8 cybersecurity firm","TEL AVIV (Reuters) - The venture arms of Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) have invested in Team8, an Israeli creator of cybersecurity start-ups, as big multinational companies get behind Israel’s burgeoning cyber industry in the face of growing threats. Team8, which also announced on Monday a strategic partnership with Citi (C.N) to help develop its products, said the most recent investment brings its total raised to more than $92 million. Its other investors are Cisco, AT&T;, Accenture, Nokia, Singapore’s Temasek, Japan’s Mitsui, Bessemer Venture Partners, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors and Marker LLC. While the number of attempted cyber attacks was 20,000 a week two or three years ago, that figure had now risen to 600,000-700,000, said Yoram Yaacovi, general manger of Microsoft Israel’s development center.  Israel has some 450 cyber start-ups, which receive 20 percent of global investment in the sector. Although the need for security is growing quickly, the proliferation of start-ups means that several companies compete in every subsector. “A large part of companies created won’t get to the finish line,” Nadav Zafrir, Team8 chief executive and former commander of the Israeli army’s technology and intelligence unit 8200, told a news conference.  He said he believes Team8’s strong partners and its plan to build a portfolio of different technologies gives it an edge. Team8 confirmed that Microsoft had been an investor since last June.  “The expectation of our investors is to build independent companies that will lead their sectors,” he said. Israel has a well established high tech industry, using skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors. Tax breaks and government funding have encouraged start-ups, and also drawn in entrepreneurs from abroad. Launched in 2014, Team8 employs 180 people in Israel, the United States, Britain and Singapore and plans to hire 100 more workers in 2017. Two companies it created are Illusive Networks, which uses deception technology to detect attacks and has been installed at banks and retailers, and Claroty, which secures critical infrastructure sites such as oil and gas fields. Details of two more companies it has set up will be announced this year, Zafrir said.

210,ACN,Accenture beefs up blockchain security,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Accenture Plc has developed new technology that it says can help make blockchain applications more secure and could speed up their deployment in sectors such as finance. The professional services firm on Wednesday unveiled a system that makes it easier for blockchain users to store their security credentials in hardware security modules (HSM), or highly secure  processors that are specifically designed to safeguard passwords and “digital keys.” Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering crypto-currency bitcoin, is a shared  record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet, instead of a centralized authority. Banks and other large financial institutions have been ramping up their investments in blockchain in hopes that it can help simplify cumbersome processes such as securities settlement and international payments. “It (Accenture’s new technology) is a significant development but it is also not a development that is going to be visible at the front-end of things,” said Martha Bennett, a principle analyst working with chief information officers for research house Forrester. “It is one of those absolutely essential pieces in the puzzle that makes an end-to-end blockchain deployment actually work.”       Deployment of the nascent technology by financial institutions has been in part slowed down by concerns over security.  Information on a blockchain can only be accessed and edited by users that possess cryptographic keys, which have traditionally been stored in “cyberwallets.” As these have been previously hacked and their contents stolen, “cyberwallets” are deemed not sufficiently secure by financial institutions, which are used to storing their digital keys in HSMs, Accenture said. Coding blockchain applications to work with HSMs has proven complex and time-consuming. Accenture’s platform makes it possible for banks to store digital keys automatically for their blockchain applications in HSMs.  It currently works with HSMs from security company Thales and blockchain applications using code developed by the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger group. But the company plans to extend use to all types of blockchain protocols and HSMs.  Accenture’s technology comes as more financial institutions seek to take some of the blockchain prototypes they have tested over the past year into the real world.  At the same time, some have expressed concern that blockchain’s potential may be over-hyped and that it will take several years before the technology will yield benefits for large companies.

Fintech investment in China more than tripled to $10 billion from 55 deals last year, representing 90 percent of fintech ventures in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan also saw a large spike with fintech ventures totalling $154 million from 14 deals in 2016, more than double the previous year’s $65 million, said Accenture, whose analysis was based on data from CB Insights. Fintech ventures typically leverage technology, such as cloud data storage or smartphones, to provide cheap and easy-to-access services from loans and insurance to payment services and crowdfunding. Investment in Chinese fintech ventures was buoyed by blockbuster deals such as a $4.5 billion fundraising round at Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. China’s second-largest e-commerce company JD.com Inc also raised $1 billion for a consumer finance subsidiary, Accenture said. “Many of China’s financial services companies are making investments in fintech companies and exploring cutting-edge solutions such as blockchain technology,” said Albert Chan, Accenture’s managing director of financial services in China. In Japan, the spike in fintech ventures was good news for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who sees the industry as key to breathing new life into the country’s long-stagnant economy. Strict regulation, scant access to funding and weak demand for innovative financial services from a risk-averse population had previously made Japan barren ground for fintech ventures. Japan made legal changes last year to attract more fintech ventures, including easing curbs on bank investment in non-financial firms. The country also became one of the first to regulate virtual currency exchanges at a national level, a move seen as boosting investors’ trust after the high-profile collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange in 2014. Bitcoin exchanges bitFlyer and Quoine ranked second and third respectively by size of investment in Japanese fintech ventures last year, the data showed.

220,ACN,"Accenture's full-year profit forecast disappoints, shares fall","(Reuters) - Consulting and outsourcing services provider Accenture Plc (ACN.N) slightly raised its full-year profit forecast, but the revised outlook was still largely below market expectations, sending the company’s shares down as much as 4.5 percent. Accenture has invested heavily in its fast-growing businesses, such as digital and cloud services, amid stiff competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O) and IBM Corp (IBM.N). Revenue in its consulting unit, which has a higher profit margin than its outsourcing business, increased 2.6 percent in the second quarter ended Feb. 28, the slowest growth in more than a year. “The consulting business tends to provide a higher profit profile and so if you’ve got greater contribution from areas like outsourcing, it is more difficult for the company to continue to raise margins over time,” said Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher. Accenture plans to spend about $1.5 billion on acquisitions in the year ending August, Chief Financial Officer David Rowland said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Up to Wednesday’s close, the company’s shares had risen 8 percent this year and hit record levels earlier this week, as investors awaited the quarterly report. “High investor optimism was met with just ho-hum results. I do not think it is more than that. It is a natural pause,” Kreher said. Accenture said it expects adjusted profit of $5.70 to $5.87 per share for its year ending August, slightly higher than its prior forecast of $5.64 to $5.87 per share. However, the company narrowed its full-year revenue forecast growth range to 6 percent to 8 percent in local currency, from its previous 5 percent-8 percent range. The new forecast points to revenue of between $34.86 billion to $35.51 billion. Analysts on average are expecting a profit of $5.87 per share and revenue of $34.60 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Accenture said second-quarter net revenue rose 4.7 percent to $8.32 billion, as it benefited from strong demand for its digital, cloud and security-related services, which made up more than 45 percent of revenue. Net income attributable to Accenture fell to $838.8 million or $1.33 per share in the quarter, from $1.33 billion, or $2.08 per share, a year earlier. Profit in the year-ago quarter benefited from a $553.6 million gain on the sale of some businesses.  The company’s profit in the second quarter was hurt in part by a higher tax rate and increased operating costs, up 4.3 percent to $7.62 billion.

224,ACN,AI to become main way banks interact with customers within three years: Accenture,"LONDON (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence (AI) will become the primary way banks interact with their customers within the next three years, according to three quarters of bankers surveyed by consultancy Accenture (ACN.N) in a new report.  Four in five bankers believe AI will “revolutionise” the way in which banks gather information as well as how they interact with their clients, said the Accenture Banking Technology Vision 2017 report, which surveyed more than 600 top bankers and also consulted tech industry experts and academics.   Artificial intelligence — the technology behind driverless cars, drones and voice-recognition software — is seen by the financial world as a key technology which, along with other “fintech” innovations such as blockchain, will change the face of banking in the coming years.     More than three quarters of respondents to the survey believed that AI would enable more simple user interfaces, which would help banks create a more human-like customer experience. “The big paradox here is that people think technology will lead to banking becoming more and more automated and less and less personalized, but what we’ve seen coming through here is the view that technology will actually help banking become a lot more personalized,” said Alan McIntyre, head of the Accenture’s banking practice and co-author of the report.  “(It) will give people the impression that the bank knows them a lot better, and in many ways it will take banking back to the feeling that people had when there were more human interactions.”  The top reason for using AI for user interfaces, cited by 60 percent of the bankers surveyed, was “to gain data analysis and insights”.  But worries over the privacy of data were cited as the top challenge, with one in three also saying that the fact users often prefer human interactions could also be a problem.  The report also found that, while the number of human interactions in bank branches or over the phone was falling and would continue to do so, the quality and importance of human contact would increase.  “What you’re going to get on the bankers’ side is access to far better information, and that’s going to allow them to understand what your needs are and what the advice is that they need to give you,” said McIntyre.  Banks’ advisory arms are an area considered one of the ripest for technological innovation.  “The advisory business of banking is a very costly model, and artificial intelligence can help to manage the data and to scale the advisory model in a way that was unforeseeable before,” said Roberto Mancone, Deutsche Bank’s global head of disruptive technologies and solutions.

229,ACN,Exchange operator TMX develops proxy voting prototype using blockchain,"TORONTO, April 6 (Reuters) - The Toronto Stock Exchange operator, TMX Group Ltd, said on Thursday it has developed a blockchain-based prototype for electronic shareholder voting, the latest effort by an exchange operator to leverage the technology to try to solve an industry problem. The secure electronic voting prototype, which was developed in consultation with Accenture Plc, would make voting during annual shareholder meetings significantly more efficient and accurate, and help boost shareholder involvement in corporate governance without the need to vote in person, said TMX. Thousands of clients could potentially benefit from the technology, according to TMX, including more than 3,000 issuers listed on its exchanges, more than 200 sell-side broker/dealers and a handful of depositories. “This (industry problem) is something that’s been plaguing us for quite some time,” John Lee, vice president of TMX’s Innovation and Enterprise Delivery, said in an interview. “The technology to try and address this problem wasn’t really something we could use until you looked at something like blockchain.” Distributed ledger technology (DLT), more commonly known as blockchain and popularly associated with the virtual currency bitcoin, is a decentralized, distributed record of data or transactions. The database characteristics and immutable nature of the technology make information transparent and easy to track, and large-scale hacking extremely difficult. Banks and other large financial institutions have been ramping up efforts to develop practical applications using blockchain. Proponents say it will help make some of their most burdensome back-office processes, such as the clearing and settlement of securities, simpler, cheaper and more transparent. Nasdaq Inc, one of the world’s largest providers of technology for exchanges and clearing houses, uses blockchain to power its U.S. market for shares of private companies and has been testing it to run proxy voting for companies listed on its exchange in Estonia. Lee said another prototype in partnership with certain members of the Liquidity Alliance is also nearing completion. Alliance members include Deutsche Borse and Clearstream. That blockchain project addresses how a business can operate in a multi-jurisdictional environment. TMX’s new proxy voting system prototype still needs regulatory approval before it can be tested live, the company said. “There’s always constant dialogue taking place. As you can imagine, the TMX group is a heavily governed organization,” Lee said, noting that talks would involve a number of federal and provincial regulators.

The companies unveiled a prototype of the network on Monday at the UN headquarters in New York during the second summit of ID2020, a public-private consortium promoting the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goal of providing legal identity for everyone on the planet. The project aims to help individuals such as refugees prove who they are in order to gain access to basic services such as education and healthcare. Blockchain, first developed as a public ledger of all transactions in the digital currency bitcoin, is increasingly being used to securely track data in other fields. “Without an identity you can’t access education, financial services, healthcare, you name it. You are disenfranchised and marginalized from society,” David Treat, a managing director in Accenture’s financial services practice, said in an interview.  “Having a digital identity is a basic human right.” The new platform will connect existing record-keeping systems of commercial and public entities through blockchain, allowing users to access to their personal information wherever they are. For example, refugees who have fled their country leaving behind birth or education paper certificates would still be able to provide proof of those credentials through the system.  One of the main advantages of blockchain is that it allows systems of different organizations to communicate with each other, Yorke Rhodes, global business strategist at Microsoft, said in an interview. The prototype was built on top of an existing Accenture platform, which powers the biometric identity management system used by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  Accenture and Microsoft, which worked on the prototype with managed service provider Avanade Inc, are inviting other companies to join their project. PricewaterhouseCoopers and Cisco Systems Inc are among the organizations involved in ID2020.  “What ID2020 is truly focused on is bringing together an alliance of stakeholders to ensure the technology that is being developed is responsive to the needs of individuals,” Dakota Gruener, executive director at ID2020, said in an interview.  “Technology is only one piece of this.”  ",6192017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-accenture-digitalid/accenture-microsoft-team-up-on-blockchain-based-digital-id-network-idUSKBN19A22B

242,ACN,Accenture trims revenue forecast amid US healthcare uncertainty,"(Reuters) - Accenture Plc (ACN.N) trimmed its annual revenue forecast on Thursday, triggering concerns that uncertainty around U.S. healthcare policy may be weighing on the company’s flagship consulting business. Shares of the Dublin-domiciled company, which also provides outsourcing services, were down 4.7 percent at $121.17 in morning trading. The stock earlier fell to its lowest level in nearly two months. Accenture, which gets 17.5 percent of its revenue from healthcare and public service clients, said its North American business was hurt by slower-than-expected spending by these customers due to uncertainty around U.S. healthcare legislation. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to replace Obamacare, and Republican leaders unveiled a draft healthcare bill on Thursday. Accenture said it now expects net revenue to rise 6 percent to 7 percent for the year ending August, compared with an earlier forecast for a 6 percent to 8 percent increase. “The lower revenue guidance highlights concerns that their legacy consulting business is deteriorating,” Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said, adding that the business was slowing at a faster rate than Accenture’s shift to digital, cloud and security services. Accenture’s revenue forecast overshadowed a better-than-expected net revenue for the third quarter ended May 31. Revenue rose 5.1 percent to $8.87 billion in the quarter, as the company benefited from investments to boost its digital and cloud services. Analysts on average had expected $8.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Accenture, like other IT services providers, has beefed up its security, cloud and analytics services to meet burgeoning demand from businesses for digital services. The company has invested heavily on acquisitions to boost these services, which now make up about half its total revenue. Accenture expects to spend about $1.8 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. Accenture also raised its forecast for full-year profit, citing a lower-than-anticipated impact from a strong dollar. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share of $5.84 to $5.91, compared with a prior forecast of $5.70 to $5.87. Net income attributable to Accenture fell to $669.5 million or $1.05 per share in the third quarter, from $897.2 million or $1.41 per share, a year earlier. The company took a pre-tax pension settlement charge of $510 million in the quarter related to the termination of its U.S. pension plan. Excluding one-time items, Accenture earned $1.52 per share, in line with analysts’ expectations. Including Thursday’s losses, Accenture’s shares are up 3.4 percent so far this year.

Accenture helps large companies write new software and adopt new technology. The company will create special teams dedicated to helping its customers, which include banks and retailers, write iOS apps. Apple employees, including software engineers and user-interface designers, will work alongside Accenture engineers on the teams. The first joint team will be located in San Francisco, Gene Reznik, senior managing director of technology and ecosystem at Accenture told Reuters. The companies did not say how many combined Apple-Accenture teams will eventually exist. But the engineering teams will focus on apps that are used by front-line workers and consumers, such as apps that run on iPads for the lobbies of retail banks, where a teller and a customer might both interact with the app. “If you look at something like retail banking, you can imagine really redesigning the apps and coming up with a unique perspective on how agents can interact with their customers,” Reznik said. Reznik said another focus will be so-called augmented reality, in which digital objects float over real objects on a screen. That technology could be useful to service technicians in the field, for example by pointing an iPhone or iPad at an engine and highlighting a faulty part that needs repair.  For Apple, the partnership is part of a continued push to win over business clients and try to knock Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) from its long-held throne as the default operating system in the corporate world. To that end, Apple has established partnerships with International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), Deloitte and SAP SE (SAPG.DE) aimed at moving more business applications over to iOS devices and making them easier to use in corporate settings.

259,ACN,Accenture sees 'secular downward' trend in bank fees,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Bank’s services fees face “secular downward” pressure in the long run, which will drive lenders back toward credit transactions whose margins are resilient to competition and new technologies, a senior executive at management consultants Accenture Plc (ACN.N) said. Banks have relied in recent years on sales of insurance, credit/debit cards, asset management and other products as a way to offset narrowing margins on lending-related activities and higher capital requirements. Return on equity in those so-called fee segments can be three or four times bigger than in lending. But Alan McIntyre, senior managing director for global banking at Accenture’s consulting arm, said services such as investment advisory or payment processing are some of the ripest for innovation. Technology helps financial start-ups gain customers at the expense of traditional banks, which face “fee margin compression because of compressive disruption,” he said. Traditional lenders, as a result, will end up relying more on lending spreads, McIntyre told Reuters in an interview, given that “they will not easily undergo compression, due to their complexity in many cases.” His remarks underscore how technology could make banking far more personalized and reliant on relationships than many think. Artificial intelligence will be the main channel through which banks will interact with their customers by the end of the decade, McIntyre’s group said in a report earlier this year. McIntyre, in Brazil over the past week to visit customers, said so-called “Big Tech” is wary of entering the territory of banks due to fear of central bank regulations. Digital customer experience is not really enough to steal many customers away from traditional banking relationships, he said, noting that customers are moving on to digital ones at a single-digit pace in many markets. “The existing threat is Big Tech intermediating bank customers and leaving banks as utilities who provide products but don’t manage the customer relationship,” McIntyre said. He added that Brazilian banks have a “false sense of security” in their profitability, noting that domestic and global peers alike must think more seriously about efficiency to remain attractive to investors.

Accenture’s quarterly revenue beat estimates and their forecast for growth in fiscal 2018 was in line with analysts’ expectations, leaving the company’s shares broadly flat. Chief Executive Pierre Nanterme said on an earnings call that the outsourcing service provider had been seeing prolonged weakness in the North American market on lower client spending due to uncertainty surrounding proposals by Republicans to replace the Affordable Care Act.    Anticipation of certain reforms were creating “wait-and-see positioning” from their clients, he said. The company forecast net revenue growth for the fiscal year 2018 to be in the range of 5 to 8 percent. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $37.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, reflecting a near 7 percent growth rate from a year earlier. The company’s revenue from what it calls “the New” – digital, cloud and security-related services - grew about 30 percent to $18 billion for the year ended August 31 and accounted for about 50 percent of its total revenue. In the past three years, the company has deployed about $3.4 billion in roughly 70 acquisitions, spending $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2017 alone, much of it on digital and cloud-related businesses. “Over the next 2-3 years, Accenture should generate mid-high single digit constant currency revenue gains driven by sustainable, double-digit gains from “the New”,” Evercore ISI analyst David Togut wrote in a client note.

Blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions, leaped to prominence as the technology that underpins the first digital currency, bitcoin. It has since attracted global attention because it can be used to track, record and transfer assets across all industries. The project aims to improve how central banks and financial institutions deal with the settlement of payments, Accenture said in a statement. It focuses on specific real-time gross settlement features and a liquidity-saving mechanism on a decentralized system without compromising privacy.  The project is the second phase of an industry-wide initiative called Project Ubin, led by MAS and ABS, a group of financial institutions that includes Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), DBS Bank Ltd (DBSM_pc.SI), HSBC (HSBA.L), JPMorgan (JPM.N), Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T), OCBC Bank (OCBC.SI), Singapore Exchange (SGXL.SI), Standard Chartered Bank (STAN.L), and United Overseas Bank (UOBH.SI). “This helps to open up opportunity for a wider adoption of DLT-based settlement systems,” said Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer at MAS in a statement. DLT refers to distributed ledger technology, otherwise known as blockchain. “We are sharing our learnings and knowledge from Project Ubin to encourage greater experimentation amongst central banks and financial institutions. We look forward to working with other central banks on the use of DLT for cross-border applications,” he added. For the project, Accenture is using the Accenture Liquid Studio in Singapore, a research lab that focuses on emerging technology experimentation and rapid application development to develop and test interbank payment models using three blockchain platforms: Quorum, R3 Corda, and Hyperledger Fabric.  ",10122017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-accenture-blockchain-singapore/singapore-central-bank-bank-association-accenture-in-blockchain-tie-up-idUSKBN1CH2ZJ

It focuses on specific real-time gross settlement features and a liquidity-saving mechanism on a decentralized system without compromising privacy.  The project is the second phase of an industry-wide initiative called Project Ubin, led by MAS and ABS, a group of financial institutions that includes Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), DBS Bank Ltd (DBSM_pc.SI), HSBC (HSBA.L), JPMorgan (JPM.N), Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T), OCBC Bank (OCBC.SI), Singapore Exchange (SGXL.SI), Standard Chartered Bank (STAN.L), and United Overseas Bank (UOBH.SI). “This helps to open up opportunity for a wider adoption of DLT-based settlement systems,” said Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer at MAS in a statement. DLT refers to distributed ledger technology, otherwise known as blockchain. “We are sharing our learnings and knowledge from Project Ubin to encourage greater experimentation amongst central banks and financial institutions. We look forward to working with other central banks on the use of DLT for cross-border applications,” he added. For the project, Accenture is using the Accenture Liquid Studio in Singapore, a research lab that focuses on emerging technology experimentation and rapid application development to develop and test interbank payment models using three blockchain platforms: Quorum, R3 Corda, and Hyperledger Fabric.  ",10122017,http://www.reuters.com/article/accenture-blockchain-singapore/singapore-central-bank-bank-association-accenture-in-blockchain-tie-up-idUSL2N1MN1SV

285,ACN,"Accenture's digital push boosts earnings, shares hit record","(Reuters) - Consulting and outsourcing services firm Accenture Plc’s (ACN.N) quarterly earnings and revenue topped Wall Street forecasts, as investments in fast-growing digital and cloud services paid off. Shares of Accenture, which have risen about 30 percent this year, rose 4 percent to a record high of $157.93 in on Thursday morning. The company also lifted its forecast for yearly earnings per share and gave a forecast for current-quarter revenue largely ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue from Accenture’s digital, cloud, analytics and security-related services - a group it calls “the New” - made up 55 percent of overall revenue in the first quarter ended Nov. 30. “The primary driver of our growth in the quarter continues to be the New,” Accenture Chief Financial Officer David Rowland said on a call with analysts. Indeed, much of Accenture’s recent growth has been driven by digital and cloud services, which include everything from managing clients’ social media marketing strategies to helping them move operations to the cloud. Another bright spot for Accenture was revenue from the healthcare and public services industry, which rose nearly 9 percent and exceeded growth in prior quarters. The result came despite warnings from the company of weak client spending amid uncertainty around U.S. healthcare law. “Based on the results of last quarter, businesses were feeling more confident and the spending clearly improved since last quarter,” Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. Accenture has also grown rapidly by buying smaller companies and has invested some $3.4 billion on about 70 acquisitions over the past three years. About half of that amount was spent in fiscal year 2017 alone as Accenture ramped up digital and cloud investments, helping it gain market share from Cognizant (CTSH.O) and IBM Corp (IBM.N). The company expects to spend another $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion on acquisitions in fiscal year 2018. The Dublin-based company expects an annual tax rate of 22 to 24 percent, down from a prior expectation of 23 to 25 percent. The forecast does not include the impact of an expected overhaul of the U.S. tax code, which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Net income attributable to Accenture rose 11.8 percent to $1.12 billion. On a per-share basis, earnings were $1.79, ahead of analysts’ average forecast of $1.67 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue rose nearly 12 percent to $9.52 billion, topping analysts’ expectations of $9.26 billion.

297,ACN,Accenture trims profit margin forecast as spending grows; stock dives,"(Reuters) - Consulting services firm Accenture Plc (ACN.N) trimmed its yearly forecast for profit margins, driving its stock down 6 percent on Thursday and overshadowing quarterly results that comfortably topped Wall Street targets. Accenture now expects fiscal 2018 operating margin — profit as a proportion of revenue — of 14.8 percent, a level consistent with results in fiscal 2017, but lower than the 10- to 30-basis-point expansion originally expected by the company. Dublin-based Accenture flagged lower profits from services for healthcare and public service clients as well as higher spending as reasons for the revised forecast. The company also said it expects operating margin to expand in the second half of the year. “Operating margin was light of (Wall Street) expectations ... operating profit in the Health & Public Service sector has declined significantly,” Atlantic Equities analyst Chris Hickey said. Accenture has spent more than $3 billion over the last three years — nearly half of it in fiscal 2017 — on some 70 acquisitions, to boost its digital and cloud services in order to compete better with Cognizant (CTSH.O) and IBM (IBM.N). Those services helped Accenture grow net revenue by 15.2 percent to $9.59 billion in the second quarter ended Feb. 28, the biggest increase in at least five years. Net revenue also soared past analysts’ average expectation of $9.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The digital and cloud services, which Accenture calls “the New,” also made up more than 55 percent of revenue, reaching a record level. “‘The New’ is really impacting across the board,” Chief Executive Pierre Nanterme said on a call with analysts. Accenture began investing in businesses such as digital marketing and cybersecurity about five years ago, compared with its peers that began a similar effort only one or two years back, said Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Khatri. The company forecast current-quarter revenue between $9.90 billion and $10.15 billion, well ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $9.68 billion. Net income attributable to the company rose to $863.7 million in the second quarter, from $838.8 million a year earlier. Accenture reported earnings of $1.37 per share in the latest quarter. Results included a $137 million charge related to the new U.S. tax code. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.58 per share, topping market estimates of $1.49 per share.
