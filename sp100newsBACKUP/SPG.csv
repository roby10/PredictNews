3,SPG,"US mall vacancies rise in 2nd quarter, rents flat"," * U.S. regional mall vacancies jump to 9.3 pct, rent flat   * Strip mall vacancies climb to 11 pct, rent flat   * Reis economist not optimistic picture will change soon   By Ilaina Jonas   NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - The average vacancy rate for large U.S. shopping malls reached its highest level in 11 years in the second quarter, as department store closings took effect and retailers scaled back their floor space due to cautious shoppers, according to a report issued on Friday.   Preliminary figures by real estate research firm Reis show the vacancy rate at these regional malls rose to 9.3 percent, the highest level since 1990 and up from 9.1 percent in the first quarter.   The picture was even bleaker for U.S. strip malls where retailers gave up over half million more square feet than they rented. The vacancy rate at these local retail strips was 11 percent versus 10.9 percent in the first quarter, almost matching the 11.1 percent record set 20 years ago, Reis said.   Rents at both types of retail locations were flat.   “Even though we’ve been out of a recession for two years, there aren’t a lot of jobs out there, and people are still risk adverse,” said Ryan Severino, Reis senior economist. “That’s depressing demand for both retail goods and retail space.”   In addition to weak demand from consumers, landlords are grappling with competition from online sales, which reduces demand for physical stores.   “Halfway through 2011, it is difficult to feel optimistic about retail properties. Expect continued difficulties for the retail sector in the latter half of 2011,” Severino said.   At regional malls, anchor stores that closed prompted some specialty tenants to leave when their leases were up. In other cases, closed anchor stores allowed specialty store tenants to break their leases.   That put pressure on rents. The average U.S. regional mall asking rent in the second quarter was essentially flat compared with the first quarter, at $38.77 per square foot, and about the same as in 2006.   Asking rent at strip malls during the second quarter was also about flat at $19.03 per square foot.   Strip malls are quicker and cheaper to build but have left the strip mall sector struggling with too much inventory.   Factoring in months of free rent and other incentives landlords use to lure tenants, effective rent was $16.54 per square foot at strip malls, the lowest level since the third quarter of 2005.   (For graphics of retail mall vacancies and rent, click: r.reuters.com/nar52s and r.reuters.com/war52s )   U.S. retailers reported better-than-expected June sales on Thursday. The 25 chains tracked in the Thomson Reuters sales tally reported a 6.5 percent gain in sales at stores open at least a year. [ID:nN1E76602K]   “On a relative basis, retail sales have done OK,” Severino said. “But there was a pretty big pullback in the wake of the recession, and we haven’t really gotten back to the spending levels that we once saw.”   Even if demand from retailers begins to rise, it will take a while before space is leased and vacancies tighten enough for landlords to raise rents and reduce incentives.   Big mall owners such as Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N), General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N) and Taubman Centers Inc (TCO.N), as well as strip mall owners Kimco Realty Corp (KIM.N) and Equity One Inc EQY.N are scheduled to report second-quarter results in the next few weeks.

4,SPG,COMPANY VIEW-Executives on U.S. debt ceiling talks," NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The impasse over the U.S. debt limit left President Barack Obama’s Democrats and their Republican rivals further apart than ever on Tuesday, as Wall Street braced for a looming U.S. default and credit downgrade.   Here are comments from company executives over the past week on what they think about the debt talks:   SCOTT DAVIS, CEO, UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC (UPS.N)   The world’s largest package delivery company gave a cautious economic outlook and cited stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks.   “If Congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily in the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly,” Davis told analysts on a conference call.   Without a debt resolution or free-trade agreements, the company’s business customers are keeping inventory thin and expansion plans on hold, UPS said.   SANDY CUTLER, CEO, EATON CORP (ETN.N)   “These compromises never seem to come together until the 24th hour. It looks like that’s how this one is going to play out. I think they will find some common ground at the very last moment and pull a rabbit out of the hat.”   DAVID SIMON, CEO, SIMON PROPERTY GROUP (SPG.N)   “I’m known for checking our accounts receivable every month when I get the report. And they (the U.S. government) are always 30 days delinquent.   “But beyond that, we don’t see any real risk. Spreads will invariably widen for all of corporate America and for all asset classes. So we’ll be a participant in that, but beyond that, we can’t see anything that’s going to be anything material.”   “We’ve kind of aired our dirty laundry in the international press and that’s not good for the U.S. markets, it’s not good for U.S. business.”   JIM HAGEMANN SNABE, CO-CEO, SAP AG (SAPG.DE)   “We strongly believe that businesses and countries need stability on the financial side. We hope the U.S. will sort its financial situation out.”   Snabe said there was nothing the company can do to prepare for a possible default.   THOMAS FALK, CEO, KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP (KMB.N)   “I was in Europe recently, and we were having a debate with some of our European team over which region of the world had the bigger problem: is it the Europe sovereign debt crisis or the U.S. structural budget deficits and debt ceiling?   “It’s just disappointing that the two biggest economies in the Western world can’t seem to get their fiscal house in order.”   DAVE ANDERSON, CFO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC (HON.N)   Anderson said the stalemate in Washington and concerns over corporate tax reform and European sovereign debt were among the principal factors affecting business sentiment.   “Despite the fact that we’re in a market upturn right now in the industrial economy, we try to hold fixed costs relatively flat. We don’t want to get out ahead of our headlights in terms of any over-hiring.”   CLAY JONES, CEO, ROCKWELL COLLINS INC (COL.N)   “I’m not sure how one prepares for a default since we’ve never had one in the history of our country. There is no playbook that I know of that suggests here’s what one should do, either as a company or a private citizen, when the country starts going out of business.”   KEITH SHERIN, CFO, GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (GE.N)   The largest U.S. conglomerate has boosted its cash holdings and cut its long-term debt in the past three years.   “The main thing that we’ve done, and it’s not specifically for the discussion going on in the U.S. about raising the debt ceiling or the European issue, is we just have dramatically increased our liquidity.”   YOUNG SOHN, CEO OF CHIPMAKER INPHI (IPHI.N)   “If interest rates change and people lose their confidence in a stable currency, the macroeconomic headwind will increase and that means people will be confused and maybe panic.   “We have to be very careful here.

5,SPG,"Simon Property beats on profit, raises forecast","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) quarterly earnings rose nearly 20 percent, boosted by higher occupancy, rent and sales at its malls and outlet centers, and the company raised its forecast for the year.  Chief Executive and Chairman David Simon said on Tuesday he expects the board to approve a “meaningful” dividend increase in the fourth quarter, and that it might raise the dividend again in 2012.  Most Americans are spending cautiously after the financial crisis, though the richest have been buying with vigor. That means retailers have focused on locating their stores in malls that generate the most revenue and bring in the most shoppers — something that has proven good for Simon.  “One of the things that we have heard from our department store and big-box clients that are the retailers is that 2008 through 2009 taught them that who their landlord is matters,” Richard Sokolov, Simon’s president and chief operating officer, said in a conference call with analysts.  Simon owns well known venues such as the Galleria in Houston, Roosevelt Field on New York’s Long Island, the Forum Shoppes in Las Vegas, and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, New York. It is the largest owner of U.S. malls and outlet centers and the largest U.S. real estate investment trust.  “At first glance, it’s hard to find anything not to like about Simon’s earnings this quarter,” said Richard Imperiale, president of Uniplan Investment Counsel Inc, which has $1 billion under management and owns Simon shares.  During the second quarter, sales at stores in Simon shopping centers rose 9.4 percent to $513 per square foot. Simon owns or has an interest in 392 retail properties, making it the largest U.S. owner of malls and outlet centers.  Its top 20 malls generated $770 per square foot at the end of June and its top 20 outlet and value centers generated sales of $721 per square foot.  That kind of sales performance helped push up occupancy to 93.5 percent from 93.1 percent a year earlier. New leases called for rents that were 9.1 percent higher than those that had expired.  For the second quarter, Simon reported funds from operations — a performance measure for real estate investment trusts — of $583 million, or $1.65 per share, up from $487.7 million, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting $1.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  FFO removes the profit-reducing effect depreciation has on earnings, as well as the profit from property sales.  Indianapolis-based Simon also raised its FFO forecast for the year to $6.65 to $6.73 per share, from a previously boosted range of $6.55 to $6.65 per share. Analyst had forecast $6.73 per share.  “The consumer actually, I feel a little bit better about,” David Simon said.  Still, there are some retailers that are still struggling and could close stores or file for bankruptcy, he said.  The company’s properties that it has owned for at least a year generated operating cash flow, known as net operating income, of 3.5 percent, compared with the 1 percent to 2 percent that Imperiale expects the sector to see.  Simon is undertaking a $1.5 billion program — $650 million this year and $800 million next year — renovating 18 U.S. centers and building outlet centers in North America and Asia. At the end of the quarter, the company had access to $4.1 billion in cash and still expects to generate $1 billion in cash after dividend payments.  To satisfy the U.S. government’s requirement of a REIT to pay out at least 90 percent of its taxable income, Simon’s board is likely to approve a big dividend increase by the end of the year and raise its annual dividend, now $3.20 per share, for at least three quarters of 2012.  Simon’s shares rose $2.02, or 1.7 percent, to $122.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.

7,SPG,COMPANY VIEW-Executives on U.S. debt ceiling talks," NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats rushed to rework rival deficit reduction plans on Wednesday, but with the fate of both proposals in doubt, top lawmakers pursued a behind-the-scenes compromise to avert a crippling U.S. debt default. [ID:nN1E76P2HJ]   Here are comments from company executives over the past week on what they think about the debt talks:   ROBERT GREIFELD, CEO, NASDAQ OMX GROUP (NDAQ.O)   “We’re not going to have a default. I’m confident that our political leaders will come to a pragmatic solution. I’m confident they’ll get there,” Greifeld told Reuters in an interview.   Separately, on a conference call with analysts, he said, “On a macroeconomic basis it’s not hard to say that we need greater certainty out of Washington. It’s not helpful for investor confidence in terms of what we see transpiring here.”   GREG SWIENTON, CEO, RYDER SYSTEM INC (R.N)   Swienton said the company is not undergoing any current tactical changes because of the overhanging debt ceiling tumult.   “As an American I worry about it a great deal. As the CEO of Ryder, you worry that that might have an impact on the economic environment.   “I hope we get some sanity in Washington. I hope they figure it all out for everyone’s benefit and we’ll all be much better off.”   ROBERT MOORE, CFO, LPL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC (LPLA.O)   “The debt ceiling issue is a major overhang for us at the moment, and how that ultimately is resolved is unclear at this point, and it’s equally unclear as to what the real consequences of the outcome from that debate will be under a variety of scenarios.”   JOSEPH ZUBRETSKY, CFO, AETNA (AET.N)   “We have a team of people who are monitoring the debt ceiling situation closely. We do not believe that a failure to raise the debt ceiling would result in any short-term impact to our claims-paying ability.   “We have adequate liquidity to meet all potential funding commitments and the business should perform just fine.   “Longer-term, not addressing this situation is really just untenable for the nation. It needs to be addressed so there’s more certainty in the environment.”   WES BUSH, CEO, NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP (NOC.N)   “Continued uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling and future defense budget caused our customers to move more slowly and spend more conservatively.”   MIKE JACKSON, CEO, AUTONATION (AN.N)   “If there is an extended stalemate here on the debt ceiling and the government shuts down step by step, that will have a meaningful impact on the economy and definitely affect the pace of this recovery.   “Assuming there’s an orderly resolution to the debt situation, I see a very strong close to the year.”   EMERSON ELECTRIC CO (EMR.N):   “U.S. and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft-patch and it remains unclear if they will improve much in the second half of the calendar year.   “Industrial-related businesses are still strong, but we expect them eventually to soften due to the generally poor economic environment (the negative budget discourse in Washington, D.C., and ongoing European debt crisis) and weakening trends.”   SCOTT DAVIS, CEO, UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC (UPS.N)   The world’s largest package delivery company gave a cautious economic outlook and cited stalled U.S. debt ceiling talks.   “If Congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily in the next week, the mood of the country could change pretty quickly,” Davis told analysts on a conference call.

8,SPG,Company View: Executives on debt ceiling talks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deadlock between Republicans and Democrats over how best to reduce the deficit, and over what period, has blocked an agreement to allow the raising of the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.  A Republican deficit reduction plan headed to a close vote in Congress on Thursday and the White House urged lawmakers to compromise.  Here are comments from company executives on what they think about the debt talks:  “What’s going on in Washington concerns me more than anything going on in our business. We need courageous people in Washington, and my biggest fear is they’re not there.”  McCausland said he favors a plan from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner.  “I hope the Boehner plan is voted on by the Congress and passes. I think it’s the best plan out there.  “We can’t default. I don’t think we will. But we also can’t borrow 40 cents out of every dollar we spend.”  “The uncertainty itself does create a lot of questions and a lot of fear down value chains. We continue to work through groups like The Business Roundtable to urge Washington to resolve these matters in an expedient way.”  “Frankly, I’m a bit embarrassed to be a U.S. citizen, and part of me is wondering whether our democratic process is ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of these types of problems.  “If we did this as businessmen running companies, we’d be fired.  “It definitely has the potential to impact the average consumer, who may be nervous about the economic outlook long term and conserve spending.”  “We’re not going to have a default. I’m confident that our political leaders will come to a pragmatic solution. I’m confident they’ll get there.”  The company is not undergoing tactical changes because of the overhanging debt ceiling tumult, Swienton said.  “As an American, I worry about it a great deal.

9,SPG,COMPANY VIEW-Executives on U.S. debt ceiling talks," NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - Deadlock between Republicans and Democrats over how best to reduce the U.S. deficit, and over what period, has blocked an agreement to allow the raising of the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.

11,SPG,Unknown risk and values batter real estate shares,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The commercial real estate sector is taking a beating as investors find risk and values difficult to determine because of global economic worries.  Friday night’s downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt by Standard & Poor’s sent the financial markets into yet another round of turmoil, battering publicly traded real estate companies, mostly real estate investment trusts.  Since last year, REITs had been leading the rebound in commercial real estate because they have been able to raise cash via equity markets and the corporate bond market, unlike their much bigger private market counterparts. This allowed REITs to bulk up their balance sheets and buy property.  On Monday, investors fled to the safety of cash and U.S. Treasuries, sending the S&P 500 .SPX down 6.66 percent.  U.S. REITs fared even worse, down 9 percent.  “I think all buyers of commercial real estate are ratcheting down their expectations for future rent and occupancy growth based on all the recent dour economic news. That has to negatively impact values,” Jim Sullivan, managing director at Green Street Advisors, an independent REIT research firm.  REITs that are still working out their balance sheet problems from the last recession were crushed. Shares of mall owner General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N) on Monday fell 14.9 percent, to close at $11.75, well under the $15 per share price its major backers were given when it emerged from bankruptcy in November. Its shares have fallen 30 percent so far this month.  Shares of shopping center and mall owner Developers Diversified Realty Corp (DDR.N) fell 12.3 percent on Monday to close at $10.80. The shares have lost a quarter of their value since the start of August.  Fear has gripped even investors in some of the strongest and best capitalized REITS. Shares of Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N), the largest U.S. REIT, fell 8.4 percent on Monday and are down 17 percent for the month. Office building owner Boston Properties Inc (BXP.N) lost 8 percent of its value on Monday and is off 17 percent for the month.  The apartment sector, one of the first commercial real estate sectors to bounce back, also was hurt, as the prospect for raising rents dims in light of an economic slowdown. AvalonBay Communities Inc (AVB.N) lost 4 percent on Monday and Equity Residential (EQR.N) shares fell 6.67 percent.  Although most U.S. commercial real estate rents and occupancy rates have not recovered from the last recession, REIT stock prices last year outperformed the overall market. In the public and much larger private markets, prices for buildings in the most restrictive and expensive areas of Manhattan, Washington D.C. and San Francisco have rebounded significantly.  But overall, U.S. commercial real estate prices are still more than 45 percent below their peaks in 2007.  Monday’s cratering capped off a week of reckoning by investors who may have ignored the high level of risk that still haunts investment.  “At the end of the day, the implication of the downgrade on U.S. debt is that global risk has been underpriced,” said Pamela Hannigan, associate clinical professor of real estate at New York University’s Schack Institute of Real Estate.  Risk plays a big part in commercial real estate investments because of the slow process of buying and selling big buildings. That risk is usually reflected in the interest rate lenders charge and the yield buyers expect on their property investments.  Commercial real estate transactions are financed by with at least 50 percent debt — usually much more —making cost of debt critical in prices offered.  The repricing of risk is likely to result in higher borrowing costs, which would bring down property prices.  A slowdown now in the U.S. economy could lead to higher interest rates for borrowers, as risk is factored into probability of being repaid.  A second recession could translate into less demand for hotel rooms, office and warehouse space and retail space at malls and shopping centers.  “No one knows what any of this means,” said Rick Lechtman, managing director at Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group LLC.  In the longer term, the risk epiphany that has wrecked so many markets may favor both REITs and private real estate.  “What’s a real asset that investors can turn to when they want to be conservative, keep their principal and earn some income?” Hannigan said. “Well, that turns us to real estate.”  ",8082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uscommercialproperty/unknown-risk-and-values-batter-real-estate-shares-idUSTRE7776K320110808

13,SPG,"UPDATE 4-Simon profit tops view; forecast, dividend raised","* Q3 FFO $1.71/share vs Wall Street view $1.66 * Tenant sales up 9.3 pct per square foot * Net operating income up 3.8 pct * Company raises dividend 12.5 percent * Shares down 0.7 pct By Ilaina Jonas Oct 25 (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc , the largest owner of U.S. malls and outlet centers, reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings as its tenants’ sales rose, lifting lease payments, and the company raised its dividend and full-year profit forecast. For the third quarter, Simon reported a 20 percent rise in funds from operations, a performance measure for real estate investment trusts. “I’m going to give them credit for doing a good job of managing their portfolio of properties, in the sense of culling underperforming properties and focusing on getting better results from existing properties,” said Richard Imperiale, president of Uniplan Investment Counsel Inc. He said Simon’s performance was boosted by higher-than-expected sales per square foot and lower-than-expected expenses. During the quarter, sales at stores in Simon shopping centers rose 9.3 percent to $517 per square foot. Simon owns or has an interest in 391 retail properties. The strong sales are likely to allow Simon to push up rents. In the quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis, new leases called for rents that were 9.6 percent higher than those that expired. Amid the weak U.S. economy, the wealthy have bolstered sales at luxury malls, while value stores and outlet centers have attracted shoppers seeking bargains. Simon has both high-end malls and outlet centers, and has been able to attract both types of shoppers, Imperiale said. “I think as long as the economy continues to at least have some GDP growth, we will be able to continue to attract the better customer that I think has disposable income to spend,” said David Simon, the company’s chairman and CEO. Recently, Gap Inc , Simon’s largest tenant, said it would shutter about 20 percent of its stores over the next two years. Simon has 240 non-outlet Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores in its malls. David Simon said the Gap closures could benefit his company. Gap overall pays below-market rents and lags in generating sales. Simon said it already has been approached by other retailers interested in spaces vacated by Gap. “There’s no question you will have a step backward and two steps forward,” David Simon said. “At the end of the day, we just think there’s tremendous upside overall.” Third-quarter FFO totaled $606.2 million, or $1.71 per share, up from $503.6 million or $1.43 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $1.66 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. FFO removes the profit-reducing effect depreciation has on earnings, as well as profit from property sales. Net operating income, which reflects the cash the properties generate minus expenses before financing, rose 3.8 percent at properties the company has operated at least a year. Simon ended the quarter with $930 million in cash and access to $4 billion in its credit facility. The company is spending $500 million this year to redevelop properties; it said that could grow to $1 billion next year. The redevelopments include adding hotels, apartments and office buildings to existing malls, such as Copley Place in Boston. Simon plans to expand its outlet business in Asia, South America and Europe. It said it is willing to look at acquisitions but will not revisit buying Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc . Britain’s largest mall owner last year rebuffed a takeover offer from Simon. Indianapolis-based Simon raised its quarterly dividend by 12.5 percent to 90 cents per share. It also issued a special stock dividend of 20 percent in order to conform with REIT guidelines to distribute at least 90 percent of taxable operating profit to shareholders. The company raised its full-year FFO forecast to a range of $6.80 to $6.85 per share. Its previous forecast was $6.65 to $6.73. Analysts expect $6.81. Despite the strong results, Simon shares were off 0.7 percent to $121.96 in afternoon trading in a broadly lower market. The benchmark MSCI U.S. REIT Index was down 1.1 percent.",10252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/simonproperty/update-4-simon-profit-tops-view-forecast-dividend-raised-idUSN1E79O04L20111025
14,SPG,BNP reaps 1.5 billion euro gain on Klepierre,"PARIS/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA), France’s biggest listed bank, said on Thursday it would sell more than half its stake in real-estate firm Klepierre SA (LOIM.PA) to Simon Property Group (SPG.N), reaping a 1.5 billion euro ($2 billion) capital gain. The deal takes BNP a step closer to meeting tougher capital requirements under new banking regulations, intended to crack down on risk-taking, that have forced many European banks to slash their balance sheets and sell assets to beef up capital. It also gives Simon, the largest U.S. owner of malls and outlet centers, a brood footprint in European retail real estate. The deal will see Simon become Klepierre’s largest shareholder with a 28.7 percent stake. BNP still holds 22.2 percent in the real estate company and there is speculation that a full exit of Klepierre is in the cards. “Although Simon Property says it does not currently intend to increase its stake (in Klepierre), it seems to us that in the medium-term this is the direction we’re going in,” Natixis analyst Serge Demirdjian said. BNP shares closed up 3.7 percent at 37.00 euros. The bank’s stock has gained 21.9 percent so far this year, outperforming a 15.9 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 index .SX7P. BNP is targeting a 9 percent core Tier 1 capital ratio under the new “Basel III” regulations for January 1, 2013. The Klepierre deal lifts its ratio by 0.32 percentage point and reduces risk-weighted assets by around 25 billion euros, BNP said. BNP is targeting a further 3 billion-euro cut in risk-weighted assets at its investment portfolio, which includes a stake in insurer Axa SA (AXAF.PA) and private equity assets. The deal also marks the second time in as many weeks that BNP has sold assets to a U.S. buyer. Last month BNP sold a $9.5 billion portfolio of energy loans to American bank Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), a sign of how European banks’ drive to reduce U.S. dollar funding is offering opportunities to rivals Stateside. The property sector is seen as being particularly ripe for mergers and takeovers, not just because banks are putting assets on the block, but because sluggish economic growth in Europe is pushing property companies to expand via acquisition. “There’s not much in the way of rental growth, capital growth, and so companies are looking at means of expanding elsewhere,” Investec analyst Alan Carter said. Simon is paying 28 euros per Klepierre share, or a premium of 19.7 percent from Wednesday’s closing price. Analysts said that was higher than expected. Klepierre rose 8.4 percent to 25.35 euros on Thursday. “The price of 28 euros is above expectations for between 24 to 26 euros,” Natixis’ Demirdjian said. Simon Property Chief Executive David Simon will become the chairman of Klepierre’s nine-member supervisory board under the terms of the deal. Two other Simon representatives will also join. That will give Simon a fair amount of influence over the company’s future, Green Street Advisors analyst Cedrik Lachance said. Simon was able to acquire the stake at a slight discount to net asset value, he added. In 2010, Simon had $1 billion in assets in Europe but has since sold both of what had been its major holdings there, the most recent sale involving its 49 percent interest in Gallerie Commerciali Italia in the first quarter. The stake in Europe’s second-largest retail real estate owner with assets in 13 countries plus a development team, would mark Simon’s return to the continent. “It’s an attractive deal from the standpoint of price and the elements and the influence that Simon now gained on the company,” Lachance said. Simon Property will receive Klepierre’s dividend to be declared in April. The Indianapolis, Indiana-based company has also agreed to acquire a stake in 26 assets of Mills LP belonging to its joint venture partner, Farallon Capital Management, for $1.5 billion. In connection with both deals, Simon said it plans to sell 7 million shares and granted underwriters and option for up to 1.05 million more shares to cover any overallotment. It also said it would issue three new series of senior unsecured notes with a total principal amount of $1.5 billion. The stock issuance helped send shares of Simon down 1.6 percent to trade at $136.00 in afternoon dealings on the New York Stock Exchange. With many of Europe’s property companies trading at significant discounts to net asset value, analysts said other cash-rich overseas companies like Westfield Group WDC.AX were possibly eyeing takeovers or the option to snap up stakes. The sector, particularly shopping mall operators, faces dismal rental and growth prospects as recession and the impact of Internet shopping have hit property values and tenant demand. “We have been arguing that mergers and acquisitions (in real estate) will come this year, or will be intensifying,” said JPMorgan Cazenove analyst Harm Meijer. “I don’t rule out Simon doing something else as well, given their track record and underrepresentation in certain markets like the UK.” Simon Property unsuccessfully attempted to acquire British mall owner Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc CSCG.L, in which it presently owns a 4 percent stake, early last year. “Do I think that it’s feasible that within the next 5 or 10 years ... that Simon or Westfield end up owning one or two or three of Europe’s, including the UK’s, largest companies? Yes, I think that’s feasible,” Investec’s Carter said. Simon Property revised its full-year outlook and now expects 2012 funds from operations per share to be between $7.35 and $7.50, up from a previous forecast of $7.20 to $7.30. Lazard, JPMorgan Securities LLC and Goldman Sachs & Co are serving as financial advisers to Simon on the Klepierre transaction.

Simon Property, the largest owner of U.S. malls and outlet centers, will receive Klepierre’s dividend to be declared in April 2012. The Indianapolis, Indiana-based company has also agreed to acquire its joint venture partner, Farallon Capital Management LLC’s stake in 26 assets of the Mills Ltd Partnership for $1.5 billion. Simon Property revised its full-year outlook and now expects 2012 funds from operations to be between $7.35 to $7.50 per share, up from $7.20 to $7.30 per share.

20,SPG,Simon Property earnings blows past estimates,"(Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) raised its full-year forecast after posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Friday, thanks in part to higher occupancy and rent at its outlet centers and malls. “It was a blowout quarter,” said Richard Imperiale, president of Uniplan Investment Counsel Inc. “It’s no one or two things that really drove it. It was just solid improvement across most of the numbers.” The results sent Simon shares up 1.7 percent in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The gap between good U.S. malls - in dense, high income or vacation destinations - and the not-so good - which struggle to lure shoppers - has widened since the recession. Retailers have been fleeing the weaker malls and lining up to get into the more productive ones. Simon Property is the largest owner of U.S. malls and owner and developer of outlet centers which have done phenomenally well. During the quarter, sales at its U.S. core portfolio jumped 11.2 percent and occupancy and rent rose. The stronger the sales, the more power a landlord has when it comes to negotiating rent. Landlords also share in a part of the increased sales at its tenant stores. Indianapolis-based Simon said first-quarter funds from operations were $648.7 million, or $1.82 per share, compared with $570.6 million, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 9.7 percent to $1.12 billion. The company again raised its quarterly dividend, this time to $1.00 per share from 95 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected funds from operations of $1.68 a share, on revenue of $1.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Funds from operations, or FFO, is a real estate investment trust performance measure that usually excludes gains or losses from property sales and removes the effect depreciation has on earnings. Simon again raised its forecast range for FFO for the year to $7.50 - $7.60 per share, from $7.20 - $7.30 per share. Analysts are expecting $7.48 per share. The company’s forecasts are conservative, and Simon more often than not raises them each quarter. Occupancy at its core U.S. portfolio in the first quarter rose to 93.6 percent, up 0.60 percentage points. Tenant sales were an $546 per square foot on a trailing 12-month basis. Average rent per square foot was up 4.4 percent to $39.87 per square foot. Net operating income, a closely watched measure indicating how well the properties are managed, rose 5.7 percent at properties the company has operated at least a year. Simon, the world’s largest real estate company and the only one in the S&P; 100, owns or has an interest in 337 retail real estate properties in North America and Asia. Its portfolio includes some of the most popular malls in the United States, including Roosevelt Field Mall in New York; King of Prussia Mall in Pennsylvania; The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace Las Vegas; Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta, and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York. It also is at the forefront of global expansion, with outlet malls either in or planned for China, Brazil, Malaysia, Canada and Europe. During the quarter, Simon also agreed to take a 28.7 stake in Klepierre, Europe’s second-largest retail real estate owner.

24,SPG,Simon Property shareholders oppose CEO pay plan,"May 21 (Reuters) - Shareholders of Simon Property Group Inc , the largest owner of U.S. malls and outlet centers, overwhelmingly voted against the company’s executive compensation plan that included one million shares for its CEO David Simon. An e-mailed response from the company, however, suggested that it may not change the CEO’s compensation package despite shareholder disapproval. “Our board firmly believes it was and is critical to retain Mr. Simon as the company’s CEO through a long-term, equity-based retention agreement that further aligns his interests with our stockholders,” Simon Property said in an e-mail to Reuters. At the company’s 2012 annual meeting held on May 17, 186.1 million shareholders voted against the company’s proposed executive payouts, while 67.7 million shareholders voted for it, Simon Property said in a filing with U.S. regulators on Monday. The votes are, however, non-binding. “We value our stockholders’ input and our Compensation Committee will take their views into consideration as it reviews compensation plans for our management team,” the company said in the e-mail. Simon Property agreed to give the CEO 1 million in long-term-incentive-performance (LTIP) units for him to remain with the company for at least another eight years, a regulatory filing showed last year. The LTIPs, which are like shares once they are earned and vested, were supposed to be doled out in three stages beginning in year six. The retention award takes Simon’s 2011 total compensation package to $137.2 million f rom $24.6 million in 2010. Simon Property was valued at $1.5 billion when Simon became CEO in 1995. As of May 21, the market value of the Indianapolis-based company was about $43.75 billion.",5212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/simonproperty/simon-property-shareholders-oppose-ceo-pay-plan-idUSL3E8GL0SE20120521
25,SPG,"Penney raises cash, unveils new shops","NEW YORK (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) said it raised $248 million by selling part of its stake in a Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) unit, the first step toward its goal of shedding non-core assets. Shares of the retailer, which also unveiled on Monday the first three of its new in-store shops, were up 1 percent in afternoon trade. Penney has been revamping stores, merchandise and strategy under new Chief Executive Ron Johnson, who previously ran the retail division at Apple Inc (AAPL.O). Johnson is trying to ignite Penney’s sales and profits by transforming the mid-tier department store into a hip place to shop. He got rid of profit-sapping discounts that came to be a Penney hallmark and is carving the stores into dozens of in-store shops and boutiques dedicated to a particular brand or theme. “Johnson has a real vision of how he intends to remake Penney, to make it a much cooler place to shop,” said Gilford Securities analyst Bernard Sosnick. “There’s much to be said if he can accomplish that goal, but having 20 new departments will take time. In the meanwhile, sales are sliding.” On Monday, Penney unveiled the first three of its new departments, displaying a focus on jeans timed to coincide with the late summer back-to-school season, the second-most important time of year for retailers. Starting on August 1, 683 Penney stores across the country will have in-store shops dedicated to the Levi’s and Arizona brands, as well as a new brand called “i jeans by Buffalo.” At the men’s Levi shops, shoppers can sit at a “denim bar,” talk to iPad-toting “fit specialists” and choose from 11 different cuts and 88 different finishes or washes. At the women’s Levi’s stores, consumers can shop by body type, using their “curve ID,” said Ben Fay, executive vice president of real estate, store design and development. That means women can identify themselves as having “slight curves,” “demi curves,” or “bold curves,” Fay, who worked with Johnson at Apple, said. Other in-store shops slated to open on September 1 include JCP men’s and women’s wear, Izod and Liz Claiborne. Johnson started assembling a “dream team” last year to execute the turnaround for the 110-year-old company. But last month, a key member of the team, Michael Francis, left his position as president, after a new advertising campaign flopped. Penney said in May that same-store sales during the first three months of its new pricing model fell a far worse-than-expected 18.9 percent. It also posted a large net loss and cut its dividend. While the current store changes only affect a portion of J.C. Penney’s stores, the company expects to have in-store shops in all of its stores by 2015, said Fay. He declined to provide details regarding the exact breakdown of capital expenditures between Penney and the vendors it partners with on the shops, though he did say that in some cases, vendors were contributing. J.C. Penney spokesman Joey Thomas said the stake sale announced on Monday was “not because J.C. Penney needs cash”. “Simon Property Group is trading high, so market conditions were favorable for us to monetize a portion of our holdings,” Thomas said in an email. Penney said it exchanged 2 million units of ownership in Simon’s subsidiary for $248 million, or $124 per unit — a discount to Simon’s current stock price. Simon Property shares closed at $156.97 on Friday. “To me, it says that maybe their cash position was getting low and that maybe they needed an infusion,” said Gilford’s Sosnick. Following the transaction, JCP Realty Inc, a unit of the department store chain, continues to hold about 205,000 limited partnership units in Simon’s operating partnership. Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levinson said it was possible that Penney could sell its remaining shares to raise cash as well.

28,SPG,"Simon Property posts higher profit, raises forecast","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) reported an 18 percent increase in a key earnings measure on higher rents and sales at its malls and outlet centers, easily beating estimates, and the real estate investment trust raised its outlook and dividend. Simon is one of the first mall companies to report second-quarter results amid a weak U.S. retail environment, with sales under pressure from stubbornly high unemployment, slow job growth and wary consumers. “Going into the earnings, the malls were a little bit weak because of declining sales,” said Jeung Hyun, Adelante Capital Management portfolio manager. “You started seeing weak retail sales numbers and investors extrapolated from that and started to sell the malls. I think this report at least assuages some of the fears about fundamentals.” It is the second time this year that Simon has raised its guidance, and its fourth dividend increase in as many quarters. Simon said second-quarter funds from operations (FFO) rose to $688.8 million, or $1.89 per share, from $583.0 million, or $1.65 per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 14 percent to $1.19 billion. Analysts, on average, expected $1.81 a share on revenue of $1.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. FFO is a REIT performance measure that usually excludes gains or losses from property sales and removes the effect that depreciation has on earnings. Simon raised its FFO forecast for the year to a range of $7.60 to $7.70 per share from a previous $7.50 to $7.60. The company’s forecasts tend to be conservative, and Simon often raises them each quarter. Analysts expect $7.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The primary factors contributing to this (forecast) are strong operational performance and the impact of our recent investment activity,” David Simon, chairman and chief executive officer, told analysts during a conference call. The company, based in Indianapolis, raised its quarterly dividend to $1.05 per share from $1.00. Simon shares rose 1 percent, or $1.59, to $157.56 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Taubman Centers Inc (TCO.N), which owns luxury malls, also rose, while another REIT, General Growth Properties (GGP.N), was off 0.5 percent. During the second quarter, sales at Simon’s tenants’ stores at U.S. core portfolio malls and outlet centers rose 9.9 percent to $554 per square foot, compared with a rise of 11.2 percent in the first quarter. Stronger sales attract tenants and eventually lead to higher rents. Also, landlords take a share of tenants’ sales. Second-quarter net operating income growth slowed to 5.1 percent from 5.7 percent in the first quarter. Still, during the quarter, new leases called for rents that were 10 percent higher than those that expired, Simon said. Simon, the only real estate company in the Standard & Poor’s 100 index, owns or has an interest in 336 retail real estate properties in North America and Asia. Its portfolio includes some of the most popular U.S. malls, including Roosevelt Field Mall and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York; The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace Las Vegas; and Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta. Simon has international outlet centers in Malaysia, Canada, Japan, Korea and Europe. It is redeveloping or expanding 25 U.S. properties and two in Japan. Earlier this week, the company hired Matthew Lentz, former managing director and portfolio manager at PointState Capital, to be its first chief investment officer. Lentz will have plenty to work with as the company has access to $6.5 billion in cash under its existing $4.0 billion revolving line of credit and its new multicurrency revolver that can be expanded to $2.5 billion.

Klepierre, whose key shareholders are U.S.-based Simon Property Group and French bank BNP Paribas, said it expected rental income to grow 3 to 4 percent this year instead of its  previous target of circa 4 percent. “This is due to the accelerated disposal programme,” Chief Executive Laurent Morel told a conference call. The company will still hit its targets on a like-for-like basis; it also reiterated expectations of a slight increase in net current cash flow per share for 2012. Against the backdrop of a stagnating European economy, Klepierre posted six-month rental revenue growth of 4 percent at its shopping malls, with rising tenant sales at France, Scandinavia and Central Europe offsetting declines in trouble-spot countries like Italy and Spain. Similar trends were seen at larger rival Unibail-Rodamco , which is focusing on big malls that perform whatever the economic weather. Klepierre is selling assets to cut debt and said it had sold or agreed to sell slightly more assets than expected in the first half, at 520 million euros ($628.42 million). CE O Mo rel told journalists that there were currently no plans to raise the overall target of 1 billion euros in sales by 2013. Net current cash flow per share for the first six months of 2012 was flat at 0.99 euros compared to the same period in 2011 after dividend payout. Asked whether there were any plans for Simon Property Group to increase its 28.7 percent stake in Klepierre, which it bought earlier this year from BNP Paribas, Morel would only say that there was a standstill agreement until March 201 3. BNP holds 22.2 percent of Klepierre and there is speculation that it will one day fully exit the subsidiary. At a separate event, Simon Property Group’s David Simon, who has been appointed head of Klepierre’s supervisory board, said that there had been plenty of benefits already from Simon’s investment - cheaper cost of debt, meetings with brands like Apple - but that nothing had been decided. “We’re going to get $55 million added cash flow while we decide whether we love this company,” Simon s aid at a c onference call with analysts. “Who knows what we do with this investment.” Simon is the largest U.S. owner of malls and outlet centers .

31,SPG,"Simon Property second quarter earnings jumps, raises forecast","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) reported second-quarter funds from operations jumped more than 18 percent, on greater rents and sales at its malls and outlet centers, easily beating estimates, and raised its outlook and dividend. For more than a year, Simon, the largest U.S. owner of malls and outlet centers, has consistently posted increased growth in tenant sales and comparative net operating income, but gains slowed in the second quarter. Still, rents posted their highest increase in five quarters. “This is the second time this year that the company’s raised guidance, the fourth quarter in a row that they’ve raised the dividend, and in the past 34 quarters, this is the 32nd time they’ve either met or beat estimates. I think that’s pretty telling in of itself,” Sandler O’Neill and Partners analyst Alexander Goldfarb said. The stock rose 1.3 percent in early trading. Shares of Simon as well as the entire sector have outperformed the S&P; 500 index. Simon said second-quarter funds from operations (FFO) rose to $688.8 million, or $1.89 per share, from $583.0 million, or $1.65 per share, a year earlier. Revenue gained 14 percent to $1.19 billion. Analysts, on average, expected second-quarter FFO of $1.81 a share, on revenue of $1.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. FFO is a real estate investment trust performance measure that usually excludes gains or losses from property sales and removes the effect that depreciation has on earnings. Simon again raised its FFO forecast for the year to a range of $7.60 to $7.70 per share from the previous $7.50 to $7.60. The company’s forecasts tend to be conservative, and Simon more often than not raises them each quarter. Analysts expect $7.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company, based in Indianapolis, raised its dividend for the fourth consecutive quarter, to $1.05 per share from $1.00 per share. During the second quarter, sales at tenants’ stores at U.S. core portfolio malls and outlet centers rose 9 percent to $554 per square foot, versus a rise of 11.2 percent in the first quarter. Stronger sales attract tenants and eventually lead to higher rents. Landlords also take a share of tenants’ sales. Second-quarter net operating income growth slowed to 5.1 percent from 5.7 percent in the first quarter. Still, new leases called for rents that were 10 percent higher than those that expired. Simon, the only real estate company in the Standard & Poor’s 100 index, owns or has an interest in 336 retail real estate properties in North America and Asia. Its portfolio includes some of the most popular U.S. malls, including Roosevelt Field Mall and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York; The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace Las Vegas; and Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta. Simon has international outlet centers in Malaysia, Canada, Japan, Korea and Europe. It is redeveloping or expanding 25 U.S. properties and two in Japan. Earlier this week, the company hired Matthew Lentz, former managing director and portfolio manager at PointState Capital, to be its first chief investment officer. Lentz will have plenty to work with as the company has access to $6.5 billion in cash under its existing $4.0 billion revolving line of credit and its new multicurrency revolver that can be expanded to $2.5 billion. In Brazil, Simon has formed a joint venture with BR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3.SA) to build 10 to 14 outlets. Its first site, in Sao Paulo, is scheduled to open by early 2014. In China, it has a joint venture to open one outlet mall. Simon also has a 28.7 stake in Klepierre SA (LOIM.PA), Europe’s second-largest retail real estate owner and has three seats on the French company’s board. Simon stock rose $2.08 to $158.02. Since the start of the year, Simon shares are up 21 percent, outperforming the S&P; 500, which is up by 7.4 percent and the MSCI US REIT Index .RMZ, which is up 13 percent.

33,SPG,Police pension fund sues Simon Property board over CEO pay deal,"(Reuters) - A Louisiana pension fund is suing Simon Property Group for not seeking shareholder approval when it raised chief executive David Simon’s compensation last year. In a lawsuit filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System or LAMPERS, accused the company and its board of exceeded its authority by granting the CEO shares worth $120 million to stay on until 2019. David Simon received 1 million long-term-incentive-performance (LTIP) units for him to remain with the company for at least another eight years.

36,SPG,Pershing Square says General Growth should consider sale,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge Fund manager William Ackman on Thursday said mall operator General Growth Properties should put itself up for sale and noted that at least one potential bidder would value it at 51 percent above its current share price. Ackman said that David Simon, chairman and chief executive of No. 1 U.S. mall owner Simon Property Group Inc, might want to buy its smaller rival at a significant premium. The famed investor, who runs $10 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, revealed the suggestions in a letter to General Growth that was made public in a regulatory filing. Pershing Square owns roughly 10.2 percent of General Growth. General Growth said in a press release later in the day that it “will carefully review Pershing Square’s letter.” Ackman approached Simon with the plan for a possible sale, a person familiar with situation said, who declined to be identified because of the private nature of the discussion. General Growth’s shares rose on the news, closing up 10 percent to $20.32 - their highest level since the company emerged from bankruptcy in November 2010. If a deal was reached at the same exchange ratio proposed in October 2011, when it was first discussed, Simon would be paying $28.01 a share for General Growth, whose signature properties include Tysons Galleria in Washington D.C., Glendale Galleria in Los Angeles and Water Tower Place in Chicago, the letter said. Ackman said in the letter that if a sale talked about by him and Simon Property Group nearly a year ago was sealed at the same conditions, shareholders would receive a 51.2 percent premium over General Growth’s closing price on August 22. That proposal discussed between Simon and Ackman did not gain transaction because Brookfield Asset Management, which has a 42.2 percent stake in General Growth, failed to sign off on the deal. Instead, Brookfield had said it would be interested in buying General Growth. In response to Ackman’s letter, Brookfield said that “it is not taking any steps to acquire GGP nor is it having any discussions with third parties in that regard.” However, it also said that in the last 12 months it has considered and discussed possible transactions which would facilitate Pershing Square’s desire to maximize the value of and create liquidity for its interest in General Growth. Ackman’s General Growth holding has been his single best investment bet - earning a 77-fold return on his initial investment. “The one thing that (Bill Ackman) has achieved is he’s just raised the price for Brookfield to take the company over. In that regard I think he is performing a service for all the other shareholders and enriching himself in the process,” said Jeung Hyun, principal and portfolio manager at Adelante Capital Management, which owns General Growth shares. In his eight-page letter, Ackman, known for making a few concentrated bets and then urging companies to shape up to boost the share price, said he only wants things to be fair. “Our goals are to ensure that a level playing field exists so Simon, Brookfield, and potentially other parties can compete to acquire the company,” Ackman wrote to General Growth’s board of directors on Thursday. Ackman also urged the company to take steps to block Brookfield from taking “de facto” control of the company. Brookfield and Simon have a history of battling for General Growth. When General Growth emerged from bankruptcy two years ago it was Brookfield’s plan that helped revive the No. 2 U.S. mall owner. As Brookfield’s stake, which started at 29 percent, grew however, Ackman worried that Brookfield might be getting special perks. For example, the fund manager wrote that General Growth’s chief executive was making presentations alongside Brookfield to potential equity investors to help Brookfield raise capital for future deals. “Once Brookfield indicated that it was interested in acquiring the company, its interests diverged with those of the other GGP shareholders,” Ackman wrote, adding “We, other shareholders, and the board must therefore take a more vigilant and proactive role in protecting our interests.” With General Growth’s stock price surging, Ackman’s Pershing portfolio is sure to get a shot in the arm. His other big investment in retailer J.C. Penney is trading only modestly above the price where he started buying the stock two years ago. In his letter, Ackman was careful to say that he is not accusing Brookfield or General Growth of any wrongdoing in connection with the possible sale and that he only has the shareholder’s interest in mind. “If control of the company is ceded to Brookfield, shareholders will suffer enormous and irreparable harm for they will lose the ability to capture an appropriate control premium for their stakes,” he said in the letter.

38,SPG,Ackman again urges General Growth to sell to Simon,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman on Monday again urged the board of mall owner General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N) to enter into talks with larger rival Simon Property Group (SPG.N), after Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO), General Growth’s largest shareholder, said it was not interested in acquiring all of the company. “GGP’s Board currently has the ability to take steps to prevent Brookfield from unfairly expropriating control from other GGP shareholders,” Ackman, head of Pershing Square Capital Management LP, wrote in a letter to the board. A copy of the letter was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It was the latest salvo in growing public dispute between Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management and Brookfield, that started last week. Ackman last week told General Growth’s board that Brookfield was trying to use its position to acquire all of General Growth for as little as possible. Brookfield, which has about a 42 percent stake in General Growth, last week responded saying it was not interested in acquiring the entire company nor selling its current stake. Finally, Brookfield said it had talked to Pershing Square, at the hedge fund’s request, about “a variety of possible transactions’ which would help Pershing sell its 8 percent stake in General Growth. “At no time has Pershing Square sought liquidity for its GGP stake in conversations with Brookfield, Simon or otherwise,” Ackman wrote in Monday’s letter.

40,SPG,Ackman:General Growth Properties sale to Simon would be best,"NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman, who has been pushing mall operator General Growth Properties to sell itself, on Monday said a deal with rival Simon Property Group would be beneficial to all parties and push the stock price dramatically higher. “A Simon merger is substantially superior to GGP remaining independent,” Ackman said at the 8th annual Value Investing Congress on Monday. A Simon spokesman declined comment on Monday on Ackman’s remarks. But last month, Simon CFO Stephen Sterrett said at the Barclays Capital Global Financial Services Conference, in response to a question about it: “We have not made an offer for General Growth or its properties since 2010 during GGP’s bankruptcies. Nor have we subsequently agreed” on a value for the company, he added. “We have no interest in General Growth,” Sterrett said on Sept. 11 at the Barclays conference. In August, Ackman began urging General Growth to sell itself, and perhaps more importantly, prevent Brookfield Asset Management - which helped pull General Growth out of bankruptcy in 2010 and now owns a 42 percent stake - from taking full control without paying more for it. Ackman said that if a deal between Simon and GGP were closed today, the stock should be trading at $29 at the end of the year. That would represent a dramatic increase from GGP’s closing stock price on Monday of $19. After scooping up General Growth stock early and hanging on through bankruptcy, Ackman has already become very rich on General Growth. He has earned a 77-fold return on the investment. But that does not mean he is ready to throw General Growth to the sidelines, Ackman insisted in August. Simon showed some interest in buying GGP a year ago. On Monday, Ackman told some 500 people attending the conference that this would be an extremely good deal for Simon.

Luxury mall owner Taubman Centers Inc  reported strong sales on Wednesday and raised its outlook for the year. “The retailers have become much more aggressive in paying up for the right (mall) space in good locations, where last year they were much more hesitant to do that,” said Richard Imperiale, president of Uniplan Investment Counsel Inc. Simon shares were down 21 cents to $150.96 in afternoon trade. The shares have come under pressure from speculation that the REIT may try for a second time to buy smaller peer General Growth Properties Inc. Simon tried to buy GGP out of bankruptcy in 2010 but has said it is not interested in a deal now. William Ackman, manager of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital, which owns just over 10 percent of GGP, has been trying to broker such as deal. But Brookfield Asset Management Inc , which controls more than 40 percent of GGP shares, has said it is not interested in selling at this time. “We have no dog in that hunt,” David Simon, Simon Property chairman and chief executive, said during a conference call on Thursday. “This is a discussion between GGP, Brookfield and Pershing Square, and we’re focused on running our business.” Simon reported that third-quarter funds from operations (FFO) rose to $720.1 million, or $1.99 per share, from $606.2 million, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 14.4 percent to $1.23 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected FFO of $1.92 a share on revenue of $1.19 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. FFO is a REIT performance measure that usually excludes gains or losses from property sales and removes the effect that depreciation has on earnings. Simon increased its FFO forecast for the year, excluding one-time items, to a range of $7.80 to $7.85 per share. It previously forecast $7.60 to $7.70. The company’s forecasts tend to be conservative, and Simon often raises them each quarter. Analysts expect $7.76 per share for the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Indianapolis-based Simon raised its quarterly dividend 5 cents to $1.10 per share. In the third quarter, sales, rent and occupancy all increased. Sales at Simon’s tenants’ stores at U.S. core portfolio malls and outlet centers rose 9.3 percent to $562 per square foot on a trailing 12-month basis. Stronger sales attract tenants and eventually lead to higher rents. Also, landlords take a share of tenants’ sales. Late Wednesday, Taubman said sales at its luxury malls rose 10.7 percent to $681 per square foot. Occupancy at Simon’s malls and outlet centers rose to 94.6 percent from 93.8 percent a year earlier, and the company was able to push up average rent 3.8 percent to $40.33 per square foot. Earlier this year, Simon embarked on a massive plan to build new outlet centers and redevelop its existing malls and centers, which could include adding new stores and more parking space. The company is on track to spend $1 billion this year and at least a $1 billion in both 2013 and 2014. Early in the fourth quarter, Simon sold its stakes in Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc and Capital & Counties Properties Plc, netting about $327 million. Simon, the only real estate company in the Standard & Poor’s 100 index, owns or has an interest in 333 retail real estate properties in North America and Asia. Its portfolio includes some of the most popular U.S. malls, including Roosevelt Field Mall and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York; The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace Las Vegas; and Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta. Simon has international outlet centers in Canada, Malaysia,  Japan, Korea and Europe. It is redeveloping or expanding 25 U.S. properties and two in Japan. In Brazil, Simon has formed a joint venture with BR Malls Participacoes SA to build 10 to 14 outlet centers. Its first site, in Sao Paulo, is scheduled to open by early 2014, and construction is expected to start in the next 30 to 60 days. In China, it has a joint venture to open one outlet mall.

54,SPG,Ackman drops push for sale of mall operator,"(Reuters) - After months of trying to play matchmaker between the two largest U.S. shopping mall operators, activist investor William Ackman reversed course on Thursday, saying he is no longer pushing for a sale because one party didn’t want to buy. Since late August, Ackman has argued publicly and often that No. 1 mall operator Simon Property Group (SPG) (SPG.N) should bid for slightly smaller rival General Growth Properties (GGP)(GGP.N), the second-largest mall operator after Simon first made noise about a possible bid for GGP in 2011. But with no signs of a deal, Ackman, whose $11 billion Pershing Square Capital Management owns an 8 percent stake in GGP, declared himself satisfied with the status quo and said he would return to being a passive investor. Ackman is retreating on the mall operators at a time he is devoting fresh energy to other assets in his portfolio and the decision may foreshadow an eventual exit from GGP. “The announcement this morning makes sense because Bill Ackman has been making a lot of headlines lately and sometimes it is good to be seen in a quieter light,” said one investor in Pershing Square who did not want to be identified because the fund is private. “You can only push an investment thesis so far, and I suspect that reading between the lines here, Ackman is beginning to prepare to try and get out of this name as smoothly as possible,” the investor added. Only a few weeks ago, Ackman made a huge splash when he publicly announced that Pershing Square is shorting supplements company Herbalife’s (HLF.N) stock after research suggested to him and his analysts that the company is operating a pyramid scheme. For Ackman, the efforts with the mall operators were close to his heart. Pershing Square’s investment in GGP still ranks as the fund’s most lucrative ever, providing a 77-fold return after the stock was bought years ago and held through bankruptcy. A sale to Simon would have helped push GGP’s stock price even higher and perhaps prevented Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO), which owns a 42 percent stake in GGP, from taking full control without paying for it, Ackman argued in regulatory filings and at public conferences. In October, Ackman said that if a deal were closed between Simon and GGP at that time, the stock price should be trading at $29 a share by year’s end. But General Growth’s shares rose only 9 percent since Ackman first urged the company to consider a sale. On Thursday the stock fell 2.9 percent to $19.46. So in retreating, the New York-based hedge fund manager, known for telling some of America’s biggest companies how to make more money for shareholders, explained that the reason for the change of heart hinges largely on Simon. “In that SPG has chosen not to go forward with that or any other potential transaction with (GGP), and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and its affiliates have subsequently agreed to modify Brookfield’s governance arrangements with (GGP), the Reporting Persons (Ackman and Pershing Square) no longer believe that (GGP)should consider a sale of the Company and it should therefore remain an independent publicly traded corporation,” the filing said.

57,SPG,PIMCO managing director Simon to leave firm,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Scott Simon, a managing director at Pacific Investment Management Co who heads mortgage- and asset-backed securities investing, plans to retire from the manager of the world’s largest bond fund, a source familiar with the situation said. Simon’s departure follows that of Neel Kashkari, managing director and head of global equities at PIMCO, who is leaving the firm to consider running for public office in California as a Republican, according to people familiar with the situation. Simon’s savvy bets in mortgage-backed securities have helped PIMCO, which oversees $1.92 trillion in assets, turn 2012 into one of its most successful years in investing. His departure was first reported by Bloomberg. Mortgage debt is the largest holding of Pimco’s $285 billion Total Return Fund (PTTRX) - the largest mutual fund in the world - after the firm last year repeated a successful bet from 2008 that the Federal Reserve would buy government-backed home-loan securities to boost the economy. The fund, managed by Bill Gross, was 42 percent invested in mortgages in December, down from 44 percent the previous month. The Total Return fund, which is Pacific Investment Management Co’s flagship bond fund, earned a return of 10.36 percent in 2012, besting 88 percent of U.S. intermediate-term bond funds, according to Morningstar. The fund also attracted $18 billion in new cash over the year, Morningstar said.

59,SPG,Simon Property results easily beat Wall Street views again,"(Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) reported a 21.9 percent increase in a key earnings measure for the fourth quarter, easily beating analysts’ estimates, as rents and sales rose at its malls and outlet centers. The No. 1 U.S. mall and outlet center owner also raised its dividend on Monday for the sixth straight quarter. “They just continue to defy gravity,” said Uniplan Investment Counsel President Richard Imperiale, whose fund owns Simon shares. “When you think they’re going to flatten out just because there’s no more room on the upside, they continue to churn out good operating results.” Simon is the first large mall operator to report results for the fourth quarter, when holiday shopping was less than stellar. The only real estate company in the Standard & Poor's 100 index .SPX, Simon owns or has an interest in 328 retail properties in North America and Asia. Simon said fourth-quarter funds from operations had increased to $827.4 million, or $2.29 per share, from $678.9 million, or $1.91 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected FFO of $2.17 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Expense reduction helped Simon exceed Wall Street estimates, Imperiale said. For about the past two years, the company has repeatedly beaten analysts' forecasts. On Monday, its shares rose 70 cents to $162.68. Meanwhile, the S&P; 500 .SPX was down 1 percent and the benchmark REIT index, the MSCI US .RMZ, fell 0.3 percent. FFO, a performance measure for real estate investment trusts, usually excludes gains or losses from property sales and removes the effect that depreciation has on earnings. Simon’s fourth-quarter revenue rose to $1.34 billion from $1.17 billion, while analysts were expecting $1.30 billion. As a real estate investment trust, Simon is required to pay out at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders in exchange for being exempt from most corporate-level income tax. That has prompted Simon to keep raising its dividend. The company raised its quarterly dividend to $1.15 per share from $1.10. The dividend is payable February 28 to shareholders of record on February 14. “We did have a really, really good year,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Simon said on a conference call with analysts. “We worked our a— off in ‘12 to deliver that. We had a lot of moving pieces as we always do. We did a lot of deals. Hopefully, the fruits of those investments did show to some extent in ‘12. But they’ll show more importantly in ‘13 and ‘14.” Simon forecast full-year 2013 FFO, excluding one-time items, at $8.40 to $8.50 per share. Analysts expect $8.41 per share for the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s forecasts tend to be conservative, and Simon often raises them each quarter. Simon’s portfolio includes some of the most popular U.S. malls, including Roosevelt Field Mall and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York, the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta. The company has outlet centers in Canada, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea and in Europe. It is redeveloping or expanding about two dozen properties in the United States and two in Japan. It also has five of its Premium Outlet brand centers under construction - two in the United States - and plans to break ground on a new one in Montreal in the next quarter. Simon plans to spend about $5 billion on development and redevelopment over the next three or four years, David Simon said.

Simon said fourth-quarter funds from operations (FFO) increased to $827.4 million, or $2.29 per share, from $678.9 million, or $1.91 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.34 billion from $1.17 billion. FFO is a real estate investment trust performance measure that usually excludes gains or losses from property sales and removes the income-reducing effect depreciation has on earnings.",2042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/simonpropertygroup-results/simon-property-group-fourth-quarter-ffo-rises-idUSL1N0B1GQN20130204
62,SPG,Fitch Affirms Simon Property Group's IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the credit ratings of  Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG), and its operating partnership, Simon  Property Group, L.P. (collectively, Simon) as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-'; --$39.8 million preferred stock at 'BBB'. Simon Property Group, L.P.     --IDR at 'A-'; --$6 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities at 'A-'; --$13.4 billion senior unsecured notes at 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Key Rating Drivers The affirmation of Simon's IDR at 'A-' reflects the resilient cash flow of the  company's large, high-quality mall and premium outlet portfolio as well as other  retail real estate interests, which underpin a fixed-charge coverage ratio  appropriate for the 'A-' rating. Credit strengths also include the company's  strong management team and track record of accessing multiple sources of  capital. Leverage, though elevated in recent periods, is expected remain  consistent with the 'A-' IDR for a large capitalization retail REIT. The rating  is balanced by Simon's growing development pipeline (largely re-development  projects), although this risk is mitigated by adequate liquidity coverage. The  rating takes into consideration the company's continued appetite for large  acquisitions that temporarily weaken certain debt metrics. Resilient Cash Flow Same-store net operating income growth remained positive throughout the recent  cycle and increased by 4.8% in the mall and premium outlet segment in 2012,  driven by stable occupancy and re-leasing spreads of 10.8% in 2012. Fitch  expects positive same-store results to continue over the next 12-to-24 months as  lease rollover remains positive driven in part by limited new supply. Looking  forward, lease expirations are staggered with small shop revenues expirations of  6.5%, 7.2% and 7.6% in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Anchor lease revenue  expirations are immaterial at 0.8% through 2015.  Diffuse Tenant Base Simon is well positioned to withstand the constantly changing retailer landscape  given the diversification of its tenant roster. Simon's top inline tenants as of  Dec. 31, 2012 were The Gap, Inc. (Fitch IDR of 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook),  which represented 3.2% of base minimum rent, followed by Limited Brands, Inc. at  2.2% and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. at 1.6%. Top anchor tenants have a more limited  contribution to base minimum rents and as of Dec. 31, 2012 included Macy's, Inc.  (Fitch IDR of 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook) at 0.5%, J.C. Penney Co., Inc. (Fitch  IDR of 'B-' with a Negative Outlook) at 0.5%, and Sears Holdings Corporation  (Fitch IDR of 'CCC' with a Negative Outlook) at 0.2%. Many of Simon's tenants  are unrated; however, retailer health as measured by sales per square foot in  Simon's mall and premium outlet portfolio continued an upward trend to $568 in  4Q'12 from $533 in 4Q'11. Continued growth in tenant sales supports Simon's  ability to achieve positive same-store NOI growth.  Solid Fixed-Charge Coverage The above-mentioned favorable operating fundamentals led to fixed-charge  coverage of 2.9x in 2012, compared with 2.9x in 2011 and 2.7x in 2010. Positive  comparable results, coupled with the company's increased interest in The Mills  Limited Partnership assets, cash flows from Simon's 28.9% ownership interest in  Klepierre, and lower cost of debt capital, drove the sustained increase in  coverage.  Under Fitch's base case in which same-store NOI growth remains in the low single  digits and the company realizes incremental cash flow from re-development,  coverage would be in the low-3x range, which would be strong for the 'A-' IDR.  In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which same-store NOI declines and  incremental cash flow from re-development is muted, fixed-charge coverage would  remain in the high 2x range, which would still be appropriate for the 'A-' IDR.  Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including  Fitch's estimate of recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated investments  less recurring capital expenditures less straight-line adjustments, divided by  total interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  Access to Multiple Sources of Capital Simon has a long track record of accessing multiple sources of capital,  including in the depths of the financial crisis. Recent notable transactions  include a $1.2 billion follow-on common stock offering in March 2012 to fund a  portion of the Klepierre investment, a supplemental $2 billion unsecured  revolving credit facility established in June 2012 bringing total revolver  capacity to $6 billion, and two bond offerings totaling $1.3 billion  in  December 2012. Simon is also an active secured borrower in the insurance  company, bank, and CMBS markets. Leverage Expected to be Appropriate Leverage was 6.0x in 2012, an elevated level compared with 5.6x in 2011 and 5.7x  in 2010. Debt incurrence associated with various acquisitions (including  wholly-owned assets and joint ventures) and development projects drove the  increase in leverage. Under Fitch's base case, leverage would be in the 5.5x to 6.0x range over the  next several years, which would be appropriate for the 'A-' IDR for a large  retail REIT. Under a stress case not anticipated by Fitch, leverage sustains  above 6.0x, which would be commensurate with a 'BBB+' IDR. Fitch defines  leverage as net debt to recurring operating EBITDA including Fitch's estimate of  recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated investments.  Large Portfolio Simon is the largest publicly traded REIT with an equity market capitalization  of $57.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2012, and its diversified retail portfolio  reduces reliance on regional retail drivers. For 2012, the company's top five  states by NOI contribution were Florida at 14.5%, Texas at 11.2%, California at  11%, New York at 6.8% and Massachusetts at 6.6%, with no other state exceeding  5.7% of total NOI. Simon also has investments outside the U.S. via interests in  or joint ventures with local owners (e.g., Calloway Real Estate Investment Trust  in Canada, Shinsegae International Co. in Korea) that further diversify its  geographical risk.  Growing Development Pipeline Simon's U.S. and international development pipeline included $1.2 billion in pro  rata net cost to complete as of Dec. 31, 2012, and the company will likely incur  similar annual funding requirements over the next several years. Projects vary  widely and include new outlet construction, expansions, and re-configurations.  Unfunded development costs to complete for U.S. projects represented 2.4% of  undepreciated cost basis assets as of Dec. 31, 2012, which is still below the  pre-crisis level of 4.2% as of Dec. 31, 2007.  Liquidity coverage is adequate at 1.3x for Jan. 1, 2013 to Dec. 31, 2014,  despite growing development. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity  sources divided by liquidity uses. Sources include unrestricted cash,  availability under Simon's unsecured revolving credit facilities and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends. Uses include pro  rata debt maturities and projected recurring capital expenditures. If the  company refinances 90% of upcoming secured debt maturities, liquidity coverage  would improve to 2.2x. Fitch calculates that the company's common stock dividends and distributions  represented only 73.1% of funds from operations adjusted for capital  expenditures and straight-line rents, reflective of substantial  internally-generated liquidity. Significant Financial Flexibility Of the company's 329 properties in North America and Asia, 165 are unencumbered,  providing significant financial flexibility. Unencumbered assets (2012  unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 7% capitalization rate) covered unsecured  debt by 2.2x as of Dec. 31, 2012, which is low for the 'A-' IDR. However,  unencumbered asset quality is strong, with 127 unencumbered Malls and Premium  Outlets producing sales of approximately $732 per square foot compared with $568  per square foot for Malls and Premium Outlets overall. In addition, the  covenants in the company's debt agreements do not restrict financial  flexibility. Stable Outlook  The stable outlook is predicated on coverage being strong at or just above 3x,  offset by leverage sustaining between 5.5x and 6.0x, along with adequate  liquidity coverage. Simon has a long track record of acquisitions, including  Prime Outlets in 2010 for $2.3 billion, The Mills Corporation in 2007 for $4  billion, and Chelsea Property Group in 2004 for $5.1 billion. These transactions  have diversified Simon across the retail spectrum, given SPG exposure to the  value segment within retail, and provided opportunities to leverage tenant  relationships and back office capabilities. However, in some cases such as the  Klepierre investment, certain credit metrics have temporarily weakened. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between Simon's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'A-'.  Based on Fitch Research on 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site at  www.fitchratings.com, these preferred securities are deeply subordinated and  have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the  event of a corporate default. Rating Sensitivities The following factors may have a positive impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x (coverage  was 2.9x in 2012); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 5.0x (leverage was 6.0x in  2012). The following factors may have a negative impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 2.3x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.0x beyond 2014; --Liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x (this metric is 1.3x for Jan. 1, 2013  to Dec. 31, 2014).

63,SPG,Simon sees no sale-leasebacks as mall occupancy rises,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N), the largest owner of U.S. malls, has little interest in buying department store space from retailers and leasing it back, a senior executive said on Friday, a stance that may limit options for cash-strapped J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N). Penney, which has 111 stores in Simon malls across the country, has been talking with its financial advisers about ways to raise capital after a botched turnaround that led to a steep sales slump. Sale-leasebacks may be one of those options, analysts have said. “I do not believe we believe we would be interested in sale-leasebacks,” Richard Sokolov, president of the real estate investment trust, said during a conference call when analysts asked him about the company’s general position on the subject. Simon may have little reason to be interested. Earlier it reported funds from operations, a closely watched measure of REIT earnings, rose 14.4 percent in the first quarter. Rents, sales and occupancy at its malls and outlet centers all rose, and it boosted its forecast for the year. Shares of Simon were little changed at $175.91 on the New York Stock Exchange. Since the start of the year, the stock has risen 11.5 percent, while shares of its nearest competitor, General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), increased 9.9 percent. Of the 635 department stores in Simon’s U.S. portfolio, only six or seven are vacant, and there’s a line of prospective tenants, many of them in retail categories that traditionally set up shop outside malls including supermarkets, theaters and health clubs. It’s part of a diversification that is attracting more shoppers to malls and the stores that pay rent there. Simon is adding hotels and apartment buildings to some of its U.S. properties, while CBL & Associates Properties Inc (CBL.N) has leased mall space to libraries. “To the extent they can put them all in one box-like destination for a community, that seems to work out really well,” said Richard Imperiale, president of Uniplan Investment Counsel Inc, a fund that owns Simon shares. Simon’s FFO increased to $741.9 million, or $2.05 a share, from $648.7 million, or $1.82, a year earlier Analysts, on average, expected FFO of $2.01 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. FFO is a performance measure that is closely watched because it usually excludes gains or losses from property sales and removes the effect of depreciation on earnings. Simon maintained its quarterly dividend at $1.15 per share after raising it for the past six quarters, but it said it would likely restart the increases. “We anticipate - subject to review and board approval - increasing our dividend as we anticipate our taxable income continuing to grow,” David Simon, the company’s chief executive and chairman, said during the call. As a REIT, Simon is required to distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders. First-quarter sales, rent and occupancy all increased. Sales at tenants’ stores at its U.S. core portfolio malls and outlet centers rose 5.3 percent on a trailing 12-month basis to $575 per square foot. Some 121 of its U.S. properties averaged tenant sales of more than $700 per square foot. Stronger sales attract tenants and eventually lead to higher rents. Also, landlords take a share of tenants’ sales. Occupancy at Simon’s malls and outlet centers rose to 94.7 percent from 93.6 percent a year earlier, and it was able to push up rents by 13.4 percent for new leases. The average base rent was $41.05 per square foot. Net operating income, which reflects how well properties owned for at least a year are being managed, rose 4.8 percent. Simon raised its full-year FFO forecast, excluding one-time items, to a range of $8.50 to $8.60 per share from $8.40 to $8.50. Analysts expect $8.59 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Simon, the only real estate company in the Standard & Poor's 100 index .SPX, owns or has an interest in 327 retail properties in North America and Asia. Its portfolio includes some popular U.S. malls, including Roosevelt Field Mall and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York, the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta. The company has international outlet centers in Canada, Malaysia, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Europe. It also has a 28.7 percent stake in Klepierre SA (LOIM.PA), Europe’s second-largest retail real estate owner.

65,SPG,Simon Property results speed past Wall Street estimates,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) said a key earnings measure rose 14.4 percent in the first quarter, helped by higher rents and sales at its malls and outlet centers, prompting the company to raise its forecast for the year. Simon also ended its six-quarter streak of raising dividends. Funds from operations (FFO) increased to $741.9 million, or $2.05 per share, from $648.7 million, or $1.82 per share, a year earlier, Simon, the largest U.S. owner of malls and shopping centers, said on Friday.

67,SPG,Klepierre eyes cash gains as malls resist slowdown,"PARIS, July 22 (Reuters) - French real-estate group Klepierre, co-owned by Simon Property and BNP Paribas , said it was targeting higher-than-expected cash flows this year as its shopping malls resist Europe’s slowdown. Klepierre said rental income from its mall-focused portfolio grew by 2.8 percent in the first half of 2013, helped by prime assets in Western Europe and Scandinavia. Net current cash flow per share is now expected to grow by at least 3 percent for all of 2013, compared with a previous target of up to 2.5 percent. Klepierre is benefiting from a strategy of selling some of its French shopping centres and offices while refurbishing and extending others to lift rental profits. It has also lifted profits by cutting its cost of funding with new credit lines.

68,SPG,Simon Property raises outlook as profit tops expectations,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N), the largest owner of U.S. malls and outlet centers, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Monday, boosted by increased occupancy and rent, and the company raised its earnings forecast for the year. Simon’s malls and outlets include some of the highest-quality U.S. properties, where demand for space from retailers keeps growing. Weaker malls are feeling more acutely the effects of wary consumers and competition from online shopping. Simon has been able to post higher results and lower its cost of capital by redeveloping its properties, including modernizing, adding store space and expanding parking facilities. Simon also is adding supermarkets, such as Wegmans to the Montgomery Mall in North Wales, Pennsylvania, and Fairway Market to The Shops at Nanuet, in Nanuet, New York. “They’re grinding it out one mall at a time, one project at a time, one opportunity at a time, but they do it very well,” said Richard Imperiale, president of Uniplan Investment Counsel Inc, a fund that owns Simon shares. “They’re good at basic blocking and tackling.” Simon’s second-quarter funds from operations, an earnings measure for real estate investment trusts, rose 11.25 percent to $766.3 million, or $2.11 per share, from $688.8 million, or $1.89 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $2.07 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. FFO is closely watched because it usually excludes gains or losses from property sales and removes the effect of depreciation on earnings. Simon, which is the only real estate company in the Standard & Poor’s 100 index and owns or has an interest in 325 retail properties in North America and Asia, raised its full-year FFO forecast, excluding one-time items, to a range of $8.60 to $8.70 per share from $8.50 to $8.60. Analysts expected $8.68, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales, rents and occupancy rose in the quarter, Simon said. Sales at tenants’ stores at its U.S. core portfolio malls and outlet centers averaged $577 per square foot in the 12 months ended June 30, up 4.2 percent from the previous 12 months. Smaller rival Taubman Centers Inc (TCO.N) reported flat sales for the quarter. Stronger sales attract tenants and eventually lead to higher rents. Landlords also take a share of tenants’ sales. Simon said the average base rent rose 3.6 percent to $41.41 in the quarter, and new leases called for rents that were 14.1 percent higher than those in leases that expired, up from a 10 percent increase in the year-earlier period. Occupancy at Simon’s malls and outlet centers rose to 95.1 percent from 94.2 percent a year earlier. Net operating income, which reflects how well properties owned for at least a year are being managed, rose 5.9 percent at its U.S. properties. Simon’s portfolio includes some of the most popular U.S. malls and outlets, including Roosevelt Field Mall and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York, the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and the Galleria in Houston.

69,SPG,UPDATE 3-Simon Property raises outlook as profit tops expectations,"* Second-quarter FFO/shr $2.11 vs Wall St’s $2.07 * Company increases full-year forecast * Second-quarter rent, occupancy and sales rise * Shares slip 0.7 pct By Ilaina Jonas NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc , the largest owner of U.S. malls and outlet centers, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Monday, boosted by increased occupancy and rent, and the company raised its earnings forecast for the year. Simon’s malls and outlets include some of the highest-quality U.S. properties, where demand for space from retailers keeps growing. Weaker malls are feeling more acutely the effects of wary consumers and competition from online shopping. Simon has been able to post higher results and lower its cost of capital by redeveloping its properties, including modernizing, adding store space and expanding parking facilities. Simon also is adding supermarkets, such as Wegmans to the Montgomery Mall in North Wales, Pennsylvania, and Fairway Market to The Shops at Nanuet, in Nanuet, New York. “They’re grinding it out one mall at a time, one project at a time, one opportunity at a time, but they do it very well,” said Richard Imperiale, president of Uniplan Investment Counsel Inc, a fund that owns Simon shares. “They’re good at basic blocking and tackling.” Simon’s second-quarter funds from operations, an earnings measure for real estate investment trusts, rose 11.25 percent to $766.3 million, or $2.11 per share, from $688.8 million, or $1.89 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $2.07 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. FFO is closely watched because it usually excludes gains or losses from property sales and removes the effect of depreciation on earnings. Simon, which is the only real estate company in the Standard & Poor’s 100 index and owns or has an interest in 325 retail properties in North America and Asia, raised its full-year FFO forecast, excluding one-time items, to a range of $8.60 to $8.70 per share from $8.50 to $8.60. Analysts expected $8.68, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales, rents and occupancy rose in the quarter, Simon said. Sales at tenants’ stores at its U.S. core portfolio malls and outlet centers averaged $577 per square foot in the 12 months ended June 30, up 4.2 percent from the previous 12 months. Smaller rival Taubman Centers Inc reported flat sales for the quarter. Stronger sales attract tenants and eventually lead to higher rents. Landlords also take a share of tenants’ sales. Simon said the average base rent rose 3.6 percent to $41.41 in the quarter, and new leases called for rents that were 14.1 percent higher than those in leases that expired, up from a 10 percent increase in the year-earlier period. Occupancy at Simon’s malls and outlet centers rose to 95.1 percent from 94.2 percent a year earlier. Net operating income, which reflects how well properties owned for at least a year are being managed, rose 5.9 percent at its U.S. properties. Simon’s portfolio includes some of the most popular U.S. malls and outlets, including Roosevelt Field Mall and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York, the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and the Galleria in Houston. Its outlet business includes centers in Canada, Malaysia, Japan, Korea, and Mexico. The company has a 28.7 percent stake in Klepierre SA , Europe’s second-largest retail real estate owner.

72,SPG,"Fitch Rates Simon Property Group, L.P.'s EUR750MM Sr Unsecured Notes 'A-'; Outlook Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a credit rating of  'A-' to the EUR750 million aggregate principal amount 2.375% coupon senior  unsecured notes due 2020 issued by Simon Property Group, L.P., the operating  partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG).  The notes were priced at  99.675% of par to yield 2.426% to maturity, or 123.5 basis points over the  benchmark rate. Simon Property Group, L.P. expects to use the proceeds from the notes to repay  euro-denominated borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility and  for general corporate purposes. Fitch currently rates Simon Property Group, Inc. and Simon Property Group, L.P.  (collectively, Simon) as follows:  Simon Property Group, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-'; --$39.8 million preferred stock 'BBB'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --IDR 'A-'; --$6.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities and term loan 'A-'; --$14 billion senior unsecured notes 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'A-' IDR reflects the resilient cash flow of the company's large,  high-quality mall and premium outlet portfolio as well as other retail real  estate interests, which underpin a fixed-charge coverage ratio appropriate for  the 'A-' rating. Credit strengths also include the company's strong management  team and track record of accessing multiple sources of capital.  Leverage is  expected remain consistent with the 'A-' IDR for a large capitalization retail  REIT.  The rating is balanced by Simon's growing development pipeline (largely  re-development projects), although this risk is mitigated by adequate liquidity  coverage.  The rating takes into consideration the company's continued appetite  for large acquisitions that temporarily weaken certain debt metrics. RESILIENT CASH FLOW Same-store net operating income growth remained positive throughout the recent  cycle and increased by 5.9% in the mall and premium outlet segment in 2Q'13,  driven by stable occupancy and positive re-leasing spreads of 14.1% during the  quarter. Fitch expects positive same-store results will continue over the next  12-to-24 months as lease rollover remains positive driven in part by limited new  supply.  Looking forward, lease expirations are well staggered with small shop lease  expirations of 1.5%, 7.4% and 8.0% of revenues in 2013, 2014 and 2015,  respectively. Anchor lease revenue expirations are immaterial through 2015,  totaling only 0.7% of gross annualized rental revenues. DIFFUSE TENANT BASE Simon is well positioned to withstand the constantly changing retailer landscape  given the diversification of its tenant roster. Simon's top inline tenants as of  June 30, 2013 were The Gap, Inc. (Fitch IDR of 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook),  which represented 3.2% of base minimum rent, followed by L Brands, Inc. at 2.2%  and Phillips-Van Heusen at 1.6%. Top anchor tenants have a more limited  contribution to base minimum rents and as of Dec. 31, 2012 included Macy's, Inc.  (IDR of 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook) at 0.5%, J.C. Penney Co., Inc. (IDR of 'B-'  with a Negative Outlook) at 0.5%, and Sears Holdings Corporation (IDR of 'CCC'  with a Negative Outlook) at 0.2%.  Many of Simon's tenants are unrated; however, retailer health as measured by  sales per square foot in Simon's mall and premium outlet portfolio continued an  upward trend to $577 in 2Q'13 from $554 in 2Q'12. Continued growth in tenant  sales supports Simon's ability to continue to achieve positive same-store net  operating income (NOI) growth. SOLID FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE The aforementioned favorable operating fundamentals led to fixed-charge coverage  of 3.0x in 2Q'13 pro forma for the bond offering, compared with 2.9x in both  2012 and 2011. Positive comparable results, coupled with the company's increased  interest in The Mills Limited Partnership assets, cash dividends from Simon's  28.9% ownership interest in Klepierre, and lower cost of debt capital, drove the  sustained increase in coverage. Under Fitch's base case in which same-store NOI growth remains in the low single  digits and the company realizes incremental cash flow from re-development,  coverage would be in the low-3x range, which would be strong for the 'A-' IDR.  In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which same-store NOI declines and  incremental cash flow from re-development is muted, fixed-charge coverage would  remain in the high 2x range, which would still be appropriate for the 'A-' IDR. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including  Fitch's estimate of recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated investments  less recurring capital expenditures less straight-line adjustments, divided by  total interest incurred and preferred stock dividends. ACCESS TO MULTIPLE SOURCES OF CAPITAL Simon has a long track record of accessing multiple sources of capital,  including in the depths of the financial crisis. Recent notable transactions  other than the EUR750 million bond offering include two U.S.-dollar-denominated  bond offerings totaling $1.3 billion in December 2012 and a supplemental $2  billion unsecured revolving credit facility established in June 2012 (bringing  total revolver capacity to $6 billion).  Simon is also an active secured  borrower in the insurance company, bank, and CMBS markets.  The euro-denominated  bond offering match-funds Simon's euro-denominated investments, limiting  currency exchange rate risk. LEVERAGE MODERATING Leverage was 5.7x in 2Q'13, compared with 6.0x in 2012 and 5.6x in 2011.  Debt  incurrence associated with various acquisitions (including wholly-owned assets  and joint ventures) and development projects drove the increase in leverage in  2012.  Leverage has recently declined with debt repayment via retained cash  flow.   Under Fitch's base case, leverage is forecasted to be in the 5.5x to 6.0x range  over the next several years, which would be appropriate for the 'A-' IDR for a  large retail REIT. Under a stress case not anticipated by Fitch, leverage is  forecasted to sustain above 6.0x, which would be commensurate with a 'BBB+' IDR.  Fitch defines leverage as net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA including  Fitch's estimate of recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  investments. LARGE PORTFOLIO/STRONG FRANCHISE Simon is the largest publicly traded REIT in the U.S., with an equity market  capitalization of $57.3 billion as of June 30, 2013, and its diversified retail  portfolio reduces reliance on regional retail drivers. For 2Q'13, the company's  top five states by NOI contribution were Florida at 14.9%, Texas at 11.5%,  California at 11%, New York at 6.5% and Massachusetts at 6.2%, with no other  state exceeding 5.4% of total NOI. Simon also has investments outside the U.S.  via interests in or joint ventures with local owners (e.g. Calloway Real Estate  Investment Trust in Canada, Shinsegae International Co. in Korea) that further  diversify its geographical risk. GROWING DEVELOPMENT PIPLEINE Simon's U.S. and international development pipeline included $1.3 billion in pro  rata net cost to complete as of June 30, 2013, and the company will likely incur  similar annual funding requirements over the next several years. Projects vary  widely and include new outlet construction, expansions, and re-configurations.  Unfunded development costs to complete for U.S. projects represented 3.2% of  undepreciated cost basis assets as of June 30, 2013, which is still below the  pre-crisis level of 4.2% as of Dec. 31, 2007. Liquidity coverage is adequate at 1.1x for July 1, 2013 to Dec. 31, 2015,  despite growing development. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity  sources divided by liquidity uses. Sources include unrestricted cash,  availability under Simon's unsecured revolving credit facilities pro forma for  the bond offering, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities  after dividends. Uses include pro rata debt maturities and projected recurring  capital expenditures. If the company refinances 90% of upcoming secured debt  maturities, liquidity coverage would improve to 1.8x.  Fitch calculates that the company's common stock dividends and distributions  represented 76.7% of funds from operations adjusted for capital expenditures and  straight-line rents during the first half of 2013, reflective of substantial  internally-generated liquidity.  SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Unencumbered assets (2Q'13 unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 7%  capitalization rate) covered net unsecured debt by 2.4x as of June 30, 2013,  which is low for the 'A-' IDR. However, unencumbered asset quality is strong, as  the unencumbered assets produced sales of approximately $732 per square foot  compared with $568 for the portfolio overall in 2012. In addition, the covenants  in the company's debt agreements do not restrict financial flexibility. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook is predicated on coverage being strong at or just above 3x,  offset by Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining between 5.5x and 6.0x,  along with adequate liquidity coverage. Simon has a long track record of  acquisitions, including Prime Outlets in 2010 for $2.3 billion, The Mills  Corporation in 2007 for $4 billion, and Chelsea Property Group in 2004 for $5.1  billion. These transactions have diversified Simon across the retail spectrum,  given SPG exposure to the value segment within retail, and have provided  opportunities to leverage tenant relationships and back office capabilities.  However, in some cases, such as the Klepierre investment in 2012, certain credit  metrics have temporarily weakened.  PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING The two-notch differential between Simon's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'A-'.  Based on Fitch Research on 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site at  www.fitchratings.com, these preferred securities are deeply subordinated and  have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the  event of a corporate default.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on Simon's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x (coverage  was 3.0x in 2Q'13 pro forma); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 5.0x (leverage was 5.7x in  2Q2013). The following factors may have a negative impact on Simon's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 2.3x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.0x beyond 2014; --Liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x (coverage is forecasted to be 1.1x  for July 1, 2013 to Dec. 31, 2015 pro forma).

73,SPG,U.S. still has too many strip malls - report,"NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The average vacancy rate for a U.S. strip mall was unchanged in the third quarter, as the sector still wrestled with the oversupply that closely followed last decade’s housing boom, according to a report real estate research firm Reis Inc released on Wednesday. While large malls did not have the same problem with oversupply, some are better off than others. Some of the best ones owned by real estate investment trusts such as Simon Property Group Inc enjoy vacancies rates of about 5 percent. Others limp along with 40 percent of the space vacant. Even the stronger ones and their retail tenants are still confronting competition from online shopping and are figuring out ways to co-exist. “Retail is incredibly sticky,” Reis Chief Economist Victor Calanog said. “I don’t know what you do with these retail centers. As long as your pulling in some money from existing tenants, a lot of them limp along.” In the third quarter, the national vacancy for strip malls was 10.5 percent, unchanged from the second quarter and down 0.3 percentage point from a year earlier, according to preliminary figures by Reis. But it still was only 0.6 percentage point off of the peak rate of 11.1 percent seen two years ago, Reis said. These shopping centers are usually anchored by supermarkets or large drug stores. Developers have been loathe to build new centers. So far this year, only 3.6 million square feet of new space has been brought to market, on track to break the 32-year record low set in 2010, when 4.5 million square feet opened, Reis said. Asking rent at these strip malls inched up 0.3 percent to $19.25 per square foot. Effective rent, which factors in months of free rent and other perks landlords offer to keep or attract tenants, rose 0.4 percent to $16.75 per square foot, up just 1.1 percent year over year. Meanwhile, permitting restrictions and large costs have helped keep the supply of new malls much tighter. Still, the recession, credit crisis, slow recovery have impacted the sector’s rebound. In the third quarter, the national vacancy rate dipped to 8.2 percent, down 0.1 percentage point from the third quarter, down 0.5 percentage point from a year earlier and off from the cyclical peak vacancy rate of 9.4 percent in the third quarter 2011. Asking rents grew by 0.4 percent in the third quarter and 1.4 percent from a year ago to $39.77 a square foot. It as the tenth consecutive quarter of rent increases at the national level for regional malls, Reis said.

Stronger sales attract tenants and eventually lead to higher rents. Also, landlords take a share of tenant sales. Occupancy at Simon’s malls and outlet centers rose to 95.5 percent from 94.6 percent a year earlier, and it was able to push up base rents by 3.5 percent for new leases.

76,SPG,Simon Property to spin off smaller malls into REIT,"(Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N), the largest owner of U.S. malls and outlet centers, will spin off its strip malls and smaller shopping centers into a publicly traded REIT to focus solely on its larger retail properties. The company has been focusing on its larger malls, which provide higher returns. This has held back the expansion of its strip malls and smaller shopping centers. “Over the years, we have seen a number of very attractive investment opportunities ... that we have not pursued given our primary focus on our global portfolio of larger retail assets,” Chief Executive David Simon said on a conference call. The real estate investment trust (REIT) is expected to initially own or have an interest in 54 strip malls as well as in 44 smaller enclosed malls with annual net operating income of up to $10 million each. Analysts agreed that the smaller malls would be better off as a separate company. “I think the company looked at it and said ... if we can have a dedicated team focused 100 percent on the B-malls and the shopping centers, that maybe one plus one equals three,” Sandler O’Neill analyst Alex Goldfarb told Reuters. Simon Property said the spinoff, through a distribution to shareholders, would boost its sales per square foot, net operating income and occupancy rates. The company said it would maintain its annualized dividend at $4.80 per share. The spinoff will make it easier for Simon Property to pursue acquisitions without facing anti-trust hurdles, Jefferies analyst Omotayo Okusanya said. General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N) spun off 30 malls into a new company, Rouse Properties Inc RSE.N, in 2011 to focus on large retail assets. Rouse Properties shares have risen about 75 percent since it went public in December 2011. Richard Sokolow, Simon Property’s president and chief operating officer, will be the chairman of the new company’s board. Chief Executive Simon will be a director. The new company’s funds from operations are expected to be about $300 million, or 80 cents per share, in the first year, Simon Property said. The company said the REIT’s dividend was estimated to be at least 50 cents per share in the first year, representing 100 percent of taxable income. REITs, which must pay out at least 90 percent of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends, are subject to lower taxes and pay higher dividends than other companies. The only real estate company in the Standard & Poor's 100 index .SPX, Simon Property owns or has an interest in 325 retail properties in North America and Asia. The company’s portfolio includes Roosevelt Field Mall and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York, Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta.

80,SPG,"Fitch: Simon Property Group, Inc.'s 'A-' IDR Unaffected by Spin-Off; Outlook Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 17 (Fitch) The planned spin-off of the strip center business  and smaller enclosed malls by Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) will not  affect the company's 'A-' Issuer Default Rating and Stable Outlook, according to  Fitch Ratings. The transaction, which is expected to close in 2Q2014, is credit  neutral; benefits to SPG bondholders include a refined strategic focus on  higher-quality larger malls, The Mills and premium outlets. Higher quality cash  flow is offset by a modest increase in leverage. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'A-' IDR reflects the resilient cash flow of the company's large,  high-quality mall and premium outlet portfolio as well as other retail real  estate interests, which underpin a fixed-charge coverage ratio strong for the  'A-' rating. Credit strengths also include the company's strong management team  and track record of accessing multiple sources of capital. Leverage is expected  remain consistent with the 'A-' IDR for a large capitalization retail REIT. The rating is balanced by Simon's growing development pipeline (largely  re-development projects), although this risk is mitigated by adequate liquidity  coverage. The rating takes into consideration the company's track record of  large acquisitions that in certain cases have temporarily weakened certain debt  metrics. Resilient Cash Flow Same-store net operating income growth remained positive throughout the recent  cycle and increased by 5.2% in the mall and premium outlet segment for the  year-to-date period ended Sept. 30, 2013, driven by stable occupancy and  positive re-leasing spreads of 15.2% during the 3Q2013 after 14.1% growth in  2Q2013 and 13.4% growth in 1Q2013. Fitch expects positive same-store results  will continue over the next 12-to-24 months as lease rollover remains positive  driven in part by limited new supply. Looking forward, lease expirations are well staggered with inline store and  freestanding lease expirations of 0.8%, 7.1% and 8% of revenues in 4Q2013, 2014  and 2015, respectively. Anchor lease revenue expirations are immaterial through  2015, totaling only 0.5% of gross annualized rental revenues. Diffuse Tenant Base Simon is well positioned to withstand the constantly changing retailer landscape  given the diversification of its tenant roster. Simon's top inline tenants as of  Sept. 30, 2013 were The Gap, Inc. (Fitch IDR 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook),  which represented 3.2% of base minimum rent, followed by L Brands, Inc. at 2.2%  and Phillips-Van Heusen at 1.6%. Top anchor tenants have a more limited  contribution to base minimum rents and as of Dec. 31, 2012 included Macy's, Inc.  (IDR 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook) at 0.5%, J.C. Penney Co., Inc. (IDR 'CCC') at  0.5%, and Sears Holdings Corporation (IDR 'CCC') at 0.2%. Many of Simon's tenants are unrated, but retailer health as measured by sales  per square foot in Simon's mall and premium outlet portfolio is strong. Simon's  pre-spin-off total sales PSF were $579 compared with $616 post-spin-off.  Continued growth in tenant sales supports Simon's ability to continue to achieve  positive same-store net operating income (NOI) growth. Solid Fixed-Charge Coverage The aforementioned favorable operating fundamentals led to fixed-charge coverage  of 3.0x for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2013, compared with 2.9x in  both 2012 and 2011. Positive comparable results, coupled with the company's  increased interest in The Mills Limited Partnership assets, cash dividends from  Simon's 28.9% ownership interest in Klepierre, and lower cost of debt capital,  drove the sustained increase in coverage. Under Fitch's base case in which same-store NOI growth remains in the low single  digits and the company realizes incremental cash flow from re-development,  coverage would be in the high 2x range, which would be strong for the 'A-' IDR.  In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which same-store NOI declines and  incremental cash flow from re-development is muted, fixed-charge coverage would  remain in the high 2x range, which would still be appropriate for the 'A-' IDR. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including  Fitch's estimate of recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated investments  less recurring capital expenditures less straight-line adjustments, divided by  total interest incurred and preferred stock dividends. Access to Multiple Sources of Capital Simon has a long track record of accessing multiple sources of capital,  including in the depths of the financial crisis. Recent notable transactions  include a EUR750 million bond offering in September 2013, two  U.S.-dollar-denominated bond offerings totaling $1.3 billion in December 2012  and a supplemental $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility established in  June 2012 (bringing total revolver capacity to $6 billion). Simon is also an  active secured borrower in the insurance company, bank, and CMBS markets.  Appropriate Leverage Leverage was 5.6x in 3Q'13, compared with 6.0x in 2012 and 5.6x in 2011. Debt  incurrence associated with various acquisitions (including wholly-owned assets  and joint ventures) and development projects drove the increase in leverage in  2012. Leverage has recently declined with debt repayment via retained cash flow.  Leverage is expected to increase modestly post-spin-off. Over the longer term,  leverage is forecasted to be in the 5.5x to 6.0x range, which remains  appropriate for the 'A-' IDR for a large retail REIT. Under a stress case not  anticipated by Fitch, leverage is forecasted to sustain above 6.0x, which would  be commensurate with a 'BBB+' IDR. Fitch defines leverage as net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA including Fitch's estimate of recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated investments. Large Portfolio/Strong Franchise Simon is the largest publicly traded REIT in the U.S., with an equity market  capitalization of $53.8 billion as of Sept. 30, 2013, and its diversified retail  portfolio reduces reliance on regional retail drivers. For the nine months ended  Sept. 30, 2013, the company's top five states by NOI contribution were Florida  at 14.9%, Texas at 11.4%, California at 11%, New York at 6.5% and Massachusetts  at 6.4%, with no other state exceeding 5.3% of total NOI. Simon also has  investments outside the U.S. via interests in or joint ventures with local  owners (e.g. Calloway Real Estate Investment Trust in Canada, Shinsegae  International Co. in Korea) that further diversify its geographical risk.  Growing Development Pipeline Simon's U.S. and international development pipeline included $1.3 billion in pro  rata net cost to complete as of Sept. 30, 2013, and the company will likely  incur similar annual funding requirements over the next several years. The  spin-off transaction will enable SPG to focus its efforts on various projects  including new outlet construction, expansions, and re-configurations.  Unfunded development costs to complete for U.S. projects represented 2.1% of  undepreciated cost basis assets as of Sept. 30, 2013, which is still below the  pre-crisis level of 4.2% as of Dec. 31, 2007. Adequate Liquidity Liquidity coverage is adequate at 1.1x for Oct. 1, 2013 to Dec. 31, 2015,  despite growing development. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity  sources divided by liquidity uses. Sources include unrestricted cash,  availability under Simon's unsecured revolving credit facilities, and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends. Uses include pro  rata debt maturities and projected recurring capital expenditures. If the  company refinances 90% of upcoming secured debt maturities, liquidity coverage  would improve to 1.8x. Liquidity excludes the impact of cash proceeds from the  spin-off and a special dividend that SPG plans to pay upon the closing of the  spin-off transaction. Fitch calculates that the company's common stock dividends and distributions  represented 60.9% of funds from operations adjusted for capital expenditures and  straight-line rents during year-to-date period ended Sept. 30, 2013, reflective  of substantial internally-generated liquidity.  Significant Financial Flexibility Unencumbered assets (3Q'13 unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 7%  capitalization rate) covered net unsecured debt by 2.4x as of Sept. 30, 2013,  which is low for the 'A-' IDR. However, unencumbered asset quality is strong, as  the unencumbered assets produced sales of approximately $732 per square foot  compared with $568 for the portfolio overall in 2012. In addition, the covenants  in the company's debt agreements do not restrict financial flexibility. Fitch currently rates Simon Property Group, Inc. and Simon Property Group, L.P.  (collectively, Simon) as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-'; --$39.8 million preferred stock 'BBB'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --IDR 'A-'; --$6.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities and term loan 'A-'; --$12.9 billion senior unsecured notes 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook is predicated on coverage being strong in the high 2x range,  offset by Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining between 5.5x and 6.0x,  along with adequate liquidity coverage. Simon has a long track record of  refining the portfolio and leveraging tenant relationships including the via  planned spin-off transaction in 2014, as well as the acquisitions of Prime  Outlets in 2010 for $2.3 billion, The Mills Corporation in 2007 for $4 billion,  and Chelsea Property Group in 2004 for $5.1 billion.  Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between Simon's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR 'A-'. Based  on Fitch Research on 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site at  www.fitchratings.com, these preferred securities are deeply subordinated and  have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the  event of a corporate default. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on Simon's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x (coverage  was 3.0x in 3Q2013 but 2.7x pro forma for the spin-off); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 5.0x (leverage was 5.6x in  3Q2013 though expected to rise modestly post-spin-off). The following factors may have a negative impact on Simon's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 2.3x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.0x beyond 2014; --Liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x (coverage is forecasted to be 1.1x  for Oct. 1, 2013 to Dec. 31, 2015).

81,SPG,COLUMN-Will last year's stock market laggards be 2014's winners?,"CHICAGO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - If the stock market rally continues, last year’s laggards may be this year’s winners. Many of the sectors that could do well are late bloomers in the five-year bull run. They may not seem like obvious choices, yet are worthwhile if you’re contrarian or slightly defensive. Assuming economic fundamentals and corporate earnings remain solid, it could be a decent year for stocks overall and even better for companies that were neglected in 2013. “I’m optimistic,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial in Chicago, who predicts three-percent GDP growth and the creation of up to three million jobs this year. “I haven’t felt bullish in a long time,” Swonk said at the annual economic outlook luncheon of the Executive Club of Chicago on Jan. 9. A surge in institutional buying came in 2012 among homebuilding stocks. But last year, Wall Street moved on and real estate underperformed every sector in the S&P; 500 except for basic materials, rising just 6 percent for the year through Jan. 10, according to Morningstar. This year could be different if the economy continues to create more jobs and spur long-term demand for all kinds of real estate, from single-family homes to commercial storage units. The most recent Case-Shiller Home Price index report showed U.S. home prices posting their strongest annualized gain in seven years. There’s still much pent-up demand for homes and commercial properties. With mortgage rates expected to remain relatively low, the real estate sector still has some promise. Exchange-traded funds that invest in real estate investment trusts are a worthy consideration, especially if you are looking for extra yield. Consider the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF, which holds developers and property managers like Simon Property Group Inc, American Tower Corp and Public Storage . The fund was up only 1 percent last year, but yields nearly 4 percent. It charges 0.46 percent for annual expenses. The materials sector was the most unloved group among the Standard & Poor’s industry sectors last year, gaining less than 3 percent for the year through Jan. 10.  A highly-cyclical basket of metals, chemical, mining and paper stocks, this cadre tends to do best during mature economic cycles. But laggards can become leaders if U.S. economic growth - pegged at more than four percent in the 3rd quarter - continues. The Materials Select Sector SPDR owns stocks like Monsanto, Dow Chemical Co and Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold. The SPDR charges 0.18 percent for annual management expenses and outperformed the materials sector as a whole, gaining 26 percent last year. Energy was another lackluster sector last year, returning a modest 10 percent for the year ending Jan. 10, compared to the best-performing technology group, which gained 56 percent. Improving demand for energy globally bodes well for companies that produce oil and natural gas, though. The Vanguard Energy ETF owns leading producers and service companies such as ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp  and Schlumberger NV. The fund charges 0.14 percent for annual expenses and returned 26 percent last year. Companies that produce or distribute power, natural gas and water seldom light up any investor’s radar screen during bull rallies. These high-dividend companies only become alluring when investors retreat from the most popular sector of the moment or there’s widespread uncertainty. Since the bull rally will fizzle at some point, it’s always good to have a fallback. Utilities fit that bill. Although these companies were firmly in the bottom tier last year, they could rebound if the market runs into trouble. Consider an ETF such as the iShares U.S. Utilities, which holds blue chips such as Duke Energy Corp, Dominion Resources and Exelon Corp. The fund returned almost 15 percent last year and yields about 3 percent with a 0.46 percent annual expense ratio. Feeling skittish about picking a lackluster U.S. sector and hoping it rebounds? A wiser choice would be to spread your portfolio among every sector through a broad-based world stock fund such as the iShares MSCI ACWI Index ETF, which holds the biggest stocks from around the world such as Apple , Nestle SA and General Electric Co. The fund rose 22 percent last year and charges 0.34 percent for annual expenses.

82,SPG,Fitch Upgrades Simon Property Group's IDR to 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the following credit  ratings for Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) and Simon Property Group,  L.P. (collectively, Simon): Simon Property Group, Inc.  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A' from 'A-'; --$75 million preferred stock to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. Simon Property Group, L.P.  --IDR to 'A' from 'A-'; --$6 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities to 'A' from 'A-'; --$14 billion senior unsecured notes to 'A' from 'A-'. In addition, Fitch has assigned a rating of 'A' to Simon Property Group, L.P.'s  $300 million unsecured term loan due 2018, $600 million 2.2% notes due 2019, and  $600 million 3.75% notes due 2024.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade to 'A' has two elements: first, improvements in the quality of the  company's retail real estate portfolio and second, improved liquidity. Pro forma  for the spinoff of the strip center business and smaller enclosed malls to  Washington Prime Group, Inc. (the spinoff) in 2Q'2014, fixed-charge coverage is  appropriate for the 'A' rating level.  The company has robust pro forma  liquidity coverage, driven in part by a low expected adjusted funds from  operations (AFFO) payout ratio.  This enables Simon to build unrestricted cash,  enhancing the company's ability to fund future investments and/or repay  unsecured debt as needed.   Credit strengths include Simon's excellent access to capital and management  track record as a capital allocator (e.g. via operations, development and  capital recycling).  Leverage is somewhat elevated for the 'A' level but  expected to decline over the next 12-to-24 months.   Spinoff Improves Asset Quality In December 2013, Simon announced the spinoff of its strip center business and  its smaller enclosed malls (each of the malls generated annual net operating  income (NOI) of approximately $10 million or less).  The spinoff entity,  Washington Prime Group, Inc. (WPG) will hold 54 strip centers and 44 mall  properties, and the spinoff is expected to occur in 2Q'2014.  The transaction  should improve SPG's asset quality as evidenced by higher mall occupancy (96.5%  pro forma compared with 96.1% at year-end) and higher tenant sales per square  foot ($616 pro forma compared with $582 at year-end).   The company's mall portfolio pro forma for the spinoff will include 178 mall  properties, 13 The Mills properties and 62 community/lifestyle centers.  Fitch  considers the portfolio 'prime' as it includes productive assets such as Forum  Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of Prussia  Mall in King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL.  Simon has  consistently outperformed its U.S. mall peers as measured by occupancy 60 basis  points (bps) above peers and same-store NOI 150 bps above peers from 2006 to  2013, evidencing 'prime' asset quality. Improving Fixed-Charge Coverage The company's same-store NOI growth, driven by mid-single-digit releasing  spreads and occupancy gains, along with a reduced cost of debt capital, improved  fixed-charge coverage to 3.1x in 2013 (3.2x in 4Q'2013) from 2.9x in both 2012  and 2011.  Releasing spreads averaged 14.9% in 2013 following 10.2% in 2012 and  9.5% in 2011.   Recently signed rents per square foot relative to 2014-2015 average expiring  rent per square foot indicate further upward momentum on releasing spreads pro  forma for the spinoff of WPG.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will  remain in the low-to-mid-3x range over the next 12-to-24 months, which is  consistent with an 'A' rating.  In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in  which the company's same-store NOI growth is consistent with 2009-2010 growth  (its weakest reported periods), fixed-charge coverage would remain in the low 3x  range, which would still be adequate for the 'A' rating.  Fitch defines  fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital expenditures  and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total interest incurred and  preferred stock dividends. Opportunistic Growth Fitch expects that the company will continue to seek out opportunities abroad,  augmenting an already diversified stream of cash flow from its U.S. portfolio.   The company recently expanded its international investment base beyond its 28.9%  equity stake in Klepierre SA and ownership interests in international Premium  Outlets, by acquiring interests in five operating properties in the U.K.,  Austria, Italy and the Netherlands through its joint venture with McArthurGlen.   Simon Property Group, L.P.'s Euro-denominated bond offering in October 2013  indicates the company's commitment to match-funding its European investments and  reducing currency risk.  Simon has been equally as opportunistic domestically.  In January 2014, Simon acquired its joint venture partners' remaining interest  in Kravco Simon Investments, a portfolio of 10 assets, including King of Prussia  Mall. Excellent Access to Capital The company has multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6 billion, aggregating  the largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector.  In addition to the abovementioned  Euro-denominated bond offering, in January 2014 Simon Property Group, L.P.  issued $600 million of 2.20% five-year senior notes and $600 million of 3.75%  10-year senior notes.  During 2013, the company also closed or locked rates on  30 new secured loans totaling approximately $5.1 billion, of which SPG's share  is $3 billion. The weighted average interest rate on the new loans is 3.31% and  the weighted average term is 7.5 years. Strong Liquidity  Liquidity coverage is solid at 1.8x for the period Jan. 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2015  pro forma.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by  liquidity uses.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under  revolving credit facilities, and projected retained cash flows from operating  activities pro forma for the repayment of the Sawgrass Mills mortgage, January  2014 unsecured bond offerings, and WPG spinoff.  Liquidity uses include pro  forma debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and development  expenditures.   If 90% of secured debt maturities through 2015 are refinanced, liquidity  coverage would improve to 2.6x.  In addition, near-term debt maturities are  manageable as approximately 5.7% of pro forma debt matures in 2014 followed by  10.5% in 2015, although 2016 pro forma debt maturities are somewhat heavy at  15.6%.   Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low (AFFO payout ratio, which was 59.2% in  2013.  Fitch calculates that the AFFO payout ratio will increase to 62.6% in  2014 pro forma for the spin-off of WPG, which should still provide strong  internally-generated liquidity of over $1.3 billion per year for future  investments and/or debt repayment. Strong Contingent Liquidity Supports IDR The company also has strong contingent liquidity from its unencumbered pool,  which now includes Sawgrass Mills, one of Simon's stronger assets.  Unencumbered  assets (pro forma Fitch-estimated unencumbered EBITDA divided by a stressed 7%  capitalization rate) covers net unsecured debt by 2.7x, which is adequate for an  'A' rating.  The company's unrestricted cash balance totaled $1.7 billion at  year-end 2013 and Fitch expects a minimum cash balance of approximately $1  billion to fund the business and/or repay corporate unsecured debt. Active Development Pipeline Simon's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost all segments including Premium Outlets.  This program should improve  asset quality going forward.  As of Dec. 31, 2013, the pipeline had a pro rata  net cost of approximately $1.3 billion and pro rata cost to complete of $853  million, representing 2.0% of gross assets, which is manageable especially  considering it can be largely funded via retained operating cash flow.  Cost to  complete is still below year-end 2007 levels of 2.3%. Leverage Expected to Decline Pro forma leverage is 5.5x compared with 5.2x in 4Q'2013 (5.6x for full year  2013).  The company reduced leverage from 6.0x in 2012 due to EBITDA growth  along with a build-up of cash via retained cash flow.  Fitch's base case  projects that leverage will approach 5x over the next 12 months and potentially  a high 4x by 2016 due to EBITDA growth, either of which would be appropriate for  the 'A' rating given SPG's improved asset quality.  Under Fitch's stress case,  leverage would remain around 5x, which would be weaker but adequate for an 'A'  rating. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between Simon's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'A'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site  at 'www.fitchratings.com', these preferred securities are deeply subordinated  and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in  the event of a corporate default. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's projection of leverage approaching 5.0x and  fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x over the near- to medium-term.  The  Stable Outlook further takes into account that the portfolio will remain 'prime'  quality and that qualitative credit strengths will include excellent access to  capital and a strong management team.  The company has sufficient liquidity to  fund its active development pipeline. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage was 3.2x in 4Q'2013); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (pro forma leverage is  5.5x though expected to trend just below 5.0x over the next 12-to-24 months). The following factors may have a negative impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x.

83,SPG,"Fitch Rates Simon Property Group, L.P.'s $1.3B Sr. Notes 'A'; Outlook Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned 'A' credit ratings to  the $900 million aggregate principal amount 3.375% coupon senior unsecured notes  due 2024 and $400 million aggregate principal amount 4.25% coupon senior  unsecured notes due 2044 issued by Simon Property Group, L.P., the operating  partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG, collectively, Simon).  The 2024 notes were priced at 99.804% of par to yield 3.398% to maturity, or 100  basis points over the benchmark treasury rate and the 2044 notes were priced at  99.409% of par to yield 4.285% to maturity, or 115 basis points over the  benchmark treasury rate. Simon intends to use the net proceeds of the offerings primarily to fund the  redemption of a series of outstanding notes of a subsidiary and the purchase of  any and all of five series of outstanding notes that are validly tendered upon  the terms and subject to the conditions in an offer to purchase dated September  3, 2014, and for general corporate purposes.  Fitch currently rates Simon as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock to 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --IDR 'A'; --$6 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan 'A'; --$14 billion senior unsecured notes 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'A' rating takes into account the strong quality of the company's retail  real estate portfolio, fixed-charge coverage appropriate for the 'A' rating  level, and robust pro forma liquidity coverage, driven in part by a low expected  adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio. Credit strengths also  include Simon's excellent access to capital and management track record as a  capital allocator (e.g. via operations, development and capital recycling).  Leverage is somewhat elevated for the 'A' level but expected to decline over the  next 12-to-24 months. Strong Asset Quality On May 28, 2014, Simon completed a spinoff of its strip center business and its  smaller enclosed malls (each of the malls generated annual net operating income  (NOI) of approximately $10 million or less) to Washington Prime Group, Inc.  (NYSE: WPG; Fitch IDR of 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook). Simon's portfolio as of  June 30, 2014 included ownership or interests in 228 properties, comprised on  181 U.S. malls and premium outlets, 13 The Mills properties, 20 international  premium outlets and designer outlets, among other investments. Fitch considers  the portfolio 'prime' as it includes productive assets such as Forum Shops at  Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of Prussia Mall in  King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL. Simon has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall peers as measured by occupancy 60 basis points (bps)  above peers and same-store NOI 150 bps above peers from 2006 to 2013, evidencing  'prime' asset quality. Improving Fixed-Charge Coverage The company's same-store NOI growth, driven by mid-single-digit releasing  spreads and occupancy gains, along with a reduced cost of debt capital, improved  fixed-charge coverage to 3.2x for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2014  (3.1x in 2Q'2014) from 2.9x in both 2012 and 2011. Releasing spreads were 20% in  2Q'2014 and 21.1% in 1Q'2014 after averaging 14.9% in 2013 and 10.2% in 2012.  Recently signed rents per square foot relative to average expiring rent per  square foot over the next several years indicate further upward momentum on  releasing spreads.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will remain in the low-to-mid-3x range  over the next 12-to-24 months, which is consistent with an 'A' rating. In a  stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which the company's same-store NOI  growth is consistent with 2009-2010 growth (its weakest reported periods),  fixed-charge coverage would remain in the low 3x range, which would still be  adequate for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities less recurring capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments,  divided by total interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  Opportunistic Growth Fitch expects that the company will continue to seek out opportunities abroad,  augmenting an already diversified stream of cash flow from its U.S. portfolio.  Over the past year, Simon expanded its international investment base beyond its  equity stake in Klepierre (28.9% as of June 30, 2014 and 19.3% pro forma for the  merger of Klepierre and Corio announced on July 29, 2014) and ownership  interests in international Premium Outlets, by acquiring interests in five  operating properties in the U.K., Austria, Italy and the Netherlands through its  joint venture with McArthurGlen. Simon Property Group, L.P.'s Euro-denominated  bond offering in October 2013 indicates the company's commitment to  match-funding its European investments and reducing currency risk. Simon has  been opportunistic domestically. In January 2014, Simon acquired its joint  venture partners' remaining interest in Kravco Simon Investments, a portfolio of  10 assets, including King of Prussia Mall. Excellent Access to Capital The company has multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6 billion comprised of  a $4 billion facility and $2 billion supplementary facility, aggregating the  largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector. In April 2014, the company amended and  extended the $4 billion facility and reduced the rate to LIBOR plus 80 basis  points from LIBOR plus 95 basis points. In addition to the abovementioned Euro  and Dollar denominated bond offerings, over the past year the company also  closed or locked rates on 30 new secured loans totaling approximately $5.1  billion, of which SPG's share is $3 billion. The company also retained $1  billion of cash proceeds from the debt placed on the WPG assets prior to the  spinoff. Adequate Liquidity Liquidity coverage is adequate at 1.2x for the period July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31,  2016 pro forma for the bond offerings and tender offers. Fitch defines liquidity  coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses. Liquidity sources  include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities, and  projected retained cash flows from operating activities pro forma for the WPG  spinoff. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring  capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt  maturities through 2016 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to  1.7x.  Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 66.4% in 2Q'2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013 and 57% in  2012. Fitch estimates that Simon generates approximately $1.2 billion in  internally-generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for future  investments, development and/or debt repayment. Strong Contingent Liquidity Supports IDR The company also has strong contingent liquidity from its unencumbered pool.  Unencumbered assets (Fitch-estimated unencumbered EBITDA divided by a stressed  7% capitalization rate) covers unsecured debt by 2.4x, which is adequate for an  'A' rating. The company's unrestricted cash balance totaled $1.7 billion at June  30, 2014 and Fitch expects a minimum cash balance of approximately $1 billion to  fund the business. Unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, net of readily  available cash, is 2.5x as of June 30, 2014.  Active Development Pipeline Simon's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost all segments including Premium Outlets. This program should improve asset  quality going forward. As of June 30, 2014, the pipeline had a pro rata net cost  of approximately $1.6 billion and pro rata cost to complete of $1.2 million,  representing 3.1% of gross assets, which is manageable especially considering it  can be largely funded via retained operating cash flow.  Leverage Expected to Decline Leverage as of June 30, 2014 was 5.6x compared with 5.6x for full year 2013. The  company reduced leverage from 6.0x in 2012 due to EBITDA growth along with a  build-up of cash via retained cash flow. Fitch's base case projects that  leverage will approach 5x over the next 12 months and potentially a high 4x by  2016 due to EBITDA growth, either of which would be appropriate for the 'A'  rating given SPG's improved asset quality. Under Fitch's stress case, leverage  would remain around 5x, which would be weaker but adequate for an 'A' rating.  Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between SPG's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis' Criteria Report dated Dec. 23, 2013, as  SPG's preferred securities have cumulative coupon deferral options exercisable  by SPG and thus have readily triggered loss absorption provisions in a going  concern. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's projection of leverage approaching 5.0x and  fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x over the near to medium term. The  Stable Outlook further takes into account that the portfolio will remain 'prime'  quality, that the company will have sufficient liquidity to fund its active  development pipeline and that qualitative credit strengths will include  excellent access to capital and a strong management team. On June 19, 2014,  Simon announced that Andrew Juster will become Chief Financial Officer in early  2015, succeeding retiring CFO Stephen Sterrett. Mr. Juster has served as Simon's  Treasurer since 2000. Fitch does not expect a change in Simon's financial  policies as a result of this announcement.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage was 3.1x in 2Q'2014); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.6x  though expected to trend just below 5.0x over the next 12-to-24 months). The following factors may have a negative impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x.

84,SPG,Washington Prime to buy Glimcher Realty for $2.06 billion,"(Reuters) - Shopping center operator Washington Prime Group (WPG.N) will buy smaller peer Glimcher Realty Trust GRT.N for about $2.06 billion, its biggest deal since being spun off from Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) in May. WPG said it offered $10.40 in cash and 0.1989 in stock for each Glimcher share, totaling about $14.20 per share, based on the ten day volume weighted average price of WPG’s stock.

86,SPG,"Fitch Rates Simon Property Group, L.P.'s CP Program 'F1'; Outlook Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a short-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'F1' to Simon Property Group, L.P., the operating  partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG or the company).  In  addition, Fitch has assigned short-term ratings of 'F1' to Simon Property Group,  L.P. and Simon CP 2's $500 million commercial paper (CP) note program.  Simon  Property Group, L.P. and Simon CP 2 (together Simon Property Group) are the  issuers of the CP paper, which has a maximum term of 379 days for the U.S. notes  (USCP notes) and 183 days for the Euro notes (ECP notes).  Simon Property Group,  L.P. guarantees the obligations of Simon CP 2.    On Oct. 7, 2014 SPG announced that under its global unsecured CP note program,  Simon Property Group may issue unsecured CP notes denominated in U.S. dollars,  Euros, and other currencies up to a maximum amount of $500 million or the  non-U.S. equivalent.  The CP program has been utilized by both issuers, and the  CP notes rank pari passu with all of the operating partnership's other senior  unsecured indebtedness, all of which is rated 'A' by Fitch.   The time horizon of investment-grade short-term ratings does not explicitly  relate to the 13 months immediately following a given date.  Instead, it relates  to the continual liquidity profile of the rated entity that would be expected to  endure over the time horizon of the long-term IDR. Corporate CP issuers need sufficient liquidity reserves (including liquid  assets, committed bank facilities, or liquidity from a parent or third party) to  withstand two types of liquidity challenges: systemic risk and credit, or event  risk.  Fitch's initial view on the short-term IDR generally considers the  issuer's long-term ratings based on the mapping in the Rating Correspondence  Table in Fitch's 'Short-Term Ratings Criteria for Non-Financial Corporates,'  dated Aug. 5, 2013.  In this table, a long-term IDR of 'A' corresponds with a  short-term IDR of 'F1'. The global unsecured CP note program is a credit positive in that it establishes  another source of unsecured debt capital -- albeit not a committed long-term  source -- for the company and may allow for borrowing arbitrage opportunities.  As of June 30, 2014, the company's $4 billion credit facility, which has an  initial maturity of June 30, 2018, bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.8%.  The company's $2 billion supplemental credit facility, which has an initial  maturity of June 30, 2016, bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.95%.  Conversely, recent U.S. CP rates for comparably rated issuers are 0.21% for 3  months and 0.24% for nine months and Euro CP rates for comparably rated issuers  range from 0.22% (three months) to 0.52% (nine months).  KEY RATING DRIVERS SPG's long-term IDR of 'A' takes into account the strong quality of the  company's retail real estate portfolio, fixed charge coverage appropriate for  the 'A' rating level, and robust pro forma liquidity coverage, driven in part by  a low expected adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio. Credit  strengths also include SPG's excellent access to capital and management track  record as a capital allocator (e.g. via operations, development and capital  recycling). Leverage is somewhat elevated for the 'A' level but expected to  decline over the next 12-to-24 months.  Strong Asset Quality On May 28, 2014, SPG completed a spinoff of its strip center business and its  smaller enclosed malls (each of the malls generated annual net operating income   of approximately $10 million or less) to Washington Prime Group, Inc.  (NYSE: WPG; Fitch IDR of 'BBB-'; Stable Outlook). SPG's portfolio as of June 30,  2014 included ownership or interests in 228 properties, consisting of 181 U.S.  malls and premium outlets, 13 The Mills properties, and 20 international premium  outlets and designer outlets, among other investments. Fitch considers the  portfolio 'prime' as it includes productive assets such as Forum Shops at  Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of Prussia Mall in  King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL. SPG has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall peers as measured by occupancy 60 basis points (bps)  above peers and same-store NOI 150 bps above peers from 2006 to 2013, evidencing  'prime' asset quality.  Improving Fixed-Charge Coverage The company's same-store NOI growth, driven by mid-single-digit releasing  spreads and occupancy gains, along with a reduced cost of debt capital, improved  fixed-charge coverage to 3.2x for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2014  (3.1x in 2Q'14) from 2.9x in both 2012 and 2011. Releasing spreads were 20% in  2Q'14 and 21.1% in 1Q'14 after averaging 14.9% in 2013 and 10.2% in 2012.  Recently signed rents per square foot relative to average expiring rent per  square foot over the next several years indicate further upward momentum on  releasing spreads.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will remain in the low- to mid-3x  range over the next 12-to-24 months, which is consistent with an 'A' rating. In  a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which the company's same-store NOI  growth is consistent with 2009-2010 growth (its weakest reported periods),  fixed-charge coverage would remain in the low 3x range, which would still be  adequate for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities less recurring capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments,  divided by total interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  Opportunistic Growth Fitch expects that the company will continue to seek out opportunities abroad,  augmenting an already diversified stream of cash flow from its U.S. portfolio.  Over the past year, Simon expanded its international investment base beyond its  equity stake in Klepierre (28.9% as of June 30, 2014 and 19.3% pro forma for the  merger of Klepierre and Corio announced on July 29, 2014) and ownership  interests in international Premium Outlets, by acquiring interests in five  operating properties in the U.K., Austria, Italy and the Netherlands through its  joint venture with McArthurGlen. Simon Property Group, L.P.'s Euro-denominated  bond offering in October 2013 indicates the company's commitment to  match-funding its European investments and reducing currency risk.  SPG has been opportunistic domestically. In January 2014, the company acquired  its joint venture partners' remaining interest in Kravco Simon Investments, a  portfolio of 10 assets, including King of Prussia Mall.  Excellent Access to Capital In addition to the newly established CP program, the company has multicurrency  credit facilities totaling $6 billion comprising a $4 billion facility and $2  billion supplementary facility, aggregating the largest capacity in the U.S.  REIT sector. In April 2014, the company amended and extended the $4 billion  facility and reduced the rate to LIBOR plus 80 bps from LIBOR plus 95 bps. In  addition to the abovementioned Euro and U.S. dollar denominated bond offerings,  over the past year the company also closed or locked rates on 30 new secured  loans totaling approximately $5.1 billion, of which SPG's share is $3 billion.  The company also retained $1 billion of cash proceeds from the debt placed on  the WPG assets prior to the spinoff. Adequate Liquidity Liquidity coverage is adequate at 1.2x for the period July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31,  2016 pro forma both bond offerings and tender offers completed in September.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities pro  forma for the WPG spinoff. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities,  projected recurring capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of  secured debt maturities through 2016 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would  improve to 1.7x. Liquidity is enhanced by SPG's low AFFO payout ratio, which was 66.4% in 2Q'14  compared with 59.2% in 2013 and 57% in 2012. Fitch estimates that the company  generates approximately $1.2 billion in internally generated liquidity per year,  which can be deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Strong Contingent Liquidity Supports IDR The company also has strong contingent liquidity from its unencumbered pool.  Unencumbered assets (Fitch-estimated unencumbered EBITDA divided by a stressed  7% capitalization rate) covers unsecured debt by 2.4x, which is adequate for an  'A' rating. The company's unrestricted cash balance totaled $1.7 billion at June  30, 2014 and Fitch expects a minimum cash balance of approximately billion to  fund the business. Unencumbered assets-to-unsecured debt, net of readily  available cash, was 2.5x as of June 30, 2014. Active Development Pipeline SPG's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost segments including Premium Outlets. This program should improve asset  quality going forward. As of June 30, 2014, the pipeline had a pro rata net cost  of approximately $1.6 billion and projected cost to complete of $1.2 million,  representing 3.1% of gross assets, which is manageable especially considering it  can be largely funded via retained operating cash flow. Leverage Expected to Decline Leverage (net debt as of June 30, 2014 divided by TTM recurring operating  EBITDA) was 5.1x compared with 5.6x for full-year 2013. The company reduced  leverage from 6x in 2012 due to EBITDA growth along with a build-up of cash via  retained flow. Fitch's base case projects that leverage will remain around 5x  over the next 12 months and could decline below 5x by 2016 due to EBITDA growth,  either of which would be appropriate for the 'A' rating given SPG's improved  asset quality. Under Fitch's stress case, leverage would increase to between 5x  and 5.5x, which would be weaker but adequate for an 'A' rating. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between SPG's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis' criteria report dated Dec. 23, 2013, as  SPG's preferred securities have cumulative coupon deferral options exercisable  by SPG and thus have readily triggered loss absorption provisions in a going  concern.  Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's projection of leverage approaching 5x and  fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3x over the near- to medium-term. The  Stable Outlook further takes into account that the portfolio will remain 'prime'  quality, that the company will have sufficient liquidity to fund its active  development pipeline and that qualitative credit strengths will include  excellent access to capital and a strong management team. On June 19, 2014, SPG  announced that Andrew Juster would become Chief Financial Officer in early 2015,  succeeding retiring CFO Stephen Sterrett. Mr. Juster has served as Simon's  Treasurer since 2000. Fitch does not expect a change in the company's financial  policies as a result of this announcement. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage was 3.1x in 2Q'14); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.1x at  June 30, 2014). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x.

89,SPG,Fitch: Simon's Proposed Acquisition of Macerich Would Likely Have Negative Credit Implications,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 09 (Fitch) The proposal by Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:  SPG) to acquire The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC, Macerich) for $91.00 per share  in cash and SPG shares, if consummated as proposed, would likely have negative  credit implications for SPG according to Fitch Ratings.  The proposed  transaction would increase SPG's leverage materially above the 5.1x level as of  Dec. 31, 2014 while also lowering the company's unencumbered asset coverage of  unsecured debt.  If an agreement is reached, Fitch would review revised  transaction terms, if any, and the company's ratings and Outlook.  Currently,  the company's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A' with a Stable  Outlook.   PROPOSED TRANSACTION  On March 9, 2015, SPG announced a proposed transaction to acquire MAC for  approximately $22.4 billion, including the assumption of MAC's approximately  $6.4 billion of debt outstanding, including MAC's pro rata share of mortgage  debt from unconsolidated entities.  SPG also reached an agreement in principle  to sell certain Macerich assets to General Growth Properties, Inc. (NYSE: GGP,  Not Rated) in connection with the closing of the acquisition. The GGP sale would  not be a condition to closing the transaction.  The proposed agreement between  SPG and GGP removes a potential bidder for MAC, thereby increasing the  probability of SPG winning MAC. However, hostile public-to-public REIT  transactions oftentimes pose challenges to the bidder by the target.  POTENTIAL CREDIT IMPLICATIONS Credit concerns inherent in the proposed transaction include a weakening of the  balance sheet as measured by net debt-to-EBITDA. Fitch's expectation of leverage  sustaining above 5.5x would be one factor inconsistent with the 'A' IDR.   Moreover, the company's unencumbered assets (based on a stressed 7%  capitalization rate) to net unsecured debt ratio of 2.6x would weaken if the MAC  transaction closes as proposed.  If consummated, Fitch anticipates that SPG  would maintain adequate liquidity and excellent access to capital. The company's  liquidity coverage ratio is 1.4x for the period Jan. 31, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016,  driven by an industry-leading revolving credit facility capacity, which will  enable the company to fund upcoming debt maturities and capital expenditures,  along with $1.3 billion of expected development costs.  Moreover, SPG's adjusted  funds from operations payout ratio was 64% during 2014; based on the current  payout ratio, the company retains over $1 billion annually in organic cash flow.  Credit positives inherent in the proposed transaction include the potential to  acquire a high-quality mall portfolio as measured by MAC's strong sales per  square foot and occupancy ratios.  Nevertheless, SPG has outperformed MAC on  both measures, with SPG's sales per square foot at $619 as of Dec. 31, 2014  compared with $587 - both high levels compared to the mall industry at large.   SPG's occupancy in its U.S. malls and Premium Outlets was 97.1% as of Dec. 31,  2014 compared with MAC at 95.8%.   SPG's average same-store net operating income (NOI) has outperformed MAC by 110  basis points from 2008-2014, which speaks to Simon's stronger property level  performance, while SPG also has materially lower general and administrative  costs as a percentage of total revenues when compared with MAC.  Therefore, SPG  has the potential to drive above-average cash flow growth if the MAC transaction  is consummated.  In addition, the proposed transaction would increase SPG's  exposure to strong demographic regions in California (29% of MAC's expected 2015  pro rata NOI), New York (18.3%) and Arizona (17%). RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x. The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (this ratio  was 3.7x in 2014); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.1x at  Dec. 31, 2014). Fitch currently rates the companies as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --$6.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan 'A'; --$13.4 billion senior unsecured notes 'A'; --$409 million commercial paper notes 'F1'.

91,SPG,Mall owner Simon pushes rival Macerich to do a deal,"(Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) offered to buy Macerich Co (MAC.N) for $14.39 billion in a deal that would join the No. 1 and No. 3 U.S. shopping mall owners. The cash-and-stock offer follows multiple refusals by Macerich to discuss a possible deal, which has enterprise value of $22.4 billion including debt, Simon said on Monday. Macerich shares rose as much as 7 percent to an 8-year high of $92.43, brushing past Simon’s offer of $91 per share. Simon shares were flat at $180.61 in afternoon trading. A combination of Indianapolis-based Simon and Santa Monica, California-based Macerich could boost their ability to negotiate leases with store owners at a time when mall operators are experiencing a fall in traffic as consumers take to shopping online, which is more convenient and often cheaper. A deal would also help Simon, which has a market value of about $57 billion, expand in California and Arizona, where Macerich’s portfolio of about 53 shopping centers is concentrated. Simon, led by former investment banker David Simon, has been aggressive its takeover strategy. In 2010, the company tried to buy General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), now the No. 2 mall owner, with a $10 billion offer. Simon disclosed a 3.6 percent stake in Macerich in November, seen by many at the time as a precursor to a bid. Up to Friday’s close, Macerich’s stock had risen 17.7 percent since Simon disclosed its stake. The offer, which is at a premium of 4.9 percent to Macerich’s Friday close, will be 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in Simon common stock. “Considering the substantial benefits our offer provides, we are confident that, given the opportunity, Macerich’s shareholders would accept our proposal,” David Simon, Simon’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Macerich, led by co-founder Chairman and Chief Executive  Art Coppola, said it would review Simon’s proposal. The equity value of the deal is based on Macerich’s 158.16 million shares outstanding as of Feb. 20. Simon said it did not expect any legal hurdles to the proposed transaction, which would add to its funds from operations (FFO) immediately. The company said it had agreed to sell selected Macerich assets to General Growth Properties. BofA Merrill Lynch is the financial adviser to Simon and Latham & Watkins, LLP is legal counsel.

94,SPG,Simon Property's bid for Macerich shows allure of upscale malls,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - People have been writing epitaphs for brick-and-mortar malls for years, but Simon Property Group Inc’s (SPG.N) unsolicited takeover bid for rival Macerich Co (MAC.N) shows there is still plenty of interest in the limited supply of upscale shopping centers. Simon, the largest U.S. mall owner, offered on Monday to buy Macerich for $14.39 billion after the Santa Monica, California-based real estate investment trust had refused multiple times to discuss a deal. Macerich stock fell slightly on Tuesday to $92.39 but still exceeded Simon’s $91-a-share offer, a sign investors believe the bid can be sweetened.  Simon, which published a presentation on Tuesday that it said showed why its proposal was compelling, declined to comment when asked about the appeal of high-end malls. Investors see upscale malls as irreplaceable assets with high barriers to entry, according to real estate research firm Green Street Advisors of Newport Beach, California.  Sales are declining in lower-income malls, but increasing in higher-income centers that count Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O and Uniqlo as tenants, with Bloomingdale’s (M.N) or Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) as anchors. Occupancy and rents are also rising for the toniest, best-located shopping centers. Lack of new supply is the silver lining for solid “A mall” fundamentals, Green Street said. “We are overmalled in the U.S., there’s no doubt about it,” said Green Street senior analyst Daniel Busch. “But the ones that will close are going to only further fortify the surviving malls in their respective markets.” Online shopping has hurt sales at strip malls and other neighborhood stores, but high-end retailers are striving to appeal to consumers, helping malls that cater to the affluent withstand the surge in e-commerce, analysts said. The changing store and restaurant landscape, including an increase in non-traditional tenants like gyms or supermarkets at the high-end malls, has kept sales per square feet, a closely watched industry metric, growing in contrast to a decline in strip malls. More than 85 percent of Macerich’s net operating income comes from “super zip codes,” the most prosperous U.S. areas. In these zones, the median household income is $120,000, and 70 percent of adults living there have college degrees, the company said in December, citing author Charles Murray. The focus on the top-income malls led Macerich to sell 15 properties between May 2013 and the end of last year whose net operating income declined 0.8 percent in the eight years ended December 2013. However, net operating income annually grew on average about 4.0 percent over the same eight-year period for Macerich’s “top 40 centers,” the company said in the December report. “A class” malls are a fortress because of the cost of building new centers, scarcity of land in desirable locations and their appeal as a destination, said Ken Riggs, president of Situs RERC, which does valuations of commercial real estate.

96,SPG,"UPDATE 4-Macerich rejects Simon Property offer, adopts poison pill","* Macerich says offer “substantially undervalues” company * Sets poison pill trigger at 10 pct * Changes board structure * Shares fall as much as 5 pct   (Adds Breakingviews link, updates stock prices) By Sagarika Jaisinghani March 17 (Reuters) - Macerich Co, the third-largest U.S. shopping mall owner, rejected a $14.39 billion unsolicited offer from larger rival Simon Property Group Inc, saying the proposal “substantially undervalues” the company. Macerich also said on Tuesday it adopted a poison pill, or a shareholder rights plan, with a 10 percent trigger and changed its board structure to thwart a hostile takeover. Shares of Macerich, which received the $91 per share offer earlier this month, fell as much as 5 percent to $90.29 in early trading. Including debt, the offer was valued at $22.4 billion. “Macerich’s rejection is based on a rosy view of its future prospects,” Simon Property Chief Executive David Simon said in a statement, calling the rejection an “extreme, scorched-earth response”. Macerich’s directors will now be divided into three classes and their term will be three years, the company said, adding that it would review this structure in 2016. Macerich is incorporated in Maryland, which allows a company’s board to take steps to ward off a hostile takeover without having to seek shareholder approval. The company said it rejected the offer partly due to antitrust concerns and its inability to evaluate Simon Property’s “claims regarding its margins.” “Simon’s next step is likely to be to raise its offer,” Cowen & Company analyst James Sullivan wrote in a note. Macerich has been selling off underperforming malls to focus on redeveloping its more lucrative malls. It plans to spend $400 million-$500 million annually on such actions over the next five years. The deal would have helped Simon Property boost its portfolio of high-end malls, which are performing better than those with mid-range brands, and expand in California and other western states. High-end malls generally house expensive brands such as Apple Inc and Macy Inc’s Bloomingdale’s. Macerich said its rights plan, which came into effect immediately, would expire on the date of its 2016 annual investor meeting. Shareholders of record as on March 30 will have the right to buy one preferred share for each common share held. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Goldman Sachs & Co and JP Morgan Securities LLC are Macerich’s financial advisers, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Goodwin Procter LLP and Venable LLP are its legal advisers. Macerich’s shares closed down 3.5 percent at $91.60 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Simon Property fell 0.5 percent to $186.13.

99,SPG,Macerich moves make Simon Property takeover bid tougher,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Whether a ploy to drive bidding higher or an effective roadblock, Macerich Co.’s (MAC.N) moves this week to ward off Simon Property Group Inc’s (SPG.N) $14.39 billion hostile takeover gives the target company a stronger defense against a formidable adversary. Macerich’s adoption of a staggered board and a poison pill, announced on Tuesday, makes Simon Property’s bid to take over the third-largest U.S. shopping mall owner more difficult. The poison pill will grant shareholders the right to buy Macerich shares at half their market value if any person or group acquires 10 percent or more of the company. Staggered boards are also considered a powerful anti-takeover defense. With Macerich’s moves, management has greater control over the real estate investment trust, making it tough for Simon Property to force a resolution, analysts say. “Unless Macerich wants to do a deal, there won’t be a deal,” said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill + Partners LP in New York. Historically, hostile takeovers of REITs are very difficult, he said. Macerich’s stock price suggests traders expect a sweetened bid. Shares hit a high of $94.18 on Thursday, up 3.5 percent from the offer price of $91 a share. The stock has climbed 35 percent since the day before Nov. 19, when Simon Property announced it had accumulated a 3.6 percent stake in Macerich. The governance changes Macerich implemented this week aim to give it more breathing room when it comes to assessing its options, the company’s board said on Tuesday. The anti-takeover measures are not as unfriendly to shareholders as they may seem, Todd Thomas, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a note, adding that the company could hold out for a higher offer. Simon Property’s chairman and chief executive, David Simon,  is considered a savvy foe. Investors give Simon credit for being disciplined in pursuing acquisitions that make sense, while dropping a deal that is not valuable, said Paul Adornato, senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York. For example, Simon Property withdrew a $4.5 billion offer for the UK’s Capital Shopping Centers in 2011 when the company refused to share information. “David Simon has shown discipline over the years in walking away when either the numbers don’t make sense or the deal is dead,” Adornato said. Sandler O’Neill’s Goldfarb said Simon Property’s offer of $91 a share is “pretty healthy,” though he recognized it could go higher. “Obviously people don’t lead with their ‘best-and-final,’ but the number that they’ve put out on our valuation is close to our forecast,” Goldfarb said. If Simon Property’s offer were to rise to $115 a share, it would drive a real estate measure known as the “cap rate” down to 4.0 percent, a high price but not too high, Adornato said. A cap rate is determined by dividing a property’s net operating income with an asset’s price. Falling cap rates indicate rising values.  “While that might seem excessive, one has to keep in mind there’s a lot of growth that’s not yet in Macerich’s numbers,” Adornato said, referring to Macerich’s acquisition of New York properties Kings Plaza in Brooklyn and Green Acres on Long Island, where a turnaround strategy has just begun.

Simon Property raised its cash-and-stock offer for Macerich on Friday to $95.50 per share from $91.00, and said it would withdraw the offer, valued at $23.2 billion, if Macerich did not meet with the company by April 1. Macerich shares fell 8.4 percent in early trading, suggesting that investors doubt the deal would go through, given the company’s strong defensive actions this week, including a change in its board structure. “I guess people are saying Macerich won’t bite,” Sandler O’Neill & Partners analyst Alexander Goldfarb said. “Macerich’s history has been very independent and marching to their own beat and I don’t know if this is enough to compel them.” The new offer values Macerich at $15.10 billion, based on 158.16 million shares outstanding as of Feb. 20. Simon Property said it would not nominate directors to Macerich’s board “or otherwise prolong this process.” The company said all other terms of its offer were unchanged, including a ratio of 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in Simon Property common stock. Macerich said it would review the new offer. “The ‘this is the best and final offer’ wording is never going to be viewed favorably by the market,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Ki Bin Kim said. Simon Property had disclosed a 3.6 percent stake in Macerich in November, seen by many at the time as a precursor to a bid. Macerich had said the earlier offer “undervalued” the company. Simon Property, however, has maintained that its offer was higher than the $71 per share deal that Macerich struck with Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan in November for a sale of 10.9 percent stake in return for full ownership of a joint venture. Macerich said on Thursday that the November deal was not representative of its value. “We believe this type of ‘apples and oranges’ comparison is just a tactic Simon is employing as part of its effort to force the sale of Macerich at the lowest possible price,” Macerich told Reuters. Macerich shares were down 7 percent at $87, giving up nearly all the gains made since March 6, a day before Simon Property made its first offer.

104,SPG,Simon's failed bid suggests REIT values still at a discount,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc’s (SPG.N) failed bid to buy U.S. upscale shopping center operator Macerich Co (MAC.N) is unlikely to crush either company’s stock price for a simple reason: No one is building any more “Class A” malls. Macerich late on Tuesday rejected Simon’s sweetened cash-and-stock offer, which was valued at $95.50 a share, or $23.2 billion including debt.  Macerich Chief Executive Officer Arthur Coppola said in a statement that the revised bid did not reflect the full value of the company, the third-largest U.S. real estate investment trust.  Analysts suggested Coppola had a point because upscale malls such as Macerich’s Tysons Corner Center in northern Virginia are unique assets that cannot be built as easily as hotels, apartment or office buildings. Simon’s bid and Macerich’s rejection underpin the value of Class A malls, said Cowen and Co analyst James Sullivan.  “They only get sold when a seller chooses to sell them,” he said. “Mall development just isn’t happening today. That makes the ones that are in place increasingly valuable.”  The uniqueness of upscale malls gives them “fortress-like” characteristics, as Sullivan and other REIT analysts point out. “As we say in the real estate business, malls are not fungible,” Sullivan said. “You can’t just turn around and build another one in the same market.” The only U.S. regional mall under construction is the International Market Place in Hawaii, a property controlled by Taubman Centers Inc (TCO.N). Macerich shares were down 5.9 percent at $79.34 in afternoon trading, while Simon rose 1.3 percent to $198.24.  Upscale mall valuations are generally the highest in the real estate industry, but their operators’ shares still trade at a discount to the individual assets, Sullivan said. General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), the second-largest U.S. REIT behind Simon, sold a stake in its Ala Moana shopping center in Hawaii to Australian pension fund AustralianSuper in March at a 3.7 cap rate, Sullivan said. A cap rate is the net operating income of a property divided by its price. The lower this measure is, the higher the asset’s price.  While Sullivan said Ala Moana was an exceptional asset, its cap rate suggested the better mall REITs have lower values than what their assets are selling for in the private market. To reflect a 4.0 cap rate, Macerich shares would have to rise to $115 from about $80 today, according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Paul Adornato. He said in an interview two weeks ago that Simon’s first bid of $91 a share on March 9 equated to a 4.8 cap rate. Sandler O’Neil + Partners analyst Alex Goldfarb said Simon CEO David Simon would not let Macerich’s rejection of his bid discourage him. The company has bid for and was rejected by Taubman Centers and General Growth in the past. Sandler O’Neil said it expected to receive or intended to seek compensation from both Macerich and Simon for investment banking services in the next three months.  “David is extremely shrewd and has run an incredible company,” Goldfarb said. “They’ll certainly find other investment opportunities.”  ",4012015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-macerich-m-a-mallvalues/simons-failed-bid-suggests-reit-values-still-at-a-discount-idUSKBN0MS56320150401

106,SPG,Simon Property ends pursuit of Macerich,"(Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc scrapped its attempt to buy Macerich Co, ending what could have been the largest deal between U.S. shopping mall operators after Macerich rejected its sweetened offer of $23.2 billion including debt. Macerich shares fell 5.5 percent to $79.67 on Wednesday, below what they were trading at before Simon Property made its first offer of $91 per share in March, suggesting Macerich faces an uphill task of convincing investors it did the right thing by walking away. Macerich’s management will have to dramatically step up performance to pacify investors, analysts said, calling its targets ambitious and unconvincing. Macerich said it would continue to sell its lower growth properties and set a target to increase operating margins by 4 percent over the next 18-24 months. “We wonder why these initiatives were not adopted prior to Simon Property’s takeover attempt,” Evercore Partners analyst Steve Sakwa said. Simon Property, the largest U.S. shopping mall owner, raised its offer last month to what it called its “best and final offer” of $95.50 per share.  “What did Macerich have to lose by, at the very least, talking to Simon Property to determine what was the true ‘best and final offer’?” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Nathan Isbee said. Simon Property, led by former investment banker David Simon, has been aggressive in its takeover strategy. In 2010, the company tried to buy General Growth Properties Inc, now the No. 2 mall owner, with a $10 billion offer. A combination with Macerich would have boosted Simon Property’s high-end mall portfolio and allowed it to negotiate better leases at a time when consumers are increasingly shopping online. “Simon could decide to re-focus on its market share in Europe and perhaps consider increasing its stake in Klepierre, given weakness in the Euro and very favorable long term financing,” Cowen & Company analyst James Sullivan said.

Simon Property, the largest U.S. shopping mall owner, raised its offer last month to what it called its “best and final offer” of $95.50 per share. “What did Macerich have to lose by, at the very least, talking to Simon Property to determine what was the true ‘best and final offer’?” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Nathan Isbee said. Simon Property, led by former investment banker David Simon, has been aggressive in its takeover strategy. In 2010, the company tried to buy General Growth Properties Inc, now the No. 2 mall owner, with a $10 billion offer. A combination with Macerich would have boosted Simon Property’s high-end mall portfolio and allowed it to negotiate better leases at a time when consumers are increasingly shopping online. “Simon could decide to re-focus on its market share in Europe and perhaps consider increasing its stake in Klepierre, given weakness in the Euro and very favorable long term financing,” Cowen & Company analyst James Sullivan said. Simon Property partly owns French shopping mall operator Klepierre. Simon Property’s shares were up 1.2 percent at $198.04.

109,SPG,Simon Property withdraws offer to buy Macerich,"April 1 (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc  scrapped its attempt to buy Macerich Co after the smaller shopping mall owner rejected its sweetened offer of $23.2 billion including debt. Macerich shares fell 5 percent to $80 in premarket trading on Wednesday. Simon Property raised its offer for Macerich last month to $95.50 per share from $91.00. “Our Board carefully reviewed Simon Property Group’s revised proposal and concluded that it does not reflect the full value of our company,” Macerich Chief Executive Arthur Coppola said in a statement. Macerich said it would continue to sell its lower growth properties and set a target to increase operating margins by 4 percent over the next 18-24 months. “Macerich’s stated determination to boost its operating margins in the near term seems an ambitious target and raises the question as to why this was not done sooner,” Cowen & Company analyst James Sullivan wrote in a note. Macerich shares were down at $79.99 in premarket trading. Up to Tuesday’s close of $84.33, they had fallen 11 percent since March 16, a day before the company rejected Simon Property’s first offer.

113,SPG,Value in new Sears JV with Simon is redevelopment of mall space,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With Sears Holdings Corp’s second joint venture announcement this month on Monday, one question left to be answered is how much of the struggling mall anchor’s property will be devoted to new, and potentially lucrative, retail space. Sears and Simon Property Group Inc said they would form a 50-50 joint venture to boost the value of 10 Sears properties at Simon-managed malls, similar to its April 1 announcement with mall operator General Growth Properties. As part of the agreement, up to half of the space Sears sold will be available for redevelopment for new tenants who will pay higher rents. The deal is part of the retailer’s effort to get value out of its extensive land holdings.  “The way they struck that deal made a lot of sense to us,” Daniel Busch, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, California. “Sears can work with these partners, with the mall landlords, to come up with a better use for their space.” The retailer has been trying to shore up its finances after posting losses in the last four fiscal years.  The option to redevelop parts of the Sears footprint in the malls was a major driver of why General Growth and Simon Property agreed to the joint ventures, Busch said. Sears does not need as much space as it has and it can capitalize on  releasing space, he said.  The Sears properties sold in the joint ventures is considered A Class because of their location, the quality of tenants and little, if any, vacancy. Sears obtained $114 million from Simon Property in exchange for its 50 percent interest.  Two weeks ago it received $165 million from GGP for its sale of 12 mall locations, part of wider Sears plans to raise $2.5 billion in a real estate investment trust to be called Seritage Growth Properties.  Sears shareholders will have the right to buy shares of the Seritage offering, which is expected to buy and lease back 254 Sears and Kmart stores when it closes at the end of the second quarter. Plans to form a REIT were first floated in November. The GGP transaction suggested Sears is more motivated to sell off assets. Busch said both GGP and Simon Property probably cherry-picked Sears holdings, however, leaving the question of how much value is left in the remaining properties.

116,SPG,Fitch Affirms Simon Property Group's L-T IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on Simon  Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) and certain rated subsidiaries (collectively,  Simon), including SPG's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation of Simon's long-term IDR at 'A' reflects the strong quality  of the company's retail real estate portfolio that generates robust cash flow in  excess of fixed charges, as well as the company's significant scale and  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders over the next two years relates to whether  Simon's recently established $2 billion common stock repurchase program and its  bid for The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC) reflect a more shareholder-friendly  capital allocation policy. The program, combined with the unsuccessful bid for  MAC, would have increased leverage by approximately a turn. However, the company  has reiterated a commitment to maintaining its existing ratings. Moreover, Simon  withdrew its bid for MAC and Fitch expects the company to repurchase a moderate  amount of common stock over the next two years.  Appropriate Leverage; Share Repurchase Program a Wildcard Fitch calculates Simon's leverage at 5.2x as of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma for the  cash acquisitions of Jersey Gardens in Elizabeth, New Jersey and University Park  Village in Fort Worth, Texas in January 2015. Fitch expects leverage to be in  the 5.0x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24 months but closer to 5.5x this year,  following the stabilization of development and re-development projects. Leverage  sustaining between 4.5x and 5.5x is appropriate for the 'A' rating, thus Fitch's  projections are towards the high-end of the range.  Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage would trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines leverage as debt less  readily available cash to recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated entities, which include dividends from  Klepierre.  Strong Asset Quality As of Dec. 31, 2014, Simon owned or had an interest in 228 properties comprising  189 million square feet in North America, Asia and Europe. Additionally, pro  forma for Klepierre SA's acquisition of Corio N.V., the company had an 18.3%  equity interest in Klepierre, a Paris-based shopping center company, and also  has an interest in a joint venture with McArthurGlen Group formed to own and  develop designer outlets primarily in Europe.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2014 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 150 basis points from 2005-2014, demonstrating  strong asset quality. Simon's 4Q2014 sales PSF was $619 ($631 for Simon's 109  malls), the second highest among the company's U.S. peers, trailing only Taubman  Centers, Inc. (unrated by Fitch) at $809.  Fitch considers SPG's portfolio as 'prime' as it includes productive assets such  as Forum Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of  Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL. The  portfolio has scale and diversity, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls.  Robust Fixed-Charge Coverage Simon's pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio is 3.9x, compared with 3.7x in  2014 and 3.3x in 2013. Mid-single-digit releasing spreads and occupancy gains  drove SPG's same-store NOI growth of 5.1% on comparable malls and Premium  Outlets in 2014. Releasing spreads for malls and Premium Outlets were 16.6% in  2014 compared with 18.2% in 2013 and 10.8% in 2012. This same-store NOI growth  and a reduced cost of debt capital improved fixed-charge coverage. Recently  signed rents per square foot relative to upcoming average expiring rent per  square foot indicate that strong re-leasing spreads are achievable for the next  several years. Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will be in low 4.0x range over the  next 12-to-24 months, which is strong for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines  fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital expenditures  and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total interest incurred and  preferred stock dividends. Lower Relative Overhead & Potential Operating Synergies Simon's general and administrative expenses as a percentage of recurring  operating EBITDA was 4.1% in 2014, indicative of its significant scale as the  largest publicly traded REIT. The company's equity market capitalization and  total market capitalization excluding limited partnership units were $56.6  billion and $83.7 billion, respectively, as of Dec. 31, 2014 ($66.3 billion and  $93.4 billion, respectively, including limited partnership units). Lower general  and administrative expenses and moderately lower capital costs (primarily via  unsecured bond and bank borrowings) have historically comprised the few scale  advantages available to REITs generally. Outside of the mall sector, not many  REIT property types have been able to generate meaningful property level savings  and/or operating synergies through increased scale. Market Leading Access to Capital In addition to a commercial paper (CP) program established in 2014--the first  such program established by a U.S. equity REIT?and upsized to $1 billion from  $500 million in March 2015, the company has two multicurrency credit facilities  totaling $6.75 billion. The credit facilities are comprised of a $4 billion  facility and $2.75 billion supplementary facility (upsized from $2 billion in  March 2015), aggregating the largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector.  Simon was active in both the unsecured and secured debt markets in 2014. It  retired $2.9 billion of senior notes at a weighted average coupon rate of 5.76%  and completed two senior notes offerings totaling $2.5 billion, with a weighted  average coupon rate of 3.32%. Simon also closed 16 new secured loans during 2014  totaling approximately $2.8 billion, of which SPG's share is $1.6 billion. The  weighted average interest rate on these loans is 3.29% and the weighted average  term is 8.4 years. Good Liquidity and Financial Flexibility Liquidity coverage is good at 1.3x for the period Jan. 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016  pro forma. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by  liquidity uses. Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under  revolving credit facilities pro forma for first quarter 2015 acquisitions, and  projected retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include  pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and  development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities through 2016 are  refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to 2.2x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 64% in 2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013 and 57% in 2012.  Fitch estimates that the company generates approximately $1.5 billion of  internally generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for future  investments, development and/or debt repayment. Fitch view's SPG's unencumbered pool as strong on an absolute basis given the  pool's size ($2.6 billion of EBITDA in 2014) and quality. Unencumbered assets  (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) covers net unsecured debt by 2.7x,  which is adequate for the rating. Fitch estimates that the unencumbered  portfolio is levered 5.6x as compared to the encumbered portfolio at 5.4x on a  gross basis and also excluding recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities, thus the unencumbered pool is slightly more levered than the  encumbered pool.  Active Development Pipeline Simon's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost all segments including Premium Outlets. This program should improve asset  quality going forward. As of Dec. 31, 2014, the pipeline had a pro rata net cost  of approximately $1.3 billion, representing 3.4% of gross assets, exceeding the  2.3% level reached at year-end 2007. However, redevelopment is a significantly  larger component of development expenditures today than it was then at 84%  compared to 37%. Redevelopments are lower risk due to smaller scale and  demonstrated leasing activity and sales history. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Simon in Fitch's base case include: --4% same-store NOI growth and 3%-3.5% same-store NOI growth in 2016-2017; --G&A; growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --$1-$1.5 billion in annual development funded predominately with retained cash  flow, generating 9% stabilized yields; --Stock repurchases of less than $500 million over the next two years; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds and secured debt; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 60%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.2x pro  forma for the acquisitions of Jersey Gardens and University Park Village). --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (this ratio  is 3.9x pro forma). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A deviation from SPG's public commitment to maintaining existing ratings  and/or any other actions that may result in a deterioration in the company's  market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock at 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --$6.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities at 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan at 'A'; --$13.4 billion senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --$409.2 million commercial paper notes at 'F1'. Simon CP 2 --$409.2 million commercial paper notes at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

117,SPG,Fund managers make big bet on high-end malls via Simon," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Even as the rise of online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc leads analysts to predict the eventual death of the American shopping mall, real estate fund managers are betting some will prosper – if they can lure the right kind of consumer.  Simon Property Group Inc, the largest high-end mall operator in the country with properties including Palo Alto, California’s Stanford Shopping Center and suburban Philadelphia’s King of Prussia Mall is the top holding in 53 of the 71 U.S. real estate funds tracked by Lipper. The average real estate fund devotes 8.8 percent of its portfolio to Simon, a bigger average bet than the 7.6 percent that tech funds invest in Apple Inc and almost one percentage point more than the weight of Simon in the benchmark S&P U.S. REIT index.  Still a symbol of a car-based, middle-class suburban America, malls are increasingly seen as viable only if they attract the affluent. Fund managers are bullish on so-called Class A malls, anchored by department stores like Bloomingdale’s and featuring retailers like Apple, reflecting how better-off consumers have thrived since the end of the financial crisis while middle and lower income consumers have struggled.  “Class A malls are repositioning themselves to be destinations, with more restaurants, which is making them more resilient to what’s going on with the Internet,” said Rick Romano, a portfolio manager of the $3.8 billion Prudential Global Real Estate fund, who holds 4.5 percent of his portfolio in Simon, his top holding.  Class A malls are also the only shopping centers able to attract an Apple store, which can post annual sales of more than $5,000 a square foot - the highest of any U.S. retailer - and boost sales growth for other retailers throughout the mall, Romano said. As a result, Simon has been able to post rent increases of 18.9 percent for new leases over the last 12 months, according to Paul Morgan, an analyst at MLV & Co.  Simon’s average rent per square foot – which includes ongoing and new leases – rose 4.5 percent in the first quarter compared with the year before, or about six times the 0.8 percent pace of inflation in the U.S. Bloomingdale’s is the most frequent anchor store at the highest-rated malls in the country, followed by Nordstrom.  Those Americans in the top 20 percent of income – or Class A mall shoppers – have seen their household assets jump from about $15 trillion in 2010 to $25 trillion in 2014, according to Green Street Advisors. Household assets for Class B and lower mall customers rose from about $7 trillion in 2010 to a little over $10 trillion in 2014.  Class B malls are often saddled with struggling department stores such as Sears or J.C. Penney as anchors, making them less attractive to prospective tenants. Some 24 such malls have closed since 2010, and an additional 60 are on the brink of closure, according to Green Street Advisors.  No REIT fund hold Class B or lower mall operators as their largest holding, according to Lipper. J.C Penney and Sears are the most frequent anchor stores at Class C and lower malls, according to Green Street.  There are about 1,000 enclosed shopping malls in the U.S. Foot traffic at malls during the November and December holiday shopping season fell from approximately 35 billion visits in 2010 to 17.6 billion in 2013, according to an October Cushman and Wakefield report. Online commerce now accounts for 15 percent of retail sales - just 5 percentage points less than the percentage of retail sales that come from malls and gaining, according to a report from Green Street Advisors.   DEMAND FOR HIGH-END RISING  Investor demand for high-end malls will rise even if consumer spending overall flattens or starts to slow, said Jason Ko, a co-portfolio manager of the $2.1 billion J.P. Morgan Realty Income fund who has 7.8 percent of his portfolio in Simon, his largest position.  Macerich Co, the third-largest mall owner in the U.S., rejected a $16.8 billion takeover offer from Simon Property on April 1, a merger that would give Simon an even larger hold of the high-end mall market. Simon is not expected to come back with a higher offer, analysts and fund managers said.  “What that attempt signifies is that high quality malls are irreplaceable: difficult to build and difficult to buy,” Ko said.  Shares of Simon Property are down 5.5 percent since Macerich rejected its takeover offer, while shares of Macerich have fallen 2.2 percent over the same time. Over the last 12 months, shares of Simon are up 5.7 percent, or about 2 percentage points less than the 7.9 percent gain in the benchmark index.  Simon shares closed Wednesday at $181.31, compared with the average target price of $217.05 among analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters. At that price, Simon is selling at 39 times trailing 12 month earnings, slightly below the average 45 times earnings among its peers, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Class B malls, meanwhile, will not only feel the effects of sales declines at J.C. Penney and Sears, but will see increased competition from so-called power centers - suburban developments that are often next to a major highway and include a Home Depot or Best Buy alongside a traditional strip mall, said Ian Goltra, who helps oversee $2 billion in real estate investments at San Francisco-based Forward Funds.  Goltra has several short positions for Class B mall operators in his funds, yet expects shares of Simon to rise, even with its high percentage of fund ownership. He has been adding shares of Simon as it has traded in the $180s, down from a high of $205.31 on Jan 28th.  “They have the largest portfolio of blue-chip tenants, and that’s something their competitors have not been able to replicate,” he said.

118,SPG,UPDATE 1-Macerich shares slump on talk Simon selling its stake,"(Updates volume data, adds reporting credit) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - Shares of mall operator Macerich Co fell as much as 7.3 percent on Friday on reports rival Simon Property Group Inc was selling a 3.6 percent stake, months after its failed takeover bid. Sources told Reuters that Simon Property, the largest U.S. mall operator, was selling 5.7 million shares of Macerich, the No. 3 U.S. mall operator. The shares had been offered in a range of $80.50 to $81 a share, lower than Macerich’s close of $82.45 a share on Thursday, sources said. Citigroup was in charge of the block trade, the sources said. Evercore reported the same on Thursday. Macerich declined to comment, and Simon Property did not immediately return a telephone call. Macerich shares were last down 6.2 percent at $76.80, after dropping to as low as $76.40 in early trading. Simon in March offered $95.50 a share for Macerich in a deal valued at $23.2 billion, but Macerich adopted a poison pill and its board unanimously rejected the offer at month’s end. On April 1 Simon withdrew its bid. More than 9 million shares of the stock changed hands on Friday, the company’s busiest trading day since March 20, when Simon made what it called its final offer for Macerich. Shareholders have questioned Macerich’s decision. At the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ annual REIT Week conference last week an unidentified person demanded to know how Macerich had decided to reject the takeover offer. Art Coppola, chairman and chief executive officer at Macerich, said after talking to investment bankers he did not name and Eastdil Secured, a well-known property brokerage, the board concluded Simon’s bid was “substantially inadequate.” Simon shares dipped 0.4 percent to $181.10.

121,SPG,"Investors dump U.S. stocks, seek bond safe haven-BAML","LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Investors dumped stocks and fled for the safety of bonds in the week to Jan. 6 which saw $2.3 trillion wiped off global equity markets and the worst opening week for the S&P; 500 index, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) said on Friday. Some $8.8 billion was pulled from equities, the largest outflow in 17 weeks, with the redemptions mainly concentrated in U.S. equity funds after the S&P; 500 lost 4.9 percent in the first four trading days of 2016. High quality government, municipal and investment grade bond funds were the big gainers, with some $3.3 billion of inflows. This was the highest in 11 weeks according to BAML’s data, which also includes numbers from Boston-based research house EPFR Global. Investors have taken fright at the huge volatility in equity markets in the first few trading days of 2016, with developed and emerging stock markets in freefall following turmoil in Chinese mainland markets and a sharp move lower in the yuan. More than 40 percent of the stocks in the benchmark S&P; 500 are now 20 percent or more off their highs, the definition of a bear market. BAML estimated the global market cap loss at $2.3 trillion over four days of selling. The benchmark emerging markets index has plummeted to 6-1/2-year lows, and is on course for a weekly loss of 6.5 percent, its worst weekly performance since May 2012. Investors pulled some $500 million from EM equity funds in the week to Jan. 6, the 10th straight week of outflows. But BAML said the panic selling had not extended across all equity funds, with Europe and Japan funds attracting a combined $2.2 billion of inflows. “Redemption pressures continue and are broadening too, but weekly flows do not indicate mass investor capitulation,” BAML said. Investors added $1.9 billion to investment grade bond funds, the largest inflows in five weeks, $900 million to government bond funds, and $1.1 billion to municipal bond funds, the biggest inflows in a year. There were also modest inflows of $400 million to emerging market debt funds - the second straight week of inflows after outflows in 21 of 22 weeks.

122,SPG,Fitch Rates Simon Property Group's Notes Offering 'A',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to $1.35  billion of senior unsecured notes issued by Simon Property Group, L.P, the  operating partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc.  The offering totalled $550 million of 2.5% senior unsecured due July 15, 2021  and $800 million of 3.3% senior unsecured notes due Jan. 15, 2026. The company  expects to use the net proceeds to retire three existing mortgage loans, to  redeem the 6.1% notes due 2016, to repay a portion of borrowings under their  unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. A full  list of ratings follows at the end of the release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Simon's 'A' long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the strong quality of  the company's retail real estate portfolio, the company's significant scale and  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders over the next two years relates to whether  Simon's recently established and partially utilized $2 billion common stock  repurchase program and its bid for The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC) reflect a  more shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. The program, combined with  the bid for MAC (should it have been successful), would have increased leverage  by approximately a turn. However, the company has reiterated a commitment to  maintaining its existing ratings. Moreover, Simon withdrew its bid for MAC, and  Fitch expects the company to repurchase a moderate amount of common stock over  the next two years. APPROPRIATE METRICS; SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM A WILDCARD Fitch calculates Simon's leverage at 5.3x as of Sept. 30, 2015 as compared to  5.2x as of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma for certain acquisitions. Fitch expects  leverage to be in the 5.0x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24 months but closer  to 5.5x this year, following the stabilization of development and re-development  projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x and 5.5x is appropriate for the 'A'  rating, and thus Fitch's projections are towards the high-end of the range. Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage would trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. Through 3Q15, SPG has repurchased $343  million though the effects on leverage were mitigated by the sale of $454  million of marketable and non-marketable securities (i.e. the MAC shares) in  2Q15. Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities, which include dividends from Klepierre.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will be in the low 4x over the next  12-to-24 months (4x in 3Q15 and 3.7x in 2014) driven by mid-single digit  releasing spreads. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating  EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring  capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total  interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets. The  portfolio has scale and diversity with interests in properties in North America,  Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch also views  SPG's 3Q15 $616 sales per square foot and outperformance relative to other mall  REITs (as measured by SSNOI) as further indications of the portfolios quality.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2014 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 150 basis points from 2005-2014, demonstrating  strong asset quality. MARKET LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL  Fitch views Simon as having the most consistent and durable access to capital in  the REIT sector, which is a material driver of the 'A' rating. The company  established a commercial paper (CP) program established in 2014 (the first such  program established by a U.S. equity REIT), which it upsized to $1 billion from  $500 million in March 2015. In addition to the CP program, Simon has two  multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6.75 billion. The credit facilities  are comprised of a $4 billion facility and $2.75 billion supplementary facility  (upsized from $2 billion in March 2015), aggregating the largest capacity in the  U.S. REIT sector. Moreover, Simon has traditionally been active in both the  unsecured and secured debt markets.  ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Liquidity coverage is 1.0x for the period Oct. 1, 2015 through Dec. 31, 2017 pro  forma for the notes issued in January 2016, the EUR denominated notes issued in  November 2015 and the redemption of the 6.125% and 7.375% notes due 2018. Fitch  defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities pro forma and projected retained cash flows from operating  activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring  capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt  maturities through 2017 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to  1.6x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 72.8% in 3Q15, 64% in 2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013  and 57% in 2012. Fitch estimates that the company generates approximately $1  billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for  future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Fitch view's SPG's unencumbered pool as strong on an absolute basis given the  pool's size ($2.6 billion of EBITDA in 2014) and quality. Unencumbered assets  (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) covers net unsecured debt by 2.9x,  which is adequate for the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Simon in Fitch's base case include: --4% same-store NOI growth and 3%-3.5% same-store NOI growth in 2016-2017; --G&A; growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --$1-$1.5 billion in annual development funded predominately with retained cash  flow, generating 9% stabilized yields; --Stock repurchases of less than $500 million cumulative over the next two  years; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds and secured debt; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 60%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.3x at  Sept. 30, 2015); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x  (fixed-charge coverage was 4x at Sept. 30, 2015). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A deviation from SPG's public commitment to maintaining existing ratings  and/or any other actions that may result in a deterioration in the company's  market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x. FULL LIST OF RATINGS: Fitch currently rates SPG as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Preferred stock 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facilities 'A'; --Senior unsecured term loan 'A'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A'; --CP notes 'F1'.

123,SPG,UPDATE 1-J.C. Penney looking at sale-leaseback deal for Texas HQ,"(Reuters) - Department store operator J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) said it is pursuing a potential sale and partial leaseback of its headquarters in Texas to reduce debt and costs.  J.C. Penney employs more than 3,000 workers at its Plano, Texas headquarters, which it has occupied since 1992.  The retail chain’s decision comes at a time when several U.S. department store operators are looking to create value from their vast real-estate holdings as their core business of selling clothes and home goods come under pressure. Hedge fund Starboard Value LP urged Macy’s Inc (M.N) last month to enter into joint ventures for its stores, including its flagship Herald Square store in New York, to realize greater value from its real estate assets. Struggling retailer Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) laid out plans in April last year to raise more than $2.5 billion by creating a real estate investment trust, Seritage Growth Properties (SRG.N), that would hold about 254 Sears and Kmart stores.     The company also entered into three joint ventures with mall operators, including Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) and Macerich Co (MAC.N), to sell some of its stores. J.C. Penney said on Friday the cost of leasing space would be offset by reducing maintenance costs, property taxes and lower interest expenses through paying down debt with proceeds from the sale. CBRE Group Inc’s CBG.N Capital Markets unit has been selected to find buyers for the 1.8 million-square-foot office campus located in Legacy Business Park in Plano. J.C. Penney had in 2014 decided to contribute a significant portion of the land surrounding its headquarters to a joint venture with a team of developers.

124,SPG,Investors shy away from U.S. stock mutual funds for second week: ICI,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock mutual funds based in the United States posted $2.1 billion in withdrawals last week for the second consecutive week, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on Wednesday, as U.S. equities broke a five-week winning streak. The stock funds posted outflows after attacks in Belgium weighed on investor sentiment. Returns were also held back by a stronger U.S. dollar and comments by U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers suggesting the potential for an April hike in benchmark interest rates.  U.S.-based mutual funds that invest mainly in companies based within the country posted $2 billion in outflows in the week that ended March 23. Outflows from international stock funds moderated to $108 million in the latest week, compared with $558 million the previous week, as investors took less money from emerging-markets funds. U.S.-based funds invested in those riskier markets posted just $79 million in outflows during the week, compared with $1 billion the previous week. Investors ended an 11-week streak of inflows that had brought a total $22 billion to funds invested in developed markets outside the United States, like Europe and Japan, during the week. Those funds posted $29 million in outflows, according to ICI. “Investors continued to favor bonds funds over equity funds, with municipal bonds and investment-grade taxable bonds dominating,” said Todd Rosenbluth, who directs mutual-fund research at S&P; Global Market Intelligence. “Within equities, the recent willingness to take on risk through small and mid-cap U.S. funds has disappeared, causing outflows.” Bond funds enjoyed another strong week, taking in $4.7 billion. Investment-grade bond funds attracted $1.6 billion, while lower-grade high-yield funds took in $420 million, ICI said. Prices on corporate debt have improved in recent weeks as fears that some energy companies would default abated and oil prices improved. Municipal-bond funds took in $1.6 billion, their 25th straight week of inflows. Investors added $683 million to taxable-government bond funds, the 15th straight week of net new cash for those safe-haven funds, according to ICI. The following table shows estimated ICI flows for the past five weeks (all figures in millions of dollars):                            3/23    3/16    3/9     3/2  2/24/2016                      Total equity  -2,144  -2,087  1,472      45      4,441                      -Domestic     -2,035  -1,528   -240  -2,189      2,090                      -World          -108    -558  1,712   2,234      2,350                      Hybrid         1,774     225  1,406     987      1,601                      Total bond     4,673   4,921  5,939   4,100        -99                      -Taxable       3,087   3,858  4,906   3,166     -1,120                      -Municipal     1,586   1,063  1,032     934      1,020                      Total          4,303   3,060  8,816   5,132      5,942           ",3302016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mutualfunds-ici/investors-shy-away-from-u-s-stock-mutual-funds-for-second-week-ici-idUSKCN0WW2H4

126,SPG,Teen retailer Pacific Sunwear files for bankruptcy,"(Reuters) - Teen apparel retailer Pacific Sunwear of California Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Thursday, succumbing to mounting losses and intense competition from fast-fashion retailers and online rivals. The company, which joins recent U.S. Chapter 11 filings by surfwear brand Quicksilver and teen retailer American Apparel, plans to be taken private by investment firm Golden Gate once it emerges from bankruptcy, it said in a statement on Thursday. Its shares fell to a record low of 5 cents on Thursday and were still down 42 percent at 5.5 cents in late afternoon. Citing “significant and unusual trading,” lawyers for the retailer asked a judge to restrict trading on Thursday due to concerns that a significant change in ownership could impair its ability to use tax benefits on operating losses down the road. Founded in 1982 as a surf shop, PacSun has posted an annual net loss since the financial crisis hit in 2008. It had about $342.7 million of net operating losses as of Jan. 31, which can be used to reduce tax liabilities if it becomes profitable again. “The company believes that this is an extremely valuable asset of the bankruptcy estate,” Joseph Barry of Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor said at an emergency hearing in Delaware on Thursday. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Silverstein approved the interim motion and holders of PacSun stock will be notified. Pacific Sunwear said Golden Gate plans to convert more than 65 percent of its debt into equity and provide a minimum of $20 million in additional capital. Golden Gate had lent PacSun about $60 million in 2011. The company also said it had a debtor-in-possession credit agreement of $100 million with Wells Fargo Bank. The Anaheim, California-based retailer listed assets in the range of $50 million to $100 million, and liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million, according to its court filing. It named Nike Inc and mall operator Simon Property Group Inc among its creditors, while top investors include investment firm GI2 Ltd with a 28.6 percent stake and Adage Capital Management LP with a 14.1 percent stake. PacSun said it would continue to operate all of its 600 stores and does not expect the bankruptcy filing to have an immediate impact on employees. Rival Aeropostale Inc said in March it was exploring strategic alternatives, including a sale, an option that sector experts said PacSun may also need to contemplate.

128,SPG,Fitch Rates Simon Property Group's EUR Notes Offering 'A',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to EUR500  million of 1.25% senior unsecured notes issued by Simon International Finance,  S.C.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG). The  notes are guaranteed by Simon Property Group LP. A full list of ratings follows  at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Simon's 'A' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the strong quality of  the company's retail real estate portfolio, its significant scale, and its  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders relates to whether Simon's partially  utilized $2 billion common stock repurchase program and its bid for The Macerich  Company (NYSE: MAC) last year reflect a more shareholder-friendly capital  allocation policy. However, the company has reiterated a commitment to  maintaining its existing ratings.  APPROPRIATE METRICS  Fitch calculates Simon's leverage was 5.4x and 5.5x for the trailing 12 months  (TTM) and quarter ended March 31, 2016 as compared to 5.2x and 5.1x for 2015 and  2014, respectively. Fitch expects leverage to be in the 5.0x-5.5x range over the  next 12-to-24 months but closer to 5.5x this year, following the stabilization  of development and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x and  5.5x is appropriate for the 'A' rating, and thus Fitch's projections are towards  the high-end of the range. Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage could trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. During 1Q16, SPG did not complete any  share repurchases but maintains $1.66 billion in capacity on its $2 billion  share repurchase program announced in April 2015 and authorized for a 24-month  period. When including 50% of preferred stock in total debt, SPG's leverage was  5.5x and 5.4x for the quarter and TTM ended March 31, 2016. Fitch defines  leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring operating EBITDA  including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated entities, which  include dividends from Klepierre.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the low 4x over the  next 12-to-24 months (4.3x and 4.1x for quarter and TTM ended March 31, 2016 and  4.1x in 2015) driven by mid-single digit releasing spreads. Fitch defines  fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including cash distributions  from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital expenditures and  straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total interest incurred and preferred  stock dividends. STRONG ASSET QUALITY Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets. The  portfolio has scale and diversity with interests in properties in North America,  Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch also views  SPG's 1Q16 $613 sales per square foot and outperformance relative to other mall  REITs (as measured by SSNOI) as further indications of the portfolios quality.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2015 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 100 basis points from 2005-2015. MARKET LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views Simon as having the most consistent and durable access to capital in  the REIT sector, which is a material driver of the 'A' rating. The company  established a commercial paper (CP) program in 2014 (the first such program  created by a U.S. equity REIT), which it upsized to $1 billion from $500 million  in March 2015. In addition to the CP program, Simon has two multicurrency credit  facilities totalling $7.5 billion. The credit facilities are comprised of a $4  billion facility and $3.5 billion supplementary facility (upsized from $2  billion in March 2015 with the accordion option exercised in April 2016),  aggregating the largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector. Moreover, Simon has  traditionally been active in both the unsecured and secured debt markets. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Liquidity coverage is 1.2x for the period April 1, 2016 through Dec. 31, 2017  pro forma for the EUR denominated notes issued in May 2016, the exercised  accordion option on the revolving line of credit and the closing of the  acquisition of The Shops at Crystals. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as  liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses. Liquidity sources include  unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata  debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and development  expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities through 2017 are refinanced,  liquidity coverage would improve to 1.8x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations  (AFFO) payout ratio, which was 64.5% in 1Q16 and 66.7% in 2015 compared with 64%  in 2014 and 59.2% in 2013. Fitch estimates that the company generates greater  than $1 billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be  deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Fitch view's SPG's unencumbered pool as strong on an absolute basis given the  pool's size ($3 billion of EBITDA in 2015) and quality. Unencumbered assets  (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) cover net unsecured debt by 2.8x,  which is adequate for the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Simon in Fitch's base case include: --4% same-store NOI growth and 3%-3.5% same-store NOI growth in 2016-2017; --G&A; growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --$1-$1.5 billion in annual development funded predominately with retained cash  flow, generating 9% stabilized yields; --Stock repurchases of less than $500 million cumulative over the next two  years; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds and secured debt; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 60%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.4x at  March 31, 2016); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x  (fixed-charge coverage was 4.1x at March 31, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A deviation from SPG's public commitment to maintaining existing ratings  and/or any other actions that may result in a deterioration in the company's  market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x.

129,SPG,Fitch Affirms Simon Property Group's IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Simon  Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) and the obligations of its subsidiaries  (detailed at the end of this release), including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS SPG's 'A' IDR reflects the company's high-quality retail real estate portfolio,  cycle-tested management team, its market-leading access to capital, and its  significant scale which influences efficiencies and the aforementioned access to  capital. Other strengths include its financial flexibility that stems from a low  dividend payout ratio and a sizable unencumbered pool. Partially offsetting  these strengths is leverage that is low on an absolute basis but high relative  to the rating sensitivities for the 'A' rating. Moreover, SPG is unspecific  about its financial policies and credit rating targets and has demonstrated a  willingness to flex the balance sheet for external growth opportunities.  LEVERAGE STABILIZING AT CURRENT LEVELS Fitch expects leverage will be in the 5x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24  months but closer to 5.5x for 2016, following the stabilization of development  and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x-5.5x is  appropriate for the 'A' rating and thus Fitch's projections are towards the  high-end of the range. These levels are largely unchanged from where SPG has  operated recently with leverage at 5.4x and 5.5x for the trailing 12 months  (TTM) and quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to 5.4x and 5.2x for full years  2015 and 2014.  Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities,  which includes dividends from its investment in Klepierre shares. Leverage when  including 50% of preferred stock and preferred units was 5.5x, 5.4x and 5.2x for  the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and the years 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the mid-to-high 4x  range over the next 12-to-24 months as compared to 4.1x for the TTM ended March  31, 2016. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA  including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital  expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments divided by total interest  incurred and preferred stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY DRIVING OPERATING PERFORMANCE Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets, which  has supported operating performance despite tenant headwinds and should be more  financeable on a relative basis. The portfolio has scale and diversity with  interests in properties in North America, Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium  Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch views SPG's 1Q16 $613 sales per square foot and  outperformance relative to other mall REITs (as measured by SSNOI growth) as  further indications of the portfolio's quality. Simon has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable NOI growth exceeding  peers by an average of 240 basis points (bps) from 2005-2015 and occupancy  outperforming peers by 100 bps from 2005-2015. SPG has sought to address secular tenant pressures by reducing exposure to  smaller and/or weaker assets through the Washington Prime Group spin-off and  reinvesting in its portfolio through expansion and redevelopment projects. Fitch  notes nonetheless that persistent tenant headwinds could affect the productivity  and financeability of SPG's portfolio. MARKET-LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views SPG as having sector-leading and durable access to capital, and its  relative and absolute access to debt capital are primary factors behind the 'A'  rating. Substantiating this view are the diversity of SPG's capital sources. SPG  has demonstrated access to debt capital in multiple currencies (USD and EUR),  across a wide range of tenors (commercial paper through 30-year notes) and at  all points in the cycle. SPG re-opened the REIT unsecured debt market in 2009  when it issued $650 million of 10-year notes at 10.4%.  SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY RELATIVE TO OBLIGATIONS SPG has appropriate financial flexibility considering the size of its  obligations. SPG's primary sources of liquidity are its unrestricted cash and  availability under the two revolving credit facilities totalling $7.5 billion  and the contingent liquidity in the unencumbered asset pool.  Liquidity coverage is consistent with the sector at 1.2x for the period April 1,  2016 through Dec. 31, 2017 pro forma for the EUR-denominated notes issued in May  2016, the exercised accordion option on the revolving line of credit and the  acquisition and financing of The Shops at Crystals. Liquidity sources include  unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata  debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and development  expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities through 2017 are refinanced,  liquidity coverage would improve to 1.9x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations  (AFFO) payout ratio, which was 64.5% in 1Q16 and 66.7% in 2015, compared with  64% in 2014 and 59.2% in 2013. Fitch estimates that the company generates  greater than $1 billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be  deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Unencumbered  assets (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) cover net unsecured debt by  2.7x, which is appropriate for the rating. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that SPG's operating fundamentals will  remain favorable over the next 12-to-24 months and that the issuer will maintain  leverage consistent with the 'A' rating. Beyond the rating horizon, Fitch  considers the mall's long-term competitive position as a key determinant of  SPG's operating fundamentals, the financeability of its assets and its overall  access to capital.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Operating fundamentals remain accommodative but decelerate modestly from  mid-single-digit SSNOI growth to reflect retailer headwinds; --SPG continues to match redevelopment and expansion capex to retained cash flow  from operations after dividends; --SPG maintains market-leading access to capital, refinancing all secured and  unsecured debt with like amounts but does not issue equity.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (TTM leverage was 5.4x  at March 31, 2016) --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (TTM  coverage was 4.1x at March 31, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Should SPG demonstrate or speak to more flexible financial policies that  result in a deterioration in the company's market-leading access to capital on  an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Should the competitive position of malls generally or SPG's portfolio  specifically deteriorate due to factors such as retailer headwinds or changing  distribution channels, resulting in weaker operating fundamentals and  financeability of SPG's portfolio;  --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 3x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Simon Property Group, Inc.  --Long-Term IDR at 'A'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB+'.  Simon Property Group, L.P.  --Long-Term IDR at 'A';  --Short-Term IDR at 'F1';  --Senior unsecured revolving credit facilities at 'A';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'A';  --CP notes at 'F1'.  Simon CP 2  --CP notes at 'F1'.  Simon International Finance, S.C.A.  --Unsecured guaranteed notes at 'A'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has affirmed and withdrawn the 'A' rating on term loans as a class of  obligations for Simon Property Group, L.P., as the obligation ($240 million  senior unsecured term loan) was repaid early.

136,SPG,Fitch Rates Simon Property Group's Notes Offering 'A',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to the  $1.85 billion multi-tranche senior notes issued by Simon Property Group, L.P.,  the operating partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG). The  offering is comprised of $550 million 2.35% notes due 2022, $750 million 3.25%  notes due 2026, and $550 million notes due 2046.  KEY RATING DRIVERS SPG's 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the company's high-quality retail  real estate portfolio, cycle-tested management team, its market-leading access  to capital, and its significant scale which influences efficiencies and the  aforementioned access to capital. Other strengths include its financial  flexibility that stems from a low dividend payout ratio and a sizable  unencumbered pool. Partially offsetting these strengths is leverage that is low  on an absolute basis but high relative to the rating sensitivities for the 'A'  rating. Moreover, SPG is unspecific about its financial policies and credit  rating targets and has demonstrated a willingness to flex the balance sheet for  external growth opportunities. LEVERAGE STABILIZING AT CURRENT LEVELS Fitch expects leverage will be in the 5x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24  months but closer to 5.5x for 2016, following the stabilization of development  and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x-5.5x is  appropriate for the 'A' rating and thus Fitch's projections are towards the  high-end of the range. These levels are largely unchanged from where SPG has  operated recently with leverage at 5.3x for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016,  compared to 5.4x and 5.2x for full years 2015 and 2014.  Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities plus  dividends from its investment in Klepierre shares net of distributions to  noncontrolling property interests. Leverage when including 50% of preferred  stock and preferred units was unchanged. Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the mid-to-high 4x  range over the next 12-to-24 months as compared to 4.5x for the quarter ended  Sept. 30, 2016. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating  EBITDA plus cash distributions from unconsolidated entities net of distributions  to noncontrolling property interests less recurring capital expenditures and  straight-line rent adjustments divided by total interest incurred and preferred  stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY DRIVING OPERATING PERFORMANCE Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets, which  has supported operating performance despite tenant headwinds and should be more  financeable on a relative basis. The portfolio has scale and diversity with  interests in properties in North America, Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium  Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch views SPG's 3Q16 $604 sales per square foot and  outperformance relative to other mall REITs (as measured by SSNOI growth) as  further indications of the portfolio's quality. Simon has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable NOI growth exceeding  peers by an average of 240 basis points (bps) from 2005-2015 and occupancy  outperforming peers by 100 bps from 2005-2015. SPG has sought to address secular tenant pressures by reducing exposure to  smaller and/or weaker assets through the Washington Prime Group spin-off and  reinvesting in its portfolio through expansion and redevelopment projects.  Nonetheless, persistent tenant headwinds could affect the productivity and  financeability of SPG's portfolio. MARKET-LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views SPG as having sector-leading and durable access to capital, and its  relative and absolute access to debt capital are primary factors behind the 'A'  rating. Substantiating this view is the diversity of SPG's capital sources. SPG  has demonstrated access to debt capital in multiple currencies (USD and EUR),  across a wide range of tenors (commercial paper through 30-year notes) and at  all points in the cycle. SPG re-opened the REIT unsecured debt market in 2009  when it issued $650 million of 10-year notes at 10.4%.  SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY RELATIVE TO OBLIGATIONS SPG has appropriate financial flexibility considering the size of its  obligations. SPG's primary sources of liquidity are its unrestricted cash and  availability under the two revolving credit facilities totalling $7.5 billion  and the contingent liquidity in the unencumbered asset pool.  Liquidity coverage is consistent with the sector at 1.7x for the period Oct. 1,  2016 through Dec. 31, 2018 pro forma for the notes issued in November 2016.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities and projected retained cash flows from operating activities.  Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring capital  expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities  through 2017 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to 2.2x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations  (AFFO) payout ratio, which was 67% in 3Q16 and 66.7% in 2015, compared with 64%  in 2014 and 59.2% in 2013. Fitch estimates that the company generates greater  than $1 billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be  deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Unencumbered  assets (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) cover net unsecured debt by  2.7x, which is appropriate for the rating. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that SPG's operating fundamentals will  remain favorable over the next 12-to-24 months and that the issuer will maintain  leverage consistent with the 'A' rating. Beyond the rating horizon, Fitch  considers the mall's long-term competitive position as a key determinant of  SPG's operating fundamentals, the financeability of its assets and its overall  access to capital.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for the issuer include: --Operating fundamentals remain accommodative but decelerate modestly from  mid-single-digit SSNOI growth to reflect retailer headwinds; --SPG continues to match redevelopment and expansion capex to retained cash flow  from operations after dividends; --SPG maintains market-leading access to capital, refinancing all secured and  unsecured debt with like amounts but does not issue equity.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.3x for  the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016) --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (fixed  charge coverage was 4.5x for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Should SPG demonstrate or speak to more flexible financial policies that  result in a deterioration in the company's market-leading access to capital on  an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Should the competitive position of malls generally or SPG's portfolio  specifically deteriorate due to factors such as retailer headwinds or changing  distribution channels, resulting in weaker operating fundamentals and  financeability of SPG's portfolio;  --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 3x.

139,SPG,"Investors chase reflation trades via stocks, emerging assets: BAML","LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors poured money into stocks, emerging markets and corporate debt in the week to Wednesday, as they continued to chase the Trump-induced reflation trade, data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) showed on Friday. Since Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election win last November, investors have bet that his promised fiscal splurge will boost growth and inflation, fuelling a rally in U.S. stocks. Although details of his spending program are still scarce, an announcement on Thursday of a “phenomenal” tax plan over the next few weeks sent all three U.S. stock indices to record highs.  “It’s inflation-on in stocks,” BAML analysts said in a note. “Flows, at least this week, are clearly showing no fatigue in the ‘leadership’ of the reflation rally.”  BAML remains bullish on risk assets, the bank added. Investors added $6.3 billion to equity funds in a sixth straight week of inflows, and while U.S. stock funds saw outflows, value-oriented U.S. equity funds attracted $1.9 billion while Japanese equities received $3.4 billion.  BAML said this was the largest week of inflows for Japan since the election. Japanese exporters are expected to benefit from U.S. growth as consumer spending picks up.  Investors also poured into emerging markets, with some $2.5 billion of inflows to emerging debt funds, and $1 billion of inflows to emerging equity funds.  Together, emerging stocks and bond funds have seen $11 billion in inflows year-to-date, with the benchmark emerging equity index powering to five-month highs. Emerging stocks have effectively reversed a heavy selloff that they had suffered immediately after Trump’s election. Investors had feared his talk of protectionism and scrapping trade treaties would hurt export-dependent emerging economies. Now, however, investors were chasing this “cyclical laggard”, BAML said, noting Trump’s protectionist threats had so far proved to be dollar-negative. That “has made EM the contrarian Q1 winner”, the bank added.  A dip in bond yields triggered buying of investment grade bonds with a bumper $7.6 billion of inflows, the largest since August 2016.  High-yield, or junk, bonds attracted $1.9 billion, whilst TIPS funds, which invest in inflation-protected securities, took in $1 billion, their biggest week since Trump’s election, the data showed.

141,SPG,U.S.-based bond fund sales soar in latest week: Lipper,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors showed an insatiable demand for fixed income during the latest week, handing over the most cash in about seven months to managers of U.S.-based taxable-bond funds, Lipper data showed on Thursday. The funds gathered $7.5 billion during the week through Feb. 8, marking the sixth straight week of inflows and their strongest sales result since the week that ended July 13, 2016. Investment-grade bond funds took in $4.9 billion during the week, their largest inflows since October 2014, the data showed.  And emerging market debt funds rebounded with their largest inflows since October, $358 million. “This was a big week,” said Pat Keon, senior research analyst for Thomson Reuters Lipper. “It’s part of the enthusiasm, positive thoughts. People are willing to take risk.” Analysts for Bank of America Corp said part of the demand for the funds is foreign buyers taking advantage of lower costs to hold bonds denominated in U.S. dollars while hedging their exposure to greenbacks. “High grade bond fund/ETF inflows have really accelerated this year and are currently running more or less at the highest pace we have seen historically,” the analysts wrote on Wednesday  in a note called “Not your father’s bond fund inflows.” Inflation-protected bond funds attracted $439 million in their ninth week of inflows, while investors added $855 million to loan-participation funds in their 13th straight positive showing. The categories include bonds designed to boost payouts when consumer prices or interest rates rise, for instance in a period of rapid economic growth. Normally, rising inflation or interest rates would hurt a bond’s value, all else being equal. U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office last month, and his Republican Party have touted potential new economic stimulus measures, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending. U.S. stocks have responded by scaling new peaks, while bond returns have been less consistent. Stock fund flows were mixed in the latest week, with demand for funds invested in domestic stocks posting withdrawals of $99 million, compared to inflows of $12.7 billion the week before. But stock funds invested internationally took in $2.5 billion in their fifth straight week netting cash, according to Lipper. Emerging markets stock funds attracted $1.3 billion in their best week since August 2016. “As long as the economy keeps chugging along and things get sorted out in Washington I think we may be ripe for a takeoff,” said Keon.

148,SPG,Fitch Rates Simon Property Group's Notes Offering 'A',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to the multi-tranche senior notes issued by Simon Property Group, L.P., the operating partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG). The offering is comprised of notes due 2022, and 2027. KEY RATING DRIVERS SPG's 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the company's high-quality retail real estate portfolio, cycle-tested management team, its market-leading access to capital, and its significant scale which influences efficiencies and the aforementioned access to capital. Other strengths include its financial flexibility that stems from a low dividend payout ratio and a sizable unencumbered pool. Partially offsetting these strengths is leverage that is low on an absolute basis but high relative to the rating sensitivities for Fitch's 'A' rating. Moreover, SPG is unspecific about its financial policies and credit rating targets and has demonstrated a willingness to flex the balance sheet in the name of external growth opportunities. LEVERAGE STABILIZING AT CURRENT LEVELS Fitch expects leverage will be in the 5x - 5.5x range over the next 12-to-24 months but closer to 5.5x for 2017, following the stabilization of development and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x - 5.5x is appropriate for the 'A' rating and thus Fitch's projection are towards the high-end of the range. These levels are largely unchanged from where SPG has operated recently with leverage at 5.3x for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to 5.3x and 5.4x, respectively, for the years ended Dec. 31, 2016 and Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch projects that fixed charge coverage will sustain in the mid-to-high 4x range over the next 12-to-24 months as compared to 4.8x for the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2017. Fitch includes cash distributions from unconsolidated entities plus dividends form its investment in Klepierre shares net of distributions to noncontrolling property interests when calculating SPG's leverage and coverage metrics. Leverage when including 50% of preferred stock and preferred units was unchanged. STRONG ASSET QUALITY DRIVING OPERATING PERFORMANCE Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets, which has supported operating performance despite tenant headwinds and should be more financeable on a relative basis. The portfolio has scale and diversity with interest in properties in North America, Asia, and Europe ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch views SPG's 1Q17 $615 sales per square foot and outperformance relative to other mall REITs (as measured by SSNOI growth) as further indications of the portfolio's quality. Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable NOI growth and occupancy exceeding peers from 2005 - 2016. SPG has sought to address secular tenant pressures by reducing exposure to smaller and/or weaker assets through the Washington Prime Group spin-off and reinvesting in its portfolio through expansion and redevelopment projects. Nonetheless, persistent tenant headwinds could affect the productivity and financeability of SPG's portfolio. MARKET-LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views SPG as having sector-leading and durable access to capital, and its relative and absolute access to debt capital are primary factors behind the 'A' rating. Substantiating this view is the diversity of SPG's capital sources. SPG has demonstrated access to debt capital in multiple currencies (USD and EUR), across a wide range of tenors (commercial paper through 30-year notes) and at all points in the cycle, as SPG re-opened the REIT unsecured debt market in 2009 when it issued $650 million of 10-year notes at 10.4%. SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY RELATIVE TO OBLIGATIONS SPG has appropriate financial flexibility considering the size of its obligations. SPG's primary sources of liquidity are its unrestricted cash, availability under the two revolving credit facilities totalling $7.5 billion, and the contingent liquidity in the unencumbered asset pool. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio, which was 69.6% in 1Q17, 66.9% in 2016, and 66.7% in 2015. Fitch estimates that the company produces greater than $1 billion of internal generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that SPG's operating fundamentals will remain favorable over the next 12-to-24 months and that the issuer will maintain leverage consistent with the 'A' rating. Beyond the rating horizon, Fitch considers the mall's long-term competitive position as a key determinant of SPG's operating fundamentals, the financeability of its assets, and its overall access to capital. DERIVATION SUMMARY SPG's 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the company's high-quality retail real estate portfolio, cycle-tested management team, its market-leading access to capital, and its significant scale which influences efficiencies and the aforementioned access to capital. Other strengths include its financial flexibility that stems from a low dividend payout ratio and a sizable unencumbered pool. Partially offsetting these strengths is leverage that is low on an absolute basis but high relative to the rating sensitivities for Fitch's 'A' rating. Moreover, SPG is unspecific about its financial policies and credit rating targets and has demonstrated a willingness to flex the balance sheet in the name of external growth opportunities. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for the issuer include: --Operating fundamentals remain accommodative but decelerate modestly from mid-single-digit SSNOI growth to reflect retailer headwinds; --SPG continues to match redevelopment and expansion capex to retained cash flow from operations after dividends; --SPG maintains market-leading access to capital, refinancing all secured and unsecured debt with like amounts but does not issue equity RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.3x for the quarter ended March 31, 2017); --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (coverage was 4.8x for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's Ratings and/or Outlook: --Should SPG demonstrate or speak to more flexible financial policies that result in a deterioration in the company's market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program, resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Should the competitive position of malls generally or SPG's portfolio specifically deteriorate due to factors such as retailer headwinds or changing distribution channels, resulting in weaker operating fundamentals and financeability of SPG's portfolio; --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 3x. LIQUIDITY Fitch expects SPG's liquidity coverage to remain adequate for the rating. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as sources of liquidity (unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities, expected retained cash flow from operating activities after dividend payments and distributions to noncontrolling interests) divided by uses of liquidity (debt maturities, cost-to-complete development expenditures, and capital expenditures). FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates SPG as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-Term IDR 'A'; --Preferred stock 'BBB+'.

150,SPG,Retail REIT shares rally as fear of e-commerce competition ebbs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong earnings from the battered U.S. retail sector, which helped lift Wall Street on Thursday, also boosted shares of the hard-hit real estate investment trusts (REITs) that own the properties where the retailers are located.    Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O), which reported on Thursday its first quarterly profit in nearly two years, brought the retail REITs rally to roughly 7 percent since early least week.   Retail REITs pushed the overall sector to just shy of an all-time high on Thursday, with Macerich Co (MAC.N) rising 1.6 percent and GGP Inc (GGP.N) gaining 1.5 percent. Both Macerich and GGB own high-end Class A malls. Close behind was Simon Property Group (SPG.N), the largest retail property owner among the REITs, which rose 0.58 percent. “We got a snap-back,” said Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at CenterSquare Investment Management, a unit of the Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N). “We’re getting a little bottom put into the sector.”  Stocks of the retail REITs, a small sub-sector, have been crushed by more than 30 percent since last summer. They have started to turn higher as investors focus on those expected to survive the e-commerce onslaught, which has robbed their tenants of foot traffic and sales. Analysts said fears that malls and shopping centers were engulfed in a death spiral were overdone. Lower quality centers, with low foot traffic and undesirable stores, will bear the brunt of downsizing. “There will be some winnowing in this space and it’s largely going to happen in Class B and C malls in outer suburban locations where you just don’t have the foot traffic or the barriers of entry,” said Jay Leupp, who helps oversee some $1.4 billion in global real estate assets at Lazard Asset Management.     The owners of high-end malls in premium urban locations are poised to deliver 5 percent to 6 percent dividend growth over the next two to three years, he said. “Their properties are in high demand, both by brick and mortar retailers, traditional and new concepts as well as online retailers that are using omni-channel strategies,” Leupp said. An omni-channel strategy combines online selling with an actual store. Vacancy rates at malls have declined from 5 percent in 2009 to 4.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle and CoStar Realty Information. The data also shows asking rents are up from a post-recession bottom of $16.26 a square foot in the first quarter of 2015 to $19.81 in the first three months of the year. One example of an investor putting money behind the retail REIT sector is the nearly $500 million spent by Long Pond Capital LP, a hedge fund that mostly invests in well-capitalized real estate and related assets that are in distress. Long Pond Capital declined to discuss its portfolio, a glimpse of which can be seen in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that show its holdings as of March 31. “Tactfully, I would not be going out and shorting a lot of retail REITs, they’ve gone down a lot,” said Crowe.

151,SPG,United Airlines sued by owners of giant rabbit found dead after flight,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The owners of a giant rabbit named Simon who died on a United Airlines flight while bound for the Iowa State Fair sued the carrier on Monday, claiming its employees were responsible for the hare’s death. The lawsuit was filed in Polk County District Court in Des Moines on behalf of a group of investors which purchased Simon, the offspring of the “world’s largest rabbit,” in hopes that he would ultimately surpass his father in size to hold that title and raise money as an exhibit at the fair. Simon, who was less than a year old and already three feet long, was being flown from his hometown in the United Kingdom to Kansas City in early April when was found dead in a kennel during a layover in Chicago. At the time, an attorney for the owners said it was possible that the giant rabbit died after being placed in a freezer for 16 hours on landing, an assertion the airline has denied. The plaintiffs claim in their lawsuit that United employees immediately cremated Simon’s remains without permission of his owners and before a necropsy could determine how he died. “The circumstances and cause of Simon’s death remain highly suspicious,” the group said in its 14-page lawsuit, which accuses the airline of a poor record of handling animals on its flights and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. “We were saddened by Simon’s death in April. We have received this complaint and are currently reviewing it,” United Airlines spokesman Charles Hobart said in a statement.",7262017,http://www.reuters.com/article/united-airlins-rabbit/united-airlines-sued-by-owners-of-giant-rabbit-found-dead-after-flight-idUSL1N1KH2K7

155,SPG,Toys 'R' Us says most top vendors have resumed shipments,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vendors to Toys ‘R’ Us have resumed shipping top products, a bankruptcy lawyer said on Tuesday, allowing the retailer to stock its shelves ahead of the all-important holiday season. “Inventory is on the shelves,” Joshua Sussberg, an attorney with the company’s law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, said at a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing in Richmond, Virginia, adding that the company was well-stocked with the “latest and greatest” in toys. Toys ‘R’ Us generates roughly 40 percent of total revenues in the fourth quarter, and industry experts have expressed concern over the big-box retailer’s ability to retain vendors and customers after its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on Sept. 19. At the time of the filing, nearly 40 percent of its trade base had stopped shipments. Now, 100 percent of merchandise vendors that supply the top 20 products are actively shipping, followed by 49 of the top 50 vendors and 91 of the top 100, Sussberg said. However, Toys ‘R’ Us still owes creditors $5 billion, and at least two major toymakers, Hasbro Inc (HAS.O) and Jakks Pacific, have warned that the bankruptcy would hurt their business this year. Some smaller toymakers have decided to stop shipments. Wayne, New Jersey-based Toys ‘R’ Us, which also owns the Babies ‘R’ Us chain, is among dozens of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers that have struggled under high debt as more consumers shop online. Toys ‘R’ Us is saddled with debt from a $6.6-billion buyout in 2005 by KKR & Co LP, Bain Capital LP and real estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust. As part of its plan to restructure and entice customers, it wants to add event space, hands-on product demonstrations and combine its flagship and Babies ‘R’ Us stores. Some investors were skeptical over the outlook for big-box retailers.  “The opportunity for Toys is difficult given the amount of leverage it had when it entered bankruptcy, as well as its current operating trends,” said George Schultze, distressed specialist and head of Schultze Asset Management. “The outlook in retail is terrible, even for big companies like Toys, so there isn’t a lot of new capital available for that industry.”  Meanwhile, the unsecured creditors committee, which includes Mattel Inc (MAT.O), LEGO Systems and Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N), plans to investigate financial transactions made before the Chapter 11 filing, lawyer Kenneth Eckstein said on Tuesday.

157,SPG,UPDATE 3-Karstadt owner Signa makes offer for Hudson's Bay's Kaufhof,"(Reuters) - Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Co (HBC.TO) said on Wednesday it had received a bid for its German department store chain Kaufhof from Signa Holding, the Austrian property and retail group that owns Karstadt, another German retail chain. Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday, citing sources, that Signa had made a 3 billion euro ($3.5 billion) offer for Kaufhof. Hudson’s Bay did not comment on the bid’s value, and Signa declined to comment. Signa made its offer one week after Hudson’s Bay agreed to sell its flagship Lord & Taylor building in New York for $850 million to WeWork Cos. The Reuters sources said that Signa expects Toronto-based Hudson’s Bay, which has been reluctant so far to engage in negotiations to sell Kaufhof, to respond to the offer by the middle of November. Hudson’s Bay called the offer incomplete, non-binding and unsolicited, with no evidence of financing. The sources said that in its offer letter to Hudson’s Bay, Signa stated its bid for Kaufhof would not be contingent on any third-party financing, since it already has 700 million euros in approved financing from European banks, and also has cash available from a 1 billion euro equity raise last month. Signa has also offered to assume all of Kaufhof’s liabilities, including a 1.34 billion euro real estate loan by German bank LBBW, the sources added. Hudson’s Bay said it plans to review the offer in due course. It added that its European business is an important element of the company’s strategy, and that it remains focused on executing its strategy and plans for the upcoming holiday season. At a valuation of 3 billion euros including debt, Signa’s bid values Kaufhof’s real estate at 2.63 billion euros, the sources said.  The sources asked not to be identified because details of the offer are confidential.  Hudson’s Bay shares ended trading on Wednesday up 9 percent at C$12.29 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of C$2.1 billion ($1.6 billion). Signa tried to buy Kaufhof in 2015, but Hudson’s Bay outbid it by paying 2.5 billion euros including debt for the German chain and its Belgian subsidiary. Since then, Kaufhof’s finances have deteriorated, to the point where vendors are finding it more difficult to find trade credit insurance to make shipments. “If you look at what they are selling right now at Kaufhof, you can see that they don’t have the pulse of the German consumer,” said Lovro Mandac, who stepped down as Kaufhof’s CEO in 2014 after 20 years at the helm. Hudson’s Bay financed the acquisition of Kaufhof by using a joint venture that acquired Kaufhof’s real estate and became its landlord. Hudson’s Bay kept a 63 percent stake in the joint venture, and sold the rest to other major investors, including Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N). This financial engineering backfired, as Kaufhof struggled to cope with the higher rents the joint venture imposed, as well as declining foot traffic in stores. Kaufhof is now trying to convince labor unions in Germany to accept steep pay cuts, a tough ask ahead of the holiday shopping season.  Hudson’s Bay said last week it would raise C$1.6 billion ($1.24 billion) through the divestiture of the Lord & Taylor building, as well as an equity investment in Hudson’s Bay by private equity firm Rhone Capital. Earlier this week, it also said a joint venture between Hudson’s Bay and RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust (REI_u.TO) was exploring a sale of a store property in Toronto.  Selling Kaufhof would release Hudson’s Bay from its liabilities and provide an infusion of cash into the loss-making company at a time when retailers throughout North America are being squeezed by price competition from e-commerce retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Hudson’s Bay remains under pressure from activist hedge fund Land and Buildings, which says the company’s vast real estate portfolio would deliver more value to shareholders if it was sold or used for purposes other than retail. “Hudson’s Bay’s board of directors should, consistent with its fiduciary duties, seriously consider the reported Signa fully financed 3 billion euro offer for Hudson’s Bay’s European business, which is above the company’s purchase price and stated net asset value,” Land and Buildings CEO Jonathan Litt said in a statement. Litt also criticized Hudson’s Bay’s deal last week with Rhone Capital, arguing that there was no reason for the company to opt for a dilutive share issuance when there appeared to be superior sources of capital available. Privately held Signa, founded 17 years ago by property developer Rene Benko, now runs more than 125 retail locations in Northern Europe, generating annual revenue of about 3.8 billion euros, according to its website. It owns a big real estate portfolio with a gross asset value of more than 10 billion euros.  Signa bought Karstadt from the brink of bankruptcy in 2014 for the nominal consideration of just one euro from its majority owner Nicolas Berggruen, son of an international art dealer. Signa restored Karstadt to profitability by realigning its offerings closer to the tastes of German consumers, cutting costs and making operations more efficient. Karstadt and Kaufhof are now the two largest department store operators in Germany.

158,SPG,UPDATE 1-Signa sends Hudson's Bay details of financing for Kaufhof bid,"(Reuters) - Signa Holding GmbH, the Austrian property and retail group that owns German department store operator Karstadt, sent Hudson’s Bay Co (HBC.TO) this week details of the financing it has put together for its 3 billion euro bid ($3.5 billion) for Kaufhof, Germany’s largest retail chain, owned by Hudson’s Bay. Hudson’s Bay, which also owns the Saks Fifth Avenue luxury department store chain, had said last week it would review Signa’s offer for Kaufhof, but also called it incomplete, non-binding and unsolicited, with no evidence of financing. Signa gave Hudson’s Bay a copy of a financing commitment letter from Austrian Raiffeisen Bank International AG for 700 million euros, which, together with a capital increase by Signa last month and the assumption of a 1.34 billion euro real estate loan from German bank LBBW tied to Kaufhof, fully accounts for the Kaufhof bid consideration, according a letter from Signa to Hudson’s Bay dated Nov. 6 and reviewed by Reuters. Privately held Signa also sent Hudson’s Bay confirmation of its bank account balance and a letter from accounting firm KPMG confirming that Signa’s retail arm has 400 million euros in available liquidity and more than 650 million euros of unconditional capital commitments from its shareholders, according to the letter. Signa confirmed the letter but offered no additional comment. A Hudson’s Bay spokesman did not provide any immediate comment.    Hudson’s Bay shares rose as much as 4 percent on the news and were up 3.6 percent at C$12.38 in Toronto on Tuesday afternoon, giving the company a market capitalization of C$2.2 billion ($1.7 billion).  In the Nov. 6 letter to Hudson’s Bay, Signa’s founder and chairman Rene Benko said his company believed it can complete the necessary due diligence to put together a deal for Kaufhof in two weeks, should Hudson’s Bay decide to engage in negotiations. He said there was no need for a deal to be subject to any financing conditions, given that Signa had the funds required. Signa tried to buy Kaufhof in 2015, but Hudson’s Bay outbid it by paying 2.5 billion euros including debt for the German chain and its Belgian subsidiary. Since then, Kaufhof’s finances have deteriorated, to the point where vendors are finding it more difficult to find trade credit insurance to make shipments. Hudson’s Bay financed the acquisition of Kaufhof by using a joint venture that acquired Kaufhof’s real estate and became its landlord. Hudson’s Bay kept a 63 percent stake in the joint venture, and sold the rest to other major investors, including Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N). This financial engineering backfired, as Kaufhof struggled to cope with the higher rents the joint venture imposed, as well as declining foot traffic in stores. Kaufhof is now trying to convince labor unions in Germany to accept steep pay cuts, a tough ask ahead of the holiday shopping season. Karstadt, on the other hand, rents its store space from landlords not affiliated with Signa, after Signa saved it from bankruptcy in 2014 by agreeing to acquire it for the nominal consideration of 1 euro. Following the acquisition of Karstadt, Signa turned the department store chain around by eliminating 3,000 staff and closing three unprofitable stores, rebalancing its offerings to remove unpopular merchandise, and streamlining its logistics and e-commerce operations. Karstadt, the second biggest department store operator in Germany, now holds $320 million in cash and no debt. It went from posting losses before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 85.8 million euros in 2014, to being on track to reporting 87.5 million euros in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in 2017. Kaufhof has 99 department stores in Germany, while Karstadt has 79. Although Signa sees some overlap between the two in 26 locations, it has not yet decided exactly how it would integrate the chains should its bid succeed, according to two sources familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.  Thanks to both its retail and real estate operations, Signa expects to generate an after-tax net profit of approximately 1 billion euros this year, Benko said in the letter. The net asset value of Signa’s holdings is 5.5 billion euros, according to the letter. Hudson’s Bay said last month it would raise C$1.6 billion through the divestiture of its Lord & Taylor flagship building in New York and an equity investment in Hudson’s Bay by private equity firm Rhone Capital. Last week, it also said a joint venture between Hudson’s Bay and RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust (REI_u.TO) was exploring the sale of Hudson’s Bay’s flagship store in downtown Vancouver. Selling Kaufhof would release Hudson’s Bay from its liabilities and provide an infusion of cash into the loss-making company at a time when retailers throughout North America are being squeezed by price competition from e-commerce retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

160,SPG,Fitch Rates Simon Property Group's Notes Offering 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to the multi-tranche senior notes issued by Simon Property Group, L.P., the operating partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG). The offering is comprised of notes due 2023 and 2027. KEY RATING DRIVERS SPG's 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the company's continued market-leading access to capital, high quality real estate portfolio, cycle-tested management team, and its significant scale influencing efficiencies and the aforementioned access to capital. Other strengths include its financial flexibility stemming from a low dividend payout ratio and a sizable unencumbered pool. Partially offsetting these strengths is leverage that is low on an absolute basis but high relative to the rating sensitivities for Fitch's 'A' rating. HEADLINE CREDIT METRICS CONSISTENT: Fitch expects leverage will sustain in the mid-5x range following the stabilization of development and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x-5.5x is appropriate for the 'A' rating, and Fitch's projections are towards the high-end of the range. These levels are largely unchanged from where SPG has operated recently. Fitch projects that fixed charge coverage will sustain in the mid-to-high 4x range. Fitch includes cash distributions from unconsolidated entities plus dividends from its investment in Klepierre shares net of distributions to noncontrolling property interests when calculating SPG's leverage and coverage metrics. STRONG ASSET QUALITY DRIVING OPERATING PERFORMANCE: Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets, which has supported operating performance despite broader retail tenant headwinds, and should be more financeable on a relative basis. The portfolio has scale and diversity with interests in properties in North America, Asia, and Europe ranging from premium outlets to luxury malls. Fitch views SPG's third quarter 2017 (3Q17) $622 sales per square foot and outperformance relative to other mall REITs (as measured by occupancy, leasing spreads, and same store net operating income growth) as further indications of the portfolio's quality. Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with average comparable NOI growth and occupancy exceeding peers from 2005 to 2017 year-to-date. SPG has sought to address secular tenant pressures by reducing exposure to smaller and/or weaker assets through the Washington Prime Group spin-off and reinvesting in its portfolio through expansion and redevelopment projects, particularly the re-tenanting of less productive apparel-focused anchors. Nonetheless, persistent tenant headwinds could affect the productivity and financeability of SPG's portfolio. MARKET-LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL: Fitch views SPG as having sector-leading and durable access to capital and its relative and absolute access to debt capital are primary factors behind the 'A' rating. Substantiating this view is the diversity of SPG's capital sources. SPG has demonstrated access to debt capital in multiple currencies (USD and EUR), across a wide range of tenors (commercial paper through 30-year notes) and at all points in the cycle. STABLE OUTLOOK: The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that SPG's operating fundamentals will remain favorable over the next 12 to 24 months and that the company will maintain leverage consistent with the 'A' rating. Beyond the rating horizon, Fitch considers the mall's long-term competitive position as a key determinant of SPG's operating fundamentals, the financeability of its assets, and its overall access to capital. DERIVATION SUMMARY SPG's 'A' IDR reflects the company's high-quality retail real estate portfolio, cycle-tested management team, market-leading access to capital, conservative financial policies and significant scale which influences efficiencies and its aforementioned access to capital. The combination of these factors place the company in a rating category held only by three other U.S. REITs, Federal Realty Trust (A-/Stable), Equity Residential (A/Stable), and Camden Property Trust (A-/Stable). Simon's Fitch-rated mall peers, CBL & Associates Properties (BB+/Negative) and Washington Prime Group (BBB-/Negative) are several tiers below SPG in asset quality, capital access, and operating fundamentals. Washington Prime was created in 2013 through the spin-off of Simon's lesser real estate assets (mostly B-malls and community centers) and the discrepancy between SPG's remaining portfolio and CBL/Washington Prime's portfolio has been apparent through metrics such as occupancy levels, leasing spreads, tenant sales per square foot, and SSNOI growth. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Operating fundamentals remain accommodative but decelerate modestly from mid-single-digit SSNOI growth to reflect retailer headwinds; --SPG continues to fund redevelopment, external growth capex and share buybacks from retained cash flow from operations after dividends; --SPG maintains market-leading access to capital, refinancing all secured and unsecured debt with like amounts but does not issue equity, instead repurchasing shares on a leverage-neutral basis. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Should SPG demonstrate or speak to more flexible financial policies that result in a deterioration in the company's market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program, resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Should the competitive position of malls generally or SPG's portfolio specifically deteriorate due to factors such as retailer headwinds or changing distribution channels, resulting in weaker operating fundamentals and mortgage financeability of SPG's portfolio; --Fitch expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 3x. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity Coverage: Fitch expects SPG's liquidity coverage to remain adequate for the rating. SPG has appropriate financial flexibility considering the size of its obligations. SPG's primary sources of liquidity are its unrestricted cash, availability under the two revolving credit facilities totalling $7.5 billion, and the contingent liquidity in the unencumbered asset pool. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio. Fitch estimates that the company generates greater than $1 billion of internal liquidity per year, which can be deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Simon as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --Preferred stock 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --Long-Term IDR 'A'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facilities 'A'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A'; --Commercial paper (CP) notes 'F1'. Simon CP 2 --CP notes 'F1'. Simon International Finance, S.C.A. --Unsecured guaranteed notes 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

164,SPG,UPDATE 2-Hudson's Bay says it turns down Signa's offer for Kaufhof chain,"(Reuters) - Hudson’s Bay Co said on Wednesday it has rejected Austrian property and retail group Signa Holding GmbH’s 3 billion euro bid ($3.7 billion) for Hudson’s Bay’s Kaufhof unit, Germany’s largest retail chain.  Hudson’s Bay also said Signa had withdrawn its offer for Kaufhof.  The potential deal would have combined Germany’s two largest department store operators: Kaufhof and Signa’s Karstadt. The rejection comes as Hudson’s Bay named veteran CVS Health Corp executive Helena Foulkes this week as its chief executive officer. Hudson’s Bay, which also owns the Saks Fifth Avenue luxury department store chain, said in November it would review Signa’s offer for Kaufhof, but also called it incomplete, non-binding and unsolicited, with no evidence of financing. “The board has unanimously concluded that Signa’s proposal is not in the best interest of Hudson’s Bay shareholders. It significantly undervalues our German business and related real estate assets and is not supported by sufficient certainty of financing to warrant further consideration at this time,” said David Leith, lead independent director of Hudson’s Bay’s board. Signa withdrew its offer after it became clear during a meeting between Hudson’s Bay Executive Chairman Richard Baker and Signa Chairman René Benko in New York on Tuesday that both sides could not successfully negotiate a deal, according to sources who requested anonymity. A Signa spokesman declined to comment. Reuters reported on Hudson’s Bay’s rejection of Signa’s offer for Kaufhof earlier on Wednesday. Signa tried to buy Kaufhof in 2015, but Hudson’s Bay outbid it by paying 2.5 billion euros including debt for Kaufhof as well as its Belgian subsidiary. Since then, Kaufhof’s finances have deteriorated to the point where vendors are finding it more difficult to find trade credit insurance to make shipments. Hudson’s Bay financed the Kaufhof acquisition by using a joint venture that acquired Kaufhof’s real estate and became its landlord. Hudson’s Bay kept a 63 percent stake in the joint venture, and sold the rest to major investors, including Simon Property Group Inc. The financial engineering backfired as Kaufhof struggled to cope with higher rents that the joint venture imposed as well as declining foot traffic in stores.  However, Hudson’s Bay bolstered its financial position to support Kaufhof, agreeing in October to sell its flagship Lord & Taylor building in New York to WeWork for C$850 million ($680 million). Private equity firm Rhone Capital invested an additional $500 million as part of the deal. Privately held Signa, founded 17 years ago by property developer Rene Benko, now runs more than 125 retail locations in northern Europe, generating annual revenue of about 3.8 billion euros ($4.67 billion), according to its website. It owns a big real estate portfolio with a gross asset value of more than 10 billion euros. Signa bought Karstadt from the brink of bankruptcy in 2014 for the nominal consideration of just one euro from its majority owner Nicolas Berggruen, son of an international art dealer. Signa restructured Karstadt by realigning its offerings closer to the tastes of German consumers, cutting costs and making operations more efficient.

167,SPG,UPDATE 3-France's Klepierre swoops on Hammerson before rival deal is sealed,"LONDON (Reuters) - French shopping centers operator Klepierre (LOIM.PA) has made a 4.9 billion pound ($6.9 billion) bid for Hammerson (HMSO.L), seeking to strike before the British company completes a major takeover of its own. Klepierre said on Monday that it had made a 615 pence-a-share proposal to buy the company behind Birmingham’s Bullring center and London’s Brent Cross, a cash-and-paper bid that it said was rejected by the British group in less than 24 hours.  Hammerson shares surged by 24.5 percent to 544.4 pence at 1515 GMT on news of the approach. The swoop by the French group threatens to scupper Hammerson’s own plan to acquire another London-listed shopping center operator.     Last December, Hammerson, which also owns Bristol’s Cabot Circus and a stake in the Bicester Village retail outlet,  agreed an all-share offer to buy smaller rival Intu Properties (INTUP.L) in a deal that valued Intu at about 3.4 billion pounds.    Hammerson’s investors are yet to approve that takeover, leaving Klepierre, which wants to buy Hammerson on a “standalone basis”, with a window to disrupt the deal.     Furthermore, prior to Monday’s jump, Hammerson’s share price had slumped by about 18 percent since the Intu takeover was announced. That fall had left Hammerson vulnerable to an approach by the French group, analysts said. Paris-based Klepierre owns more than 100 shopping centers across 16 countries but does not have any sites in the UK and Ireland, a gap that a takeover of Hammerson would resolve.    Like other shopping center operators, Klepierre is also grappling with fierce competition from online retailers such as Amazon, a rivalry that is driving consolidation across the commercial property sector.      Indeed, just days after Hammerson announced the Intu deal in December, Europe’s biggest property firm Unibail-Rodamco (UNBP.AS) agreed to buy U.S. and UK mall operator Westfield Corp for $16 billion. Hammerson said on Monday that it remained “fully committed” to the acquisition of Intu, the owner of Manchester’s Trafford Centre.      Klepierre’s bid offered a 40.7 percent premium to Hammerson’s closing share price on March 16, the last trading day before its approach was made public, the French group said.  It added that its aim was start to a “constructive dialogue” with the British company. But Hammerson hit back by saying that the offer significantly undervalued it because it was 20.7 percent lower than its net asset value per share of 776 pence as of the end of December. The bid was on the basis of 50 percent in cash, and the other half in Klepierre shares. “The proposal from Klepierre is wholly inadequate and entirely opportunistic,” Hammerson chairman David Tyler said. “It is a calculated attempt to exploit the disconnect between our recent share price performance and the inherent value of our unique and irreplaceable portfolio which is delivering record results.” Hammerson shares have fallen amid investor worries that the Intu deal raised its exposure to a difficult UK retail market and diluted its higher quality portfolio.   Analysts at Jefferies said on Monday that Hammerson’s Intu tie-up was “losing credibility” and that it was “easy to see why the market isn’t supporting” the deal.    Shares in Klepierre, which counts U.S.-based Simon Property Group (SPG.N) as its biggest investor, were down 4 percent. “I’m guessing Klepierre’s shareholders fear the company will be back with an improved (more expensive) price in a very difficult market (commercial real estate) and they don’t want to hear about a bidding war,” said a Paris-based trader. Shares in Intu, which Simon Property tried to buy in 2011, were up 4.6 percent at 213.5 pence.     Under British takeover rules, Klepierre now has until April 16 to make a firm offer for Hammerson or walk away. Hammerson shareholders are expected to vote on the Intu deal next month, although a date has not yet been set.($1 = 0.7117 pounds) ",3192018,http://www.reuters.com/article/hammerson-ma-klepierre/update-3-frances-klepierre-swoops-on-hammerson-before-rival-deal-is-sealed-idUSL8N1R11ET

170,SPG,"Mall owners Namdar, Washington Prime in bid to buy Bon-Ton -sources","(Reuters) - U.S. mall owners Namdar Realty Group and Washington Prime Group Inc (WPG.N) are in talks to acquire U.S. department store operator Bon-Ton Stores Inc (BONTQ.PK) out of bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Namdar’s and Washington Prime’s bid for Bon-Ton offers a path for the retailer to survive, three sources said. Firms specializing in liquidation plan to submit a $740 million offer for Bon-Ton in partnership with its bondholders. If that bid were to prevail, the company would be dismantled. Bon-Ton, which filed for bankruptcy in February with about 250 stores, is a significant tenant of both Namdar and Washington Prime malls. Its survival would help protect the value of these malls, the sources said. Namdar plans to work with its partner, Mason Asset Management, which jointly invests with Namdar and manages its properties, on the bid.  Bon-Ton extended the deadline for bids in its bankruptcy auction last week to April 4, after announcing it was in active discussions with a bidder whom it did not identify. That bidder is the consortium of Namdar and Washington Prime, according to the sources. [nL1N1RD01L] Namdar and Washington Prime are still working on securing funding for the deal, and may use their properties to raise debt to finance the acquisition, the sources said. There is no certainty their bid will be successful, and it is possible the bid deadline is extended once again, one of the sources added. Namdar and Mason declined to comment. Washington Prime and Bon-Ton did not immediately return requests for comment.  Liquidators and Bon-Ton’s bondholders, led by hedge fund Brigade Capital Management LP, have been calling for Bon-Ton’s wind down for months. Their $740 million offer for the company includes $540 million in cash and the bondholders’ debt, one of the sources said.  The bondholders’ bid would fund Bon-Ton’s wind-down, and would also give the retailer’s other creditors the option to acquire the department stores’ leases, intellectual property and shop fixtures. The creditors could then sell those assets to any parties interested in re-opening the stores, the sources said.    Namdar and Mason own about 130 malls across the United States and in recent years have acquired properties from several real estate investment trusts, including CBL & Associates Properties Inc (CBL.N), Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI.N) and GGP Inc (GGP.N). It has also bought properties out of bankruptcy auctions.  Washington Prime, spun out of Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) in 2014, owns interests in 108 properties.
