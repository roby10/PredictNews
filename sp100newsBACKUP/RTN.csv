The Council on Foreign Relations’ survey, distributed on Thursday, took into account outlays by the United States, NATO allies, Japan, South Korea, Israel and Saudi Arabia.   This group’s combined share of global military spending fell from 77 percent in 2005 to 72 percent in 2010 and appeared set to drop to 66 percent by 2015, the researchers found.   “The U.S. and its allies retain a dominant share but it declines dramatically,” Paul Swartz, the report’s co-author who monitors links between international economics and military spending at the council, said in a telephone interview.   The study uses International Monetary Fund growth estimates for all countries surveyed.   Washington’s share of global military spending is set to decline to about 39 percent by 2015 from 41 percent in 2010 with U.S. economic growth projected to lag that of powers such as Russia, China and India, the study showed.   Even if the United States were to keep military spending at a constant share of its own GDP, its shrinking weight in the world economy would cut its share of the global total.   China’s share of world GDP is projected to jump to 11.8 percent in 2015, more than double its share in 2005, according to the IMF. The U.S. share, by contrast, is forecasted to fall to 21.1 percent from 27.7 percent in 2005.   President Barack Obama called in April for cutting projected national security spending $400 billion, by some counts about 6 percent, through 2023 as part of a deficit reduction push.   If the Obama plan is implemented, the U.S. share will fall further. And if China or some other rising power opts to make military spending a higher priority, U.S. military pre-eminence could decline even more sharply, the study showed.   Such trends have potentially significant implications for the sale of weapons made by top Pentagon suppliers such as Lockheed Martin Corp  (LMT.N), Boeing Co (BA.N), Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), General Dynamics (GD.N), BAE Systems Plc  (BAES.L) and Raytheon Co  (RTN.N) .   The cost of military hardware has grown more than inflation, the study said, such that today’s spending “results in less procurement” than in the past.   It found that the United States must spend about 1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on weapons just to maintain existing levels of equipment.   Post World War Two U.S. military spending as a percent of GDP has ranged from a 15 percent high in 1952 during the Korean War to a low of 3.7 percent in 2000, a period of relative calm before the Sept. 11, 2001, hijacking attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Today, it accounts for just under 6 percent, according to the study.   A decline in the U.S. share of world military spending seems likely in the absence of a new sense of insecurity, the study said.   Sebastian Mallaby, a globalization expert at the council, said in a related piece on Thursday in the Financial Times newspaper that the United States could sustain its global dominance if it has the political will to allocate a rising share of GDP to the Pentagon.

2,RTN,Analysis: Electronic warfare moves to frontline,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - As the United States draws down troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and cuts back on defense spending, its reliance on technology will only rise, benefiting a clutch of companies specializing in intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance.  The U.S. military will need more equipment like infrared sensors, jammers and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems to counter threats to its troops, with the Obama administration planning to cut troops in Afghanistan by a third by 2012, and exit from Iraq by the end of this year.  “(The United States) will have to continue to keep an eye on what is occurring in these countries. So, we will invest in intelligence gathering equipment to complement the decrease in actual forces on ground,” Lazard Capital Markets analyst Michael Lewis said.  Defense technology companies such as signal intelligence systems maker Mercury Computer Systems, night-vision systems specialist FLIR Systems and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) maker AeroVironmentare expected to benefit from this shift in defense spending priorities.  “What you are going to see is the need for more of the advanced or next-generation capabilities that enable force protection, increased situational awareness and survivability capabilities,” analyst Michael Ciarmoli of KeyBanc Capital Markets said.  Despite the cuts to U.S. defense spending, Ciarmoli sees a “healthy” expansion of funding, probably in the high single digits, for the high-margin intelligence and surveillance, and defense electronics businesses.  In April, President Barack Obama asked the defense department to come up with $400 billion in spending cuts spread over 12 years. The war in Afghanistan alone costs the United States more than $110 billion a year.  “Certainly, having high troop level presence is very expensive ... So, if you draw down and ultimately have a stand-off technology approach ... you will have a net gain in terms of lower costs,” Gleacher & Co analyst Peter Arment said.  Other companies expected to benefit from the shift include Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc and Comtech Telecommunications Corp.  The way the United States has fought the war in Libya, with focus on providing technology to allies in the battle field, is also a pointer to the change in the future model for military engagement overseas.  “Assuming it conducts future missions in this fashion, we believe next-generation capabilities will continue to be procured in a rapid manner, which also augurs well for select defense contractors,” analyst Ciarmoli said.  One piece of equipment that is expected to see a jump in funding is electronic jammers used to counter the improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that have maimed and killed many troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.  IEDs are difficult to counter with conventional bomb detection systems, and industrial major ITT Corp last August won a $455 million contract to develop the jammers, known as joint counter radio-controlled improvised explosive device electronic warfare (JCREW).  Mercury Computer Systems is a sub-contractor for providing signal processing technology for the latest version of JCREW.  “Key to the signal processing technology in JCREW is to defeat an adversary signal that detonates a bomb ... We have certainly seen improvements in Mercury’s business as a result of its positioning in the market,” Lazard Capital’s Lewis said.  Another red-hot opportunity is onboard signal processing for aircraft, including unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, that the U.S. forces increasingly rely on in conflict zones.  Mercury Computer and a large number of private companies compete with larger rivals like Curtiss Wright Corp in this market.  “Aircraft, manned or unmanned, want to have these systems to take less power, they want it to be lighter. So, companies that can provide this are in good space right now to continue to see contract flowing,” Lewis said.  The new opportunities are also expected to sustain the current M&A momentum in the sector.  The last one year saw defense giants like Boeing Co, Safran and Raytheon Co snapping up smaller rivals for their technologies.  FLIR Systems bought ICx Technologies in a $274 million deal last August to expand into the market for sensing technologies. In May, Kratos agreed to buy rival Integral Systems for $225 million to expand in the surveillance and intelligence business.  “Most of the deals by the large defense companies will be billion dollars and under,” Gleacher & Company’s Arment said.  The deals may not add significantly to the large companies’ earnings, but will help them acquire the fast-growing technological capabilities, Arment said.

3,RTN,Dealtalk: L-3 eyes some divestitures but no breakup,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - L-3 Communications Holdings Inc (LLL.N), which faces breakup pressure from an activist investor, is expected to divest some low-end services assets but does not plan a broader portfolio restructuring such as a breakup, people familiar with the situation said.  The U.S. defense contractor, with a market value of about $9 billion, is considering spinning off or selling a portion of its government services division that it views as non-strategic, these people said.  Those assets could collectively have revenues in the neighborhood of $1 billion — or roughly a quarter of the division’s $4 billion sales last year — the sources said.  Such a move is in line with what L-3 has been contemplating for almost a year as the company reviews its entire portfolio in the face of a slimmer U.S. defense budget, the people said. But it appears to be short of what Ralph Whitworth’s Relational Investors has urged since amassing a near-6 percent stake in the company.  Relational, the largest single shareholder in L-3, wants the company to sell or spin off its government services as well as aircraft modernization and maintenance operations, a person close to the investor told Reuters previously.  Relational sees those two divisions, which accounted for more than 40 percent of L-3’s sales last year, as a drag on the company’s two better performing units: defense electronics and intelligence and surveillance, according to the person.  The services and aircraft divisions both had operating margins of just above 8 percent in 2010. In comparison, the electronics division’s margins exceeded 14 percent, while the intelligence unit saw 11.6 percent in margins.  Despite the uneven performance, its businesses are all defense related and depend heavily on the U.S. government, and the company is not convinced there would be an additional value created from breaking up the company into several pieces, people familiar with the situation said.  Earlier this year, Relational pressured industrial conglomerate ITT Corp (ITT.N) to split into three companies, separately focused on water purification, industrial components and defense. While defense generated only half of total revenue, uncertainty about U.S. budget cuts held back the entire company’s share performance.  But the argument for breakup is less clear in L-3’s case, industry experts have said, since its businesses are all defense related and the stock is trading at a decent premium to giant defense conglomerates like Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), Raytheon (RTN.N) or Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N).  There could be some gain if L-3 were split into multiple divisions and those units would then get acquired at a premium by rivals in a two-step process, some sources said. But what are seen as most attractive takeover targets — electronics  and intelligence divisions — are where the company wants to focus its growth.  Instead, L-3 would like to do a small divestiture within the services division at this point, separating the labor-intensive military support business while keeping the high-end intelligence and cyber-focused part, people familiar with the matter said.  Whether L-3 will pursue a spin-off or a sale of these assets will depend on how big a tax burden associated with any sale is likely to be, the people said.  The company is also expected to focus on returning capital to shareholders by a share buyback or increased dividend, people close to the situation said.  Shares of L-3 were up 1.2 percent to $85.24 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning, valuing the firm at more than $9 billion.  Representatives for L-3 declined to comment. Relational was not immediately available for comment.  Activist investors are increasingly scouring the aerospace and defense industry for breakup targets as shares of large defense contractors have languished on fears of softening military spending as the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down.  Billionaire investor Carl Icahn earlier this month reported a 9.5 stake in Oshkosh Corp (OSK.N), which makes tactical vehicles for the military and specialty trucks for construction, and said he was seeking talks with the management to enhance shareholder value.  Industry experts also mentioned Cessna aircraft maker Textron Inc (TXT.N) as a potential target because its products range from helicopters to automotive parts and golf cars, while a subsidiary finances sales of them.  The increased activism across the sector is putting additional pressure on the defense contractors as they seek ways to compete in a shrinking budget environment after a decade of booming defense spending.  “Many of the biggest defense companies are generating strong profits and carrying billions of dollars in uncommitted cash, but the market is undervaluing shares because of what it fears lies ahead for military contractors,” defense analyst Loren Thompson said.  “Activist investors are stepping up the pressure on them to bolster shareholder returns, even if that means abandoning strategies aimed at making companies more resilient for the long term,” Thompson said.

5,RTN,UK anti-corruption drive has US companies sweating,"  * Big focus on beefing up internal compliance  * Britain expected to pursue several high-profile cases  * Even insurers see opportunities in anti-corruption area  * Defense contractors, pharmaceutical firms seem vulnerable   By Andrea Shalal-Esa   WASHINGTON, July 15 (Reuters) - U.S. companies, already sweating under heightened enforcement of anti-corruption laws at home, are nervously reviewing their policies on how they wine and dine business contacts abroad in the wake of tough new regulations imposed in Britain.   The new law, which took effect July 1, bans all so-called facilitating payments and does not expressly allow entertainment of government officials and others.   The jury is still out on how rigorously British authorities will choose to enforce the law. Companies in the defense, pharmaceuticals, energy and telecommunications sectors are seen as particularly vulnerable.   At the same time, U.S. companies are grappling with tighter rules at home too. New whistleblower rules approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have also spurred companies to scrutinize their existing compliance programs, according to legal experts in the United States and Washington.   “We have definitely seen an uptick in our business in the anti-corruption and anti-bribery area,” said Ed Rubinoff, a Washington-based expert on export controls and foreign corruption with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld.   Just this week, U.S. lawmakers urged federal officials to investigate whether News Corp (NWSA.O) broke the U.S. law banning bribes to foreign officials. [ID:nL6E7I9069]   Akin Gump has added lawyers to handle the extra work, and now has 16 attorneys working on regulatory compliance in the United States, three in London and more in Abu Dhabi, Geneva and Beijing, Rubinoff told Reuters.   Lawyers at other big-name firms report similar trends, noting that the British law and the new SEC rules offering incentives to whistleblowers have galvanized some U.S. firms that had less-than-stellar compliance programs in the past.   Paul Huey-Burns, a partner with Bryan Cave, urged clients to review internal controls, rehearse how to respond to a possible whistleblower report, and establish an unequivocal “no retaliation” policy to avert problems.   Attorneys are reluctant to identify specific companies that are tightening their internal rules for fear of attracting unwanted attention from U.S. or international regulators, but say the issue has attracted a lot of attention by nearly all companies that do business overseas.   “There’s a lot going on,” said Sharie Brown, who chairs DLA Piper’s anti-bribery, anti-corruption and compliance group.   FEAR-MONGERING   Legal experts say U.S. companies are girding for the worst in Britain.   Senior British officials, however, are pushing back against what they call fear-mongering by compliance professionals and lawyers on this side of the Atlantic, and have told U.S. experts that they plan to focus on significant violations, not reasonable business entertainment for government officials.   Chastened by years of criticism from U.S. officials, British authorities will likely be looking for some high-profile cases to demonstrate their commitment to increased enforcement, said Brown, a former U.S. federal prosecutor.   Initial cases would likely piggyback on probes already in the U.S. Justice Department pipeline, and could involve firms in the defense, pharmaceutical, energy and telecommunications sectors, given their frequent use of third-party intermediaries and dealings with state-owned enterprises abroad, she said.   The FBI last month told a meeting at SEC headquarters it was keeping a close eye on deals between global aerospace firms and state-owned airlines, possible violations involving the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil, and the reopening of South Sudan’s oil industry.   Insurers also see opportunities in the compliance arena. Marsh, a unit of Marsh and McLennan Companies Inc (MMC.N) and the world’s biggest insurance broker, this week launched a new insurance policy that covers companies and individuals for bribery-related investigations that can result in “significant legal, accounting, auditing, and consulting costs.”   The UK law differs from the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in several ways, casting a wider net for which foreign officials are covered, and imposing unlimited fines on companies that do business in Britain if they cannot prove they have adopted adequate measures to ban bribery. [ID:nL6E7HS2EZ]   U.S. companies are urging British authorities to provide more detailed guidance on how they will interpret the new law, said Justin Williams, a partner with Akin Gump in London.   Williams said the new law lets British authorities opt out of pursuing cases that could jeopardize the UK national interest, which means that despite the tough new law, Britain could still avert prosecutions in cases like the one involving BAE Systems Plc. (BAES.L)   Britain’s Serious Fraud Office in 2006 halted an investigation into alleged bribes paid by BAE Systems in connection with a huge arms deal with Saudi Arabia amid fears that it would threaten UK national security. BAE later paid $400 million to settle related charges raised by the United States.   “It’s by no means certain that a case like that would be brought under the new regime,” Williams said. “We’re going to have to see how the enforcement works.”   BAE Systems carefully reviewed the new UK law, and concluded policies and procedures put in place after the Saudi arms deal would exceed the new requirements, Brian Roehrkaesse, a U.S.-based spokesman for the company, told Reuters.

6,RTN,Defense contractor sales miss Wall Street view,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Two top U.S. defense contractors posted sales that missed Wall Street’s expectations on Wednesday in a sign that federal efforts to rein in military spending are starting to take a toll.  General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) nonetheless managed to beat earnings expectations, reflecting their drive to scale back less-profitable businesses at a time of declining U.S. defense spending.  With lawmakers in Washington battling over how to cut the nation’s deficit — and whether to raise the debt ceiling or to allow the U.S. to slip into default — defense contractors acknowledge their businesses will be in the cross-hairs in the coming years.  “Although it is not yet certain today how or when the debt ceiling is raised, it is clear that defense spending will play a role in helping to ease the country’s economic challenges,” said General Dynamics Chief Executive Jay Johnson, on a conference call with analysts.  He expects the heaviest cuts to the nation’s defense spending to come in the second half of the current decade rather than in the next few years.  Army General Martin Dempsey, the nominee to become the nation’s top military officer warned a U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday that it would be “extraordinarily difficult” to cut $800 billion from the nation’s defense budget.  That $800 billion cut represents a doubling of President Barack Obama’s prior proposal that some in Congress have suggested as way to reduce the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt.  Despite the weak revenue, both General Dynamics and Northrop raised their full-year profit forecasts, a day after the No. 1 Pentagon supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), did likewise.  “We are increasing our EPS guidance and maintaining our guidance for cash generation, despite a reduced top line outlook that reflects the realities of our current budget environment,” said Wes Bush, CEO of Northrop, with businesses that include making unmanned spy planes.  Both companies’ shares fell on a day that U.S. markets were broadly lower, spooked by the debt talks and worries of a slowing U.S. economy. General Dynamics shares were down 3 percent to $68.24 and Northrop fell 4.5 percent to $62.46. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  Fellow defense contractors Raytheon Co (RTN.N) and L-3 Communications (LLL.N) are scheduled to report their earnings on Thursday.  Northrop raised its 2011 profit target to a range of $6.75 to $6.90 per share, which at its midpoint would represent an increase of a little under 1 percent from 2010. Its previous forecast implied a 2.5 percent drop. That move came even as it lowered its full-year sales forecast by 2 percent to $27 billion.  “While we think there will continue to be long-term margin pressure for defense names, Northrop continues to hold in well,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard, in a note to clients.  General Dynamics, which makes tanks, ships and Gulfstream jets, raised its full-year profit forecast to a range of $7.15 to $7.20 per share from continuing operations, representing growth of about 5 percent. Its prior forecast had implied growth of 3 percent.  Northrop has been moving to streamline its operations over the past year, and in March spun off its ship operations, citing little synergy with its other businesses that include drones and ballistic missile defense work. The spin-off created Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII.N).  Its second-quarter net profit fell 27 percent to $520 million, or $1.81 per share, compared with $711 million, or $2.34 per share, a year earlier, when Northrop recorded a large tax benefit.  Analysts, on average, had looked for profit of $1.68 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Northrop reported revenue of $6.56 billion, down 9.6 percent and shy of the  $6.98 billion analysts had expected.  General Dynamics’ second-quarter net income was $653 million, or $1.76 per share, up less than 1 percent from $648 million, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier.  Factoring out one-time items, profit came to $1.79 per share, above the $1.72 that analysts had forecast.  Revenue fell 2.8 percent to $7.88 billion, below the $8.24 billion analysts had expected.  As of Tuesday's close, General Dynamics shares were little changed for the year, while Northrop had risen close to 11 percent. The Dow Jones U.S. defense index .DJUSDN was up 6 percent for the year, a slightly lower gain than the overall U.S. market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX.

Its second-quarter net profit fell 27 percent to $520 million, or $1.81 per share, compared with $711 million, or $2.34 per share, a year earlier, when Northrop recorded a large tax benefit.   Analysts, on average, had looked for profit of $1.68 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Northrop reported revenue of $6.56 billion, down 9.6 percent and shy of the the $6.98 billion analysts had expected.   General Dynamics’ second-quarter net income was $653 million, or $1.76 per share, up less than 1 percent from $648 million, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier.   Factoring out one-time items, profit came to $1.79 per share, above the $1.72 that analysts had forecast.   Revenue fell 2.8 percent to $7.88 billion, below the $8.24 billion analysts had expected.   As of Tuesday's close, General Dynamics shares were little changed for the year, while Northrop had risen close to 11 percent.

12,RTN,Debt impasse may pressure defense contractors-Moody's," * Payment disruptions could squeeze liquidity   * Blue-chip companies could still access capital markets   * Index surveys 53 companies in aerospace/defense sector   NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - U.S. defense contractors could face a liquidity squeeze from disrupted payments if the government fails to raise the debt ceiling, Moody’s Investors Service said on Friday.   “U.S. military contractors are already feeling increasing pressure from the ongoing deficit debate, political posturing and more stringent contract terms,” Russell Solomon, a Moody’s senior vice president, said in a statement.   Moody’s warned that companies with above-average dependence on revenue from the government and relatively limited existing liquidity were more vulnerable to a government shutdown.   Moody’s new Defense Contractor Liquidity Index surveys 53 public and private companies with primary operations in the aerospace and defense industry and calculates near-imminent available sources of liquidity relative to estimated annual U.S. government revenue.   While the more exposed group in the index contains three of the five largest defense contractors — General Dynamics (GD.N), Raytheon (RTN.N) and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) — Moody’s said it believes these investment-grade companies could readily access the capital markets if unexpected payment disruptions occur for an extended period of time.   In a report on the sector, Moody’s said overall liquidity was reasonably robust, even though about half of the average company’s $11 billion in annual revenue stems from government business.   Average cash balances are about $1.2 billion, and almost 90 percent of revolving lines of credit remain undrawn and available for borrowing if needed, Moody’s said.

15,RTN,Analysis: Health and defense lobby groups ready for super fight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With as much as $1.5 trillion in federal funds hanging in the balance, the mammoth healthcare and defense industries are scrambling to lobby a special congressional committee tasked with slashing the deficit — but in markedly different ways.  The 12-member bipartisan joint “super committee” is expected to focus heavily on both pricey government health insurance programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the Pentagon budget, which accounts for about half of non-mandated federal spending.  But the similarities end there.  The Pentagon is warning of Doomsday if the committee fails to act through a combination of spending reductions and revenue increases, triggering automatic cuts of about $600 billion each in defense and non-defense accounts.  Some health care groups, by contrast, might even prefer the committee to fail, reasoning that spending cutbacks are a fact of life and known reductions are preferable to unknown ones. They’ll seek instead to ensure key interests are protected.  The differing approaches by two major sectors of the U.S. economy reflect their divergent circumstances and histories. Health care groups are used to being on the firing line; the Defense Department has seen a decade of handsome budget increases since the 9/11 attacks.  The ultimate winners and losers may owe the outcome partly to the persuasive power of public relations experts, campaign-style coalition-building and lobbyists, some of the most formidable forces on Capitol Hill.  Under the bitterly fought deal that raised the U.S. debt ceiling, the Pentagon is already getting a $350 billion haircut over the next 10 years, a roughly 6 percent reduction relative to current Congressional Budget Office spending projections.  Lawmakers will be forced to weigh the national security impact of further trims in security spending against the interests of vulnerable elderly, disabled and poor Americans. Inflicting pain on either side of this equation will come with a significant political cost.  Health care groups are used to seeing their programs on the chopping block. That’s a consequence of growing recognition of the funding problems for federal entitlement programs such as Medicare — which provides health insurance to 47 million elderly and disabled Americans.  Left unreformed, Medicare, along with Social Security and Medicaid — the federal health program for the poor — will devour 100 per cent of all tax revenues by 2047, according to the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office.  “As we’ve seen, health policy is now budget policy,” said Licy Do Canto, health care lobbyist and head of the Docanto Group. “It’s not a question of when; it’s a question of how much.”  Many groups with a stake in health care spending said their lobbying will focus on the impact that entitlement cuts would have on seniors, the disabled and the families that care for them. One tactic will be to encourage patients to present their own stories directly to committee members.  But these groups may diverge in what programs they’d like to see cut. Insurers, drug and device companies, and providers such as hospitals and doctors — the main health care players — have traditionally had opposing interests.  Some don’t see disaster in the committee’s automatic trigger mechanism, which would ordain a $1.2 trillion cut in federal spending starting in 2013 if the panel’s 12 members can’t come up with their own plan. The trigger option will not touch Medicaid.  “People fear the unknown much more than the known, particularly because the sequester limits and caps the liability of these health interests,” said Chris Jennings, co-director of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s health project.  For the Defense Department, on the other hand, the automatic trigger is a “doomsday mechanism,” Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said earlier this month.  With so much at stake, military suppliers have banded together more closely than ever through their chief trade group for a stepped-up effort to save defense programs — and jobs.  “American leadership in aerospace and defense is being threatened by forces in Congress and the administration,” says a web site sponsored by the Aerospace Industries Association, or AIA, which represents U.S. makers of everything from military and civil aircraft to space systems.  The site, www.SecondtoNone.org, is to be unveiled formally in coming weeks as part of a drive to build long-term support for the industry — with a special eye on the super committee.  The broad outlines of the stepped-up campaign emerged from a consensus of the trade group’s 16-member executive committee, which includes executives from such top Pentagon suppliers as Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co, and Northrop Grumman Corp.  AIA has retained LMG Inc, a Washington public affairs firm, to help develop its messages and strategy. It is also drawing on the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy group, and the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a policy research institute, to boost the campaign’s intellectual firepower.  “This is do or die,” said Michael Herson, president of American Defense International, a Washington-based government affairs consultancy. Herson, whose clients include Northrop Grumman, Raytheon Co and United Technologies Corp UTX.N>, said he had never seen the industry come together for such a concerted campaign.  “We believe this environment will persist for some time,” said Fred Downey, AIA’s vice president for national security, emphasizing that the effort would not just target the special “supercommittee.”  Efforts to persuade are likely to include appealing to supporters in Congress, state governors and constituents at home.  However, blurry rules about financial disclosures and general transparency may be keeping some lobbyists in a holding pattern for now.  Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana introduced legislation in early August to require the 12 panel members to disclose donations of more than $1,000 while serving on the committee, complicating matters for lobbyists.  “The lobbyist who gets a face-to-face meeting with a panel member for 10 minutes will be rare,” said Ike Skelton, a former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.

17,RTN,UPDATE 4-US sale of fighter jets to Taiwan unlikely-sources," * Taiwan sought jets to counter China’s strength   * China had warned US that deal could inflame tensions   * Upgrades to existing fighters still possible  (Recasts throughout with comments, Lockheed statement)   By Phil Stewart   WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A U.S. sale of 66 new Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) F-16 C/D fighter jets to Taiwan appears unlikely to go through, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, although they cautioned that no final decision has been reached.   Taiwan has repeatedly asked Washington to agree to sell it the advanced F-16 fighter jets, citing the need to counter the growing military strength of China, which views the island as a breakaway province.   China cut off ties with the U.S. military for most of last year to protest an American arms package for Taiwan. While other deals were possible, sources following the issue said they believed Washington would probably opt against the sale of new F-16s.   “If the Obama administration goes this way, as expected, then it’s a political decision,” said Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, which supports the sale of new fighter jets to Taiwan.   A source familiar with the matter, who declined to be named, also said the deal appeared unlikely but said no decision had been made.   Defense News, citing an unnamed Taiwan defense official, reported on Sunday that the United States had formally refused Taiwan’s request for the Lockheed Martin jets, claims that were not confirmed in the United States.   A State Department official said no decisions have been made on potential arms sales to Taiwan.   A spokeswoman at Lockheed Martin said the company had not been informed by the U.S. government of a final decision regarding the sale of new F-16s to Taiwan or of upgrades to its existing fleet.   Hammond-Chambers said he believed the Obama administration was expected instead to offer Taiwan a package for upgrading existing F-16A/B jets worth up to $4.2 billion.   Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said it could not comment on the Defense News report, as it had not heard from the United States.   “However, we want to point out that the Republic of China (Taiwan) does hope the sale of new F-16C/D fighter aircraft will go through. We are in urgent need of the aircraft,” spokesman Luo shou-he told Reuters.   The House Foreign Affairs Committee last month urged Obama to sell Taiwan “all the F-16 fighter jets that are needed by Taiwan.” A Republican aide to the committee said it had not been notified of any decision on the matter.   Any fresh U.S. arms support to Taiwan is likely to raise hackles in Beijing, but the advanced fighter jets have been an especially touchy point for China, which this week will host U.S. Vice President Joe Biden. [ID:nN1E77E11A]   The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979 and recognizes Beijing’s “one China” policy. But it is also Taiwan’s biggest ally and arms supplier and is duty-bound by legislation to help the island in the event of attack.   Washington had been set to make a decision by October on Taiwan’s request for the fighter jets, balancing its legal obligations to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act against the need to avoid upsets with a major creditor and trading partner, China.   “Frankly, it is not a real surprise. The real surprise is that they sold them the F-16s in the first place,” said Richard Bitzinger, a senior fellow and regional defense expert at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.   But Bitzinger said it was not a total victory for Beijing because a potential upgrade to existing fighters would go a long way in covering Taiwan’s loss of a new batch of F-16s.   “The types of upgrades they are talking about would make them the most advanced F-16s in the world. This is a significant upgrade, and I am sure a lot of that work will go to Taiwanese companies. In that regard, it may be a better deal,” he said.   In May, a visiting Chinese military commander warned against any future U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. And recently, a popular tabloid linked to China’s Communist Party’s mouthpiece argued that China should use its “financial weapon to slap Washington” over any arms sales to Taiwan.

18,RTN,U.S. refuses Taiwan request for new jets: report,"TAIPEI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has refused Taiwan’s request for 66 new Lockheed Martin F-16C/D fighter jets which China had warned Washington would risk inflaming tensions between the two big powers, Defense News reported, citing a Taiwan defense official.  Taiwan has repeatedly asked Washington to agree to sell the advanced F-16 fighter jets, citing the need to counter the growing military strength of China, which deems the island a breakaway province that must eventually accept reunification, by force if necessary.  Laura Siebert, Lockheed Martin’s spokeswoman for the F-16 program, had no immediate comment on the Defense News report.  Neither Washington nor Taipei has made any formal announcement about the latest call for the fighters.  A State Department official said no decisions have been made on potential arms sales to Taiwan.  Defense News (www.defensenews.com) said on Sunday that Taiwan had been told there would be no sale, citing Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense.  “We are so disappointed in the United States,” the report quoted an unnamed Taiwan defense official as saying.  “A U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) delegation arrived here last week to deliver the news and offer instead a retrofit package for (Taiwan’s) older F-16A/Bs,” the journal reported from Taipei.  The proposed $4.2 billion upgrade package would make the 146 Taiwanese F-16A/Bs among the most capable variants of the aircraft, the report said.  The new gear would include an AESA radar, likely either Northrop Grumman’s Scalable Agile Beam Radar or the Raytheon Advanced Combat Radar, it said.  Any fresh U.S. arms support to Taiwan is likely to raise hackles in Beijing, but the advanced fighter jets have been an especially touchy point for China, which this week will host U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.  The bitter debate in the U.S. Congress over spending and the downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by Standard & Poor’s drew blunt criticism from China’s state media, including a commentary that said the U.S. debt woes reflected its military overreach abroad.  Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said it could not comment on the report, as it had not heard from the United States.  “However, we want to point out that the Republic of China (Taiwan) does hope the sale of new F-16C/D fighter aircraft will go through.

But Bitzinger said it was not a total victory for Beijing because a potential upgrade to existing fighters would go a long way in covering Taiwan’s loss of a new batch of F-16s.  “The types of upgrades they are talking about would make them the most advanced F-16s in the world. This is a significant upgrade, and I am sure a lot of that work will go to Taiwanese companies. In that regard, it may be a better deal,” he said.  The Obama administration’s decision to move forward with a set of arms sales to Taiwan last year triggered an angry response from Beijing, which curtailed many military contacts and threatened to sanction companies involved in the sales.  Since then, Beijing and Washington have patched up ties, but the potential sale of more U.S. weapons to Taiwan remains a sensitive issue.  In May, a visiting Chinese military commander warned against any future U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. And recently, a popular tabloid linked to China’s Communist Party’s mouthpiece argued that China should use its “financial weapon to slap Washington” over any arms sales to Taiwan.

19,RTN,U.S. refuses Taiwan request for new jets: report,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - The United States has refused Taiwan’s request for 66 new Lockheed Martin F-16C/D fighter jets which China had warned Washington would risk inflaming tensions between the two big powers, Defense News reported, citing a Taiwan defense official.  Taiwan has repeatedly asked Washington to agree to sell the advanced F-16 fighter jets, citing the need to counter the growing military strength of China, which deems the island a breakaway province that must eventually accept reunification, by force if necessary.  Laura Siebert, Lockheed Martin’s spokeswoman for the F-16 program, had no immediate comment on the Defense News report.  Neither Washington nor Taipei has made any formal announcement about the latest call for the fighters, but Defense News (www.defensenews.com) said on Sunday that Taiwan had been told there would be no sale, citing Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense.  “We are so disappointed in the United States,” the report quoted an unnamed Taiwan defense official as saying.  “A U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) delegation arrived here last week to deliver the news and offer instead a retrofit package for (Taiwan’s) older F-16A/Bs,” the journal reported from Taipei.  The proposed $4.2 billion upgrade package would make the 146 Taiwanese F-16A/Bs among the most capable variants of the aircraft, the report said.  The new gear would include an AESA radar, likely either Northrop Grumman’s Scalable Agile Beam Radar or the Raytheon Advanced Combat Radar, it said.  Any fresh U.S. arms support to Taiwan is likely to raise hackles in Beijing, but the advanced fighter jets have been an especially touchy point for China, which this week will host U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.  The bitter debate in the U.S. Congress over spending and the downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by Standard & Poor’s drew blunt criticism from China’s state media, including a commentary that said the U.S. debt woes reflected its military overreach abroad.  Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said it could not comment on the report, as it had not heard from the United States.  “However, we want to point out that the Republic of China (Taiwan) does hope the sale of new F-16C/D fighter aircraft will go through. We are in urgent need of the aircraft,” Spokesman Luo shou-he told Reuters.  The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979 and recognizes Beijing’s “one China” policy. But it is also Taiwan’s biggest ally and arms supplier and is duty-bound by legislation to help the island in the event of attack.  Washington had been set to make a decision by October on Taiwan’s oft-repeated request for the fighter jets, balancing its legal obligations to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act against the need to avoid upsets with a major creditor and trading partner, China.  “Frankly, it is not a real surprise. The real surprise is that they sold them the F-16s in the first place,” said Richard Bitzinger, a senior fellow and regional defense expert at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.  But Bitzinger said it was not a total victory for Beijing because a potential upgrade to existing fighters would go a long way in covering Taiwan’s loss of a new batch of F-16s.  “The types of upgrades they are talking about would make them the most advanced F-16s in the world.

The Army said it would update its “analysis of alternatives” for the vehicle and conduct separate technical and operational assessment of existing non-developmental vehicles.  Results from this assessment, along with contractors design efforts, will “facilitate a full and open competition for the next phase” of the program, the Army said.  The new ground combat vehicle will be the first designed from inception for battlefields characterized by roadside bombs, or improvised explosive devices, as the military calls them.

22,RTN,UAE said to trim planned US missile-defense purchase,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates has trimmed what had been billed as a possible $7 billion purchase of an advanced U.S. missile defense system but there are no major obstacles to its completion, Lockheed Martin Corp’s lead executive on the deal said Wednesday.  UAE officials have identified some elements of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense “that they think they can do without right now,” Dennis Cavin, a Lockheed vice president for missile defense programs, told Reuters.  The system would be designed to defend against ballistic missiles that could be fired by Iran, which is at odds with the West over its nuclear program.  Iran has test-fired missiles that it says are capable of hitting its arch foe, Israel, and U.S. bases in the Middle East.  The UAE would be the first overseas buyer of THAAD, the only system in any countries’ arsenal said to be capable of thwarting short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles both inside and outside the Earth’s atmosphere. Raytheon Co builds its radar.  Cavin said he now expected the UAE to sign a deal with the U.S. government for THAAD, as the Lockheed-built system is known, within a few months, later than he had previously projected.  “They have made some adjustments,” he told Reuters after updating reporters on the company’s missile defense programs along with three other Lockheed executives.  He declined to spell out the scope of the scaleback but said that “they haven’t cut in half the number of systems they’re buying.”  The contract will be worth less than the roughly $7 billion potential value cited in a formal notification to the U.S. Congress sent in September 2008, Cavin said. That notice said the UAE had requested three THAAD “fire units” with 147 THAAD missiles, four THAAD radar sets, six communications systems, nine launchers and related gear.  Cavin in a February 20 interview with Reuters during an arms bazaar in Abu Dhabi, had predicted that a government-to-government deal for the system would be completed last spring.  He told reporters Wednesday it was taking longer “but there has been no major hitch” in the negotiations with the UAE involving the U.S. government and an industry team.  “We’re making progress,” he said. A spokesman for the UAE embassy in Washington could not be reached immediately for comment.  The UAE’s purchase is expected to clear the way for a THAAD sale to Saudi Arabia, said Riki Ellison, who heads the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, a nonpartisan booster group.  Such overseas sales are making missile-defense systems more affordable for the United States, Cavin said.  Exports of Lockheed’s Patriot PAC-3 missiles, for instance, had reduced their costs to U.S. taxpayers by $482 million, or about 11 percent of the $4.2 billion spent on PAC-3 production since 2006, Craig Vanbebber, a Lockheed spokesman, said in an email to Reuters amplifying on Cavin’s remarks.

24,RTN,New version of missile interceptor fails first test,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new version of the SM-3 interceptor used in the U.S. ballistic missile defense program failed to hit a target in its first test on Thursday in an initial setback for its advanced steering systems.  The Missile Defense Agency said the interceptor — a Raytheon Standard Missile 3 Block 1B — was unable to achieve the intercept of a ballistic missile target during a test over the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii at 3:53 a.m.  The sea-based interceptor was fired from the USS Lake Erie at a short-range ballistic missile target that was launched from a Navy range on Kauai. The interceptor is a kinetic warhead designed to pulverize a target by smashing into it — like a bullet hitting a bullet.  “This was the first flight test of the advanced SM-3 Block 1B interceptor missile,” the agency said in a statement. “Program officials will conduct an extensive investigation to determine the cause of the failure to intercept.”  Rick Lehrner, a spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency, said the interceptor missile was being developed as part of the second stage of the Obama administration’s so-called “phased, adaptive approach” to missile defense in Europe.  Shortly after taking office, President Barack Obama scrapped his predecessor’s controversial plan to place ground-based interceptors in Poland and a related radar site in the Czech Republic.  President George W. Bush’s European missile defense plan had angered Russia and contributed to a chilling of ties with Moscow, which viewed the program as a threat to its nuclear deterrent.  Obama’s phased, adaptive approach called for the United States to initially deploy missile interceptors on ships in the Eastern Mediterranean or Black Sea. The second phase of the adaptive approach would include missile interceptors on ships as well as at a single site in Europe.  Lehrner said the new version of the SM-3 interceptor being developed for the second phase has improved pursuit and steering mechanisms.  “It has a more advanced ... attitude control system, which is kind of a steering mechanism for the interceptor. And it has a different ... seeker, which is a component of the interceptor that enables it to home in on the target,” he said.  The current version of the SM-3 — the SM-3 Block 1A — is deployed as part of the missile defense shield. It has had 22 successful intercepts out of 27 at-sea attempts since testing of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system began in 2002.  A modified version of that interceptor, also was used in the successful shootdown of a defunct U.S. spy satellite in February 2008.  The Pentagon said the unprecedented shootdown of the bus-sized satellite was aimed at destroying a load of hydrazine fuel that could have been released as a toxic gas if it had fallen to Earth.  But some security and space experts viewed the satellite’s downing as a U.S. response to China, which used a missile to destroy one of its own satellites a year earlier.

26,RTN,Raytheon looks to sell optics business: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor Raytheon Co (RTN.N) is looking to sell its precision optical systems business and has hired bankers to advise on the process, people familiar with the matter said.  Raytheon ELCAN Optical Technologies, which makes sighting systems for the military such as rifle sights and missile guidance systems, has about $30 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and could go for as much as $300 million, these people said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is running the auction process for the Raytheon business, according to the people.  Challenged by tightening global budgets and planned U.S. troop withdrawals from the Middle East, military contractors are moving to shed non-core divisions and acquire companies with niche technologies to enhance their growth prospects.  While the ELCAN subsidiary might not offer much growth within Raytheon in the face of softening military spending, potential buyers could boost growth by taking its technology and platform and expanding into adjacent, non-defense markets, the people said.  Raytheon’s ELCAN optics business joins two other optical component makers already on the auction block.  Photonis Group, owned by French private equity firm Astorg Partners, has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) to sell the company that could be worth about $700 million, people familiar with the matter told Reuters previously. Another French optical component maker, QioptiQ, is also looking for a buyer, the people had said.  The auction for the Raytheon business is likely to start in September after Labor Day, one of the people said, adding that it could draw interest from several U.S. defense companies like FLIR Systems Inc (FLIR.O).

30,RTN,Arms makers eye exports to offset Pentagon cuts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) political backers are stepping up a drive to meet Taiwan’s request for 66 new F-16 fighter jets, a sale that would help the Pentagon’s largest supplier weather possible cuts to its big-ticket weapons programs.  Such a sale, valued at more than $8 billion, would anger China, which deems self-ruled Taiwan a wayward province subject to unification by force if necessary.  Arms sales will be among the subjects explored at the annual Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington September 6-8. Company executives, Pentagon officials and analysts will discuss projected cuts in U.S. military spending that nearly doubled in the decade after the September 11, 2001, attacks.  Notwithstanding the possible harm to U.S.-China ties, nearly half of the 100 U.S. senators and 181 of the 435 members of the House of Representatives have urged President Barack Obama to move quickly to meet Taiwan’s F-16 request, informally pending since 2006.  “We are deeply concerned that further delay of the decision to sell F-16s to Taiwan could result in closure of the F-16 production line,” 45 senators said in a May 26 letter to Obama.  Economic arguments in favor of sensitive arms sales may gain traction as the U.S. jobless rate is stuck above 9 percent and campaigning for the 2012 elections is starting in earnest.  The Obama administration has begun consulting Congress on plans to sell Global Hawk spy planes made by Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) to South Korea, Reuters reported this week. This would require a waiver of the Missile Technology Control Regime, or MTCR, a voluntary arms control pact involving at least 34 countries.  Then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in October 2008 that the United States was “very sympathetic” to South Korea’s interest in the high-flying drone but that there were MTCR issues to overcome.  The Global Hawk’s range and payload capacity subject it to the pact created in 1987 to curb the spread of unmanned systems that could be used to deliver weapons of mass destruction.  The State Department declined to comment on a possible MTCR waiver pending formal notification of Congress of any such proposed Global Hawk sale.  Northrop Grumman Chief Executive Wes Bush complained in an August 17 speech that export curbs on unmanned systems were harming U.S. industry without making the United States any safer.  “The good news,” he said, “is that the Defense Department is promoting what is clearly the best export reform policy — build higher walls around fewer things.”  Arms sales to the Middle East, India and East Asia have always been freighted with diplomatic and political considerations, including maintaining balances of power.  Now they are increasingly important to U.S. and European arms makers preparing for security-related spending cuts sparked in part by an August 2 debt-ceiling deal between President Obama and Congress.  The Pentagon is trimming at least $350 billion from its previously projected spending through the next decade under that deal. Additional defense-related cuts of up to $600 billon are set to kick in if Congress fails by the end of the year to find at least $1.2 trillion more in deficit reduction over the same period — a “doomsday mechanism,” as current Defense Secretary Leon Panetta puts it.  Such cuts may mean there is not enough work to go around for Western firms, on top of a recent round of defense-related budget belt-tightening in Europe.  Foreign military sales are “clearly a way to grow to fill the revenue gap which is expected,” said Tom Captain, head of global aerospace and defense business at professional services company Deloitte.  Boeing Co (BA.N), the Pentagon’s No. 2 supplier by sales, is aiming to boost its defense, space and security-related sales toward 25 percent by 2015 from about 17 percent in 2010.  Defense unit Boeing Military Aircraft expects its foreign sales to account for as much as 40 percent of Boeing’s total warplane sales by the end of next year, up from 25 percent in 2010, said Jeffrey Kohler, a Boeing vice president for business development.  The Taiwan fighter-plane issue has been forced to a head in recent weeks by Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican on the Armed Services Committee.  Fort Worth, Texas, is home to the Lockheed Martin plant that assembles both the F-16 and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon’s costliest program, projected at more than $382 billion for more than 2,440 aircraft over the next two decades.  Cornyn used a senatorial privilege this summer to hold up consideration of President Obama’s choice of William Burns for deputy secretary of state, the State Department’s No. 2 job.  In exchange, he obtained Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s promise to say by October 1 what if anything the administration plans to do to boost Taiwan’s aging air force. Cornyn subsequently lifted his “hold” on Burns.  The Obama administration says no decision has been made yet on new F-16s for Taiwan. It has been mulling what it may view as a half-step — an upgrade of some or all of Taiwan’s 146 old F-16 A/B models that would include active electronically scanned array AESA radar built by either Northrop Grumman or Raytheon Co (RTN.N).  “The administration’s decision will not be the final word there,” Cornyn said last month after touring the production lines in Fort Worth. That facility, he said, represented about 15,000 jobs and a boon to the local economy.  Cornyn said he was weighing the possibility of mandating the sale of new F-16s to Taiwan, for instance as an amendment to the annual defense authorization bill expected to reach the Senate floor in October or November.  The senator has another point of leverage. He could put another “hold” on a top Obama nominee: Ashton Carter, the Pentagon’s top arms buyer and Obama’s choice to be the next deputy secretary of defense.  “We’ll wait and see what the administration does, but I think we’re not without fallback positions or other remedies,” Cornyn told reporters in an August 23 teleconference.  He followed up the next day with a warning about Lockheed’s F-35 program to Carter, who is preparing for a September 13 nomination hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.  “I strongly encourage you to step up your defense of this key program,” he told Carter.  In a report commissioned by Lockheed Martin, the Perryman Group, a Waco, Texas, economic research and analysis firm, said in June that a Taiwan F-16 program would be “a notable source of economic stimulus” for the sputtering U.S. economy.  The project would generate $8.7 billion in output, almost $768 million in federal tax revenue and more than 87,660 “person-years” of employment, the report said. Laura Siebert, a Lockheed spokeswoman, disclosed that the report had been commissioned by Lockheed in response to a query from Reuters.  If the company does not get a new F-16 production order by the end of December, it will need to start notifying suppliers in a prelude to shutting down the line, she said.

32,RTN,U.S. faces tough choices on defense budget,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ten years after the United States embarked on a war against terrorism in the rubble of the September 11 attacks, the country finds itself financially exhausted and facing hard strategic choices as it grapples with new budget realities.  After spending heavily for a decade on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Pentagon now faces potential cuts of up to nearly $1 trillion over 10 years at a time when it sees rising competition from countries like China and a need to replace its fleet of aging planes and ships.  While some lawmakers are promising to act to avert the heaviest of the budget cuts, Todd Harrison, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, says postwar cost-cutting of 25 percent to 50 percent has been the norm since the Korean War. That means something has to give.  “Given the budget outlook we see in the coming years, it’s simply not realistic for DoD (Department of Defense) to continue to do all of the things it does today with fewer and fewer resources,” Harrison told a briefing this week on the impact of the September 11 attacks.  “This means we will need to make a number of strategic choices about how and where we plan to compete in the future,” he said. “And these choices will have to be constrained by the resources available.”  As the United States marks the 10th anniversary of the attacks on New York and Washington, analysts say September 11 and the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have had a profound impact on the way the Pentagon fights and views the threats it is likely to face in the future.  “I think for the Department of Defense it (September 11) really was a watershed event,” said Jim Thomas, another analyst with the CSBA. “I don’t think it struck people immediately ... but as we look at the cumulative effect over the past decade, I think we can say in retrospect that it truly was.”  In Iraq and Afghanistan, the military has increasingly emphasized shadowy special operations strikes instead of major set-piece battles.  With less than 1 percent of the population in uniform, the United States went to war undermanned and backed by an army of defense contractors, a move that has cemented close ties between the industry and the military.  “It had a profound effect,” Northrop Grumman Corp Chief Executive Wes Bush said of the September 11 attacks. “And it had a profound effect in many dimensions.”  The rush of patriotism that followed the attacks led many young college graduates to seek careers in the defense industry, reshaping the demographics of companies like Northrop, Bush told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit this week.  “Many of our employees spend every day working side by side with service members,” Bush said. “(September 11) has, I would say, increased the sense of shared mission, shared responsibility.”  The attacks also marked a shift in U.S. economic fortunes. Before al Qaeda operatives slammed hijacked planes into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon near Washington, budget officials had projected surpluses that would have virtually eliminated the federal debt over the course of the decade.  Instead, tax cuts and war spending led Washington to rack up a string of deficits that have added $6.1 trillion to the national debt, pushing it to $14.3 trillion, or about $46,500 for every man, woman and child in the country.  Pentagon spending over the decade rose from about $400 billion annually to nearly $700 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars, even though the overall size of the armed forces remained roughly the same, Harrison said.  In addition to war spending, the Pentagon paid more for personnel and saw the cost of its day-to-day operations rise. The services also spent $50 billion on developing weapons systems that were never actually produced.  “We canceled programs knowing that we will need to start a replacement program to do essentially the same thing,” Harrison said. “Now, we will have fewer resources available in the coming years to do that.”  Under the debt-reduction agreement signed by President Barack Obama in August, the Defense Department is working to cut $350 billion from its projected spending over the next 10 years.  The Pentagon could face another $600 billion in automatic across-the-board spending cuts unless a congressional supercommittee agrees on alternatives by the end of the year to reduce the federal deficit.  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and the Pentagon’s top uniformed personnel have warned that the first round of cuts is proving difficult. A second round would be disastrous, they say, and would increase the risk to national security.  Defense industry leaders acknowledge the need for some cuts in defense spending, but they warn that in the current tough economic environment, reductions will jeopardize the jobs and innovation needed for further growth and expansion.  “We understand the urgency of wanting to focus on reducing deficits that exceed a trillion dollars,” Lockheed Martin Corp Chief Executive Robert Stevens told the Reuters Summit. “Our preference would be that we align national security resources to national security challenges and not have it a function of an automatic budget reduction.”  ",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aero-arms-summit-budget/u-s-faces-tough-choices-on-defense-budget-idUSTRE7885VZ20110909

36,RTN,Bigger firms seen in next defense consolidation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) interest in acquiring Goodrich Corp GR.N marks the start of a more active consolidation phase in the U.S. aerospace and defense industry that could ultimately winnow the current field of five or six prime contractors.  Industry executives expect more takeovers of second- and third-tier defense suppliers in coming months and say there could even be changes in the top tier, depending on the depth of defense spending cuts mandated by U.S. budget deficits.  For years, experts ruled out further consolidation among the biggest arms makers after the mega-mergers sparked by the end of the Cold War. But the prospect of deep spending cuts and continued pressure on companies to generate profits have revived the specter of bigger mergers.  Deals in recent years have been smaller, punctuated only by the $5 billion takeover of U.S. defense contractor DRS Technologies by Italy’s Finmeccanica SpA SIFI.MI in 2008.  If United Tech prevails in its bid to acquire Goodrich — a deal likely valued at around $12 billion — that would probably be the harbinger of other large deals.  “This changes the whole spectrum,” said one senior defense industry executive. “Everything’s on the table now. I’m not saying it’s going to happen, but it’s a whole new ballgame.”  Another senior executive agreed, saying, “This feels like the early 1990s again. We’re in for some turbulent times.”  The biggest companies in the U.S. defense market are Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), Boeing Co (BA.N), Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Raytheon Co (RTN.N), as well as Britain’s BAE Systems (BAES.L).  After a decade of sharp growth in defense spending, the U.S. Defense Department is now scrambling to cut at least $350 billion from previous spending projections, and that could rise to $900 billion unless Congress finds at least $1.2 trillion in deficit cuts by year-end.  Budget pressures have already scaled back new weapons programs, and lawmakers have taken aim at additional projects in recent weeks — leaving less work for defense companies to divvy up. Many companies have shifted into services, and that trend will continue. Others are looking to diversify into more commercial work to offset the drop in government orders.  “You have a lot of defense companies that are cash-rich and are looking at ways to move into adjacent areas; it’s possible that they would expand what they do in commercial aerospace,” said Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis for the Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy in Fairfax, Virginia.  Defense Undersecretary Ashton Carter and other officials had tried for the past year to assure industry executives that they would be able to stave off big spending cuts.  But those hopes have been overtaken by a new reality, said defense analyst Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute. “What Secretary Carter told the defense industry about its future prospects just isn’t panning out,” he said.  Brett Lambert, deputy assistant secretary of defense, manufacturing and industrial base policy, this month acknowledged the toll that uncertainty was taking on the sector.  Given the difficult economic climate, the Defense Department fully expects more mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs in coming years, mostly in the supplier base, Lambert told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington.  While the Pentagon was comfortable with the current number of prime contractors, it was not “ruling anything out,” he said.  Adam Palmer, who manages aerospace and defense investments for the Carlyle Group private equity firm, told Reuters that defense officials might rethink their opposition to big mergers if spending cuts gut the market for certain types of weapons.  Carter, nominated for the No. 2 job at the Defense Department, is no stranger to defense consolidation, having attended the 1993 “Last Supper” where his friend and mentor, then-Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry, urged arms makers to consolidate.  Carter often talks about that experience in public speeches, and he says the department has a responsibility to pay attention to the impact of its decisions on the industrial base, especially given the slowdown in defense spending.  Thompson does not expect mergers at the top tier, but he says there will clearly be contraction in defense electronics. He said companies such as Harris Corp (HRS.N) and ITT (ITT.N), which plans to spin off its defense unit, are probably more vulnerable to takeovers than bigger players such as Northrop and Raytheon.  “It’s going to be a big change, but I don’t think there’ll be a ‘Last Supper’ in the sense that the DoD (Department of Defense) will tell everybody what they expect and what needs to be done and companies will go do that,” said Norm Augustine, former chief executive of Lockheed, who attended the Perry event.  John Young, who served as the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer before Carter, warned that further consolidation would likely increase already high prices of new weapons.

37,RTN,Bigger firms seen in next US defense consolidation," * Defense firms eye opportunities in commercial arena   * Spending cuts could prompt changes at top-tier players   * Former arms buyer calls for policies against big mergers   By Andrea Shalal-Esa   WASHINGTON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) interest in acquiring Goodrich Corp GR.N marks the start of a more active consolidation phase in the U.S. aerospace and defense industry that could ultimately winnow the current field of five or six prime contractors.   Industry executives expect more takeovers of second- and third-tier defense suppliers in coming months and say there could even be changes in the top tier, depending on the depth of defense spending cuts mandated by U.S. budget deficits.   For years, experts ruled out further consolidation among the biggest arms makers after the mega-mergers sparked by the end of the Cold War. But the prospect of deep spending cuts and continued pressure on companies to generate profits have revived the specter of bigger mergers.   Deals in recent years have been smaller, punctuated only by the $5 billion takeover of U.S. defense contractor DRS Technologies by Italy’s Finmeccanica SpA SIFI.MI in 2008.   If United Tech prevails in its bid to acquire Goodrich — a deal likely valued at around $12 billion — that would probably be the harbinger of other large deals.   “This changes the whole spectrum,” said one senior defense industry executive. “Everything’s on the table now. I’m not saying it’s going to happen, but it’s a whole new ballgame.”   Another senior executive agreed, saying, “This feels like the early 1990s again. We’re in for some turbulent times.”   The biggest companies in the U.S. defense market are Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), Boeing Co (BA.N), Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Raytheon Co (RTN.N), as well as Britain’s BAE Systems (BAES.L).   After a decade of sharp growth in defense spending, the U.S. Defense Department is now scrambling to cut at least $350 billion from previous spending projections, and that could rise to $900 billion unless Congress finds at least $1.2 trillion in deficit cuts by year-end.   Budget pressures have already scaled back new weapons programs, and lawmakers have taken aim at additional projects in recent weeks — leaving less work for defense companies to divvy up. Many companies have shifted into services, and that trend will continue. Others are looking to diversify into more commercial work to offset the drop in government orders.   “You have a lot of defense companies that are cash-rich and are looking at ways to move into adjacent areas; it’s possible that they would expand what they do in commercial aerospace,” said Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis for the Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy in Fairfax, Virginia.   Defense Undersecretary Ashton Carter and other officials had tried for the past year to assure industry executives that they would be able to stave off big spending cuts.   But those hopes have been overtaken by a new reality, said defense analyst Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute. “What Secretary Carter told the defense industry about its future prospects just isn’t panning out,” he said.   Brett Lambert, deputy assistant secretary of defense, manufacturing and industrial base policy, this month acknowledged the toll that uncertainty was taking on the sector.   Given the difficult economic climate, the Defense Department fully expects more mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs in coming years, mostly in the supplier base, Lambert told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington.   While the Pentagon was comfortable with the current number of prime contractors, it was not “ruling anything out,” he said.   Adam Palmer, who manages aerospace and defense investments for the Carlyle Group private equity firm, told Reuters that defense officials might rethink their opposition to big mergers if spending cuts gut the market for certain types of weapons.   Carter, nominated for the No. 2 job at the Defense Department, is no stranger to defense consolidation, having attended the 1993 “Last Supper” where his friend and mentor, then-Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry, urged arms makers to consolidate.   Carter often talks about that experience in public speeches, and he says the department has a responsibility to pay attention to the impact of its decisions on the industrial base, especially given the slowdown in defense spending.   Thompson does not expect mergers at the top tier, but he says there will clearly be contraction in defense electronics. He said companies such as Harris Corp (HRS.N) and ITT (ITT.N), which plans to spin off its defense unit, are probably more vulnerable to takeovers than bigger players such as Northrop and Raytheon.   “It’s going to be a big change, but I don’t think there’ll be a ‘Last Supper’ in the sense that the DoD (Department of Defense) will tell everybody what they expect and what needs to be done and companies will go do that,” said Norm Augustine, former chief executive of Lockheed, who attended the Perry event.   John Young, who served as the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer before Carter, warned that further consolidation would likely increase already high prices of new weapons.   He said defense officials should adopt strict policies against any mergers that create monopolies, while easing tough auditing rules and other barriers that keep more innovative companies and nontraditional suppliers out of the market.   “The truth is that if (the bigger firms) shed some overhead and closed some plants, they would be better positioned for the next upward cycle in the defense budget,” Young said.   Jacques Gansler, who headed Pentagon procurement under former President Bill Clinton, agreed, saying the department also needs to allow more competition throughout weapons programs instead of handing contracts to one supplier.   “They don’t understand how competition works,” he said. “Monopolies tend to raise prices, not lower them.”  (Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; additional reporting by Karen Jacobs; editing by John Wallace)   ",9202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/defense-consolidation/bigger-firms-seen-in-next-us-defense-consolidation-idUSS1E78I1I420110920

42,RTN,China warns against U.S. F-16 upgrade for Taiwan,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The Obama administration told the U.S. Congress on Wednesday that it planned a $5.3 billion upgrade of Taiwan’s F-16 fighter fleet, angering Beijing but disappointing new arms-sales advocates.  China condemned the retrofit of Lockheed Martin Corp F-16 A/Bs sold in 1992 as a “grave interference” in its internal affairs and warned that it will damage military and security ties with the United States.  In January 2010, China froze military-to-military ties and threatened sanctions against U.S. arms makers after President Barack Obama approved a potential $6.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan left over from the administration of George W. Bush, including Black Hawk helicopters, Patriot anti-missile missiles and two refurbished Osprey-class mine-hunting ships.  The upgrade of the 145 F-16s will give them essentially the same capabilities as late-model F-16 C/Ds that Taiwan has sought for five years without success, U.S. officials said. They said Taiwan would get the capability sooner and cheaper, a point of contention with advocates of new F-16s.  The administration also notified Congress that it planned a five-year, $500 million extension of F-16 pilot training at Luke Air Force Base and to sell $52 million in spare parts for Taiwan’s F-16s, F-5s, and C-130s. All together, the potential sales total $5.85 billion.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Taiwan was an “internal matter” that affected China’s territorial integrity and the national feelings of 1.3 billion Chinese people.  “China urges the U.S. to clearly understand the acute sensitivity and serious harmfulness of selling arms to Taiwan, and to treat China’s solemn stance seriously,” Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun said.  Beijing deems Taiwan a renegade province and sees U.S. arms sales to the self-ruled island as the top obstacle to improved ties between the United States and China, now the world’s two biggest economies.  China has shown no sign of ending an arms build-up that is focused on Taiwan. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.  Taiwan’s military supply options are limited to the United States, with other countries refusing to sell it weapons, fearing an angry Chinese response.  In Taipei, Taiwan’s defense ministry said the F-16 upgrade will contribute to regional peace by improving its defense capability in the face of what it called a continued threat from China.  Taiwan would continue to press for newer F-16s to replace its F-5 fighters that are more than 30 years old, the ministry said in a statement.  The retrofit will provide a substantial increase in the survivability, reliability and combat capabilities of the F-16A/Bs, said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.  “This will help ensure that Taiwan maintains the capability to protect its airspace in both peacetime and during any crisis,” she said in a statement.  The United States firmly believes that its arms sales to Taiwan contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, Nuland added in a statement.  Taiwan’s request for new F-16s remains under consideration, Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary of state for the region, said at a news conference in New York.  The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, whose members include arms maker Lockheed Martin, said the correct approach would be to have both programs running sequentially, so that new F-16 C/Ds would be delivered to Taiwan before it starts pulling front-line F-16 A/Bs out of operations.  “As presently structured, Taiwan will actually see a reduction in the number of operational F-16s over the next 10 years,” council president Rupert Hammond-Chambers said.  The Pentagon said in its notice to Congress that Taiwan had requested 176 state-of-the-art Active Electronically Scanned Array, or AESA, radar sets, in addition to a long list of advanced air-to-air missiles, laser- and GPS-guided bombs and other weapons systems for its F-16 fleet.  AESA radar “offers a significant capability that would be able to maintain Taiwan’s qualitative advantage” over currently deployed Chinese fighters, said Mark Stokes, a former Pentagon China desk chief who heads the Project 2049 Institute, an Asia security research group.  Raytheon Co and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) are expected to compete to supply the AESA radar sets.  The deal also would include 140 of the latest version of heat-seeking Raytheon AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles and 128 Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing systems, which let pilots fire on targets from multiple angles without turning their heads or the plane.  In the U.S. Congress, 47 of the 100 U.S. senators and 181 of the 435 members of the House of Representatives have written to President Barack Obama since May to urge him to sell Taiwan the 66 late-model F-16 C/D planes it has sought since 2006.  The Obama administration is required by law to notify Congress of any proposed major arms sale. The sale may go ahead after 30 days unless Congress enacts a joint resolution blocking it in the allotted time.  Senator John Cornyn has proposed mandating the sale of at least 66 new F-16 C/D fighters to Taiwan as an amendment to legislation now being considered on the Senate floor.  Cornyn is a Republican from Texas, where Lockheed Martin manufactures the F-16. He said in a floor speech that Congress should pass his bill because, he said, China “respects only strength, not weakness.” He has emphasized the jobs that building new planes would bring and the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which requires the U.S. government to provide Taiwan sufficient arms for its defense.  Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney deplored Obama’s refusal to sell Taiwan new jets as “yet another example of his weak leadership in foreign policy.”  ",9212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan/china-warns-against-u-s-f-16-upgrade-for-taiwan-idUSTRE78K70420110921

The United States firmly believes that its arms sales to Taiwan contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, Nuland added in a statement.   Taiwan’s request for new F-16s remains under consideration, Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary of state for the region, said at a news conference in New York.   The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, whose members include arms maker Lockheed Martin, said the correct approach would be to have both programs running sequentially, so that new F-16 C/Ds would be delivered to Taiwan before it starts pulling front-line F-16 A/Bs out of operations.   “As presently structured, Taiwan will actually see a reduction in the number of operational F-16s over the next 10 years,” council president Rupert Hammond-Chambers said.   The Pentagon said in its notice to Congress that Taiwan had requested 176 state-of-the-art Active Electronically Scanned Array, or AESA, radar sets, in addition to a long list of advanced air-to-air missiles, laser- and GPS-guided bombs and other weapons systems for its F-16 fleet.    AESA radar “offers a significant capability that would be able to maintain Taiwan’s qualitative advantage” over currently deployed Chinese fighters, said Mark Stokes, a former Pentagon China desk chief who heads the Project 2049 Institute, an Asia security research group.   Raytheon Co (RTN.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) are expected to compete to supply the AESA radar sets.   The deal also would include 140 of the latest version of heat-seeking Raytheon AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles and 128 Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing systems, which let pilots fire on targets from multiple angles without turning their heads or the plane.   In the U.S. Congress, 47 of the 100 U.S. senators and 181 of the 435 members of the House of Representatives have written to President Barack Obama since May to urge him to sell Taiwan the 66 late-model F-16 C/D planes it has sought since 2006.   The Obama administration is required by law to notify Congress of any proposed major arms sale. The sale may go ahead after 30 days unless Congress enacts a joint resolution blocking it in the allotted time.   Senator John Cornyn has proposed mandating the sale of at least 66 new F-16 C/D fighters to Taiwan as an amendment to legislation now being considered on the Senate floor.   Cornyn is a Republican from Texas, where Lockheed Martin manufactures the F-16. He said in a floor speech that Congres should pass his bill because, he said, China “respects only strength, not weakness.” He has emphasized the jobs that building new planes would bring and the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which requires the U.S. government to provide Taiwan sufficient arms for its defense.   Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney deplored Obama’s refusal to sell Taiwan new jets as “yet another example of his weak leadership in foreign policy.”  (Additional reporting by Jonathan Standing and Christine Lu in Taipei; Ben Blanchard in Beijing, Susan Cornwell in Washington, Paul Eckert in New York; Editing by Anthony Boadle)   ",9212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-taiwan/update-3-china-warns-against-u-s-f-16-upgrade-for-taiwan-idUSS1E78K1GC20110921

China warned that the potential $5.3 billion U.S. arms sale will harm its “core interests” in Taiwan and damage China-U.S. military and security cooperation.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Taiwan was an “internal matter” that affected China’s territorial integrity and the national feelings of 1.3 billion Chinese people.  “China urges the U.S. to clearly understand the acute sensitivity and serious harmfulness of selling arms to Taiwan, and to treat China’s solemn stance seriously,” Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun said.

45,RTN,UPDATE 1-China curbs military ties after U.S. arms sale to Taiwan," (Adds details, quotes)	   BEIJING, Sept 22 (Reuters) - China on Thursday condemned the United States for its latest arms sales offer to Taiwan, calling the decision “grave interference” in Chinese internal affairs and warning it will damage U.S. military and security ties with Beijing.	   Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun voiced China’s “strong indignation and resolute opposition” to the sale of F-16 fighter upgrades and other military equipment when he called in the U.S. Ambassador to Beijing, Gary Locke, the ministry’s website (www.mfa.gov.cn) reported.	   “No matter what the excuses and reasons, there can be no hiding that United States’ announcement of plans to sell arms to Taiwan is grave interference in China’s domestic affairs and sends a gravely mistaken signal to pro-Taiwan independence separatist forces,” said Zhang.	   “It must be pointed out that this wrongful course by the U.S. side will unavoidably damage Sino-American relations and cooperation and exchanges in the military, security and other fields,” said Zhang.	   He warned Washington “not to take any more actions that harm China’s core interests and bilateral cooperation.”	   Tensions over the latest U.S. arms sales to Taiwan now appear likely to cloud Sino-U.S. relations for a while after the announcement. Beijing’s comments indicated that military ties will be reined in, as they have been after previous sales.	   Last year, such arms sales were among a clutch of disputes that strained ties between China and the United States.	   China deems self-governed Taiwan to be an illegitimate breakaway from mainland rule and has vowed to secure eventual reunification. The United States ended formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan when Washington recognised Beijing in 1979, but says it is obliged by law to help Taiwan defend itself.	   “We urge the U.S. side to fully grasp the acute sensitivity and grave harmfulness of weapons sales to Taiwan, and truly respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said in a separate statement on the arms sales.	   The Obama administration formally notified the U.S. Congress on Wednesday of a potential $5.3 billion upgrade of Taiwan’s aging fleet of U.S.-built F-16 fighter jets, which U.S. officials have said will give them much the same capabilities as late-model F-16 C/Ds that Taiwan had sought without success.	   The Pentagon said Taiwan had also requested 176 state-of-the-art radar sets and advanced air-to-air missiles, laser- and GPS-guided bombs and other weapons systems for the F-16s.	   China has shown no sign of ending an arms build-up that is focused on Taiwan, and past U.S. arms sales to Taipei have riled Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.	   Taiwan, which for years relied on better equipment and training, has been hobbled by the refusal of any country other than the United States to sell it weapons, fearing an angry response from China.  	   The military advantage Taiwan once boasted in the air has slipped away over the past decade as China modernised, and analysts say the arms deal would do little to alter the balance.  	   In January 2010, China froze military-to-military ties and threatened sanctions against U.S. firms after President Barack Obama approved a potential $6.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan left over from the administration of George W. Bush.	   Still, relations between China and Taiwan have warmed considerably since Ma Ying-jeou was elected the island’s president in 2008 and who has since signed a series of landmark economic and trade deals with Beijing.

There was no immediate reaction to the U.S. announcement from Beijing.   But in comments posted earlier on Wednesday on the website of the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, a People’s Liberation Army major general said the United States had withheld from selling new F-16 jets “because it foresaw a strong reaction from mainland China.”   “It was wise for President Obama not to approve selling F-16 C/Ds to Taiwan, but approving the upgrades of the F-16s was totally in error,” Major General Luo Yuan said.   “The United States is trying to swindle and bamboozle the Chinese people by using a new guise for old tricks in selling weapons to Taiwan, and China should copy Russia in implementing smart retaliation,” Luo was reported as saying.   China has shown no sign of ending an arms build-up that is focused on Taiwan.

52,RTN,"U.S. sees China fallout from Taiwan arms, no breach","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States expects some fraying of relations with China over its $5.3 billion plan to upgrade Taiwan’s F-16 fleet but not as “shrill” a reaction as if it had met the request for new fighter jets, the top U.S. military commander in the region told Reuters on Friday.  China has condemned the planned retrofit of Taiwan’s 145 F-16 A/B fighters sold in 1992. But it has not yet announced any retaliatory steps.  “We anticipate that there will be effects as a consequence of this. We aren’t sure what those details will be,” Admiral Robert Willard, head of the U.S. military’s Pacific Command, said in an interview.  “Several of us have standing invitations to China later in the year and we’ll see what happens. I’ve been canceled before.”  China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province subject to unification with the mainland by force if necessary.  The U.S. offer to Taiwan includes sales of advanced air-to-air missiles, guided bombs and sophisticated radar equipment.  “I’m certain that had there been any sales over and above what this Taiwan arms sales package contained that the response would have been more shrill,” Willard said.  China’s People’s Liberation Army suspended ties with the U.S. military for most of 2010 after the previous, $6.4 billion U.S. arms package for Taiwan, adding to tensions that have included U.S. pressure on China to loosen controls on its currency.  Willard played down the prospects of such fallout from the $5.85 billion arms package that Congress was formally notified of on Wednesday, including a five-year, $500 million extension of training for Taiwan’s F-16 pilots, and spare parts.  He cited a conversation he said he had with a senior Chinese general the day before the long-anticipated announcement of the arms sale. General Fan Changlong, Jinan region military commander, had been visiting Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii.  “We talked about a range of issues and as always Taiwan and Taiwan arms sales came up in the course of the meeting. But it came up in a pretty professional way and he didn’t dwell on it much,” Willard said.  Asked whether he expected any major rupture, Willard said, “I think the Chinese are likely to continue to try and maintain the appropriate level of dialogue between the two nations — at least I would hope they’d do that.”  “Because it’s in our best interests and I think they recognize the value of that as well,” he said.  The United States switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1979. But it is obligated by the Taiwan Relations Act to supply the self-ruled island sufficient arms for its defense.  Since 2006, Taiwan has requested 66 F-16C/D models, which have a more advanced engine and combat capability than the pre-upgrade A/B models. It has sought the upgrades as well to help deter any Chinese attack.  Willard rejected any suggestion Washington withheld the new aircraft in deference to Beijing. The arms package was significant, he said, even though he described it as unlikely to tip the cross-Strait power balance in Taiwan’s favor.  “If you look at the amassed combat power cross-Strait and what’s essentially pointing at Taiwan today, there’s a pretty large delta there that I don’t think these kind of defense articles that are being provided in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act is going to overcome,” he said.  The Pentagon, in its latest report to Congress last month, said the China-Taiwan balance of military force “continues to shift in Beijing’s favor.” China had up to 1,200 short-range ballistic missiles deployed to units opposite Taiwan as of last December, it said.

53,RTN,China foreign minister warns Clinton on F-16 deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - China’s foreign minister urged the United States on Monday to reconsider its decision to upgrade Taiwan’s F-16 jet fighter fleet, saying it could harm ties between Washington and Beijing, a U.S. official said.  Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi delivered the warning to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a one-hour meeting in New York on the sidelines of the U.N.

55,RTN,Boeing says Japan could produce F-18 under license,"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. planemaker Boeing (BA.N) said local defense contractors might build F/A 18 Super Hornets under license if Japan chose to buy the next-generation fighter jet.  The comment came after the U.S. aerospace giant, along with Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and a consortium of European countries, submitted bids to produce Japan’s next mainstay combat aircraft in a deal that could be worth up to $8 billion.  Japan, which is facing a resurgent China and its growing military as well as threats from North Korea, plans to decide this year how it will replace its current fleet of aging F-4 Phantom fighters with about 40 new combat airplanes.  Phillip Mills, Director of Boeing’s Japan FX Capture Team, said Japanese makers could supply about three quarters of Super Hornet components if Japan opted for the fighter jet.  There has been great interest in how much of next-generation fighter jet-related jobs will be outsourced to the Japanese industry, which has been battered by gradual but consistent shrinkage of the defense budget.  “If you came to the Boeing production line, everything you saw Boeing doing in St Louis would be available or is available for Japan industry to do,” Mills told Reuters in an interview.  “It’s clear that we are going to be somewhere in the 75 percent area,” Mills added, referring the percentage of F-18 component production that the company could outsource to Japanese makers.  Japanese fighter jet and aeroplane components makers include top defense contractor Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T) and IHI (7013.T).  Boeing’s F/A 18 Super Hornet is set to compete against Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the Eurofighter Typhoon made by a consortium of European countries for the contract.  Mills said the high rate of planned outsourcing to Japanese companies, competitive pricing and ability to deliver on time give Boeing a competitive edge against the competition.  “The lower risk and affordability and licensed production we are offering is, I think, as good as they are going to get . so all and all we are feeling pretty good about it,” he said.  “We’ve offered an extremely fair and competitive price for not only initial aircraft but also for licensed production aircraft.” said Mills.  He declined to specify the offer price.  Kazuya Sakamoto, professor at Japan’s Osaka University, said the Lockheed Martin F-35’s stealth, or radar-evading, capability gives it an advantage over the competition, although its cost overruns and schedule slips have cast doubts over its prospects.  Fighter jets’ stealth capability has drawn heavy attention in Japan since China, which has a long-running territorial dispute with Japan, in January confirmed it had held its first test flight of the J-20 stealth fighter jet.  Mills said Boeing’s multi-role Super Hornet comes with a stealth capability, but the rival F-35 is “stealthier.”  Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defense contractor, which also submitted its proposal to Japan earlier on Monday said the F-35 stealth jets would deliver “unmatched cost-effective capability for Japan’s defense, now and well into the future.”  “We are committed to an enduring F-35 partnership with Japanese industry to deliver F-35’s transformational 5th generation capability for Japan’s long-term national security,” John Balderston, Director of the Japan F-35 Campaign, said in a statement.  Meanwhile, a consortium of European companies that makes the Eurofighter Tyhpoon said that fighter jet could be manufactured, maintained or integrated in Japan under license and that the aircraft’s crucial data and software source code could also be handed out to Japan.  Some media reports have said U.S. makers have a better chance of winning the deal since Japan may shy away from picking European fighter jets out of fear that doing so could further ruffle its U.S. ties, already hurt by disputes over the relocation of the U.S. Marines’ airbase in southern Japan.  Meanwhile, the head of U.S. military forces in Asia and the Pacific predicted that Japan’s choice of a new multibillion-dollar fighter fleet would reflect plans to stay “very complementary” with U.S. air forces.

57,RTN,Some fear cuts may hurt US defense industry base," * Factories, jobs, expertise potentially at risk   * Other analysts say concerns overblown   By David Alexander   WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - When the British Royal Navy decided to build a new class of nuclear attack submarines in 1997, it wasted years before discovering its shipbuilding industry no longer had the design and production skills to finish the job.   Prime contractor BAE Systems ultimately turned to the U.S. Navy’s main submarine builder, General Dynamics Electric Boat (GD.N), to provide the expertise the United Kingdom had lost due to Cold War defense cuts and changing technologies.   Some analysts see the story of the HMS Astute, which was formally commissioned one year ago, as a cautionary tale about what could happen to the Pentagon unless the U.S. government protects critical elements of the defense industry as it begins to cut hundreds of billions in spending over the next decade.   “If we end up in this situation ... exactly who are we going to go to? The Chinese? The Russians?” asked Barry Watts, a defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank. “You don’t want to end up here.”   It is not an empty concern. Even before President Barack Obama and Congress agreed on a deal that could reduce defense spending by as much as $1 trillion over 10 years, the United States already had lost some significant capabilities.   Back in 2008, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his Energy Department counterpart, Samuel Bodman, said the United States could no longer make nuclear bombs.   “While the service lives of existing warhead types are being extended through refurbishment, at present the United States does not have the ability to produce new nuclear weapons,” they wrote in a paper on the U.S. nuclear deterrent.   The loss of that capacity was one issue that drove Republican demands for more U.S. nuclear modernization funding during last December’s debate over the New START nuclear weapons treaty with Russia.   Other U.S. capabilities are on the edge. Cutbacks at NASA have put U.S. production of solid fuel rocket engines at risk, said Tom Captain, head of the aerospace and defense unit Deloitte LLP. The dwindling number of military jet projects is threatening competition in the engine market, he said.   In today’s budget climate, the health of the defense industrial base is suddenly in the spotlight. But some are skeptical of the dire warnings, seeing them as an excuse for sparing defense budgets that have expanded enormously in the last decade.   “To my mind there’s just a fantastic amount of hyperventilating about this issue,” said Gordon Adams, an American University professor who oversaw defense budgets at the White House during the post-Cold War military build-down.   “Every time, people come out of the woodwork and start tearing their hair and rending their garments. And every time, at the end of a build-down we end up with the world’s dominant military force and technology that is generations ahead of anybody else,” he said. “So it’s kind of like crying wolf.”   Adams said only the top six or seven U.S. defense contractors, like Lockheed (LMT.N), Raytheon (RTN.N) and Northrop Grumman (NOC.N), are dependent on the U.S. Defense Department for 75 percent or more of their revenues. The second- and third-tier firms, he said, are well-diversified between defense and commercial work.   Critical engineering and design skills would be fairly safe at smaller firms because they can switch from defense to commercial work in lean times, he said.   “Anybody who says $1 trillion (in spending reductions) is the end of Western civilization doesn’t understand that $1 trillion is just 16 percent of (the Defense Department’s) projected resources,” Adams said. “Properly managed, it’s a cake walk.”   So far Obama and Congress have approved $350 billion in reductions to national security spending. If a congressional “super committee” fails to reach a deficit deal by year-end, automatic across-the-board cuts could take another $600 billion from security spending.   Those cuts, analysts said, could lead to a loss of capabilities. Once the skill and know-how to produce a sophisticated defense system is lost, it is difficult and expensive to reconstitute.   While it is “technically and physically” possible to rebuild part of the industrial base once it has been allowed to die, outgoing Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen said, the reality is “it doesn’t come back.”   “People go away, skills go away and the enormity of the investment to bring it back if you’ve got that wrong, it’s not going to be there,” Mullen told a business group.   Given the potential size of the coming defense spending cuts, some analysts say the United States could lose strategically important people and technologies unless it effectively manages the build-down.   Captain estimated that if the Pentagon is forced to implement the full $1 trillion in spending cuts, then the defense industry could see the loss of some 160,000 jobs.   “By reducing the defense budget, it’s actually cutting jobs, a very significant number of high-paying jobs,” he said.   But in the current economic climate, with unemployment over 9 percent and U.S. budget deficits running at some $1.3 trillion annually, there is little public sympathy for going deeper in the hole just to keep big defense contractors flush with new projects so they can retain their engineers.   That’s not what the industry wants or expects, said Mark Valerio, who deals with space and satellite technologies as vice president of Lockheed Martin Surveillance and Navigation Systems.   “We fully understand the current budget environment and would not advocate for government funding solely for the purpose of keeping an engineering workforce engaged,” he said in an email.   In an era of few new satellite and space projects, there are still things the government can do to help industry, such as upgrading products and stabilizing project spending so that it does not fluctuate widely from year to year.   But Watts, and his CSBA colleague Todd Harrison, said companies would ultimately have difficulty justifying continued spending on high-priced assets — like a cadre of top engineers — if they are not regularly engaged in new programs.   Watts said when he worked at Northrop Grumman in the late 1990s the company determined that it cost about $100 million annually to maintain a state-of-the-art design team for advanced combat aircraft.   “If you’re not getting most of that money from a program say like the JSF (Joint Strike Fighter) or a future bomber program ... the inclination from a business standpoint is to divest yourself of that expense,” Watts said.

58,RTN,"Pentagon No.2 bids farewell to most arms, not all"," * Deputy defense secretary urges spending on new bomber   * Says U.S. needs more robust cyber defenses   * Must trim other modernization due budget constraints   By Jim Wolf   WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The United States should boost spending on cyber security and advanced capabilities to hit distant enemy targets even as military spending shrinks with new budget constraints, the Pentagon’s No. 2 civilian said in a farewell speech.   “We should trim modernizations but preserve increases in key areas, such as cyber security and long-range strike,” Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn said Wednesday on his last day in office after a long Pentagon career.    Drawing conclusions from four previous post-World War Two defense cutbacks, Lynn said the nation must make hard decisions early on what to cut from the $530 billion-plus core defense budget.   Lower-priority programs that are eventually canceled, or curtailed, divert scarce resources, he told an audience at the Center for American Progress, a public policy group that bills itself as politically progressive.   “The net result is wasted spending and less capability.  It is better to have a smaller but ready force, and fewer but healthy programs,” he added.   Lynn said in reply to a question that increasingly sophisticated computer-launched attacks had the potential to threaten power grids, other networks and military capabilities.   As a result, there is “some urgency” for U.S. public-private partnerships to deploy more robust defenses, particularly around critical infrastructure, he said.   China is often singled out by U.S. officials as a match for suspected U.S. offensive capabilities in cyberspace.   Lynn did not mention China by name but said long-range strike — generally understood to mean a futuristic bomber capable of penetrating enemy air defenses — was an important way to deal with “anti-access” and “area denial” strategies.   Pentagon leaders frequently use such code words for China’s growing “no-go” ability to block the U.S. military from operating effectively in its backyard.   Lynn declined to specify which programs he favored cutting as part of what he termed a mandate to trim more than $450 billion in military-related spending over 10 years. President Barack Obama and Congress agreed in August to cut national security spending by $350 billion over 10 years, compared with a Congressional Budget Office baseline. Measured against Obama’s proposed budget for fiscal 2012, which began Oct. 1, the agreement translates into as much as $489 billion, including new White House guidance for additional cuts.   Lynn warned against further, across-the-board cuts of more than $500 billion designed to kick in if a congressional “super” committee fails to agree on at least $1.2 trillion more cuts over 10 years.   The impact on U.S. armed forces could be “catastrophic,” he said. The Pentagon accounts for about 20 percent of U.S. federal spending and roughly half of discretionary spending.   “We should bring troops levels down in an orderly manner that allows us to configure our forces to confront emerging threats,” Lynn said. “We should avoid across the board reductions that compel retrenchments in every theater.”   As the deputy secretary, Lynn has been in charge of day-to-day operations at the Pentagon since 2009. He was the Defense Department’s chief financial officer from 1997 until 2001. For four years prior, he was the director of program analysis and evaluation.   In between Pentagon stints, Lynn served as senior vice president of government operations and strategy at Raytheon Co  (RTN.N), the Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier of missiles.   He is being replaced by Ashton Carter, until now the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer.

59,RTN,"Lockheed:""Most challenging"" missile test a success"," * First “operational” test of THAAD system   * United Arab Emirates is to be first foreign buyer   * System now has nine hits in nine tries, U.S. says   By Jim Wolf   WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A multibillion-dollar missile defense system built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) successfully completed its most challenging test so far, downing two short-range targets in quick succession, the company said on Wednesday.   It was the first test of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, under what the Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency described as “operational” conditions.   Since advanced THAAD testing began in 2006, the system is a perfect nine for nine in intercepts attempted, said Richard Lehner, an agency spokesman.   The use of two interceptors was a first for the system, designed to protect against multiple ballistic missile salvos of the type that countries like Iran or North Korea could launch.   “It was, by far, THAAD’s most challenging flight test to date and demonstrates the system’s advanced capabilities,” Tom McGrath, Lockheed Martin’s THAAD program manager, said in a statement.   The test was carried out at the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Hawaii. THAAD is said by experts to be the only system capable of thwarting short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles both inside and outside Earth’s atmosphere. Raytheon Co (RTN.N) builds its radar.   THAAD is part of an emerging, layered U.S. shield against ballistic missiles that could be tipped with chemical, biological or nuclear warheads.   The troops who operated THAAD in the latest test did not know what day nor time the mission would occur, “to make this a realistic tactical environment,” the Lockheed statement said.   It said a THAAD missile intercepted an air-launched short-range missile and a second THAAD missile took out a sea-launched short-range missile “a short time later.”   The Missile Defense Agency said the target missiles were intercepted “simultaneously.” MDA and Lockheed did not immediately clarify the timing discrepancy.   THAAD is being developed for the U.S. Army. The Defense Department notified the U.S. Congress in September 2008 that the United Arab Emirates wanted to be the first foreign buyer. At the time, the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency put the potential value of the UAE deal at $7 billion.   Since then, UAE officials have identified some system elements “that they think they can do without right now,” Dennis Cavin, Lockheed’s lead executive on the deal, told Reuters in August.   The original notice to lawmakers said the UAE had requested three THAAD “fire units” with 147 THAAD missiles, four THAAD radar sets, six communications systems, nine launchers and related gear.

60,RTN,Pentagon review board cites flaw on Raytheon warhead,"* Deliveries of Raytheon’s warhead remain “on hold” * Raytheon declines to comment * Flaw could only be spotted in space: review board By Jim Wolf WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - An advanced guidance system on a Raytheon Co warhead failed during a December intercept test of the U.S. ground-based missile defense system because of a design flaw that could be detected only in outer space, the Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency said Monday. “The design issue could only reveal itself in the environment of outer space, not during ground testing,” Richard Lehner, an MDA spokesman, said in an email.  He said he could not be more specific. Integration of components and deliveries of the so-called Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle, or EKV, were suspended early this year. They are still on hold at least until a post-mission assessment of a non-intercept flight test planned for next spring, Lehner said. John Patterson, a spokesman for Raytheon’s missile systems business unit, referred a request for company comment back to MDA. The EKV’s guidance system had a fault related to “outer space-related dynamic environments” that caused the warhead to fail in the final seconds of the Dec. 15 test, an independent “failure review” board found, according to an MDA statement. “There is no indication of any quality control problem as the cause of the failure,” it said. The warhead used in the December test was an advanced version of the operational EKV now deployed on ground-based interceptors housed in silos at Fort Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Boeing Co , prime contractor for the ground-based midcourse system, worked closely with the failure review board and has “high confidence in the findings,” said Scott Day, a company spokesman. The MDA said deployed EKVs “do not have this design issue.” Asked which company supplies the guidance system that failed, Lehner wrote: “I cannot say, since the component is classified.” Corrective design steps are being pursued and tested on the ground and in a non-intercept test scheduled for late next spring, the MDA statement said. Assuming the non-intercept test succeeds, the previously failed intercept test will be repeated later next year, it added. The ground-based missile defense is the sole U.S. shield against long-range ballistic missiles that could be tipped with chemical, biological or nuclear warheads. The system is being shaped initially to thwart missiles that could be fired by Iran and North Korea. A new version of Raytheon’s Standard Missile-3 interceptor, known as Block 1B, used in the overarching shield’s sea-based layer failed in its first test on April 15. The current version of the SM-3 — the SM-3 Block 1A — has had 22 successful intercepts out of 27 at-sea  attempts since the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense flight testing began in 2002, MDA said at the time.

Boeing Co , prime contractor for the ground-based midcourse system, worked closely with the failure review board and has “high confidence in the findings,” said Scott Day, a company spokesman. The MDA said deployed EKVs “do not have this design issue.” Asked which company supplies the guidance system that failed, Lehner wrote: “I cannot say, since the component is classified.” Corrective design steps are being pursued and tested on the ground and in a non-intercept test scheduled for late next spring, the MDA statement said. Assuming the non-intercept test succeeds, the previously failed intercept test will be repeated later next year, it added. The ground-based missile defense is the sole U.S. shield against long-range ballistic missiles that could be tipped with chemical, biological or nuclear warheads. The system is being shaped initially to thwart missiles that could be fired by Iran and North Korea. A new version of Raytheon’s Standard Missile-3 interceptor, known as Block 1B, used in the overarching shield’s sea-based layer failed in its first test on Sept. 1. The current version of the SM-3 — the SM-3 Block 1A — has had 22 successful intercepts out of 27 at-sea  attempts since the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense flight testing began in 2002, MDA said at the time.",10192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/missile-raytheon-failure/corrected-pentagon-review-board-cites-flaw-on-raytheon-warhead-idUSN1E79I2AT20111019

63,RTN,CORRECTED - UPDATE 1-Raytheon sees growth despite budget woes,"* International sales strong * Opportunities in missile defense, intelligence, cyber * Little scope for top-tier defense consolidation NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Raytheon Co said it sees continued opportunities for growth in sales of certain weapons to the U.S. military — and to overseas customers — despite a downturn in defense spending. Chief Executive Bill Swanson said on Wednesday the company was well positioned, given its strength in missile defense, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, as well as the cyber security area. International sales are strong and should account for 30 percent of bookings this year, depending on developments in the next month, Swanson told an investor conference hosted by Credit Suisse and Aviation Week. He listed an array of arms sales already in the works or soon to be completed, with Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Kuwait, Turkey and Oman. “The system is moving. Things are getting approved,” Swanson said, adding that international sales would help Raytheon offset declines in U.S. defense spending. “We got a lot of activity in the pipeline,” he said, noting that in addition to solid demand from the Middle East and Asia, Raytheon was also eyeing new orders from India, Brazil and other countries in South America. He declined to give specific financial forecasts but said the company was “healthy.” Swanson welcomed Pentagon efforts to reform the way it buys weapons and said Raytheon was continually undertaking efforts to reduce its costs and safeguard its healthy profit margins. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras told the conference that he anticipated that Raytheon would continue to improve its return on investment over time. But the rate of improvement will probably slow, Swanson said, adding, “It gets harder.” He said Raytheon viewed navigating the current difficult environment as “a good challenge” and focused every day on becoming more efficient. Swanson said he saw little scope in the near term for consolidation in the top tier of the defense industry. But in the longer term, the Pentagon may be more open to such deals if they help drive down costs, he said. He said he was hopeful that Washington could avert the additional $600 billion in defense cuts required over the next 10 years after a congressional committee failed to strike a deficit-cutting deal. At the same time, he said Raytheon was running different models to think through the potential impact if the additional cuts took effect as scheduled from January 2013. “We’ve got to be smaller, we’ve got to be more efficient. We’ll get the job done,” he said.",11302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/raytheon/corrected-update-1-raytheon-sees-growth-despite-budget-woes-idUSN1E7AT1B420111130

For the full year, Raytheon’s adjusted earnings per share rose 7 percent to $5.90, a figure it expected to drop to around $5.45-$5.60 in 2012. Raytheon, which makes Patriot missiles and a vast array of other defence equipment, said net sales dropped 1 percent to $24.9 billion in 2011. It said sales would be around $24.5-$25.0 billion this year, as it and rivals cope with cuts in defence spending.

66,RTN,UPDATE 2-Ford won't bid to replace military Humvees,"WASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Monday it had decided not to participate in a new Pentagon competition to replace the U.S. military’s fleet of workhorse Humvee vehicles. Ford said it had examined a possible joint bid with defense contractor Raytheon Co and Future Force, a private maker of lightweight armor, but the three companies decided they could not meet the U.S. Army’s proposed schedule for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program. “Ford, Raytheon and Future Force ... have reviewed the request for Proposal for the JLTV program and decided to pass because we are unable to meet the program’s timing requirements,” said Ford spokesman Mike Levine. Levine declined comment on when Ford first became interested in the joint vehicle program, which is being led by the Army. The trucks will be used by both the Army and Marines. He said Ford had assembled the team that reviewed a possible bid. Raytheon declined comment, referring all questions to Ford. Industry sources said Ford’s decision to skip the competition was a setback for some Army officials who had hoped to drive down costs and move toward more commercial-type truck production by bringing in the No. 2 U.S. automaker. The Army had no immediate comment. The service issued a request for proposals on Jan. 26 for the multibillion-dollar program, one of few new development programs available to U.S. companies as the Pentagon begins to implement $487 billion in cuts to planned spending over the next decade. In the request, the Army said it planned to award up to three contracts this summer for work on 22 prototypes of the new truck to be used by the Army and Marine Corps. Two other truck makers, Navistar International Corp  and Oshkosh Corp, have expressed interest in the contest, as have several more traditional defense companies: Britain’s BAE Systems, General Dynamics Corp  teamed with privately held AM General, and Lockheed Martin Corp . Industry executives had expressed concerns last year about the terms of the competition, prompting some speculation that companies could skip the competition altogether unless the Army backed off plans that would shift more risk to industry. The Army is now looking for vehicles that cost around $250,000 each, below previous estimates that put the cost of each vehicle at well above $300,000.",2062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/ford-pentagon/update-2-ford-wont-bid-to-replace-military-humvees-idUSL2E8D6GZ720120206

73,RTN,Pentagon keeping eye on Raytheon program delay,"* Raytheon ground system needed to operate GPS satellites * Pentagon to review ground control program again this summer * Delay partly due to Air Force, general says By Andrea Shalal-Esa COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado, April 20 (Reuters) - The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer is keeping close tabs on the ground control system being developed by Raytheon Co to operate current and future Global Positioning System satellites. The company says the system may be up to six months behind schedule. Frank Kendall, defense undersecretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, and other top defense officials raised concerns about delays in the Raytheon program during an annual review of the entire GPS system on April 10. After that meeting, Kendall said he wanted to review progress on Raytheon’s Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) for the GPS satellites again this summer, said Major General John Hyten, the Air Force’s top space acquisition official. “Mr. Kendall wants to make sure he watches it closely enough so that ... if there are problems, he can weigh in at his level immediately,” Hyten told Reuters in an interview at a space conference here. Raytheon won a contract valued at $2.6 billion in February 2010 to develop the ground system that will operate the new GPS III satellites, being developed by Lockheed Martin Corp  for launch beginning in a few years, and the 30 satellites already in orbit. Current internal Raytheon plans project a six-month delay in delivery of the first version of the ground station software, which had initially been slated for August 2015, but company officials say they are trying to narrow that gap. The U.S. military is upgrading the capabilities of the GPS satellites a nd the ground system that operates them to improve their targeting and positioning capabilities, but also, importantly, to beef up their security against cyber attacks. Hyten said Raytheon faced a significant challenge but there was “absolutely no possibility” that the company would be removed from the program. He said Raytheon had replaced its management on the multibillion-dollar program and was working hard to accelerate it and develop the complex software needed for “information assurance” - protecting existing and future satellites against cyber attacks. Hyten said the Air Force was partly responsible for the delays since it had been late in signing a contract for the program with Raytheon. The Air Force also signed a contract with Raytheon in December for an initial version of the software that would allow launch and te sting of the first GPS III satellite, but would not allow use of the signals that the new satellites are being built to transmit, Hyten said. A congressional report last month said the interim launch control system would not enable the new capabilities offered by the satellites, including a jam-resistant military signal and three new civil signals. The current Raytheon plan calls for the company to deliver the launch and testing capability in February 2014, in time for a May 2014 launch of the first new GPS III satellite. The congressional Government Accountability Office said any Raytheon delay would delay the launch of the first GPS III satellite. Steve Moran, director of GPS mission solutions for Raytheon, said the company was working “hand in glove” with the government and Lockheed to accelerate work on the program. He said it was delayed by the government’s addition of new requirements. “We’ve had some problems, but we’re working to correct them,” Moran told Reuters at a space conference here. The GAO last month released a report that cited progress on U.S. military space programs after a decade of cost overruns and schedule delays, but said some spacecraft, including the GPS III satellites, still faced rising costs. The report cited 18 percent cost overrun on development and production of the first two GPS III satellites being built by Lockheed, driving their cost up to $1.6 billion. The Air Force this week said Lockheed had lost $70 million in incentive fees to help cover the cost increase. Additional fees are still available for Lockheed to earn. The GAO also raised concerns about a disconnect between development of new satellites and the ground systems that operate them. It said the Pentagon was unable to use data from one of two sensors on the first new missile warning satellites in real time because the ground segment software to process that data will not be ready until 2018.",4202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/raytheon-satellite/pentagon-keeping-eye-on-raytheon-program-delay-idUSL2E8FK8S620120420

79,RTN,UPDATE 1-U.S. seeks alternate satellite terminal bids,"* Pentagon approved conversion of Boeing contract to fixed-price terms * Bids from alternate providers due June 8 * Raytheon plans to bid By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force said on Friday it is still in talks with Boeing Co about revamping a multibillion-dollar program for next-generation satellite communications terminals, but has now formally invited other companies to submit alternate bids. The move is part of a drive by Air Force officials to crack down on cost increases that have plagued satellite programs for over a decade. It puts additional pressure on Boeing to finish development of the program or risk losing it to another bidder. The Pentagon’s acting chief weapons buyer, Frank Kendall, last month signed a memorandum that authorized the Air Force to convert its current contract with Boeing for the Family of Advanced Beyond-line-of-sight Terminal (FAB-T) program to fixed-price terms, and invite bids from other companies. “It is the Air Force’s intent to find the best possible cost solution in the FAB-T program, either through a new contract or by converting the current FAB-T contract from a cost-plus to a fixed price structure,” said Air Force spokeswoman Major Tracy Bunko. “Negotiations with Boeing on the current contract are ongoing while we continue to look at other provider options.” The Air Force on April 25 released a final request for proposals seeking an alternate source for development of the satellite terminals, which are needed to handle the most important and sensitive communications, including those transmitted by the new Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites built by Lockheed Martin Corp. Bids are due by June 8, with the Air Force expected to award a contract in September. Boeing said it was working with the Air Force to transition the FAB-T contract to a firm, fixed-price structure. “We are continuing to execute on the FAB-T program of record and look forward to completing the development of the FAB-T system,” said spokesman Matthew Billingsley. Boeing shares closed 0.3 percent lower at $73.56 on Friday. Raytheon Co, which unsuccessfully bid for the FAB-T contract won by Boeing, said it supported the Air Force’s decision to move forward with an alternate source for the satellite terminals and looking forward to submitting a bid. Raytheon has produced and tested other terminals that can operate with the AEHF satellites. “We are the only provider of AEHF terminals that are in production for the Army, Navy and Air Force, and look forward to the opportunity to bid on the FAB-T alternate program,” said to Scott Whatmough, Raytheon vice president. The Air Force nearly terminated Boeing’s FAB-T program in January, but decided to hold off after the company proposed  fixed-price terms with a “not-to-exceed” ceiling. Boeing won a $235 million deal to develop the new terminals in September 2002, but the program’s cost has ballooned to $1.6 billion, not including production, according to recent Air Force estimates. The Air Force’s fiscal 2013 budget proposal asked for $107.5 million to continue work on the FAB-T program, less than half the 2012 sum of $231.2 million. In February, Major General John Hyten told reporters that the Air Force would proceed with the alternate source program regardless of how the talks with Boeing turned out. A March report by the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, cited ongoing problems with the FAB-T program, noting that Pentagon officials now believed it would not be completed until 2017, three years after military plans to start using the AEHF satellites the new terminals are being developed for. The Air Force is examining overhead costs at its suppliers, and revamping acquisition plans for many of its major programs as the Pentagon begins implementing $487 billion in cuts to proposed defense spending over the next decade.",5122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-space/update-1-u-s-seeks-alternate-satellite-terminal-bids-idUSL1E8GC06C20120512

82,RTN,UPDATE 3-US zaps target in high-stakes missile shield test,"* Second straight success for new Raytheon interceptor * To be put in Romania in 2015 as part of Europe shield * U.S. calls test “critical accomplishment” By Jim Wolf WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. forces using a new Raytheon Co interceptor missile downed another missile in space in a high-stakes test of a shield built to thwart growing capabilities of countries like North Korea and Iran. The mission off Hawaii late Tuesday was against a medium-range, separating ballistic missile, the Pentagon agency responsible for it said. The mock warhead split from the target’s booster section, presenting what is supposed to be a more realistic attack scenario. “Initial indications are that all components performed as designed resulting in a very accurate intercept,” the Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, said in a statement Wednesday. Richard Lehner, an agency spokesman, declined to say whether the drill incorporated decoys or other so-called countermeasures of the type an enemy likely would use to confuse the defense. “We don’t divulge presence of countermeasures in any of our missile defense tests,” he said by email. The United States plans to deploy increasingly capable versions of Raytheon’s Standard Missile-3 through 2020 to help counter missiles that might some day be capable of delivering chemical, biological or nuclear warheads from Iran or North Korea. The new model, dubbed Block 1B, is to be put in land-based launchers in Romania in 2015 as well as on ships. It is a key part of President Barack Obama’s plan to guard NATO’s European territory from Iran, at odds with many countries over its nuclear program. The event was the second successful flight test of the new interceptor after it had failed to hit its target in September 2011, the first attempt. The previous successful test, on May 9, involved a less challenging, non-separating target missile. The latest test marked a “critical accomplishment” for the current phase of Obama’s so-called Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense in Europe, the MDA said. Production of the new model, delayed after the initial intercept failure, will start in the fall, Lehner told Reuters on Tuesday. Obama’s fiscal 2013 budget request calls for 29 of the new interceptors in the first production batch, down from 42 projected a year earlier, amid Pentagon budget scalebacks to meet deficit-reduction requirements. Japan also is expected to seek the Block 1B interceptor now that there have been two successful flight tests in a row,  Wes Kremer, Raytheon’s executive in charge of the program, said in a telephone interview. The test was the 23rd successful intercept in 28 flight test firings for the overall Lockheed Martin Corp’s  ship-based Aegis ballistic missile defense system. Aegis is the sea-based leg of a layered U.S. shield that also includes some 30 three-stage interceptors in silos in Alaska and California in a ground-based program managed by Boeing Co. The United States is spending about $10 billion a year to develop, test and deploy missile defenses. A total of 28 specially equipped Aegis warships - 24 in the U.S. Navy and four in the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force - now have the capability to engage ballistic missiles and perform long-range surveillance and tracking missions. The number of such ships is expected to rise to 36 by 2014. At 11:15 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time on Tuesday (0915 GMT Wednesday), the target missile was launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Hawaii, MDA said. The USS LAKE ERIE, positioned off the coast of Hawaii, tracked it with onboard radar and launched the interceptor in response. Using only the force of a direct impact, it collided with and destroyed the target in space in a so-called hit-to-kill intercept. The SM-3’s newest model incorporates an enhanced two-color infrared seeker and uses short bursts of precision propulsion to steer toward incoming targets. The target in the test, with a substantial range and the second, separating stage, reflects capabilities already in Iranian and North Korean arsenals, said Riki Ellison, a prominent U.S. missile-defense advocate who watched the test from Kauai. Taylor Lawrence, president of Raytheon’s Missile Systems unit, said test scenarios would become more complex “as we demonstrate the full capability of the SM-3 Block IB against more advanced threats.”",6272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/missile-usa-raytheon/update-3-us-zaps-target-in-high-stakes-missile-shield-test-idUSL2E8HR1TR20120627
83,RTN,Raytheon wins $636 million U.S. missile defense contract,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - U.S. arms maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) said on Monday it had won a $636 million contract to continue work on the key interceptor for the U.S. ground-based missile defense system, despite several intercept failures in recent years. The contract was awarded by Boeing Co (BA.N), the prime contractor on the missile-defense program, and runs through 2018. It covers development, fielding, testing, and operation of the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV), which is designed to engage high-speed ballistic missile warheads in space. Raytheon did not say how many of the warheads were included in the contract. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency last year halted deliveries of the advanced warhead after two failed missile defense tests in 2010. A subsequent investigation said the problem stemmed from a design flaw on the warhead’s advanced guidance system that could only be detected in outer space. Raytheon said it had demonstrated a remedy for the problem in ground testing and was now working to ensure the solution was “repeatable and producible.” There have been eight successful intercepts since the overall program began. Rick Lehner, spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency, said flight tests due to begin this fall and winter and continue into the spring would confirm the readiness to resume EKV production. Earlier versions of the warhead, without the design flaw, are deployed on ground-based interceptors housed in silos at Fort Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Raytheon Chief Executive William Swanson welcomed the contract award, which was announced at the Farnborough Airshow, saying it underscored the company’s leadership in developing cutting-edge technologies. “What I love about Raytheon is that we do things that are really hard,” Swanson told Reuters in an interview, describing the EKV as a system that “hits bullets with bullets.” The Raytheon warhead is designed to destroy incoming ballistic missile threats by colliding with them, a concept sometimes described as “hit to kill.” EKV has an advanced multi-color sensor that is used to detect and discriminate incoming warheads from other objects. It has its own propulsion, communications link, guidance and control system.

Judge Nancy Firestone of the U.S. Federal Court of Claims in Washington, D.C. awarded $10.1 million less than the amount Raytheon had sought, according to a 149-page decision made public on Monday. Raytheon had sued in 2005 after a federal contracting officer denied its claim, saying it had not paid pension deficits it had sought to recover for employees who remained within the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company’s pension plans. Firestone said the government and contractor should “pay their fair shares to ensure that the pension plans at issue are fully funded to meet the promises made to the employee-participants covered by the pension plans.” The judge had issued her decision under seal on June 27.

88,RTN,UPDATE 1-Raytheon wins $925 mln Pentagon contract for missile,"WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - Raytheon Co has won a sole-source contract worth $925 million for continued work on the advanced Standard Missile-3 Block IIA missile, a co-development effort between the United States and Japan, the Pentagon and the company announced on Wednesday. The Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency announced the contract, which is based on cost-plus-incentive-fee terms. The contract is to run through Feb. 28, 2017. The Pentagon said the new contract award increased the value of Raytheon’s existing contract for the missile to $1.51 billion. It covers development work through critical design review and flight test support. Raytheon welcomed the news, saying it was working with Japan to develop what it called a next-generation capability for the SM-3 missile, which is already used by the U.S. and Japanese navies to destroy short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles. It has been used for 21 successful intercepts. “As the threat continues to evolve, so does our ability to counter that threat,” said Taylor Lawrence, president of Raytheon Missile Systems. The new SM-3 Block IIA missile, the third evolution of the  SM-3 family of missiles, will have larger second- and third-stage rocket motors and a larger, more capable kinetic warhead, Raytheon said. It said the missile should be ready for use in 2018. ",7252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/raytheon-missile/update-1-raytheon-wins-925-mln-pentagon-contract-for-missile-idUSL4E8IP76N20120725
89,RTN,"Raytheon second-quarter profit beats view, raises forecast","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Weapons maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday and raised its forecast for full-year profit despite a drop in revenue, saying it is well-positioned to weather tough U.S. budget pressures. Raytheon, maker of Patriot missiles, radar and other military equipment, is one of the largest U.S. defense contractors, which are girding for the first downturn in defense spending in more than a decade. Raytheon was the last of the big U.S. arms makers to report earnings this week. Most beat expectations and boosted earnings per share due to share repurchases. But sales and net earnings were weaker nearly across the board amid mounting U.S. budget pressures. Raytheon, which just won a $925 million deal for a U.S.-Japanese missile program on Wednesday, said profit from continuing operations rose 10 percent to $472 million in the second quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $1.41 from $1.20 a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had estimated $1.22. “Raytheon generated a clean 22-cent operational beat, but we believe that the market will yawn given the lack of credit it has been giving to other companies generating margin-driven beats in recent quarters,” said JP Morgan analyst Joe Nadol. Raytheon shares traded slightly lower on Thursday afternoon, while other defense stocks edged slightly higher. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras said the company had booked nearly $1 billion in new classified U.S. government orders in the first half of the year and expected “significant” international bookings later this year. He said Raytheon remained concerned about $500 billion in further U.S. defense spending cuts due to take effect in January under a process known as “sequestration” — on top of $487 billion in cuts already slated for the next decade. But he said the company was well-prepared to weather the budget crisis, given strong and growing international demand, and its strong position in missile defense, cybersecurity and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems. “The strength of our overall portfolio suggests that we are well aligned with the priorities of the (Department of Defense), the classified community, and international customers,” he said. “We believe that positions us well for the future, irrespective of how things play out from a sequestration standpoint.” On Thursday, L-3 Communications Holdings Inc (LLL.N) posted a lower quarterly profit and revenue, mainly due to the U.S. drawdown in Iraq and Afghanistan. Raytheon Chief Executive William Swanson said his company’s results were driven by strong execution on programs and operational improvements, as well as share buybacks, and he was pressing for further improvements. Operating margin rose to 12.4 percent in the second quarter, up from 10.8 percent a year earlier, and the company repurchased 4 million shares at a cost of $200 million, bringing total buybacks for the year to $600 million. “Whether sequestration happens or not, it is ingrained here in our culture and you can see that reflected in our performance,” Swanson told analysts. He said he was encouraged by strong international demand, noting that Raytheon executives hosted 30 foreign delegations and held more than 600 meetings at the Farnborough International Airshow earlier this month. He said he expected a big order from Kuwait in August, followed by large orders from Oman and Turkey in the fourth quarter, or possibly early next year. He said many countries in the Middle East were re-examining their options given U.S. plans to pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan. Raytheon also saw promising opportunities in the Pacific region, he said. Raytheon, which celebrates its 90th anniversary this month, raised its forecast for earnings per share by 15 cents to $5.15-$5.30 from an earlier forecast of $5.00-$5.15. Sales dipped 3 percent to $5.99 billion in the second quarter, just missing analysts’ forecasts of $6.02 billion. Raytheon maintained its forecast that full-year sales would remain flat around $24.5 billion to $25 billion. Second-quarter sales rose at the company’s space and airborne systems division and were mostly flat elsewhere, except network centric systems (NCS) where revenue fell 15 percent and operating income dropped 28 percent. Wasjgras said the division’s performance should improve in the second half. Bookings fell 17 percent to $6.16 billion in the second quarter from $7.42 billion in the same quarter of 2011. Year to date, bookings totaled $11.32 billion, nearly 10 percent down from the same point last year. The company’s total backlog was also down, falling to $33.92 billion at the end of the second quarter, down from $34.48 billion at the same point in 2011. Wajsgras said bookings for the full 2012 year would likely exceed the company’s sales, with international orders accounting for 28 to 30 percent of that total. International orders are approaching about 40 percent of the company’s total backlog, Wajsgras told Reuters in a telephone interview after the company’s earnings release. In the longer term, he said strong bookings suggested the company would also continue to expand its top line. Raytheon shares were down 0.4 percent at $54.85 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

Sales dipped 3 percent to $5.99 billion in the second quarter, depressed by a 15 percent drop in revenue from its network centric systems division, as sales to the U.S. Army declined. That fell just short of the $6.02 billion expected by analysts. The division also posted a 28 percent drop in operating income, citing a change in contract mix and lower volume. Bookings fell 17 percent to $6.16 billion in the second quarter from $7.42 billion in the same quarter of 2011. Year to date, bookings totaled $11.32 billion, nearly 10 percent down from $12.52 billion at the same point last year.

International orders are approaching about 40 percent of the company’s total backlog. Wajsgras told Reuters in a telephone interview after the company’s earnings release. “We are ramping up in a very meaningful way in our international air defense program, and expect to have some significant new awards in the back half of the year,” he said. In the longer term, he said strong bookings suggested the company would also continue to expand its top line. Raytheon did not raise its forecast for full-year sales which are expected to reach $24.5 to $25 billion, after slipping 1.29 percent to $24.9 billion in 2011. Raytheon also raised its forecast for cash flow from operations by $100 million to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, despite a net outflow of $259 million in the second quarter attributed to the “timing of collections.” It reported a net outflow of cash of $89 million in the year-earlier period. Wajsgras said the second-quarter outflow did not reflect any new trend. Operating margins rose to 12.4 percent for the quarter, up from 10.8 percent a year earlier. Sales dipped 3 percent to $5.99 billion in the second quarter, depressed by a 15 percent drop in revenues from its network centric systems division, as sales to the U.S. Army declined.

95,RTN,"Raytheon earnings beat Street, raises 2012 forecast","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N), maker of Patriot missiles, radar and other military equipment, reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday despite a 1 percent drop in revenues, and it raised its forecast for 2012 earnings. Raytheon did not provide a detailed outlook for 2013, but said its high proportion of international sales and presence in priority military areas should help mitigate any impact if Congress fails to avert $500 billion in additional defense budget cuts due to start taking effect in January. “We believe and are confident that we have the appropriate plans in place to continue to drive the business forward under any conditions and in any environment,” Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras told Reuters, citing Raytheon’s broad portfolio and strong presence overseas. Analysts welcomed what they called a solid earnings report. Raytheon shares were trading 0.25 percent higher at $55.27 around midday on the New York Stock Exchange. Chief Executive William Swanson emphasized Raytheon’s strong backlog in a call with analysts and said he expected $6 billion to $7 billion in further orders in coming months. “Our bookings in the quarter were strong, and we have significant opportunities in both domestic and international markets,” Swanson said. He said Raytheon’s strategy of expanding its international business was paying off, although the timing of foreign orders was contingent on congressional approval, a process that sometimes took longer than he liked. Raytheon’s third-quarter results were largely in line with those of other weapons makers like Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N), which also beat expectations and boosted earnings per share on the strength of margins. Raytheon’s operating margin for the third quarter expanded to 13 percent from 11.8 percent a year earlier, and the company raised its operating margin forecast for the full year to between 11.8 percent to 12 percent, from an earlier range of 11.3 percent to 11.5 percent. It also raised its forecast for 2012 earnings per share to a range of $5.36 to $5.46, from a previous $5.15 to $5.30. Wajsgras said in the call with analysts that profit margins would remain in the same general range in coming years. Raytheon said earnings from continuing operations rose 6.3 percent to $1.51 per share, driven largely by operational improvements and the repurchase of 2.2 million shares. Revenue dropped nearly 1.2 percent to $6.045 billion, but bookings totaled $7.29 billion, up nearly 6 percent. Raytheon scaled back its forecast for full year revenues to a range of $24.3 billion to $24.7 billion, from an earlier forecast of $24.5 billion to $25 billion, mainly due to the timing of expected awards for its network systems business. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expected, on average, $1.27 per share on revenue of $6.16 billion. Bookings for the first nine months total led $18.61 billion, 4 percent below the year-earlier level, but Wajsgras said the company still expects to meet its target of $25 billion in bookings for the full year, plus or minus $500 million. He said the company expects to add several more large international orders in the fourth quarter, including a command, control and communications contract, several missile deals, and a follow-on order for Patriot missiles from Kuwait. Classified bookings rose 50 percent this year to date to around $1 billion, driven largely by orders for the company’s space and airborne systems and intelligence and information systems divisions, Wajsgras said. Raytheon increased its forecast for the full year for cash flow from continuing operations, and now expects $1.8 billion to $2 billion, up from the earlier range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Wajsgras told analysts he was comfortable with suggesting the higher end of the cash flow range for 2012 and said cash flow would be generally in the same range in 2013. He said the company still has authorization for just under $1.5 billion in share repurchases. Raytheon has repurchased 14.1 million shares for $725 million this year to date. Joe Nadol, analyst with JPMorgan, said the company’s third-quarter performance was solid, with operating margins exceeding his estimates in every segment except network centric systems. Wajsgras said the company might take a $30 million charge against earnings by the network centric systems business in the fourth quarter due to the possible termination of a supplier agreement, but declined to give more details. He told analysts the charge was a “worst-case scenario” and the company was in negotiations to avoid that outcome.

103,RTN,Air Force revamps Raytheon missile contract,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Air Force said on Thursday it has restructured a troubled air-to-air missile program run by Raytheon Co, freeing $104 million in immediate funding for the company and putting the program on track to return to its original schedule by mid-2014. Lieutenant General Charles Davis, the top Air Force official in charge of acquisition issues, said the two sides reached agreement last week on new contract terms that will pay Raytheon for delivery of actual missile rounds rather than the “performance-based” milestones used in the past. “That gets us back to where we would have been ... roughly in the middle of 2014,” Davis told Reuters in an interview at his Pentagon office. He said the Air Force would continue to keep close tabs on Raytheon’s AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), which is used by Air Force fighter jets and Navy planes that fly off carriers. “At this point right now the only thing that’s important ... is the delivery of the missiles,” Davis said, describing the Air Force’s decision to withhold funds from Raytheon “very prudent” after repeated failures of the missile’s rocket motors. After years of delays in missile deliveries to the United States and foreign militaries, the Air Force announced in March that it was withholding $621 million in payments from Raytheon until the company accelerated deliveries of the advanced missiles. On Thursday, the Air Force said it was resuming payments to Raytheon after a 10-month pause from February to December 2012. Spokesman Ed Gulick said no additional funding was being withheld from Raytheon at this point. The delays were caused by problems with solid rocket motors supplied by Alliant Techsystems Inc (ATK) that power the missiles, prompting Raytheon to switch to Norwegian ammunition supplier, Nammo. Raytheon welcomed the restructuring and said the program was “a top priority” for the company, noting that its investments in developing a second source of rocket motors were paying off. “This fall, Raytheon delivered more than 120 AMRAAM missiles, and this month we are delivering the first missiles with rocket motors produced by our second source along with rocket motor cases provided to them by our U.S. source,” said Raytheon spokesman Jonathan Kasle. Raytheon Chief Executive William Swanson told an investor conference at the end of November that the program should return to “business as usual” and recover its production schedule by mid-2013. He said the company had already received 125 rocket motors from Nammo and production was expected to reach 100 motors per month in the first quarter. Davis said Nammo’s rocket motors had performed well in tests, and the Norwegian company was now working to increase its production rate to the level needed for the program. He said ATK’s future role on the program was unclear, given that it could take the company around 18 months to reformulate its rocket fuel and get it certified. The issue had developed over time due to changes in the formulation of the fuel. He said the problems with the AMRAAM contract underscored the danger of relying on a sole producer of critical equipment, and the Air Force viewed it as important to maintain more than one supplier in the future. But he said the projected purchase rates could raise concerns in the future. “It’ll be something that we’ll have to pay attention to in the future,” Davis said. “It’s important that we try to keep more than one (supplier), but sometimes at the rate we’re buying or the rate we’re building it’s not viable for two companies to stay actively involved. It’ll be something that we’ll have to pay attention to in the future.” Gulick said the revamped contract also called for Raytheon to compensate the U.S. government and foreign militaries between $27 million to $33 million for late rocket motor deliveries. That compensation included no-cost labor to install a variety of software upgrades for foreign countries harmed by the late deliveries, warranty coverage and free repairs, Gulick said. He said the Air Force also got warranty coverage for 325 AIM-120D missiles, and 40 no-cost repairs.

106,RTN,"Defense cutbacks crimp Lockheed, Raytheon results","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Raytheon Co (RTN.N) warned on Thursday that U.S. defense budget cuts would eat into their sales this year, but they forecast very different effects on their bottom lines. Lockheed, the Pentagon’s biggest supplier, said it could cut enough costs that earnings would not only grow but also would exceed expectations. Raytheon, on the other hand, said its profit would shrink as the arms maker gets squeezed by the end of high-margin programs and the start of new, low-margin ones. Their divergent fortunes illustrate the tough year ahead for defense contractors, which are uncertain about just how deeply the U.S. government plans to cut military spending to help rein in the soaring deficit. Lockheed makes fighter jets, among other armaments, while Raytheon makes the Patriot missiles and other defense equipment. Lockheed’s forecast assumes Congress will avert $500 billion in additional Pentagon spending reductions known as “sequestration” that are due to take effect over the next decade, starting in March. But Lockheed still expects sales to contract as much as 6 percent this year, an even steeper slide than the decline of as much as 3 percent that Raytheon forecast. As spending challenges mount at home, Lockheed is pushing for growth in its international markets, and expects this to make up at least 20 percent of revenue in the “next few years.” “Certainly there’s continued strong demand for air and missile defense in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific...,” Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said on a conference call with analysts. Hewson said international orders and revenue in 2013 are expected to be in line with 2012 performance. “Maybe a little bit higher in orders.” The business contributed about 17 percent to both orders and revenue in 2012. Shares of Lockheed closed down 3 percent at $93.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. Raytheon shares also fell 3 percent to close at $56.54. Lockheed said earnings per share dropped 19 percent to $1.73 in the fourth quarter from $2.14 a year earlier, reflecting a large non-cash pension adjustment, higher income tax expenses and a charge for job cuts in its aeronautics division. Excluding those one-time items, the company earned $1.91 per share, beating the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S by 9 cents. The company said it expected earnings per share to rise to between $8.80 and $9.10 in 2013, well above even the highest of the 22 analysts’ estimates that make up this year’s forecast. Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson, who took over on January 1, told reporters that Lockheed remained focused on cutting costs and ensuring performance on key contracts. Barclays analyst Carter Copeland, in a note to clients, said the size of Lockheed’s backlog was “an encouraging sign given investor concerns around potential incremental cuts to the defense budget (including sequestration).” Excluding one-time items such as early debt retirement and accounting adjustments, Raytheon earned $1.47 per share, beating the analysts’ estimate of $1.31. For this year, Raytheon forecast earnings of $5.65 to $5.80 a share before special items, down as much as 9 percent from 2012. Analysts had been expecting earnings to fall a more modest 2 percent or so this year. “We see room for improvement over the course of the year (typical for (Raytheon)), but at first blush the guide is unimpressive,” Citi analyst Jason Gursky said in a client note. Raytheon Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras told Reuters the company was “very confident” about its ability to generate strong earnings and cash flow over the next three years, despite its forecast for a lower profit in 2013. Wajsgras said some new developmental programs in the classified arena were just kicking in, generating lower margins initially. At the same time, some higher-margin business, including a large international missile contract, will be ramping down this year.

108,RTN,Raytheon sees lower 2013 earnings after fourth-quarter fall,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Arms maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) on Thursday forecast a drop of up to 9 percent in adjusted earnings per share this year as it reported fourth-quarter earnings per share fell 7 percent on nearly unchanged sales. Additional U.S. budget cuts could have a big impact on the U.S. military and the defense industry next year, but Raytheon said its international sales and focus on high-priority areas should help mitigate the effect. Raytheon, which makes Patriot missiles and an array of other defense equipment, said adjusted earnings per share were $1.60 in the fourth quarter, down from $1.72 in the same quarter a year ago, but above the company’s guidance in October. It said operational improvements in 2011 were more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter, making it difficult to compare the 2012 quarter. Excluding one-time items such as early debt retirement and accounting adjustments, the company earned $1.47 per share, beating analysts, who had forecast EPS of $1.31, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Raytheon forecast adjusted EPS for this year of $5.65 to $5.80, which would be a decline of 6.6 percent to 9 percent from 2012, when EPS was raised by buybacks of 15.9 million shares for $825 million. Raytheon Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras told Reuters the company is “very confident” about its ability to generate strong earnings and cash flow over the next three years, despite its forecast for lower earnings in 2013. He cited the company’s recorded funded backlog at the end of 2012 and said international orders were approaching 40 percent of the overall total backlog, which was helping offset somewhat softer demand from the U.S. government. An additional big order from Kuwait, which had been expected at the end of 2012, is now likely to be signed in the first quarter, he said. Wajsgras said the company was forecasting lower earnings for 2013 because some new developmental programs in the classified arena were just kicking in, generating lower margins initially. At the same time, some higher-margin business, including a large international missile contract, will be ramping down this year. “If you stand back and look at the three-year outlook, we are very confident in our ability to post very strong earnings and cash flow over that time point,” he told Reuters. Raytheon’s revenue was nearly unchanged at $6.4 billion in the fourth quarter, but fell 1.5 percent to $24.4 billion in the full year. Sales were expected to range from $23.6 billion to $24.1 billion this year, Raytheon said. Chief Executive William Swanson said the company’s continued focus on productivity and program execution helped it achieve what he described as a solid operating performance in 2012. The company’s overall profit margin, adjusted to exclude pensions, dropped to 12.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 14.5 percent in the year-earlier period, but it edged slightly higher to 13.3 percent in the full year. Raytheon forecast an adjusted operating margin of 12.3 percent to 12.5 percent in 2013, down somewhat from 13.3 percent in 2012 but still among the highest margins in the industry, Wajsgras said. The company had new bookings of $7.9 billion in the fourth quarter and ended 2012 with a backlog of $36.1 billion, an increase of 2.5 percent, or $869 million, from the previous year. The funded backlog hit a record $24.1 billion, up from $22.46 billion at the end of 2011, Raytheon said.

Chief Executive William Swanson said the company’s continued focus on productivity and program execution helped it achieve what he described as a solid operating performance in 2012. The company’s overall profit margin, adjusted to exclude pensions, dropped to 12.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 14.5 percent in the year-earlier period, but it edged slightly higher to 13.3 percent in the full year. Raytheon forecast an adjusted operating margin of 12.3 percent to 12.5 percent in 2013, down somewhat from 13.3 percent in 2012 but still among the highest margins in the industry, Wajsgras said. The company had new bookings of $7.9 billion in the fourth quarter and ended 2012 with a backlog of $36.1 billion, an increase of 2.5 percent, or $869 million, from the previous year. The funded backlog hit a record $24.1 billion, up from $22.46 billion at the end of 2011, Raytheon said.

Wajsgras, speaking in a telephone interview with Reuters, cited the company’s recorded funded backlog at the end of 2012 and said international orders were approaching 40 percent of the overall total backlog. An additional big order from Kuwait, which had been expected at the end of 2012, is now likely to be signed in the first quarter, he said. Wajsgras said the company’s lower earnings forecast for 2013 is because some new developmental programs in the classified arena are just kicking in, generating lower margins initially. At the same time, some higher-margin business, including a large international missile contract, will be ramping down this year. “If you stand back and look at the three-year outlook, we are very confident in our ability to post very strong earnings and cash flow over that time point,” he told Reuters.",1242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/raytheon-outlook/raytheon-sees-strong-earnings-cash-flow-in-3-year-outlook-idUSL1N0AT3IM20130124

In the full year, adjusted EPS rose 6.2 percent to $6.21 from $5.85 in 2011, driven higher mainly by buybacks of 15.9 million shares for $825 million, the company said in its fourth-  quarter earnings release.

114,RTN,Raytheon says aces missile-detection tests in U.S,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Raytheon Co system built into big blimp-like balloons has demonstrated capabilities that could make it easier to detect and track certain enemy ballistic missiles, the company and the U.S. Army’s manager of the program said. System tests in December at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, successfully tracked four targets mimicking tactical ballistic missiles in “high-threat” regions, Raytheon is set to announce on Tuesday. The hardware is known as Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System, or JLENS. It includes a targeting radar and a wide-area surveillance radar with a 360-degree look-around capability that can reach out to 340 miles. Each radar system flies as high as 10,000 feet with a separate, 74-meter-long aerostat capable of operating aloft for up to 30 days while tethered to mobile moorings. The bulbous, blimp-like aerostats work in pairs officially estimated to cost about $450 million - though Raytheon has said it can lop a third off of that price. The December 6-7 tests met all primary and secondary goals, including “launch point estimation, ballistic tracking and discrimination performance,” Raytheon, the world’s biggest missile-maker, said in a draft press release. The missiles were tracked during their so-called boost phase, it said, including two that were “ripple-fired” one after the other. JLENS’ “proven capabilities” provide another tool that could help protect U.S. and partner forces from “the growing ballistic missile threat” and other threats, Dean Barten, who manages the program for the Army, said in the release. Barten’s statement was confirmed to Reuters by an Army spokesman. The army is preparing one of its two existing JLENS systems, formally known as an orbit, for a three-year exercise that will tie it into a high-tech shield designed to protect the Washington D.C. area from air attack. The second existing JLENS system could be sent overseas sooner. The system is designed to provide more time to detect and react to cruise missiles, manned and unmanned aircraft and other threats, compared with ground-based radar. It also has been demonstrated to be capable of picking out moving vehicles that could be used for attacks, including boats, cars and trucks, according to the Army and to Raytheon. “We think JLENS is ready for action wherever it may be needed,” Mark Rose, Raytheon’s JLENS program director, said in a telephone interview.

117,RTN,"Raytheon reorganizing, will save $85 million and cut 200 jobs","WASHINGTON, March 25 (Reuters) - Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon Co said on Monday it will pare its business units down to four starting on April 1 to boost productivity and lower costs, resulting in annual savings of about $85 million and the elimination of 200 jobs. Raytheon, maker of the Patriot missile defense system and other weapons, said the changes will not affect its financial outlook for 2013, which foresees a drop in earnings of up to 12 percent. The company has 68,000 employees worldwide. The company’s new structure will include four businesses focused on Intelligence, Information and Services, Integrated Defense Systems, Missile Systems, and Space and Airborne Systems. Parts of the former Network Centric Systems business will be added to each of the four units. Raytheon and other big weapons makers are girding for declining military spending after more than a decade of sharp growth. Eager to maintain profits, many companies have announced cost-cutting measures, layoffs and structural changes to cut overhead and drive down the cost of weapons programs. “Our new structure will help us enhance productivity, agility and affordability in a challenging defense and aerospace market environment,” said William Swanson, Raytheon’s chairman and chief executive. Top Pentagon officials are trying to rejig their budget plans for fiscal 2013 after Congress passed a stop-gap measure  averting a government shutdown this week that left intact over $40 billion in defense spending cuts on top of cuts already proposed by the Obama administration. Raytheon’s board also elected Thomas Kennedy, the former head of Integrated Defense Systems, to the new position of executive vice president and chief operating officer. He will lead the company’s consolidation efforts and manage day-to-day operations, while contributing to long-range strategic planning. Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to the industry, said the appointment of Kennedy as chief operating officer signaled the start of succession planning for the retirement of Swanson, who is 64. Raytheon does not have a mandatory retirement age and Swanson has not announced plans to retire anytime soon. The company said Daniel Crowley, who joined Raytheon from Lockheed Martin Corp in 2009, will succeed Kennedy as president of the integrated defense systems business, while Lynn Dugle will head the newly formed intelligence, information and services business. John Harris, who had headed the technical services business, will be vice president and general manager of the new business unit, reporting to Dugle. The missile systems business will be headed by Taylor Lawrence, who had been in charge of engineering, technology and mission assurance at Raytheon, while Richard Yuse will stay on as president of Raytheon’s space business, the company said.

118,RTN,Raytheon boosts earnings forecast after strong quarter,"(Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N) raised its profit forecast for 2013 on Thursday after a stronger-than-expected jump in first-quarter earnings, the only major arms company to do so despite fresh U.S. defense budget cuts. Raytheon, which makes the Patriot missile and a wide array of other military equipment, also raised its forecast for full-year cash flow, and its shares climbed 1 percent to $58.72 in morning trading. Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras said U.S. bookings will likely be trimmed by $400 million to $600 million this year due to mandatory U.S. budget cuts. He said that amount was in line with Raytheon’s expectations and recent talks with the Pentagon had not resulted in any surprises. “We have been talking about sequestration for well over a year. What we see today is not really different from what we had been expecting,” Wajsgras told Reuters in an interview. Chief Executive William Swanson told analysts that Raytheon was well prepared to deal with the budget cuts, describing them as “a speed bump .. that we think we forecasted correctly.” First-quarter earnings from continuing operations rose 8.9 percent to $490 million from $450 million a year earlier, and earnings per share increased to $1.49 from $1.33. Revenue slipped to $5.88 billion from $5.93 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected $1.28 per share on revenue of $5.69 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said it now expects full-year earnings of $5.26 to $5.41 per share from continuing operations, up from a previous forecast of $5.16 to $5.31. It raised its forecast for full-year cash flow to a range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, up from $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion. Raytheon revised its revenue target for the full year downward slightly, to a range of $23.2 billion to $23.7 billion from $23.6 billion to $24.1 billion. Swanson said he was confident the company would achieve its full-year revenue outlook despite U.S. budget cuts. “If the international comes in stronger, that’s even better,” he said, referring to the company’s current forecast for a book-to-bill ratio - orders received to orders shipped - of 1.0. Wajsgras said Raytheon’s first-quarter results exceeded its expectations, adding that its businesses remained well-aligned with the U.S. government’s priorities in missile defense, electronic warfare, cyber and intelligence-gathering operations. “We are confident in our ability to continue to perform well, even in a more difficult environment,” he said. Defense analyst Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets said the results were much better than expected. “The company continues to weather the storm in pretty good shape, helped in no small part by its significant exposure to defense exports,” he said. Bookings were sharply lower in the quarter, but Wajsgras said they would rise later in the year, when several large international orders come in. Raytheon’s results were in line with trends seen across the defense industry this week. The main impact of sequestration - mandatory across-the-board budget cuts - was expected to be felt later this year or early in 2014. Wajsgras said Raytheon, which generates more revenue overseas than its rivals, continued to see strong international demand, and foreign bookings were expected to rise 20 percent in 2013, accounting for 36 percent of the company’s backlog. As a result, international sales would rise to about 27 percent to 29 percent of the company’s total revenue in 2013. As seen across the sector, Raytheon’s adjusted operating margin rose 10 basis points to 13.2 percent in the first quarter. Swanson said he recently raised concerns with Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter that new program “starts” could suffer in the current budget climate, but said officials were “trying to protect those programs going forward, which I think bodes well for the kind of work we do.” Wajsgras told analysts he expected Raytheon to sustain high operating margins, noting that international orders often generate higher profit margins.

131,RTN,"Kerry visits Oman for arms deal, talks on Syria, Mideast","MUSCAT (Reuters) - Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Oman on Tuesday for Raytheon Co’s signing of an estimated $2.1 billion arms deal and to consult on Syria and Iran, U.S. officials said. Oman is expected to sign a letter of intent to purchase a ground-based air defence system that would help protect against cruise missile, drone or fighter aircraft attacks, a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters aboard Kerry’s plane. Part of the sale has been previously disclosed. In October 2011, the U.S. Defense Department notified Congress of a proposed $1.25 billion sale of Avenger fire units, Stinger missiles, and Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missiles to Oman. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the $2.1 billion deal included these elements - which are being funded with the help of U.S. government financing - as well as other items that Oman is buying directly from the arms maker. The official also said terms were still being negotiated and the value of the sale could change, adding it was unclear if Kerry would attend the signing expected on Tuesday or Wednesday. Raytheon spokesman Jonathan Kasle had no immediate comment. Raytheon Chief Executive Bill Swanson told an earnings call last month that the company was making “considerable progress” on a number of foreign arms sales, including a deal to sell a ground-based air defence system to Oman. Raytheon generates more of its revenues overseas than any other large U.S. weapons maker. It has forecast a 20-percent increase in foreign bookings in 2013. Oman sits opposite Iran on the Strait of Hormuz, through which some 40 percent of the world’s sea-borne oil passes, and is a U.S.-allied Gulf Arab State while also maintaining good relations with the Shi’ite-ruled Islamic Republic. Kerry’s visit is the first stop on a week-long trip that will take him to Amman for talks on bringing Syria’s warring parties to a peace conference and to Jerusalem and Ramallah to discuss reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. Both issues were expected to come up in Kerry’s talks with Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said, the Arab world’s longest-serving ruler, on Tuesday, said the officials, who spoke to reporters as Kerry flew to Oman. Kerry headed straight from the airport to meet the sultan at his main residence, the vast Bait Al Baraka palace. “It’s basically a chance to do a signals check with an important ally,” said a second senior State Department official. “Oman is not a key player on Syria but, as an important player in the Gulf, I think it will be good to hear the sultan’s views on the situation in the region writ large.” More than 80,000 people are believed to have died in Syria’s civil war, which began with peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad more than two years ago as popular uprisings swept long-time authoritarian rulers from power in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. It has since become a civil war fought largely along sectarian lines between mainly Sunni opposition fighters who have Gulf Arab and some Western backing and government forces supported by Shi’ite Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Assad also benefits from diplomatic support and arms sales from Russia. Kerry on Wednesday will meet in Jordan with senior officials from mostly Western and Arab states backing Syria’s opposition to discuss how to bring both sides to the negotiating table. The United States and Russia announced two weeks ago that they would try to bring the two sides together - possibly in Geneva in June - for a peace conference that would choose a transitional government. But there are a host of unanswered questions, including why Assad would send representatives to a conference which Western officials believe must eventually lead to his departure, and who will represent the opposition, which resists the idea of Assad having any role in governing Syria, even during a transition.

132,RTN,Raytheon wins deal to develop U.S. Navy's new electronic jammer,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N) on Monday beat out incumbent Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and others to win a $279 million deal to develop a new electronic jammer for the U.S. Navy, a deal analysts said could eventually be worth billions of dollars. The Pentagon announced late on Monday that Raytheon had won a contract for technology development of the Next Generation Jammer, which will replace the ALQ-99 tactical jamming system used on the EA-18G Growler aircraft built by Boeing Co (BA.N). The Navy said the new jammer would be critical for future combat missions and should be ready for use by fiscal 2020. The jamming pods will enable U.S. aircraft to render enemy radars useless. The 22-month contract, which runs through May 2015, marks a significant win for Raytheon, said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, noting that there were few if any other significant electronic warfare contracts expected in coming years. “This is a huge win for Raytheon and such a big blow to the losers that it may trigger consolidation in the defense electronics sector,” Thompson said. “This program is crucial to combating efforts by China and other countries to keep U.S. forces out of their region.” Thompson said he expected the losing bidders - Northrop, ITT Exelis XLS.N and BAE Systems (BAES.L) to lodge protests against the contract decision, given its importance, but said he did not expect the award to be ultimately overturned. Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said the company, which had teamed with Exelis on its bid, was disappointed by the decision and remained convinced that its solution was superior. “We look forward to the Navy’s debrief to understand why our offering was not selected,” he said in an emailed statement. Raytheon was one of four companies that worked on a 33-month technology contract that identified and matured critical technologies for the new jamming system. “We couldn’t be more pleased with the customer’s selection of our NGJ offering,” said Raytheon spokesman Jon Kasle. “We look forward to beginning work on this landmark program.” Naval Air Systems Command said the contract was the next step in transitioning mature components into testable systems, as well as developing a preliminary design for the new jamming pods that will be used on the EA-18G Growler by fiscal 2020. It said the technology development phase would be followed by a 4-1/2-year engineering and manufacturing phase, during which the pods developed by Raytheon would be testing and flown on the Boeing-built warplanes.

137,RTN,UPDATE 1-Raytheon CFO: Too soon to mull financial consequences for failed missile test,"WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - Raytheon Co’s chief financial officer said on Thursday that it was too soon to discuss whether the company would have to take any charges for a failed U.S. missile-defense test this month, when its interceptor failed to separate from the rest of the rocket. If government investigators determine the test, which cost $240 million, was caused by a quality control issue or manufacturing problem, that could result in financial consequences for the responsible manufacturer. “No one knows the facts, and we need to wait for the results of the failure review board,” Raytheon CFO David Wajsgras told Reuters amid growing signs that the test failure was linked to a faulty battery. Reuters, citing an industry source familiar with the probe, reported on July 12 that a faulty battery may have prevented the interceptor’s separation from the rocket. On Thursday, Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to industry, said the investigation was clearly focused on the battery, but it was unclear exactly what went wrong. “So far, the government seems to be signaling that the problem with the test was caused by a malfunctioning battery,” he told Reuters. Thompson said the issue of corporate responsibility would be determined once the investigation was completed. It was not immediately clear which company manufactured the battery involved, which was part of the interceptor made by Raytheon. Wajsgras said Raytheon was supporting the Missile Defense Agency in the analysis of the July 5 test failure, but could not comment further until the analysis was complete. Raytheon spokesman Jonathan Kasle said the company has not faced financial charges related to problems with previous missile defense tests. Despite the test failure, U.S. defense officials affirmed their commitment last week to the ground-based missile defense system, which is integrated by Boeing Co, but called for more regular testing to get a grip on quality control issues. James Miller, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, said the test failure, the third consecutive failure of the rocket to intercept a dummy rocket, was surprising and involved an “unusual anomaly.” He declined comment when asked about the faulty battery. He confirmed that the Raytheon interceptor, which is designed to hit and destroy the target warhead outside the Earth’s atmosphere, failed to separate from the third stage of the rocket, but gave no further details. Republican lawmakers have seized on the test failure to argue against reductions in spending on missile defense by the Obama administration, while the failure has sharpened concerns about the program voiced over the years by Democrats. The New York Times weighed in with an editorial on Thursday, saying “it doesn’t make sense to keep throwing money at a flawed system without correcting the problems first.” A spokesman for the Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency had no comment on any insights gleaned by the failure review board, saying only that such investigations often took months to complete.",7252013,http://www.reuters.com/article/raytheon-missile/update-1-raytheon-cfo-too-soon-to-mull-financial-consequences-for-failed-missile-test-idUSL1N0FV2LE20130725

Raytheon Chief Executive William Swanson, disclosing the stop-work order on Thursday, told analysts his company was “very comfortable” about its prospects for holding onto the contract. He said Navy acquisition officials were very thorough in deciding contract awards and generally prevailed in any protest actions. “And this is not a competition that happened overnight,” Swanson said. “We feel very comfortable in their selection. Of course, we’re biased, but we feel comfortable.” BAE last week filed a formal protest against the Navy’s decision to award Raytheon a $279 million contract for the next-generation electronic jamming system, a deal that analysts say could be worth billions of dollars in coming years.

Navy spokeswoman Captain Cate Mueller confirmed the Navy issued a stop-work order on the contract on July 18, as required when a protest has been filed, but declined comment on BAE’s claims. “Until the GAO determines the merits of the protest, which typically occurs within 100 days of a filing, we won’t have further comment regarding it,” Mueller said.

140,RTN,Raytheon raises forecast as profit exceeds estimates,"(Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) on Thursday reported higher-than-expected earnings and revenue for the second quarter and joined other major defense companies in raising its forecast for the full year despite Pentagon budget cuts. The company, which makes Patriot missiles and an array of other military equipment, experienced some delays in U.S. bookings as a result of Pentagon budget cuts imposed in March, but is “staying ahead of the curve” with continued cost-cutting and strong foreign sales, Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras said. Raytheon Chief Executive William Swanson told analysts that international sales rose 10 percent in the quarter, making them a key driver of the positive second-quarter results, and would fuel growth in coming years. He said Raytheon was nearing its goal of having foreign sales account for 30 percent of total revenue and could set even higher targets. “As we get to that milestone (of 30 percent) we’ll be thinking about 35, because you have to think in increments to go do it,” he said. Raytheon said it expected significant foreign business in the second half of the year, including Patriot missile orders from Kuwait and Turkey, and a deal with Qatar worth more than $1 billion. Several large U.S. deals were likely as well, the company said. The company this month beat out Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) to win a huge contract for a next-generation electronic jamming system for use on the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler aircraft, a deal worth billions of dollars in coming years. Swanson said the award solidified the company’s position as “a premier electronic warfare provider” and he was confident Raytheon would hold onto the deal despite a protest filed by competitor BAE Systems (BAES.L). The U.S. Navy has ordered Raytheon to stop work on the project. Swanson said uncertainties about future U.S. budgets persisted but that Raytheon would continue to cut costs and leverage its investments in technology to maintain growth. Wajsgras said strong international sales and continued cost-cutting should allow Raytheon to maintain its strong operating margin, now at 12.5 percent, into 2014. Wajsgras said Raytheon still expects the additional budget cuts in fiscal 2013 imposed under “sequestration” to trim $500 million from bookings for the full year and about $400 million from revenue in the second half. The company is pressing ahead to improve its operations and trim overhead by consolidating floor space, he said. A recent consolidation is ahead of schedule and will yield savings well in excess of the initial target of $85 million, he said. Defense analyst Byron Callan at Capital Alpha Securities said aggressive cost-cutting by Raytheon and other arms makers had kept them ahead of the wave of budget cuts for now but that 2014 and 2015 might be another story. “June quarter results are looking in the rear-view mirror. There are still an awful lot of unknowns beyond the control of contractors that will play out in the coming 12 to 24 months,” he said. Raytheon’s results were largely in line with those reported earlier this week by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), Northrop Grumman Corp and other big weapons makers. Investors drove defense shares up on the positive news this week, with Northrop and Lockheed hitting all-time highs. Raytheon shares reached a 52-week high of $70.70 on Thursday, but fell back to around $69.37, just below Wednesday’s close. Raytheon said it now expects earnings per share of $5.51 to $5.61 from continuing operations this year, up from an earlier forecast of $5.26 to $5.41. It raised its full-year revenue forecast to a range of $23.5 billion to $23.7 billion, lifting the lower end of its previous range from $23.2 billion. Second-quarter earnings rose to $1.50 per share from $1.41 a year earlier, while net income attributable to the company increased to $488 million from $471 million. Revenue, which fell in the first quarter, climbed 2.1 percent to $6.12 billion. The company’s backlog fell to $32.4 billion from $33.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.30 per share on revenue of $5.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Raytheon said the increase in earnings per share was mainly due to operational improvements and stock buybacks that reduced the number of its shares outstanding. The company’s integrated defense and missile systems businesses reported higher revenue and earnings in the latest quarter, but sales and profits fell at both the intelligence, information and services sector, and the space and airborne systems unit.

The company saw some delays in U.S. bookings as a result of new budget cuts imposed on the Pentagon in March, but it is “staying ahead of the curve” with continued cost-cutting and strong international sales, Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras told Reuters. “Looking ahead, the company will continue to stay in front of the environment and continue to be proactive in the way that we’re managing the company,” he said. “It’s a challenging environment, but I feel good about the position Raytheon has and how we’re going to operate going forward.” The company, which makes Patriot missiles and a wide array of other military equipment, said it now expects earnings per share of $5.51 to $5.61 from continuing operations this year, up from an earlier forecast of $5.26 to $5.41. It raised its full-year revenue forecast to a range of $23.5 billion to $23.7 billion, up from $23.2 billion to $23.7 billion. Second-quarter earnings per share rose to $1.50 from $1.41 a year earlier, while net income attributable to the company increased to $488 million from $471 million. Revenue, which fell in the first quarter, climbed 2.1 percent to $6.12 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected earnings per share of $1.30 on revenue of $5.8 billion. Raytheon said the increase in earnings per share was mainly due to operational improvements and capital deployment actions. The company bought back 3.4 million shares of its common stock for $225 million in the second quarter. It said it had repurchased 7.6 million shares for $450 so far this year. The company’s integrated defense and missile systems businesses reported higher revenue and earnings in the latest quarter, but sales and profits were lower in both the intelligence, information and services sector, and the space and airborne systems unit. Raytheon’s results were largely in line with those reported earlier this week by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and other big weapons makers. Also in line with its peers, Raytheon reported a drop in its backlog, to $32.4 billion from $33.9 billion a year earlier. Raytheon’s operating margin increased by 0.1 percentage point, to 12.5 percent, in the second quarter, and Wajsgras said it should remain strong going forward. Asked about the outlook for 2014, he said Raytheon should be able to maintain good profit margins, despite the challenging U.S. budget environment, through cost-cutting and international sales, which account for 30 percent of the company’s business. International sales rose 10 percent in the second quarter, and several large overseas orders are expected in the second half, he said. Raytheon also expects some sizeable U.S. orders, he said. Wajsgras said Raytheon still expects the additional budget cuts in fiscal 2013 imposed under “sequestration” to trim $500 million from bookings for the full year, and about $400 million from revenue in the second half. The company is pressing ahead to improve its operations and trim overhead, he said. A recent consolidation is ahead of schedule and is expected to yield savings well in excess of the initial target of $85 million, he said.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Oman in May for Raytheon’s signing of an arms deal to purchase a ground-based air defense system that would help protect against cruise missile, drone or fighter aircraft attacks. The Oman sale is valued at around $1.5 billion.

147,RTN,Northrop beats out Raytheon for F-16 radar upgrade deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) on Wednesday said it had been chosen by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) to upgrade the radar systems on F-16 fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force and Taiwan, a deal that could pave the way for more foreign orders in coming years. Northrop beat out Raytheon Co (RTN.N) to win the contract, which will add active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars to the F-16 fighters, giving them new advanced capabilities and improving their reliability. The company did not disclose the value of the contract, but hailed it as a major win. South Korea earlier this year chose Raytheon’s rival AESA radar for its own F-16 upgrades. “This next generation radar will deliver unprecedented capabilities to the most widely used 4th generation fighter ever flown,” Roderick McLean, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin’s F-16/F-22 Integrated Fight Group. Northrop said its newest airborne fire control radar, called the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), is designed for low risk retrofit in current F-16s but could be used in other aircraft as well. “SABR’s affordability, proven performance, and low risk make it the natural choice as the baseline AESA radar for new F-16 production aircraft and upgrades worldwide,” said Joseph Ensor, vice president and general manager of Northrop’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance division. Other AESA radars developed by Northrop are in use on newer F-16s, F-22 fighter jets, and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

148,RTN,UPDATE 1-U.S. Navy defends presidential copter bid format as firms bail out,"* Boeing, AgustaWestland pull out * Sikorsky sole company left bidding * Navy had planned contract award next year By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, July 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy on Wednesday defended the way it structured a competition for development of a new presidential helicopter, even as all but one of the companies interested in the multibillion-dollar program pulled out of the running. Officials at AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy’s Finmeccanica SpA, and Boeing Co, which had considered proposing its V-22 tiltrotor plane or H-47 Chinook helicopters, said Wednesday they do not plan to submit bids. AgustaWestland had teamed with Northrop Grumman Corp to pursue a possible bid. That leaves only Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, which is teamed with Lockheed Martin Corp, according to industry officials. Sikorsky spokesman Frans Jurgens said his company was confident that its S-92 helicopter - already in use by more than 10 heads of state - would provide additional capabilities for the presidential helicopter fleet, while reducing operating and maintenance costs. Bids in the new competition are due Thursday. The Navy had planned to award a contract in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Sikorsky built the current fleet of Marine One helicopters that whisk the president away from the White House. Lockheed was the prime contractor on the previous helicopter contract, which was scrapped in 2009 after requirements changes threatened to double the cost of the program to $13 billion. Defense officials said they did not expect the latest developments to alter their plans to proceed with the competition, and said there were procedures in place to ensure competitive pricing even in cases involving a single bidder. The no-bid decisions came weeks after the Navy’s handling of another large acquisition program, a multibillion-dollar contract for a new electronic jammer awarded to Raytheon Co , was challenged by Britain’s BAE Systems. Senator John McCain and congressional agencies have also criticized the Navy’s approach in a $34 billion program to buy 52 new coastal warships. Navy spokeswoman Captain Cate Mueller said the number of bidders was considered sensitive information while the acquisition process was underway, and declined comment on the consequences of the latest developments. But she underscored that the Navy’s request for proposals in the competition had been shaped by an extensive process that was focused on the military requirements for the new helicopter, not any specific aircraft offered by the companies. The Navy issued a draft request for proposals (RFP) in November and updated it several times. Navy officials also visited various industry sites and held several group and one-on-one forums to get feedback from potential bidders, she said. “Industry feedback was given serious consideration throughout the RFP refinement process with the goal of maximizing participation from interested bidders,” Mueller said. She said the Navy’s acquisition approach was looking to tamp down costs by integrating mature equipment into an aircraft that is currently in production, noting that one key lesson learned from the previous failed effort was the need to ensure that requirements could be met on time and within the budget. Lockheed was the prime contractor on the previous program, called VH-71, with the helicopters supplied by AgustaWestland. A similar situation developed last year on the Air Force’s new combat rescue helicopter after Boeing, the AgustaWestland-Northrop team, and Europe’s EADS dropped out, leaving only Sikorsky bidding for the work. In that case, Air Force officials said they would require Sikorsky to provide more detailed cost data to ensure that the resulting pricing was good as possible. AgustaWestland on Wednesday said it had decided to skip offering its AW101 helicopter for the competition because the requirements set for the deal favored a competitor. “There are fundamental proposal evaluation issues that we believe inhibit our ability to submit a competitive offering, and that provide a significant advantage to our likely competitor,” AgustaWestland said in a statement. Northtrop spokesman Randy Belote confirmed that the team had decided not to bid, but declined to elaborate. Boeing spokesman Damien Mills said his company opted out after concluding that neither the H-47 Chinook helicopter or V-22, which it builds with Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc, would be competitive for the program as currently structured. Industry officials said the Chinook was too big to land in the designated envelope at the White House, while the V-22 was too big to fit into the C-17 cargo plane for transport. The U.S. Navy’s posting in May called for construction of six developmental helicopters during the engineering design phase, followed by nine helicopters during a low-rate production phase and up to eight more in the following years. The current presidential helicopters are VH-60N “Night Hawks” and VH-3D “Sea Kings,” both built by Sikorsky.",7312013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-navy-helicopter/update-1-u-s-navy-defends-presidential-copter-bid-format-as-firms-bail-out-idUSL1N0G11WH20130731

151,RTN,"UPDATE 1-U.S. names possible East Coast missile defense sites, but far from decision","By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The Pentagon announced five possible missile defense sites in the eastern United States on Thursday, but said it was far from any decision to proceed with what would be an “extraordinarily expensive” program expansion in an era of budget cuts. The possible new sites are Fort Drum, New York; Camp Ethan Allen Training Site in Vermont; SERE Training Area at Naval Air Station Portsmouth, Maine; Camp Ravenna Joint Training Center in Ohio; and Fort Custer Training Center in Michigan. Madelyn Creedon, assistant secretary of defense for global strategic affairs, emphasized that no decision had been made to build an additional site for missile interceptors, and there was no money in the Pentagon’s future budget plans for such a site. In fact, she said, U.S. officials were concerned that across-the-board budget cuts would jeopardize the Pentagon’s plans to add interceptors to an existing Alaska site, a move announced by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel after North Korea threatened to launch a nuclear attack against the United States. “There’s no money in the (future) budget ... for an East Coast missile site. We have no money for this,” Creedon told Reuters in a telephone interview. “When you look at the future and sequestration, we get very worried about whether or not we’re even going to have enough money to do what we’ve decided to do,” she said. Current U.S. law calls for the Pentagon to cut its projected spending by $500 billion over the next decade, on top of $487 billion in cuts already planned for roughly the same period. Creedon said building an additional interceptor site would be “extraordinarily expensive,” but detailed estimates would not be known until a specific site was chosen. Missile defense experts say it would cost well over $1 billion, and as much as $5 billion, to build an additional site. Boeing Co manages the Pentagon’s existing program to deal with long-range missile threats, while Raytheon Co  and Orbital Sciences Corp build the interceptors and rockets. It is not yet known which contractors would be involved in construction of any new site. John Isaacs, who heads the nonprofit Council for a Livable World, said it was premature to talk about expanding a missile defense system that had failed to intercept enemy missiles in six of 10 tests conducted since 2002. “The United States should not rush to deploy a missile defense site on the East Coast until a need ... is identified and the interceptors to be deployed at the site prove effective and suitable in operationally realistic tests,” he said. Creedon did not comment directly when asked if sequestration budget cuts would force the Pentagon to scale back its plan to add 14 interceptors to the current site in Fort Greely, Alaska, by 2017, a project estimated to cost around $1 billion. She said only that sequestration was “a huge problem across the department.” Senior U.S. defense officials said they remained confident that the United States was already well protected against possible missile attacks from North Korea by the two existing missile interceptor sites, one in California and the one in Alaska. The naming of the possible new sites on the East Coast comes as a result of pressure from Congress, which has been concerned about the ability of the West Coast sites to protect against all possible missile threats, especially if Iran develops the capability to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles. Lawmakers added a measure to the 2013 defense authorization law requiring U.S. officials to identify three possible interceptor sites, including at least two on the East Coast. Pentagon officials say a further site is not needed, although Missile Defense Agency Director Vice Admiral James Syring told Reuters in an interview this week that a site in the eastern United States “would help with Iran.” Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also remained skeptical, even though one of the sites is in his home state of Michigan. “The military has told us that to this point, there is no military requirement for such an additional site. If such a requirement is shown in the future, the site should be located wherever it is most effective,” he said in a statement. Creedon said the Pentagon was complying with the law despite its reservations, and had spent the past months using publicly available data to whittle down a list of 450 federally owned sites, first to 10, and now to five. All of the sites are on federal land, operated by the Defense Department, the National Guard, or both, officials said. Creedon said the department hoped to meet the congressionally mandated deadline of Dec. 31 for deciding which of the five sites would be included in a more comprehensive environmental impact study expected to take 18-24 months. She said the discussion about whether to proceed with an additional missile defense site would not kick off in earnest for about two years - after the environmental study was done.",9122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-military-missile-sites/update-1-u-s-names-possible-east-coast-missile-defense-sites-but-far-from-decision-idUSL2N0H822420130912

154,RTN,Fitch Affirms Raytheon's Ratings at 'A-/F2'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Raytheon Company's  (RTN) ratings at 'A-' and 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. These ratings  cover approximately $4.7 billion of debt. A full ratings list appears at the end  of this release. Key Rating Drivers  RTN's ratings are supported by the company's competitive position in the defense  industry; good product diversification; a large portion of revenues derived from  international sales; strong liquidity; and large backlog. Healthy free cash flow  (FCF) generation and increasing international demand also support the ratings.  Fitch is concerned by RTN's exposure to declines in core U.S. defense spending,  and uncertainty surrounding the fiscal 2014 Department of Defense (DoD) budget.  A dramatic unexpected change in U.S. defense spending policies would be a key  driver of RTN's credit profile, although Fitch believes that modest defense  spending declines (which are incorporated into Fitch's projections) would not  necessarily lead to negative rating actions given RTN's current credit metrics,  liquidity position, and diversified product portfolio including international  sales.  Fitch's additional concerns include the large pension deficit and its impact on  cash flows; cash deployment strategies that include increasing dividends and  sizable share repurchases; and to a lesser extent, some pending legal issues,  including one with the U.K. Home Office for the termination of the e-Borders  program. RTN's credit metrics have stabilized over the past two years following  deterioration in both 2010 and 2011 due to bond issuances that doubled the  company's debt from $2.3 billion at Sept. 26, 2010 to approximately $4.7 billion  in principal at June 30, 2013. The debt proceeds were used to made discretionary  pension contributions of $750 million in both 2010 and 2011 and of $500 million  in 2012. Fitch views RTN's credit metrics as adequate even after the debt  issuances due to the high level of international sales, high product  diversification with low exposure to any given defense program, solid liquidity  and strong cash generation. Fitch notes that RTN's cushion to withstand negative  developments at the 'A-' level is reduced due to increased leverage over the  past few years.  For the last 12 months (LTM) ending June 30, 2013, the company had gross  leverage of approximately 1.3x, which was flat versus leverage in 2012. Leverage  was 1.2x and 0.7x at the end of 2010 and 2011, respectively. Fitch expects RTN's  leverage to increase slightly and to fluctuate within the 1.4x-1.5x range over  the next several years driven by expected pressures on the company's revenues  and EBITDA. RTN's liquidity position is one of the key supporting factors for the rating. As  of June 30, 2013, RTN had liquidity of $4.9 billion, including $2.5 billion of  cash, $1 billion in marketable securities and $1.4 billion of revolving credit  facility availability. In 2012, the company refinanced its debt maturating in  2014 and 2015. As a result, RTN does not have debt maturities until 2018, when  $251 million senior unsecured notes become due.  FCF (cash from operations less capital expenditures and dividends) for the LTM  period ended June 30, 2013, was approximately $1.4 billion. RTN's FCF remained  relatively flat over the past two years as the company generated $900 million,  $1.1 billion and $1 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Fitch  estimates that RTN will typically generate more than $1 billion of annual FCF. Dividends and share repurchases have been a significant use of cash in the past  several years. The company spent more than $1.2 billion on share repurchases  annually from 2007 to 2011. The share repurchases declined in 2012 as the  company repurchased approximately $825 million worth of stock. RTN has increased  its dividend payout by double digits annually over the past three years (16%,  15% and 21% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively). Fitch expects RTN to maintain  its shareholder friendly cash deployment strategies and continue dividend  increases, however Fitch expects share repurchases to moderate driven by the  decline in company's cash generation due to U.S. defense spending pressures.  RTN has a sizable pension plan deficit of $7.2 billion up from $6.5 at the end  of 2011. It was 71% funded at year-end 2012 on the basis of all plans and 72%  funded for U.S. plans. The domestic PBO was $23.8 billion at the end of 2012,  and the global PBO was $24.7 billion. The large pension deficit is mitigated by  the expected reimbursements from the U.S. government which treats a part of  pension costs as allowable and reimbursable costs under some government  contracts. Required cash funding is substantial, at slightly below $1 billion  for the next two years, however the reimbursements from the U.S. government are  expected to fully offset the funding requirements. RTN does not expect to make  discretionary contributions in 2013 and 2014. The pension plan deficit is  expected to decline in 2013 due to increasing interest rates and favorable  equity market performance in 2013. RTN generated approximately 73% of its 2012 revenues from the U.S. government,  primarily the DoD. As a result, defense spending is a key driver of RTN's  financial performance and credit quality. The DoD budget environment is highly  uncertain during fiscal 2014 because of the large, automatic spending cuts which  went into effect on March 1, 2013. The full implementation of sequestration  driven defense spending reductions beginning with fiscal 2014 will increase  pressure on revenues for most U.S. contractors. However Fitch believes it will  not necessarily have a significant effect on credit ratings in the U.S.  aerospace and defense sector if companies take actions to offset the impact of  the sequester.  The fiscal 2014 budget request submitted by President Obama in April 2013  attempted to avert sequestration cuts for the DoD and stabilize defense spending  at the fiscal 2013 budget request level. The fiscal 2014 DoD budget will be  significantly reduced from fiscal 2013 levels if the proposal does not pass or  if another compromise is not reached by October 2013. Fitch believes that there  is a high likelihood that the budget proposal will not be approved by the start  of FY2014, and Congress will either enact a continuing resolution at fiscal 2013  DoD spending levels or will let sequestration play out as the law is written  currently. Either scenario will result in lower military spending in fiscal  2014. Such uncertainty creates a significant challenge for defense contractors  because it impairs their ability to plan appropriate cost cutting measures to  counter the potential DoD spending cuts.  Most of the expected spending cuts are from projected budget growth and come off  the existing high spending levels. Fitch expects inflation adjusted spending  will likely decline, albeit modestly, over 10 years. As an example, Fitch  estimates the implemented budget cuts would only reduce base budgets back to the  levels seen in fiscal years 2007 or 2008.  Sequestration is incorporated into Fitch's ratings for RTN, and Fitch believes  that the implementation of sequestration cuts in fiscal 2014 would not lead to  negative rating actions given RTN's diversified portfolio, long lead times for  program execution and solid backlog. Sequestration is expected to impact new  awards and Fitch believes RTN will be able to adjust its cost structure to  maintain profitability. The exposure to DoD spending is mitigated by strong  margins, solid FCF, solid diversification within DoD's programs and strong  international sales at above 25% of total revenues, and RTN's good liquidity.  Rating Sensitivities: Fitch may consider a negative rating action should there be a dramatic change in  U.S. defense spending policies, poor execution on a number of key contracts,  and/or a major change in the company's financial strategy. RTN's liquidity  position and strong cash generation afford the company some cushion to withstand  negative developments at the current ratings. A positive rating action is  unlikely in the near term given RTN's leverage, the company's cash deployment  strategies, and the current uncertainty surrounding U.S. federal budgets. Fitch affirms RTN's ratings as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Bank facilities at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper programs at 'F2'.

155,RTN,U.S. eyes co-development of anti-tank missile with India,"WASHINGTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter this week proposed ways to deepen defense ties between the United States and India, including co-development of the next version of the Javelin anti-tank missile now built by Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Carter, speaking at a news conference in India, said the two countries were already expanding military relations through exercises and increased trade in weapons. But he said it was time to unleash what he called the “enormous untapped potential between our private sectors in the defense field.” The Pentagon’s No. 2 official said the United States was trying to remove bureaucratic hurdles impeding technology transfer between the two countries, and was giving priority funding to researchers working with Indian partners in key areas of science and technology. The Obama administration, mindful of declining U.S. defense spending levels, has tried to expand partnerships with many countries, including India, on military sales, and has dramatically stepped up its advocacy for U.S. arms sales abroad. India and the United States announced a Defense Trade and Technology Initiative, or DTI, one year ago during a visit to India by then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, a joint effort to streamline bureaucratic processes and expand defense trade. One new initiative, Carter said, involved seeking anticipatory approvals of some weapons projects even before India finalized its military requirements. A text of his remarks was released in Washington by the Pentagon. “We on our side have already reached out to U.S. industry to start identifying more transformative co-production and co-development projects that we can undertake together,” Carter said. “We’re going to keep reaching out and keep pushing.” He said he had proposed one specific project during his meetings in India this week - co-development of the next generation of the Javelin anti-tank missile. “Rather than simply buying this generation of Javelin, India would be able to ... also co-develop and co-produce the next generation of Javelin for international buyers,” Carter said. “That’s an entirely new proposal intended to reflect the DTI, and it’s being offered to no other country but India.” Asked about India’s response, Carter said Indian officials had said they needed time to consider the proposal. He said U.S. government and industry needed to overcome decades of segregation from their counterparts in India. “We don’t have the history that Russia does here, and we’re trying to replicate that,” he said. Washington was also offering a new electromagnetic technology for catapulting fighter jets off aircraft carriers called EMALS and built by privately held General Atomics to India, Carter said. Other possible areas of cooperation included counter-terrorism to maritime security. “There are no boundaries from the U.S. point of view, and as far as I know from the Indian point of view,” he said.",9202013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-india-military/u-s-eyes-co-development-of-anti-tank-missile-with-india-idUSL2N0HG00N20130920
156,RTN,Raytheon wins $243 million U.S. Navy order for SM-6 missiles,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N) has won a contract worth $243 million to build 89 new Standard Missile-6 interceptors for the U.S. Navy, the Pentagon said on Friday. The U.S. Defense Department said the contract would run through March 2016. Raytheon’s new SM-6 missile uses the airframe and propulsion of its legacy Standard Missiles, but adds the advanced signal processing and guidance control capabilities of its Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). When used on Navy cruisers and destroyers, the new missiles will give military commanders the ability for the first time to intercept targets that are beyond the line of sight, or beyond the horizon. The missiles will be part of the Navy’s sea-based missile defense, providing defensive capability against ballistic missiles in their terminal phase of flight. Raytheon has delivered more than 50 SM-6 interceptors to the Navy under low-rate production contracts. This marks the first full-rate production contract for the new weapon. Senior Pentagon officials approved full-rate production of SM-6 missiles at a high-level Defense Acquisition Board meeting in May. The missiles defend against fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, unmanned planes, and cruise missiles. Last month, the U.S. Navy fired two SM-6 interceptors from the USS Chancellorsville, a guided missile cruiser, successfully destroying two cruise missile targets in the missile’s first over-the-horizon test scenario at sea. The program is preparing for ship qualification trials on the USS Chancellorsville in November, and the weapons system is expected to be approved for initial operational use by the Navy later this year.

159,RTN,UPDATE 2-Turkey says Chinese missile deal not final,"* Turkey sees no need to consult allies on domestic defence * Initial selection based on price, ability to co-produce * Turkey could still back away from deal * U.S. says it expressed serious concerns to Turkey By Jonathon Burch ANKARA, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Monday it could still reconsider its decision to co-produce a long-range air and missile defence system with a Chinese firm currently under U.S. sanctions, but said it felt  no obligation to heed other countries’ blacklists. Turkey’s Defence Ministry announced last week it had chosen the FD-2000 missile defence system from China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp, or CPMIEC, over rival systems from Russian, U.S. and European firms. Turkey is a member of the NATO transatlantic military alliance. “We do not consider anything other than Turkey’s interests,” Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc told reporters. “It is not possible for another country to say, ‘I have a problem with them, I had put them on a black list, a red list, how could you give them a tender?’” said Arinc, who also serves as the government’s spokesman. CPMIEC is under U.S. sanctions for violations of the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act, and the United States has expressed “serious concerns” over Turkey’s decision. NATO sources said collaboration with China on the system could raise questions of compatibility of weaponry and of security. Arinc did not single out the United States in his criticism, saying comments from U.S. officials about the decision had been “respectful”, but reiterated that Turkey did not need to consult on matters of domestic defence. “We are a member of NATO and we have had good relations from the beginning with NATO countries, especially the United States. However, when it comes to the subject of defending Turkey ... we have the power to take a decision without looking to anyone else,” he said. Arinc said that while the deal had not yet been completed, the initial selection had been based on the Chinese offer being the most economical and because some of the production would be carried out in conjunction with Turkey. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States has made clear its concerns to Turkey at a high level. “We have conveyed our serious concerns about the Turkish government’s contract discussions with the U.S.-sanctioned company for a missile defence system that will not be inter-operable with NATO systems or collective defence capabilities,” Psaki told a daily briefing for reporters. “Our discussions will continue.” Psaki said the United States had taken note of comments by Turkey that the deal was not yet final. If a deal was finalised “then we will talk about that at that point,” Psaki added. President Abdullah Gul was quoted by the English-language Hurriyet Daily News as saying: “The purchase is not definite. ... There is a short list and China is at the top of it. We should look at the conditions, but there is no doubt that Turkey is primarily in NATO.” Some Western defence analysts have said they were surprised by Turkey’s decision, having expected the contract to go to Raytheon Co, a U.S. company that builds the Patriot missile, or the Franco/Italian Eurosam SAMP/T. The United States, Germany and the Netherlands each sent two Patriot batteries and up to 400 soldiers to operate them to southeastern Turkey early this year after Ankara asked NATO for help with air defences against possible missile attacks from Syria. Turkey has long been the closest U.S. ally in the Middle Eastern region, bordering during the Cold War on the Soviet Union. The U.S. military exercised great influence over a Turkish military that strongly influenced domestic politics. Under Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, elected in 2002, the role of the Turkish military in politics has been curbed. Political and military relations between Ankara and Washington, while still close, play a less central role, and this could be reflected in procurement policy. A source familiar with the competition said Turkey could still back away from its decision, describing Thursday’s announcement as a “selection”, not an actual contract award. The next step was for Turkey to actually negotiate the terms of the deal with the Chinese provider, which could present opportunities to back away from the deal, said the source, adding that U.S. government and industry officials had not received any advance notice about Turkey’s intentions. Raytheon and other losing bidders hope to receive a briefing on the decision, but those meetings have not yet been scheduled. Industry executives hope to schedule those meetings this week. Industry experts also said the decision appeared to have been based on cost, but they did not expect Raytheon to offer significant price concessions to secure the deal, given its big backlog of orders from other countries for the Patriot system and other missile defence equipment. Asked about Turkey’s decision, a NATO official said it was up to each nation to decide what military capabilities they acquire but that it was also the alliance’s understanding the Turkish decision was not final. “However, it is important for NATO that the capabilities allies acquire are able to operate together,” the official said.",9302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-china-defence/update-2-turkey-says-chinese-missile-deal-not-final-idUSL6N0HQ3D220130930

161,RTN,"UPDATE 3-Turkey ""highly likely"" to sign Chinese missile deal","* Official says deal could be signed within 6 months * Turkey sees urgent need to bolster air defences * Chinese firm chosen over U.S., European, Russian rivals * U.S., NATO officials raise concern By Tulay Karadeniz and Jonathon Burch ANKARA, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Turkey is likely to sign a $3.4 billion missile defence deal with a Chinese firm under U.S. sanctions, a senior official said on Thursday, a proposal that is already straining relations with Washington. Turkey sees a growing threat of spillover from the war in neighbouring Syria, as well as wider turbulence in the Middle East, and has been scrambling to bolster its air defences. Murad Bayar, Undersecretary of Defence Industries at the Defence Ministry, told reporters in Ankara that Turkey could finalise the deal with China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp (CPMIEC) within six months. Turkey’s Defence Ministry said last week it had chosen CPMIEC’s FD-2000 missile defence system over more expensive rival systems from Russian, U.S. and European firms. Despite Bayar’s comments, Turkish leaders have stressed the deal is not final. The United States has expressed “serious concerns” over North Atlantic Treaty Organisation member Turkey cooperating with CPMIEC, under sanctions for violations of the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act. But Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkey, which shares a 900-km (560-mile) border with Syria and has NATO’s second largest deployable military force, urgently needed to step up its air defences. “With the latest crisis in Syria and the crises in the Middle East, we have realised ... that however strong our armed forces are in terms of conventional weapons, they are not at the desired level to counter missile and related threats,” he said in an interview on local television on Wednesday. Turkey has seen Syria’s conflict frequently spill across its frontier and has responded in kind when mortars and shells fired from Syria have hit its soil. The government is also concerned about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons arsenal, particularly after a sarin nerve gas attack on a Damascus suburb in August, and parliament voted on Thursday to extend a mandate authorising sending troops into Syria if needed. NATO sources have said Turkish collaboration with China on the system could raise questions of compatibility of weaponry and of security. For China, it would be a breakthrough in its bid to become a supplier of advanced weapons. Bayar said Turkey was not sharing any information on NATO defence systems with China and Turkey was not bound to comply with sanctions placed on CPMIEC as they were not drawn up by the United Nations. “This is a short list and China is in first place. We are going to invite the Chinese, the offer is on the table and we are going to turn this offer into a contract,” Bayar said. “It is highly likely, a great probability, we will sign the contract with the firm we have chosen in first place.” He said if the deal went ahead most of the production would be carried out in Turkey. CPMIEC’s bid of $3.44 billion had come in significantly lower than rival systems from Russian, U.S. and European firms and below Turkey’s estimate of $4 billion, Bayar said. He said the Franco/Italian Eurosam SAMP/T system was second and Raytheon Co, a U.S. company that builds the Patriot missile, was third. A Russian bid had been eliminated. All losing bids had come in above $4 billion, Bayar said. Davutoglu said the selection was not politically motivated, and that the Chinese offer had met Turkey’s primary demands of price and the ability to place much of the production in Turkey, although he reiterated that the decision was not final. “It is as if people always think, ‘this government has an agenda and is making its choice based on this’. No, this was a professional choice. A choice determined by the criteria put forward. But this is not a final choice,” Davutoglu said. “If only Eurosam, or the American and European system makers offered better conditions and we could choose them,” he said. Some defence analysts said they were surprised by Turkey’s decision, having expected Raytheon or Eurosam to win the contract, and U.S. government and industry officials were reportedly not informed of the selection beforehand. “The deal with the Chinese may be designed to put pressure on Raytheon to negotiate a more favourable deal for Turkey, in particular a more liberal technology and know-how transfer and co-production and perhaps on price,” said Fadi Hakura, a Turkey expert at London’s Chatham House think tank. Industry experts have said they do not expect Raytheon to offer significant price concessions to secure the deal, given its big backlog of orders from other countries for the Patriot system and other missile defence equipment. “Turkey’s primary aim is to build a local defence manufacturing capacity,” Hakura said, noting Turkey had been trying to build a domestic defence industry since the 1980s. “Still, what the deal does is further poison the atmosphere of worsening relations between Washington and Ankara.” Turkey has long been one of the closest U.S. allies in the Middle Eastern region, bordering during the Cold War on the Soviet Union. The U.S. military exercised great influence over a Turkish military that strongly influenced domestic politics. Under Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, elected in 2002, the role of the Turkish military in politics has been curbed. Political and military relations between Ankara and Washington, while still close, play a less central role, and this could be reflected in procurement policy. NATO has said it is up to each country to decide what military capabilities they acquire but that compatibility with other members’ systems is important. Davutoglu said members did not need to consider NATO’s needs on everything as each country had its own national considerations. Bayar said a delegation of Turkish industry and air force officials had witnessed test launches from all the firms but that the Chinese had allowed Turkey to pick its own scenario and offered it a tailored demonstration. “We said we want this kind of a launch, and our delegation watched the launches as if they were the operators. These were real launches,” Bayar said.",10032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-china-defence/update-3-turkey-highly-likely-to-sign-chinese-missile-deal-idUSL6N0HT0LP20131003

168,RTN,Lockheed protests U.S. Navy's radar contract award to Raytheon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon’s top supplier and maker of the Aegis combat system, on Tuesday said it had filed a formal protest against the U.S. Navy’s decision to award a next-generation radar contract to Raytheon Co. Lockheed spokesman Keith Little said the company decided to file a protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) because it did not believe the merits of its bid were properly considered during the Navy’s evaluation process. “After careful consideration, Lockheed Martin has protested the Navy’s award of the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) contract,” Little said. “We submitted a technically compliant solution at a very affordable price.” Lockheed’s protest came as lawmakers from New Jersey, where Lockheed builds the Aegis system and related radars, raised concerns about the Raytheon contract award, arguing that it would be more expensive than the Lockheed proposal. Lockheed filed the protest late on Tuesday with the GAO, an arm of Congress that oversees disputes about federal contract awards, Little said. The agency now has 100 days to review the protest, with its ruling expected by January 30. Raytheon earlier this month beat out Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp to win the contract to design a next-generation air and missile defense radar for use on the Navy’s Aegis destroyers starting in 2016. Under the contract, Raytheon will build and test the new air and missile defense radar (AMDR) that will replace the existing SPY-1 radar built by Lockheed. A Northrop spokesman declined comment when asked whether the company had protested the contract award by Tuesday’s deadline. Officials at Raytheon and at the Navy could not be reached for immediate comment on Lockheed’s protest, which is expected to trigger a stop-work notice from the Navy. Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told analysts earlier on Tuesday, before the company filed its formal GAO protest, that the company was evaluating a briefing it received last week from the Navy about its decision. “We’ve been engaged on it, the Aegis system, for the past 42 years,” she said. “We had deep understanding of that program and of the mission, so we were certainly disappointed.” New Jersey lawmakers sent a letter to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus dated October 16 in which they expressed concern about the Navy’s decision to begin working with a new company given what they called the “unprecedented success” of the Aegis system. In the letter, the lawmakers said Lockheed offered “the lowest cost AMDR solution, which is low-risk and meets the key Department of the Navy leadership areas of affordability, ship fit, scalability and technological maturity.” A copy of the letter was obtained by Reuters. They said Lockheed offered the best value for the new radar given its past investment in the program, and had pledged to invest $135 million in the project as well as $70 million of capital improvements at the Morristown site. “We are most concerned that the Navy’s AMDR contract award decision, if implemented, would incur significant costs at this time of severe defense budget restrictions,” they wrote, saying the decision could result in $400 million of extra costs.

175,RTN,U.S.-Saudi diplomatic tension unlikely to fracture business ties,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s frustration with its main ally the United States over Middle East policy will not harm business relations or oil sales, despite a threat from its spy chief of a “major shift” in ties, businessmen and economists say. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the head of Saudi intelligence, warned European diplomats last week that energy and defense deals could suffer as a result of differences over the conflict in Syria and other issues, a Saudi source said. Although mega-contracts have occasionally been used to strengthen political relationships, particularly in defense, economists and businessmen said business ties between U.S. and Saudi firms were generally immune to dips in the relationship. “I don’t think there are direct links between trade and the political relationship. That’s not how the Saudis work. But it’s also true that when the bilateral relationship is good, it helps,” said a diplomatic source in the Gulf. The United States is the main supplier for most Saudi military needs, from F-15 fighters to control and command systems worth tens of billions of dollars in recent years, while American contractors win major energy deals. The world’s top oil exporter and its biggest consumer have enjoyed close economic ties for decades, with U.S. firms building much of the infrastructure of the modern Saudi state after its oil boom in the 1970s. Younger Saudi princes were mostly educated in the United States as were many of the kingdom’s business executives, senior officials and cabinet members, including the oil, finance, economy and education ministers, and the central bank governor. WAKE-UP CALL “When you hear Bandar threatening, it doesn’t mean we are going to sell our T-bills or stop the military contracts. That’s not going to happen. You are talking about a relationship and an alliance that goes back 60 years. But what they are doing is saying, ‘hey wake up, don’t take us for granted’,” said a Saudi businessman who declined to be identified. Over the decades, Riyadh has pumped its earnings from energy sales, often to the United States, back into the U.S. economy, buying its goods and services and investing in government debt. The Saudi riyal has been pegged to the dollar at the same rate of $1 = SR3.75 for many years, and the kingdom has put some of its $690 billion foreign holdings into U.S. treasuries. As a result, trade has boomed, with U.S. goods and services exports to Saudi Arabia hitting $17 billion in 2011, and U.S. direct investment there reaching $8 billion in 2010. “Commercial relationships on trade or oil won’t be affected at all. Saudi has had bad political relationships with many countries and still continued to deal with them commercially. This is just a political rift and doesn’t mean that it will affect the private or public businesses,” said a Saudi official. In 2012, 15 percent of Saudi oil exports went to the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Although Far East Asia received an estimated 54 percent of Saudi crude oil exports, the kingdom still ranked second after Canada as a petroleum exporter to the United States. The sectors that appear most vulnerable to official Saudi ire are big defense and infrastructure construction projects with government clients. However, the Saudis struck a $29.4 billion deal only in late 2011 to buy 84 new F-15s made by Boeing with Raytheon Co radar equipment. In November they also agreed to buy 25 C-130J transport and refueling planes built by Lockheed Martin Corp for $6.7 billion. Riyadh has turned to Europe for more recent defense deals, ordering Typhoon Eurofighters to be delivered by BAE Systems Plc. But existing U.S. contracts and Saudi military dependence on U.S. equipment, probably lock the kingdom into long-term relationships covering maintenance, spare parts and training. Only last week, the Pentagon asked for permission to sell Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates $10.8 billion in advanced weaponry, according to documents it put online. One business area where strong political relations are important, is nuclear energy. Saudi Arabia has plans to build several reactors that would likely interest Westinghouse. U.S. contractors have recently won major engineering design and project management contracts, including Hill International on the $5 billion Jabal Omar project in Mecca, Fluor Corp on a big railway and Foster Wheeler on gas and oil schemes. Saudi state entities and large companies prefer to deal with firms they know, said a Gulf economist who asked not to be named. “It’s not easy to suddenly change these things in response to short-term political considerations. They’re driven by reputation, reliability and quality,” he said. However, U.S. companies now have to face competitors from East Asia which vie for Saudi projects and implement them well. In recent months Chinese, French, German, Japanese, South Korean and Greek companies have won engineering and construction contracts in power, energy, petrochemicals and rail projects with a cumulative value of billions of dollars. The once-central oil element in the U.S.-Saudi relationship has eroded in recent years as U.S. domestic energy production surges and Saudi exports shift towards China. Chinese firms have snapped up Saudi contracts on everything from power stations to railways - even though China has vetoed Saudi-backed U.N. resolutions and has given political support to Iran, Saudi Arabia’s principal regional adversary. U.S.-Saudi ties plunged far lower after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, in which Saudi militants played a major role, said Bishr Bakheet, a prominent Saudi businessman. “Visas were targeted, there were class-action suits against our leadership. Our people were deported and arrested. It was a big mess, but we weathered it,” he said. Today, nearly half the 150,000 Saudi students on overseas scholarship programs are in American universities. “My generation, born in the 40s and 50s, were all U.S. graduates and the current generation are all U.S. graduates. It plays a role in strengthening the relationship,” Bakheet said.

178,RTN,"UPDATE 3-Raytheon posts higher-than-expected profit, boosts forecast","* Company eyes orders from Middle East * Earnings per share of $1.51 beat analysts’ forecast of $1.33 * Sees strong margins, weaker sales in 2014 By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Raytheon Co on Thursday joined other U.S. arms makers in reporting higher-than-expected quarterly earnings and raising full-year forecasts, saying it expected to maintain strong margins and cash flow in 2014 despite an expected drop in sales. Raytheon, maker of Patriot missile systems and a wide range of other military equipment, said it saw “tremendous opportunities” for landing several big orders later this year. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras told Reuters he was fairly confident about Raytheon’s overall business outlook and that mandatory U.S. military budget cuts required by sequestration were not hitting the defense industry as quickly as had been expected initially. He said Raytheon’s large international business, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the company’s backlog, was helping to offset the effects of the U.S. budget cuts, and he remained hopeful that U.S. lawmakers would resolve the ongoing fiscal crisis in coming months. “We exceeded our guidance on sales, earnings and cash flow, and we’ve taken the year up accordingly with respect to our overall financial guidance,” Wajsgras said in a telephone interview. “On a year-to-date basis, we’re seeing a lot of strength versus last year.” Chief Executive Officer William Swanson told analysts on a conference call that Raytheon was planning a continuation of mandatory, across-the-board budget cuts required under sequestration next year, but added the company still expected to generate strong profits and cash flow. “I would tell you that ‘14 feels a lot like ‘13,” Swanson said. “Revenue should be down just slightly, driven by domestic.

185,RTN,RPT-U.S.-Saudi diplomatic tension unlikely to fracture business ties,"* Good ties help business, but no direct link-envoy * Saudi won’t sell T-bills, halt military deals * U.S. firms face far more competition from Asia By Angus McDowall RIYADH, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s frustration with its main ally the United States over Middle East policy will not harm business relations or oil sales, despite a threat from its spy chief of a “major shift” in ties, businessmen and economists say. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the head of Saudi intelligence, warned European diplomats last week that energy and defence deals could suffer as a result of differences over the conflict in Syria and other issues, a Saudi source said. Although mega-contracts have occasionally been used to strengthen political relationships, particularly in defence, economists and businessmen said business ties between U.S. and Saudi firms were generally immune to dips in the relationship. “I don’t think there are direct links between trade and the political relationship. That’s not how the Saudis work. But it’s also true that when the bilateral relationship is good, it helps,” said a diplomatic source in the Gulf. The United States is the main supplier for most Saudi military needs, from F-15 fighters to control and command systems worth tens of billions of dollars in recent years, while American contractors win major energy deals. The world’s top oil exporter and its biggest consumer have enjoyed close economic ties for decades, with U.S. firms building much of the infrastructure of the modern Saudi state after its oil boom in the 1970s. Younger Saudi princes were mostly educated in the United States as were many of the kingdom’s business executives, senior officials and cabinet members, including the oil, finance, economy and education ministers, and the central bank governor. WAKE-UP CALL “When you hear Bandar threatening, it doesn’t mean we are going to sell our T-bills or stop the military contracts. That’s not going to happen. You are talking about a relationship and an alliance that goes back 60 years. But what they are doing is saying, ‘hey wake up, don’t take us for granted’,” said a Saudi businessman who declined to be identified. Over the decades, Riyadh has pumped its earnings from energy sales, often to the United States, back into the U.S. economy, buying its goods and services and investing in government debt. The Saudi riyal has been pegged to the dollar at the same rate of $1 = SR3.75 for many years, and the kingdom has put some of its $690 billion foreign holdings into U.S. treasuries. As a result, trade has boomed, with U.S. goods and services exports to Saudi Arabia hitting $17 billion in 2011, and U.S. direct investment there reaching $8 billion in 2010. “Commercial relationships on trade or oil won’t be affected at all. Saudi has had bad political relationships with many countries and still continued to deal with them commercially. This is just a political rift and doesn’t mean that it will affect the private or public businesses,” said a Saudi official. In 2012, 15 percent of Saudi oil exports went to the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Although Far East Asia received an estimated 54 percent of Saudi crude oil exports, the kingdom still ranked second after Canada as a petroleum exporter to the United States. The sectors that appear most vulnerable to official Saudi ire are big defence and infrastructure construction projects with government clients. However, the Saudis struck a $29.4 billion deal only in late 2011 to buy 84 new F-15s made by Boeing with Raytheon Co  radar equipment. In November they also agreed to buy 25 C-130J transport and refuelling planes built by Lockheed Martin Corp for $6.7 billion. Riyadh has turned to Europe for more recent defence deals, ordering Typhoon Eurofighters to be delivered by BAE Systems Plc . But existing U.S. contracts and Saudi military dependence on U.S. equipment, probably lock the kingdom into long-term relationships covering maintenance, spare parts and training. Only last week, the Pentagon asked for permission to sell Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates $10.8 billion in advanced weaponry, according to documents it put online. One business area where strong political relations are important, is nuclear energy. Saudi Arabia has plans to build several reactors that would likely interest Westinghouse. U.S. contractors have recently won major engineering design and project management contracts, including Hill International  on the $5 billion Jabal Omar project in Mecca, Fluor Corp on a big railway and Foster Wheeler on gas and oil schemes. Saudi state entities and large companies prefer to deal with firms they know, said a Gulf economist who asked not to be named. “It’s not easy to suddenly change these things in response to short-term political considerations. They’re driven by reputation, reliability and quality,” he said. However, U.S. companies now have to face competitors from East Asia which vie for Saudi projects and implement them well. In recent months Chinese, French, German, Japanese, South Korean and Greek companies have won engineering and construction contracts in power, energy, petrochemicals and rail projects with a cumulative value of billions of dollars. The once-central oil element in the U.S.-Saudi relationship has eroded in recent years as U.S. domestic energy production surges and Saudi exports shift towards China. Chinese firms have snapped up Saudi contracts on everything from power stations to railways - even though China has vetoed Saudi-backed U.N. resolutions and has given political support to Iran, Saudi Arabia’s principal regional adversary. U.S.-Saudi ties plunged far lower after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, in which Saudi militants played a major role, said Bishr Bakheet, a prominent Saudi businessman. “Visas were targeted, there were class-action suits against our leadership. Our people were deported and arrested. It was a big mess, but we weathered it,” he said. Today, nearly half the 150,000 Saudi students on overseas scholarship programmes are in American universities. “My generation, born in the 40s and 50s, were all U.S. graduates and the current generation are all U.S. graduates. It plays a role in strengthening the relationship,” Bakheet said.",10242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-usa-trade/rpt-u-s-saudi-diplomatic-tension-unlikely-to-fracture-business-ties-idUSL5N0ID42N20131024
186,RTN,Turkey asks U.S. to extend pricing on Raytheon missile bid: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Turkey has asked the United States to extend the pricing on Raytheon Co’s Patriot missile defense system proposal, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Monday, a sign that Ankara is keeping its options open in case its talks with the preferred Chinese supplier fall through. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan last week said Ankara would be open to new offers if its talks about co-producing a long-range air and missile defense system with China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp (CPMIEC) fail. Turkey’s decision to choose a $3.4 billion Chinese offer over rival bids from Russian, U.S. and European firms has raised concern among Turkey’s Western allies. The sources familiar with the U.S. proposal to supply a Raytheon-built Patriot missile defense system said Turkish officials had requested an extension of the pricing included in the bid while their talks continued with China. “It’s clear that they are trying to hedge their bets,” said one of the sources, who was not authorized to speak publicly. It was not immediately clear how long of an extension was requested. Turkey announced in September it had chosen China’s FD-2000 missile defense system over rival systems from Franco/Italian Eurosam SAMP/T and Raytheon. It said CPMIEC offered the most competitive terms and would allow co-production in Turkey. The U.S. ambassador to Turkey said on Thursday that Washington was concerned that the deal with the Chinese firm could undermine allied air defenses and had begun “expert” talks with Ankara to assess the potential impact. CPMIEC is under U.S. sanctions for violations of the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act. NATO is also worried about Turkey buying a system not compatible with those of other member states, potentially undermining a core principle of the 28-nation alliance. The sources said Turkey’s missile defense deal could also affect its plans to buy radar-evading F-35 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp, which also builds the PAC-3 missiles used by the Patriot missile defense system. “Do you really want a Chinese radar painting the F-35s every time they fly in or out of a Turkish base?” said one of the sources. Turkey’s Defense Industry Executive Committee had been expected to approve an initial order of two jets in December or January, the first of 100 F-35s it plans to buy in coming years to replace its aging fleet of F-4 Phantoms and early F-16s, according to a third source familiar with the F-35 program. But that order could now be delayed until concerns about the missile defense system procurement had been addressed, said one of the sources familiar with the U.S.-Turkish discussions. Officials at Raytheon and Lockheed declined comment. No comment was immediately available from the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees major foreign arms sales. Turkish officials said only that discussions with the Chinese firm were continuing. “As the final decision has not been taken, the other firms on the list always have the possibility to improve their bids,” a senior Turkish official told Reuters. “But rather than pricing, joint production in Turkey is more important,” the source said, adding it would depend on the outcome of negotiations with the Chinese before Turkey decided whether or not to go back to other bidders.

In Wednesday’s test at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, MEADS destroyed two targets launched from opposite directions at the same time: a QF-4 air-breathing drone coming from the south, and a Lance missile that was flying a ballistic missile trajectory from the north. “No fielded ground-mobile air and missile defense can intercept targets from two directions at the same time, as MEADS did today,” said Gregory Kee, who manages the program for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). He said the system can intercept “multiple targets,” more than the two it destroyed on Wednesday. He could not give the exact number since it was classified. “MEADS has eight times the capability of some of the existing systems today,” he added. The United States, Italy and Germany spent about $3.4 billion to develop MEADS over the past decade as a successor to the Patriot missile defense system. Washington decided last year to withdraw after the development program, citing budget cuts. Poland is considering joining the program, and sent officials to observe the test conducted jointly by the United States, Germany and Italy, the company said. Raytheon Co is the prime contractor for the Patriot system, which uses PAC-3 missiles made by Lockheed, and has continued to generate large international orders. Lockheed says MEADS offers broader protection against missile attacks than the older Patriot system, and is cheaper and easier to transport. Officials also say MEADS is the only system that offers 360-degree coverage. Raytheon officials say the Patriot system, which first entered the U.S. Army’s inventory in 1982, has been heavily modernized, with large foreign orders helping fund new digital processors, touch panel screens and portable trainers. Critics of MEADS say it has not been tested in combat, while the Patriot system has demonstrated it can fire the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles developed for MEADS. The Pentagon put a final $310 million in funding into the MEADS program in fiscal 2013 to pay for the last test and bring the developmental program to a close. Kee said Wednesday’s test had proven the maturity of the technologies in the MEADS progam and would allow all three countries to use it. He said the program had already demonstrated its ability to integrate with NATO weapons systems, and further demonstrations were planned over the coming year before the development program ends next autumn. The Pentagon has said it plans to “harvest” technologies from the MEADS system for other missile defense efforts, but details have not been released. Kee said the U.S. Army concluded in an interim report that the MEADS program had “very mature hardware and software.” MEADS said Polish officials also observed Wednesday’s test as they move to launch a competition valued at $3 billion to $5 billion in January for a new air and missile defense system. Marty Coyne, business development director for Lockheed’s air and missile defense business, said MEADS would be a “perfect fit” for Poland since it was looking for significant participation by its own companies, and it wanted 360-degree coverage, which is not offered by any other company. He said Poland expected to start a formal acquisition process in January, with a contract award likely by the end of 2014. The timing would work well for MEADS, since the development program will just be ending at that point, he said.",11062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-defense-meads/update-1-meads-missile-defense-destroyed-2-targets-at-once-lockheed-idUSL2N0IR23G20131106

191,RTN,UPDATE 1-U.S. GAO rules for BAE Systems in Navy contract protest,"By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) on Wednesday ruled in favor of BAE Systems PLC in the British company’s protest of a U.S. Navy decision to award to Raytheon Co a contract for a next-generation electronic jammer, BAE and the Navy said. The ruling reopens the procurement process for the jammer, but it was not immediately clear when the contract bidding would resume. BAE protested to the GAO in July, saying it had concerns over how the Navy had evaluated its offering to win a deal worth about $279 billion. “We are pleased that the GAO has sustained our protest. We look forward to working with the Navy to ensure a fair and open evaluation of our proposal for this important program,” a BAE spokeswoman said. In a report, the GAO, the audit and investigative arm of Congress, criticized the Navy’s handling of the procurement process involved in awarding the contract. The GAO said the Navy failed to reasonably evaluate the risk of the proposals, did not adequately document its decisions, and improperly credited Raytheon with outdated performance data. It did not address the merits of the competing offers, which came from Northrup Grumman Corp as well as BAE Systems. “This is a very positive development for BAE, because they get another crack at winning this crucial contract,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute. “However, there is no guarantee that Raytheon won’t win this again. The decision is about the process rather than the substance of the proposal.” The new jammer will replace the ALQ-99 tactical jamming system used on the EA-18G Growler aircraft build by Boeing Co. . The Navy has said the jammer will be critical for future combat missions. The jamming pods will enable U.S. aircraft to render enemy radars useless.",11132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/baesystems-usnavy-protest/update-1-u-s-gao-rules-for-bae-systems-in-navy-contract-protest-idUSL2N0IY2D720131113

The Netherlands, Germany and the United States, which deployed the missiles to Turkey, must now take national decisions on keeping them there, the official said. In Germany and the Netherlands that requires parliamentary approval. All three nations said they were in favor of keeping the missiles in Turkey provided they gained the necessary approvals at home, a NATO source said. The three countries each sent two Patriot missile batteries and soldiers to operate them at the start of this year after Turkey asked for NATO help in increasing border security. They were initially expected to remain for up to a year but no time limit was set. NATO ambassadors discussed the situation on Wednesday and “agreed that the overall risks and threats to Turkey remain serious,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They did not specify how much longer the missiles should remain. “Ambassadors noted that the instability along NATO’s southeastern border requires ... the extension of the deployment of the Patriot missiles,” he said. “The nature of the mission will remain defensive only.” Turkey has been one of President Bashar al-Assad’s fiercest critics, leading calls for international intervention in the conflict, supporting the Syrian rebels and providing shelter for nearly 700,000 Syrian refugees. The frontier has become a flashpoint in the civil war, now in its third year, with shells fired from Syrian territory frequently landing inside Turkey, drawing a response in kind from the Turkish military. Several top NATO leaders have voiced concern over Turkey’s provisional decision in September to buy a Chinese missile defense system in a $3.4 billion deal in preference to rivals, including Raytheon Co’s Patriot system. Raytheon and fellow U.S. arms maker Lockheed Martin Corp, which builds PAC-3 missiles for the Patriot system, are considering ways to sweeten their offer to build a Patriot system for Turkey after Ankara said it could still back away from the deal with China, sources familiar with the issue said on Tuesday.

194,RTN,"Raytheon, Lockheed consider fresh bid for Turkey missile defense","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. arms makers Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp are considering ways to sweeten their offer to build a Patriot missile defense system for Turkey after Ankara said it could still back away from a provisional $3.4 billion deal with China, sources familiar with the issue said on Tuesday. “There are internal discussions going on about improving the Patriot offer,” said one source, who is familiar with the talks but not authorized to speak publicly. A second source confirmed that preliminary discussions were under way within industry and the U.S. government about how the offer could be adjusted to be more competitive with bids submitted by the Chinese firm, and a European group. Both sources said no decisions had been made and it was important to allow Turkey - a member of NATO - time to make up its mind. Turkey announced in September it had chosen China’s FD-2000 long-range air and missile defense system against rival offers from Franco/Italian Eurosam SAMP/T and Raytheon. It said China offered the most competitive terms and would allow co-production in Turkey, but the decision caused alarm in NATO countries worried about China’s growing clout. Secretary of State John Kerry and other U.S. government officials raised concerns after Ankara’s choice of the missile defense system built by China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp, a firm that is under U.S. sanctions for violating the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act. “We continue to convey our serious concerns about the Turkish government’s contract discussions with a Chinese company - which is currently sanctioned by the United States - for an air and missile defense system that will not be inter-operable with NATO systems or collective defense capabilities,” said one State Department official. State Department officials said Kerry had expressed his concerns to Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in New York, and Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, who oversees European and Eurasian affairs, has discussed the issue with senior Turkish officials. Washington sees Turkey as a key partner in the Middle East, with common interests from energy security to counter-terrorism, but Ankara is not the deferential ally it once was as it seeks an increasingly independent role on the world stage. One of the sources said the U.S. companies were examining whether they could scale back their bid to bring it more in line with what was offered by the Chinese firm, which did not include the capability to target medium-range missiles. That may involve changes in the missiles that would be provided with the Patriot system. The companies are also reviewing the offset agreements and co-production deals involved in the U.S. bid, the sources said. Turkey was seeking some space launch capabilities, but it was unclear if U.S. officials would approve the export of such sensitive technologies as part of an offset package accompanying the missile defense deal, said one of the sources. The sources said the U.S. proposal was more comprehensive and offered Turkey greater capabilities than the Chinese system, as well as ongoing maintenance and technical support for the Patriot missile defense system. They said the offer also included substantial co-production arrangements. “It’s really not certain how it will work out,” said one of the sources. “But there is a lot of interest in at least examining what could possibly be done.” F-35 FIGHTER Sources familiar with the discussions have said the deal could affect Turkey’s plans to buy radar-evading F-35 fighter jets built by Lockheed. Turkey helped fund development of the F-35 and hopes its participation results in component orders for Turkish firms. Pentagon officials have confirmed that the Defense Department’s policy chief, James Miller, visited Turkey this month, but declined to give any details about his discussions with Turkish officials about the missile defense deal. Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz last week said Turkey has asked bidders for the missile defense system to extend the their bids and offer improved terms - in case talks with the Chinese firm failed.

196,RTN,Raytheon says in final talks on Qatar Patriot deal,"DUBAI (Reuters) - U.S. arms maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) said on Tuesday it hoped to finalize the sale of its Patriot air and missile defense system to Qatar “fairly quickly,” and wrap up the sale of additional Patriot fire units to Kuwait before the end of the year. Tim Glaeser, vice president of Raytheon’s Integrated Defense Systems business, told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow that demand for the company’s Patriot and other missile defense equipment remained strong in the Gulf region. Glaeser cited growing interest among members of the Gulf Cooperation Council in developing a regional missile defense system similar to that operated by NATO, and said Raytheon was ready to help if asked. U.S. industry executives participating in the air show say Gulf nations have not signaled any declining interest in beefing up their missile defense capabilities despite recent U.S. talks with Iran about dismantling its nuclear program. Glaeser said Qatar was poised to become the fourth Gulf country to operate the Patriot system, joining the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Raytheon builds Patriot - a long-range, high-altitude, all-weather system - and acts as the systems integrator for the PAC-3 missile, which is built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras told Reuters last month he saw “tremendous opportunities” for international bookings in the fourth quarter, including large missile defense orders from Qatar, Kuwait and Oman. Raytheon officials have said in the past that the Qatar deal involves 11 fire units and is valued at around $2 billion. Glaeser said officials from Qatar, the U.S. government and Raytheon were working to finish an agreement “as soon as all the Is are dotted and the Ts are crossed.” “There is a threat in the region and there is clearly a desire to move forward with an integrated air and missile defense. I think you’ll see that happen fairly quickly,” he said, although he declined to predict if the deal would close before year-end. Raytheon has seen a resurgence in its Patriot program after the United Arab Emirates helped fund a major redesign to make the system faster, smarter and tougher as part of a $3.3 billion order in 2008. The Patriot system is already used by 12 countries - United States, Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea and UAE. Glaeser said Raytheon hoped to wrap up a deal with Kuwait for additional fire units before the end of the year, with more orders possible later. He said the company was also working to finalize a significant sale of its medium-range National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System to Oman in the near future.

Swanson said he just returned from a visit to the region, including stops in Qatar, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, where he met with senior leaders about an array of missile defense deals and other orders. “We used to talk about months and now they are weeks (away) that we can touch them and see them,” Swanson told a conference hosted by Credit Suisse. “There is probably $4 billion or $5 billion worth of business out there that I was able to touch real quick.” Raytheon and other big weapons makers are looking to foreign orders to help offset a reduction in projected U.S. military spending over the next decade. Raytheon’s chief financial officer, Dave Wajsgras, told the conference that more than 30 percent of Raytheon’s bookings in 2013 would come from international customers, with foreign orders accounting for the “high 20 percent-range” of revenues. “Missile defense is something that is in demand in every place that I travel to,” Swanson said at the conference, adding that Raytheon was talking with customers about how they could maximize their missile systems, rather than just buying components. At the Dubai air show last month, a senior Raytheon official said the company expected to wrap up its talks about a possible Patriot missile defense system sale to Qatar “fairly quickly” and finalize the sale of additional Patriot units to Kuwait before the end of the year.

Qatar would become the fourth Gulf country to operate the Patriot system, joining the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Raytheon is also hoping to sell a ground-based air defense system for Oman. Swanson said some of the Middle East deals the company is hoping to complete soon are with new countries, which meant margins would start off in a lower range. He did not provide details. Wajsgras said Raytheon’s overall margins, before pension contributions, would remain strong at above 12 percent over the next three to five years. He said there was a “little bit of upward pressure” on margins given the company’s strong position in foreign markets and continued cost-cutting efforts, including efforts to work closely with its key suppliers.

202,RTN,Pentagon approves $1.1 billion Raytheon missile sale to Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon has approved the sale of more than 15,000 Raytheon Co anti-tank missiles to Saudi Arabia under two separate deals valued at nearly $1.1 billion. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign military sales, notified Congress on Thursday that it had approved Saudi Arabia’s request for nearly 14,000 tube-launched, optically tracked wire-guided (TOW) missiles for its national guard, and more than 1,700 similar missiles for the Royal Saudi Land Forces. The potential sales were announced during Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s current visit to the Gulf, aimed at underscoring the U.S. commitment to Middle East security. Lawmakers have 30 days to block the proposed sales, although such action is rare. “The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a critical partner who has been, and continues to be, an important force for political stability in the Middle East,” DSCA said on its website. The agency said Saudi Arabia would use the missiles to support defense and counterterrorism missions, strengthen its homeland defense and provide a deterrent to regional threats.

204,RTN,Merrill drops bid to advise Turkish defence firm after China deal-official,"ANKARA, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  has withdrawn from bidding to advise Turkish defence contractor Aselsan after Turkey struck a preliminary defence deal with a Chinese firm under U.S. sanctions, an Aselsan official said on Friday. Turkey, a member of NATO, said in September it had chosen an air and missile defence system built by China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp (CPMIEC) over rival offers from Franco-Italian Eurosam SAMP/T and U.S. firm Raytheon Co. Merrill Lynch had made a joint bid with Turkey’s Halk Investment to advise Aselsan on a planned secondary listing but has since written to the firm to say it was pulling out, the Aselsan official said, asking not to be named. “We have received five bids from brokerage houses. One of those was the Halk Investment-Merrill Lynch bid ... Due to the missile deal with China, Merrill Lynch has informed us that they pulled out,” the official said. Merrill Lynch officials in Turkey could not immediately be reached for comment. U.S. and NATO officials are unhappy with Turkey’s choice of CPMIEC, which is under U.S. sanctions for selling items to Iran, Syria or North Korea that are banned under U.S. laws to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Turkey has said the $3.4 billion Chinese deal offered the most competitive terms and would help it achieve its aim of building a stronger domestic defence industry by allowing co-production. But Turkish officials have made clear the decision is not yet final, keeping their options open by asking CPMIEC and its rivals to extend the validity of their bids.",12062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-defence-china-merrill/merrill-drops-bid-to-advise-turkish-defence-firm-after-china-deal-official-idUSL5N0JL1D620131206

207,RTN,UPDATE 2-Raytheon to keep next-generation jammer contract -U.S. Navy,"By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy on Friday said it was sticking with Raytheon Co as prime contractor for next-generation radar-jamming technology seen valued at billions of dollars in coming years, despite a November ruling by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) that upheld a protest against the award. Raytheon in July beat out BAE Systems and a team comprised of Northrop Grumman Corp and Exelis Inc  to win the Navy contract for the jamming system.  The GAO in November backed a BAE challenge of the contract, which was initially valued at $279 million but could be worth many multiples of that over coming decades, according to analysts “The Navy has completed corrective action as recommended by the GAO in the sustained protest filed by BAE Systems on the Next Generation Jammer Technology Development contract,” said Navy spokeswoman Commander Thurraya Kent. She said the Navy decided to stick with the Raytheon offer after carrying out a new cost and technical analysis of all three original bids, but gave no additional details. The new jammer will replace the Northrop-built ALQ-99 tactical jamming system now used on the EA-18G Growler aircraft built by Boeing Co. The jamming pods will enable U.S. aircraft to render enemy radars useless. “This confirms a huge breakthrough for Raytheon that potentially could generate over $10 billion in additional revenue during the next several decades,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute think tank. Thompson said he expected the program to survive the current difficult budget environment given the U.S. military’s need in wartime to prevent adversaries from tracking aircraft, communicating with ground forces or remotely detonating bombs. It was not immediately clear if BAE or Northrop would protest the Navy’s decision to keep Raytheon on the contract. No immediate comment was available from Raytheon. BAE spokeswoman Kristin Gossel said her company was weighing its options. “We protested the award based on concerns with the Navy’s evaluation of our offering and our protest was sustained by the GAO. We are disappointed with today’s decision and are currently considering all of our options,” Gossel said. Northrop, which had not protested the Navy’s award to Raytheon, said it was also disappointed by the decision. “While we are disappointed, we remain committed to continue to provide our warfighters with the lowest risk, most affordable solutions,” said Northrop spokesman Randy Belote. When the GAO, the congressional agency that oversees federal contract protests, ruled in favor of BAE in November, it said the Navy had failed to reasonably evaluate the risk of the proposals, improperly credited Raytheon with outdated performance data, and did not adequately document its decision.",1242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/raytheon-navy/update-2-raytheon-to-keep-next-generation-jammer-contract-u-s-navy-idUSL2N0KY1HW20140124

209,RTN,"UPDATE 2-Raytheon Q4 earnings beat estimates, foreign sales strong","By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. arms maker Raytheon Co  reported higher-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter on Thursday, although revenues fell short of estimates with U.S. military spending in decline. The company expected sales to drop further in 2014, but it said operating margins, international sales and profits would remain strong, buoyed partly by a sharp rise in pension income. Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras said the low point or “bottom” of U.S. military spending was likely from mid-2013 to mid-2014, echoing similar projections from top executives at Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, which reported earnings last week. He said a two-year budget agreement reached by Congress last year would help the U.S. government and arms makers plan better for the coming year. Raytheon said revenues were expected to drop to $22.5 billion to $23 billion in 2014 after falling 2.9 percent to $23.7 billion in 2013. Earnings from continuing operations were expected to rise to $6.74 to $6.89 per share, from $5.96 in 2013, boosted by a sharp rise in income from pension investments. Excluding pensions, earnings per share were likely to drop to $5.76 to $5.91 per share from $6.38 in 2013, the company said. Wajsgras told Reuters the company’s bookings exceeded sales by 28 percent in the fourth quarter, and that trend was likely to continue in the first half of 2014, with sales likely to show stronger growth in the second half. Raytheon now expects to finalize a large order from Kuwait for a Patriot missile defense system in February, a deal valued at $500 million to $600 million that had been expected in the fourth quarter, Wajsgras said. In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Raytheon shares were 25 cents higher, at $88.88. Chief Executive William Swanson, who will hand over the reins to Chief Operating Officer Tom Kennedy at the end of March, said Raytheon also expected to finalize a Patriot order valued at over $2 billion with Qatar in the first half of 2014. He told analysts international bookings would account for 35 percent to 40 percent of total orders in 2014, down from 43 percent in 2013, while foreign sales would account for about 30 percent of total sales, up slightly from 29 percent in 2013. Swanson said sales were expected to remain strong in the Middle East and Asia, but there could also be new orders from Europe and Australia in two or three years. Wajsgras said the company’s adjusted operating margin in 2013 was 13.4 pct, the highest level seen since 2000, which reflected efforts to cut costs by consolidating facilities and other measures. He said margins would likely ease to 12.6-12.8 percent in 2014 as the company began work on several new programs, which typically carry lower margins to start. Wajsgras said strong 2013 margins were a highlight of the year. “That bodes well for our customers because it reflects our ability to continue to take costs out,” he said. Swanson said Raytheon’s strong balance sheet put it in a good position for possible acquisitions of low- and mid-tier companies that are being squeezed by cuts in military spending. But he said the company was not looking to simply buy revenue. “Just to buy something for revenue sake, that never works,” Swanson said. “But where it fits in, especially where we see future growth, then that would be the case.” Raytheon reported nearly flat net profit from continuing operations of $467 million, while earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $1.46 from $1.41 a year earlier. Sales fell 8.8 percent to $5.87 billion from $6.44 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.35 on $5.95 billion in revenues, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Rob Stallard, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said the company’s guidance for 2014 was notably higher due to projected pension income. “This should more than offset any worries about reduced bookings, as the timing of awards is notoriously lumpy and difficult to predict,” he said. Wajsgras said the company was investing heavily in research and development, noting that past investments had helped the company win big U.S. Navy contracts — for a next-generation electronic jammer and a next-generation radar — in 2013.",1302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/raytheon-results/update-2-raytheon-q4-earnings-beat-estimates-foreign-sales-strong-idUSL2N0L40S320140130

So we’re going to have to go beyond that,” he said, although he gave no details.

216,RTN,Pentagon aims to replace Raytheon missile 'kill vehicle',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department’s fiscal 2015 budget includes $8.5 billion in funding for missile defense programs and reaffirms the Obama administration’s plan to build 14 additional ground-based interceptors by 2017. The budget request, which must still be approved by Congress, includes $99.5 million to start work on a new common “kill vehicle,” the top part of the ground-based interceptor that hits and destroys an incoming enemy missile on contact. The new kill vehicle would eventually replace the current one built by Raytheon Co, which has suffered several test failures, the Pentagon said in budget documents. It did not spell out which kill vehicle would be used on the 14 new interceptors to be built. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall told a conference last week that a new kill vehicle was needed, noting that the reviews of the program had revealed “bad engineering” on the current system. Missile defense is one of the biggest items in the Pentagon’s annual budget, although Republicans have faulted the Obama administration for scaling back funding in recent years. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the budget, which was informed by a major review of defense strategy, underscored the continued importance of missile defense, along with space, cyber and special operations, giving rapidly emerging threats. Boeing Co is the prime contractor for the U.S. ground-based missile defense system, while Raytheon builds the kill vehicle and Orbital Sciences Corp makes the rocket that launches it into space. Riki Ellison, chairman and founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, welcomed the funding increase for missile defense programs and said efforts to modernize the current ground-based system were overdue after its rushed initial deployment in 2004. “It unequivocally has to be modernized, redesigned and fully integrated to handle the upcoming advancing threats of Iran, North Korea and others,” Ellison said. Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp are already working on early designs of a new common kill vehicle. There were no immediate details on the acquisition plan for the redesigned kill vehicle, or KV, but the Pentagon said it would be built with a modular, open architecture and designed with common interfaces to make upgrades easier, and help broaden the vendor and supplier base. “The KV will improve reliability, be more producible and cost-effective, and will eventually replace the KV on the current ground-based interceptor fleet,” the Pentagon said in its budget plan. It said the next intercept test was planned for the third quarter of 2014, and it would focus on the reliability and performance of the ground-based missile defense system. The budget also kicks off a program for a new long-range radar to be deployed by 2020, providing initial funding of $79.5 million, and said it would invest in several initiatives aimed at addressing ballistic missile threats “that are expected to increase in numbers and complexity.” It also funds a seventh Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery built by Lockheed, and 31 THAAD interceptors, as well as 70 new Missile Segment Enhancement missiles built by Lockheed for a cost of $420 million. Raytheon builds the AN/TPY-2 radar used by the THAAD system.

Riki Ellison, chairman and founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, welcomed the funding increase for missile defense programs and said efforts to modernize the current ground-based system were overdue after its rushed initial deployment in 2004. “It unequivocally has to be modernized, redesigned and fully integrated to handle the upcoming advancing threats of Iran, North Korea and others,” Ellison said. Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp are already working on early designs of a new common kill vehicle. There were no immediate details on the acquisition plan for the redesigned kill vehicle, or KV, but the Pentagon said it would be built with a modular, open architecture and designed with common interfaces to make upgrades easier, and help broaden the vendor and supplier base. “The KV will improve reliability, be more producible and cost-effective, and will eventually replace the KV on the current ground-based interceptor fleet,” the Pentagon said in its budget plan. It said the next intercept test was planned for the third quarter of 2014, and it would focus on the reliability and performance of the ground-based missile defense system. The budget also kicks off a program for a new long-range radar to be deployed by 2020, providing initial funding of $79.5 million, and said it would invest in several initiatives aimed at addressing ballistic missile threats “that are expected to increase in numbers and complexity.” It also funds a seventh Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery built by Lockheed, and 31 THAAD interceptors, as well as 70 new Missile Segment Enhancement missiles built by Lockheed for a cost of $420 million. Raytheon builds the AN/TPY-2 radar used by the THAAD system.

The budget request, which must still be approved by Congress, includes $99.5 million for design of a new common “kill vehicle,” the top part of the ground-based interceptor that hits and destroys an incoming enemy missile on contact. The new kill vehicle would eventually replace the current kill vehicle built by Raytheon Co, which has suffered several test failures, the Pentagon said in budget documents.

223,RTN,"Pentagon to upgrade, improve U.S. missile defense system","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Missile Defense Agency on Tuesday mapped out plans to overhaul the ground-based U.S. missile defense system managed by Boeing Co and improve its reliability after several test failures in recent years. Missile Defense Agency Director Vice Admiral James Syring said the government was requesting about $300 million in fiscal 2015 to redesign the Raytheon Co “kill vehicle” that hits and destroys an enemy missile on contact, add a new long-range radar, and fund other measures to helping the system better identify, track and destroy potential enemy missiles. The agency’s budget request, which must still be approved by Congress, also funds longer-term initiatives to improve the system a decade after what were essentially prototypes to be rushed into operational use. Overall, the budget requests $8.5 billion for missile defense, including about $7.5 billion for the Missile Defense Agency. Missile defense is one of the biggest items in the Pentagon’s annual budget, although Republicans have faulted the Obama administration for scaling back funding in recent years. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the budget, which was shaped by a major review of defense strategy, underscored the continued importance of missile defense, along with space, cyber and special operations, giving rapidly emerging threats. Syring said the Bush administration’s decision to deploy the fledgling missile defense system in 2004 was aimed at countering “a very real threat,” but it cut short systems engineering and testing of the system. A slower process would have avoided some of the problems seen now, he said. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall told a conference last week that the reviews of the program had revealed “bad engineering” on the current system. Syring said reforms were needed now, especially given Hagel’s decision to add 14 more interceptors to the 30 in place in California and Alaska. “The final step now is to step back ... to now look at this from a bottoms-up design standpoint and not just keep making reliability improvements ... on the margin,” Syring said. He said the goal was to deploy a redesigned kill vehicle, new long-range radar and other measures by 2020. The Pentagon said the new kill vehicle would be built with a modular, open architecture and designed with common interfaces to make upgrades easier, and help broaden the vendor and supplier base. Syring said decisions would be made soon on how to proceed with the redesign of the kill vehicle, factoring in schedule, cost and price. He did not rule out a competition despite the tight schedule of buying 14 new interceptors by 2017. “I would not shy away from competition if that was the right answer,” Syring told reporters. He said the acquisition plan would help inform plans for buying the new interceptors, something now due to begin in fiscal 2016. The government’s funding of early design work on a new common kill vehicle by Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp meant the agency could choose from three “viable industry concepts,” he said. The fiscal 2015 budget also continues to fund that work, Syring said, noting that the effort was aimed at developing a kill vehicle that could be used on a ground-based interceptor, a Standard-Missile-3 or some future system. Syring said a review of a July 5 intercept failure was ongoing but officials were nearing an understanding of the root cause. It was not an issue involving simple quality problems, he said.

225,RTN,"UPDATE 2-Qatar buys helicopters, missiles in $23 bln arms deals","* U.S. firms get deals worth $7.6 bln * Boeing gets contract for 24 Apache attack helicopters * Lockheed, Raytheon also win contracts   (Adds details, in paragraphs 9-11, of additional weapons included) By Praveen Menon DOHA, March 27 (Reuters) - Qatar announced contracts worth about $23 billion on Thursday to buy attack helicopters, guided missiles, tankers and other weapons from Boeing Co, Airbus and other arms makers as the Gulf state accelerates its military build-up. The world’s top liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter announced deals with about 20 global companies, including firms from the United States which were awarded deals worth 27.5 billion riyals ($7.6 billion), said a spokeswoman for a Doha defense conference where the announcements were made. The weapons purchases include large deals with Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and others. Qatar, and other Gulf Arab and Middle Eastern countries are looking to acquire new high-tech military equipment to protect themselves from neighboring Iran and internal threats after the Arab Spring uprising. Boeing confirmed that the announcement included a contract to buy 24 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and three Boeing 737 Airborne early warning and control (AEW&C;) aircraft. The deal for the helicopters was valued at 8.9 billion riyals, said the spokeswoman for the conference. In Paris, France’s Defense Ministry said Qatar had agreed to buy 22 NH90 military helicopters from a unit of European aerospace group Airbus worth 2 billion euros ($2.76 billion) and two Airbus-made refueling tankers. NHIndustries is 62.5 percent owned by Airbus’ Eurocopter helicopter unit, 32 percent owned by AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy Finmeccanica’s and 5.5 percent by Stork Fokker. Qatar also committed to buy a Patriot missile defense system built by Raytheon equipped with PAC-3 missiles made by Lockheed; advanced daytime, high-definition sensors and radars for Apache helicopters; and Javelin missiles built by a Lockheed-Raytheon joint venture, according to sources familiar with the matter. Raytheon had told analysts in January that it expected to finalize an order with Qatar in the first half of 2014 for over $2 billion in Patriot missile defense system equipment. The Pentagon approved the sale to Qatar of $9.9 billion worth of Patriot fire units, radars, and various Raytheon and Lockheed missiles in November 2012. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the U.S. body which oversees foreign arms sales, had notified lawmakers in July 2012 of a possible sale of Apache helicopters to Qatar. A spokeswoman for the U.S. agency had no immediate comment. Washington has been keen to deepen its cooperation with Gulf nations, which have been long-standing allies, on missile defense and increase pressure on Iran over its nuclear program. The Apache helicopters are built by Boeing and used by the U.S. Army, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom. They will be fitted with Longbow radar equipment made by a joint venture of Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp.

226,RTN,Two U.S. arms programs face live-or-die reviews after costs jump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An unmanned U.S. Navy helicopter built by Northrop Grumman Corp and a precision ship-landing system built by Raytheon Co face mandatory reviews that could lead to their cancellation after quantity reductions drove unit costs sharply higher in 2013, the Pentagon announced on Thursday. Senior defense officials said the cost increases were largely due to cuts in the numbers of items to be purchased, but federal law required a careful look at program performance and other factors. The Nunn-McCurdy law requires a mandatory, 60-day live-or-die review if weapons systems see an increase of more than 25 percent in their unit costs. In order for programs to survive, top defense officials must certify that the program is needed for national security and meets other conditions. In this case, senior defense officials suggested that both programs would likely survive since the cost spikes were due to reduced orders, but they said final decisions would not be made until the reviews were completed on June 17. The Defense Department’s annual “selected acquisition report” on the cost of major weapons showed a slight 0.3 percent, or $4.4 billion, drop in the combined cost of 77 programs for a total cost of $1.62 trillion. The reduction was largely due to reduced quantities, changes in inflation rates, and reduced needs for support equipment, although they were partially offset by schedule delays and cost increases in other programs, including Lockheed Martin Corp’s F-35 fighter jet, the report showed. Senior defense officials said budget-driven reductions in arms programs had less effect on the program costs in 2013 than expected, although unit costs were likely to edge higher in coming years as mandatory spending reductions took effect. “I just don’t think we’re out of the woods yet,” said one official who was not authorized to speak publicly. “There will be effects on programs as budgets hold or come down further.” The Navy is buying 49 fewer Northrop Fire Scout helicopters after switching to a larger aircraft built by Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc, that can carry more than twice the fuel or cargo and can stay in the air for 12 hours. That compares to nearly five hours for the previous aircraft, which is no longer being produced. Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush said the program was going very well and the unit cost increase was due to the reduction in quantity. He said the Navy remained committed to the program and he expected it to survive the review now under way. The cut in quantities of Raytheon’s Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) came after the Army and Air Force decided to pull out of the joint program, which resulted in the need for 10 fewer shore-based training systems, the report said. The cost increase in the JPALS program also was partly due to an extension in the development program aimed at increasing the capability of the system, and higher material costs. Two other programs showed cost increases of more than 15 percent, requiring notification to Congress, but not triggering the more arduous cancellation reviews, the report showed. Boeing Co’s upgrade of the U.S. E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) saw a 19 percent jump in average unit procurement costs, mainly due to a reduction of seven airplanes, but also due to schedule changes, the report said. The cost of General Dynamics Corp’s Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) to build handheld and other smaller radios, rose 19 percent due to a revised acquisition strategy, it said. Lockheed’s F-35 fighter jet saw a $7.4 billion increase in acquisition costs to $398.6 billion, largely due to postponed orders from the U.S. military and international partners. The report showed a decrease of nearly 9 percent, or $97 billion, in the estimated cost of operating the F-35 aircraft through 2065. The Pentagon report estimated the total “lifecycle” cost of the U.S. F-35 fleet at $1.02 trillion, down from $1.11 trillion a year earlier, but the F-35 program office said improving reliability and other adjustments meant the number would be closer to $917 billion. Other changes included a $2.2 billion, or 4.2 percent, drop in the cost of Boeing’s KC-46A refueling plane, and a 9.5 percent rise in Boeing’s program to remanufacture AH-64 Apache helicopters, due to higher labor and material costs. The projected cost of the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship program dropped over 33 percent, or $11.3 billion, due to the Pentagon’s decision to halt orders after 32 ships instead of buying all 52 that had been planned.

229,RTN,"UPDATE 2-Raytheon posts higher profit, forecasts strong bookings","(Adds CEO comments from earnings call, updates stock price) By Andrea Shalal April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Co  reported higher first-quarter profit on Thursday after a tax credit and favorable pension adjustments and forecast strong bookings and a slight gain in margins for the rest of the year. But the company, which makes missiles and other military equipment, did not change its full-year forecast, which drove down shares more than 4 percent. Other defense stocks were more modestly lower. Raytheon said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $596 million, or $1.89 per share, from $488 million, or $1.49 a share, a year earlier. Excluding the tax and pension impact, earnings dropped to $1.43 per share from $1.56. Raytheon Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras told Reuters the company expected strong bookings and improved operating margins for the rest of this year after posting the highest quarterly earnings per share and cash flow in over a decade. Cash flow reached $659 million in the first quarter, up from $422 million a year earlier. The company expects full-year cash flow to reach $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. Wajsgras said the company’s international demand remained strong, and that foreign orders would account for nearly 30 percent of revenues and nearly 40 percent of bookings in 2014. Revenues fell 6.3 percent to $5.5 billion in the first quarter, a reflection of U.S. budget cuts, but Raytheon programs fared well in the 2015 U.S. budget proposal, Wajsgras said. Sales and operating income were down at three of Raytheon’s four business divisions. Operating profit at its information and services unit rose 1 percent despite a 5 percent drop in sales. The company still expected revenue to reach $22.5 billion to $23 billion for the full year, with earnings of $6.74 to $6.89 per share, or $5.76 to $5.91, excluding special items. Wajsgras said first-quarter bookings rose to $4.3 billion from $3.6 billion a year earlier due to a missile defense order from Kuwait and a cybersecurity order from an unnamed country. Bookings would likely top $7 billion in the second quarter. The company expected a slight improvement in operating margin over the course of the year, after the measure reached 14.3 percent in the first quarter, he said. Raytheon reported an operating margin of 12.4 percent for the 2013 year, up 20 basis points from the previous year. Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kennedy told analysts the company viewed acquisitions as a critical part of its long-term growth strategy, with a particular eye to expanding international and commercial sales in the cyber security area.

231,RTN,"Raytheon posts higher profit, forecasts strong bookings","(Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) reported higher first-quarter profit on Thursday after a tax credit and favorable pension adjustments and forecast strong bookings and a slight gain in margins for the rest of the year. Net income attributable to shareholders rose to $596 million, or $1.89 per share, from $488 million, or $1.49 a share, a year earlier. The company, which makes missiles and other military equipment, left its full-year forecast unchanged. Excluding the tax credit and pension items, which were previously announced, earnings dropped to $1.43 per share from Raytheon Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras said the company expected strong bookings and a slight gain in operating margins for the rest of this year after posting the highest quarterly earnings per share and cash flow in over a decade. Cash flow reached $659 million in the first quarter, up from $422 million a year earlier. Wajsgras told Reuters that the company’s international demand remained strong, and that foreign orders would account for nearly 30 percent of revenues and nearly 40 percent of bookings in 2014. Revenues fell 6.3 percent to $5.5 billion in the first quarter, a reflection of U.S. budget cuts, but Raytheon programs fared well in the 2015 U.S. budget proposal, Wajsgras said. Sales and operating income were down at three of its four business divisions, but its intelligence, information and services unit showed a 1 percent increase in operating income despite a 5 percent drop in sales. The company still expected revenue to reach $22.5 billion to $23 billion for the full year, with earnings of $6.74 to $6.89 per share, or $5.76 to $5.91, excluding special items. Wajsgras said first-quarter bookings rose to $4.3 billion from $3.6 billion a year earlier due to a large missile defense order from Kuwait and a big cybersecurity order from an undisclosed country. Bookings were expected to top $7 billion in the second quarter, he said. The company expected a slight improvement in operating margin over the course of the year, after the measure reached 14.3 percent in the first quarter, he said. Raytheon reported an operating margin of 12.4 percent for the 2013 year, up 20 basis points from the previous year. Rob Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said Raytheon’s decision to leave its full-year outlook unchanged could disappoint investors. To further lower costs, Raytheon plans to remove 10 percent of its global real estate square footage over the next three to four years, beginning with a reduction of about 2 percent in 2014, Wajsgras said. He said 3 percent had already been removed. He said the company was also continuing to whittle down the number of suppliers to lower costs and improve quality.

236,RTN,Budget-strapped Israeli military banks on future US aid,"* Pentagon chief Hagel visits Mideast ally next week * Israel says austerity drive hurts combat readiness By Dan Williams JERUSALEM, May 9 (Reuters) - Budget-strapped Israel is pressing the United States to conclude a deal extending defence aid beyond 2017, when Washington’s current $3 billion annual payouts to its Middle East ally expire, officials said on Friday. They said a swift agreement on future U.S. grants would help Israel’s military draft a five-year austerity plan accommodating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conservative government. “It’s difficult to budget into 2018 and 2019 without knowing what funds will be available,” an Israeli defence official said. U.S. Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel will visit Israel next week and the future aid will probably be raised by his hosts, according to a different official who declined to be identified by name or nationality. The previous Republican administration signed a 10-year deal with Israel in 2007 granting it $30 billion, most of it going on American defence products. U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, has sparred with Netanyahu over Iran’s nuclear programme and peacemaking with the Palestinians. But support for Israel’s security remains strong in Washington - even as policymakers there slash spending on a range of U.S. military programmes. “Our two nations are forever bound by our shared history and our shared values, and every American dollar spent on Israel’s security is an investment in protecting the many interests that our nations share,” U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Friday, concluding three days of consultations in Israel. Israel’s Defence Ministry and the U.S. embassy in Israel declined comment on the aid negotiations, which are under way. A U.S. official briefed on the talks and who spoke on condition of anonymity said Israel was seeking an overall increase to between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion a year, while the Obama administration had spoken of $2.8 billion. The allies would probably settle on $3 billion “or thereabouts,” the official predicted, adding that Israel “wants to get this worked out as soon as possible”. Israel’s defence budget of around $14.5 billion has been challenged by Finance Ministry demands to cut $870 million. Netanyahu’s security cabinet in December separately approved a $930 million boost to the defence budget, but the military says it needs more to contend with proliferating regional threats. “We cannot bridge this budget rift,” Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday. “There has been a mortal blow to training, to readiness and to fitness.” A senior Israeli military officer said the belt-tightening had put the brakes on David’s Sling, a missile interceptor  developed jointly with U.S. firm Raytheon Co. and which is being considered for purchase by Poland as it accelerates its defence preparations in response to the Ukraine-Russia standoff. David’s Sling could be operational in Israel in a year, the officer told reporters on Thursday - but only if more funds were found. “The moment you don’t have the money, you pull back on the development and on getting the kit in the field,” he said. In addition to the annual defence grants, Washington has separately helped bankroll Iron Dome, a shorter-range Israeli rocket interceptor system already deployed. Rice put the amount of U.S. funds earmarked for Iron Dome at nearly $900 million.

237,RTN,U.S. Air Force sees Space Fence choice soon: Lockheed or Raytheon,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado, May 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force on Wednesday said it is very close to choosing Lockheed Martin Corp or Raytheon Co to build a new ground-based radar to track satellites and other objects in space, a deal analysts value at nearly $2 billion. “It’s imminent,” Brigadier General Roger Teague, director of strategic plans, programs and analyses for Air Force Space Command, said in n interview after a panel session at a space conference hosted by the Space Foundation. U.S. military officials have underscored the importance of the Space Fence program, given the growing number of countries operating satellites in space and development of anti-satellite weapons, as well as the huge amount of debris in orbit. The new program will allow the Air Force to sharply increase its ability to track “space junk” and other smaller objects in space. Currently the Air Force tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects in space, but the new program would allow it to track hundreds of thousands of additional objects. Teague said the new radar system would give the Air Force far greater insight into what is going on in low earth orbit and over the southern hemisphere. Current plans call for the new system to be based on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 2,100 miles southwest of Honolulu, and to start operating in September 2018.

238,RTN,"U.S. tests enhanced Aegis system, fires SM-3 missile onshore","COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday announced the first live-fire test of a Raytheon Co SM-3 missile from the land-based version of Lockheed Martin Corp’s Aegis missile defense system, which will be operational in Romania next year. Lockheed said it was the first test of the Aegis system using a land-based missile launcher. The test at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) in Hawaii late on Tuesday marks a significant milestone for the Aegis Ashore weapon system, which is designed to protect U.S. and NATO forces in Europe from a ballistic missile attack. The Obama administration’s European Phased Adaptive Approach calls for the first Aegis Ashore site to be operational in Romania in 2015, with a second site to follow in Poland in 2018. A Pentagon spokesman, Colonel Steve Warren, said the test “is important because it’s similar to the system that’s being shipped to Romania for deployment by the end of next year.” During the test, the Aegis system used on U.S. warships around the world detected, tracked and engaged a simulated ballistic missile target using Raytheon’s Standard Missile 3 Block IB, according to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the companies. Shipment of the Aegis Ashore weapons to Romania will begin this summer, said Missile Defense Agency spokesman Rick Lehner. The test of the new system comes amid growing European interest in missile defense as tensions mount between NATO and Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine. Raytheon said an intercept flight test of the system would follow next year. It said the ability to use the SM-3 missile at sea and on land would give military commanders more flexibility. The land-based system uses the same SM-3 missile deployed on Aegis warships, and currently holds 24 SM-3 missiles at one time. The system can also be expanded to hold more launchers and missiles, Raytheon said. “The SM-3 Block IB deployed for the first time earlier this year at sea, and the success of this Aegis Ashore test keeps us on track to deploy the missile on land in 2015,” said Mitch Stevison, Raytheon’s Standard Missile-3 senior director.

243,RTN,Commercial approaches spur change in U.S. military space business,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., May 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. government’s growing acceptance of commercial military satellites is opening the $20 billion-a-year market to new companies and forcing big arms makers such as Lockheed Martin  and Boeing to change how they operate. U.S. officials are trying to boost security of U.S. military and intelligence satellites, with an eye on risks from space debris and the proliferation of space-faring countries that could target U.S. satellites in a war. Officials hope the booming commercial satellite market can help the government obtain simpler and cheaper satellites, lower the cost of launching and create more options in other areas. After years of talk, U.S. budget cuts and changes in technology have started to alter a market long dominated by big contractors like Lockheed. “The space market is changing dramatically,” said Henry Obering, senior vice president with Booz Allen Hamilton and former Missile Defense Agency director. “The big companies will either adopt new ways of doing things or they will fail.” “Change always creates angst,” said Doug Loverro, deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy. He said market giants were more open to commercial practices, cutting costs, speeding up programs and testing new technologies. For instance, he said the Air Force cut the cost of a new ground-based radar for tracking space objects by two thirds by mandating prototypes and manufacturing demonstrations. A contract award to Lockheed or Raytheon Co is expected soon. Lockheed, Boeing and others are embracing new production processes such as 3D printing, and hunting down commercial orders to offset an expected slowdown in U.S. government buying. Loverro said the Pentagon was still expected to spend about $300 billion on military space programs over the next 15 years, but buying practices will change to make satellites more “resilient.” “Do we continue to buy what we’ve been used to buying, or do we move in a different direction?” he said. He cited widespread agreement that the Air Force should stop buying Boeing-built Wideband Global System satellites since commercial satellites now carry more bandwidth. The Air Force is studying ways to use commercial bandwidth, beyond leasing services as it does during military operations. That could create opportunities for satellite operators like Iridium Communications, which plans to launch 66 new satellites starting in 2017 that will host payloads for the government or other customers. James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, said 90 percent of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s underlying intelligence now comes from companies like DigitalGlobe Inc.

244,RTN,Exclusive: Mercury Systems pulls sale - sources,"(Reuters) - Mercury Systems Inc, a supplier of digital signal and image processing systems to the aerospace and defense industry, has ended its exploration of a near-term sale, said three people familiar with the matter. Mercury, which has a market value of roughly $402 million, offers big data processing systems, software and services to companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and Raytheon Co. The Chelmsford, MA-based company ran an auction to sell itself, but a deal could not be reached because pricing expectations were not met, the people said. The people asked not to be named because the matter is not public. On an April 29 earnings call Chief Executive Officer Mark Aslett said Mercury could be shifting into acquisition mode. One of the people said this was tantamount to the company’s calling off the sale effort. Aslett said on the call that potential targets could be radio frequency or microwave transmission companies. Mercury’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were up 47 percent year over year, Aslett said on the call. Mercury Systems was working with a financial adviser on the sale and was seeking around $500 million, Reuters previously reported. The company was not immediately available for comment.

245,RTN,UPDATE 1-Lockheed beats Raytheon to win U.S. 'Space Fence' contract,"(Adds official announcement by Pentagon, reaction from Raytheon) WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - The Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, has won a $915 million contract to develop a ground-based radar for tracking objects in space for the U.S. Air Force, beating out a bid from Raytheon Co . The fixed-price contract, which includes an incentive fee, was announced late on Monday by the Pentagon in its daily digest of major contract awards. U.S. military officials have underscored the importance of the Air Force’s Space Fence program, given the growing number of countries operating satellites in space, China’s work on anti-satellite weapons, and the huge amount of debris in orbit. The new program will allow the Air Force to increase sharply its ability to track “space junk” and other smaller objects in space. Currently the Air Force tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects in space, but the new program would allow it to track hundreds of thousands of additional objects. Plans call for the new system to be based on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 2,100 miles southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, and to start operating in September 2018. Raytheon said it had been notified about the Air Force’s decision, but said it would be inappropriate to comment further until after it receives a post-decision debrief from Air Force officials.

247,RTN,UPDATE 2-Lockheed beats Raytheon to win U.S. 'Space Fence' contract,"(Adds Lockheed comment, byline) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp  on Monday beat out Raytheon Co to win a $915 million contract from the U.S. Air Force for a ground-based radar that will track about 200,000 pieces of old satellites and other objects in space. The Pentagon announced the fixed-price contract for the new “Space Fence,” which includes an incentive fee, late on Monday in its daily digest of major contract awards. The deal covers development and construction of the new radar on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 2,100 miles (3,400 km) southwest of Honolulu, with initial operations to start in late 2018. The deal also includes an option for a second site in western Australia, said Steve Bruce, vice president for advanced systems at Lockheed’s Mission Systems and Training Business. Bruce, speaking with reporters, declined to estimate the total value of the contract, including that option and others, but analysts said it would be worth just under $2 billion. U.S. officials have underscored the importance of the Space Fence program given the growing number of countries operating satellites in space, China’s work on anti-satellite weapons, and the huge amount of debris in orbit around the earth. The program will increase the U.S. government’s ability to track spent rocket boosters, dead satellites and other “space junk” that could damage satellites or the International Space Station, Bruce said. The Air Force now tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects orbiting the earth, but the new radar will increase that number tenfold. Brian Weeden, a former Air Force analyst who now works with the Secure World Foundation, said the new system still faced challenges, including the need for new computers to process the larger amount of data that will be collected. “There’s a lot that can still go wrong,” he said. Raytheon said it had been notified about the Air Force’s decision, but that it would be inappropriate to comment further until after it receives a post-decision debrief from Air Force officials. A company spokesman declined comment on whether it would protest the decision. Doug Loverro, deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, told Reuters last month that the Air Force cut the projected cost of the new radar system by two-thirds by mandating prototypes and manufacturing demonstrations. Bruce said the Air Force scaled back its requirements as a result of studies conducted by Lockheed and other companies in the early stages of the procurement process, ultimately deciding to use space-based assets to track debris in higher orbits. “The Air Force did a terrific job of looking at these requirements and coming up with something that’s affordable,” he said. Bruce declined to provide Lockheed’s expected profit on the deal, or other details of the contract terms, but said the fixed-price deal was unusual for a development project.

248,RTN,U.S. Navy names best-performing arms suppliers for 2014,"* Top weapons buyer says “No silver bullet” * U.S. Navy names General Dynamics, Lockheed units “superior suppliers” * Shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls fails to make U.S. Navy list By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy on Friday named units of top arms makers General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co as part of its list of the top-performing nine suppliers for 2014 based on their performance over the last three years. The Pentagon said on Friday it would use such public recognition of “superior suppliers,” incentives and competition as key tools in its ongoing drive to end years of cost overruns and schedule delays on key weapons programs. Top U.S. arms buyer Frank Kendall said the Navy developed the list as a pilot project this year, but he had asked the Air Force and Army to compile their own lists this year as part of the continuing effort to improve defense acquisition. “We want to recognize their performance, but we also want to motivate our performers who are not on that list to do better,” Kendall told reporters as he released a second annual report on the Pentagon’s procurement, development and operating budgets, which totalled over $350 billion in fiscal 2015 budget request. The nine companies also included units of General Electric , Northrop Grumman Corp, a venture of Lockheed and Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and Britain’s Rolls Royce Holdings Plc. One notable exception was Huntington Ingalls Industries , one of the Navy’s largest suppliers, and builder of aircraft carriers, submarines and other warships. Navy acquisition chief Sean Stackley said the suppliers that did make the list would be offered the chance to reduce certain contract requirements, including removal of some procedures, inspections or requirements, which could lead to cost savings. Kendall said the Pentagon had imposed affordability targets on 30 of its biggest programs and all but two or three were within those caps. But he said uncertainty about future budget levels continued to hamper more efficient investment decisions. He said the Pentagon remained focused on improving the way it buys hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons and services each year, but there was no single “silver bullet” to do that. Instead, he said the department needed to work on multiple fronts, including efforts to simplify the overlapping laws that govern defense acquisitions, better training for federal workers that administer contracts, and deeper analysis of past programs. “Defense acquisition is complicated and varying,” he wrote in the 116-page report. “We must empower, encourage and train our workforce to think - not dictate a cookbook that workforce members blindly follow.” The report cited good results from contracts with incentive fees, but said incentives were sometimes counterproductive and the Pentagon did not always use such measures as well as it could. Kendall also highlighted the importance of competition, but  said the department needed to get more creative about injecting competition into the process given declining defense budgets and growing consolidation in the industry.

Raytheon has missed the federal deadline to file a protest with the Government Accountability Office that would have triggered an automatic stop-work order on the contract, according to sources familiar with federal law and the timing of an Air Force briefing on the contract. The U.S. Air Force awarded the space-tracking Space Fence contract to Lockheed on June 2. Raytheon and Lockheed both declined comment.

The Air Force chose Lockheed to develop a ground-based radar that will track about 200,000 pieces of old satellites and other space junk.

251,RTN,U.S. missile defense system hits target in key test,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. missile defense system managed by Boeing Co on Sunday hit a simulated enemy missile over the Pacific in the first successful intercept test of the program since 2008, the U.S. Defense Department said. The successful intercept will help validate the troubled Boeing-run Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system which provides the sole U.S. defense against long-range ballistic missiles, and the Raytheon Co kill vehicle that separates from the rocket and hits an incoming warhead.     “This is a very important step in our continuing efforts to improve and increase the reliability of our homeland ballistic missile defense system,” said Missile Defense Agency (MDA)Director Vice Admiral James Syring. He said the agency would continue its ongoing drive to ensure that the ground-based interceptors and overall homeland defense system were effective and dependable. Reuters reported on Friday that the Pentagon is restructuring its $3.48 billion contract with Boeing for management of the missile defense system to put more emphasis on maintenance and reliability. Sunday’s high-stakes test came after the system had failed to hit a dummy missile in five of eight previous tests since the Bush administration rushed to deploy the system in 2004 to counter growing threats by North Korea. Earlier this month, Syring said that another test failure would have forced the Pentagon to reassess its plans to add 14 more interceptors to the 30 already in silos in the ground in Alaska and California. During the test, a long-range ground-based interceptor launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, intercepted an intermediate-range ballistic missile target launched from the U.S. Army’s Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Pentagon said. It said all components involved in the test appeared to have performed as designed. Program officials will spend the next several months assessing the performance of the system using telemetry and other data obtained during the test. The test marked the first successful intercept by Raytheon’s Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle Capability Enhancement II, or EKV CE-II, which failed in both previous tests conducted in 2010.  The companies involved had no immediate comment. Ten of the interceptors now in place carry the kill vehicle used in Sunday’s test. The other 20 carry an earlier kill vehicle that failed in a July 2013 test. Syring has said a fix will be implemented for that issue by year’s end. Riki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, hailed the successful test as a big step forward for the troubled program, and said it would allow U.S. military commanders to reduce the number of interceptors that would be fired at an incoming ballistic missile. “This success is a significant milestone ... that demonstrates the system’s reliability and increases the confidence of the North American Combatant Commander ... responsible for the defense of the country,” he said. Critics said the Raytheon kill vehicle had still only succeeded in one of three tries, and urged Congress to rethink plans to buy 14 more of the flawed interceptors at a cost of $75 million each, or just over $1 billion. “Would you spend $1 billion on an insurance policy that only worked one third of the time?” said Tom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association. “We need to put the money into making the system better, not bigger.” Phil Coyle, former Pentagon chief tester and a longtime critic, called for accelerated work on a new design. “We need to make sure we have a system that works, not expand a system we know to be deeply flawed,” he said in a statement.

252,RTN,Raytheon to resume production of warhead after successful test,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raytheon Co on Monday said it expects to soon resume production of an updated warhead, or “kill vehicle,” used for U.S. homeland missile defense after the system successfully intercepted a dummy target over the Pacific. “There are no other hurdles that we’re aware of, so we expect that we will go into production shortly,” Wes Kremer, vice president of air and missile defense systems at Raytheon, told reporters on a teleconference.  Raytheon is a subcontractor to Boeing Co on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, which defends the United States against long-range ballistic missiles and is projected to cost a total of $41 billion.  The system hit a simulated enemy missile on Sunday for the first time since 2008. Kremer said Raytheon had not been officially notified by the Missile Defense Agency about resuming production, but the test had clearly validated the revamped design of the kill vehicle, which separates from the ground-based interceptor and hits an incoming warhead. The Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle Capability Enhancement II, EKV CE-II, is already carried by 10 of the 30 U.S. interceptors already in silos in Alaska and California, but it had failed to hit its target in two previous flight tests in 2010. The earlier version of the kill vehicle, the CE-I, which is on the remaining 20 interceptors, failed its last intercept test in July 2013, but the government says it expects to correct the problem that caused that failure by year’s end. Kremer said he was not aware of any plans to test the CE-1 kill vehicle. He said Raytheon is keen to compete for work on a new kill vehicle design that the agency has said it plans to pursue and field by 2017 or 2018. “This test ... does not negate the need to do a redesign to improve the overall reliability of the kill vehicle,” Kremer said, adding that Raytheon would use its experience with the Standard Missile-3 to improve the GMD warhead’s reliability. He said the kill vehicles in use now were designed to be autonomous, but technology advances since then would allow the new warhead to be more tightly integrated into the overall U.S. missile defense system.Reuters reported on Friday the Pentagon is restructuring its $3.48 billion contract with Boeing for management of the missile defense system to put more emphasis on maintenance and reliability.

254,RTN,"UPDATE 2-Poland short-lists Raytheon, Thales in missile system tender","* Bids from Lockheed Martin and Israel are dropped * Tender was revised after Russia intervened in Ukraine * Poland choosing operational systems over advanced technology   (Recasts, updates with statement from losing consortium) By Marcin Goettig WARSAW, June 30 (Reuters) - Poland has short-listed a consortium of France’s Thales and European group MBDA, as well as U.S. firm Raytheon, in its tender for a mid-range missile defence system, the defence ministry said on Monday. The bids that lost out on the tender, which is estimated to be worth about $5 billion, were from the Israeli government and the MEADS consortium led by Lockheed Martin. Poland, a NATO member since 1999, had accelerated the process to select a supplier for the missile system after Russia’s intervention in Ukraine prompted fears among NATO members in eastern Europe they could be next in line. The Polish defence ministry also changed the criteria for the system, saying it should be already operational and in use by a NATO member state’s armed forces. That ruled out the Lockheed Martin-led bid, which involved technology still in development, and the Israeli bid, called David’s Sling, which is also not yet in operation. The ministry said terms of the tender will ensure the participation of Poland’s domestic defence industry in the construction of the missile defence, with the state defence holding Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa playing a key role. Raytheon welcomed the announcement. “We are moving ahead to provide Poland with the most advanced air and missile defense system in use today by 12 countries around the world,” said Dan Crowley, President, Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems. “And (we) look forward to partnering with the Polish industry to build the next generation Patriot system.” The first phase of the Polish system, know in Poland as Wisla, is for eight sets of mid-range interceptor rockets, which may later be supplemented by short-range ones. Poland has already passed legislation to secure funding for the system, the ministry said earlier this year. MEADS International issued a statement saying it was disappointed with Poland’s announcement, but that it would keep working with existing national partners Germany and Italy to finish development of the system. “Today’s announcement reflects new criteria for the Wisla selection, and should they change again, we stand ready with the most advanced air and missile defence system available today.” The planned system is separate from elements of a U.S. missile shield to be deployed in Poland by 2018, as confirmed by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on a visit to Warsaw this week.

257,RTN,Raytheon sees foreign sales at 30 percent of total in 2014,"FARNBOROUGH England (Reuters) - Raytheon Co, maker of Patriot missiles and a range of other defense electronics, expects international sales to expand to 30 percent of its revenue in 2014, up from 27 percent last year, Chief Executive Tom Kennedy said in an interview. Kennedy said the company hoped to continue expanding international sales beyond the 30-percent level by increasing its presence in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, adding more co-production agreements and beefing up its global supply chain. “We’re trying to drive that (increase). Every five percent is like a glass ceiling you have to break through,” Kennedy said at the Farnborough air show. “To do the next step you have to have boots on the ground.”  Raytheon executives plan 700 meetings with 1,800 people at the Farnborough Airshow about business in five key areas: air and missile defense, cyber, electronic warfare, communications, intelligence and surveillance, and “effects” or weapons like the small diameter bomb on the F-35 fighter. On Monday, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said its Sentinel surveillance aircraft that helped hunt for 200 missing schoolgirls in Nigeria would remain in service for three more years until 2018, with Raytheon set to improve the plane’s software and make it better equipped for maritime surveillance. The company also got a big boost last week when Poland short-listed Raytheon’s Patriot missile defense system and a consortium of France’s Thales and European group MBDA, in its competition for a new mid-range missile defense system. It remains in the running for a large missile defense competition underway in Turkey, which recently asked bidders to extend their offerings through Aug. 30. Kennedy said Raytheon was working with suppliers and cutting its own costs to ensure that it was able to maintain the pricing offered in its Patriot bid, and continued to work closely with the Turkish government on that offering. He said Raytheon already used suppliers to provide components for other weapons systems in Turkey, and had offered Turkey substantial co-production prospects if it won the bid. Turkey last year said it would negotiate with a Chinese firm for a new missile system, but later said it had not yet made a final decision after U.S. and NATO officials said the system would not be able to operate with NATO equipment. In addition to pressing for more foreign sales, Raytheon remains focused on cutting costs, consolidating facilities and making its operations more efficient as it grapples with mandatory budget cuts in the United States, Kennedy said. In the United States, Raytheon is awaiting details on how the Pentagon plans to upgrade the kill vehicles or warheads on ground-based interceptors used in its missile defense system. The U.S. military on June 22 carried out its first successful test since 2008 of the new kill vehicle that is used on 10 of 30 ground-based interceptors that have already been deployed. Twenty other interceptors carry an earlier version of the Raytheon warhead, which failed in an test one year ago. The Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, Frank Kendall, told reporters on Sunday he hoped to fund a much more reliable kill vehicle for the missile defense system run by Boeing Co, but said the acquisition approach would depend largely on cost.

258,RTN,UPDATE 1-AIRSHOW-Raytheon sees foreign sales at 30 pct of total in 2014,"(Adds quotes, background) By Andrea Shalal FARNBOROUGH, England, July 14 (Reuters) - Raytheon Co , maker of Patriot missiles and a range of other defense electronics, expects international sales to expand to 30 percent of its revenue in 2014, up from 27 percent last year, Chief Executive Tom Kennedy said in an interview. Kennedy said the company hoped to continue expanding international sales beyond the 30-percent level by increasing its presence in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, adding more co-production agreements and beefing up its global supply chain. “We’re trying to drive that (increase). Every five percent is like a glass ceiling you have to break through,” Kennedy said at the Farnborough air show. “To do the next step you have to have boots on the ground.” Raytheon executives plan 700 meetings with 1,800 people at the Farnborough Airshow about business in five key areas: air and missile defense, cyber, electronic warfare, communications, intelligence and surveillance, and “effects” or weapons like the small diameter bomb on the F-35 fighter. On Monday, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said its Sentinel surveillance aircraft that helped hunt for 200 missing schoolgirls in Nigeria would remain in service for three more years until 2018, with Raytheon set to improve the plane’s software and make it better equipped for maritime surveillance. The company also got a big boost last week when Poland short-listed Raytheon’s Patriot missile defense system and a consortium of France’s Thales and European group MBDA, in its competition for a new mid-range missile defense system. It remains in the running for a large missile defense competition underway in Turkey, which recently asked bidders to extend their offerings through Aug. 30. Kennedy said Raytheon was working with suppliers and cutting its own costs to ensure that it was able to maintain the pricing offered in its Patriot bid, and continued to work closely with the Turkish government on that offering. He said Raytheon already used suppliers to provide components for other weapons systems in Turkey, and had offered Turkey substantial co-production prospects if it won the bid. Turkey last year said it would negotiate with a Chinese firm for a new missile system, but later said it had not yet made a final decision after U.S. and NATO officials said the system would not be able to operate with NATO equipment. In addition to pressing for more foreign sales, Raytheon remains focused on cutting costs, consolidating facilities and making its operations more efficient as it grapples with mandatory budget cuts in the United States, Kennedy said. In the United States, Raytheon is awaiting details on how the Pentagon plans to upgrade the kill vehicles or warheads on ground-based interceptors used in its missile defense system. The U.S. military on June 22 carried out its first successful test since 2008 of the new kill vehicle that is used on 10 of 30 ground-based interceptors that have already been deployed. Twenty other interceptors carry an earlier version of the Raytheon warhead, which failed in an test one year ago. The Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, Frank Kendall, told reporters on Sunday he hoped to fund a much more reliable kill vehicle for the missile defense system run by Boeing Co, but said the acquisition approach would depend largely on cost. Kennedy said Raytheon believed it could help lower the cost of the kill vehicle and improve its reliability by drawing on its experience with the successful Standard Missile-3, but said it would wait to see the Pentagon’s requirements.

260,RTN,UPDATE 1-AIRSHOW-UK to extend Sentinel surveillance programme with Raytheon support,"(Adds CEO comments, MoD confirmation) FANRBOROUGH, England, July 14 (Reuters) - Britain’s Ministry of Defence said its Sentinel programme would remain in service until 2018, giving the country three more years of the surveillance aircraft capability which it recently used in Nigeria to help look for 200 missing schoolgirls. Raytheon Co, the U.S. maker of radar, missiles and other defence electronics, said it would improve software on the Sentinel to make it better equipped for maritime surveillance to help support the government’s plan to extend its lifespan. Britain, which had planned to retire Sentinel in 2015, did not put a figure on how much it was paying to fund the extension but said the bill would be covered by a 1.1 billion pound ($1.9 billion) defence investment announced earlier on Monday. The new money would help bolster the country’s ability to respond to threats such as global terrorism, the government said. Britain has cut defence spending by around 8 percent over the last four years as part of a government plan to reduce a record budget deficit and had proposed retiring Sentinel, operated by the Royal Air Force, as a cost-saving measure in its 2010 defence review. Sentinel has been deployed by Britain in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali and more recently Nigeria. Raytheon CEO Tom Kennedy welcomed Britain’s decision and said it reflected the airplane’s performance, reliability and proven intelligence-gathering and communications capabilities during military engagements, as well as in monitoring UK flooding. “The Sentinel has been a tremendous asset to the UK,” Kennedy told Reuters.

The gains helped major averages erase the week’s losses as buying intensified as the day came to a close. The CBOE market volatility index fell 5.7 percent to 15.71 in a sign of reduced investor uncertainty. Stocks have been under pressure of late as investors, worried about high valuations and uncertainty around the world, pulled back from riskier assets. Before Friday’s rally, the S&P; 500 had given up more than 4 percent while the small-cap Russell was down 7 percent over the past four weeks. Markets rallied after Russia’s Defense Ministry said Friday it had finished military exercises in southern Russia, which the United States had criticized as a provocative step amid the Ukraine crisis. “The market hates uncertainty, and when it doesn’t have enough information about how badly an event could impact the economy, it tends to take the worst-case scenario and people sell off,” said Malcolm Polley, president and chief investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors in Indiana, Pennsylvania. “With the news of the de-escalating in Russia, and also with the administration saying exactly what they are doing in Iraq, it’s helped clear up some uncertainty in the market.” Earlier on Friday, the United States carried out air strikes targeting Islamic State fighters marching on Iraq’s Kurdish capital. The strikes were the first authorized on Iraq since President Barack Obama pulled American troops out in 2011. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 182.52 points, or 1.12 percent, to 16,550.79. The S&P; 500 ended up 21.84 points, or 1.14 percent, to 1,931.41. The Nasdaq Composite  added 36.02 points, or 0.83 percent, to 4,370.99. For the week, the Dow rose 0.4 percent, the S&P; 500 gained 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq rose 0.4 percent. Utilities were the day’s biggest gainer among S&P; sectors, rising 2 percent, followed by a 1.7 percent increase in energy shares. Shares of defense companies also performed well, with Lockheed Martin Corp ending the day up 1.8 percent to $165.80, Raytheon Co up 2.4 percent to $91.61 and Northrop Grumman Corp up 2.1 percent to $122.86. U.S.-traded shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp  surged 45.1 percent to $20.70 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the company’s experimental Ebola treatment for potential use in humans.

Britain canceled its contract with Raytheon in 2010 for eBorders, a border-control system aimed at thwarting terrorism by collecting advance information on passengers traveling to the UK, saying the company was in default. Raytheon later sued the government for 500 million pounds in damages, arguing that it had met its obligations on the program, which has continued to be dogged by problems. In its release, Raytheon said the UK Arbitration Tribunal denied all Home Office claims for damages and clawback of previous payments made to Raytheon Systems Ltd (RSL). It also found that the Home Office had wrongfully retained the 50 million pounds ($83 million) it had drawn on Raytheon letters of credit in April 2011, but did not rule on the cost and interest payable to the company as a result. “The Tribunal’s ruling confirms that RSL delivered substantial capabilities to the UK Home Office under the eBorders program.

268,RTN,"U.S. report rips Boeing, Raytheon quality controls on missile defense","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon’s internal watchdog on Monday said it found numerous quality control problems during an investigation of the troubled “kill vehicle”, or warhead, built by Raytheon Co for the Boeing Co-led U.S. missile defense system. In the report, the Pentagon’s inspector general said quality standards were not met in 48 specific cases, involving issues that ranged from software testing, supply chain requirements and management of design changes that made the kill vehicle “suspectible to quality assurance failures.” It said the U.S. Missile Defense Agency agreed with its concerns and had already moved to address 44 of the 48 issues as part of a larger drive to improve quality controls. The report was the first of two to be completed by the inspector general’s office on the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) program, which completed the first successful intercept test in June after years of failures. The 28-page report chronicled the history of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) missile defense system, which was deployed in 2004 before it completed testing to counter what the administration of former President George W. Bush identified as a looming North Korean missile threat. “A combination of cost constraints and failure-driven program restructures has kept the program in a state of change. Schedule and cost priorities drove a culture of ‘use-as-is’ leaving the EKV as a manufacturing challenge,” the report said.  “With more than 1,800 unique parts, 10,000 pages of work instructions, and 130,000 process steps for the current configuration, EKV repairs and refurbishments are considered by the program to be costly and problematic and make the EKV susceptible to quality assurance failures,” it said. The report said most quality management systems on the weapons system were in compliance, but problems were evident. The report found 15 major and 25 minor quality problems with Raytheon’s handling of the program, including one case where a manufacturing operation had to be stopped because the parts kit - which had been audited - included a screw without threads. In another case, the specifications for one sensitive part were missing critical requirements banning use of X-ray inspection during commercial flights. It found six major problems and one minor with Boeing’s work, and one major issue with the agency’s oversight. Most of the issues have already been corrected, the report said, but Raytheon is still working on four issues. Raytheon said it was aware of the report but had no immediate comment. Boeing could not be reached. The report comes as the Pentagon weighs how to move ahead on its effort to develop a more reliable kill vehicle - a project that shakes up the current industry team.

274,RTN,Raytheon wins $149 million deal to source Iron Dome parts,"WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor Raytheon Co on Tuesday said it had won a $149 million contract from Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd to provide key parts for the Tamir interceptor used in the Iron Dome missile defense system. The contract, which builds on a co-marketing agreement the two companies signed in 2011, calls for Raytheon to use its extensive supplier networks to provide a second source of essential components for the Tamir interceptor. The Iron Dome system is credited with over 1,000 successful intercepts. Details were finalized on Monday, Raytheon said. “Iron Dome has proven itself time and again by protecting Israel’s population from incoming rockets, artillery and mortars,” Taylor Lawrence, president of Raytheon Missile Systems, said in a statement. “The sourcing of Tamir interceptor components in the U.S. will go a long way to ensuring sufficient volumes of available Tamir missiles for Israel’s defense.” The deal was negotiated under Raytheon’s co-marketing agreement with Rafael, but stops short of a larger co-production deal that has been under discussion since U.S. lawmakers conditioned more than $680 million in earlier U.S. funding for Iron Dome on production of some components in the United States. Raytheon declined to comment further. Rafael CEO DiDi Yaari said the cooperation between the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Israeli Missile Defense Organization had been “extraordinary” and Israelis appreciated U.S. support for the system.

279,RTN,Raytheon wins deal for next-generation U.S. Air Force radar,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N) beat out Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) for a contract to build a next-generation long-range radar system for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Defense Department said on Monday. The award marks another significant win for Raytheon in the radar market, a deal valued at around $1 billion, and kicks off the next phase of a program begun in 2009, when the Air Force funded work on full-scale prototypes by all three companies. The new system will replace the Air Force’s current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s. It will serve as the Air Force’s primary long-range, ground-based sensors for detecting and tracking aircraft and missiles. The Air Force said the new system would be more accurate, reliable and give air controllers a precise real-time view. Raytheon’s initial $19.5 million deal, which runs through Oct. 31, 2018, will cover continued development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) program, and construction of three initial systems. The Air Force then plans to buy three more systems for a total of $72 million. Over time, the value of the contract is likely to rise significantly since the Air Force is expected to order 30 more radar systems, and foreign militaries could soon follow suit since the system was designed from the start to allow exports. Loren Thompson with the Lexington Institute said the contract was the latest in “Raytheon’s impressive string of competitive wins” and marked the third setback in a row for Northrop. “Raytheon is steadily taking market share in the midst of a defense downturn,” he said. Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the new radar embodied concepts mapped out in a new strategic framework, including the need to design “exportability” into weapons early on to lower the cost of buying and maintaining weapons systems.  Raytheon welcomed the news, saying it had developed an “affordable, exportable radar” that would meet the requirements of many U.S. allies and could work together with older systems. Raytheon said using gallium-nitride allowed the firm to improve the range, sensitivity and search capabilities of the radar without excessive cost. It also operates in the relatively uncongested C-band of the radio frequency spectrum. “As the U.S. and other countries look to replace aging battlefield radars with low-cost yet cutting edge and highly capable systems, Raytheon’s 3DELRR can meet that growing demand,” said Andrew Hajek, who heads the program for Raytheon. Hajek told Reuters the competition had been “tough but fair.” He declined to give any financial details. Lockheed said it was disappointed by the news, but said it was waiting for a briefing from the Air Force before deciding whether to protest with the congressional Government Accountability Office (GAO).

282,RTN,Raytheon eyes deal with Qatar on Patriot system before year-end,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N) expects Qatar and the U.S. government to complete a long-awaited multibillion-dollar agreement on a “significant” number of Patriot missile defense systems before year end, a senior company official told Reuters on Tuesday. Tim Glaeser, vice president with Raytheon’s integrated defense systems business, gave no exact details on the cost and number of Patriot batteries involved, but said he expected the two sides to reach a deal within the next four to eight weeks. Former Raytheon Chief Executive Bill Swanson had told analysts in January that he expected Qatar to finalize an order worth over $2 billion in the first half of 2014. But foreign military sales often take longer than expected to close. The Patriot sale to Qatar was part of a $23 billion weapons package announced by Qatar in March that includes Boeing Co (BA.N) attack helicopters and Javelin missiles built by a Raytheon-Lockheed Martin Corp joint venture.(LMT.N)  Qatar is beefing up its defenses to counter a growing perceived threat from Iran. The Pentagon first approved the sale of up to $9.9 billion worth of Patriot batteries and other equipment in late 2012. Once the Raytheon deal is finalized, Qatar will become the 13th country to operate the Patriot missile defense system, and the fourth of six Gulf Cooperation Council members to opt for it, Glaeser said. He said Qatar’s decision to choose the Patriot over rival systems, including the Medium Extended Air Defense System developed jointly by the United States, Germany and Italy, sent “a pretty significant message” about the continued relevance of the Patriot system, which has been upgraded in recent years.  Glaeser said Raytheon was also in talks with Saudi Arabia about additional Patriot batteries under a separate commercial sale. The United Arab Emirates have already ordered the updated Patriot system, and Kuwait is also upgrading its capabilities. Gulf countries have been looking at creating a regional missile defense system that would link existing Patriot systems and other equipment in the region, Glaeser  said, but no final decisions have been made.

284,RTN,Foreign sales may offset U.S. cost of Raytheon radar-US Air Force,"WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force said foreign sales of 50 to 100 of the new long-range radar systems to be developed by Raytheon Co could help lower the cost of U.S. purchases in coming years. Dave Allen, the Air Force’s lead engineer for the next-generation radar program, said in an interview on Tuesday that the program was designed from the start with “anti-tamper” features and other equipment to enable easier exports. Allen declined to name potential customers, but said many countries would need to replace current radar systems built by Raytheon and its rivals, Northrop Grumman Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp as they reached the end of their service lives, normally about 20 to 25 years. Raytheon declined comment on possible targets for foreign sales of the new radar system, the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR), which will serve as the Air Force’s primary long-range, ground-based sensors for detecting and tracking aircraft and missiles. The Pentagon on Monday said Raytheon had beat out Northrop and Lockheed to replace the Air Force’s current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s. Air Force officials said they structured the radar competition carefully to avoid changing requirements and to make Air Force priorities clear to the bidding companies. Officials will brief all three companies next week. Northrop and Lockheed have said they will await those briefings before deciding whether to protest the contract loss. “There’s nothing you can do to prevent protests,” said Elizabeth Kent, a senior Air Force contracting officer. “The best you can do is mitigate your risk.” Kent said the Air Force award was based on a careful assessment of the technical characteristics of the radar, and the risks involved, a move aimed at making the decision less subjective. “In the end, it came down to cost and price.” Kent and other Air Force officials declined to give any details about why the Raytheon bid won out, saying only that the winning proposal was “technically acceptable with the lowest price.” One key requirement for the new radar called for 94.7-percent operational reliability, and a mean time of 495 hours between critical failures.

302,RTN,Exclusive: Pentagon to review Raytheon GPS ground system after cost spike,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Thursday said it had ordered a review of  Raytheon Co’s work on a new ground control system for Global Positioning System satellites after an Air Force-ordered restructuring drove the program’s cost significantly higher. The current contract value is $1.6 billion, according to Air Force officials, which marks an increase of over 80 percent from the initial contract value of $886 million. Frank Kendall, the Pentagon’s chief arms buyer, on Tuesday ordered a “deep dive” review, starting in January, of the next-generation GPS Operational Control System (OCX) that Raytheon is developing, according to his spokeswoman, Maureen Schumann. Kendall told an investor conference in New York on Tuesday that most U.S. weapons programs were within 2-3 percent of their cost targets, but he was keeping an eye on one program that was “significantly over.” He did not name the program. Schumann told Reuters on Thursday that Kendall was referring to the Raytheon OCX program. The U.S. Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center awarded Raytheon a contract in February 2010 to develop the hardware and software needed to control U.S. GPS satellites and ensure the security of their signals, but the program has run into technical challenges and cost increases. Including options, the total contract was initially valued at $1.5 billion. The Air Force this summer restructured the OCX program, increasing the value of the base contract by 80.5 percent from $886 million to $1.6 billion, and delaying its completion by two years to 2018.  A spokeswoman for the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center confirmed the contract value was now $1.6 billion, and said it included options for further work. She did not spell out the percentage increase or the value of the options.  Raytheon said it had worked closely with the Air Force to modify the cost and schedule baseline and incorporate new Department of Defense (DOD) cyber security requirements. “The revised contract reflects the complexity of implementing the DOD’s most rigorous cyber requirements coupled with improvements to our systems engineering and software development approach,” Matt Gilligan, Raytheon’s GPS-OCX program, said in a statement. Gilligan said the company had successfully completed four of five exercises to prove the system’s readiness for launch, and is due to start formal qualification tests in early 2015.

303,RTN,"Pentagon faults both Raytheon, Air Force for program cost growth","WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Pentagon’s chief arms buyer on Friday faulted both Raytheon Co and the U.S. Air Force for sharp cost growth on a new ground station for Global Positioning System satellites, citing problems with program execution and changes in requirements. Reuters reported on Thursday that Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall this week ordered a review of Raytheon’s GPS Operational Control System after the contract’s value increased by over 80 percent to $1.6 billion. Kendall told reporters on Friday the review was aimed at ensuring the program was now properly structured. “I want to make sure that it’s on track ... and I’m also looking for lessons learned,” he said. Kendall said the cost growth on the program was due to both “execution issues” on the part of the contractor, and changes in requirements by the Air Force. He said he had spoken with Raytheon’s management about the program, and the company had agreed to provide additional resources to ensure the program’s success. He did not elaborate.

Raytheon said it had worked closely with the Air Force to incorporate new cybersecurity requirements for the system. Kendall gave no details on how the system’s requirements had changed, but suggested that cybersecurity requirements should have been addressed when the program was first being shaped. “Sometimes requirements change because the world has changed, and there’s a new threat. Then you can ask yourself, ‘Should we have anticipated that? Should we have been on top of that ahead of time?’”       (Reporting by Andrea ShalalEditing by Jonathan Oatis)",12052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/raytheon-space/pentagon-faults-both-raytheon-air-force-for-program-cost-growth-idUSL2N0TP24220141205
304,RTN,"UPDATE 1-BAE, Navantia, Raytheon to up role in Australian shipbuilding","* Plan to get troubled $7 bln programme back on track * Project has been blighted by long delays and cost blowouts * Defence minister plans sovereign submarine building industry   (Adds more details on destroyer and submarine programmes) By Jane Wardell SYDNEY, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Defence contractors BAE Systems Plc, Navantia SA and Raytheon Co will increase their roles in Australia’s A$8.5 billion ($7 billion) warship building project as the country tries to get the troubled programme back on track. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Tuesday the trio’s increased involvement will drive immediate improvements in shipbuilding performance, without giving any financial details of their expanded contracts. Australia’s Air Warfare Destroyer project has been blighted by long delays and cost blowouts. An auditor’s report earlier this year found that local shipyards were not fully prepared to take on the complex work, while Spain’s Navantia provided poor blueprints marred by “drawing errors or omissions” and late changes. “The good news is we have turned a corner,” Cormann told reporters. “We’re committed to stop the growing scheduling and cost overruns.” BAE, Navantia and Raytheon were chosen to increase their involvement after a competitive procurement process, Cormann said. Navantia will contribute design function skills, BAE will coordinate shipbuilding and Raytheon will offer management skills. Raytheon was already part of the programme’s AWD Alliance, rounded out by government military purchaser Defence Materiel Organisation and government-owned shipbuilder Australian Submarine Corp (ASC). Defence Minister David Johnston said the kickstart to the destroyer programme was the first step of a plan aimed at restoring the future of naval maritime capability in Australia, including the creation of a “sovereign industry around submarines.” Johnston declined to comment when asked if that meant the country’s next submarines would be built in Australia. The defence minister was forced to apologise last month after saying he would not trust ASC “to build a canoe”, comments that fuelled expectations that most of the work in an A$40 billion programme will go offshore. Reuters reported in September that Australia was leaning toward buying as many as 12 off-the-shelf stealth submarines from Japan. Prime Minister Tony Abbott had previously pledged the submarines would be built in South Australia, where unemployment exceeds the national average, but his government began back-pedalling in July, signalling cost and schedule were paramount. Tuesday’s announcement came as results from a by-election indicated that Abbott’s Liberal Party may concede a majority government to the opposition Labor Party in South Australia. Johnston, who has faced increasing pressure to step down from his portfolio, said more detail on the defence programme would be provided in the government’s Defence White Paper, due out next year.

311,RTN,Exclusive: U.S. Air Force to reevaluate bids in protested radar deal - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force has agreed to reevaluate proposals received in a competition for a long-range radar system initially won by Raytheon Co (RTN.N), after two losing bidders filed protests, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The Air Force’s action is expected to resolve the two separate protests, which were filed by Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) days after the contract was first awarded to Raytheon in October, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The decision followed a series of hearings held by the Government Accountability Office, the congressional agency that evaluates federal contract disputes. “The Air Force is taking corrective action,” said one of the sources. The protesting companies were now evaluating the proposed actions to determine whether they would render their protests moot, the source added. Attorneys for the companies involved declined comment, as did spokesmen for the Air Force and the GAO. It was unclear how long the Air Force reevaluation of the bids would take, but one source said it could include a more technical assessment of proposals submitted by the companies. Raytheon in October beat out Northrop and Lockheed to develop a replacement for the Air Force’s current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s.  The new radar will serve as the Air Force’s primary long-range, ground-based sensors for detecting and tracking aircraft and missiles. The value of the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) contract is limited now but could eventually rise to about $1 billion, given the Air Force’s plan to buy 30 of the new systems in coming years.  Orders from foreign militaries for as many as 100 of the new systems could further expand the value of the contract, one of few new large acquisition programs awarded by the Air Force.

315,RTN,UPDATE 2-U.S. Air Force to re-evaluate bids in radar contract,"(Adds reaction from Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, paragraphs 6-8) WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force confirmed on Wednesday that it would re-evaluate bids it had received for a long-range radar system, resolving protests filed by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman about a contract won by Raytheon in October. The Air Force said a new round of discussions with bidders on technical evaluations and pricing analysis may take about four months. It said it was taking the action after feedback from the Government Accountability Office, the congressional agency that reviews federal contract protests. Reuters first reported the news on Tuesday. “Depending on the responses, the additional discussions may result in a new source selection decision,” said Air Force spokesman Justin Oakes. Lockheed welcomed the Air Force’s decision to address concerns raised about the competition for the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR). A spokesman for Northrop Grumman said: “We are pleased that the Air Force has indicated it will take corrective action to ensure a robust competition that should enable the Department to obtain the best solution for our warfighters. “We remain confident in Northrop Grumman’s ability to offer a capability that meets the Air Force’s critical mission requirements at an affordable cost,” Randy Belote, vice president of strategic communications, said in a statement. At Raytheon, Integrated Communications Manager Mike Nachshen said: “We were informed by the USAF of their decision, and are currently evaluating our options.

The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system on Thursday said it expected revenue to grow modestly in 2016, with further growth seen in subsequent years. Orders fell 5.4 percent to $7.11 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. But the company said it expected to finalize in the first quarter a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that was initially expected last year. U.S. arms makers have been hurt in recent years by the Pentagon’s plan to cut $1 trillion in spending over a decade as required by a 2011 law. Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras told Reuters he expected low single-digit revenue growth in 2016, with acquisitions, foreign orders and increasing U.S. demand seen accelerating gains in subsequent years. Foreign orders would account for about 30 to 35 percent of bookings and 30 percent of overall revenue in 2015, he said. Wajsgras, who will head Raytheon’s information systems business from March, said the company was investing in new technologies such as cybersecurity and electronic warfare to boost internal growth. More strategic acquisitions are also planned. Incoming CFO Toby O’Brien told analysts the company would continue to buy back shares and propose higher dividends. Last year, dividend payments rose 6 percent to $735 million, while share repurchases fell 30 percent to $750 million.

Chief Executive Officer Tom Kennedy said the company had worked closely with the Air Force to resolve issues with the GPS Operational Control System (OCX), noting that it was a complex and technologically advanced program. “We believe we have turned a corner on that program moving forward. We don’t see any impact in this year or in the out years relative to that program,” Kennedy told an earnings call with analysts. Pentagon arms buyer Frank Kendall last year ordered a “deep dive” review of the program after the contract’s value increased by over 80 percent to $1.6 billion.  The review has been delayed until early February due to schedule conflicts, his office said on Thursday. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon’s chief weapons tester, warned in a report delivered to Congress this month that delays in the delivery of the new ground control program posed risks to the Air Force’s ability to operate the GPS system of satellites.  The report cited a three-year delay in the operational evaluation of the new ground system to early 2019, and said the Air Force would not receive the first OCX control station until after six to eight of the GPS-III satellites have been built and launched. Matt Gilligan, the Raytheon vice president who runs the OCX program, said a separate, early OCX system would be delivered in time to support the launch, checkout and early-orbit control of the first GPS III satellite, and any payloads.

The Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog agency, is finalizing a report on the GPS program. The Air Force last summer restructured a $886 million contract awarded to Raytheon in February 2010 to develop the hardware and software needed to control GPS satellites after the program has run into technical challenges and cost increases. The changes raised the cost by 80.5 percent to $1.6 billion, and delayed its completion by two years to 2018.

328,RTN,UPDATE 1-U.S. to lead redesign of Raytheon missile defense 'kill vehicle',"(Adds Syring quotes, background on redesign effort, interceptor program paragraphs 3-8, 12) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Missile Defense Agency on Monday said it was close to finalizing a government-led effort to redesign a Raytheon Co “kill vehicle” used in the ground-based missile defense system that would involve Raytheon, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Vice Admiral James Syring, who heads the agency, said the government would own the new design, which it would use as the basis for a competition to produce the new vehicles in 2018. The government decided to spearhead the redesign effort instead of hiring a prime contractor so it could benefit from the positive aspects of each of the proposals submitted by the three rival companies, Syring told reporters at a budget briefing. “It’s our desire to get the best of all three, and that’s what we intend to do,” Syring said. The redesign effort is part of a broader effort led by Syring to improve the reliability of the existing fleet of ground-based interceptors after a series of test failures, quality problems and other issues in recent years. The agency conducted a successful intercept test in June for the first time since 2008. A non-intercept test was planned this year to evaluate alternative “divert thruster” to steer the interceptor, with the next intercept test slated a year later. Boeing runs the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system for the government, but the Missile Defense Agency will take over the effort to develop a new more reliable kill vehicle or warhead once its plan is approved. Syring said the Pentagon was “very close” to approving the plan. The agency requested $279 million as part of its overall $8.1 billion budget to continue design work on a new kill vehicle to improve reliability, availability and performance, and ensure the warheads were more producible. The agency’s 2016 budget request also includes funding for a detailed look at the reliability and design characteristics of the current fleet of interceptors. Syring said the agency also planned to award a contract for development of a new long-range discriminating radar before the end of fiscal 2015. Bids are due in March, with Raytheon, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp  expected to bid. Syring said there was “absolutely no presumed winner” in that competition, which will result in a contract valued at nearly $1 billion. The Air Force initially chose Raytheon to develop a separate long-range radar but is now reevaluating bids received from all three firms after Lockheed and Northrop protested the initial decision.

329,RTN,UPDATE 1-Poland may reconsider dropping Lockheed from missile tender - source,"(Adds Raytheon statement) By Wiktor Szary WARSAW, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Poland may review its decision to drop Lockheed Martin Corp’s MEADS system from its $5 billion missile defence tender, a senior source at the Polish Ministry of Defence said. The Polish programme is particularly significant for the defence sector given recent cuts to military spending. Poland plans to spend an estimated total of 130 billion zlotys ($36 billion) between 2013 and 2022 on modernising its armed forces. Last year, Poland excluded the Lockheed Martin-led consortium from the tender, short-listing two contenders: a consortium of European group MBDA and France’s Thales SA , and U.S. firm Raytheon Co, as potential suppliers. This decision may now be reviewed, the source said, if Germany decides to implement MEADS. The Polish defence ministry, MEADS and Raytheon did not immediately reply to requests for comment. MBDA declined to comment. “MEADS could still very well end up being on the table,” the source said. “We will consider allowing the MEADS system to take part in the tender, if Germany decides that it will be at the core of their missile defence.” “Formally, MEADS’ participation in the Polish tender is still possible,” the source added. Lockheed had no immediate comment on the news. Raytheon spokeswoman Kristin Hilf said the company had no indication that Poland had plans to change its approach since the June 2014 decision to short-list two bidders. Berlin is deciding whether to modernise its missile defences, based on Raytheon’s Patriot system, or implement MEADS. A German decision to commit to Lockheed Martin’s system would help the consortium meet Poland’s requirement that all proposed solutions have to be operational and in use by another NATO member state’s armed forces. “Poland wants its missile defence systems to be compatible with German ones, because Germany is our closest ally,” the source said. Last year, a senior German government source told Reuters the decision could come in 2015, once technical and legal questions have been clarified. According to a document seen by Reuters, the decision could be made this summer, but the Polish Ministry of Defence source said Poland thought Berlin could reach a decision as soon as Feb. 15. The United States, Italy and Germany spent about $3.4 billion over the past decade to develop MEADS as a successor to Patriot, but the United States decided in 2012 to withdraw due to budget cuts.

330,RTN,"Raytheon GPS ground program passes review, delays still possible","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A $1.6 billion ground control system being developed by Raytheon Co for Global Positioning System (GPS)satellites passed a Pentagon review, but will be monitored to ensure it stays on track, a senior Air Force official said on Friday. Major General Roger Teague, director of space programs for the Air Force acquisition chief, told reporters a “deep dive” review Thursday by chief arms buyer Frank Kendall went well, but program officials and the contractor got “tough marching orders” to stick to schedule and cost targets. Last week, Raytheon Chief Executive Officer Tom Kennedy told analysts that problems with the program had been resolved, and he did not expect an 80 percent cost increase to affect the company’s financial results. [ID:nL1N0V82EJ] Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon’s chief weapons tester, warned in a report to Congress last month that delays in delivery of the Operational Ground Control System (OCX) posed risks to the Air Force’s ability to operate GPS satellites. The report cited a three-year delay in the operational evaluation of the new ground system to early 2019, and said the Air Force would not receive the first OCX control station until after up to eight GPS III satellites were built and launched. Lockheed Martin Corp builds the GPS III satellites, but the program has faced delays due in part to technical challenges with a sensor built by Exelis Inc.  Air Force officials said Lockheed missed expectations on the program, but they had not decided whether to open the next set of GPS III satellites to competition. The Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center said the schedule for the OCX system was in synch with the needs of the satellite constellation, but further delays were possible. “There is a risk of further slips to OCX which could require a contingency operations capability” that would allow GPS III satellites to enter service before the ground station is delivered, said Tina Greer, spokeswoman for the center. She said the Air Force was studying options to keep the program on schedule, but gave no details.

331,RTN,"Raytheon GPS ground program passes review, delays still possible","WASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - A $1.6 billion ground control system being developed by Raytheon Co for Global Positioning System (GPS)satellites passed a Pentagon review, but will be monitored to ensure it stays on track, a senior Air Force official said on Friday. Major General Roger Teague, director of space programs for the Air Force acquisition chief, told reporters a “deep dive” review Thursday by chief arms buyer Frank Kendall went well, but program officials and the contractor got “tough marching orders” to stick to schedule and cost targets. Last week, Raytheon Chief Executive Officer Tom Kennedy told analysts that problems with the program had been resolved, and he did not expect an 80 percent cost increase to affect the company’s financial results. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon’s chief weapons tester, warned in a report to Congress last month that delays in delivery of the Operational Ground Control System (OCX) posed risks to the Air Force’s ability to operate GPS satellites. The report cited a three-year delay in the operational evaluation of the new ground system to early 2019, and said the Air Force would not receive the first OCX control station until after up to eight GPS III satellites were built and launched. Lockheed Martin Corp builds the GPS III satellites, but the program has faced delays due in part to technical challenges with a sensor built by Exelis Inc. Air Force officials said Lockheed missed expectations on the program, but they had not decided whether to open the next set of GPS III satellites to competition. The Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center said the schedule for the OCX system was in synch with the needs of the satellite constellation, but further delays were possible. “There is a risk of further slips to OCX which could require a contingency operations capability” that would allow GPS III satellites to enter service before the ground station is delivered, said Tina Greer, spokeswoman for the center.

334,RTN,UPDATE 3-Turkey eyes deal with China on missile defence despite NATO concern,"(Adds comments from Raytheon) By Tulay Karadeniz ANKARA, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Turkey’s defence minister said on Thursday the country does not plan to integrate a new missile defence system with NATO infrastructure and officials said a $3.4 billion deal with China was still under consideration. NATO member Turkey chose China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp as a preferred bidder in 2013, prompting U.S. and Western concern about security and the compatibility of the weaponry with NATO systems. Defence Minister Ismet Yilmaz, in a written response to a parliamentary question, indicated Ankara planned to go ahead with the Chinese system, saying the evaluation of bids had been completed and no new offers received. “The system in question will be integrated with the national system for Turkey’s defence and will be used without integrating with NATO,” Yilmaz said. However, other government officials later made clear that did not mean a final decision had yet been reached. “We are continuing discussions with all the bidders,” the undersecretariat for defence industries said in a statement. U.S. and NATO officials are unhappy with Turkey’s choice of the China Precision Machinery, which has been under U.S. sanctions for selling items to Iran, Syria or North Korea that are banned under U.S. laws to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Eurosam, which is owned by Franco-Italian missile maker MBDA and France’s Thales, came second in the tender. U.S.-listed Raytheon Co also put in an offer with its Patriot missile defense system, which is now operated by 13 countries around the world. Tim Glaeser, vice president with Raytheon’s Integrated Defense Systems business, said that Turkey had recently asked for additional clarifications about Raytheon’s proposal. “It’s our understanding that they are continuing to evaluate proposals from the French and the United States,” Glaeser said. “There’s renewed interest. We’re still in the game.”       (Additional reporting by Orhan Coskun and Humeyra Pamuk, and Andrea Shalal in Washington; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan, Angus MacSwan and Lisa Shumaker)",2192015,http://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-china-defence/update-3-turkey-eyes-deal-with-china-on-missile-defence-despite-nato-concern-idUSL5N0VT2KV20150219
335,RTN,U.S. approves export of new Raytheon sensor for Patriot missiles,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government has approved Raytheon Co to export a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) sensor based on gallium nitride semiconductor technology to countries that have Patriot missile defense systems, the company said Thursday. Raytheon has invested more than $150 million over the past 15 years in gallium nitride, or GaN, and it is part of a new Air and Missile Defense Radar that Raytheon is building for the U.S. Navy, as well as several Air Force programs. The export release of the new GaN-based AESA radar could boost Raytheon’s prospects in a big Polish missile defense competition since it would give the system the ability to see a 360-degree view of potential threats. Tim Glaeser, vice president at Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, said the new GaN-based sensor was “gamechanging” because it would help improve the reliability of the radar and lower its operating and maintenance costs. Raytheon is bidding against a French competitor in Poland. Glaeser said a decision by Poland or another foreign country to buy the new GaN-based AESA radar would help ensure that the U.S. Army could upgrade to the new capability in 2017. U.S. Army officials have said they plan to operate the Patriot system through 2048, but there is no funding in the Army budget for Patriot upgrades until 2017. Over $100 million in research and development investments, and a big order by the United Arab Emirates helped kick off the previous modernization of the Patriot weapons system. Glaeser said Raytheon had demonstrated the new GaN-based sensors at its test facility in New Hampshire in December for a U.S. government group and a high-level German delegation. The testing showed the sensors could help the Patriot system track ballistic missiles and other targets outside its current range. He said Germany is expected to make a decision in the late spring or early summer. Poland is also expected to make a decision about a new missile defense system this year. “We’ve been able to demonstrate a solution that’s low-cost, low-risk and very, very effective,” Glaeser said, noting the new sensor could be added onto existing Patriot fire units without having to bring the fire units back to the company’s facilities. He said the new technology would be available to each of the 13 countries already operating the Patriot system and other countries like Turkey that are looking at possible orders.

341,RTN,RPT-UPDATE 3-Israel tests U.S.-backed missile shield as Iran nuclear talks churn,"(Repeats to add byline; no change in text.) * “David’s Sling” due to be deployed next year * Israel sees threat from Iran-backed Hezbollah * Tests completed on deadline for Iran nuclear talks By Dan Williams and Andrea Shalal JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters) - A new Israeli air defense system being developed in partnership with the United States met all its objectives in a series of recent live interception tests, U.S. and Israeli officials said Wednesday, putting it on course for deployment by next year. The system, David’s Sling, shot down targets simulating longer-range missiles like Scuds that could be fired at Israel from Syria and by Lebanon’s Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas. Defense sources said the more recent tests took place last week and on Tuesday. The latter coincided with international negotiations on Iran’s disputed nuclear program that have drawn censure from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and in turn soured his relations with U.S. President Barack Obama. Moshe Yaalon, Israel’s defence minister, cited David’s Sling as a mark of the continued vigour of the Israeli-U.S. alliance. “We believe that next year it (David’s Sling) is going to be operational,” Yaalon told visiting U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, and added thanks for Washington’s funding. David’s Sling and its Stunner interceptor missiles successfully hit “threat representative targets” in the tests, said Rick Lehner, spokesman for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, which carried out the third series of tests of the system together with the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO). “This ... is a major milestone in the development of the David’s Sling weapon and provides confidence in future Israeli capabilities to defend against the developing threat,” he said. MDA Director Vice Admiral James Syring said Washington was pleased with the test results and vowed to continue U.S. assistance to Israel’s missile defense technology efforts. Known in Hebrew as Magic Wand, David’s Sling is being developed and manufactured jointly by Israel’s state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd and Raytheon Co, a top U.S. arms maker. Designed to shoot down rockets with ranges of 100 km to 200 km (63 miles to 125 miles), aircraft or low-flying cruise missiles, David’s Sling will fill the operational gap between Israel’s Iron Dome short-range rocket interceptor and the Arrow ballistic missile interceptor, both already in service. The latest successful tests are likely to strengthen support among U.S. lawmakers for Israel’s request for additional funds. Israeli officials last month asked Congress for an additional $317 million for David’s Sling and other Israeli missile defense programs, on top of $158 million already requested by the Obama administration in its fiscal 2016 budget. Fuelling the sense of urgency around David’s Sling development, Israeli media on Wednesday published military assessments that, in the next war with Hezbollah, the guerrillas could rain up to 1,500 rockets on Israel daily, killing hundreds of civilians. The latest tests were conducted under unusually strict secrecy, and had been rescheduled at least once. One date that had been considered, planners said, was March 3 — hours before Netanyahu, at Boehner’s invitation, gave a speech at the U.S. Congress that both praised Obama for supporting Israel’s security but rebuked him over the nuclear diplomacy with Iran. David’s Sling was first tested on Nov. 25, 2012, shooting down a simulated rocket. It experienced an early setback when a Nov. 18, 2013 trial failed because of a faulty sensor setting, a person who was present told Reuters. But all other interception tests have been successful, Israeli and U.S. officials said.

Raytheon also bought privately held Blackbird Technologies, which provides cybersecurity, surveillance and secure communications to spy agencies and special operations units, for $420 million in November last year. Headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, Raytheon focuses on the defense and security markets. It had sales in 2014 of $23 billion and has a market capitalization of $33 billion. Technology news website CRN first reported earlier on Friday that Raytheon had agreed to acquire Websense.   (Reporting by Mike Stone and Liana B.

347,RTN,Raytheon to buy cybersecurity firm Websense in $1.9 billion deal,"(Reuters) - U.S. arms maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) is buying network security provider Websense Inc from private equity firm Vista Equity Partners LLC in a $1.9 billion deal, the latest in the fast-growing cybersecurity market. Several companies, including Sony Corp (6758.T), Staples Inc SPLS.O, Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), have been targets of high-profile data thefts over the past two years. “We’re seeing an exponential increase in the number of attacks by ultra-sophisticated attackers,” Raytheon Chief Executive Thomas Kennedy told Reuters. “It is the combination of those two that is leading to an explosion in the cybersecurity area.” A cyber attack in mid-2014 at the U.S. Investigations Services, which performs background checks for U.S. government employees, compromised data of at least 25,000 workers, including some undercover investigators. The Websense deal will add more than 20,000 commercial customers to Raytheon’s portfolio of predominantly government clients.  “This acquisition highlights the massive investments being allocated toward this high-priority area of IT spending as enterprises of all shapes and sizes look to bulk up legacy security systems with next-generation technologies,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note. The global cybersecurity market is estimated to jump to about $156 billion in 2019 from $96 billion in 2014, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets. Bain Capital LLC agreed last month to buy network security company Blue Coat Systems Inc in deal that valued the company at about $2.4 billion, including debt. Raytheon, which is paying about $1.6 billion including debt for Websense, said it would combine its cybersecurity unit with the company. The deal is valued at $1.9 billion, net of cash. Vista will then invest about $335 million for a nearly 20 percent equity stake in the new company, Raytheon said on Monday. The new company, which will be headed by Websense CEO John McCormack, will be a separately reported business unit, Raytheon said. A board of directors will be formed for the new company and will include representatives of both Raytheon and Vista, the company said.

Airbus Helicopters’ Caracal EC725 has emerged as the front runner in a Polish tender for the supply of 70 multi-purpose helicopters, the newspaper said, without naming its sources. The two remaining bidders in the tender are Sikorsky Aircraft and AgustaWestland. President Bronislaw Komorowski, Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz, and Poland’s defence minister will meet to discuss the modernisation of the country’s armed forces at 1330 GMT today. A press briefing is due at 1400 GMT. Last year, Poland short-listed Raytheon and a consortium of France’s Thales and European group MBDA in its tender for the missile defence system, which is estimated to be worth about $5 billion. Poland said in March the decision on the provider of the missiles would be made within weeks. Poland, a NATO member since 1999, had accelerated the process to select a supplier for the missile system after Russia’s intervention in Ukraine prompted concern among NATO members in eastern Europe.

353,RTN,Raytheon 'really excited' over strength of international orders,"(Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Co’s (RTN.N) chief financial officer said he was “really excited” about the strength of international orders, after the maker of Tomahawk and Amraam missiles reported better-than-expected quarterly sales on Thursday. Raytheon’s bookings rose 4.1 percent in the first quarter, partly due to a $769 million order for its Patriot missiles from South Korea. Orders had fallen 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter. “We’re really excited about the orders and international strength that we’re seeing in the first quarter and shortly after,” Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien told Reuters. Raytheon booked a $2 billion order for its Patriot missiles from Saudi Arabia in the current quarter. The company has also been selected to sell the missiles to Poland, with bookings expected toward the back half of 2016, according to O’Brien. “We’re pleased to see Raytheon making progress in closing on defense export opportunities, with the Saudi win being particularly significant,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said. U.S. arms makers have increased sales to international markets and boosted their cybersecurity businesses to offset slowing sales to the military. O’Brien said international bookings were expected to make up 30-35 percent of total orders in 2015 and that the company was “probably a little bit more biased to the high end at this point.” International bookings accounted for 34 percent of total first-quarter orders. Raytheon said on Monday that it would buy network security company Websense Inc, adding more than 20,000 commercial customers to its government clients at a time when data breaches are surging. Larger rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), which is also increasing focus on its commercial cybersecurity business, reported a 6 percent fall in quarterly profit on Tuesday.

The decision marks a setback for Raytheon, which hopes to hold on to a contract that could be worth $1 billion, given the Air Force’s plan to buy 30 of the new systems in coming years. The radar is the primary transportable aerospace control and warning radar used by the Air Force and can be torn down and transported via trucks or C-130 transport planes. Raytheon spokesman Mike Nachshen said the company was disappointed by the decision and was considering its options. He gave no further details.  Raytheon has 60 days to appeal the May 11 decision by a U.S. Court of Federal Claims judge, according to two sources familiar with the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly.

Northrop and Lockheed both welcomed the news and said it opened the door to a possible new competition for the radar.

364,RTN,U.S. Air Force aims to complete radar bid re-evaluations in three months,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force expects to complete a reevaluation of bids to build a $1 billion long-range radar system in about three months, after Raytheon Co lost a legal bid to halt the review, the top Air Force acquisition official said Friday. Assistant Secretary William LaPlante told reporters that the Air Force would clarify the technology readiness level required for one aspect of the new radar and ask all three bidders to resubmit their proposals. “It’s really not that complicated,” LaPlante said after a speech hosted by the Air Force Association. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims on Monday dismissed a lawsuit filed by Raytheon in January aimed at halting a fresh look at the bids submitted by its losing rivals Northrop Grumman Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp. Northrop and Lockheed had protested the Air Force’s October contract award to Raytheon to develop and build 30 Three Dimension Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) systems to replace the Air Force’s current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s. The primary transportable aerospace control and warning radar used by the Air Force, the existing system can be torn down and transported via trucks or C-130 transport planes. The next generation radar now under consideration must be able to perform a similar function. Raytheon, which has 60 days to appeal the court’s decision, has said it is considering its options. LaPlante said the Air Force decided to take corrective action earlier this year rather than wait for a ruling from the Government Accountability Office to address GAO’s concerns about the technology readiness requirements in the original terms of the competition. He defended the Air Force’s overall record on acquisitions, and said officials at Hanscom Air Force Base, who handled the 3DELRR competition, had no contract protests sustained in the past 10 years.  LaPlante said the GAO did not formally sustain the 3DELRR protests since the Air Force opted to take corrective action. GAO officials say a growing number of government agencies are opting for contract reviews in recent years rather than waiting for the GAO, a congressional agency, to rule on protests. LaPlante said 140 protests were lodged last year against over 100,000 contracts awarded by the Air Force, and only two were upheld, or sustained by the GAO. The Air Force took corrective action on 20 of the cases, he said.

The U.S. Court of Federal Claims on Monday dismissed a lawsuit filed by Raytheon in January aimed at halting a fresh look at the bids submitted by its losing rivals Northrop Grumman Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp. Northrop and Lockheed had protested the Air Force’s October contract award to Raytheon to develop and build 30 Three Dimension Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) systems to replace the Air Force’s current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s. The primary transportable aerospace control and warning radar used by the Air Force, the existing system can be torn down and transported via trucks or C-130 transport planes. The next generation radar now under consideration must be able to perform a similar function. Raytheon, which has 60 days to appeal the court’s decision, has said it is considering its options. LaPlante said the Air Force decided to take corrective action earlier this year rather than wait for a ruling from the Government Accountability Office to address GAO’s concerns about the technology readiness requirements in the original terms of the competition. He defended the Air Force’s overall record on acquisitions, and said officials at Hanscom Air Force Base, who handled the 3DELRR competition, had no contract protests sustained in the past 10 years. LaPlante said the GAO did not formally sustain the 3DELRR protests since the Air Force opted to take corrective action. GAO officials say a growing number of government agencies are opting for contract reviews in recent years rather than waiting for the GAO, a congressional agency, to rule on protests. LaPlante said 140 protests were lodged last year against over 100,000 contracts awarded by the Air Force, and only two were upheld, or sustained by the GAO. The Air Force took corrective action on 20 of the cases, he said.

366,RTN,"RPT-Missile shield for Gulf to take years, and heavy U.S. commitment","(Repeats story with no change to text) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, May 15 (Reuters) - A U.S.-supplied missile shield to protect Gulf nations against Iranian attacks will take years to complete, requiring a step-up in regional trust, more U.S. sales of sensitive weapons, and intensive U.S. training to avoid mishaps in the volatile region. A renewed joint commitment to build the regional defense system was one of the few firm outcomes of Thursday’s Camp David summit between President Barack Obama and Gulf allies, which were seeking fresh U.S. defense pledges ahead of a possible nuclear deal they fear will empower arch-rival Iran. Past efforts have stalled due to tension and mistrust within the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) but U.S. and Gulf officials say the time is now ripe to push ahead as Arab nations mount more joint military missions. A joint statement following the summit said that the GCC states were committed to developing a ballistic missile defense capability, including an early warning system, with U.S. technical help. Washington pledged to fast-track arms transfers to the GCC states and to send a team to the region in the coming weeks to discuss the details. The Gulf nations fear that the sanctions relief that would accompany a nuclear deal with Tehran due by June 30 could revive Iran’s economy and enable it to acquire more accurate and reliable missiles. An integrated defense system would allow Gulf countries to better repel an Iranian attack, stitching together their radars and interceptors to counter a range of different missiles. The system would use U.S. early-warning satellites and a mix of U.S. and Gulf radars to detect the launch of an enemy missile and fire a ground- or sea-based missile to destroy it far above the earth. Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp would be key contenders to build a central command-and-control system for the shield since they already do similar work for the U.S. military and key allies. The biggest challenge to making the shield work would be securing a broad agreement on the rules for dealing with any threats, said Anthony Cordesman, a senior analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “You have to work out the entire engagement structure before the first missile is ever launched,” Cordesman said. Getting to that point will require unprecedented agreements between the U.S. military and the GCC, and among the often rancorous Gulf allies, to share sensitive data to avoid the risk of a friendly aircraft being shot down by mistake, experts said. Intensive U.S.-led training would also be vital to minimize the risk of mishaps, U.S. officials say. The U.S. military already has 10 Patriot missile batteries to defend against short-range ballistic missiles in the Gulf region and Jordan, as well as a powerful AN-TPY-2 radar system to scan for missile launches, according to U.S. officials. The Gulf countries are upgrading their existing Raytheon Patriot systems to incorporate new PAC-3 missiles built by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp, and are starting to buy wider-area and longer-range systems like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), built by Lockheed. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in Washington this week that Gulf countries would need new ground-based networks and computer terminals to manage those systems. He said the Gulf countries also wanted longer-range options like the Raytheon SM-3 missile, which has not yet been released for export to the region. Washington has balked at selling a land-based Aegis combat system to deal with missile threats and any associated SM-3 missiles to Gulf countries, largely because such a system would be best suited to dealing with threats outside the earth’s atmosphere that are beyond Iran’s capability, Cordesman said. Washington’s decision in December to allow U.S. arms sales to the GCC as an organization - similar to its arrangement with NATO - helped pave the way for progress on integrating missile defense and maritime security systems. “That’s a huge step in the right direction,” said a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Cordesman said Raytheon’s new SM-6 missile could prove useful to address Gulf concerns since it could address threats inside the earth’s atmosphere as well as outside. U.S. officials had no immediate comment on whether the Gulf countries had made any formal request for the SM-6 system. Al-Jubeir cautioned against expecting rapid progress on missile defense integration. “Those are complicated systems that take time to acquire and then take time to put in place,” he said. “You can’t buy these things off the shelf and take them home the day you buy them ...

369,RTN,CORRECTED-(OFFICIAL) UPDATE 2-U.S. Air Force continuing review of radar bid despite Raytheon appeal,"(U.S. Air Force corrects that it is continuing to review bids) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force on Tuesday said it was continuing to re-evaluate bids for a new $1 billion long-range radar contract after Raytheon Co appealed a decision by a federal claims court that cleared the way for the review. “Raytheon has filed two separate motions with the Court of Federal Claims ... We are continuing to move forward with our overall corrective action plan while we wait for the court to rule on the motions,” said Justin Oakes, a spokesman for Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts.

Rick Lehner, spokesman for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, said the test conducted on Saturday from the Point Mugu Sea Range off the coast of California was a success.  The SM-3 IIA is a 21-inch variant of an earlier SM-3 missile, which works with the U.S. Aegis combat system built by Lockheed Martin Corp to destroy incoming ballistic missile threats in space. Riki Ellison, who heads the non-profit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said the two countries would spend about $1 billion each to design, test and eventually produce the new missiles, a model for joint weapons development programs. “It is the U.S. Department of Defense’s best case of equal funding and engineering shared with an allied country to develop and ... field a new weapon system to better enhance the national security of both nations,” Ellison said in a statement. Raytheon said the new SM-3 IIA missile had bigger rocket motors and a more capable kill vehicle that would allow the missile to engage threats sooner and protect larger regions from short- to intermediate-range ballistic missile threats. Saturday’s test evaluated the performance of the missile’s nosecone, steering control, and the separation of its booster, and second and third stages. No intercept was planned, and no target missile was launched, said U.S. and company officials. “The success of this test keeps the program on track for a 2018 deployment at sea and ashore,” said Taylor Lawrence, president of Raytheon’s missile systems business.

376,RTN,"UPDATE 1-Germany to buy MEADS defense system from MBDA, Lockheed","(Adds comments from German official, Raytheon, byline) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, June 9 (Reuters) - Germany said on Tuesday it will buy the MEADS air and missile defense system from Europe’s MBDA and Lockheed Martin Corp instead of an updated Patriot system offered by Raytheon Co, but said the companies would have to meet demanding performance milestones to retain the contract. Germany funded a quarter of the $4 billion invested by it, the United States and Italy to develop the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) as a successor to the Patriot air defense system fielded in the 1980s. Germany is the first country to choose the MEADS system, a decision worth up to $4.5 billion to the system’s manufacturers, and industry officials say its decision could trigger a similar order from Italy and possibly the Netherlands. German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen announced the decision and said MEADS would make it possible to put a protective shield around entire cities and military camps. Von der Leyen said Germany plans to keep the huge new procurement program on track by setting up specific controls and  milestones. If the companies fail to meet those targets, Germany could still cancel the contract and give Patriot maker Raytheon another chance at the deal, she said. German opposition parties criticized the decision to proceed with the MEADs program, saying there were significant technical, financial and strategic concerns about the system. Lockheed and MBDA, a consortium that includes Italy’s Finmeccanica SpA, Airbus Group and Britain’s BAE Systems Plc, hailed the German decision. MBDA said MEADS would give the German military a powerful state-of-the-art system that can handle current and future threats, and said it recognized its responsibility in building a solid basis for the successful introduction of the system. Lockheed, the largest U.S. weapons maker, said in a statement that it was fully committed to the success of Germany’s Taktisches Luftverteidigungssystem (TVLS) with MBDA. It said the system was designed to significantly reduce operation and support costs by covering a larger area with less manpower and equipment, and less demand on airlift. Raytheon said in a statement that it had not been formally notified of any decision by the German government, and would continue to support its “consideration of alternatives prior to a final contract award”. The United States, citing budget cuts, opted out of the system in 2012. Poland recently chose Raytheon’s updated Patriot system instead of MEADS.

Germany paid for a quarter of the $4 billion invested by Germany, the United States and Italy to develop the next-generation Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) as a successor to the Patriot air defense systems first fielded in the 1980s. Germany is the first country to choose the MEADS system, and industry officials say its decision could trigger a similar order from Italy and possibly the Netherlands. A German government source late on Monday confirmed German and U.S. media reports about the decision, which could be worth up to $4.5 billion for the companies. MBDA, a consortium that includes Italy’s Finmeccanica SpA, Airbus Group and Britain’s BAE Systems Plc, said MEADS would give the German military a powerful state-of-the-art system that can handle current and future threats. Lockheed, the largest U.S. weapons maker, said in a statement that it was fully committed to the success of Germany’s Taktisches Luftverteidigungssystem (TVLS) with MBDA. It said the system was designed to significantly reduce operation and support costs by covering a larger area with less manpower and equipment, and less demand on airlift. The United States, citing budget cuts, opted out of the system in 2012. Poland recently chose Raytheon’s Patriot system instead of MEADS.

Lockheed said the team aimed to develop a low-risk, affordable replacement for the E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), a ground surveillance, battle management, and command and control aircraft that was built by Northrop Grumman Corp. Northrop and Boeing Co have also said they plan to compete for the contract when the Air Force launches a competition in the coming years. The head of Lockheed’s aeronautics division, Orlando Carvalho, told Reuters the project would be led by Lockheed’s Skunkworks research and development shop and would feature an open architecture that would allow the government to own the technical baseline for future upgrades. Lockheed will serve as the main integrator for the project, while Raytheon will bring its expertise with various surveillance sensors, mission systems integration, and JSTARS communications. Bombardier will provide its ultra-long-range Global business jet, which Lockheed said is less expensive to operate than modern airliners and requires less refueling. “We plan to bring all this technology and expertise together to offer what we believe will be a very competitive solution,” Carvalho said. Lockheed said the teaming agreement matched the U.S. government’s desire for strong industry partnerships and would give the Air Force superior capabilities. Carvalho said it was the first time that Lockheed had teamed up to pursue a major program with Bombardier. The Air Force already uses the Bombardier Global as the basis for its  Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, or BACN program.

387,RTN,"Raytheon beats estimates with higher second-quarter earnings, revenues","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N) on Thursday said strong international demand for its weapons systems fueled higher-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenues, prompting the company to raise its 2015 revenue target and sending its shares sharply higher. Raytheon, maker of the Patriot missile system, reported net earnings of $504 million from continuing operations, or $1.65 per share, up from $499 million and $1.59 per share a year earlier. Revenues rose 3 percent to $5.8 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had forecast earnings of $488 million or $1.62 per share and revenues of $5.48 billion. The company said its $1.9 billion acquisition of Websense, a cybersecurity firm, was going better than expected and the unit should be accretive to earnings in two to three years, instead of three to four years as initially expected. Chief Executive Tom Kennedy told analysts the company saw strong demand for cybersecurity given continuing attacks on private and federal computer networks, as well as growing international demand for the company’s weapons systems. He said international orders accounted for a record 44 percent of the company’s backlog at the end of the second quarter, something he called a “monumental” achievement. That compared to 38 percent a year earlier. Kennedy said he was optimistic that U.S. lawmakers would agree to some measure to ease mandatory budget caps slated to resume in fiscal 2016, which could help domestic revenues return to growth late next year or early in 2017. “Both on the domestic and international (sides), we see a significant pipeline that will take us well beyond 2020,” he said on a quarterly earnings call. Raytheon shares were trading $7.54, or 7.8 percent higher, at $104.53 around mid-morning on the New York Stock Exchange. Raytheon said it now expected $22.7 billion to $23.2 billion in revenues for the full year, up from its earlier forecast of $22.3 billion to $22.8 billion.  The company lowered its outlook for earnings per share to a range of $6.47 to $6.62, from $6.67 to $6.82, to reflect about $0.25 in dilutive effect from the Websense acquisition, but the impact was about half of what the company initially projected. Excluding the acquisition, the company now expected earnings per share to rise about $0.05, Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien told Reuters. The company said it had approved $250 million in additional share repurchases for the year, which would bring the total for the year to around $1 billion, $250 million more than in 2014. O’Brien said the company remained upbeat about the Websense acquisition despite Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) announcement this week that it may sell or spin off its commercial cyber unit and other services businesses. Acquiring the firm gave Raytheon the scale it needed to play a significant role in the growing commercial market, he said.

The test was one of four successful tests completed last week by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, U.S. Pacific Command and the crew of the USS John Paul Jones, a Navy destroyer, which showed the ability of SM-6 and SM-2 missiles to destroy enemy cruise and ballistic missiles. “This important test campaign not only demonstrated an additional terminal defense layer of the (Ballistic Missile Defense System), it also proved the robustness of the multi-use SM-6 missile on board a Navy destroyer,” Missile Defense Agency Director Vice Admiral James Syring said in a statement. Syring said the tests underscored the versatility of the latest version of the Aegis combat system built by Lockheed Martin Corp for use on Navy destroyers. The SM-6 missile intercepted a ballistic missile target in its final seconds of flight on July 28, followed by three more  tests over the next days. MDA fired two more SM-6 missiles in anti-air warfare roles to engage cruise missile targets and then an SM-2 Block IV missile against a ballistic missile threat.  All the tests occurred at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii.

396,RTN,Lockheed wins deal worth up to $428 mln for U.S. Navy combat systems,"WASHINGTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp  beat out Raytheon Co to win a contract worth up to $428 million to continue modernizing Aegis combat systems on U.S. Navy ships, the Pentagon announced on Friday. The U.S. Department of Defense said the Navy awarded Lockheed an initial contract worth $26.5 million, which includes options that would bring the total value to $428 million. Lockheed said the 10-year contract expands its 40-year legacy integrating the Aegis combat system on Navy warships. The contract calls for Lockheed to install the hardware and software needed for the combat system on board new Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and to modernize existing destroyers and cruisers to operate the latest version of Aegis, Baseline 9. The system allows ships to defend simultaneously against airborne threats, such as aircraft or cruise missiles, while also targeting and intercepting ballistic missiles, Lockheed said. “When a ship goes into harm’s way, the combat system must work 100 percent of the time - there is no margin of error,” said Chris Minster, a senior program manager with Lockheed.

399,RTN,UPDATE 1-U.S. approves possible sale of General Atomics drones to Spain,"(Adds details on possible sale, use of drones) WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to Spain of four MQ-9 Reaper unmanned planes built by privately-held General Atomics, a deal valued at about $243 million, the Pentagon told U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday. The deal would include four MQ-9 Block 5 drones, 20 embedded global positioning systems, two mobile ground control stations, five targeting systems and five radars, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said in a statement. Lawmakers have 15 days to block the sale, although such action is rare since deals are usually vetted carefully before being formally notified to Congress. DSCA, which facilitates foreign arms sales, said the deal would enhance the Spanish military’s ability to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance in support of NATO missions, and as part of other coalition efforts. It would also allow Spain to work better together with other MQ-9 operators including the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The agency said the Spanish Air Force would use the MQ-9s for homeland security, peacekeeping, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations. Other contractors on the deal would include Raytheon Co  and L-3 Communications Holdings Inc, the agency said.

400,RTN,"Aerospace startups, investors matched using reality TV show format","WASHINGTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The business development company Starburst Accelerator, which calls itself the world’s largest incubator for aerospace startups, said on Monday it has signed agreements with Boeing Co, Raytheon Co and other big companies looking for new technologies. Starburst will expose the big aerospace companies to its stable of fledgling aerospace companies with products ranging from drones to aircraft seats to complex aviation software. It says many of its start-ups have technology that could radically alter the way aircraft are now built and maintained. It opened its new California office on Oct. 2 with an event similar to the “Shark Tank” television program, an ABC TV reality show in which entrepreneurs seek investments from a panel of potential investors, known as “sharks.” The goal is to match aerospace entrepreneurs with venture capitalists and larger companies that may invest in them or buy their products. The event gave 29 startups a chance to seek funding from 100 industry executives, venture capitalists and research institutes, said Starburst partner Van Espahbodi, who helped found the company in Paris three years ago. The California event was hosted by Boeing at its El Segundo office, while Raytheon Co is slated to host the next event on Dec. 4, also in El Segundo, Espahbodi, a former congressional staff member and Raytheon executive, told Reuters. Espahbodi said Starburst is also working with research centers in other cities, including Wichita, Kansas, Chicago, and Boston to help startups navigate the “nebulous” world of procurement. Starburst vets the startups carefully to ensure they have moved beyond ideas to solid intellectual property. Boeing, Panasonic Aviation, Booz Allen Hamilton and other big companies then pay a fee of $100,000 a year for access to the events and one-on-one work with the startup hunters. The companies and investors then decide which startups to help fund. Starburst is focused on commercial aerospace, but plans to move into weapons-related markets as well, particularly given the Pentagon’s recent increased focus on innovation and developing ties to Silicon Valley, Espahbodi said. He is due to meet with officials from the White House and Federal Aviation Administration in Washington this week to describe the program. One firm that stood out at the Oct. 2 event was Enduralock, a company founded by a spinal surgeon who has patented a new vibration-resistant fastener technology for use on aircraft, Espahbodi said. Another more “audacious” startup, he said, was Natilus, which is developing large, autonomous drones that can deliver cargo, and can fly as low as 80 feet or as high as 40,000 feet. Natilus says the drones could cut the cost of shipping freight by 75 percent. Starburst plans to open another office in Singapore next year, company officials said.

401,RTN,Raytheon posts sharp drop in profit; lifts 2015 revenue forecast,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N), maker of the Patriot missile system, on Thursday reported sharply lower net earnings and bookings in the third quarter, but said revenues for the full year would be higher than expected, with further growth seen in 2016. The company’s upbeat outlook drove shares over 4 percent higher to $117.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien said the drop in quarterly earnings was due to the mix of products, internal investments in new technologies, and costs related to the company’s $1.9 billion Websense acquisition in May.  Quarterly earnings still exceeded Raytheon’s expectations, he said, and business segment operating margins remained strong despite a drop to 12.3 percent, excluding adjustments for the Websense acquisition, from 13.5 percent a year earlier. Bookings, which fell 9.6 percent in the quarter, were seen reaching $25.5 billion in 2015, plus or minus $500 million, topping the company’s previous outlook by about $1 billion. Revenues were now seen in a range of $23 billion to $23.3 billion in 2015, up from an earlier range of $22.7 billion to $23.2 billion. The company lefts its full-year forecast for earnings per share unchanged at $6.47 to $6.62. O’Brien said sales should grow 3 percent to 4 percent in 2016, driven by new development awards, while segment margins were likely to be “flat to up.” O’Brien said international sales accounted for a record 32 percent of total quarterly sales, with the full year percentage expected to be around 30 percent. He said Poland remained in talks with the U.S. government about a $5 billion Patriot missile system order, despite reports that the expected winner of Poland’s Oct. 25 parliamentary election could rethink that arms sale and others. A formal letter of request for the Raytheon system was expected next year, with a contract award likely in 2017, he said. Another big deal expected this year, a multi-billion dollar order by Qatar for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system was likely to slip until 2016, or perhaps 2017, he said. Lockheed builds THAAD, while Raytheon supplies its main radar. But a separate $1 billion Qatari order for an early warning radar system should be finalized in 2016, officials said. Raytheon reported quarterly net earnings of $448 million from continuing operations, a drop of 13 percent from $515 million a year earlier, while earnings per share fell nearly 11 percent to $1.47 from $1.65 a year earlier.  Revenues rose 5.6 percent to $5.78 billion from $5.47 billion, buoyed by Patriot and TOW anti-tank missile sales. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had forecast earnings of $435 million or $1.43 per share and revenues of $5.76 billion. O’Brien said Raytheon repurchased $250 million in shares in the quarter, and was on track to complete $1 billion in buybacks by year-end.

Raytheon in May appealed a decision in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that had cleared the way for the review. Raytheon first won the contract in October, but the matter was quickly protested by both losing bidders, prompting the Air Force to take a fresh look at the bids. In her decision, Judge Margaret Sweeney said the Air Force’s decision to reopen the competition was justified since the agency had violated rules on equal communications with bidders about whether they could recover internal research and development spending (IR&D;) linked to the bid. The Air Force initially told bidders such costs were not allowable, but later told Raytheon it could recover certain IR&D; costs, which allowed it to lower its pricing. It did not relay that change in approach to Northrop. “That disparity in information favored Raytheon over Northrop,” said the decision, which was dated Friday and posted on the court’s website on Monday. The Air Force said the court’s decision would allow it to “continue source selection and take corrective action.” Justin Oakes, spokesman for Hanscomb Air Force Base in Massachusetts, which is overseeing the process, declined comment on when a new contract award could be announced. The companies submitted final program revisions at the beginning of October.

419,RTN,"Raytheon partners with Saudi electronics company, eyes civil orders","DUBAI (Reuters) - Raytheon Company (RTN.N) plans to partner with a Saudi electronics firm to grow its presence in the Gulf, part of a push to expand global commercial sales, its international chief executive said this week. Raytheon, one of the largest U.S. arms makers, announced an agreement at the Dubai Airshow with Riyadh-based Advanced Electronics Co (AEC) to explore collaboration on weapon systems, integrated sensors, civil aviation and cybersecurity. “We see significant growth in the international marketplace, and the GCC figures prominently in that growth plan,” John Harris, the chief executive of Raytheon International, told Reuters at the air show on Wednesday, referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council group of countries. The Gulf region is the largest market driver in the arms industry, buying billions of dollars of military equipment each year. Saudi Arabia spent $7.7 billion in 2014, more than double any of its neighbors, according to research firm IHS. Saudi Arabia uses the Raytheon Patriot missile and air defense system, and was recently cleared to receive $5.4 billion in new PAC-3 missiles built by Lockheed. Raytheon and AEC already work together on manufacturing of components for the kingdom’s program to buy F-15 fighter jets from Boeing Co (BA.N). The agreement reflects Raytheon’s new focus on building partnerships with local firms in targeted markets, and expanding into related commercial fields, instead of focusing on single weapons programs as it has in the past. “Our play (in Saudi Arabia) is not only in the defense sector, but also in the commercial marketplace,” said Harris, citing cybersecurity and air traffic control as prospective growth areas for international sales. Harris said Raytheon had nine customers in Saudi Arabia, but gave no details on its sales in the kingdom. He said the GCC figured prominently in Raytheon’s plan to keep expanding foreign sales, which already account for 30 percent of total sales. Raytheon has also invested heavily in building its cyber capacity in recent years, making several acquisitions in the cyber market over the past decade, said Harris. Earlier this year, Raytheon bought network security provider Websense in a deal worth $1.9 billion, adding more than 20,000 commercial customers to its predominantly government clients to address private sector data breaches. AEC, which splits its business evenly between commercial and military work, has also moved into the cybersecurity market in recent years, spokesman Khalid Turki said.  AEC has clients in the defense, telecommunications and industrial sectors, including state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco, which was hit by a crippling cyber attack in 2012 that damaged some 30,000 computers. Harris declined to comment on whether Raytheon’s partnership with AEC might include projects at Aramco.

421,RTN,UPDATE 2-Pentagon eyes alternatives for Raytheon satellite control system,"(Adds Raytheon statement) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The Pentagon’s chief arms buyer on Wednesday said he plans another “deep dive” review on Friday of a troubled Raytheon Co program to develop ground controls for a new generation of GPS satellites, and could decide to open part of the program to a new competition. Frank Kendall, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, told an industry conference he is “very worried” about the software-intensive Raytheon program, which has seen costs rise sharply due to what he called problems with contractor performance and cyber security requirements. The system is critical to the Air Force’s ability to operate GPS, or global positioning system, satellites which help the military target weapons strikes, provide critical timing information and also provide critical services for commercial industry. After the speech, Kendall told reporters that Raytheon was nearing completion on some of the work, but said the department was looking at various alternatives, including launching a new competition, to complete the bulk of the work on the program. Kendall carried out a similar review of Raytheon’s next-generation GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, earlier this year after its cost soared to $1.6 billion, up 80.5 percent from an initial contract value, and the program’s completion was delayed by two years to 2018. The U.S. Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center awarded Raytheon a contract in February 2010 to develop the hardware and software needed to control U.S. GPS satellites and ensure the security of their signals, but the program has run into technical challenges and seen cost increases. Kendall said the program was still experiencing problems but gave no details. The Air Force’s former top acquisition official, William LaPlante, told reporters before leaving office that the program was in “bad” shape, but did not elaborate. Matt Gilligan, Raytheon’s vice president for navigation and environmental solutions, said the program was now on “a strong foundation” after completion of a number of critical corrective actions implemented since late 2013. “As a result, this vitally important program is now well positioned for predictable performance and strong execution going forward,” Gilligan said in a statement. “Raytheon firmly believes that GPS OCX is the best path forward to meet the country’s needs for a completely capable and cyber hardened ground control system and the nation’s full modernization requirements without compromise.” The OCX system passed the Pentagon’s review last February, but Air Force officials said it would be monitored closely to ensure it stuck to cost and schedule targets. The Pentagon’s chief weapons tester warned last January that an operational evaluation of the new ground system would be delayed to early 2019, and said the Air Force would not receive the first control station until after up to eight GPS III satellites were built and launched. Lockheed Martin Corp’s program to build the GPS III satellites is back on track after delays involving a sensor built by Exelis Inc, which is now owned by Harris Corp.

422,RTN,Raytheon's GPS control system is 'a disaster': U.S. Air Force general,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force’s top space official on Tuesday slammed a new ground control system for GPS satellites being built by Raytheon Co as “a disaster” and said the Pentagon planned “significant” changes with the company to address the issues. General John Hyten, commander of Air Force Space Command, spoke after attending a session on the program last Friday led by the Pentagon’s chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall. Air Force spokeswoman Captain Annmarie Annicelli said the  Air Force would develop new cost estimates for the troubled GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, to reflect an additional two-year delay in completing its development. Air Force officials earlier this year said the program had an 80.5 percent cost increase, to $1.6 billion, and a two-year delay due to increased cyber security requirements and issues with the contractor’s performance. Hyten, speaking with reporters after an event, said Raytheon had completed an initial system called Block 0 to launch and fly the satellites, but more sophisticated software was needed to take full advantage of all the GPS signals over the longer term. He said the Air Force initially underestimated the challenge of securing the system from cyber attacks and later had to revise its approach. But he said Raytheon also “did a really bad job” of systems engineering before it began developing software code. “The OCX program is a disaster, just a disaster, and it’s embarrassing to have to stand in front of people and try to defend it, so I won’t,” Hyten told the event. “When you start down a path and you basically can’t deliver and you keep pushing the system out to the right, and you keep pouring money at it, and the contractor does not deliver, you’re in a tough spot.” Matt Gilligan, Raytheon’s vice president for navigation and environmental solutions, said the company was focused on continued development of the system. “We are fully committed to delivering, without compromise, the modernized GPS ground controls envisioned and required by the Air Force,” Gilligan said in a statement to Reuters. Kendall last week told reporters the department was looking at a range of options for the program, including opening part of the work to a new competition. Neither the Pentagon nor the Air Force had any immediate comment on Tuesday on possible further steps to open part of the work to competition.

423,RTN,U.S.-Japan funded Raytheon SM-3 missile aces second test: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Japan on Tuesday conducted a second successful test of Raytheon Co’s new Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missile that is being jointly developed by the two countries, according to two sources familiar with the test. During the test off the coast of Southern California near Malibu, the missile opened its new sensor seeker in space for the first time and used new altitude control rockets to target a star, said one of the sources, who was not authorized to speak publicly.  No intercept was planned for this test and no target missile was launched, but several intercept tests will following in coming years, said the source. The United States spent just over $2 billion on the SM-3 IIA weapons program, while Japan contributed about $1 billion, according to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.  The new missile is a 21-inch variant of an earlier SM-3 missile and works with the U.S. Aegis combat system built by Lockheed Martin Corp to destroy incoming ballistic missile threats in space. Tuesday’s test marked another milestone toward deployment of the missile on U.S. Aegis destroyers and Japan’s Kongo ships in coming years, as well as the U.S. Aegis Ashore site in Poland in 2018. The test also validated the new sensor seeker developed for the redesigned kill vehicle, or warhead, that will eventually replace the ones now used on the U.S. fleet of ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California that are part of the U.S. homeland missile defense system, the sources said. Neither Raytheon nor the U.S. Missile Defense Agency had any immediate comment. Raytheon’s new SM-3 IIA missile has bigger rocket motors and a more capable kill vehicle that would allow the missile to engage threats sooner and protect larger regions from short- to intermediate-range ballistic missile threats. On Tuesday, the Pentagon announced that Raytheon was awarded a contract for more than $543 million for 17 SM-3 IIA missiles.

437,RTN,Exclusive: U.S. Air Force to work on alternative GPS ground system,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force will continue work on an alternative ground control program and explore outside options to hedge against further cost spikes and delays on Raytheon Co’s (RTN.N) troubled ground control system for next-generation GPS satellites, according to an Air Force document seen by Reuters. The Air Force on Tuesday said a “deep dive” review led by the Pentagon’s chief arms buyer last week resulted in a further two-year delay in completion of the Raytheon program and potential cost increases, but gave no additional details. The delays and cost increases are the latest troubles facing a program slammed as “a disaster” on Tuesday by General John Hyten, commander of Air Force Space Command.  Raytheon won a contract worth up to $1.5 billion in 2010 to develop the GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, to operate the next generation GPS 3 satellites being built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). By December 2014, the program’s projected cost had soared to $3.6 billion, including inflation, due to increased cyber security requirements and poor contractor performance, according to Air Force and Pentagon officials. Earlier this month, Air Force officials estimated that the program could require an additional 47-month delay that could send its total cost, including inflation, as high as $5.6 billion, according to a source familiar with the issue.  However, officials agreed at Friday’s deep-dive review to stretch the program only for 24 months, which should result in a smaller cost increase, said the source, who expressed continued skepticism despite the belief of some Air Force officials that the program was now beyond the worst of its problems. “This program is a big mess and there aren’t any good options in terms of how to fix it,” said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly.  Starting from scratch with a new contractor would take too long, the source added, but the current plan meant that the Air Force would be unable to test or use the full capabilities of its new GPS 3 satellites for years after they were launched. Needed cyber security protections would also be delayed. At Friday’s review, officials agreed to expand oversight of the program; institute quarterly reviews by the Pentagon’s top acquisition official, Frank Kendall, and Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy; and expedite contingency plans meant to ensure the older GPS ground control system could be used to operate the new GPS 3 satellites until the new system was done. The Air Force also agreed to continue work on an alternative ground control system and explore options outside the OCX program, including adding military code functions to other systems, to hedge against further cost growth and delays.  Air Force officials had no immediate comment on the additional, previously unreported, plans for the program, or the cost estimates prepared earlier this month. Raytheon declined to comment. The company is now expected to complete work on the OCX system by July 2022, two years later than expected in a revamped baseline established in October, the document showed. The longer 47-month delay would have increased the program’s cost by over 30 percent from its current baseline, or 50 percent above the initial plan, triggering a live-or-die review of the program required under the Nunn-McCurdy law, the document said. It said it was uncertain if the shorter delay would also trigger such a review.

439,RTN,Lockheed wins $1.09 billion contract for Patriot PAC-3 missiles,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) has won a U.S. Army contract worth $1.09 billion to build PAC-3 missiles for the U.S. Army, South Korea, Qatar and Saudi Arabia for use in Raytheon Co’s (RTN.N) Patriot missile defense system, the Pentagon said Monday. The contract runs through June 30, 2019, the U.S. Defense Department said in its daily digest of major arms contracts. Lockheed, the Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier, said the contract includes Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles for the U.S. Army, as well as PAC-3 missiles for the other countries. Lockheed won a similar contract valued at $1.5 billion in July. The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced the possible sale of up to $1.75 billion in PAC-3 missiles and associated equipment to Saudi Arabia last October, followed by another deal valued at up to $5.4 billion for more missiles in July. The U.S. government approved PAC-3 missile sales worth up to $1.41 billion with South Korea in November 2014, and the sale to Qatar of PAC-3 missiles in November 2012. Other countries that have ordered the Lockheed missile include the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Taiwan and Kuwait. Scott Arnold, Lockheed’s vice president of PAC-3 programs,  welcomed the news and said the company’s missile defense interceptors utilized advanced technology that enabled “better accuracy, enhanced safety and improved reliability when it matters most.” The PAC-3 Missile is a high-velocity interceptor that defends against incoming threats including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft.  Lockheed said the PAC-3 MSE missile uses a two-pulse solid rocket motor that increases altitude and range to meet evolving threats.

Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall told Reuters he believed a new plan that delays completion of the ground system by two years would ultimately succeed, but said the U.S. Defense Department - and he personally - would remain vigilant. Kendall approved the revamped schedule after a Dec. 4 review of the troubled program, whose projected cost has more than doubled to $3.6 billion, including inflation. Kendall said officials were still calculating the new projected cost of the program. “We looked very hard and we considered all possible options. The consensus in the room after we had done so was that we needed to continue” with Raytheon, Kendall said in an interview. “But we’re going to do it with very intense management.” Halting the program and starting over would have added billions of dollars in costs and delayed completion by at least three years, Kendall said.  Kendall said he would meet personally with Raytheon’s chief executive, Tom Kennedy, once a quarter to review progress, and said he has engaged internal and external experts to keep independent tabs on the program. “It’s going to get as intense a management as I can bring to it and I’m expecting to see an improvement in performance,” he  said. “If we don’t, then we can consider some of those options again.” Kendall said he opted for the two-year delay instead of the 47-month delay initially proposed by the Air Force because Kennedy had assured him it was doable, and also because he did not want to “give the program that kind of latitude.” The Air Force’s initial proposal included a year of “pure buffer ... and another year of presumed problems,” he said. Kendall said Raytheon’s problems on the program had gone on for years and the program “has not been executed very well.” He said he and Kennedy would meet early next year to discuss the revised cost estimate and possible changes in the incentive fee structure in the existing cost-plus contract. He said it was not yet clear when the department would assess whether to continue with Raytheon or choose another contractor. Kendall had no immediate details on how much Raytheon’s incentive fee had been docked due to poor performance. He said the issue could affect Raytheon’s ratings in future weapons competitions, which assess “past performance.”         ",12232015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-raytheon-satellites/pentagon-vows-tough-scrutiny-of-raytheon-gps-control-system-idUSKBN0U52HI20151223

Crowley, also appointed Triumph’s president, said he planned to help the company “raise its bar on performance” and would undertake a “top to bottom strategic review” aimed at boosting its  operational performance and margins, while expanding its defense and international business. Crowley will replace Richard Ill, effective Jan. 4. Ill founded Triumph and served has served as CEO since April 2015, after previously serving as CEO from 1993 until his retirement in July 2012. He will remain a member of the board of the Berwyn, Pennsylvania-based company. Triumph shares closed at $40.98 per share, raising the company’s market capitalization more than $300 million, to $1.7 billion. Crowley, who held senior positions with Lockheed Martin Corp before joining Raytheon in 2010, told Reuters he would study the company’s business areas closely before making recommendations on any portfolio changes to the board.”Triumph is in need of some changes in operational execution and strategy,” Crowley said. “But the overall market in which Triumph competes is still a very attractive market,” with expected annual growth of 4 percent of 7 percent per year, spurred by what he called the “democratization of air travel.” He said he had been in touch with the CEOs of key customers, including Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp, Airbus Group SE, Bombardier Inc, the Gulfstream unit of General Dynamics Corp and Brazil’s Embraer SA about his new role, and received positive reactions. “It’s a very competitive business, and Triumph knows that it has to raise its bar on performance,” he said. He said major equipment manufacturers such as Boeing were pressuring suppliers to improve cost, quality and delivery times, and he hoped Triumph could win one of Boeing’s annual operational excellence awards. He said Triumph had been, and would remain, active in the mergers and acquisitions market, but his initial focus would be on better integrating companies acquired in recent years and assessing the strengths of various business units. RBC Capital Markets’ Steven Cahall said the announcement was the catalyst that market had been waiting for.  “The street broadly feels it will take an outsider to shake things up and kick-start a meaningful operational improvement process,” he wrote in a note to investors.

Some analysts and industry executives have suggested Lockheed, the Pentagon’s No. 1 supplier, could sell off Sikorsky’s commercial helicopter business and focus solely on its military division. But Steve O’Bryan, head of business development for Lockheed’s mission systems and training business, said the downturn was affecting all helicopter makers  active in the oil and gas exploration sector. “Lockheed Martin has a steadfast commitment to the commercial helicopter market,” O’Bryan told Reuters at the annual Surface Navy Association conference. He said the company saw opportunities for sales of commercial search and rescue helicopters and VIP transports, which would help offset sales to the oil and gas sector, as well as continued domestic and international military sales. Sikorsky helicopters continue to be utilized at a very high rate in the oil and gas sector, he noted, with low idle time. Demand for military helicopters remains strong in the Middle East and Asia, as well as in eastern Europe, where countries are seeking to replace Soviet-era equipment, O’Bryan said. He said Lockheed was ready to support the new Polish government as it revisits a decision by the previous government to buy utility helicopters built by Airbus Group. The government last month said it would review the helicopter decision, and a separate decision to buy Patriot missile defense equipment from Raytheon Co. O’Bryan cited demand for a range of Sikorsky helicopters, including workhorse H-60 Black Hawks, which he described as “a very mature product with relatively low cost,” as well as the marine version of the helicopters, known as Sea Hawks. The new heavy-lift CH-53K helicopter that Sikorsky is building for the U.S. Marine Corps was also drawing some interest, he said.

Chief Executive Officer Tom Kennedy told analysts that lower oil prices were not hurting demand from the Middle East, and several countries were looking to upgrade existing Patriot missile defense systems. Revenues should rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year, up from an earlier forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent, Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien said. Earnings per share were forecast to increase to $6.80 to $7.00 in 2016, from $6.75 per share in 2015, driven by domestic and international demand for its products and services. Raytheon said international sales hit a record 31 percent of the total in 2015, while total revenues rose 2 percent to $23.2 billion, and should be in the same range this year. Kennedy said Raytheon saw about $5 billion in potential Patriot sales around the world, including a large deal with Poland that could be completed this year. Upgrades to existing systems could add billions more, he said. The company also sees more international demand across Raytheon’s portfolio of products and services, including cybersecurity, Kennedy said.   O’Brien said the company was still looking at smaller acquisitions for both its commercial and defense business as it continued to integrate the $1.9 billion Forcepoint cyber acquisition last year. Raytheon shares rose sharply after the earnings call, jumping 4.1 percent at $122.89, buoyed by the better-than-expected revenue forecast and the CEO’s bullish remarks about foreign sales prospects. Quarterly net earnings fell to $571 million, or $1.85 per share, from $582 million, or $1.86, a year earlier, while revenues rose 3 percent to $6.3 billion.  The acquisition of Forcepoint lowered earnings per share by 8 cents, as expected, Raytheon said. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S looked for earnings per share of $1.81 and $6.3 billion in revenues. Full-year revenue grew for the first time since 2010, a year earlier than expected, and were expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year, up from an earlier forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent, O’Brien said.

451,RTN,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Raytheon sees higher sales, profit in 2016","(Corrects final paragraph to show that domestic sales are slated to rise in 2016, not 2015) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Raytheon Co on Thursday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and forecast higher results for 2016, citing increasing demand from the Middle East, Asia and Europe for precision missiles and missile defense. Chief Executive Officer Tom Kennedy told analysts that lower oil prices were not hurting demand from the Middle East, and several countries were looking to upgrade existing Patriot missile defense systems. Revenues should rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year, up from an earlier forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent, Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien said. Earnings per share were forecast to increase to $6.80 to $7.00 in 2016, from $6.75 per share in 2015, driven by domestic and international demand for its products and services. Raytheon said international sales hit a record 31 percent of the total in 2015, while total revenues rose 2 percent to $23.2 billion, and should be in the same range this year. Kennedy said Raytheon saw about $5 billion in potential Patriot sales around the world, including a large deal with Poland that could be completed this year. Upgrades to existing systems could add billions more, he said. The company also sees more international demand across Raytheon’s portfolio of products and services, including cybersecurity, Kennedy said. O’Brien said the company was still looking at smaller acquisitions for both its commercial and defense business as it continued to integrate the $1.9 billion Forcepoint cyber acquisition last year. Raytheon shares rose 2.2 percent at $120.65 as analysts lauded the better-than-expected revenue forecast.

459,RTN,More U.S. missile defense improvements to be tested this year,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Friday it would test additional improvements to its ground-based U.S. missile defense system later this year during a first test of the system’s ability to intercept an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency on Thursday conducted a successful non-intercept test aimed at demonstrating the effectiveness of a redesigned “kill vehicle,” or warhead, built by Raytheon Co. Missile Defense Agency Director James Syring told the Center for International and Strategic Studies last week that the ICBM intercept test, which will include countermeasures, would take place before the end of the year as part of a broad effort to improve the Ground-Base Midcourse Defense System, or GMD. The United States has been developing the $41 billion weapons system to defeat the long-ranges and high velocities of an ICBM like those being developed by North Korea and Iran. It previously tested and intercepted dummy missiles that simulated short and medium-range ballistic missiles. The MDA is racing to improve the system after it failed to hit a dummy missile in five of eight tests conducted after the Bush administration rushed to deploy the system in 2004 to counter growing threats by North Korea.  Boeing Vice President Norm Tew said the ICBM intercept test would include new technologies infused into the booster used to launch the ground-based interceptors, and other measures aimed at improving the reliability of the exoatmospheric kill vehicle (EKV), or warhead, designed by Raytheon Co. Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp are developing a redesigned kill vehicle for the interceptors, due to have its first flight test in 2018. Tew said he could not comment about whether the U.S. military was considering adding 10 ground-based interceptors to the three now in place at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The U.S. military is already adding 14 interceptors to the 27 interceptors in place at a second site in Alaska. “There are a lot of things being considered,” Tew said, noting that the Obama administration was evaluating possible missile defense sites in the northeastern United States.

Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves, who heads the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center, said officials were keeping close tabs on Raytheon’s GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, which he described as the Air Force’s “No. 1 troubled program.” “OCX has significant promise, but no system is a no-fail system,” Greaves told a breakfast hosted by the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. “Nothing is too big to fail.”Pentagon chief arms buyer Frank Kendall is due to review the $3.6 billion program again in early March after a December restructuring that delayed its completion by two years. Officials have stopped short of cancelling the OCX program, which has seen costs double due to increased cyber requirements and poor contractor performance, citing the importance of the system. OCX will be the first satellite control system designed after the advent of significant jamming and other cyber threats. Greaves said both Kendall and Air Force Secretary Deborah James were demanding improved performance on the program by the company, but he gave no specific deadline for a decision on whether to proceed with the contract. Kendall is expected to review a new cost estimate for the program at his next “deep dive” review, where he will meet with Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy, according to an Air Force spokeswoman. Raytheon spokesman Mike Doble said the company was committed to delivering “without compromise” the modernized ground system and meeting all program requirements as specified by the Air Force.

The U.S. Air Force plans to launch a competition valued at $8 billion to $10 billion in 2017 to replace its aging fleet of T-38 planes, which are nearly 50 years old. It could eventually buy up to 600 planes, analysts said.  Raytheon and Finmeccanica said using an existing aircraft instead of designing a new one would save the Air Force money, and could allow the planes to enter into service years before the target of 2024. Unlike other contenders, the M-346 aircraft had already demonstrated its capabilities for U.S. Air Force officials in Italy in 2014 as they were finalizing their requirements for the new training planes, officials from the companies said. The planes are already being used to train Israeli, Italian and Dutch pilots who will fly Lockheed F-35 fighter jets. Poland and Singapore also recently ordered the Finmeccanica jets for their pilot training programs, Jim Hvizd, vice president of business development for Raytheon’s space and airborne systems division, told reporters at a joint news conference with Finmeccanica. He said Raytheon’s T-100 aircraft, an advanced variant of the M-346, would also keep pilots safer than potential competitors since it had flight control technology that would stabilize the plane automatically if a pilot lost control. Raytheon and Finmeccanica began talks about a joint bid about 16 months ago, he said. Honeywell International Inc  will build the twin F124 turbofan engines to power the planes, and CAE Inc  will supply the ground training system. Raytheon officials said the company was assessing several sites where it would build portions of the plane, but gave no further details. Hvizd said the site would be chosen before the company submitted a full bid. Finmeccanica had previously planned to bid together with another U.S. arms maker, General Dynamics Corp, but General Dynamics said it later withdrew from the team.

472,RTN,Raytheon must face $1 billion whistleblower lawsuit: U.S. appeals court,"(Reuters) - Raytheon Co must defend against a $1 billion whistleblower lawsuit accusing the defense contractor of fraudulently overbilling the U.S. government under a contract to develop a weather sensor for a costly environmental satellite system, an appeals court ruled on Monday.    By a 3-0 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California said an engineer, Steven Mateski, could pursue claims that Raytheon violated the federal False Claims Act for at least a decade starting in 2002. The court said Mateski’s claims went beyond publicly disclosed problems in developing the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which suffered from delays and cost overruns, including problems outlined in a U.S. Government Accountability Office report from November 2005. “If his allegations prove to be true, Mateski will undoubtedly have been one of those whistle-blowing insiders with genuinely valuable information, rather than an opportunistic plaintiff who has no significant information to contribute,” Circuit Judge Michelle Friedland wrote for the appeals court. A spokesman for Raytheon had no immediate comment on the decision. The company is based in Waltham, Massachusetts. Allan Graf, a lawyer for Mateski, said his client was grateful for the decision. Mateski’s allegation was that Raytheon, his employer from 1997 to 2006, mismanaged its subcontract to develop the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor for the NPOESS, on which Northrop Grumman Corp held the main contract. Friedland said it would be unfair to the government and whistleblowers to impose a “public disclosure bar” against False Claims Act lawsuits such as Mateski’s that identified “specific instances of fraud,” where public documents such as the GAO report merely described “problems” or even “generalized fraud.” Monday’s decision overturned U.S. District Judge Otis Wright’s February 2013 dismissal of the lawsuit, and returned the case to his Los Angeles courtroom. False Claims Act cases let whistleblowers pursue claims on behalf of the government and share in recoveries. The United States in 2012 decided not to help Mateski pursue his case.

The court said Mateski’s claims went beyond publicly disclosed problems in developing the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which suffered from delays and cost overruns, including problems outlined in a U.S. Government Accountability Office report from November 2005. “If his allegations prove to be true, Mateski will undoubtedly have been one of those whistle-blowing insiders with genuinely valuable information, rather than an opportunistic plaintiff who has no significant information to contribute,” Circuit Judge Michelle Friedland wrote for the appeals court. A spokesman for Raytheon had no immediate comment on the decision. The company is based in Waltham, Massachusetts. Allan Graf, a lawyer for Mateski, said his client was grateful for the decision. Mateski’s allegation was that Raytheon, his employer from 1997 to 2006, mismanaged its subcontract to develop the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor for the NPOESS, on which Northrop Grumman Corp held the main contract. Friedland said it would be unfair to the government and whistleblowers to impose a “public disclosure bar” against False Claims Act lawsuits such as Mateski’s that identified “specific instances of fraud,” where public documents such as the GAO report merely described “problems” or even “generalized fraud.” Monday’s decision overturned U.S. District Judge Otis Wright’s February 2013 dismissal of the lawsuit, and returned the case to his Los Angeles courtroom. False Claims Act cases let whistleblowers pursue claims on behalf of the government and share in recoveries. The United States in 2012 decided not to help Mateski pursue his case.

SM-6, which currently has anti-air warfare and ballistic missile defense from sea capabilities, is being tested in terminal defense and anti-surface warfare. The company also said the SM-6 successfully engaged five targets, breaking its previous maximum engagement range record set in June 2014. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in February the Pentagon’s five-year budget plan included a $2.9 billion to modify Raytheon’s new SM-6 missiles for use as powerful anti-ship weapons and buy 625 more of the weapons. Raytheon to date has delivered more than 250 SM-6 missiles, first deployed in 2013, the company said.

477,RTN,Top U.S. arms buyer to meet Raytheon CEO on long-delayed GPS ground system,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Pentagon and Air Force officials will meet on Tuesday with Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy for another “deep dive review” of the company’s long-delayed ground control system for next generation GPS satellites, U.S. defense officials said. Pentagon chief arms buyer Frank Kendall, Air Force Secretary Deborah James and other officials will meet with the Raytheon Co (RTN.N) leader in Colorado to review progress made by the company as it struggles to complete the $3.6 billion program after years of schedule delays. The U.S. officials also will receive a new estimate for the cost of delaying the program’s completion by another two years, a decision that was taken last year. Raytheon had no immediate comment about the meeting. Company officials have said they are committed to meeting the Air Force’s requirements for the next-generation control system.

Officials have stopped short of canceling the OCX program, which has seen costs double due to increased cyber requirements and poor contractor performance, citing the importance of the system at a time when China, Russia, Iran and other countries are aggressively attacking U.S. military systems such as GPS. OCX will be the first satellite control system designed after the advent of significant jamming and other cyber threats.

482,RTN,Cost of Raytheon satellite control system rose 16 pct -Pentagon,"WASHINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Thursday said the estimated cost of Raytheon Co’s ground control system for next-generation GPS satellites rose 16.3 percent to $4.2 billion in 2015 - even before a two-year delay decision that will add more cost. The Raytheon GPS Operational Control System (OCX) - dubbed the Air Force’s “No. 1 troubled program” by a top general last month - is now forecast to cost $586.4 million more than the $3.6 billion previously expected. The new estimate is 180 percent over the $1.5 billion value of the contract when it was first awarded to Raytheon in 2010. Costs have soared due to technical issues related to tough cyber requirements, and poor performance, according to Pentagon officials. Air Force spokeswoman Captain Annmarie Annicelli said the new Pentagon estimate reflected cost growth and schedule delays reported during a February 2015 program review, but not further cost overruns and delays that triggered tough program reviews by Pentagon officials in December 2015 and March 2016. The Pentagon’s chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall, decided in December to delay the program’s completion by two years, a move that is expected to further increase the cost of the program. Annicelli said the Air Force was still assessing the impact of those changes and had not yet released a new cost estimate. The Defense Department is due to conduct another comprehensive review of the long-delayed system in about three months together with Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy. Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves, who heads the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center, last month described OCX program as the Air Force’s “No. 1 troubled program.” He said the Air Force was exploring alternatives, including with Lockheed Martin Corp, which builds the newest GPS satellites. The Raytheon program could be canceled if the company did not improve its performance, he said at the time. U.S. military officials have thus far stopped short of canceling the OCX program, citing the importance of the system at a time when China, Russia, Iran and other countries are aggressively attacking U.S. military systems such as GPS.

490,RTN,Raytheon quarterly revenue boosted by strong missile system sales,"(Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor Raytheon Co (RTN.N) reported a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, helped by higher sales in its missile systems business. The company, maker of the Patriot missile system, also raised its 2016 forecast for earnings from continuing operations, partly due to a lower effective tax rate. Sales in Raytheon’s missile systems business, its biggest, jumped 17 percent in the first-quarter ended April 3. The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company said the increase was largely due to higher sales of the Paveway family of laser- and GPS-guided smart bombs, and air-to-air missiles.  Raytheon said quarterly net sales rose about 9 percent to $5.76 billion. Analysts were expecting $5.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares were down slightly at $129.20 in premarket trading on Thursday. Thirty percent of Raytheon’s revenue during the quarter was generated from international customers, with half of them situated in the Middle East and North Africa regions, Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien told Reuters. Lower oil prices had not affected demand from the region, O’Brien said. “As the threats continue to evolve, we do have a set of diverse international customers ... the capabilities that we are providing to these oil producing states continue to be high on their priority list.” O’Brien said Raytheon was expecting a booking from Poland for its Patriot missile system in fiscal year 2017. Last year, Poland's centrist government said it would buy U.S. Raytheon's Patriot missiles in a deal worth an estimated $5 billion. (reut.rs/1WUffIU) O’Brien added that Raytheon also expected a booking in the $1 billion range for an early warning radar system, from Qatar, in the second half of 2016.  Net income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon fell to $428 million in the quarter, or $1.43 per share, from $551 million, or $1.78 per share. The latest quarter was hurt by 8 cents per share of accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of cybersecurity products maker Forcepoint. Raytheon’s backlog was $34.77 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from $34.67 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Raytheon said it now expected to earn $6.93-$7.13 per share in 2016, up from its previous forecast of $6.80-$7.00. The company reiterated its net sales forecast of $24 billion-$24.5 billion.

507,RTN,AIRSHOW-Raytheon upbeat on prospects for Patriot air defence system,"FARNBOROUGH, England, July 11 (Reuters) - Raytheon Co  on Monday said it saw bright prospects for continued sales of its Patriot air defence missile systems, citing strong interest among its 13 operator countries in adding a 360-degree AESA radar to their existing systems. The U.S. government last year gave permission for Raytheon to export the new radar to countries that have Patriot missile defence systems. Raytheon says the new radar gives the system a 360-degree view of potential threats, makes it more reliable to operate, and lower its operating and maintenance costs. Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon’s Integrated Defense Systems business, said regular meetings by Patriot operators to decide on potential software and hardware upgrades meant the weapons system would continue to adapt to evolving threats. “Patriot today is stronger than it’s ever been, and I believe our future is brighter than it’s ever been,” Kremer told Reuters at the Farnborough International Airshow. Kremer declined to provide any detailed estimates on how many 360-degree active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar units the company could sell, but all 13 countries that operate the current system are potential candidates. He said Raytheon was keeping a close eye on developments in Germany, which last year chose Lockheed Martin Corp’s  rival MEADS system to replace its Patriots, in the hope that the decision could still be reversed. The German defence ministry last week notified lawmakers that it might not finish negotiations with Lockheed and local units of Europe’s multinational missile firm MBDA about the MEADS system before year-end, raising questions over whether the deal could be finished before national elections in 2017. Germany announced it would use the MEADS system to replace its Patriot system bought in the 1980s, but set up demanding performance milestones that the companies must meet to retain the contract. Kremer said Raytheon was convinced that Patriot offered Germany a more reliable and proven system that would also be cheaper to operate and modernise in the future than MEADS. “The Germans have ... set up very strict gates or checkpoints along the way that they have to meet, both contractually and technically. This is the first indication that some of those things may be challenging,” he said.

508,RTN,Raytheon work on satellite control system is 'mixed bag': Pentagon,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The Pentagon’s chief arms buyer said his last deep dive review of Raytheon Co’s (RTN.N) work on a ground control system for next-generation GPS satellites was “a mixed bag” showing progress in some areas but continuing problems in others. Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall said he still hoped Raytheon could get the long-delayed program under control since it was critically needed. “It would be very disruptive to stop where we are and start over,” Kendall said, adding that he expected to continue carrying out high-level quarterly reviews. He said Raytheon was putting additional resources into the program, and he still believed that Raytheon could resolve the issues and deliver the system. But he said it was critical that the company continued to improve its performance. His biggest concern now, Kendall said, was that the U.S. Congress could cut funding for the program and make it difficult to execute the work needed now. The Pentagon earlier this year said the estimated cost of Raytheon’s Operational Control System (OCX) rose 16.3 percent, or $586.4 million, to $4.2 billion in 2015 - even before a two-year delay decision that will inflate costs further.

511,RTN,UPDATE 2-Raytheon revenue tops estimates as smart bomb sales rise,"(Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N), the maker of Patriot missile systems, reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue as sales of its Paveway smart bombs increased.  The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company’s shares rose 2.4 percent to $138.60 in premarket trading on Thursday.  Raytheon also raised its 2016 forecast for earnings from continuing operations, partly due to a lower tax rate and fall in interest expenses. The company benefited from a big backlog from previous years, mainly in missile systems and space and airborne systems, Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien told Reuters.  Sales in Raytheon’s missile systems unit, its biggest business, increased 6 percent in the second quarter.  The business, which makes laser- and GPS-guided smart bombs, accounted for more than a quarter of the company’s total revenue.  Sales rose 9.3 percent in the space and airborne systems business, which makes tracking, targeting and navigation sensors for aircraft, drones and missiles, helped by higher revenue from classified programs.  O’Brien said Raytheon got nearly a third of its sales from clients outside the United States. Of this, about half came from the Middle East and Africa regions.  He said weak oil prices did not hurt the company’s business in the Middle East. “Our customers in that region are spending from a defense point of view on high priority areas that protect both their sovereignty and their citizens,” O’Brien said.  Raytheon raised its full-year earnings forecast to $7.13-$7.33 per share from $6.93-$7.13, leaving its net sales forecast unchanged at $24 billion-$24.5 billion. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $7.18 per share and revenue of $24.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Raytheon could win a contract by late 2017 from the Polish government, if Poland and the United States reach an agreement on the Patriot missile defense system by the end of this year, O’Brien said.  This month, Poland’s defense minister said the country had made significant progress in its talks with Raytheon over a $5-billion missile defense system. Net income attributable to Raytheon rose 40.4 percent to $709 million, or $2.38 per share, in the quarter ended July 3, including a gain related to the restructuring of its ThalesRaytheonSystems joint venture and a tax benefit. Total revenue rose 3.2 percent to $6.04 billion, comfortably beating the average analyst estimate of $5.83 billion.

512,RTN,EXCLUSIVE-Japan to upgrade Patriot batteries for Olympics as N.Korean missile threat grows-sources,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is upgrading its Patriot PAC-3 missile defense system in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, adding range and accuracy needed to intercept more advanced North Korean ballistic missiles, four sources with knowledge of the plan said. The move represents the most significant upgrade to Japan’s missile defense system in a decade and is part of an increase in military spending in the region, where geopolitical tensions are rising.  The rollout of the new advanced Missile Segment Enhancement, which could double the range of the current PAC-3 missiles to around 30 km (19 miles), will likely start next year, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the project.  “The upgraded PAC-3 is necessary to counter the Musudan,” said one source, referring to Pyongyang’s intermediate-range ballistic missile.  North Korea in June test-fired what appeared to be two Musudan rockets. The first failed, but the second traveled 400 km (250 miles), more than halfway towards the southwest coast of Japan and reached a height of 1,000 km - enough altitude to give its warhead a range of more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles). Experts said that test represented a technological advance for the Pyongyang regime, which is also developing nuclear weapons.  It puts it one step closer to being able to lob a warhead that could plunge to its target at speeds of several kilometers a second, potentially too fast for the current PAC-3 batteries that are the last line of defense against missile strikes. South Korea’s military operates the older PAC-2 system and has a program to replace it with the PAC-3 system by 2018, a South Korean defense ministry official said. U.S. forces based in the country were also planning to upgrade their PAC-3 batteries covering the capital Seoul, the official added.  Along with North Korea’s missile and nuclear tests, tensions in Asia are being fueled by ongoing territorial disputes between China and Japan in the East China Sea, and between China and several Southeast Asian nations in the South China Sea.  China is swiftly modernizing its armed forces, in part to counter what it sees as a strategy of containment in the United States’ Asian “pivot”. A spokesman for Japan’s Defence Ministry said “nothing has been decided” on the PAC-3 upgrade. The International Olympic Committee’s decision to grant Tokyo the 2020 games will help unlock funding for the PAC-3 upgrade despite military budget constraints, the sources told Reuters.  Around 100 billion yen ($955 million) in funding would be requested in the next defense budget proposal for the year starting April 2017, one of the sources said. Funding will need cabinet approval before going into the national budget and additional funds would have to be approved for subsequent years. Japan is also considering purchasing the advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, anti-missile system, which Washington and Seoul agreed to deploy in South Korea earlier this month. That decision sparked a complaint from China, which said it would destabilize the regional security balance. The Patriot upgrade would likely be an enhancement to Japan’s ballistic missile defense, rather than an alternative to THAAD or a similar system. Japan also has Aegis-equipped destroyers patrolling the Sea of Japan that are loaded with interceptor missiles designed to hit incoming projectiles. It is currently developing a new version dubbed the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) with the United States designed to destroy ballistic warheads in space, although no decision on a roll out has yet been made. The PAC-3 system was developed by Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co. Japan’s biggest defense contractor, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), will begin work on Japan’s systems under license after April next year, the sources said. MHI will upgrade 12 batteries in the first year, another 12 the following year with four in the subsequent twelve months, the sources said. Those guarding the Tokyo area will take priority and some used for training will not be upgraded. “The Ministry of Defence has not made any announcement regarding this, so as a commercial company we are not in a position to comment,” a MHI spokeswoman said. Raytheon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a Lockheed spokeswoman said the company had “a long and successful history of working with Japanese industry in their production of the PAC-3 missile system under license”.

Sales in Raytheon’s space and airborne systems business also jumped 10 percent to $1.59 billion, helped by higher revenue from an international classified program. Raytheon’s space and airborne systems business makes tracking, targeting and navigation sensors for aircraft, drones and missiles. On a call with analysts, management said prospects for 2017 were upbeat, citing a potential for sales to grow up to 5 percent. Raytheon’s Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien said the company will continue to invest in itself, but also return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  O’Brien, on the analyst call, said Raytheon would “pursue targeted acquisitions.” In an interview with Reuters, he added: “We do not see any major multibillion-dollar acquisitions out in front of us.”  Net income attributable to Raytheon rose 18.3 percent to $529 million, or $1.79 per share, in the quarter from $447 million, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier. Raytheon said third-quarter earnings included a favorable financial accounting standard and cost accounting standard adjustment of 23 cents.  Total sales rose to $6.03 billion from $5.78 billion.  Raytheon said its bookings increased 30.6 percent to $6.94 billion in the third quarter. Bookings is a forward-looking metric that measures the value of firm orders won by Raytheon.  The company raised and also tightened its expected earnings  per share to $7.28-$7.38 for 2016. The previous forecast was $7.13-$7.33.  The company also increased the lower end of its 2016 net sales forecast and said it now expected sales of $24.2 billion to $24.5 billion. The company had earlier pegged the low end of its revenue forecast at $24.0 billion.

533,RTN,Raytheon says Germany could get Patriot upgrades in a year,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Co said on Friday it could start upgrading Germany’s Patriot missile defense system in about a year if Berlin decides against a rival system built by Europe’s MBDA and U.S.-based Lockheed Martin Corp. Wes Kremer, who heads Raytheon’s Integrated Defense Systems division, said the company could also upgrade Germany’s Patriot system for less than the estimated cost of the rival Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), made by MBDA and Lockheed,. Raytheon lost out on the work last year when Germany picked the MEADS system, but the company is keeping close tabs on the defense ministry’s slow-moving efforts to hammer out a contract with MBDA. Sources familiar with the matter say the MBDA’s formal proposal for the program came in billions of euros higher than the previous estimate of 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) when it was submitted in September. Some ministry officials have already raised the possibility of upgrading Patriot given the jump in the MEADS projected cost, the sources said.  “They refer to us as the Plan B,” Kremer told Reuters in an interview during a visit to Berlin. “I’m confident we can do it for much less than the MEADS budget.” Raytheon argues that upgrading the Patriot system would save Germany money in the short and long term, allowing it to continue to benefit from upgrades and reliability improvements funded by all 13 countries that operate the system. If Berlin stuck with the MEADS system, it alone would be responsible for all such modifications and updates, Kremer said. “Europe and NATO is about pooling resources and pooling money to work together ... and Patriot really is the epitome of that,” he said. The MEADS system was developed jointly by Germany, Italy and the United States over the last decade, although the U.S. Army later decided not to buy the system for its own use.  The German defense ministry says it is still reviewing the bid submitted by MBDA, jointly owned by Airbus Group, Britain’s BAE Systems Plc and Italy’s Leonardo Finmeccanica SpA. MBDA has declined to comment. Kremer said Germany could quickly upgrade the capability of its Patriot system to match upgrades now being carried out by the United States.  Berlin could later acquire a 360-degree radar that is to be developed as part of a separate program for which Raytheon is bidding in Poland. That radar system would take about five years to complete, he said. MEADS, which is also vying for the Polish work, includes a 360-degree radar system that has already been developed and tested. Kremer, who met with Polish officials in Warsaw this week, said he remained confident Raytheon and the U.S. government would eventually complete a contract with Poland despite Warsaw’s decision to continue talks with Lockheed about MEADS. He declined to estimate when the agreement could be completed. Kremer said Raytheon had made good progress in working out arrangements for at least 50 percent of the work to be carried out in Poland. “We are on a path to closure for this,” he said.

NATO member Poland has sped up efforts to overhaul its military following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and Moscow’s renewed military and political assertiveness in the region. Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz said on Friday Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) had repeatedly violated Poland’s airspace. The Rzeczpospolita daily, citing border guard documents, said Russia has sent its drones over Poland from the Kaliningrad Region at least four times this year. “Unfortunately, we have to say that threats associated with (Russian) drones are nothing new, it is a process that we have observed throughout the year,” PAP news agency cited Macierewicz as saying.  Poland asked Washington in September for approval to buy the systems, aiming to close a $5 billion deal that is central to a thorough modernization of its armed forces by 2023. As advanced military technology, special permission must be obtained from the U.S. government for purchase.     “Concrete decisions are expected within the next few months,” John Baird, vice president of Raytheon Poland programs, told the private Newseria Biznes agency. Poland is also in talks with Lockhead Martin’s MEADS joint venture regarding the acquisition of Medium Extended Air Defense Systems (MEADS).

542,RTN,Israel completes advanced testing of mid-range missile interceptor,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel has completed successful tests of an advanced version of its ‘David’s Sling’ intermediate missile interceptor system that it is developing jointly with the United States, the Defence Ministry said on Wednesday. The system is designed to shoot down rockets with ranges of 100 to 200 km (63 to 125 miles) such as those in the arsenal of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, a Lebanese group which last fought a war with Israel in 2006, or aircraft or low-flying cruise missiles. An initial version of David’s Sling completed testing in December 2015 and has been handed over to the Israeli air force but it has not yet been declared operational, a ministry official said. The system is being developed and manufactured jointly by Israel’s state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd and Raytheon Co, a top U.S. arms maker.    The advanced testing announced on Wednesday included the interception of air-launched incoming test target missiles high over the Mediterranean, Moshe Patel of the Israel Missile Defense Organization said in a telephone briefing. “The tests were intended to simulate anticipated future threats and in the coming years our system will deliver to the Israeli air force more capabilities and more confidence,” Patel said. David’s Sling will fill the operational gap between the already deployed Iron Dome short-range rocket interceptor and the Arrow ballistic missile interceptor, both of which are in service. Last week Israel handed over control of its U.S.-funded  Arrow-3 missile interceptor, a “Star Wars”-like extension of its capabilities which is designed to safely destroy incoming long-range missiles in outer space. That system has been developed jointly by state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries and U.S. firm Boeing Co..

555,RTN,Poland expects to ink $7.6 billion deal for Patriot systems by end-2017,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland expects to sign a deal worth up to $7.6 billion with U.S.  firm Raytheon to buy eight Patriot missile defense systems by the end of the year, Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said on Friday. Warsaw sees the deal as central to a thorough modernization of its armed forces by 2023, in light of what Macierewicz called  “growing aggression and a growing threat from the East.” NATO member Poland has sped up efforts to overhaul its military following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 and in response to Moscow’s renewed military and political assertiveness in the region. “Those systems allow us to guarantee the security of the Polish state,” Macierewicz told a news conference. The contract still requires approval from the U.S. Congress, as it involves a purchase of advanced military technology for which special permission must be obtained. “It’s premature to say that it is all done,” Bill Schmieder, Raytheon’s head for Europe, told the same briefing. “But we have very high hopes that the process will proceed normally.” The Patriot mobile missile defense interceptors are designed to detect, track and engage unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cruise missiles and short-range or tactical ballistic missiles. Poland should receive the first of the Patriot systems within two years of signing the contract, Macierewicz said. All of the units would come with the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), designed to give commanders a better perspective of their operating environment to make better informed decisions. Starting with the delivery of the third system, the Patriots will also be equipped with 360-degree surveillance radars. Poland spends about 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, in line with NATO’s target. But some military officials are pressing for more, saying nearly two-thirds of hardware dates from the era when the country was in the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact.

557,RTN,"US STOCKS-Wall St drops on weak jobs data, missile strikes on Syria","* About 98,000 jobs added in March vs est. 180,000 * U.S. fires missiles at Syrian air base late Thursday * Raytheon, Lockheed gain after US strikes on Syria * Indexes dip: Dow 0.15 pct, S&P; 0.17 pct, Nasdaq 0.26 pct (Updates to open) By Yashaswini Swamynathan April 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped in volatile trading on Friday morning as a disappointing U.S. jobs report added to investors’ nervousness following a U.S. missile strike on Syria. U.S. employers added about 98,000 jobs in March, the lowest in 10 months and well below economists’ expectation of 180,000. The report from the Labor Department was an outlier among a spate of recent positive economic data. Financial stocks were hit the most. The S&P; 500 financial index was down 0.4 percent, led by banks. The United States fired several missiles late on Thursday at an airfield in Syria from which a deadly chemical attack was launched earlier this week. That news of the attack sent global stocks lower, with the S&P; 500 futures index falling as much as 0.5 percent. But most of the losses were pared back after U.S. officials described the attack as a one-off that would not lead to wider escalation. “You are still at all-time highs and a disappointing headline number gives them (investors) a reason for a quick knee-jerk reaction like that,” said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Omaha. “But it wouldn’t surprise me at all if we gain a little momentum back because this number doesn’t portray an economy that is in trouble or slowing down and investors will start to look through that.” At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 31.67 points, or 0.15 percent, at 20,631.28, the S&P; 500 was down 4.09 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,353.4 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 15.16 points, or 0.26 percent, at 5,863.80. Defense stocks jumped on news of the U.S. missile strike. Raytheon, which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles used in the strike, was up 3.1 percent. Lockheed Martin was up 1.4 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,549 to 1,052. On the Nasdaq, 1,595 issues fell and 764 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed eight 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 23 highs and 14 lows.

559,RTN,U.S. lawmakers raise doubts on sale of smart bombs to Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. lawmakers said on Monday they had requested more information from President Donald Trump’s administration about the potential sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia, expressing concern about civilian casualties in Riyadh’s campaign in Yemen that delayed the deal last year. Thirty mostly Democratic lawmakers signed the letter to U.S. Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, citing expectations that the administration plans to go ahead with the sale. “As you know, the previous administration made the decision in December 2016 to halt a planned sale of precision-guided munitions (PGM) to Saudi Arabia due to concerns over widespread civilian casualties and significant deficiencies in RSAF’s (the Saudi Air Force’s) targeting capabilities,” the letter, dated Friday but released on Monday, said. “According to recent reports, however, the State Department has now reversed course and removed the suspension on these PGM sales,” they said in the letter, led by Representative Ted Lieu, a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The State and Defense Departments do not comment on planned arms sales before formal notification is sent to Congress. In December, then-President Barack Obama’s administration decided to halt the sale of the systems, manufactured by Raytheon Co, that convert bombs into precision-guided munitions because of concerns about the extent of civilian casualties during Saudi Arabia’s campaign in Yemen. Congressional aides told Reuters the Trump administration was on the verge of sending a formal notification to Congress about the sale, which would trigger the formal 30-day review to allow members of Congress to attempt to pass legislation to stop any sale. Trump has said he wants to clear the way for U.S. arms sales abroad, to bolster efforts by U.S. partners to fight militant groups and help create U.S. jobs. His administration recently told Congress it also planned to pursue sales to Bahrain and Nigeria that had been delayed under Obama by human rights concerns. Congressional aides said they expected an effort to pass legislation to stop the PGM sale. However, such legislation has never succeeded. A measure seeking to block the sale of tanks to Riyadh failed in September. “It is in our national security interest – as well as that of our Saudi partners - to ensure that the RSAF has the ability to avoid civilian casualties before the U.S. sells them any additional air-to-ground munitions,” the letter said.

562,RTN,Tomahawk missile maker Raytheon's sales rise 3.4 percent,"(Reuters) - Tomahawk missile maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) sees increased demand fueling the company’s growth as a pro-defense Trump administration and U.S. allies grapple with geopolitical instability, it said on Thursday as it reported improved quarterly results. Raytheon shares hit an all-time high after the company reported a 3.4 percent rise in revenue, helped by sales in its divisions that make Tomahawk cruise missiles and electronic warfare systems. The stock rose to $158.86 in New York trading before giving up some of the gains.  Thomas Kennedy, Raytheon’s chief executive officer, told Wall Street analysts during a conference call: “The tempo in Syria is pretty up right now.” He added that Raytheon is seeing significant demand “to provide solutions and keep up with the replenishment requirements.”  The U.S. Navy fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian air base earlier this month, and the U.S. military caries out daily missile strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq as the United States prefers not to put large numbers of soldiers directly in harm’s way. Raytheon, which also makes Patriot missile systems, said total sales rose to $6.00 billion from $5.80 billion a year earlier. Income from continuing operations rose to $1.73 per share, from $1.43 per share. Analysts on average had expected first-quarter sales of $5.83 billion, and earnings from continuing operations of $1.61 per share. Raytheon also raised its 2017 forecast for sales by about $100 million, to $24.9 billion-$25.4 billion, and earnings from continuing operations by 5 cents per share, to $7.25-$7.40. Analysts on average were expecting sales of $25.09 billion, and earnings of $7.40 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Toby O’Brien, Raytheon’s chief financial officer, told Reuters that even if the U.S. government struggles to pass a budget this fiscal year, the company’s projections would not be affected significantly. Raytheon grew its order backlog during the quarter to $36 billion, with 41 percent of that from international customers, O’Brien said.  Revenue in Raytheon’s space and airborne systems business, its second-biggest unit by sales, rose 7.6 percent to $1.56 billion in the first quarter ended April 2, helped by higher sales of an electronic warfare systems program.  Operating margins in the unit increased to 12.2 percent, from 11.6 percent. The business accounted for about 26 percent of Raytheon’s quarterly revenue. The unit makes electronic warfare systems for tactical aircraft, helicopters and ships, as well as tracking and navigation sensors used on airborne platforms, among other products. Sales in the company’s missile systems unit, which also makes Paveway smart bombs and advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles, rose 1.9 percent to $1.76 billion.  Operating margins in the business rose to 12.3 percent, from 11.1 percent. The missile systems unit, which is Raytheon’s biggest business, accounted for 29.3 percent of its quarterly revenue. Bookings fell 8.3 percent to $5.69 billion in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier. Bookings is a forward-looking metric that measures the value of firm orders won by Raytheon. Raytheon’s single biggest booking of the first quarter was an early warning radar system for Qatar, O’Brien said.

On Friday, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded Raytheon four contracts to sell a total of 280 SM-2 Block IIIA and IIIB missiles to the Netherlands, South Korea, Japan and Australia.  The deal could keep the Arizona production line open through 2035 because Raytheon anticipates more orders as the United States and its allies rebuild their inventories using the modernized production line, Lawrence told Reuters. SM-2 missiles are often used to defend ships against anti-ship missiles and aircraft. They have a range of about 90 nautical miles. The U.S. Congress would be notified shortly of the proposed Foreign Military Sales, Lawrence said. Congress must approve most major foreign weapons sales. Delivery of the weapons could begin in 2020 Lawrence added. The order will add to Raytheon’s $36 billion order backlog. More than 41 percent of Raytheon’s backlog was international customers at the end of the quarter reported in April. Raytheon is based in Waltham, Massachusetts-based and had 2016 sales of $24 billion. It has 63,000 employees.

583,RTN,Romania says any Patriot missile system buy meant to boost defence,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian military purchases are not intended to put strain on relations with nearby Russia but to strengthen the country’s defenses, President Klaus Iohannis said on Saturday. Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department said it has approved the possible sale of seven Patriot missile defense systems worth $3.9 billion to Romania. A NATO member since 2004 and European Union member since 2007, Romania has committed to boost its defense spending to two percent of gross domestic product this year. Asked whether talk of acquiring Patriot missiles and recent military drills were straining relations with Russia, Iohannis told reporters: “Firstly, we must look at what these acquisitions are for.”  “We are not getting ready to attack anyone. We are preparing ... for our army to benefit from modern, efficient features. They are meant to defend us, to guarantee the security of Romanians.” Asked whether recent regional military exercises could deter Russia, Iohannis said “Of course they could, and I think they do so.” Russia, whose annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 prompted concern among NATO’s eastern members such as Poland and the Baltic states, has said NATO was threatening stability in Eastern Europe by building up its military presence there and staging war games. A final decision by Romania to buy the missile defenses systems, whose prime contractors would be Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, has yet to be announced by the country’s defense ministry.

586,RTN,"Tomahawk missile maker Raytheon sales rises, boosts profit forecast","(Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N) reported a 4.2 percent rise in quarterly sales as heightened U.S. and allied military operations and global uncertainty increased demand for laser-guided bombs and missiles, compelling the Tomahawk missile maker to raise its annual sales and profit forecasts for the second time this year. Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien told Reuters on Thursday that “all the key metrics - bookings, sales earnings per share, operating cash flow - were better than what we had expected.” Still, the company predicted full-year bookings just short of last year’s record after a big one-time contract last year.  Raytheon’s shares were down 0.38 percent at $168.24 on the New York Stock Exchange in late morning trading. Raytheon’s shares have so far risen 19.4 percent this year, slightly better than the 18.5 percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace and Defense index .DJUSAE. The Waltham, Massachusetts-based weapons maker raised its 2017 sales forecast by about $200 million to between $25.1 billion and $25.6 billion, and its expectation for earnings from continuing operations by 10 cents to a range of $7.35 to $7.50 per share, O’Brien said. Raytheon, which also makes the Patriot missile system, said sales in its missile systems unit, its biggest by revenue, surged 11.4 percent to $1.90 billion in the second quarter ended July 2. The gain was helped by higher sales of the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2), Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), and Paveway family of laser and GPS precision-guided bombs. Raytheon management told analysts on Thursday’s post-earnings conference call that third quarter sales would be in the range of $6.18 billion to $6.33 billion with full-year bookings going as high as $26 to $27 billion for the year. Raytheon ended 2016 with a record $27.8 billion in bookings, according to the company’s annual report. Raytheon’s favorable billings during the quarter were “driven by numerous orders across the divisions versus any big mega award, bodes well,”  Robert Stallard an analyst at Vertical Research LLC, said in a note on Thursday. SM-2s are often used to defend ships against missiles and aircraft. They have a range of about 90 nautical miles. SM-3s destroy incoming ballistic missile threats in space using sheer impact that is equivalent to a 10-ton truck traveling at 600 miles per hour. Revenue in Raytheon’s space and airborne systems business, its second-biggest, rose about 4 percent to $1.61 billion, helped by higher sales from a classified domestic program. The unit makes electronic warfare systems for tactical aircraft, helicopters and ships, as well as tracking and navigation sensors used on airborne platforms, among other products. Forcepoint, a commercial cyber-security company within Raytheon, grew to nearly $600 million in business by the end of 2016 and has had sales of $282 million so far in 2017. The division has been the subject of initial public offering rumors in media reports.  Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy said there are “no plans ... to do an IPO in the near future. And so I’ll take that off the table,” in response to an analyst’s question on Forcepoint during Thursday’s conference call.     Raytheon’s total sales rose to $6.28 billion in the second quarter from $6.03 billion a year earlier. Net income attributable to Raytheon fell to $553 million, or $1.89 per share, from $717 million or $2.41 per share. Analysts has predicted second quarter earnings per share of $1.76, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations included a 9-cent charge relating to the early retirement of debt, while year-ago earnings from continuing operations included a tax-free gain of 53 cents.

593,RTN,Raytheon wins end to whistleblower's $1 billion satellite lawsuit,"(Reuters) - Raytheon Co (RTN.N) on Thursday won the dismissal of a $1 billion whistleblower lawsuit accusing the defense contractor of overbilling the U.S. government on a contract for satellite sensors, nearly 1-1/2 years after a federal appeals court revived the case. U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles said Steven Mateski, an engineer who worked for Raytheon from 1997 to 2006, failed to adequately allege that the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company submitted a false claim, or that its actions were material to the government’s payment decisions. A lawyer for Mateski did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the False Claims Act case, which began in 2006. Raytheon did not immediately respond to a similar request. Mateski had accused Raytheon of mismanaging a subcontract to develop a weather sensor for the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), on which Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) held the main contract. In March 2016, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Mateski’s claims went beyond known problems in developing the NPOESS, which suffered from delays and cost overruns, and overturned Wright’s dismissal of the case three years earlier. But in Thursday’s decision, Wright said Mateski’s fraud allegations remained too general, and his “barebones” allegations regarding materiality also required dismissal. Wright pointed to Raytheon’s counterargument that any alleged misrepresentations were not material to the government’s payment decisions, given how the government kept paying its invoices long after being alerted to alleged suspect claims. Mateski had amended his complaint five times, and Wright said he would not permit a sixth amended complaint. False Claims Act cases let whistleblowers pursue claims on behalf of the government and share in recoveries. The United States decided in 2012 not to help Mateski pursue his case.

597,RTN,"U.S. Air Force picks Raytheon, Lockheed for next-gen cruise missile","(Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force has awarded Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co separate $900 million contracts to continue work on a replacement for the AGM-86B air-launched nuclear cruise missile, the Pentagon said on Wednesday. Although the award for the new Long Range Standoff weapon (LRSO) comes amid rising tensions with North Korea, the Air Force had asked the defense industry last summer for proposals to replace the aging nuclear cruise missiles and intercontinental ballistic missile system as the military moved ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems. “This weapon will modernize the air-based leg of the nuclear triad,” said Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson in a statement. LRSO, which is a plane launched weapon, “will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced integrated air defense systems from significant standoff range” Lockheed Martin said in its statement about the award. The relatively small contract award is a milestone that allows Lockheed and Raytheon to continue parallel detailed development and prototyping for the cruise missile replacement. For the next four and a half years, the companies will perform the technology maturation and risk reduction of the weapon. Once complete, the Air Force will choose a single contractor for engineering, manufacturing and deployment. The Air Force plans to procure approximately 1,000 LRSO flight bodies, with development and procurement costs estimated at about $10 billion, according to an Air Force spokesperson. Only some of the bodies will be armed with nuclear weapons, the others will be used for testing or spares. The Air Force has said it plans to start fielding LRSO by 2030. The current cruise missile was first fielded in the early 1980s with a 10-year life. On Monday, the Air Force awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III ICBM system. Modernization of the U.S. nuclear force was expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade. The United States plans to replace its aging systems, including bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimated the cost at $1 trillion over 30 years.

Although the award for the new Long Range Standoff weapon (LRSO) comes amid rising tensions with North Korea, the Air Force had asked the defense industry last summer for proposals to replace the aging nuclear cruise missiles and intercontinental ballistic missile system as the military moved ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems. “This weapon will modernize the air-based leg of the nuclear triad,” said Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson in a statement. LRSO, which is a plane launched weapon, “will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced integrated air defense systems from significant standoff range” Lockheed Martin said in its statement about the award. The relatively small contract award is a milestone that allows Lockheed and Raytheon to continue parallel detailed development and prototyping for the cruise missile replacement. For the next four and a half years, the companies will perform the technology maturation and risk reduction of the weapon. Once complete, the Air Force will choose a single contractor for engineering, manufacturing and deployment. The Air Force plans to procure approximately 1,000 LRSO flight bodies, with development and procurement costs estimated at about $10 billion, according to an Air Force spokesperson. Only some of the bodies will be armed with nuclear weapons, the others will be used for testing or spares. The Air Force has said it plans to start fielding LRSO by 2030. The current cruise missile was first fielded in the early 1980s with a 10-year life. On Monday, the Air Force awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III ICBM system. Modernization of the U.S. nuclear force was expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade. The United States plans to replace its aging systems, including bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimated the cost at $1 trillion over 30 years.

600,RTN,UPDATE 1-Veritas Capital explores sale of nearly $3 bln in high-tech portfolio assets -sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York-based private equity firm Veritas Capital is exploring the sale of two high-tech portfolio companies, worth nearly $3 billion in total, as it looks to raise cash to fund new deals this Fall, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The potential sales of electronics component maker Excelitas Technologies Corp and radar component-maker Anaren Inc would be a major boost for the U.S. aerospace and defense-related M&A; landscape, which has seen just $1 billion worth of deals so far this year - a 46 percent drop on the same period in 2016.   Veritas has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc to pursue a so-called dual track sale process for Excelitas which could see the Massachusetts-based company sold outright or floated via an initial public offering, the people said. If successful, Excelitas could fetch as much as $2 billion, they added. The private equity firm, which has investments in several national security and tech-sector assets, has also hired bankers to offload Anaren in a separate deal that could be worth more than $800 million, the same people told Reuters. Spokespeople for Veritas and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Excelitas and Anaren did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks. Excelitas makes products such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and flash lamps which are used in applications ranging from medical lighting to aerospace and defense equipment. Anaren produces microwave components for wireless, space and defense electronics providers and counts Raytheon Co, Lockheed Martin Corp., and Northrop Grumman Corp as customers. The New York-based company’s microwave assemblies are used in the United States’ Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), the system the U.S. military is developing to track intercontinental ballistic missiles launched from places like North Korea. Deals in the aerospace and defense industry have slowed this year after the election of President Donald Trump sent asset prices soaring, making many buyers hold off on deals.  Bucking the trend is a potential $20-plus billion mega-deal between two aircraft parts-makers United Technologies Corp and Rockwell Collins Inc, first reported on 4 August. The barren landscape could be could be good for Veritas, with many cash-rich buyers on the scout for assets, but the sensitive nature of the technology involved is also expected to invite intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny, bankers said.  Veritas created Excelitas by acquiring the former illumination and detection solutions business of scientific instruments maker PerkinElmer Inc. for about $500 million in 2010. Excelitas went on to acquire more companies, including Kaiser Systems Inc, a manufacturer of high-voltage power systems, and Qioptiq, a maker of specialized optical components and lenses. Veritas had previously attempted to sell Excelitas in 2014, Reuters reported at the time, but no deal was reached. In 2014, Veritas paid $383 million to take Anaren private, delisting it from the NASDAQ stock exchange. Both sales are in their early stages and could be called off at any time, the people said.

605,RTN,"UPDATE 3-Turkey will take its own security measures after Russia defence deal, Erdogan says","ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday dismissed NATO allies’ concern over Turkey’s deal to buy a missile defense system from Russia and said Ankara would continue to take the security measures it thought right. Turkey, whose relations with its allies have frayed in recent months, said it opted for the S-400 because Western companies had offered no “financially effective” alternative. But NATO officials have voiced disquiet over the purchase of missiles incompatible with alliance systems. “They went crazy because we made the S-400 agreement. What were we supposed to do, wait for you? We are taking and will take all our measures on the security front,” Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara. Western firms which had bid for the contract included U.S. firm Raytheon (RTN.N), which put in an offer with its Patriot missile defense system. Franco-Italian group Eurosam, owned by the multinational European missile maker MBDA and France’s Thales TCFP.PA, came second in the tender. Turkey, with the second-largest army in the alliance, has enormous strategic importance for NATO, abutting as it does Syria, Iraq and Iran. But the relationship has become fractious. Erdogan has been infuriated by Washington’s support for  Kurdish YPG fighters in the battle against Islamic State in Syria. Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey’s largely Kurdish southeast. The U.S. Pentagon said it had expressed concerns to Ankara about the Russian purchase. “A NATO interoperable missile defense system remains the best option to defend Turkey from the full range of threats in its region,” spokesman Johnny Michael said in a statement. France, however, said Turkey’s decision was a sovereign choice which did not require comment from NATO allies. France’s foreign minister is due to visit Turkey on Thursday. Germany has said it would restrict some arms sales to Turkey, reflecting the diplomatic strain over a security crackdown in Turkey following a failed military coup last year. Berlin had originally sought to freeze major arms sales, but scaled that back after Turkey said that would harm the joint fight against Islamic State. Berlin has criticized mass arrests that followed the failed coup and demanded the release of around a dozen German or Turkish-German citizens arrested in recent months. Turkey originally awarded a $3.4 billion contract for the defense system to China in 2013, but canceled that two years later, saying it would concentrate on developing a system domestically. Turkey later began talks with Russia, and in July Erdogan said the deal had been signed, although negotiations appear to have been drawn out over financing.  Turkish media quoted Erdogan this week as saying he and Russian President Vladimir Putin were determined that the agreement should proceed.

607,RTN,UPDATE 2-U.S. approves possible $15 bln sale of THAAD missiles to Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale of a THAAD anti-missile defense system to Saudi Arabia at an estimated cost of $15 billion, the Pentagon said on Friday, citing Iran among regional threats. The approval opens the way for Saudi Arabia to purchase 44 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) launchers and 360 missiles, as well as fire control stations and radars. “This sale furthers U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, and supports the long-term security of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region in the face of Iranian and other regional threats,” the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation agency said in a statement. Saudi Arabia and the United States are highly critical of what they consider Iran’s aggressive behavior in the Middle East. Iran also has one of the biggest ballistic missile programs in the Middle East, viewing it as an essential precautionary defense against the United States and other adversaries, primarily Gulf Arab states and Israel. THAAD missile systems are deployed to defend against ballistic missile attacks. Saudi-owned al Arabiya television reported on Thursday that the kingdom had agreed to buy Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, an announcement that came as Saudi King Salman made during his visit to Russia, the first by a Saudi monarch. U.S. military sales to Saudi Arabia have come under increased scrutiny over the Saudi-led coalition’s war in Yemen.  Riyadh and its allies have been bombing the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen since the Houthis seized much of the country’s north in 2015. Riyadh says the coalition is fighting terrorists and supporting Yemen’s legitimate government but the office of the U.N. human rights chief has said Saudi-led air strikes cause the majority of civilian casualties. Lockheed Martin Co (LMT.N) is the prime contractor for the THAAD system, with Raytheon Co (RTN.N) playing an important role in the system’s deployment. The United States deployed THAAD to South Korea this year to guard against North Korea’s shorter-range missiles. That has drawn fierce criticism from China, which says the system’s powerful radar can probe deep into its territory.

610,RTN,Raytheon's third-quarter revenues miss estimates; could rise 5 percent in 2018,"(Reuters) - Raytheon Co on Thursday posted quarterly revenues that narrowly missed Wall Street estimates, but forecast sales would rise as much as 5 percent next year as the weapons maker benefits from higher defense spending by the Trump administration. Raytheon posted net sales of $6.28 billion, missing Wall Street estimates of $6.33 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at its second largest unit, Space and Airborne Systems, which makes sensors and satellite components, were flat from the previous year with profit margins down slightly. Raytheon (RTN.N) shares slid more than 4 percent to $181.46.  Raytheon reported a 5 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, selling more laser-guided bombs and GPS-guided artillery rounds. The maker of the Patriot missile system is benefiting as U.S. and allied military operations buy more weapons to take on heightened global conflicts and possible threats. During an earnings conference call with analysts, Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien forecast 2018 sales would grow to between $26.2 billion and $26.7 billion, a 3 percent to 5 percent lift. Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon raised the lower end of its 2017 sales forecast by about $200 million to $25.3 billion, and kept the top end unchanged at $25.6 billion.  “This is now 5 to 6 percent sales growth over 2016, and our prior range was 4 to 6 percent,” O’Brien told Reuters. Raytheon increased its full-year 2017 earnings forecast from continuing operations to $7.45 to $7.55 per share, from $7.35 to $7.50 per share, partly due to lower interest expenses and a reduced tax rate.  The company sees 2017 operating cash flow from continuing operations of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. Raytheon and other U.S. weapons makers are expected to benefit in the coming year from an increase in overall defense spending under President Donald Trump’s administration. Sales at its missile systems unit, its biggest by revenue, surged 9.9 percent to $1.95 billion in the quarter, helped by higher sales of the Paveway family of laser-guided bombs and the Excalibur GPS-guided precision projectiles, the company said. Operating margin in the unit rose 1.1 points to 14.4 percent. Sales at its integrated defense systems business, which makes the Patriot missile system and surveillance and search radars, rose 4.3 percent to $1.39 billion, on higher sales from an international early warning radar program. The operating margin rose 0.8 points to 16.6 percent. Raytheon’s overall income from continuing operations rose to $568 million, or $1.97 per share, from $541 million, or $1.84 per share, a year earlier.

The proposed sale includes 208 Patriot Advanced Capabilty-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement missiles, 16 M903 launching stations, four AN/MPQ-65 radars, four control stations, spares, software and associated equipment. In addition, Poland is authorized to buy U.S. government and contractor technical, engineering and logistics support services as well as range and test programs for a total estimated potential program cost of up to $10.5 billion. A Raytheon representative said “it is Raytheon’s experience that the estimated cost notified could be larger than the final negotiated contract amount,” signaling that the final price could be lower as negotiations on a final amount proceed. Raytheon added that is “will work closely with the U.S. and Polish governments to ensure Poland is able to procure Patriot at a mutually agreeable price.” The Pentagon said the sale will take place in two phases.  If a deal is finalized, it would allow Poland to conduct air and missile defense operations with NATO allies the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, and Greece, which currently have the Patriot system, a U.S. State Department official said. The contract still requires approval from the U.S. Congress, because it involves a purchase of advanced military technology for which special permission must be obtained.

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which implements foreign arms sales, said it had delivered notification to Congress on Tuesday. U.S. lawmakers have 30 days to block the sale, but that rarely happens. In addition to Raytheon, the prime contractors will be Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Northrop Grumman (NOC.N).

624,RTN,UPDATE 3-Raytheon gets OK for $10.5 bln Patriot sale to Poland -Pentagon,"(Reuters) - The U.S. State Department approved a possible $10.5 billion sale of Raytheon Co’s (RTN.N) Patriot missile defense system to Poland, the Pentagon said on Friday. NATO member Poland has sped up efforts to overhaul its military following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 and in response to Moscow’s renewed military and political assertiveness in the region.  Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said in March that Poland expected to sign a deal with Raytheon to buy the Patriot missile defense system by the end of the year. Patriot missile defense interceptors are designed to detect, track and engage unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cruise missiles and short-range or tactical ballistic missiles.

632,RTN,U.S. approves anti-ballistic missile sale to Japan amid N.Korea threat,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government has approved the sale of anti-ballistic missiles to Japan to defend itself against a growing nuclear and missile threat from North Korea, a State Department official said on Tuesday. News of the sale comes as North and South Korea hold their first talks in more than two years aimed at solving the crisis over the North’s nuclear missile program. The missile deal follows a year of ramped-up North Korean missile launches, some of them over Japanese territory, and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. These actions have prompted a stepped-up U.S.-led campaign to toughen U.N. sanctions, which Pyongyang has called an act of war. The State Department on Tuesday asked Congress to approve the $133 million sale of the four missiles and related hardware, which can be launched from destroyers at sea or from a land-based system. The sale of the anti-ballistic missiles, made by Raytheon Co (RTN.N) and BAE Systems (BAES.L), follows through “on President Trump’s commitment to provide additional defensive capabilities to treaty allies threatened by the DPRK’s provocative behavior,” the official said, using the initials for North Korea. Japan formally decided in December it would expand its ballistic missile defense system with U.S.-made ground-based Aegis radar stations and interceptors. The proposal to build two Aegis Ashore batteries without the missiles will likely cost at least $2 billion and was not likely to be operational until 2023 at the earliest, sources familiar with the plan told Reuters in December. U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Japan Minister of Defense Itsunori Onodera, in a phone call on Monday, “condemned North Korea’s reckless and unlawful behavior,” according to a Pentagon statement.

635,RTN,Raytheon says corporate tax cut set to boost future profits,"(Reuters) - Tomahawk missile maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) said on Thursday a recent U.S. corporate tax cut allowed it to pre-pay some 2018 pension obligations, freeing up funds the company can return to shareholders. The tax cut windfall also spurred Raytheon to boost its earnings forecasts for 2018 well above analyst estimates as it reported an 8 percent rise in revenue, sending its shares up 2 percent in midday trading. The $1 billion pre-tax discretionary pension plan contribution at the end of 2017 pushed cash flow projections for 2018 up by half a billion dollars, giving the maker of Patriot missile defenses ample room to continue its target of returning 80 percent of free cash to shareholders.  The company said it will focus on “returning capital to shareholders through share buy backs and dividends, making small targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs,” said Raytheon’s finance chief, Toby O’Brien. Other companies with pension plans were also expected to use the tax cut windfall to front-load pension contributions before tax rates fall in 2018. Indeed, Lockheed Martin Co’s (LMT.N) chief financial officer, during a third-quarter conference call with analysts, said his company was contemplating such a move. Lockheed will announce results on Monday. Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon, whose shares touched an all time high of $204.38 on Thursday, stands to benefit from higher overall U.S. defense spending under President Donald Trump’s and form U.S. allies. A lower effective tax rate in 2018 prompted the U.S. defense contractor to forecast full-year earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $9.55 to $9.75, much higher than the average analyst estimate of $8.87. Raytheon’s overall sales rose to $6.78 billion in the quarter, from $6.28 billion a year earlier, narrowly missing analyst estimates for $6.81 billion. However, income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon fell to $393 million, or $1.35 per share, from $555 million, or $1.87 per share, a year earlier. “We are really pleased with the results we announced here for closing out 2017, and certainly the guidance that we gave for 2018,” O’Brien told Reuters in an interview as the company reported a record $25.3 billion in sales for the year. The weapons maker said its 2018 net sales would increase 4 to 6 percent to a range of $26.4 billion-$26.9 billion, against analyst expectations for $26.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company expects 2018 operating cash flow from continuing operations to be between $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in 2017. About 40 percent of Raytheon’s order backlog was from non-U.S. customers, helping the company diversify its sources of revenue. O’Brien told Reuters recent changes to the U.S. tax code were already making Raytheon “more globally competitive.” Sales at Raytheon’s missile systems unit, its biggest by revenue, grew 15.2 percent to about $2.19 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, as it sold more medium-range air-to-air missiles, Paveway laser-guided bombs and SM-3 anti-ballistic missiles. Sales in space and airborne systems, its second-biggest by revenue, rose 4.4 percent to $1.67 billion, with more airborne radars sold. The unit makes electronic warfare systems for tactical aircraft, helicopters and ships, as well as tracking and navigation sensors used on airborne platforms.     Besides the front-loaded pension contributions, Raytheon had another unanticipated U.S. tax reform-related charge in the fourth quarter, including $171 million that was not included in the company’s prior forecast.

Poland’s defence ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment, but Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said in late January that he expected the deal to be signed by the end of the first quarter. The proposed sale includes 208 Patriot Advanced Capabilty-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement missiles, 16 M903 launching stations, four AN/MPQ-65 radars, four control stations, spares, software and associated equipment. In addition, Poland is authorized to buy U.S. government and contractor technical, engineering and logistics support services as well as range and test programs.  The deal approved in November by the U.S. State Department envisaged the sale totaling up to $10.5 billion, but two sources told Reuters that Poland has received different options with different individual components and different offset scenarios. The sources estimated the options at up $4.5 billion - $5.5 billion, but said the negotiations are not over yet.

Poland on Wednesday signed an agreement with the U.S. government to buy for four Patriot fire units in the current configuration, and is negotiating with Washington to buy more Patriot systems, a new 360-degree radar, and a low-cost interceptor missile, as part of a second phase of development. “We do expect that Poland will move pretty quickly with Phase II. They have a stated desire to complete that by the end of the year,” Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, told Reuters in a telephone interview. “I’m actually fairly confident that it can get done.” Kremer said a significant amount of preliminary work had already been done by teams from both countries on the scope and content of the follow-on agreement. He gave no details on the possible value of the second deal.

656,RTN,Arming the world: Inside Trump's 'Buy American' drive to expand weapons exports,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a telephone call with the emir of Kuwait in January, U.S. President Donald Trump pressed the Gulf monarch to move forward on a $10 billion fighter jet deal that had been stalled for more than a year. Trump was acting on behalf of Boeing Co (BA.N), America’s second-largest defense contractor, which had become frustrated that a long-delayed sale critical to its military aircraft division was going nowhere, several people familiar with the matter said. With this Oval Office intervention, the details of which have not been previously reported, Trump did something  unusual for a U.S. president – he personally helped to close a major arms deal. In private phone calls and public appearances with world leaders, Trump has gone further than any of his predecessors to act as a salesman for the U.S. defense industry, analysts said. Trump’s personal role underscores his determination to make the United States, already dominant in the global weapons trade, an even bigger arms merchant to the world, U.S. officials say, despite concerns from human rights and arms control advocates. Those efforts will be bolstered by the full weight of the U.S. government when Trump’s administration rolls out a new “Buy American” initiative this week aimed at allowing more countries to buy more and even bigger weapons. It will loosen U.S. export rules on equipment ranging from fighter jets and drones to warships and artillery, the officials said. Reuters has learned that the initiative - which industry sources said will be announced on Thursday - will provide guidelines that could allow more countries to be granted faster deal approvals, possibly trimming back to months what has often taken years to finalize. The strategy will call for members of Trump’s cabinet to sometimes act as “closers” to help seal major arms deals, according to people familiar with the matter. More top government officials will also be sent to promote U.S. weapons at international air shows and arms bazaars. Shares of major U.S. defense contractors added to gains after the news and Raytheon hit an all-time high.  Human rights and arms control advocates warn that the proliferation of a broader range of advanced weaponry to more foreign governments could increase the risk of arms being diverted into the wrong hands and fueling violence in regions such as the Middle East and South Asia. The Trump administration stresses that the main aims are to help American defense firms compete better against increasingly aggressive Russian and Chinese manufacturers and give greater weight than before to economic benefits of arms sales to create more jobs at home. One Trump aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  the new initiative is also intended to ease human rights restrictions that have sometimes led to an effective “veto” over certain arms deals. “This policy seeks to mobilize the full resources of the United States government behind arms transfers that are in the U.S. national and economic security interest,” a White House official said, responding to a request for comment on the story. “We recognize that arms transfers may have important human rights consequences,” the official said. “Nothing in this policy changes existing legal or regulatory requirements in this regard.”  One of the main architects of the new policy has been economist Peter Navarro, a China trade skeptic ascendant in Trump’s inner circle. His effort to boost arms exports has drawn little resistance within the White House, officials said. The initiative has been in the works for months and some of its expected components have already been reported. But with the rollout nearing, more than a dozen industry sources and current and former U.S. officials have provided Reuters with the most complete picture yet of Trump’s policy, though they caution that last-minute changes are still possible. The policy will call for a “whole of government” approach – from the president and his cabinet on down to military attaches and diplomats – to help drum up billions of dollars more in arms business overseas, U.S. officials said. It will also call for cutting red tape to secure faster deal approval on a broader range of weaponry for NATO members, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf partners as well as treaty allies such as Japan and South Korea, among others, they said. Many details will remain classified. Companies that stand to benefit most include Boeing and the other top U.S. defense contractors, Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) , Raytheon Co (RTN.N), General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N). All of their shares have surged by double-digit percentages, led by the doubling of Boeing’s stock price, since Trump took office in January 2017. Trump’s aides also want more senior officials to attend major international arms shows, including cabinet members such as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, to promote U.S.-made weapons the way countries such as France and Israel pitch their companies” wares. “If you go to the Paris air show, you see the French foreign minister standing in front of the Airbus pavilion,” one U.S. official said. “We’re getting outplayed so we have to change our culture.” In addition to the broad arms export initiative, Trump is expected to sign a separate document easing exports of military drones, an item high on foreign governments’ shopping lists, officials said.  U.S. foreign military sales totaled $42 billion last year, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Experts say exports from Russia, the largest U.S. competitor, are typically half those of the United States.  The Aerospace Industries Association trade group said it had first lobbied Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign on the need for “bolstering U.S. manufacturing” and encouraging allies to take more responsibility for their own security. SALESMAN-IN-CHIEF While many presidents have helped promote the U.S. defense industry, none is known to have done so as unabashedly as Trump, a former real estate developer who seems sometimes at his most comfortable when he is promoting U.S. goods. Trump regularly discusses specific arms sales with foreign leaders in meetings and on the phone, according to White House statements. And on a trip to Japan last November, he publicly urged Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to buy more American weapons. More recently, at an Oval Office meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last month, Trump held up posters with pictures of U.S. jets, ships and helicopters and other armaments sold to Saudi Arabia. “We make the best military product in the world,” he boasted to reporters as the prince sat smiling beside him. Other presidents, including Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush stressed the need to strengthen the defense industrial base, but they did it more subtly, said William Hartung, director of the arms and security project at the Center for International Policy, a non-partisan think tank. “Nobody’s been as blatant about it as Trump,” he added. “Nobody has yelled it from the rooftops.” Former President Barack Obama would sometimes talk to allied leaders about weapons systems that he felt suited their security needs, but aides said he preferred to keep weapons salesmanship at arm’s length.  The Trump administration’s plan to overhaul the Conventional Arms Transfer policy, the framework for evaluating foreign sales, goes well beyond Obama’s relaxation of rules in 2014 that enabled U.S. arms contractors to sell more overseas than ever before. Obama drew a clear line, however, requiring each sale to meet strict human rights standards – though he was criticized at times for allowing some controversial sales. Trump has already gone ahead with several deals that Obama blocked, including the sale of $7 billion in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia despite human rights groups’ concerns they have contributed to civilian deaths in the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen’s civil war.  ANATOMY OF A TRUMP-ERA DEAL How Boeing’s Kuwait deal got on Trump’s agenda for the Jan. 17 call with Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber al-Sabah illustrates how seriously the administration is taking the arms export push. The State Department granted approval in November 2016, in the final months of the Obama administration, for Kuwait to buy 40 F/A-18 Super Hornet strike fighters. But Kuwait, a U.S. Gulf ally, appeared to drag out negotiations, U.S. officials and industry sources said, and the purchase was still not finalized by the time the emir visited Trump at the White House last September. Trump told reporters at the time that, at the Kuwaiti leader’s request, he had intervened and won State Department authorization for the deal – a false claim since that approval had already been granted nearly a year earlier. Months later, Boeing’s request for a presidential nudge to Kuwait was channeled to National Security Council aides, who included it among Trump’s “talking points” for the January phone call, two people close to the matter said. This time, Trump did make a difference. Just days later, Kuwaiti state media reported the deal was done. The Kuwaiti government did not respond to requests for comment. A Boeing spokesman declined comment. ",4182018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-arms-insight/arming-the-world-inside-trumps-buy-american-drive-to-expand-weapons-exports-idUSKBN1HO2PT

658,RTN,UPDATE 1-Trump launches effort to boost U.S. weapons sales abroad,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy on Thursday aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it will bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home.  The White House aims to speed up arms deal approvals and increase the role of senior U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump, in closing foreign sales, while giving greater weight to business interests in sales decisions that have long prioritized human rights. The initiative, as first reported by Reuters, adds the full weight of government to Trump’s direct personal role in pushing arms sales during interactions with foreign heads of state.  Companies that stand to benefit from the new policy most include Boeing Co (BA.N) and the other top U.S. defense contractors, Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), Raytheon Co (RTN.N), General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N).     The plans have been in the works for a year, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro playing a major role in driving the project forward. Navarro is best known for pushing the administration to take tough trade actions against China. Human rights will now carry equal weight alongside other considerations in planned arms sales including the needs of allied nations and the economic loss if the U.S. contractor does not win the sale when decisions are made on whether to approve an arms deal. “This is a balanced policy,” said Ambassador Tina Kaidanow, an official with the State Department who oversees arms export agreements. “We absolutely look at human rights as one of a set of considerations that we look at.” In a joint new conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Florida, Trump said late on Wednesday his administration was working to “short circuit” the cumbersome bureaucratic process at the State Department and the Pentagon to expedite arms sales to Japan and other allies.   But giving economic and commercial concerns equal weight to human rights in the arms sales decision-making process raises concerns. “The new policy retains the legally binding language that prohibits weapons transfers when there is actual knowledge that they will be used to commit war crimes,” Brittany Benowitz a former U.S. Senate staffer and lawyer who worked on human rights issues and arms transfers.  “However, the policy did away with the more comprehensive assessment of risks when contemplating a weapons deal. A transaction can still occur to a human rights abuser so long as the U.S. has no specific knowledge that system will be used to commit atrocity crimes,” Benowitz said. The new policy will go well beyond a relaxation of rules for foreign military sales under President Barack Obama in 2014 that enabled U.S. arms contractors to sell more overseas than ever before.  The export policy explicitly states it aims to “strengthen the manufacturing and defense industrial base” and as a part of this “when a proposed transfer is in the national security interest, which includes our economic security, and in our foreign policy interest, the executive branch will advocate strongly on behalf of United States companies.”  Trump has pressed foreign governments to buy more U.S.-made weapons in nearly every call he has had with a head of state of major allies, a State Department official said this week. The planned revision of U.S. weapons export policy also includes a new drone export policy that allows lethal drones that can fire missiles and surveillance drones of all sizes to soon become more widely available to U.S. allies. Two potential beneficiaries of the rule changes, Textron Inc (TXT.N) and Kratos Defense and Security Solutions Inc (KTOS.O), currently market smaller armed drones internationally. The new approach represents a “fundamental shift” in the way the United States sells large armed drones, Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional arms program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, said. The full text of the drone policy will remain classified along a list of potential buyers being given fast-track treatment is expanding to include more countries, a State Department official told Reuters this week.  Previously, U.S. government sources had said that more NATO members, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf partners as well as treaty allies such as Japan and South Korea would be given the favorable treatment regarding drone sales. The Aerospace Industries Association trade group said the policy was an important “first step” and more needed to be done because “increasing demand for American defense products has strained the system, resulting in an overburdened and fragmented process beset by avoidable delays.”     ",4192018,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-arms/update-1-trump-launches-effort-to-boost-u-s-weapons-sales-abroad-idUSL1N1RW18J

The White House aims to cut the time it takes to approve arms deals, lowering the hurdle to bigger sales and sales of more powerful weapons, and increasing the role of senior U.S. officials in shepherding deals across the finish line, as earlier reported by Reuters. The initiative builds on President Donald Trump’s efforts to personally boost arms sales on calls with foreign heads of state. Companies that stand to benefit from the new policy most include Boeing Co and the other top U.S. defense contractors, Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co, General Dynamics Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp. The plans have been in the works for a year, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro playing a major role in driving the project forward.

660,RTN,"Raytheon quarterly profit helped by tax cut, shares slip","(Reuters) - Tomahawk missile maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) reported a better-than-expected 26 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday, but its shares dipped as investors cooled on the sector after double digit gains in the past year. The company was the latest defense stock showing flagging support this week. Defense giants Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) also fell after reporting first quarter earnings. Broader profit taking in defense was cited as the cause for deflation across the sector, analyst Robert Stallard of Vertical Research said in a note, adding “overall fundamental outlook remains robust.”  The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company raised its 2018 profit forecast about 15 cents per share to a range of $9.70 to $9.90, a range that exceeds analysts’ full-year target of $9.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien told Reuters in an interview that about two-thirds of the increase in projected earnings per share was due to tax cuts pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump and passed by the Republican-controlled Congress last year. The rest of the improved forecast reflected higher sales volume at Raytheon’s Integrated Defense Systems unit, which makes the Patriot missile system, he said. That unit also helped the company’s reported first-quarter earnings per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.20 per share top analysts’ average expectation of $2.11 per share. O’Brien said the unit’s 18 percent first-quarter profit margin was up from 15.2 percent in the prior year, “which was considerably higher.” In March, Poland signed a $4.75 billion agreement to buy Raytheon’s Patriot missile defense system as it modernizes its forces against a bolder Russia. Last week, the Trump administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy aimed at expanding sales to allies, benefiting Raytheon and other U.S. weapons makers.  Non-U.S. customers represented about 30 percent of Raytheon’s sales in the first quarter, but the year could see that number go as high as 33 percent, O’Brien said. Raytheon projects its 2018 tax rate to be 18 percent, down from 35.8 percent in 2017. The weapons maker said its 2018 net sales would now be in a range of $26.5 billion to $27.0 billion, up from its previous forecast of $26.4 billion to $26.9 billion. Analysts had expected $26.74 billion. Raytheon, however, kept its 2018 outlook for operating cash flow from continuing operations unchanged at between $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion. Sales at Raytheon’s missile systems unit, its biggest by revenue, rose 5.2 percent to about $1.85 billion in the quarter ended April 1, driven by higher sales from classified programs. Raytheon’s Tomahawk missiles were used in the recent U.S. strikes in Syria. The company said first-quarter operating margin in the unit fell to 11.5 percent from 12.3 percent a year earlier, due to a change in program mix. Sales in Raytheon’s intelligence, information and services business, its second-biggest in the quarter, rose about 5 percent to $1.58 billion. Operating margin was flat at 7.4 percent. Forcepoint, the commercial cybersecurity business had a loss of 7 million in the first quarter. O’Brien reiterated previous guidance that the unit would become profitable in the second half of the year. The company’s income from continuing operations rose to $624 million in the first quarter, from $497 million a year earlier. First-quarter net sales rose 4.5 percent to $6.27 billion.

663,RTN,Raytheon quarterly profit rises about 26 pct on lower taxes,"April 26 (Reuters) - Tomahawk missile maker Raytheon Co reported a 25.6 percent increase in first-quarter profit on Thursday, benefiting from lower taxes. The tax cut windfall is boosting profits at Raytheon, whose operations are also being aided by an increase in overall defense spending under President Donald Trump’s administration. Last week, the administration rolled out here a long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy aimed at expanding sales to allies, benefiting Raytheon and other U.S. weapons makers. Raytheon on Thursday raised its 2018 forecast for earnings per share from continuing operations to between $9.70 and $9.90 from between $9.55 and $9.75, previously, partly due to a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate. The weapons maker said its 2018 net sales would now be in a range of $26.5 billion to $27.0 billion, up from its previous forecast of $26.4 billion to $26.9 billion. Analysts on average were expecting full year profit of $9.71 per share, and sales of $26.74 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Raytheon, however, kept its 2018 outlook for operating cash flow from continuing operations unchanged between $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion. Sales at Raytheon’s missile systems unit, its biggest by revenue, rose 5.2 percent to about $1.85 billion in the quarter ended April 1, driven by higher sales from classified programs. The company said operating margin in the unit fell to 11.5 percent from 12.3 percent a year earlier, due to a change in program mix. Sales in Raytheon’s intelligence, information and services business, its second-biggest in the quarter, rose about 5 percent to $1.58 billion. Operating margin was flat at 7.4 percent. The company’s income from continuing operations rose to $624 million in the first quarter, from $497 million a year earlier. Income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon common stockholders was $2.20 per share, compared with $1.73 per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose 4.5 percent to $6.27 billion.
