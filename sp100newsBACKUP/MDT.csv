1,MDT,UPDATE 2-Medtronic deals to expand surgical device offerings," * To acquire two privately held companies   * Currently has ownership stake in both companies   * To expand presence in advanced energy surgical devices  (Rewrites first paragraph, adds Salient deal, detail, analyst comment, stock price)   CHICAGO, July 7 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) on Thursday said it struck deals to acquire two privately held companies in a bid to expand its presence in advanced surgical devices dominated by rivals Covidien Plc COV.N and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N).   Medtronic, the world’s largest stand alone medical device company, agreed to buy the part of Salient Surgical Technologies Inc that it does not already own, for about $480 million.   Including Medtronic’s existing ownership stake in the manufacturer of instruments used for haemostatic sealing of soft tissue and bone, the value of the transaction is $525 million.   Salient has annualized revenue of about $100 million.   Salient’s devices are used in a variety of surgical procedures including orthopedic surgery, spine, open abdominal and thoracic procedures.   Its products use its patented Transcollation technology to provide haemostatic sealing of soft tissue and bone. Its AquaMantys product line is used primarily in orthopedic cases, including hip and knee replacement, trauma, and spine procedures.   Medtronic also announced plans to buy Peak Surgical Inc, which makes high-tech surgical cutting and coagulation instruments.   Medtronic currently holds an ownership stake in Peak. Excluding the existing stake, the transaction value is about $105 million. Including the stake, the transaction value is $120 million.   Peak, with annualized revenue of roughly $20 million, specializes in surgical instruments based on its proprietary PlasmaBlade technology.   The PlasmaBlade line consists of a family of disposable cutting devices with proprietary insulation technology that provides the exacting control of a scalpel and the bleeding control of traditional electrosurgery with minimal thermal tissue damage.   The technology is cleared for use in a variety of settings, including ear, nose and throat; plastic/reconstructive; orthopedic; and general surgical applications, Medtronic said.   Michael Weinstein, an analyst with JP Morgan, said in a research note that the transactions are expected to be neutral to fiscal years 2012 and 2013 earnings per share, excluding one-time items, and add to earnings thereafter.   However, he added, “getting to neutral in fiscal year 2012 requires by our math significant upfront synergies. Therefore, we wouldn’t be surprised to see the deals end up at least in fiscal year 2012 1 cent to 2 cents dilutive.”   “We expect Medtronic to remain an active acquirer going forward, as it looks to supplement flagging growth in its core CRM (cardiac rhythm management) and Spine businesses,” he wrote.   He said the deals are a “solid strategic fit” and are too small to move the needle in the near-term, but “they bolster the company’s presence in the rapidly growing surgical technology arena,” he said.   Derrick Sung, an analyst with Bernstein Research, noted that combined, both companies are seeing sales growth of about 30 percent and both sell products in the attractive $2 billion-plus advanced energy surgical products market.   Medtronic shares were up 18 cents to $38.26 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, tracking a rally in the broad market.

3,MDT,Medtronic warns of battery issue in some drug pumps,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc has sent a letter to physicians warning about possible reduced battery performance in a small percentage of its SynchroMed II Implantable Drug Infusion Pumps, the medical device maker said on Friday.  As of May 31, there were 55 confirmed cases of the issue from some 139,653 SynchroMed II pump implants worldwide. The battery issue does not include Medtronic’s external insulin pumps for diabetes.  The medical device maker issued its first warning on the pumps, typically used to administer pain medication, in July 2009. At that time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified the action as a class II recall, not the most serious type of recall, but one that might cause temporary health problems or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature.  A spokeswoman for Medtronic said the company currently is working with the FDA on design changes to address the problem.  In April 2010, the FDA said it was placing a renewed focus on preventing problems associated with infusion pumps, widely used devices that deliver fluids, such as medication and nutrients, into the body through a built-in software interface. At that time, the FDA said there appeared to be deficiencies in device design and engineering,  The company, which makes a wide range of heart, neurological and spinal devices, said it is not recalling the product, nor is it recommending surgical removal of the devices unless a patient’s pump demonstrates reduced battery performance.  The company said its analysis indicates that the problem is related to the formation of a film within the pump battery that may affect battery performance. This can lead to the sudden loss of therapy and the return of underlying symptoms and/or withdrawal symptoms, Medtronic said.  Patients with severe spasticity who receive baclofen inside the spine through the infusion pump are at risk of baclofen withdrawal syndrome, which can lead to a life-threatening condition if left untreated. Baclofen is a muscle relaxer and an antispastic agent.  Medtronic said it encourages patients to carry their patient identification cards with them at all times and to contact their physicians immediately if they experience a return of symptoms or hear a device alarm.  It said it is working to obtain U.S. approval for a battery design change intended to prevent the issue from occurring in future pumps. The design change has been implemented in several regions, including Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Africa and India.

5,MDT,"Doctors overuse heart treatment, despite guidelines","NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The controversial use of stents days after a heart attack has continued unabated in the United States, even after a landmark study and new guidelines said the pricey therapy does not help patients.  Just over half of patients who have survived at least 24 hours after a heart attack will have a stent — a small metal mesh tube — placed to open a blocked coronary artery, and that rate has not changed from 2005 through 2008.  The findings add to concerns about overuse of the heart devices, made by companies such as Boston Scientific, Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic Inc and Johnson & Johnson.  Stenting procedures cost the United States about $12 billion every year, and researchers say it is time doctors take responsibility for the nation’s spiraling health costs.  “I think physicians have to rise to the challenge,” said Dr. Judith Hochman, a cardiologist at New York University, who led the new work.  In 2006, Hochman published a study known as the Occluded Artery Trial showing that stents did not prevent any deaths or new heart attacks compared with drugs alone when inserted more than 24 hours after a heart attack into a totally blocked artery.  While the people who got stents did not experience any more side effects, the devices did rack up an extra $7,000 in net cost per person after two years, Hochman later found.  “After a day or so, whatever damage is going to be done was done already,” she told Reuters Health. “The message is to seek medical care soon after a heart attack, and that is when stenting really helps.”  Hochman’s results became part of revised guidelines from the American Heart Association and other groups in 2007, which recommend against using stents more than 24 hours after a heart attack in stable patients.  Her new study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine (bit.ly/7qXyI), is based on nearly 29,000 patients seen at 896 U.S. hospitals.  It shows that neither the 2006 trial nor the revised guidelines had a noticeable effect on stent use.  “Overall there was no change in practice,” Hochman said. “I expected to see a change, so it was a big surprise and a disappointment.”  Hochman’s findings apply to about 100,000 Americans a year, suggesting that about 50,000 people are having the $20,000 procedure done unnecessarily every year.  That is in addition to thousands of stents inserted outside the context of emergencies such as a heart attack, according to a study from last week showing at least one in 12 of those procedures probably leads to more harm than benefit.  Each year in the United States, about 600,000 stents are inserted into ailing hearts where they prop open blocked arteries.  The stenting procedure, called percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, carries risks of complications like major bleeding or tears in the heart. After leaving the hospital, people also need to take clot-busting medications, which further increase the chance of bleeds.  Studies have found that many doctors rush to do PCI before using medications that might help stable patients just as well.  In an editorial, Dr. Mauro Moscucci of the University of Miami said Hochman’s study had inadequate information about the severity of heart attacks, which might have justified the use of stenting in some cases.  Still, he said, it would have been reasonable to expect a reduction in the frequency of late stenting.  “While the debate on health care reform is ongoing, health care expenditures in the United States are continuing to escalate,” Moscucci said.  “Thus we must heed the call to professional responsibility aimed at the elimination of tests and treatments that do not result in any benefit for our patients, and for which the net effect will be added costs, waste, and possible harm.”  Another study in the same journal, published Monday along with Hochman’s report, shows it is not uncommon to see new and better research challenge established conventions and treatments.  In that study, as many as 16 of the reports that appeared in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine, a leading medical publication, contradicted current practice.  But according to Hochman, getting doctors to drop a new treatment may be harder than getting them to take it up — whether that’s due to strongly held beliefs about its effectiveness, worries about medical liability or losing money, or patient expectations.  “We need a lot of changes in the system to control cost and this is just one example,” she said.

7,MDT,UPDATE 3-Rebounding J&J; drugs seen as new growth driver," * Q2 EPS $1.28/share tops $1.24/share forecast   * Q2 sales rise 8.3 pct to $16.6 bln, above forecast   * Weak dollar, lower taxes bolster results   * Company sticks to 2012 view, despite Q2 profit beat   * Shares fall about 1 pct in afternoon trading  (Adds CEO, analyst comments, details on results)   By Ransdell Pierson   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - An emerging turnaround for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) prescription drugs will likely accelerate company sales growth for the rest of the year and bolster earnings over the long term, company officials said after J&J reported better-than-expected quarterly results.   “Their pharmaceuticals business is really starting to take off after the launch a whole host of new drugs that are getting a lot of traction,” Gabelli & Co analyst Jeff Jonas said. “The business is now in a very much better position than any of its peers.”   The drug division has been the company’s Achilles heel in recent years, dragging down results due to generic competition for schizophrenia treatment Risperdal and the anticonvulsant Topamax. But it is on the rebound thanks to strong sales growth of other medicines, including arthritis treatment Remicade, and demand for newer treatments for arthritis, psoriasis, prostate cancer and blood clots.   Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG NOVN.VX also released forecast-beating second-quarter sales on Tuesday, helped by its own new products. Its shares rose 3 percent.   J&J, whose earnings beat was largely due to lower taxes and the weak dollar, fell 1 percent in afternoon trading.   Company results also reflected stabilizing sales of over-the-counter medicines that have been repeatedly recalled in the past two years.   It was the first time the consumer medicines have scored sales gains since early 2010. Many of J&J’s best-known brands, including Tylenol and Motrin painkillers and Rolaids antacid, have been frequently recalled since late 2009 due to quality-control lapses at three plants in the United States and Puerto Rico.   Global sales of J&J prescription drugs jumped 12.2 percent to $6.23 billion in the quarter. Sales of consumer products, including over-the-counter drugs, rose 4 percent to $3.79 billion.   Although prescription drugs dominated the earnings report and will drive future company growth, analysts said the company’s medical device business will likely limp along due to the still-weak global economy.   J&J earned $2.78 billion, or $1.00 per share, compared with $3.45 billion, or $1.23 per share, in the year-earlier period.   Excluding special items, it earned $1.28 per share — topping the average forecast of $1.24 per share among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Company sales jumped 8.3 percent to $16.6 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations of $16.23 billion. They would have risen only 2.6 percent if not for the weaker dollar.   Despite the profit and sales beats in the quarter, J&J stuck to its full-year profit view of $4.90 to $5 per share. That would reflect growth of up to 5 percent from last year’s results.   Company Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said the company was taking a cautious forecasting approach, despite hopes for accelerating sales growth.   “There’s still a sort of uncertainty that overhangs market growth,” he told analysts in a conference call, noting many patients have held back on purchases and elective surgical procedures because of economic conditions.   J&J’s other major business, medical devices and diagnostics, saw sales rise 7.2 percent to $6.57 billion, mostly because of the weaker dollar. Higher demand for surgical-care products, diabetes-care brands and contact lenses offset lower sales of J&J’s stents used to prop open heart arteries that have been cleared of plaque.   J&J said last month it will stop selling drug-coated heart stents, a former profit driver for the company that has stumbled due to safety concerns and fierce competition.   It said it would end development of its Nevo heart stent and stop making its Cypher stent, ceding the field to Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Medtronic Inc (MDT.N). J&J will continue, however, to sell its far less-lucrative bare metal stents.   J&J shares were down 55 cents at $66.54 in afternoon trading.

9,MDT,"St Jude posts lower earnings, but shares rise","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Heart device maker St Jude Medical Inc STJ.N posted lower quarterly earnings and cut its 2011 forecast, but its shares moved higher on relief the outlook was not worse and on continued dialogue with regulators over a key new product.  St Jude shares were up 1.9 percent to $47.71 in early afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, even as the broad stock market slipped. Analysts, who had been expecting the company to cut its estimates for weeks, were relieved St Jude had finally communicated the revision.  “The reduction of estimates was an overhang that is now removed,” said analyst Tao Levy of Collins Stewart.  The shares were also supported by comments from executives who said talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were ongoing about the approval of one of its highly anticipated heart rhythm management products that has a quadripolar lead.  St Jude had previously said it expected to launch the new product by mid-2011. Today, executives said they expected approval by the beginning of the fourth quarter.  “Comments around Quadrapole was positive in the sense that it suggests that the dialogue with FDA is progressing in the right direction and not derailed,” Levy said.  For 2011, the company lowered its outlook to $3.25 to $3.30 per share from the previous outlook of $3.28 $3.33 per share, citing weakness in the market for products that treat heart rhythm disorders, such as implantable defibrillators and pacemakers, and the delay in getting the quadripolar device approved.  “We wish the CRM (cardiac rhythm management) market was more predictable. It sure as heck hasn’t been ... It seems to be the nature of the beast no matter how much attention we give to it,” Chief Executive Dan Starks said on a conference call, adding that he expected the market to remain unpredictable.  “We work to err on the side of being conservative” with respect to earnings forecasts, he said.  Weakness in the CRM division was offset by strength in other product lines and that was likely to continue as the St Jude remains focused on diversifying its product offerings, said Chief Financial Officer John Heinmiller in an interview.  The maker of heart pacemakers and valves said it expected net earnings for the third quarter to be 74 cents to 76 cents.  According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the average estimate on Wall Street was for third-quarter earnings to be 80 cents.  Its second-quarter net earnings were $240.9 million, or 72 cents a share, compared with $254.0 million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding after-tax charges of 13 cents per share, adjusted earnings rose to 85 cents, which was a penny higher than the average estimate on Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Second-quarter sales rose to $1.45 billion from $1.31 billion.  U.S. sales fell 2 percent in the quarter, driven by weakness in the CRM market, however, international sales jumped 23 percent and now represents the majority of its business.  Starks told the conference call that the company’s outlook assumes the global market for CRM products will contract 2 percent in 2011, which puts the total market at $11.4 billion, rather than $11.9 billion it had assumed earlier this year.  St Jude holds a 26 percent to 27 percent share of that market, so the contraction will reduce revenue by $130 million to $135 million, Starks said.  But, he added, the company still sees “the CRM market glass as half full not half empty,” citing “vulnerable competitors.” Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) are St Jude’s main competitors.  “We took (market) share in 2010 and expect to do it again in 2011 and 2012,” Starks said.  Heinmiller said St Jude has taken 7 points of market share in the CRM market over the past five years. In an average year, he said, St Jude has taken 1.25 points of market share, even in years with few new product launches.  In the latest quarter, the company reported total cardiac rhythm management sales, which include implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemaker products, were $793 million, a 1 percent increase over a year ago. It grew 3 percent from a year ago after adjusting for the one-time benefit of a Boston Scientific’s suspension of ICD sales in the United States in the 2010 period.  Of that total, ICD sales were $477 million in the second quarter, up 1 percent over last year. Second-quarter pacemaker sales were $316 million, flat from a year ago.

10,MDT,"UPDATE 3-St Jude posts lower earnings, but shares rise"," * Shares up 1.9 pct despite results, revision   * Analyst cites investor relief, ongoing FDA talks   * CEO Starks: company conservative re earnings forecasts  (Rewrites with CFO interview, analyst comments; adds byline and updates stock price)   By Debra Sherman   CHICAGO, July 20 (Reuters) - Heart device maker St Jude Medical Inc STJ.N posted lower quarterly earnings and cut its 2011 forecast, but its shares moved higher on relief the outlook was not worse and on continued dialogue with regulators over a key new product.   St Jude shares were up 1.9 percent to $47.71 in early afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, even as the broad stock market slipped. Analysts, who had been expecting the company to cut its estimates for weeks, were relieved St Jude had finally communicated the revision.   “The reduction of estimates was an overhang that is now removed,” said analyst Tao Levy of Collins Stewart.   The shares were also supported by comments from executives who said talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were ongoing about the approval of one of its highly anticipated heart rhythm management products that has a quadripolar lead.   St Jude had previously said it expected to launch the new product by mid-2011. Today, executives said they expected approval by the beginning of the fourth quarter.   “Comments around Quadrapole was positive in the sense that it suggests that the dialogue with FDA is progressing in the right direction and not derailed,” Levy said.   For 2011, the company lowered its outlook to $3.25 to $3.30 per share from the previous outlook of $3.28 $3.33 per share, citing weakness in the market for products that treat heart rhythm disorders, such as implantable defibrillators and pacemakers, and the delay in getting the quadripolar device approved.   “We wish the CRM (cardiac rhythm management) market was more predictable. It sure as heck hasn’t been ... It seems to be the nature of the beast no matter how much attention we give to it,” Chief Executive Dan Starks said on a conference call, adding that he expected the market to remain unpredictable.   “We work to err on the side of being conservative” with respect to earnings forecasts, he said.   Weakness in the CRM division was offset by strength in other product lines and that was likely to continue as the St Jude remains focused on diversifying its product offerings, said Chief Financial Officer John Heinmiller in an interview.   The maker of heart pacemakers and valves said it expected net earnings for the third quarter to be 74 cents to 76 cents.   According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the average estimate on Wall Street was for third-quarter earnings to be 80 cents.   Its second-quarter net earnings were $240.9 million, or 72 cents a share, compared with $254.0 million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding after-tax charges of 13 cents per share, adjusted earnings rose to 85 cents, which was a penny higher than the average estimate on Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

11,MDT,UPDATE 2-US FDA panel OKs Edwards heart valve despite risks," * Panel votes 9-0 with one abstention in favor of valve   * Replacement valve an alternative for open-heart surgery  (New throughout)   By Alina Selyukh   GAITHERSBURG, Md., July 20 (Reuters) - Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s (EW.N) heart valve for patients deemed too sick to have open-heart surgery was approved by a U.S. Food and Drug  Administration advisory panel on Wednesday, despite concerns that it could increase the risk of stroke.   After deliberating on trial statistics and labeling for the device, the panel voted 9-0 with one abstention in favor of the valve, now set to become the first transcatheter aortic valve sold in the United States.   The replacement valve increased the survival rate for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis to 69.3 percent in a trial examined by the panel, compared with 50.3 percent in those treated with other therapies.   Patients with the valve also had a 3.1 times higher rate of developing neurological problems, particularly stroke, which became the biggest point of contention at the panel hearing.   In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve that allows blood to leave the heart does not fully open, decreasing blood flow and potentially preventing it from reaching the brain and the rest of the body.   “When I see patients in their 80s or older and they have debilitating valve disease ... their greatest fear is a stroke, becoming dependent,” said Dr. Jeffrey Borer, a panel member and cardiovascular medicine chief at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center. “I think stroke is a very major issue, and I think it’s worse than death,” he said.   Dr. Augusto Pichard, a principal investigator for the Edwards Sapien valve trial at the Washington Hospital Center, said that although vascular complications had declined during the trial, the causes of a 7.3 percent stroke rate in the first month and 10.6 percent rate in the first year were unclear.   “We need to learn where it comes from and how to predict it because at this point we don’t know,” said Pichard, who spoke to the panel on behalf of the Society for Cardiac Angiography and Interventions. He called the approval a “saving grace” for people with severe aortic stenosis.   A bad aortic valve commonly requires open-heart surgery, during which the ribs are sawed open, the heart is stopped and a new valve is sewn in place. With an Edwards’ Sapien transcatheter heart valve, a catheter guides the new valve to the heart through the femoral artery in the groin or a small incision between the ribs.   Edwards has sold such a valve in Europe since 2007 and, given FDA approval, it plans to launch its valve in the United States in October. The FDA usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels.   The device is expected to cost about $30,000, and will compete with a system developed by Medtronic Inc’s (MDT.N) CoreValve unit in Europe.   The panel raised questions about the risks of wider use of the Edwards valve, including the likelihood of surgeons implanting that valve into an already-implanted valve, which has not been tested in the United States.   The panel also debated the definition of “inoperable” patients, concerned that surgeons would expand the technique beyond the target group of generally elderly and very sick people concerned more with quality of life than length of life.   John Somberg, professor of medicine and pharmacology at Rush University, was the one panel member who abstained from voting on the device’s benefits outweighing the risks. He said he had planned to vote favorably, but that the data had not been presented coherently at the panel.   At the hearing, Edwards’ researchers presented raw data that had not been included in the study originally submitted to the FDA, showing that mortality and stroke rates may rise after two or more years.   “We are concerned about strokes, and we absolutely need to do some more work in this area, but it’s also really hard to have a stroke if you’re dead,” said Elizabeth Patrick-Lake, chief executive of PFO Research Foundation and the patient representative on the panel.   The panel voted 9-1 that the device was effective, and 7-3 that it was safe for the target patient group who are considered high-risk or non-operable for conventional open-heart surgery.   Edwards shares fell 2.4 percent to $87.53 on Wednesday.

12,MDT,PREVIEW-Report could sway U.S. FDA device review process," * Institute of Medicine report due out Friday   * FDA requested medical device unit review   * Changes to accelerated approval process a top issue   By Andrew Seaman   WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - The Institute of Medicine is poised to advise the U.S. drug regulator how it can refine its medical device approval process to get products to market quickly while protecting patients.   The Food and Drug Administration requested the IOM report as part of Commissioner Margaret Hamburg’s vow to improve the FDA’s device unit, an area dogged by high staff turnover and funding woes.   Friday’s report by the influential nonprofit organization is expected to address some of the more contentious changes proposed by FDA to the accelerated device approval process, known as the 510(k) program.   Critics say the accelerated 510(k) process is too widely used and leads to inadequate testing for some risky devices, but it is defended by industry as necessary to speed technologies to patients.   Nearly a year ago the FDA proposed changes to the program, including the possibility of creating a new category of more risky devices that would require more data to win approval.   This new category is among the issues the IOM report is expected to address.   “Potentially it could have a big impact on how things will be changed,” said Dr. Gregory Curfman, executive editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, of the IOM’s report.   Medical devices range from simple bandages to complex implants such as pacemakers, stents and artificial knees. The largest medical-device makers include Medtronic Inc (MDT.N), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N).   The 510(k) program allows medical devices to get to market faster if they are “substantially equivalent” to an existing product. Critics say this can allow unsafe products to reach the market. Most new medical devices — about 3,000 each year — are cleared through the program.   High-profile incidents include a massive recall last year of artificial hips by Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy unit. Some 93,000 patients worldwide had that line of hip implant. [ID:nN26186681]   Some health policy organizations were critical of the FDA for not moving sooner to make changes to the device approval process.   “Let me say that the whole process is illogical, because the FDA knows best what they need to do,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families. “And in some kind of ideal world the FDA would have come out with these proposals and implemented them.”   Hamburg said on Monday that the agency should do more work to explain the approval process, especially to small device manufacturers.   “I think there’s a lot to be done,” she said in a speech at the office of Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group. “I think the FDA has a responsibility to take a serious look at how we’re organized to do business.”  (Reporting by Andrew Seaman with additional reporting by Anna Yukhananov; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)  ",7252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-fda-devices/preview-report-could-sway-u-s-fda-device-review-process-idUSN1E76L0SS20110725

14,MDT,U.S. advisers call for new medical device regime,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An advisory group said the U.S. fast-track approval process for medical devices is fatally flawed and should be replaced, but the Food and Drug Administration said the recommendation was a non-starter.  The FDA had asked for the Institute of Medicine report as part of a broad agency review of its device unit, an area dogged by high staff turnover, funding woes and major recalls in recent year of devices ranging from artificial hips to heart defibrillators.  The IOM found the fast-track approval process, called 510(k), does not adequately protect patients and recommended a more thorough approval process likely to raise the costs for device makers with pre-market and post-market device reviews.  “What we are recommending is that the 510(k) is fatally flawed in terms of it not evaluating safety and effectiveness of a device,” said Dr. David Challoner, chairman of the IOM’s committee.  But the finding was swiftly rejected by the FDA’s top device official.  “FDA believes that the 510(k) process should not be eliminated, but we are open to additional proposals and approaches for continued improvement of our device review programs,” Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.

Most new medical devices — about 4,000 in 2009 — are cleared through the accelerated program.  The FDA has proposed changes, including the possibility of creating a new category of more risky devices that would require more data to win approval.  But the IOM committee said the FDA should not waste its limited resources on changing the current program. Instead, the committee said the FDA should focus on developing a new framework.  High-profile incidents include a massive recall last year of artificial hips by Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy unit. Some 93,000 patients worldwide had that line of hip implant.  Automated external defibrillators, used in public places such as airports to revive cardiac arrest victims, have also made up a significant portion of 510(k) recalls in recent years. Health officials are looking at thousands of reports of malfunctions which may have led to patient harm or death.  Medical devices range from simple bandages to complex implants such as pacemakers, stents and artificial knees. Other than Johnson & Johnson, the largest medical-device makers include Medtronic Inc, Boston Scientific Corp and Abbott Laboratories Inc.  The IOM suggested the FDA start collecting information to build the new process, including post-market data for devices. Congress should then enact legislation to design the regulatory framework, according to the report.  “A new system needs to be put in place that will be more effective especially in post-market surveillance,” said Challoner.

The FDA has proposed changes, including the possibility of creating a new category of more risky devices that would require more data to win approval.   But the IOM committee said the FDA should not waste its limited resources on changing the current program. Instead, the committee said the FDA should focus on developing a new framework.   High-profile incidents include a massive recall last year of artificial hips by Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) DePuy unit. Some 93,000 patients worldwide had that line of hip implant. [ID:nN26186681]   Automated external defibrillators, used in public places such as airports to revive cardiac arrest victims, have also made up a significant portion of 510(k) recalls in recent years. Health officials are looking at thousands of reports of malfunctions which may have led to patient harm or death. [ID:nN15265576]   Medical devices range from simple bandages to complex implants such as pacemakers, stents and artificial knees. Other than Johnson & Johnson, the largest medical-device makers include Medtronic Inc (MDT.N), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N).   The IOM suggested the FDA start collecting information to build the new process, including post-market data for devices. Congress should then enact legislation to design the regulatory framework, according to the report.   “A new system needs to be put in place that will be more effective especially in post-market surveillance,” said Challoner.

18,MDT,Healthcare stocks hammered on debt-ceiling pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Healthcare stocks sold off sharply on Monday on fears that the debt-ceiling deal to be voted on by the U.S. Congress would lead to cuts in healthcare spending for the Medicare program for the elderly.  Hospitals and other healthcare service providers that rely on Medicare reimbursement sustained losses of well over 10 percent, with HCA Holdings Inc and Gentiva Health Services among them. Health insurers also tumbled, with the largest, UnitedHealth Group Inc, down as much as 8 percent at one point.  Companies that run skilled nursing facilities were the biggest losers overall, as they also were hit with targeted reimbursement cuts from the agency that oversees Medicare. Skilled Healthcare fell over 40 percent, for example.  While Monday’s sell-off centered on the fallout from the debt-ceiling deal, the rising cost of healthcare has long been an issue for governments around the world, made worse by recent economic crises that have reduced tax revenues.  With the U.S. government borrowing about 40 cents for every dollar it spends, attempts to reduce soaring healthcare costs are only likely to increase over the next few years.  “The health care sector had done well because of the burgeoning population of the baby boomers,” said Marc Pado, a U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in San Francisco. “It had been a gold pin factor that had been pushing a lot of the health care stocks up. But this is definitely a blow that sets them back.”  Shares of drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc and medical device manufacturers such as Medtronic Inc also fell up to 2.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, on Monday.  According to the deal reached in Congress, a bipartisan committee is set to find a further $1.5 trillion in savings, beyond an initial $900 billion.  If the committee cannot agree on at least $1.2 trillion in savings, automatic cuts kick in starting in 2013. Medicare would face cuts under this scenario.  “There’s a lot of uncertainty about the Super Commission and the Medicare cuts, which is why everything is cratering,” said Ipsita Smolinski, analyst at Capitol Street in Washington. “People didn’t think Medicare would be included (in the cuts). And now they’re trying to absorb that... plans and providers could get cut in the second round.”  The prospect of government cuts, coupled with the lack of clarity over their extent, struck analysts as similar to the uncertainty wrought by the U.S. healthcare reform law debates that whipsawed the sector for more than a year before a bill passed in 2010.  “There’s this completely pessimistic view at the moment from portfolio managers all over the Street about reimbursement visibility and the outlook for every single healthcare segment,” Jefferies & Co analyst Arthur Henderson said. “You’ve got emotional selling going on here.”  The debt-ceiling impact was compounded by Friday’s announcement by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that it would cut payments to skilled nursing facilities by 11 percent.  “This is essentially the worst-case scenario,” Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gurda said in a research note. “This cut will wipe out a significant portion of their earnings, and will also likely cause debt covenants to be broken.”  Investors feared the skilled nursing cuts would be a harbinger of broader cuts to come, said Tim Nelson, a senior healthcare analyst with Nuveen Asset Management.  “The whole sector is down,” he said. “People are just afraid that healthcare will be in the crosshairs of this new committee.”  Oppenheimer & Co analyst Michael Wiederhorn said significant cuts to all providers, including hospitals and home health companies, seemed likely.  “With the open-ended nature of this legislation, and the potential for large cuts to healthcare spending, we believe healthcare services will be one of the losers,” Wiederhorn said in a research note.  Still, some analysts called the sell-off a knee-jerk reaction and saw buying opportunities among some of the beaten-down shares.  “It’s not a doomsday scenario,” said Newton Juhng, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. “It’s a tough day, and you are losing some investors who are choosing not to remain in the space. But longer term, the volume trends are still there.”  Jefferies’ Henderson cited dialysis company Davita Inc, which was off 4 percent, and pharmacy benefit managers, which include Express Scripts Inc, among the oversold stocks.  “What you have today is everyone saying, ‘Everything is on the table, so we’re clearing out,’ “ Henderson said.

21,MDT,UPDATE 1-Medtronic hires Yale experts for spine drug review,"   * To pay Yale $2.5 mln to lead review on Infuse product	   * Yale to commission two separate reviews	   * Goal is to gain credibility and make data accessible	   	  (Adds comment from The Spine Journal)	   By Debra Sherman	   CHICAGO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - In a bid to clear its name, Medtronic Inc is hiring top researchers at Yale University to review data on a spine surgery product that became suspect over potential conflicts of interest.	   The world’s largest medical device maker came under fire in June, when an article in The Spine Journal said that doctors paid by Medtronic had failed to report serious complications from its bone growth product Infuse.	   Fifteen of the surgeons involved in reporting the drug’s effects had reportedly received at least $62 million in the past decade. 	   The company is the subject of a U.S. Senate probe over the allegations.	   Now it is paying researchers at Yale $2.5 million to conduct two systematic reviews of its data on Infuse, Medtronic said on Wednesday.	   “Those (Spine Journal) articles created more confusion and raised questions about patient safety. We would like clarity on safety and efficacy of the product and bring a clear understanding that Medtronic is willing to do whatever it takes,” Christopher O’Connell, president of Medtronic’s Restorative Therapies Group, said in a telephone interview.	   Infuse is a synthetic bone growth product often used as a bone graft substitute in spine fusions. It generated sales of about $750 million in fiscal 2011, according to Wells Fargo, and Wall Street analysts expect that revenue to decline due to the questions about its risks.	   In articles published in The Spine Journal, the official journal of the North American Spine Society, a group of doctors called the industry-sponsored research biased and misleading that grossly underestimated the risks.	   They said complications like cancer, sterility, infections and bone dissolution occurred in 10 to 50 percent of patients who received Infuse or a sister product in 13 clinical trials funded by Medtronic, but were not reported in research papers.	   The Yale review will be headed by Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a highly regarded cardiologist. Krumholz will be paid by Medtronic and serve as an intermediary, choosing experts who will evaluate the data.	   A steering committee of medical experts and patients appointed by Yale will be led by Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, Chair of the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health.	   “This is an opportunity to change standards,” Krumholz told Reuters. “The money has got to come from industry because no one else is going to step up. So how do you create a model that is fair to the company and that also serves the public?	   “The two groups will work independently to answer the same questions: What’s the quality of the data and what can you infer about the benefits and harms,” Krumholz said. “That’s pretty hard to rig.”	   Krumholz said Medtronic is the first company to agree to release all of its data — published and unpublished — on about 800 patient records.	   The Yale review “appears to be a big first step in the right direction,” Dr. Eugene Carragee, Editor-in-Chief of The Spine Journal, said in a prepared statement.	   However, the findings may still be invalid since a subsequent analysis of original flawed data, such as in some of the industry-sponsored Infuse studies, will have little value.	   “Unfortunately, the Yale University researchers will not be able to fix the study design flaws and assessment biases that were used in some of the original studies,” he noted.	   In addition, because the original Medtronic-sponsored research did not report any adverse events, the voluntary reporting by practicing surgeons was handicapped by surgeons and patients not recognizing many of the complications were related to the product, he said.	   Finally, the most common use of Infuse today is posterior lumbar fusions and the randomized trial on this particular use was halted early on because of complications and adverse events, he noted.	   “Consequently, the Yale group will still have very little controlled data to judge actual safety of the product,” Carragee concluded.	   The reviews are expected to be completed in six months and available to the public in 18 months.

23,MDT,Medtronic investors look for new CEO's plan,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s new chief executive, Omar Ishrak, will be pressed for details on his plan to revive the world’s largest medical device maker when the company releases first-quarter results next week.  Ishrak, who took the helm in June after leading General Electric Co’s Healthcare unit, may consider everything from paring back profit forecasts to divesting units, Wall Street analysts say.  His actions will serve as a response to the flagging sales and pricing pressure Medtronic has seen in its biggest markets for heart rhythm and spinal devices as healthcare providers and insurers try to rein in costs. Medical studies suggesting that some of its implants are overprescribed have also hurt sales.  “Everyone has some expectations that we get to that event and start to get some details about his thoughts on the company and where things can improve,” said David Heupel, senior portfolio manager at Thrivent Investment Management.  Investors want to know what Medtronic’s size and shape will look like going forward, what its focus will be, and how it will use its cash, said Heupel, who views Medtronic stock as inexpensive but lacking growth drivers. He does not own it.  “The stock for the last decade has really not done anything, and this was a firm that created a number of millionaires, from its shareholders to its employees,” Heupel said. “There has been some criticism of management in the past, for the deals they’ve done and the hesitance to be more aggressive on expenses.”  Medtronic forecast earnings of $3.43 to $3.50 per share on revenue growth of 1 to 3 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, for fiscal 2012, which began in May. Some analysts believe even that modest goal is optimistic.  For the first quarter, analysts on average expect Medtronic to earn 79 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Company shares slumped to a year low in early August, and are off 12.5 percent this year, compared with a 5.2 percent drop for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  “We cannot rule out that Ishrak reduces fiscal-year 2012 guidance,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Charles Chon.  The selection of Ishrak to replace the retiring Bill Hawkins won praise from analysts who viewed the choice of a company outsider as a first step in improving the business.  Medtronic has stepped up the pace of acquisitions in recent years, incorporating promising technologies such as heart valves but also some underperforming products such as a treatment for fractures of the vertebrae known as kyphoplasty.  “They are rebuilding their product pipeline, but it’s just such a big ship. It will take a long time to turn,” said Jeff Jonas, co-portfolio manager of the Gabelli Healthcare and Wellness Trust, which does not own Medtronic shares.  Some investors and analysts would like to see Ishrak take a harder look at the expense side of the business.  Jonas believes the new CEO will accelerate cost cutting and keep a focus on international expansion.  “They’ve done a lot of layoffs already. They are doing plant optimization and trying to design these things to be cheaper and easier to manufacture. I think he sticks with the current plan and tries to go faster,” Jonas said.  He would also prefer a more attractive dividend yield and stock buybacks. “It’s something I’d like to see them be a lot more aggressive on,” Jonas said.  Some analysts have also suggested Medtronic could spin off its struggling spine business, the subject of a Senate probe over accusations that doctors in its hire downplayed the risks of its Infuse bone growth drug in clinical trials. Medtronic has since announced that Yale University researchers will independently review the data.  Jonas said the spine unit may be too big to sell, and he doubts it will be spun off either.  “They are stuck with it. It’s not an attractive market to buy into in a big way, and it wouldn’t get a lot of respect as a stand-alone company in the market. I really think they have to ride it out,” he said.  Goldman Sachs analyst David Roman is not so sure.  “Medtronic has a good collection of assets that could be managed better, from breaking up the company at one extreme to restructuring. There’s lots they can do to make better use of the assets they have,” Roman said.  Ishrak has a clean slate to remake the company.  “For the patient investor, there is the potential for a lot of upside here. What is absolutely critical is that he comes out and acknowledges to the public and investors that the status quo is not working,” Roman said.

25,MDT,National Institutes of Health revises conflict of interest rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Institutes of Health revised on Tuesday its 16-year-old conflict of interest rules for medical researchers, lowering the amount of money that constitutes a financial conflict and expanding the required disclosures.  The 1995 regulations effectively put responsibility for tracking scientists’ financial conflicts of interest on their universities. The rule required researchers to disclose conflicts to their institutions, which then had to assure the NIH the conflict had been managed, reduced or eliminated.  The new rule extends that requirement so researchers report not only the fact of a conflict of interest, but also its details such as value, specific nature, why it is a conflict and the impact it might have on research.  It lowers the amount a researcher must disclose if received from an industry or held in company stock to $5,000 from about $10,000.  Research institutions, in turn, are now required to report that information to the federal grant-awarding agency alongside details of how the conflicts are managed. Also, before spending any grant money, the institution has to post information about the financial conflicts on a public website.  The new rules will affect about 2,000 organizations that are awarded public health science funding every year and some 38,000 scientists who participate in research funded by these grants and have a “significant financial interest,” NIH said.  Concern about the integrity of research in the United States has grown since 2008, when Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley criticized prominent Harvard University psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Biederman and others for failing to fully disclose payments from drug companies.  In a more recent example, medical device maker Medtronic Inc came under fire over accusations that doctors paid by the company had failed to disclose major side effects from a bone growth drug in clinical trials.  A 2009 report by the Institute of Medicine, one of the National Academies of Sciences that advises U.S. policymakers, called on doctors to strictly disclose research funding to strengthen protection against conflicts of interest. The report called for virtually anyone involved in medicine — academic medical centers, journals, professional societies, researchers and doctors — to set up or strengthen conflict of interest guidelines.  From 1996 to 2007, relationships between individual academic researchers and industry nearly doubled, according to a study cited by NIH in its final rule.

26,MDT,US health agency revises conflict of interest rules," * Revised 1995 rule to expand scope, lower threshold   * Financial conflicts of scientists in focus since 2008   * From 1996 to 2003, financial support almost tripled   By Alina Selyukh   WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Institutes of Health revised on Tuesday its 16-year-old conflict of interest rules for medical researchers, lowering the amount of money that constitutes a financial conflict and expanding the required disclosures.   The 1995 regulations effectively put responsibility for tracking scientists’ financial conflicts of interest on their universities. The rule required researchers to disclose conflicts to their institutions, which then had to assure the NIH the conflict had been managed, reduced or eliminated.   The new rule extends that requirement so researchers report not only the fact of a conflict of interest, but also its details such as value, specific nature, why it is a conflict and the impact it might have on research.   It lowers the amount a researcher must disclose if received from an industry or held in company stock to $5,000 from about $10,000.   Research institutions, in turn, are now required to report that information to the federal grant-awarding agency alongside details of how the conflicts are managed. Also, before spending any grant money, the institution has to post information about the financial conflicts on a public website.   The new rules will affect about 2,000 organizations that are awarded public health science funding every year and some 38,000 scientists who participate in research funded by these grants and have a “significant financial interest,” NIH said.   Concern about the integrity of research in the United States has grown since 2008, when Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley criticized prominent Harvard University psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Biederman and others for failing to fully disclose payments from drug companies.   In a more recent example, medical device maker Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) came under fire over accusations that doctors paid by the company had failed to disclose major side effects from a bone growth drug in clinical trials.   A 2009 report by the Institute of Medicine, one of the National Academies of Sciences that advises U.S. policymakers, called on doctors to strictly disclose research funding to strengthen protection against conflicts of interest. The report called for virtually anyone involved in medicine — academic medical centers, journals, professional societies, researchers and doctors — to set up or strengthen conflict of interest guidelines.   From 1996 to 2007, relationships between individual academic researchers and industry nearly doubled, according to a study cited by NIH in its final rule. From 1994 to 2003, the amount of financial support for biomedical research almost tripled to $94.3 billion, with 57 percent of that funding coming from industry sources, according to analysis cited by NIH.

27,MDT,"UPDATE 4-New Medtronic CEO seeks R&D; payoff, global growth"," * Ishrak wants efficiency focus, too   * Q1 EPS ex-items 79 cents matches Street view   * Company backs earnings, revenue forecast   * Shares up 4.3 percent  (Adds analyst, further CEO comments)   By Susan Kelly and Lewis Krauskopf   CHICAGO/NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s (MDT.N) new chief executive vowed to further expand internationally and improve returns from the company’s research spending as he seeks to revive growth at the world’s largest medical device maker.   CEO Omar Ishrak, a former General Electric Co (GE.N) executive, also said the company would seek to become more efficient.   He said Medtronic remained committed to returning cash to shareholders, while exploring smaller acquisitions. He plans no major changes for now to the company’s diversified portfolio of medical devices beyond the planned sale or spinoff of the external defibrillator business.   Ishrak’s comments, on the company’s fiscal first-quarter conference call, gave the first glimpse of his strategy since he took the helm in June. Medtronic reported quarterly results that met analysts’ estimates and it backed its fiscal-year revenue and profit views.   Medtronic shares were up 4.3 percent to $32.52 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, reflecting relief the results were better than some had feared and optimism that the new CEO had struck the right note on the conference call.   “From the point of view of setting the stage, I think he did a pretty good job,” said Morgan Keegan & Co analyst Jan Wald. “He came across as sort of a tough guy, one who is going to be relentless in his pursuit of data and execution. Medtronic has been ‘Minnesota nice.’ This may be a little bit of a different environment for them.”   Medtronic is struggling with weak demand and pricing in its important markets for heart defibrillators and spine products.   Factors include the weak economy, a study suggesting heart devices are improperly used in too-sick patients, and allegations in a medical journal that researchers hid serious complications with the company’s Infuse bone growth product. Ishrak said the fallout from those problems will persist.   “While we expect our ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillators) and spinal markets will be under pressure this year, we do expect the rest of our portfolio to continue to generate growth,” Ishrak said on the conference call with analysts.   Emerging markets represent 10 percent of revenue, and Ishrak said he believes average annual growth rates of 20 percent are sustainable.   Ishrak said the returns on research and development have been “unsatisfactory” over the years. “This is not acceptable and clearly cannot continue, and will require some major changes,” he said.   Analysts have speculated that Medtronic may sell some of its businesses, but Ishrak said he liked the company’s diversified model for now.   “I see a reason for these businesses to be a part of Medtronic. We serve our customers well because of our diversification,” Ishrak said in an interview.   He also plans no management shakeup.   “I’m very impressed by the talent at Medtronic. They have to adjust to this culture change, and I have every indication that they will,” Ishrak told Reuters.   Net income in Medtronic’s fiscal first quarter that ended July 29 was $821 million, or 77 cents a share, compared with $830 million, or 76 cents a share, a year ago.   Excluding special items, earnings of 79 cents per share matched the average estimate of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   First-quarter revenue rose 7 percent to $4.05 billion, or 2 percent after adjusting for a favorable currency impact. Analysts looked for $3.98 billion.   “No one is having a party for 2 percent revenue growth, but at least it was in line with what people were thinking,” said Jefferies & Co analyst Raj Denhoy.   “It’s been a long several years as far as improving revenue growth, and what investors are looking for is a turn in that top-line performance.”   Revenue for Medtronic’s ICDs fell 8 percent to $697 million. Spinal revenue was unchanged at $825 million. Infuse revenue declined 8 percent in the quarter.   Diabetes revenue grew 14 percent, surgical technologies increased 13 percent, while its cardiovascular unit that includes stents and other products rose 19 percent.   Medtronic still expects fiscal-year earnings in the range of $3.43 to $3.50 per share, including about 4 cents to 6 cents of dilution from an acquisition. Analysts are looking for $3.45 a share.   It also backed its revenue forecast calling for growth in the range of 1 percent to 3 percent on a constant currency basis.   Medtronic shares slumped to a one-year low in early August and are off about 16 percent this year, compared to a decline of about 10 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

The first-quarter report will mark the former General Electric Co Healthcare executive’s first public comments to investors, who hope to gain insight into his ideas for reviving long-term growth at the world’s largest medical device maker.	   Medtronic is struggling with weak demand and pricing in implantable cardioverter defibrillators and spine products, two of its biggest markets. Analysts expect further sales declines for the company’s controversial Infuse bone growth stimulant used in spine surgery following allegations in a medical journal that researchers hid serious complications.	   “Medtronic’s problems are well advertised and, in many ways, it depends on what management plans on doing to address them that will likely make the difference,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch said last week.	   Some analysts expect Medtronic to reduce its full-year outlook, following the lead of rival heart device maker St Jude Medical Inc , which in July cut its full-year earnings outlook due to the persistent weakness in the markets for heart rhythm treatments, which include ICDs and pacemakers.	   For fiscal 2012, Medtronic forecast earnings of $3.43 to $3.50 per share on revenue growth of 1 to 3 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.	   For the first quarter, analysts on average expect Medtronic to earn 79 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   Company shares slumped to a one-year low in early August and are off about 16 percent this year, compared to a decline of about 9 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.	   Analysts’ suggestions for remaking Medtronic range from spinning off the spine business to accelerating cost-cutting initiatives.	   Medtronic is focused on expanding in international markets and has a number of new technologies coming through the pipeline, including less-invasive heart valve implants and a treatment for high blood pressure.	   “There are numerous potential growth drivers in Medtronic’s pipeline, but these may take a few years to have a significant impact on revenue growth,” Mizuho analyst Michael Matson said last week.

32,MDT,Medtronic insulin pumps vulnerable to hackers," * Hackers could gain remote control of pumps, expert says   * Medtronic says risk of attack is ‘extremely low’   * Medtronic to boost security in next-generation devices   By Jim Finkle   BOSTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) acknowledged that security flaws in its line of implanted insulin pumps could allow hackers to remotely take control of the devices that dose insulin to diabetes patients.   But company officials said that the about 200,000 diabetes patients who use those devices need not worry about their safety because the risk of a cyber attack is extremely low.   “This would have to be a premeditated activity by somebody trying to cause harm to an individual,” said John Mastrototaro, a physician who serves as vice president of research and development for Medtronic’s diabetes division. “The likelihood of this accidentally happening is nil.”   The vulnerabilities, which are among the first to be reported in any type of medical device, were originally disclosed at a hacking conference in Las Vegas earlier this month by Jay Radcliffe, a cyber security expert who suffers from diabetes.   Radcliffe claimed that hackers can easily gain control of the devices, saying the devices have wireless communications systems that constantly monitor their surroundings for commands.   He stood on stage in a large conference room and hacked into a pump attached to his body that regularly provides him with carefully measured doses of insulin. The dramatic presentation was one of the talks that generated the most buzz at the annual Black Hat conference.   He originally did not identify Medtronic as the maker of the device, saying he wanted the company to have time to figure out a way to mitigate the vulnerability.   But he disclosed the company’s name on Thursday in a webcast sponsored by the Black Hat security conference, saying that Medtronic had downplayed the risk. He called on the public to pressure Medtronic to take action to make the devices safer, even though he said that the risk to any individual patient was extremely low   “If you are a customer, demand that they take this situation seriously and be truthful,” he said.   Medtronic’s Mastrototaro said that he was taking action and had ordered closer scrutiny of potential security vulnerabilities in the company’s next-generation line of insulin pumps, which are currently in development.   “We have a lot of activities going around on this topic now,” he said.   He said it would be difficult to make changes to pumps already in use because of U.S. FDA regulations that require device makers to get agency approval before changing anything in their products, including issuing software patches.   Medtronic would likely have to recall each pump so that technicians could install the new software and check the equipment to make sure that it was still accurately delivering doses of insulin, he said.   Stuart McClure, a senior vice president with security software maker McAfee, said that the debate over cyber security of medical devices is likely to gain steam as researchers discover vulnerabilities in other types of equipment.   “All devices, including medical devices can be hacked, and companies are foolish if they think their devices are immune,” said McClure.   McAfee this year recruited an elite squad of hackers and charged them with figuring out ways to hack into all types of electronics equipment, including heart pacemakers.   “Generally speaking, we know that there are medical devices with vulnerabilities,” he said. “Companies would be wise to address them, rather than denying they exist.”  (Reporting by Jim Finkle; editing by Carol Bishopric)   ",8262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-security/medtronic-insulin-pumps-vulnerable-to-hackers-idUSN1E77O1VJ20110826
33,MDT,Heart valves and toasters: call for new EU rules," * Cardiologists seek overhaul of EU devices system   * Light-touch framework raises safety concerns   * Gap between European and U.S. medtech regulation    By Ben Hirschler	   PARIS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Pacemakers and electric toasters have little in common, yet in Europe the same regulatory framework covers both and a growing number of doctors think the system is no longer up to the job.	   The issue has come to the fore at this year’s annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), which is calling for an overhaul of Europe’s “CE mark” scheme as far as it affects evaluating and approving new medical technology.	   The push for change in Europe highlights a heated debate on both sides of the Atlantic over how to encourage innovation in often life-saving devices while at the same time controlling risks.	   In the United States, disgruntled medical technology firms look enviously at the relaxed regulatory regime in Europe and some Republicans have used the European example to scold the Food and Drug Administration over its slower approval process.	   High-tech devices — from coronary stents and artificial heart valves to replacement hips and knees — can certainly get a green light faster in Europe than in the United States.	   But that is not always a good thing, according to Dr Alan Fraser, a cardiologist at Cardiff University, who has led a review of the European Union regulations for the ESC.	   “It tends to be that clinical trials are done after approval in Europe but before approval in the United States,” he said in an interview.	   “Where there have been isolated instances of devices that were associated with complications, those have disproportionately occurred in countries that have earlier approval — and that tends to be Europe.”	   Over the years there have been problems with a range of implanted devices, in heart medicine and other areas. 	   These have not been exclusively in Europe, as shown by last year’s massive worldwide recall of artificial hips by Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy unit. 	   Under a package of measures adopted more than 20 years ago, manufacturers selling devices in Europe must satisfy the “essential requirements” of safety and performance, but they do not necessarily need to show that a device benefits patients.	   Europe also has no centralised process for approving medical devices, unlike the United States, so manufacturers are free to seek approval from any EU country. The suspicion is that this leads to “forum shopping”, with companies choosing agencies offering the least burdensome and fastest reviews.	   The ESC would instead like to see a single coordinated European system, with more pre-market testing and post-marketing surveillance, as part of a move to close the gap between systems in different parts of the world.	   The hope among doctors is that new proposals set to go before EU ministers in 2012 will address these issues.	   “At least we want to agree on similar processes,” said the ESC’s president, Dr Michel Komajda of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital in Paris. “I don’t know if it will end up with really global standards but I think it is useful to have transatlantic discussions.”	   Similar issues are occupying his opposite number at the American College of Cardiology, Dr David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic, following calls for a shake-up to the 510(k) system under which most U.S. devices are approved. 	   Holmes said a middle way needed to be found between the flood of new devices that often hit the market in Europe and the much lower number seen in the United States.	   Nearly 80 coronary stents have been approved in Europe, for example, against only a handful in the United States.	   “There must be some happy medium. Some of the devices that have had CE approval were then shown to be neither any better and they could have been worse. That was too lax. On the other hand, there are devices that are just being approved in the United States that aren’t ever going to be used in Europe because they are too old,” Holmes said.	   Other than Johnson & Johnson, major makers of medical devices include Medtronic , Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories .

34,MDT,"J&J; may buy or develop new heart devices, CFO says"," * J&J interested in heart valve, heart pump technologies   * May acquire heart device products or develop internally   * Sees healthcare utilization stabilizing, but no rebound   By Susan Kelly   Sept 13 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is interested in adding heart valves and heart pumps to its product lineup as it reshapes its medical device portfolio but won’t overpay to acquire the technology, its chief financial officer said.   Three months after J&J announced it would stop selling drug-coated heart stents, once a key product line, CFO Dominic Caruso said the company sees other attractive technologies in the cardiac device market and could enter those markets either by acquiring another company or by developing the products organically.   He pointed to heart valves and left ventricular assist devices, which are pumps implanted in patients with advanced heart failure who are awaiting a transplant, as two promising opportunities in medical technology.   “Both are interesting. We are interested in looking at them,” said Caruso, speaking Tuesday on a webcast from an investor conference in New York.   J&J in June said it would stop selling drug-coated heart stents, a technology it pioneered but whose sales slumped in recent years due to safety concerns and fierce competition, ceding the market to Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Medtronic Inc (MDT.N).   Caruso said J&J exited the market because stents, which are implanted in clogged arteries to prop them open, had become a “commodity business” subject to pricing wars. Patients are well served with products already available, and the market is not rewarding companies for innovations in this area, he said.   J&J would consider acquiring a maker of heart valves or heart pumps at the right price, Caruso said. “Unfortunately,” he added, “they are overvalued today.” He did not name specific companies J&J might be interested in.   Heart valve innovator Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW.N), an often-rumored takeover target, and heart pump makers Thoratec Corp THOR.O and Heartware International Inc HTWR.O have seen their stocks benefit from anticipation of new products in development.   Caruso said the downturn in healthcare utilization that has hurt medical device sales over the past six quarters is stabilizing, but the industry remains under pressure. Patients continue to delay treatment due to high unemployment and steeper insurance deductibles as employers shift more of the cost of care to their workers.  “We have not seen any rebound in utilization,” he said.   Industry procedure volumes will improve as the healthcare reform law brings more patients into the marketplace beginning in 2014, Caruso said.   The industry is unlikely to see a repeal of a planned 2.3 percent tax on device sales, as some have called for, Caruso said.   Caruso also said J&J’s planned $21.67 billion purchase of Swiss orthopedic device maker Synthes SYST.VX is likely to close in the first half of 2012.

CONTACT: Paul Tran, 301-796-9001   The committee will discuss an application from Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) for Vytorin (ezetimibe/simvastatin) and Zetia (ezetimibe) tablets. Simvastatin lowers lipids, or fats that circulate in the bloodstream, including cholesterol, by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, which is an enzyme involved in producing lipids in the body, and ezetimibe lowers lipids by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine.   The proposed use for Zetia in combination with simvastatin or Vytorin is to reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease based on the results of the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP). SHARP was a clinical trial that studied the effect of Vytorin compared with placebo on the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease who did not have a history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, or heart bypass surgery or opening heart vessels with a balloon or stents. The primary outcome of major cardiovascular events was defined as the first occurrence of either nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac death, stroke, or coronary or noncoronary revascularization (including nontraumatic amputation). The primary analysis demonstrated that assignment to Vytorin significantly reduced the relative risk of a major cardiovascular event by 16 percent compared to placebo.

37,MDT,Medtech's new normal: pushback on procedures," * Ernst & Young report details pressures on device makers   * Finds companies will need to prove value to compete   By Susan Kelly   CHICAGO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Medical technology companies are under intensifying pressure to demonstrate that their products improve patients’ lives and make the healthcare system more efficient, a report from Ernst & Young concludes.   Government and private insurers’ efforts to rein in healthcare costs are straining hospital budgets, prompting a harder look at the value of comparable treatments. Hospitals are also standardizing purchasing decisions and relying less on physicians’ preferences for one brand of device over another in their efforts to cut costs.   At the same time, regulators are stepping up their scrutiny of new product applications, and patients are taking a more active role in choosing among treatment options.   “It is now becoming increasingly clear that medtech faces its own new normal,” the report said. The findings were scheduled to be presented on Tuesday at an industry meeting in Washington.   To compete, device makers will need to quantify successful patient outcomes as well as the cost effectiveness of the treatment, said John Babitt, head of Ernst & Young’s medtech practice for the Americas.   “The days of selling devices through sales reps who have a good relationship with a physician are numbered, if not over,” Babitt said in a telephone interview.   “Where we really see the battle lines being drawn, especially as physicians migrate more toward being hospital employees, is in negotiations with hospital payers, hospital administrators and the office of procurement,” he said.   More hospitals are relying on technology assessment committees and group purchasing organizations to consolidate purchasing decisions. Physicians who once had free reign to pick the device they preferred may find their options limited.   “In many cases, hospitals are imposing price caps or reducing the number of vendors from which they will purchase,” according to the report.   Ernst & Young found a disconnect between the medical technology industry’s rebound in growth as it has emerged from the depths of the recession and investors’ perceptions of the sector’s prospects.   Revenue for public medical technology companies totaled $315.9 billion in 2010, up 4 percent from the year before. Income for non-conglomerates in the United States and Europe, excluding one-time charges, increased 9 percent, last year.   Yet device company stocks, which have historically traded at a premium to the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, now trade at a discount, Babitt noted. “That is attributable to a perception that there is a lack of innovation to fuel growth,” he said.   Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) Vice Chairman Alex Gorsky said the medical device industry can take lessons from the pharmaceutical sector, which began struggling with similar challenges a decade ago.   It’s likely that changes brought by the current economic crisis, including tighter regulation, lower prices and stricter utilization standards, are here to stay, Gorsky said in comments contained in the report.   The industry needs to pay attention to how it is perceived as it addresses the safety, efficacy and affordability of medical devices, Gorsky said.   “Will we be seen as a faceless, uncaring industry that places profits ahead of people? Or will we be seen as an industry that “gets it,” that is helping to improve the lives of tens of millions of people every day and understands the need to do our fair share in order to bring our products and services to even more people in the years ahead?” he wrote.

40,MDT,FACTBOX-Impact of a Supreme Court ruling on the health law," Oct 6 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama’s sweeping overhaul of the nation’s healthcare system will top the agenda in the new U.S. Supreme Court term that opened on Monday. [ID:nS1E78S1LY]   Legal challenges to the healthcare reform law have focused on whether Congress exceeded its powers by requiring Americans to buy insurance or face a penalty.   Here is what the law means for various players in the health world:   The court is likely to issue a ruling on the law by the end of June, in the midst of the presidential campaign in which Obama seeks another four-year term. A ruling striking down the law would be a huge blow for Obama months before the election, giving a boost to his Republican opponent.   A ruling upholding the law would represent a vindication for Obama, but might make healthcare an even bigger rallying cry for the Republican presidential candidates, all of whom oppose it as a costly and unnecessary government expansion.   If the court declines to rule on the law’s constitutionality, Republicans may still continue their strategy of chipping away at individual provisions in the law piece-by-piece.   The requirement that all Americans buy insurance, called the individual mandate, provides the industry with a large and steady pool of customers. If the mandate is repealed, but companies such as Cigna (CI.N) or Wellpoint WLP.N are still forced to cover all Americans, including those with pre-existing health conditions, insurance premiums would likely rise.   White House officials argue it is only by requiring healthy people to purchase insurance that they can help pay for reforms, including a provision that individuals with pre-existing medical conditions cannot be refused coverage.   Some consumer groups argue a repeal of the individual mandate would lead to higher insurance premiums for Americans as a whole, as those without coverage would continue to use the emergency room as their only healthcare, shifting costs onto the insured.   Higher premiums could also reduce the number of those choosing to purchase insurance, undoing the law’s promise to extend health insurance to the more than 30 million Americans currently without it.   Small businesses are eligible for tax credits to help provide insurance benefits to their workers. They can also have more choice in insurance coverage, since state exchanges must have at least two multi-state health plans.   However, businesses with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance by 2014, when universal coverage is set to kick in, will have to pay a fee per employee.   Small firms argue the law does not address underlying high insurance costs and instead forces new requirements and taxes on companies, raising the cost of doing business.   The healthcare law includes fines for larger businesses where some employees seek subsidized coverage on state insurance exchanges that are to be up and running by 2014. It also penalizes companies that fail to provide minimum health coverage levels that will be determined by the law’s essential benefits rule.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, corporate America’s biggest lobbying group, supports the repeal of the healthcare law, which it blames for burdensome regulation and additional penalties and taxes.   States are charged with carrying out the bulk of the reforms in the healthcare law and many of those suing are still setting up state-run exchanges for health insurance and other elements. They hope to exert enough control to limit the reach of the law and also have access to federal funding if the Supreme Court rules the law is valid.   Along with worrying whether the law usurps their rights, states are concerned they cannot afford to carry out all of the changes it requires as they are tightening their fiscal belts.   Those in the industry have generally been on board with the new legislation, which will give them millions more patients who need drugs, hospitals and doctors. Most industry representatives are also wary of further legal uncertainty over the law that complicates planning.   The pharmaceutical industry — including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and other drugmakers — have to pay more than $2 billion a year in taxes starting from next year to help pay for the healthcare overhaul. They have also committed to offering certain drug rebates and discounts, expecting to balance those out with a boost from newly insured people. The repeal of the individual mandate would skew that math.   Rather than working to repeal the whole thing, drugmakers and others in the health industry are contesting specific provisions in the law, including a Medicare advisory board aimed at cost-cutting and another body that will closely compare the effectiveness of medications as well as other treatments.   Similar to the drugmakers, medical device companies also face higher taxes starting in 2013 to help pay for the law. Companies such as Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) are vigorously working to repeal the 2.3 percent sales tax.   The healthcare law is expected to give hospitals a flood of revenue from newly insured patients. It also cuts the cost of emergency care for uninsured patients, which hospitals are legally bound to provide. Hospitals are banking on that offsetting the payment cuts they have already started taking under the law. Obama’s legislation increases payments to physicians, although hospitals get lower payments from Medicare and Medicaid.

41,MDT,Small healthcare auctions see progress -sources,"* Small health deals attract private equity interest * Firms attract valuations of 8.5- to 10-times EBTIDA By Soyoung Kim and Jessica Hall Oct 18 (Reuters) - Several small-to-mid-sized healthcare assets have garnered interest from private equity firms, with Medtronic Inc’s Physio-Control unit fetching bids after past efforts to sell the business failed, sources said. In February, Medtronic said it had restarted the process of finding a buyer for its Physio-Control unit, which makes automated external defibrillators. The unit has about $450 million per year in revenue. Although the Medtronic unit has failed to find a buyer in the past, it now has received interest from private equity firms in an auction process that is “pretty far along,” said a source familiar with the situation, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Private equity firms have been active in healthcare this year, as they bet on rising use of services by aging populations in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Medtronic said it was proceeding with the divestiture as planned, but declined further comment. Meanwhile, World Courier Ground, which provides quick delivery services for medical samples, legal briefs and financial documents, has been put up for sale, sources said. The sources could not be identified because the talks were not public. The courier business has attracted a wide array of interest from private equity firms and rival delivery services, said the source. World Courier could not be immediately reached for comment. Meanwhile, Press Ganey Associates Inchas attracted takeover interest from firms including TPG Capital LPHellman & Friedman, sources said. Press Ganey collects data and performs surveys that medical centers and hospitals use to improve service, cut costs and increase patient care. Press Ganey, which has about $100 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), could fetch at least 10-times EBTIDA in a sale, sources said. Press Ganey, TPG and Hellman & Friedman were not immediately available to comment. Another healthcare auction, PRA International, fell apart a few weeks ago, sources said. It is possible that a bidder could come back with a low offer to try to scoop up the asset as a bargain, one source said. PRA, a contract research company, could not be immediately reached for comment. Contract research organizations provide drug research services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The last big private equity deal in healthcare was also for a contract research company, Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc .

42,MDT,Medtronic tests stent for erectile dysfunction,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc, a manufacturer of pacemakers, heart stents and spine products, has developed a device to tackle another common health problem: erectile dysfunction. The medical device maker said it completed an initial feasibility study of 30 men, average age of 60, who suffered from erectile dysfunction (ED). After three months the results were promising, the company said. The stent — a tiny wire mesh tube similar to those used to prop open heart arteries — was placed in the internal pudendal artery, which supplies blood to the penis. The stent was delivered using a catheter threaded up to the pelvis, where the pudendal artery is located. It was placed in the artery, opening the vessel and allowing for better blood flow. “ED is largely a vascular disease and that’s why Medtronic was interested in this,” said Dr. Jason Rogers of UC Davis Medical Center, one of the researchers of the company-sponsored trial. There are an estimated 30 million men in the United States who have ED and 300 million worldwide. Rogers said up to 50 percent of men discontinue drug therapy — which includes Viagra, Levitra and Cialis — either because it doesn’t work or because they can’t tolerate the side effects, including lowering of blood pressure. He also noted that men who take certain drugs for heart disease cannot use the popular pills. “There’s a real unmet clinical need,” Rogers said. Initial findings showed two-thirds of men who underwent the one- to two-hour procedure improved by at least four points on the 30-point Internal Index of Erectile Dysfunction scale, he said. There were no adverse events reported up to three months later, but Rogers acknowledged that risks may become evident much later. “This is still investigational and requires more research. It is the inception of an entirely new way of treating ED that has never been seen before,” he said.

45,MDT,Million-dollar payments to surgeons raise questions,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Orthopedic surgeons have received hundreds of millions of dollars from joint implant manufacturers in recent years, according to a report released Monday. In 2007, five device makers said they had paid surgeons more than $198 million, with 43 payments exceeding $1 million. While the number of payments appears to have dropped since 2007, the average dollar amount has gone up, based on data from the three manufacturers that disclosed physician payments made in the last several years. “There is a lot of money flowing back and forth,” said Jason Hockenberry of Emory University, whose findings are published in the Archives of Internal Medicine. Those financial ties represent anything from consulting fees to royalties to research support. Some argue they are necessary to drive medical innovations, but others fear they could end up harming patients as well. Doctors getting industry money could be quicker to use implants from the companies paying them, for instance, or downplay the side effects of those products in their research. The new results come as the U.S. Senate investigates whether surgeons paid by Medtronic, a medical device maker not included in the current study, failed to report sterility and other complications stemming from the company’s bone-growth implant Infuse. “There is evidence from other studies that these relationships drive practice one way or another,” said Dr. Seth Leopold, of the University of Washington School of Medicine, who was not involved in the new work. An orthopedic surgeon himself, Leopold chose to sever all ties to device makers in 2005. “I felt there was no way I’d be able to convince people that these dollars did not affect my clinical decisions,” he told Reuters Health. After seeing the new report, Leopold added, he realized he was just “a smalltime guy.” Hockenberry’s findings are based on data released after the five largest orthopedic implant makers — Biomet Orthopedics, DePuy Orthopedics, Smith & Nephew, Stryker Orthopedics and Zimmer — settled a kickback probe with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2007. That year, the companies made more than 1,000 physician payments. In 2008, after the companies found out they’d have to disclose those relationships, the number fell by almost half. But the three companies that continue to voluntarily disclose payments increased the amount of money they paid doctors by more than 40 percent between 2008 and 2010. The mean, or mid-range, amount of individual payments also rose slightly, from $212,740 in 2007 to $233,108 in 2010. “If you are concerned about your physician’s loyalties you should by all means ask them,” said Hockenberry, stressing that the majority don’t have industry ties. “The reality is, only four percent of all orthopedic surgeons are receiving funds,” he said. It is currently unclear what impact commercial relationships have on patient care. Hockenberry said he’d like to know more about the doctors who stopped taking industry money after the 2007 settlement and those who continued to do so. “We would also love to be able to tie this to clinical practice,” he said. One way to do so would be to establish a universal device registry for all the implants patients get, so that it would be possible to look at the link between company payments and physician practice patterns. According to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed last year, manufacturers must report payments of more than $10 by 2013, and this information will be freely available online. But in an editorial on the new study, Dr. Robert Steinbrook of Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, said disclosure alone isn’t enough. “The disclosure of industry payments should not divert attention from the real issues with regard to conflict of interest,” he writes. “These are the minimization or elimination of financial ties between physicians and industry in areas other than research support, bona fide consulting related to basic and clinical research, and legitimate payments related to intellectual property. Although many well-publicized examples with regard to conflict of interest involve physicians in specific fields, such as orthopedics or psychiatry, the issues are similar for all specialties.” SOURCE: bit.ly/uJGWr9 and bit.ly/u0srxV Archives of Internal Medicine, October 24, 2011.",10242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-surgeons-million-dollar/million-dollar-payments-to-surgeons-raise-questions-idUSTRE79N7LE20111024
46,MDT,Exclusive: Medtronic probes insulin pump risks,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc has asked software security experts to investigate the safety of its insulin pumps, as a new claim surfaced that at least one of its devices could be hacked to dose diabetes patients with potentially lethal amounts of insulin. While there are no known examples of such a cyber attack on a medical device, Medtronic told Reuters that it was doing “everything it can” to address the security flaws. Security software maker McAfee, which has a health industry business, exposed the new vulnerability in one model of the Medtronic Paradigm insulin pump on Friday and believes there could be similar risks in others. Medtronic and McAfee declined to say which model is involved or how many such pumps are currently used by patients. It has two models of insulin pumps on the market and supports six older versions, with about 200,000 currently in use by patients. The finding points to a broader issue — the potential for cyber attacks on medical devices ranging from diagnostic equipment to pumps and heart defibrillators, which rely on software and wireless technology to work. “This is an evolution from having to think about security and safety as a healthcare company, and really about keeping people safe on our therapy, to this different question about keeping people safe around criminal or malicious intent,” Catherine Szyman, president of Medtronic’s diabetes division, said in an interview. Szyman, whose nephew uses a wearable Medtronic insulin pump, said the company turned to McAfee rival Symantec Corp and other security firms after an independent researcher exposed less serious vulnerabilities in the pumps in August. Since then, a research team at Intel Corp’s McAfee said it has developed code that allows it to gain complete control of the functions of one Medtronic insulin pump model from as far away as 300 feet. “We found a way around all the restrictions and all the limitations,” said Stuart McClure, a senior vice president with McAfee who heads up the research team. McClure, formerly a security expert at healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente, says he is exposing such problems to draw them to the attention of manufacturers and regulators. McClure’s team used a Windows PC and an antennae that communicates with the medical device over the same radio spectrum used for some cordless phones. The type of vulnerability discovered by McAfee could theoretically be used as a new cyber weapon. A hacker could launch a “drive-by” attack aimed at a high-profile target, such as a politician or corporate executive, who uses this type of insulin pump, McAfee researchers said. In August, Medtronic acknowledged that security flaws in its implanted insulin pumps could allow hackers to remotely take control of the devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration noted that there is no evidence of widespread problems from medical device security breaches. It says that device manufacturers are responsible for the safety of their software. “Any system with wireless communication can be subject to interception of data and compromised privacy as well as interference with performance that can compromise the safety and effectiveness of the device,” FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson said. “We continue to closely monitor for safety or security problems.” Medtronic is a leading makers of insulin pumps along with Johnson & Johnson’s Animas Corp and Insulet Corp. McAfee did not report vulnerabilities in models from other manufacturers. The fresh concerns over the pumps made by Medtronic, the world’s largest medical device maker, follow a high-profile recall of heart defibrillator leads in 2007 and a more recent Senate probe into whether doctors it had paid failed to report problems from a spinal surgery product. The company said it is also consulting with McAfee and has informed patients, through its website, to check their insulin pumps if they have a suspicious encounter with another person. Medtronic officials have said it would be difficult to make changes to pumps already in use because of FDA regulations that require device makers to get agency approval before altering their products, including issuing software patches. The company would likely have to first get FDA approval and then recall each pump, which uses wireless communications technology dating back 12 to 15 years, so that technicians could install the new software and check the equipment to make sure that it still accurately delivers doses of insulin. Szyman said she could not say how long it would take Medtronic to come up with a fix for the vulnerabilities because its investigation is still ongoing. It is also unclear how long it might take the FDA to approve changes to the pumps. “There’s different pathways to approval,” she told Reuters, noting that the agency typically takes six to 12 months to approve a new medical device. Medtronic’s diabetes products, which includes its insulin pumps, accounted for more than $1.3 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year, out of a total of nearly $16 billion. The Medtronic pump vulnerability was discovered by Barnaby Jack, a well-known security expert who joined McAfee last year after gaining notoriety by finding ways to hack into ATMs used at convenience stores, then force them to literally spit out cash. The manufacturers have since fixed the flaw by updating the software that runs those machines. The nightmare scenario, according to McAfee, involves a hostile actor launching a potentially fatal attack by taking control of an insulin pump, then ordering it to dump all the insulin in its canister. That is something that was hard to imagine when the product was first designed - long before the recent rash of hacking attacks: “We are talking about code that was written over ten years ago,” said Jack. “They never expected anybody to pop these devices open and look under the hood. We are trying to spark some change and get a secure initiative under way and get these devices fixed.” Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas that converts glucose into energy. In patients with diabetes, the body makes no insulin, or insulin levels are too low. This can cause the amount of glucose in the bloodstream to rise, a condition known as hyperglycemia. When too much insulin is released into the blood stream, a person’s blood sugar can become too low, a condition known as hypoglycemia. Symptoms of hypoglycemia range from nausea and confusion to, in severe cases, seizures, coma and death. McClure declined to say how many models in Medtronic’s line of insulin pumps were vulnerable. He said there is no evidence anybody else has identified the flaw or tried to exploit it. “We just tested one model number,” McClure said. “But we believe that more than that are vulnerable.” His team demonstrated the vulnerability at a McAfee users conference in Las Vegas on Friday. McAfee has consulted with experts at the Department of Homeland Security’s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, or ICS-CERT. That agency works with private companies in industries including healthcare to help investigate potential cyber vulnerabilities in their products. Officials with ICS-CERT and Symantec could not be reached for comment.

47,MDT,Medtronic heart device has safety issues: FDA staff,"(Reuters) - U.S. reviewers said a Medtronic Inc device was effective for treating a common heart rhythm disorder, but they raised concerns about its safety. Medtronic’s Cardiac Ablation System is designed to treat persistent atrial fibrillation, a major cause of strokes. But, in documents released on Tuesday, Food and Drug Administration staff expressed concerns about the high rate of stroke found in patients treated with the device. Atrial fibrillation, which affects more than 2 million Americans, is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder. It describes the rapid and irregular contraction of the heart’s upper two chambers, which allows blood to pool. This can form clots that travel to the brain and cause strokes. Medtronic is seeking approval for the device as a treatment for persistent atrial fibrillation, which lasts for more than seven days or recurs for as long as four years. The company said just over half of patients have persistent atrial fibrillation, but there are no FDA-approved devices to treat this condition. In a clinical trial, five people out of 176 had a stroke within a month of getting the Medtronic device, and 38 people had at least one serious problem such as low blood pressure or swelling of the covering around the heart, FDA reviewers said. The device helped some people in clinical trials; 55.8 percent of patients had regular heartbeats within six months of using Medtronic’s device, compared to 26.4 percent of patients who used the typical treatment of anti-arrhythmic drugs to treat atrial fibrillation. A panel of outside experts will consider the device at a meeting on Thursday, with the FDA set to make a final decision. Given the FDA’s safety concerns, Sanford Bernstein analyst Derrick Sung said he sees a 50 percent chance of the panel recommending the device for approval. “We would emphasize that investor expectations are low,” Sung said in a research note. Anti-arrhythmic drugs such as beta-blockers can help restore a normal rhythm. However, Medtronic and other companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific are turning to ablation devices to treat atrial fibrillation. While such ablation devices are still a relatively small part of the multibillion atrial fibrillation market, analysts expect it to grow. Ablation is a non-surgical technique used to neutralize the cells within the heart muscle that are responsible for starting or maintaining these abnormally fast, and sometimes lethal rhythms. The Medtronic device uses catheter ablation, which involves inserting a thin tube into a blood vessel, usually through a site in the upper leg or neck, then threading it though the body until it reaches the heart. When it reaches the area causing abnormal rhythms, a device emits radiofrequency energy to destroy the tissue. Medtronic received FDA approval in December 2010 to sell a different ablation device for treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is intermittent — meaning it lasts for less than seven days — but recurring. Medtronic shares fell 1.5 percent to $34.19 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, below a 1.1 percent drop in the S&P; Health Care Equipment index.

49,MDT,Researcher sees cancer risk for Medtronic's Infuse,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s controversial orthopedic product Infuse, a bioengineered bone-growth protein used in spine surgery, is linked to a greater risk of cancer than previously thought, a prominent researcher said on Thursday. Infuse was once hailed as a major advance in spine surgery and is now the subject of investigations by the U.S. Senate and the Department of Justice over omissions of safety problems from its clinical trial data and over off-label use. Infuse also drew intense public scrutiny after the influential Spine Journal, an Elsevier publication, devoted its entire June issue to examining growth products including the recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2, or BMP-2, as it is more commonly known. The Journal noted at the time that surgeons, who were paid tens of millions of dollars by Medtronic, failed to report serious complications from Infuse, including cancer, sterility in men, infections, bone dissolution and worsened back and leg pain. The article said complications occurred in 10 to 50 percent of patients who got the product in 13 Medtronic-funded clinical trials between 2000 and 2010. Dr. Eugene Carragee, a Stanford University School of Medicine professor and editor-in-chief of the Spine Journal who also authored the June article, said his latest analysis better quantified the link between BMPs and pancreatic, breast and prostate cancers. It included the low-dose form of Infuse that is on the market, and a high-dose version called Amplify that has been rejected by health regulators. His findings on BMPs, presented at the annual North American Spine Society meeting in Chicago on Thursday, reflected a 2.5 times greater risk of developing cancer one year after the product was used and a five times greater risk after three years. Carragee says he plans to submit his findings for publication. “Almost certainly this is cancer promoting and not a carcinogenic,” he told Reuters in an interview, noting that exposure to a carcinogen takes many more years to result in disease. He said Infuse was linked to a cancer diagnosis more often than when the product was not used at all. Amplify was tied to more cancer risk than Infuse. Carragee said he analyzed pooled data, which has its limitations since they include the different doses of the product and different approaches to using it. The data were made available by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Yet all of the pooled data from Medtronic’s BMP trials, which strictly excluded patients who had current or previous malignancies, demonstrated higher rates of cancer. Earlier this year, the FDA raised concerns about BMPs, refusing to approve Medtronic’s application for Amplify after its reviewers had a lengthy debate about the cancer risk. That decision in March also prompted some doctors to question the safety of the lower-dose Infuse. Medtronic, the world’s largest stand-alone medical technology company with annual sales of $16 billion, said Infuse sales slid some 17 percent after the Spine Journal article. Analysts estimate Infuse generated sales of $750 million to $800 million in fiscal 2011, ended in April. Infuse, approved by FDA for use in some spinal fusion surgeries and dental procedures, is also used for unapproved purposes, or off-label, at the physician’s discretion. While such use is not illegal, the company is prohibited by law from marketing the product for off-label purposes. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation is underway to determine whether that was the case for Infuse. Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak, who took the helm in June, said in an interview on Friday that he would do whatever was necessary to ensure patient safety and maintain the integrity of the 62-year-old company. “We will take whatever action is required to guarantee that,” said Ishrak, who was CEO of General Electric Co’sGE Health Systems before joining Medtronic.

The company also kept its forecast for earnings growth this year. “The fact that they did not reduce guidance was a big positive,” Tim Nelson, an analyst with Nuveen Asset Management said, adding that this probably helped fuel the rally in the shares. “It was good to hear Omar reiterate the strategy ... but turning around a ship this big is going to take years, not months,” Nelson said. Earnings were $871 million, or 82 cents per share, in the second fiscal quarter that ended Oct. 28, compared with $566 million, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 84 cents a share, 2 cents above the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $4.13 billion from $3.90 billion a year ago. Sales of Infuse, a bone growth product used in spinal fusions, fell 16 percent in the quarter. The product has come under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and doctors over concerns that researchers omitted references to side effects from its clinical trials. “We are watching this carefully and remain cautious,” Ishrak said about Infuse sales, which also dropped sharply in the company’s first quarter. He declined to predict a bottom in sales. Medtronic has paid Yale researchers to re-evaluate the Infuse data. Based on those results, Ishrak said, the company will take whatever action is necessary “irrespective of financial consequences.” Until the Yale review is completed, it is hard to say what actions might need to be taken, Ishrak said in an interview. “We believe (Infuse) is safe — that data already has been reviewed by FDA,” he said. “Off-label use is something we do not promote. If we need further studies to clarify something, that’s what we’ll do.” Medtronic shares were up $1.23, or 3.7 percent, at $34.50 on the the New York Stock Exchange and traded as high as $34.75, as the broad market slipped. Gabelli & Co analyst Jeff Jonas said expectations on Wall Street for Medtronic results had been set very low. “They seem to know the challenges they are facing and they are trying to address them,” said Jonas, whose funds hold a small number of Medtronic shares. “It still remains to be seen whether they can do that.” For the second half, the company still sees revenue growth from continuing operations of 1 percent to 3 percent. For the full fiscal year, it reiterated its forecast of earnings-per-share growth, excluding items, between 6 percent and 9 percent.",11222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic/update-4-medtronic-earnings-beat-forecasts-shares-up-idUSN1E7AK1GC20111122

57,MDT,Boston Sci stent vulnerable to deformation-study,"* Boston Scientific’s Omega stent fares poorly in study * Medtronic’s Driver stent also vulnerable to deformation * Stent study review gets expedited publication Dec 1 (Reuters) - A heart stent manufactured by Boston Scientific Corp fared poorly in tests to see how vulnerable it was to shrinking or lengthening after implantation, according to researchers. Tests on seven stent designs found the Boston Scientific Omega, the design that will be used for all of the company’s newer generation stents, and Medtronic Inc’s Driver stent require significantly less force to become deformed. The study, published online in JACC Cardiovascular Interventions late Wednesday, tested different designs of stents — tiny wire mesh tubular devices that prop open diseased heart vessels. The results may reinforce concerns about shrinking and lengthening, a problem known as longitudinal compression. “Future stent designs are likely to be more mindful of longitudinal integrity. We think that standardized testing of longitudinal strength should be available to cardiologists to aid in stent selection,” researchers concluded. Concerns about stent deformation were raised in two smaller cardiology journals published in the United States and Europe in recent weeks, and the issue was the subject of a discussion at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics meeting in San Francisco last month. In the case of longitudinal deformation, the stents become deformed inside the vessel, creating a clotting risk that could lead to heart attack. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said factors that appear to predispose a patient to the problem include calcification of coronary arteries, implantation in a twisted blood vessel, and improper positioning of a stent.",12012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/stents/boston-sci-stent-vulnerable-to-deformation-study-idUSN1E7B010U20111201

The company was accused of seeking physicians to participate in studies and registries and paying doctors fees of between $1,000 to $2,000 per patient for information and data collected as long as they used Medtronic’s devices, according to the Justice Department.

62,MDT,Medtronic remote diabetes monitor gets U.S. approval,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc on Wednesday said it received regulatory approval for the first remote glucose monitor that will let parents check the blood sugar of a diabetic child sleeping in another room. About three out of four severe hypoglycemic reactions, in which a diabetic’s blood sugar drops to a dangerously low level, occur overnight. Parents of children with diabetes typically get up several times a night to check whether the child’s blood sugar is within healthy levels. The bedside monitor, with an alarm that alerts the caregiver to blood glucose changes, helps protect against low blood sugar episodes, which can lead to seizures or even coma or death. Parents and other caregivers can see a child’s or adult’s glucose trends and insulin pump information on the device, called the mySentry Remote Glucose Monitor, and can take action to prevent a further decline in blood sugar if needed or remain in bed if all is well. Britta Bushnell, whose 11-year-old son Kaden Kessel was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was 2, is used to getting up during the night to check her child’s blood sugar. She believes having a monitor could have prevented two low-glucose episodes that caused Kaden to temporarily lose the use of his limbs and ability to speak. The suburban Los Angeles mother received a monitor last summer as part of Medtronic’s evaluation process for the device. “It gives a peace of mind at night that is just very difficult to have any other way,” Bushnell said in an interview. When Kaden is older, the monitor will be placed beside his bed where it will wake him when he is ready to take care of his own insulin needs. “This puts college in a whole new light for me,” Bushnell said. The mySentry monitor, which costs about $3,000, works with Medtronic’s MiniMed Paradigm Real-Time Revel System, an insulin pump with built-in continuous glucose monitoring. In addition to displaying blood sugar readings, the device provides information on the insulin pump battery life and amount of insulin remaining. About 3 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, a disease in which the immune system destroys cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Patients must monitor their blood sugar and inject themselves with insulin throughout the day to prevent potential complications such as blindness, heart disease and kidney disease. Medtronic, a leading maker of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors, is among the companies and researchers working to develop an artificial pancreas system that ultimately would provide insulin dosing automatically. The company’s most advanced insulin pump, the Paradigm Veo, includes an automated safety feature called low-glucose suspend that shuts off the insulin flow when glucose falls low. The device, connected to patients through a small catheter placed just under the skin, is sold in 50 countries outside the United States. Medtronic recently received approval to begin a U.S. clinical study for the device that will enroll a minimum of 285 patients at 20 U.S. sites. The company hopes to be able to sell the product in the United States in about 2-1/2 years, Greg Meehan, general manager of Medtronic’s continuous glucose monitoring business, said in an interview. Medtronic is also looking to develop monitoring technology that can one day work with consumer devices including mobile phones, Meehan said. “This is the first step in what we think is going to be a significant innovation category for diabetes care in the future,” he said.",1042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-medtronic-diabetes/medtronic-remote-diabetes-monitor-gets-u-s-approval-idUSTRE8031JT20120104

64,MDT,"Medtronic still struggling with spine, ICD sales","(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) reported disappointing quarterly results on Tuesday, reflecting continued weak demand for its implantable heart defibrillators and spine products, two of its biggest businesses. The world’s largest stand-alone medical device maker said sales in each of those units fell 9 percent in the fiscal third quarter, showing no improvement from the poor performance that has lasted for several years. Medtronic’s business has been hurt by a series of setbacks, most recently the weak global economy that has pressured governments to cut healthcare spending and kept patients out of the doctor’s office. “The year-over-year decline is not sustainable. We urgently need to see signs of improvement” in Medtronic’s spine business, Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak told analysts on a conference call. If improvement is not seen, he added, “we will need to assess our strategy and approach to this business.” Ishrak said options include organic alternatives, meaning that the company would not necessarily look to sell the unit. Shares of world’s largest stand-alone medical device maker fell 2.6 percent to $39.90 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. “Clearly he has opened the door to doing something differently. Those comments will be welcomed by the investor community,” Tim Nelson, an analyst with Nuveen Asset Management, said. In a telephone interview, Ishrak declined to say how long it may take for business to improve, but he noted that there are signs of stability in both the spine and implantable defibrillator, or ICD, markets. The units will also benefit as the comparison with year-earlier results gets easier over time. Medtronic sells a wide array of products used in spine surgery, including artificial discs, fusion systems, and biologics products, which stimulate the body to regrow bone, eliminating the need to harvest bone from another body part. Taking advantage of global opportunities is one example of an initiative that has not been taken yet in the spine business, which was undermined by a larger-than-expected decline in Infuse sales, a genetically engineered bone graft. Safety concerns over Infuse have grown in the last year since U.S. lawmakers began investigating whether doctors paid by Medtronic failed to report serious side effects, and independent researchers found a heightened cancer risk associated with the product. “We’ll look at things we can do organically ... adding to the business or divesting portions of the business,” Ishrak said. He declined to elaborate. “We realize that despite everything, we’re still positioned well in spine. Overall it is still an attractive market and we are leaders in that market. We are still in the best position to grow and make a difference,” Ishrak added. Goldman Sachs analyst David Roman reckoned the softness in spine sales was likely due to a decline in procedures as patients put off treatment in a weak economy, and continued pricing pressure. He attributed slow European ICD sales to pressure on budgets for state-run health plans. Medtronic reported total net earnings of $935 million, or 88 cents per share, for the third quarter that ended January 27, compared with $924 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 84 cents per share, matching the average estimate on Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Quarterly net sales rose to $3.92 billion from $3.86 billion.

Our A+/Stable/A-1+ rating on medical device manufacturer Medtronic Inc. 	 reflect the company’s “strong” business risk profile and “modest” financial 	 risk profile, according to our criteria. Contributing to Medtronic’s strong 	 business risk profile is its significant scale (over $16 billion revenues) and 	 product diversity. Geography is also diverse—in 2011, 45% of sales were 	 generated outside the U.S. We expect near-term revenue growth to be in the 	 low-single-digit area. Stabilization in CRDM and spinal sales could stem the 	 drag on total revenue growth, and provide better-than-expected performance. 	 Medtronic should be able to drive more meaningful revenue growth in the medium 	 term as a result of acquisitions, ongoing product launches, and geographic 	 expansion. We expect a stable EBITDA margin over the next few years, as 	 restructuring efforts offset the implementation of the legislated medical 	 device tax (2.3% of U.S. device revenues) on Jan. 1, 2013. Medtronic’s 	 “modest” financial risk profile is evidenced by under 2x adjusted debt 	 leverage, very strong cash flow generation, and conservative financial 	 policies.

71,MDT,Medtronic to pay $85 million to settle Infuse lawsuit,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc said it agreed to pay $85 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit accusing it of making misleading statements concerning Infuse, a genetically engineered bone graft used in spinal surgery. The settlement resolves claims that Medtronic failed to reveal that as much as 85.2 percent of Infuse sales depended on so-called “off-label” uses, where doctors sometimes paid by Medtronic would prescribe the product for applications not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Shareholders said Infuse sales and Medtronic’s share price fell after the company revealed that the U.S. Department of Justice was probing off-label marketing and the U.S. Senate began its own inquiry. Infuse sales totaled about $800 million in Medtronic’s 2011 fiscal year, but the Minneapolis-based company last August said sales were declining by a high-teens percentage amid the federal inquiries. Net sales for the entire company totaled $15.9 billion in fiscal 2011. Medtronic expects to take a charge for the settlement in its fiscal fourth quarter ending on April 27. It also said that under the settlement, it explicitly denied making any misrepresentations or omissions, or that it otherwise engaged in any wrongdoing. Settlement papers were not immediately available. Salvatore Graziano, a lawyer for the shareholders, declined to comment.

Infuse sales totaled about $800 million in Medtronic’s 2011 fiscal year, but the Minneapolis-based company last August said sales were declining by a high-teens percentage amid the federal inquiries. Net sales for the entire company totaled $15.9 billion in fiscal 2011. Medtronic expects to take a charge for the settlement in its fiscal fourth quarter ending on April 27. It also said that under the settlement, it explicitly denied making any misrepresentations or omissions, or that it otherwise engaged in any wrongdoing. Settlement papers were not immediately available. Salvatore Graziano, a lawyer for the shareholders, declined to comment. According to an amended complaint, the case covered investors who owned Medtronic shares between Nov. 20, 2006 and Nov. 17, 2008. Lead plaintiffs in the case are the Teachers’ Retirement System of Oklahoma; the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension Fund, Germany’s Union Asset Management Holding AG, and Denmark’s Danske Invest Management A/S, court papers show.

74,MDT,Medtronic backs heart-lead report that irks St Jude,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc said on Monday it agreed with research findings that favored the medical device maker’s Sprint Quattro heart defibrillator lead over a rival product by St Jude Medical Inc. St Jude on Friday urged medical journal HeartRhythm to retract an article on the research written by Dr. Robert Hauser of the Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation. Hauser had analyzed data on lead failures and death rates for St Jude’s Riata and Riata ST defibrillator leads - which were discontinued in December 2010 because of insulation problems - and Medtronic’s Quattro leads. He concluded that St Jude’s leads, which are insulated wires that connect an implanted defibrillator to the heart, were prone to failures that led to deaths. Fewer deaths were linked to the Medtronic lead, he said, based on data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s MAUDE database. St Jude said Hauser’s analysis undercounted reports of deaths involving Medtronic’s Quattro leads. Medtronic, however, said it reviewed the data on Quattro, following criteria outlined in Hauser’s article. “The conclusions we have reached about Sprint Quattro are consistent with what Dr. Hauser found, and we confirm his results related to Sprint Quattro,” Medtronic said in a statement emailed to Reuters. Hauser said the St Jude lead failures appeared to be caused by insulation defects that resulted in short-circuiting between high-voltage components. St Jude, in a press release Friday, said its own analysis of the FDA database could not reproduce the numbers reported in the HeartRhythm article. The company also criticized the use of the database to evaluate rates of adverse events and to compare devices. A spokeswoman for the Heart Rhythm Society, publisher of the HeartRhythm journal, could not be reached for comment on St Jude’s request for a retraction. St Jude informed doctors last November that the leads have a higher rate of insulation failures than initially reported. The company advised against removing or replacing the leads. The company said it had reports that two patients had died and one had suffered a serious injury during procedures to remove the leads. FDA subsequently classified St Jude’s advisory as a recall. Last week, St Jude halted sales of two more brands of lead wires used in its cardiac resynchronization therapy devices due to worn insulation. Those products, the QuickSite and QuickFlex leads, connect to the heart a device that uses a specialized pacemaker to re-coordinate the action of the right and left ventricles in patients with congestive heart failure. On the New York Stock Exchange, St Jude fell $2.06, or 5.03 percent, to close at $38.91, and Medtronic ended down 45 cents, or 1.18 percent, at $37.75.

76,MDT,UPDATE 1-Medtronic device approved for more heart patients,"April 10 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc said on Tuesday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved its implantable heart defibrillator with resynchronization therapy for a wider group of patients. The FDA approved the device, known as CRT-D, for mildly symptomatic heart failure patients. This treatment potentially can improve survival, reduce hospitalizations, and prevent disease progression, Medtronic said. The latest approval would potentially increase the number of patients eligible for the advanced therapy by 620,000 worldwide, including nearly 200,000 in the United States, the company said. Heart failure affects more than 22 million people worldwide,  including more than 5.8 million in the United States. Previously, Medtronic’s CRT-D devices were only approved to treat certain patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure. While certain of the mildly symptomatic heart failure patients could already receive an implantable	 cardioverter defibrillator to protect them from sudden cardiac arrest, they are still vulnerable to a further weakening of their heart. CRT-D therapy works by resynchronizing the contractions of both ventricles by sending electrical impulses to the heart muscles, improving the blood-pumping capability.

77,MDT,REFILE-UPDATE 1-St Jude shares tumble on heart lead woes,"* St Jude seeks retraction, shares fall 5 pct * Comes after sales of other leads halted * Rival Medtronic backs research on its product By Susan Kelly CHICAGO, April 9 (Reuters) - Shares in St Jude Medical Inc  tumbled 5 percent on Monday after it called on a medical journal to retract an article that said its Riata and Riata ST defibrillator leads were prone to failures that have led to patient deaths. Although the article was published March 26, St Jude’s call for a retraction on Friday drew attention to it only days after the company said it was halting sales of two other types of leads due to worn insulation. In medical journal HeartRhythm, Dr. Robert Hauser of the Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation examined deaths reported in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration database, analysing data on the Riata and Riata ST defibrillator leads, which were discontinued in December 2010 because of insulation problems. “These failures appeared to be caused by insulation defects that resulted in short-circuiting between high-voltage components,” Hauser wrote. Hauser’s team also looked at deaths associated with Medtronic Inc’s Quattro Secure leads, and found fewer deaths linked to that product. Medtronic said on Monday it agreed with the research about its product. But St Jude said Hauser’s analysis undercounted reports of deaths involving Medtronic’s Quattro leads and was therefore invalid. “We are seeking retraction and removal of the article from Heart Rhythm and will be making our research available to the Heart Rhythm Society for independent verification,” St Jude spokeswoman Amy Jo Meyer said in an email. “Our intent in correcting the manuscript and in calling for a retraction is simply that our research indicates that the data in the published manuscript is in error.” On the New York Stock Exchange, shares in St Jude fell $2.06, or 5.0 percent, to close at $38.91 and have lost 11 percent since March 26. Medtronic ended down 45 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $37.75.

78,MDT,Medtronic to boost safety monitoring of devices,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc plans to ramp up monitoring of its medical devices after they are implanted in order to catch potential safety problems earlier, as the industry wrestles with some headline-grabbing recalls. Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said it was the responsibility of companies to monitor devices for safety problems after they are approved rather than relying on irregular reports from doctors or patients, as they do now. He also said registries, or nationwide databases, that some groups have proposed to keep track of patients with devices, would not be enough to collect the kind of comprehensive data needed to catch safety problems. “We need improvements in device surveillance,” he told Reuters on Monday. “The FDA alone does not have the infrastructure... so companies have to play a leading role in this.” Consumer groups have urged the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to impose more rigorous testing of devices before they are approved to avoid safety failures, including issues with metal-on-metal hip implants and surgical mesh. In the latest high-profile setback, Medtronic rival St. Jude Medical Inc was forced to halt sales of some defibrillator leads, or wires that carry electricity from defibrillators to the heart, because of concerns their insulation could wear away. An article in the medical journal HeartRhythm had also linked failures of an older version of St. Jude’s leads to patient deaths, denting the company’s shares. Medtronic, the world’s largest stand-alone medical device maker, came under fire last year after allegations that researchers hid serious complications with its spine product Infuse during clinical trials. Ishrak said Medtronic plans to invest “heavily” in keeping track of patients’ health after they get a new device, and doing regular analysis of the data to spot any worrying trends. “You have to address these issues as early as possible,” he said, adding that pre-market testing would never be able to catch every possible problem. Ishrak declined to comment on what impact St. Jude’s woes could have on Medtronic’s sales of heart defibrillators, or how it might affect the overall market. “We’re focused on winning with what we have,” he said. In 2010, Medtronic had 46 percent of the multi-billion-dollar market for implantable heart defibrillators. St. Jude had 29 percent of the market and Boston Scientific Corp had a 25 percent share.

79,MDT,St. Jude's Riata lead performed poorly in study,"May 10 (Reuters) - St. Jude Medical Inc’s Riata defibrillator lead, which was recalled late last year, performed “significantly worse” than a competing lead called Quattro, sold by competitor Medtronic Inc, in a large study, researchers said. Leads are wires that transmit electricity from a defibrillator, known as an ICD, to the heart. Researchers, who presented their findings at the Heart Rhythm Society’s Annual Scientific Sessions in Boston, said Riata leads, but not Riata ST leads, were significantly worse than Quattro. But Riata ST patients were followed for a shorter time than Riata patients. Studies are needed to determine how to best monitor these leads and how to manage them safely, the researchers said. St. Jude’s Riata and Riata ST ICD leads were recalled late last year after reports that the silicone coating around the wires eroded at a higher-than-expected rate. The company halted sales of Riata in late 2010. St. Jude, the second-largest maker of ICDs after Medtronic, recently published a report updating the performance of all of the company’s cardiac rhythm management devices. As of Feb. 29, St. Jude said there were 671 confirmed cases of problems with Riata and Riata ST ICD leads, which equates to a 0.30 percent incidence. Of the 671 problem leads, 500 were not returned and 171 were returned for analysis after a patient had them removed and replaced, or when they were removed after death. The authors of the report said the failure rate was probably underestimated since problems are only recorded when doctors file complaints. Last month, St. Jude halted sales of its QuickSite and QuickFlex defibrillator leads due to concerns that the insulation could wear away and expose the wires. Around the same time, HeartRhythm, a prominent medical journal, published an article by Dr. Robert Hauser of the Minneapolis Heart Institute that took a critical look at the Riata lead line that was recalled in 2011. The article concluded that the product failed at a higher rate than Medtronic’s lead, prompting St. Jude to ask for a retraction and drawing even more attention to the issue.

80,MDT,St Jude is latest to launch blood pressure device,"* Gets European approval for hypertension treatment * Joins Medtronic, Covidien selling such devices in Europe * World market could top $2 bln by 2020 - analysts By Susan Kelly May 15 (Reuters) - St Jude Medical Inc said it won European approval to begin selling a device that lowers blood pressure by creating tiny scars along the renal nerves, joining a growing number of medical technology companies developing hypertension treatments. The St Jude device, called the EnligHTN Renal Denervation System, is intended for patients whose high blood pressure is resistant to drug therapy, or about one quarter of those who have hypertension. An estimated 68 million Americans, or one in three, have high blood pressure, considered a risk factor for heart disease, the world’s No. 1 killer. St Jude has not yet disclosed an expected U.S. launch date for the product, a spokeswoman for the St Paul, Minnesota-based medical device maker said. Several medical technology companies are investing heavily in developing device-based high blood pressure treatments, and analysts foresee a large potential market. Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy expects the first systems to hit the U.S. market in about two years and estimates the worldwide market could grow to $2.8 billion by 2020. “It’s an enormous market. There are literally hundreds of millions of people around the world who could benefit from this,” said Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy said. He noted so far the devices have shown few negative side effects. Leading U.S. device makers that have already received approval to sell hypertension products in Europe include Medtronic Inc, the frontrunner, and Covidien Inc . The ablation procedure, known as renal denervation, involves threading a catheter through the renal arteries from the femoral artery in the groin. The catheter delivers radiofrequency energy to create tiny lesions along the renal sympathetic nerves that help regulate blood pressure. The lesions disrupt the nerve supply to decrease systolic blood pressure, which is the top number in a reading. St Jude also plans to release study data on the safety and effectiveness of the device on Wednesday at a medical meeting in Paris. Medtronic in January 2011 completed the acquisition of Ardian Inc, which already has a renal denervation system on the market in Europe. Medtronic paid $800 million upfront for the privately held company and agreed to make further payments tied to revenue growth. Covidien’s OneShot renal denervation system received European regulatory clearance in February, and Frankfurt-based ReCor Medical also won approval for its device in February. Privately held Vessix Vascular Inc of Laguna Hills, California, announced earlier this month that it received European approval for a renal denervation system. JPMorgan analyst Michael Weinstein said St Jude’s European product launch comes several months ahead of expectations and should help draw investor attention away from recent headlines on failure rates for some St Jude heart defibrillator lead wires. Cardiac rhythm management (CRM) products such as implanted defibrillators are now St Jude’s biggest market. “While CRM dominates the headlines, the real story and future at St Jude is its pipeline outside of CRM,” Weinstein wrote in a note to clients. Shares of St Jude fell 2 percent to close at $38.89 on the New York Stock Exchange.",5152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/stjude/st-jude-is-latest-to-launch-blood-pressure-device-idUSL1E8GFCVB20120515

82,MDT,"Medtronic net up, but weak spine-product sales weigh","(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) reported higher quarterly earnings on Tuesday, but shares fell on disappointment over continued weakness in its key market for spine products. The world’s largest maker of medical devices forecast higher earnings and revenue for the new fiscal year, in line with analysts’ estimates. “I think people were hoping for better guidance, not just at the (average)forecast,” said Michael Matson, an analyst with Mizuho Securities USA. He also said the quarterly results were boosted by a lower tax rate, adding that this is not an ideal way to beat expectations. Its shares were down 1.6 percent to $37.09 in afternoon trading. Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis told a conference call that analysts’ earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter, begun April 28, were too high. “For whatever reason, the consensus has (earnings up) 10 percent in the first quarter and 2 percent in the fourth quarter,” Ellis said in a telephone interview. “A few cents need to be shifted around.” Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said he saw more stable market conditions ahead for Medtronic’s key products, including implantable heart defibrillators and pacemakers, heart stents and products used in spinal surgery. While certain products in the spine division will continue to be a drag, management still has hope the division’s performance will improve. “We are asking, ‘What are the issues in this market?’ rather than just giving up on it,” said Ishrak, who was also interviewed by Reuters by phone. “Overall, the spine market is still a good market,” Ellis added. “We’re changing our strategy to get back market leadership.” Medtronic’s spine business generated 21 percent of the company’s total revenue in fiscal 2012. The company also said it plans to wring out $1 billion of costs over the next five years. Cutting costs out of manufacturing is a key initiative, Ishrak said. Research and development costs should remain relatively steady around 9 percent of sales, and management said it did not expect a reduction in net headcount at the company. The company, he said, would be shifting resources. In the latest quarter, it took at $118 million pretax charge for a restructuring that would eliminate 1,000 positions, but it would add at least as many jobs in emerging markets. Medtronic expects earnings of $3.62 to $3.70 per share in the current fiscal year, on revenue growth of 2 percent to 4 percent from $16.18 billion last year. On average, analysts’ average forecast for fiscal 2013 is $3.66 per share on revenue of $16.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the fourth quarter, ended April 27, net earnings were $991 million, or 94 cents per share, compared with $776 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 99 cents per share, a penny above the analysts’ average estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $4.3 billion from $4.1 billion on stronger sales of insulin pumps, heart valves and heart stents. Its spine division continued to struggle with weak demand, particularly for its Infuse product, a bone graft paste that is used in spinal surgery. The product’s safety was questioned last year by a medical journal that said the company failed to disclose payments to doctors who authored studies on the product. Earlier this month, Medtronic said the U.S. government had closed its investigation into Infuse. Implantable heart defibrillator sales slipped, but not as much as expected, and the company said it expects these sales to be flat to slightly lower in the current fiscal year. Derrick Sung, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said he now estimates the U.S. market declined 6 percent in calendar year 2012, with Medtronic and competitor St Jude Medical Inc STJ.N growing faster than the overall market.

88,MDT,"Medtronic heart device sales stabilize, but disappoint","(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) said sales of its heart defibrillators outpaced the global industry but remained weak, disappointing some investors who hoped the company would win more business after a product recall from rival St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N. Medtronic, the world’s largest stand-alone maker of medical devices, said the global market for implantable defibrillators, known as ICDs, was beginning to stabilize after several sluggish years due to a weak economy and heightened scrutiny over their use. The devices, which correct irregular heart rhythms, are one of its biggest revenue-generators. Chief Executive Omar Ishrak estimated the total worldwide market for the devices fell 4 percent in the latest quarter. Medtronic performed slightly better, with company defibrillator sales down 3 percent. “We’re pretty satisfied with what we’re doing in ICDs. Our share in Europe is at a three-year high,” Ishrak said in an interview. “We are gaining share. We can’t say whether it’s because of (St. Jude’s issues). And we feel good about the fact that the market is stabilizing,” he said. Medtronic shares were down 0.2 percent at $41.35 on Tuesday afternoon. Earlier in the day the shares rose to $41.75, the highest level since mid-2011. Danielle Antalffy, an analyst with Leerink Swann, attributed the modest stock decline to disappointment that the company did not benefit more from the problems that rival St. Jude has had with its defibrillator leads - the wires that carry electricity from the device to the heart. “We are seeing signs of improvement. Maybe the improvement wasn’t quite as good as people had hoped,” said Debbie Wang, an analyst with Morningstar. In the United States, Ishrak said that the ratio of the number of leads sold to the number of defibrillators sold has rebounded to the levels before the company recalled its Fidelis lead in 2009. The ratio is one indicator of doctors’ willingness to use Medtronic leads with Medtronic’s defibrillators. Separately, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it had sent a warning letter to Medtronic in July. The letter said that some neurological devices manufactured at its Minnesota plant violated manufacturing and quality regulations, which could lead to patient injuries, and that the company needs to take immediate action to correct the problems. Ishrak said he does not expect that corrections at the plant will have a material financial impact and that the company would work as quickly as possible to fix the problems. Medtronic, which also makes heart pacemakers, insulin pumps and products used for spinal procedures, said net earnings for its fiscal first quarter ended July 27 rose to $864 million, or 83 cents per share, from $821 million, or 77 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 85 cents per share, matching the average Wall Street estimate, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased to $4.01 billion from $3.95 billion. The company left its full-year profit forecast unchanged at $3.62 to $3.70 per share. “We want to be very conservative,” Ishrak said. In the latest quarter, emerging-market revenue made up 11 percent of Medtronic’s overall sales in the quarter, well below the company’s goal of 20 percent. Ishrak called the result a disappointment. “It was more execution than the market,” he said, adding that emerging market governments continue to invest in healthcare, and Medtronic’s 20 percent goal remains intact. Revenue from its cardiac rhythm management unit fell 5 percent to $1.19 billion as hospitals purchased fewer devices, instead using those already on their shelves. Revenue from its Restorative Therapies Group, including its spine, neuromodulation, diabetes and surgical technologies businesses, rose 5 percent to $1.89 billion.

98,MDT,Kids' surgery uses bone products not approved for children,"* Products used in spine surgery for nearly 1 in 10 kids * Health risks not clear, product use adds $4,000 to hospital bills * Medtronic, Stryker are main manufacturers By Frederik Joelving NEW YORK, Oct 9 (Reuters Health) - Nearly one in ten U.S. children undergoing spine fusion surgery get injections with bioengineered bone-growth proteins that have not been approved for that use by health regulators, researchers have found. So-called “off-label” use of medical therapies is legal, but has triggered concerns because its risks and benefits are not well understood. What’s more, the orthopedic products add more than $4,000 in hospital charges for the surgery, according to a new study published on Tuesday in Journal of the American Medical Association. “It is expensive, we don’t know if it’s effective, and we don’t know what the long-term implications are,” said Dr. Emily Dodwell, a surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, who led the research. Bone-growth proteins speed up bone formation and have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for limited use in adults. They have a troubled history. Last year, a medical journal determined that doctors who were paid millions of dollars by Minneapolis-based Medtronic Inc  had failed to report serious complications linked to the company’s product Infuse, also known as bone morphogenetic protein-2 or BMP-2. Those complications include increased cancer risk, sterility in men, infections, bone dissolution and worsened back and leg pain, among others. While it’s unclear whether children would experience similar side effects, a particular concern is how BMPs would interact with a still-growing skeleton, Dodwell told Reuters Health. Her study did not identify specific products. There are also no good data on whether or not the products help youngsters, who are less likely to have healing problems than adults after spine surgeries, according to the new report. At about 4,100 hospitals that are part of the national registry studied by the researchers, 9.2 percent of more than 8,000 spine fusions in people 18 years and younger involved BMPs. “Most people would feel this is a high number,” Dodwell noted, although she stopped short of saying BMP should never be used in minors. In cases where BMP was used, patients’ hospital bills amounted to $47,136 on average, compared to $43,126 when surgeons didn’t use the product. There was no difference in the number of complications seen during the hospital stay in the two groups, although Dodwell and her colleagues cautioned that long-term complications are the main concern. She said her team is currently analyzing data from another registry to see how kids fare after they leave the hospital. The researchers also found that doctors more frequently used BMP in the Midwest, which is home to Medtronic. Medtronic officials could not be immediately reached for comment.",10092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-health-spinesurgery/kids-surgery-uses-bone-products-not-approved-for-children-idUSL1E8L9IWM20121009
99,MDT,Medtronic edited doctor reviews for product: Senate report,"(Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Inc edited health journal articles and paid doctors millions of dollars for company-sponsored studies of its Infuse bone-grafting product used in spinal surgery, according to a U.S. Senate report published on Thursday. There were questionable ties between Medtronic and physician consultants who tested and reviewed the company’s product, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee said in the report, which concludes a 16-month investigation covering 5,000 documents relating to 13 studies of Infuse. Medtronic paid about $210 million in royalties and consulting fees to the authors of company-sponsored studies between November 1996 and December 2010, the report said. Those sponsored studies failed to mention complications from the product, including male sterility, an increased risk of cancer, infections, bone dissolution and worsened back and leg pain. “The company’s significant role in authoring or substantively editing these articles was not disclosed in the published articles. Medical journals should ensure industry role contributions be fully disclosed,” the committee’s report said. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican and senior member of the committee, said in a statement: “The findings also should prompt medical journals to take a very proactive approach to accounting for the content of the articles, along with the authorship of the articles and studies they feature.” The Senate committee, which has sole jurisdiction over U.S. government health programs Medicare and Medicaid, accused the company of wrongly promoting Infuse, a genetically engineered protein used in spinal surgery, as a better technique than bone grafts from the pelvis. In response, Medtronic said in a statement on its website it “vigorously disagreed” with the allegations of influencing or authoring the publications or under-reporting adverse events. “In addition, the report’s characterization of payments received by physicians is also misleading and unfair,” Medtronic said. The inquiry by the Senate Committee began in June last year, investigating whether surgeons paid by Medtronic did not report complications associated with Infuse. The Spine Journal reported at that time that 13 Medtronic-sponsored studies related to Infuse had reported no adverse events. “While the report confirms what was reported in the June 2011 issue of The Spine Journal, the committee’s access to Medtronic’s internal documents presents a more detailed and disturbing picture of what can go wrong when ethics and patient safety are compromised for profit,” the North American Spine Society said in a statement. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Infuse in 2002 to stimulate spinal bone growth in patients with a degenerative disease affecting the lower spine. However, the product is used mostly off-label, often for repairs to the cervical, or neck, spinal area. According to Medtronic, Infuse has been used to treat more than 500,000 patients and generated sales of about $800 million in fiscal 2011. Robin Young, whose firm RRY Publications publishes Orthopedics This Week, said he believes Medtronic, which makes a host of other non-orthopedic medical devices, has improved its practices substantially in recent years. “Medtronic went through strict compliance changes. It was a top-to-bottom commitment to compliance, with wholesale changes. It’s a multi-year process and a change of culture, and it’s much different than it was even seven years ago,” Young said. Shares of Medtronic were trading at $41.97, up 28 cents, in early activity on the New York Stock Exchange.

102,MDT,Edwards Lifesciences wins appeal in Medtronic patent fight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Edwards Lifesciences LLC Corp won a round in a patent fight with Medtronic Inc’s CoreValve unit on Tuesday as a federal appeals court upheld a $74 million lower court judgment involving infringement of patented heart valve technology. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said on Tuesday it was upholding a decision by a federal court in Delaware that Medtronic’s device infringed a patent owned by Edwards. The court awarded $74 million in lost profits and royalties. The device in question is an artificial heart valve that can be implanted without resorting to open heart surgery. But the district court declined to issue an order banning sales of Medtronic’s infringing product, and the appeals court sent the case back to the lower court to reconsider the denial of the injunction. Medtronic said in a brief statement that it disagreed with the appeals court decision and was evaluating its next steps. Its product is not on the market in this country but is sold elsewhere. Edwards said in a statement that it intended to demand additional damages in the Delaware court because of the finding that the infringement was willful. If infringement is found to be willful, a court may triple the damage award. “We believe this is a decisive milestone toward final resolution of this matter, given that we have a clear jury verdict that has been affirmed by both the district court and now the U.S. court of appeals,” said Aimee S. Weisner, Edwards’ general counsel in a statement. In early October, Edwards cut its revenue forecast for the third quarter, as sales of its unique heart valve that was expected to drive results fell short of estimates. Edwards estimated total revenue of about $448 million for the quarter that ended September 30, down from its previous outlook of between $465 million to $485 million.

105,MDT,Medtronic shares jump on signs its markets are improving,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N), the world’s largest maker of medical devices, reported lower quarterly earnings as legal and other expenses ate into profits, but signs that its key heart and spine markets were stabilizing sent its shares higher on Tuesday. Medtronic, a maker of implantable heart pacemakers and defibrillators, insulin pumps and devices used in spinal surgery, said its net earnings were $646 million, or 63 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter that ended October 26, down from $871 million, or 82 cents per share in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 88 cents per share, matching analysts’ average forecast. Quarterly revenue increased 2 percent to $4.095 billion. Yet revenue from its two biggest businesses, heart rhythm management and spine, was flat to lower. The bright spot in the quarter was provided by indications that these two markets - which together make up about half of its total revenue - were stabilizing, said Chief Executive Omar Ishrak in a telephone interview. “Signs of stabilization in (cardiac rhythm management) and spine have been encouraging. In those markets, we have gained share,” he said. Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management revenue, which includes sales of pacemakers and defibrillators, was flat at $1.23 billion, excluding the impact of foreign currency, or down 3 percent including the currency impact. Sales of implantable heart defibrillators were the highest they have been in 10 quarters and sales of leads rebounded to levels not seen since the company recalled its Fidelis lead 5 years ago. Spine revenue was $782 million in the quarter, 5 percent lower excluding foreign currency translations, or down 7 percent including the currency impact. Ishrak said his biggest disappointment in the quarter was China’s results. “Chinese growth was 11 percent.. That could have been better,” he said. Medtronic’s recent acquisition of Chinese orthopedics device maker Kanghui Holdings should help bolster growth, he added. The company reiterated its outlook for earnings of $3.62 to $3.70 per diluted share for fiscal 2013. The company said it expects revenue growth of 3 percent to 4 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency for fiscal 2013. The company had previously provided a revenue growth outlook of 2 percent to 4 percent. Ishrak characterized the outlook as conservative, noting there are many uncertainties in the United States and in Europe that could trip up the company’s performance in the remainder of its fiscal year. He expressed concern about a decline in medical procedures in Europe, the potential for pricing pressure on its medical devices, the possibility of sequestration and the impact of the Affordable Care Act in the United States. “There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Ishrak said. Analyst Jeff Jonas of Gabelli Health and Wellness Trust Mutual Fund, which owns Medtronic shares, called the quarter “solid” and sees the company as being conservative in its forecast. “They are not assuming anything gets better in the second half (of Medtronic’s fiscal year),” he said. Josh Jennings, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said the outlook is reasonable given all of the challenges around the world, including a slowdown in economic activity in Europe and the United States, which would likely lead to fewer medical procedures. “The two anchors that have been pulling down top-line performance are spine and the ICD franchise....and declines in those divisions are moderating and that should continue,” said Jennings, who has an “outperform” rating on Medtronic shares. Medtronic shares were up 57 cents to $42.38 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

In those markets, we have gained share,” he said. Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management revenue, which includes sales of pacemakers and defibrillators, was flat at $1.23 billion, excluding the impact of foreign currency, or down 3 percent including the currency impact. Sales of implantable heart defibrillators were the highest they have been in 10 quarters and sales of leads rebounded to levels not seen since the company recalled its Fidelis lead 5 years ago. Spine revenue was $782 million in the quarter, 5 percent lower excluding foreign currency translations, or down 7 percent including the currency impact. Ishrak said his biggest disappointment in the quarter was China’s results. “Chinese growth was 11 percent.. That could have been better,” he said. Medtronic’s recent acquisition of Chinese orthopedics device maker Kanghui Holdings should help bolster growth, he added. The company reiterated its outlook for earnings of $3.62 to $3.70 per diluted share for fiscal 2013. The company said it expects revenue growth of 3 percent to 4 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency for fiscal 2013. The company had previously provided a revenue growth outlook of 2 percent to 4 percent. Ishrak characterized the outlook as conservative, noting there are many uncertainties in the United States and in Europe that could trip up the company’s performance in the remainder of its fiscal year. He expressed concern about a decline in medical procedures in Europe, the potential for pricing pressure on its medical devices, the possibility of sequestration and the impact of the Affordable Care Act in the United States. “There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Ishrak said. Analyst Jeff Jonas of Gabelli Health and Wellness Trust Mutual Fund, which owns Medtronic shares, called the quarter “solid” and sees the company as being conservative in its forecast. “They are not assuming anything gets better in the second half (of Medtronic’s fiscal year),” he said. Josh Jennings, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said the outlook is reasonable given all of the challenges around the world, including a slowdown in economic activity in Europe and the United States, which would likely lead to fewer medical procedures. “The two anchors that have been pulling down top-line performance are spine and the ICD franchise....and declines in those divisions are moderating and that should continue,” said Jennings, who has an “outperform” rating on Medtronic shares.

108,MDT,"Medtronic, Pew urge quick adoption of medical 'sunshine' rule","* Rule requires disclosure of manufacturers’ ties to doctors, hospitals * Medtronic, Pew want final rule adopted before Jan. 1 * Delays spawn concern about unnecessary costs, confusion WASHINGTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - A major U.S. medical device maker and a leading public interest group are urging the U.S. government to move quickly to adopt a new rule requiring manufacturers to disclose their financial ties to physicians and teaching hospitals. The so-called “sunshine” provision, part of President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law, has widespread support among industry and consumer groups. But advocates say lengthy delays in implementation are threatening to hamper its effectiveness with unnecessary costs and confusion. “Many companies have already invested significant resources in preparing to comply with the sunshine provision,” representatives from Medtronic Inc and the Pew Charitable Trusts said in a November 16 letter to Marilyn Tavenner, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. “We request that final regulations be released no later than December of this year,” the letter said. CMS officials were not immediately available to comment. The agency, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, helping to spearhead implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Pew released the letter on Wednesday, a day after the White House Office of Management and Budget began reviewing the final version of the regulation. A preliminary version was published December 19, 2011. OMB is the final stop in the federal rule-making process before regulations are finalized. The sunshine rule would require manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by federal healthcare programs to report annually their payments and gifts to physicians or teaching hospitals. Its objective is to avoid conflicts of interest that could influence research or care-delivery decisions to the detriment of clinical integrity and patients. “Full implementation of this law will protect patients and help restore trust in our healthcare system,” said the letter co-authored by Medtronic’s ethics chief, Thomas Schumacher, and Pew’s medical programs director, Allan Coukell. The healthcare law required the administration to establish reporting procedures for manufacturers by October 1, 2011. The original deadlines also called for companies to begin collecting payment information on January 1, 2012, and submit the data to HHS by March 31, 2013. “Delays in establishing procedures for the submission and public reporting of the required information have made these deadlines unfeasible,” the letter noted.",11282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-sunshine/medtronic-pew-urge-quick-adoption-of-medical-sunshine-rule-idUSL1E8MSEHD20121128
109,MDT,Medtronic sees fiscal 2013 EPS up 6-7 percent,"(Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) said on Monday that fiscal 2013 earnings will be at the upper end of its previously forecast range, boosted by a research tax credit, for an annual growth rate of 6 percent to 7 percent. Medtronic expects 2013 earnings, excluding charges, of $3.66 to $3.70 a share, compared with its previous forecast of $3.62 to $3.70 a share. Analysts, on average, expected $3.65 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Medtronic, which provided the update in conjunction with a presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, estimated the tax credit will boost full-year earnings by $30 million to $35 million, or 4 cents a share. It expects about 3 cents in the third quarter and 1 cent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.

112,MDT,Medtronic profit up; shares fall on weak demand in Europe,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) reported higher quarterly earnings on Tuesday, but sales of key heart and spine devices fell and overall European sales weakened in January, sending the company’s shares down nearly 3 percent. Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis attributed the decline in Medtronic’s stock to management’s comments about Europe. “The stock had been running up recently,” he told Reuters. “But in January, we saw a significant kind of change in Europe. (Today) was the first time we communicated that to the investment community.” Ellis could not point to any policy change in Europe to explain the weak markets there. European markets generate about a quarter of Medtronic’s total revenue. Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak characterized the quarter as “challenging.” He noted, however, that there were signs of improvement in the company’s largest businesses - cardiac rhythm management and spine - partly because of an increase in procedures, and also because Medtronic took share in those markets. There is still price pressure, especially in the cardiac rhythm management, he said, but he expects that to subside as Medtronic launches new implantable defibrillators and pacemakers this year. Medtronic, which also makes heart stents, heart valves, and insulin, reiterated its outlook for the fiscal year, calling for diluted earnings per share of $3.66 to $3.70 on revenue growth of 3 percent to 4 percent. The company said its net earnings increased to $988 million, or 97 cents per diluted share, in the third quarter ended on January 25 from $935 million, or 88 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, mainly related to acquisitions, earnings were 93 cents per share. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting 91 cents.

120,MDT,Medtronic profit beats estimates as international sales jump,"(Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by strong international sales, a lower tax rate and demand for new heart stent products, sending its shares up 5 percent in late-morning trading. Medtronic has been expanding in fast-growing emerging markets such as China and India to offset lower demand in the United States. In its home market, more Americans are struggling to pay for healthcare in a weak economy, demand for many medical procedures has slowed, and hospitals have pushed back hard on pricing for medical devices. Medtronic, whose products range from insulin pumps to implantable heart defibrillators to brain stimulation devices, said its core heart and spinal device markets were stabilizing. Chief Executive Omar Ishrak, on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, said the company maintained or increased its market share in almost all of its businesses in the latest quarter. “We are optimistic this stabilization should continue as we roll out our new products,” Ishrak said. The medical device markets in which the company competes are growing 1 percent to 3 percent annually overall, the CEO said in an interview. “The markets are not growing at the pace we’ve shown that we can grow. So obviously we are taking share,” Ishrak said. He emphasized the company is committed to delivering consistent growth going forward. Minneapolis-based Medtronic’s net earnings were $969 million, or 95 cents per share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended April 26, compared with $991 million, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, it earned $1.10 per share. On that basis, analysts on average had expected $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Medtronic said it took restructuring charges for manufacturing consolidation and the elimination of 2,000 jobs worldwide, primarily in its spine and cardiac and vascular groups. Net sales rose 4 percent to $4.46 billion, with revenue from emerging markets jumping 13 percent to $521 million. Sales of drug-eluting stents increased 22 percent on a constant-currency basis, driven by share gains for the Resolute Integrity product. “Across the board, it looks like it was a pretty good quarter,” said Aaron Vaughn, an analyst with Mid-Continent Capital, which has $1.9 billion under management and does not own Medtronic shares. Sales of implantable heart defibrillators increased 1.5 percent to $755 million, while sales of pacemaker systems rose 3 percent to $505 million. Sales of spinal products fell 1 percent to $811 million. Goldman Sachs analyst David Roman said solid defibrillator sales were a primary driver of strength in the quarter, with Medtronic gaining market share from rivals overseas, helped by new product launches. Medtronic said it was working to resolve deficiencies in quality systems in the manufacture of its insulin pumps, identified recently by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration during an inspection. The issues are delaying the launch of its next-generation insulin pump. The company is also addressing a previously disclosed FDA warning letter regarding its neuromodulation business. Medtronic forecast fiscal 2014 earnings of $3.80 to $3.85 per share and revenue growth of 3 percent to 4 percent on a constant-currency basis. Analysts on average have forecast earnings of $3.84 a share. The company’s shares rose $2.66 to $52.55 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

122,MDT,Medtronic takes 'first step' toward U.S. sale of artificial pancreas,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Type 1 diabetics, who run the risk of dangerously low blood sugar, may be a step closer to getting help from a crude artificial pancreas device that can read blood sugar levels and automatically turn off the flow of insulin after a clinical trial showed the device is safe. The long-awaited results of the clinical trial may pave the way for U.S. approval of the device, made by Medtronic, which already sells insulin pumps with an automatic shutoff feature in 50 countries outside the United States. The feature is meant to guard against delivering insulin to diabetics their blood sugar is already too low. As many as 3 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, in which the immune system destroys cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes must monitor their blood sugar and take insulin several times a day. Too little insulin can cause high blood sugar, increasing the risk of long-term complications such as eye damage, kidney failure and heart disease. But too much insulin can cause blood sugar to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia, which can result in seizures, unconsciousness, brain damage and death. U.S. regulators have refused to allow insulin pumps with an automatic shutoff feature on the U.S. market without a large, carefully controlled clinical trial proving they are safe. The latest study, known as ASPIRE, which tested the system in 247 people with diabetes in their homes, offered the proof. It showed the device reduced the amount of time and the duration that a diabetic’s blood sugar fell below a certain threshold - a measure known as area under the curve - by 37.5 percent. The device reduced the overall number of low blood sugar episodes by 31.8 percent compared to diabetics using an insulin pump without the shutoff feature. The findings were published online on Saturday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Chicago. Dr. Francine Kaufman, vice president of global medical affairs for Medtronic’s diabetes business, said the study showed that shutting off the flow of insulin mimics what happens in healthy people in response to low blood sugar. Kaufman, a pediatric endocrinologist who still has an active practice in Los Angeles, said the device is intended to help diabetics who may find themselves in a situation where they cannot help themselves. “Many of my patients are 3 years old. So, if mom is not around, they don’t know how to do this on their own,” she said. “We’re going to take that and automate it for them.” Dr Richard Bergenstal, of the International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet Health Services in Minneapolis, the study’s lead author, highlighted the study’s findings. “That is a significant reduction in the duration and severity of low blood sugar,” he told a news briefing at the diabetes meeting. Diabetes advocates, researchers and medical device companies for decades have spoken wistfully about the “holy grail” of an artificial pancreas, a complex system of pumps and sensors aimed at automating the complex care and treatment of type 1 diabetes by mimicking the function of a real pancreas. The Medtronic device is decidedly not that. But it is the first device before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to detect dangerous blood sugar levels and automatically take action to correct it. “The study results are important as we continue to move toward our goal of developing a fully automated system, or artificial pancreas, that will one day require very minimal interaction from the patient,” Medtronic’s Kaufman said. In designing the study, researchers had to find a population of patients who were especially prone to having hypoglycemia at night. Bergenstal said as many as 320 people tried to enroll in the study, but only 247 qualified. Spears Mallis, a 34-year-old administrator for the Longstreet Cancer Center in Gainesville, Georgia, was one. Mallis, an avid runner, has had type 1 diabetes for almost 17 years. For the past 16 or so, he has used an insulin pump, often pared with a continuous glucose monitor, to keep track of his blood sugar and deliver a steady flow of insulin. But Mallis still suffers from occasional bouts of hypoglycemia, which were especially disturbing when he had a job that required him to travel. Like many in the diabetes community, Mallis was aware of efforts several years ago by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and others to push the FDA to set guidelines for approving the Medtronic device. Some had even hoped the agency would allow these devices on the U.S. market without additional testing. But in 2011, the FDA made clear the company would need a clinical trial, and Mallis was on board. During the three-month trial, Mallis said the suspend device kicked in several times. “In one of my races, it went off and I had it go straight to suspend.” He said the device’s alarm feature was loud enough to wake his wife, but there were times he would sleep through it. “After you have type 1 diabetes for awhile, your senses become lessened for feeling low blood sugar.” Mallis said the device would stop the flow of insulin until he woke and took action himself. His experience was typical. Bergenstal said for many individuals, the device was suspended for the full two-hour maximum, despite the alarm. “They didn’t wake up.” The study was also designed to see if cutting off insulin for this period would cause insulin to “rocket back up,” Bergenstal said. But at the end of the two-hour period, it just “gradually drifted back up into the normal range,” he said. The study also showed the device had no impact on a measure of long-term control of blood sugar called A1c. Kaufman said Medtronic has presented the study results to the FDA and received an approvable letter for its next-generation pump device that includes the feature, meaning the device can be approved provided the company meets certain conditions. Chief Executive Omar Ishrak has said he expects device approval during the current calendar year. “We are just going back and forth on overall quality issues. We’re working very collaboratively with FDA to work through some of the issues,” Kaufman said. Meanwhile, the company and its rivals, including Johnson & Johnson’s Animas unit, are working on next-generation devices that add more automated features. On Friday, the company presented results at the diabetes meeting on a study of a system designed to predict when diabetics are heading for a dangerous low and take preemptive action by decreasing the amount of insulin the pump delivers. The night-time study of 20 adults with type 1 diabetes showed the software control program helped people stay within a target range for 90 percent of the time. Ramakrishna Venugopalan, director for research and development at Animas, sees the development of an artificial pancreas as a step-wise process, in which products begin to automate more and more of the functions now managed by patients. The company this month won approval for another feasibility study, its third in three years. Venugopalan still can’t say when a fully automated artificial pancreas will be available, but adds, “I don’t think this is a pipe dream.” ",6222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-diabetes-device-medtronic/medtronic-takes-first-step-toward-u-s-sale-of-artificial-pancreas-idUSBRE95L08X20130622

Diabetes advocates, researchers and medical device companies for decades have spoken wistfully about the “holy grail” of an artificial pancreas, a complex system of pumps and sensors aimed at automating the complex care and treatment of type 1 diabetes by mimicking the function of a real pancreas. The Medtronic device is decidedly not that. But it is the first device before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to detect dangerous blood sugar levels and automatically take action to correct it. “The study results are important as we continue to move toward our goal of developing a fully automated system, or artificial pancreas, that will one day require very minimal interaction from the patient,” Medtronic’s Kaufman said. In designing the study, researchers had to find a population of patients who were especially prone to having hypoglycemia at night. Bergenstal said as many as 320 people tried to enroll in the study, but only 247 qualified. Spears Mallis, a 34-year-old administrator for the Longstreet Cancer Center in Gainesville, Georgia, was one. Mallis, an avid runner, has had type 1 diabetes for almost 17 years. For the past 16 or so, he has used an insulin pump, often pared with a continuous glucose monitor, to keep track of his blood sugar and deliver a steady flow of insulin. But Mallis still suffers from occasional bouts of hypoglycemia, which were especially disturbing when he had a job that required him to travel. Like many in the diabetes community, Mallis was aware of efforts several years ago by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and others to push the FDA to set guidelines for approving the Medtronic device. Some had even hoped the agency would allow these devices on the U.S. market without additional testing. But in 2011, the FDA made clear the company would need a clinical trial, and Mallis was on board. During the three-month trial, Mallis said the suspend device kicked in several times. “In one of my races, it went off and I had it go straight to suspend.” He said the device’s alarm feature was loud enough to wake his wife, but there were times he would sleep through it.  “After you have type 1 diabetes for awhile, your senses become lessened for feeling low blood sugar.” Mallis said the device would stop the flow of insulin until he woke and took action himself. His experience was typical. Bergenstal said for many individuals, the device was suspended for the full two-hour maximum, despite the alarm. “They didn’t wake up.” The study was also designed to see if cutting off insulin for this period would cause insulin to “rocket back up,” Bergenstal said. But at the end of the two-hour period, it just “gradually drifted back up into the normal range,” he said. The study also showed the device had no impact on a measure of long-term control of blood sugar called A1c. Kaufman said Medtronic has presented the study results to the FDA and received an approvable letter for its next-generation pump device that includes the feature, meaning the device can be approved provided the company meets certain conditions. Chief Executive Omar Ishrak has said he expects device approval during the current calendar year. “We are just going back and forth on overall quality issues. We’re working very collaboratively with FDA to work through some of the issues,” Kaufman said. Meanwhile, the company and its rivals, including Johnson & Johnson’s Animas unit, are working on next-generation devices that add more automated features. On Friday, the company presented results at the diabetes  meeting on a study of a system designed to predict when diabetics are heading for a dangerous low and take preemptive action by decreasing the amount of insulin the pump delivers. The night-time study of 20 adults with type 1 diabetes showed the software control program helped people stay within a target range for 90 percent of the time. Ramakrishna Venugopalan, director for research and development at Animas, sees the development of an artificial pancreas as a step-wise process, in which products begin to automate more and more of the functions now managed by patients. The company this month won approval for another feasibility study, its third in three years. Venugopalan still can’t say when a fully automated artificial pancreas will be available, but adds, “I don’t think this is a pipe dream.”",6222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/diabetes-device-medtronic/medtronic-takes-1st-step-toward-u-s-sale-of-artificial-pancreas-idUSL2N0EX1MF20130622
124,MDT,UPDATE 1-Medtronic loses heart valve patent fight in Germany,"By Sakthi Prasad July 12 (Reuters) - A German court ruled against Medtronic Inc in the latest round of its patent fight with Edwards Lifesciences on Friday, judging the U.S. medical device maker’s transcatheter heart valve technology infringes a patent owned by Edwards. Shares of Edwards were up 3.7 percent at $68.25 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Medtronic were down 1.4 percent at $53.01. The German court decision immediately bars sales of Medtronic’s CoreValve and CoreValve Evolut systems in that country, requires their recall from the market and payment of damages. “Germany is the second largest market for transcatheter valves outside of the U.S.,” said Jefferies & Co analyst Raj Denhoy. The Medtronic devices are not yet being sold in the United States, where Edwards is pursuing patient litigation to  keep its competitor from entering the market. Medtronic said in a statement that it “respectfully disagrees” with the Mannheim court’s decision and intends to appeal. The validity of the patent, known as the Spenser patent, is also being contested at the European patent office. The artificial valves, threaded into the heart with a catheter through an artery, are designed to spare patients from chest cracking, open heart surgery. In November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said it was upholding a decision by a federal court in Delaware that Medtronic’s device infringed a patent owned by Edwards. The court awarded $74 million in lost profits and royalties. Medtronic said its revenue from the affected products in Germany was less than 0.5 percent of its total revenue in fiscal year 2013, while reiterating its revenue and earnings outlook for fiscal year 2014. The company said it continues to expect full-year revenue growth in the range of 3 to 4 percent on a constant currency basis and earnings in the range of $3.80 to $3.85 per share. Analysts, on an average, were expecting full-year earnings of $3.84 per share, on revenue of $16.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The European market for transcatheter heart valves currently totals about $600 million a year, and Germany is about 40 percent of that, Denhoy said. Heart disease is the world’s No. 1 killer. An estimated 500,000 Americans suffer from severely diseased heart valves, according to the American Heart Association.",7122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-edwardslifesciences-patent/update-1-medtronic-loses-heart-valve-patent-fight-in-germany-idUSL1N0FI0Z320130712

127,MDT,Medtronic aims to help countries build healthcare systems,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) wants to sell more than medical devices in emerging markets. The company is looking to help countries such as China and India develop their healthcare systems and has targeted two areas where it can provide its expertise, disease management and hospital efficiency, Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said in an interview. Expansion in developing countries is a top priority for the device maker, which is coping with slow U.S. sales of everything from pacemakers to insulin pumps as intensifying pressures to rein in healthcare spending take a toll on the once high-flying industry. Medtronic has aggressive goals for sales in emerging markets, aiming to increase revenue growth in those regions to 20 percent from the current 15 percent. To do that, it is establishing itself as a healthcare adviser. “To realize economic value, we have to go beyond the procedure itself,” Ishrak said. The company is already working with administrators in Europe to help hospitals find ways to operate more efficiently, by developing new financing models and purchasing strategies and outsourcing certain functions, he said. “We have contracts with hospitals now and a pipeline of many more that are interested in those efforts,” Ishrak said. How to organize patients before surgery, shorten stays in an intensive care unit and perform procedures better are among the areas in which Medtronic has expertise, he said. Medtronic will initially focus on countries in central Europe and the Middle East, where hospitals are being built at a fairly rapid pace, Ishrak said. “The administrators there are looking for help in setting up those hospitals as soon as possible,” he said. He expects eventually to work with systems in Southeast Asia and India as well. Ishrak said he supports effort by U.S. hospitals to develop new business models that provide financial incentives for improving care and lowering costs. He said he believes the U.S. healthcare system is transitioning from the traditional “fee-for-service” method of paying doctors for every test, procedure and office visit. “The quicker we move to pay-for-value and disease management, the more quickly we can realize high-quality, low-cost healthcare in the United States,” the CEO said. As a medical device maker, Medtronic adds value when its technologies help reduce hospital readmissions and visits to the emergency room, Ishrak said.

128,MDT,Medtronic shares slump on soft first-quarter defibrillator sales,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) on Tuesday reported a first-quarter profit in line with expectations on solid growth in emerging markets, but soft U.S. demand for implantable heart defibrillators weighed on its shares, which slumped more than 2 percent. Revenue in the quarter came in below analysts’ estimates, dragged down by a 3 percent decline in sales of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), a key product line. Competitors Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N had better ICD sales, raising expectations for Medtronic, analysts said. ICDs use electrical pulses to help control life-threatening irregular heartbeats. The company, whose products range from pacemakers and stents to insulin pumps and brain stimulation devices, reiterated its outlook for both sales and profit for the fiscal year. Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said on a conference call that new ICDs, pacemakers and spinal devices to be launched in the coming quarters would bolster results. Medtronic has focused on increasing its presence in faster-growth emerging markets like China, India and Latin America as the weak U.S. economy and efforts to reduce healthcare spending pressure the industry. “We are confident in both our outlook for the remainder of the year and our long-term competitive position in the changing healthcare environment,” Ishrak said. The Minneapolis-based company said net earnings rose to $953 million, or 93 cents per share, in the first quarter ended July 26, from $864 million, or 83 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding special items, Medtronic earned 88 cents a share, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 2 percent to $4.08 billion. Sales in emerging markets climbed 15 percent to $504 million. Overall sales of ICDs declined 3 percent to $655 million, but pacemaker sales were up 2 percent to $474 million. Sales of spinal products fell 3 percent to $765 million. Sales of its biologic bone-growth stimulator for spines declined 11 percent, hurt by the publication of an independent review that found its Infuse product was associated with a slightly increased risk of cancer. Infuse is a genetically engineered protein that is surgically placed where new bone is needed to stimulate growth and healing. On the call, Ishrak defended the product, saying the Yale University study provided further evidence that Infuse was a safe and effective treatment for approved indications. In addition, a separate analysis published in the online edition of the journal Spine found no cancer risk associated with the use of the product in spine fusion surgery. “Sales in the spinal business continue to deteriorate, where some people were expecting it to stabilize,” said Aaron Vaughn, an analyst with Mid-Continent Capital, which has $1.9 billion under management but does not own Medtronic shares. Vaughn said Medtronic’s results suggested U.S. demand for healthcare services is stable but not rebounding. Medtronic forecast fiscal 2014 earnings of $3.80 to $3.85 per share and revenue growth of 3 percent to 4 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Ishrak said Medtronic aims to generate 20 percent growth in emerging markets over the longer term as the regions become an increasingly important source of revenue. Medtronic shares fell $1.26, or 2.3 percent, to $52.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.

130,MDT,FDA panel supports broader use of Medtronic heart devices,"(Reuters) - A federal advisory panel recommended that Medtronic Inc be allowed to sell a line of implantable heart rhythm devices to a larger pool of patients, based on research showing the products lowered the risk of death and hospitalization. The panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted 4-3 on Tuesday to recommend approval for the products in patients who suffer from an abnormal heart rhythm called atrioventricular block. About one million Americans have atrioventricular block, which reduces heart function by blocking the electrical signals between its top and bottom chambers. The Medtronic products, called cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators and pacemakers, deliver electrical impulses to both lower chambers of the heart to restore its normal rhythm. Patients with atrioventricular block currently can receive a traditional pacemaker, which delivers impulses to the right ventricle only. Medtronic requested an expanded indication for its CRT-D (defibrillator) and CRT-P (pacemaker) devices based on results from a clinical study that showed a reduced risk of death or hospitalization for patients with atrioventricular block who get the products.

133,MDT,"Medtronic heart valve found to reduce death, stroke rate","(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s CoreValve heart valve implant significantly lowered death and stroke rates in frail, elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis who were considered too ill for surgery, according to data from a late-stage clinical trial. Medtronic is preparing to launch the product in the United States, pending regulatory approval. It will compete with Edwards Lifesciences’ Sapien heart valve, the only aortic valve replacement device currently on the U.S. market that can be implanted as an alternative to open-heart surgery. Medtronic said it expects to launch the product in the United States for use in extreme-risk patients before its fiscal year ends in April 2014, noting that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined it has sufficient information to evaluate the device. Shares of Medtronic closed up 1.5 percent on Tuesday, while those of rival heart valve maker Edwards Lifesciences fell 4.6 percent. Patients with aortic stenosis have decreased blood flow from the heart because the valve does not open properly, and they face a poor prognosis without treatment. The CoreValve implant is inserted through an artery, a less invasive alternative to traditional open-heart surgery in which the chest is cracked open and the heart valve replaced. In the CoreValve Extreme Risk study, the results of which were presented Tuesday at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics medical meeting in San Francisco, the Medtronic device met its primary goals for reducing mortality and stroke. The rate of death or major stroke after one year was 25.5 percent, significantly below the study’s goal of 43 percent, in the 471 patients treated with the valve. The average patient age was 83 years. “The fact that nearly three-quarters of patients were alive and free of strokes at one year is remarkable, given the complex medical conditions and extreme frailty of this population,” said Dr. Jeffrey Popma of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, a co-principal investigator of the study. CoreValve has been available in Europe since 2007 and competes with Edwards Lifesciences’ transcatheter valve in that market. The study presented on Tuesday provided a first look at U.S. data on Medtronic’s CoreValve system. Medtronic, which funded the study, said the FDA determined, after reviewing the study results, that it has enough information to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the device in extreme-risk patients without the need to convene an expert panel for additional input. “This is important as it accelerates the timeline for Medtronic’s U.S. approval from late 2014 to (first-half) 2014 and is an obvious positive for Medtronic and negative for Edwards,” J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein said in a note to clients. FDA will conduct a separate review of the product for use in less-ill patients who are deemed high risk, Medtronic said.

135,MDT,Top U.S. court hears arguments in pacemaker patent fight,"WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday heard arguments in a case of warring legal doctrines raised by a heart pacemaker patent fight between giant medical devices company Medtronic Inc and privately owned Mirowski Family Ventures LLC. The case stems from Medtronic’s decision to request a declaratory judgment that some of its pacemakers do not infringe on technology patented by Mirowski and licensed to Boston Scientific and Guidant Corp, part of Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories. Medtronic licensed the patents in question, but in 2007, Mirowski Family Ventures claimed Medtronic was developing new products that would justify royalty payments. Medtronic filed suit, seeking an adjudication that it did not need to pay. A court in Delaware said Medtronic was not infringing on the patents, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit threw out that ruling. Under legal doctrine, the company which files a lawsuit must prove its case. In this instance, that is Medtronic. And, under the same doctrine, a company which claims infringement must prove that infringement. In this case, that would be Mirowski. The justices focused most of their energies on Mirowski’s lawyer in an almost one-hour hearing focused on which side bears the burden of proof, but legal experts declined to guess which way the court might rule. “We’ve said time and again that the burden of proof normally does not shift. What is different here?” Justice Antonin Scalia asked Arthur Neustadt, representing Mirowski Family Ventures. In about five to 10 percent of patent infringement cases, many of them high stakes cases having to do with expensive medical devices, a company paying licensing fees will sue the patent holder, asking for a ruling that they don’t infringe, in order to stop paying royalties, said Daniel Ravicher, director of the Public Patent Foundation, which seeks to prevent abuse of the patent system. Two patents gave rise to the case. Both have to do with cardiac resynchronization therapy, a pacemaker which detects when the heart beats out of sync and then emits tiny shocks of electricity to correct its rhythm. It is used to treat congestive heart failure. But the Supreme Court case is not about patent infringement. Instead, the court is attempting to decide which of the two legal doctrines should apply in an instance where a company sues another company to seek a declaratory judgment of non-infringement. “There are other rules on burden of proof,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said to Neustadt. “For example, the party who has better access to the information. So it’s not as though there is this a firm rule with no exceptions.” The Supreme Court has a long history of disagreeing with the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent appeals. “The court asked many more questions of Arthur Neustadt and was far more friendly to Seth Waxman (for Medtronic) in the oral argument,” said Jim Crowne, director of legal affairs for the American Intellectual Property Law Association. A ruling is expected by the end of June.

137,MDT,FDA says recalled Medtronic guidewires potentially fatal,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration believes there is a reasonable probability that use of lots of Medtronic Inc’s medical guidewires that were recalled in October could be fatal, the medical device maker said on Friday. Medtronic spokesperson Joseph McGrath said the company started recalling 14,896 guidewires, or 181 lots, in the week of October 21, after receiving four complaints, including one patient injury, of the coating on the surface of the guidewires detaching. A guidewire is inserted into an artery to guide a catheter to a particular location in the body. The guidewires covered by the recall are designed to facilitate percutaneous coronary interventions, or the placement of left ventricular leads for cardiac rhythm devices, Medtronic said in a statement. Medtronic said the FDA classified the recall as a Class I, meaning that the regulator believes there is a reasonable probability that use of, or exposure to, the guidewires will cause serious adverse health consequences, or death. McGrath said the company does not expect the recall to have a material impact on its financial results. He said it had taken the necessary steps to prevent future shipments of the recalled products and had notified regulatory agencies around the world of the recall.

139,MDT,New smarter Medtronic pacemaker may cut future heart damage: study,"DALLAS (Reuters) - A new generation of Medtronic Inc’s EnRhythm pacemaker programmed to kick in only when heart rhythm disturbances are detected led to fewer deaths, hospitalizations and incidences of developing permanent heart problems than traditional versions of the device, according to data from a study. The enhanced pacing strategy had its most profound effect in cutting the risk of developing permanent atrial fibrillation - a dangerously irregular heartbeat - by 61 percent over the traditional pacemakers. Researchers conducting the 1,166-patient study, dubbed Minerva, found that the new pacing strategy helped avoid the side effects of continual electrical stimulation from standard pacemakers, which include weakening of the heart’s main pumping chamber as well as a progression to permanent atrial fibrillation. Patients in the study had a condition known as a bradycardia, in which the heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute, below the normal range of 60 to 100 beats per minute. They also suffered occasional bouts of atrial fibrillation, which if it becomes permanent puts a patient at five times the risk of suffering a stroke. The primary goal of the two-year trial was a reduction in a combination of death, hospitalizations and permanent atrial fibrillation. The more sophisticated pacemaker led to an overall 26 percent risk reduction compared to the traditional model, which researchers said was statistically significant. “For every 20 patients we treated, we attained saving one patient from permanent atrial fibrillation,” said Dr. Giuseppe Boriani, lead author of the Minerva study who presented the findings on Monday at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Dallas. The incidence of permanent atrial tachycardia - a type of heart rhythm disturbance - or atrial fibrillation was 3.8 percent with the enhanced pacemaker versus 9.2 percent for those with the traditionally programmed pacemaker, researchers found. In addition, after two years 15.2 percent of those with smart pacemakers were hospitalized and 4.6 percent died. That compared with hospitalizations of 16.8 percent and deaths of 5.6 percent for those with the older versions of the device. Patients with the enhanced pacemaker also reported better quality of life and less fatigue, researchers said. Boriani said he believed the results were definitive enough to change medical practice so that thousands more patients should get pacemakers with the enhanced features, which are also available in newer pacemakers made by Medtronic that followed the EnRhythm devices used in the study. “This smarter pacemaker does seem to offer benefit for these type of patients,” said Dr. Robert Harrington, chairman of Stanford University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. However, he said, “it should not be a reason to put the most advanced pacemaker in everybody.” ",11182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-medtronic-pacemaker/new-smarter-medtronic-pacemaker-may-cut-future-heart-damage-study-idUSBRE9AH0SL20131118

141,MDT,Medtronic profit up as heart device sales revive,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) reported higher quarterly earnings on Tuesday as stronger sales of its implantable devices to treat abnormal heart rhythms offset weakness in its spinal products business. The maker of pacemakers, insulin pumps and other medical devices said most of its businesses were performing in line with or better than the overall market. Demand for implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or ICDs, one of the company’s biggest product lines, is stabilizing after several years of declining sales due to economic weakness, Medtronic said. But the spinal products business remains under pressure, dragged down by a sharp decline in sales of bone growth stimulator Infuse, which is used in spine surgery. Studies have shown use of the bone growth product offers little benefit over conventional surgery and may have harmful side effects. “Medtronic turned in a solid, albeit mixed performance,” said JPMorgan analyst Michael Weinstein. The Minneapolis-based company earned $902 million, or 89 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter, ended October 25, compared with $646 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.4 percent to $4.2 billion. Excluding special items, earnings were 91 cents a share. On that basis, analysts’ average estimate was 90 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of ICDs, which treat irregular heart rhythms, increased 3 percent to $713 million. Spinal product sales fell 5 percent to $746 million. Medtronic competes against Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and St Jude Medical STJ.N in the ICD market. Pricing for the devices was flat in the quarter, but that’s an improvement from the 4 to 5 percent declines of a year ago, Medtronic said. Leerink Swann analyst Danielle Antalffy said the U.S. ICD market grew 3.4 percent in the quarter, the first quarter of growth since early 2010. “This is encouraging for all ICD manufacturers, including Boston Scientific and St Jude,” she said. Medtronic’s sales of structural heart products, which include replacement heart valves, rose 4 to $281 million. The company’s CoreValve is sold in Europe and is expected to launch next year in the United States, where it will compete with Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s (EW.N) Sapien heart valve. Sales in emerging markets, which have been a bright spot and area of focus for Medtronic, rose 11 percent to $513 million, but sales growth in those markets slowed due to weaker economies in Russia and China. Medtronic officials believe medical device sales will soon pick up again. “We expect this to rapidly start to re-accelerate. There are patients everywhere who need attention from existing therapies,” Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said on a conference call with analysts. Medtronic reiterated its full-year fiscal 2014 forecast for earnings of $3.80 to $3.85 a share, with revenue growth of 3 to 4 percent. Its shares were down 15 cents at $58.16 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

146,MDT,Medtronic's novel hypertension device fails in trials,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s experimental device to treat high blood pressure failed to meet its main goal in a clinical trial, sending the company’s shares down nearly 5 percent. The device, known as renal denervation system, is aimed at high blood pressure-patients who are resistant to traditional drug therapies and works by deadening nerves in kidneys. Analysts called the trial results disappointing, even though they did not have very high sales expectations from the device. “The impact of this news on Medtronic should be modest as we only model worldwide revenues (from the device) of ... 1.2 percent of total company sales in 2018,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Larry Biegelsen wrote in a note. However, despite meeting its main safety goal in the trial, Medtronic said it would halt ongoing trials of the device in the United States, Japan and India. The device was launched in Europe in April 2010, but its adoption was slow as austere governments were reluctant to pay for the unconventional technology. Several other medical device makers, including St Jude Medical Inc and Covidien, are also making devices aimed at treating high blood pressure. These devices work by creating tiny scars along nerves in the kidneys - organs that play a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure by sending signals to the brain that can cause blood vessels to constrict. This scarring process is carried out by threading a catheter through the renal arteries from the groin. It deadens the nerves and decreases blood pressure. Medtronic shares were down 2.5 percent at $59.29 in late morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They touched a low of $57.92 earlier in the session.

151,MDT,UPDATE 1-US court upholds Edwards heart valve patent in Medtronic case,"Jan 15 (Reuters) - A U.S. jury strengthened Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s efforts to protect sales of the company’s transcatheter heart valve implants, by ruling that a competing product from Medtronic Inc infringes its patent. Medtronic will appeal the award of more than $390 million in damages made by the jury in a federal court in Delaware and oppose any request for an injunction, the company said on Wednesday. Edwards said later in the day the ruling that Medtronic willfully infringed its patent entitled it to seek increased damages of up to three times the value of the award, in addition to attorneys’ fees. It said it would move to enforce the verdict and seek a permanent injunction against Medtronic’s CoreValve heart valve implant. “This (type of prolonged dispute) is fairly uncommon,” Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang said. Unlike the two rivals, most companies would have opted to cross-license their patents after such extended litigation, she said. Wang said continuing the litigation could help Edwards protect its monopoly in the U.S. transcatheter aortic valve replacement market through 2016-2017, when some of its patents face expiry. Edwards will lose protection in December 2017 for its U.S. Cribier transcatheter heart valve patent, which covers its most important product line - the Sapien system. The Sapien system allows surgeons to replace diseased heart valves by threading the new valve into place through an artery via a catheter, sparing patients chest cracking and open heart surgery. Edwards reported transcatheter heart valves sales of $172 million for its third quarter ended Sept. 30. In 2010, a jury in the same Delaware court awarded damages to Edwards after it found that Medtronic infringed Edwards’s Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent. That decision was upheld on appeal and Medtronic made an initial payment of $84 million to Edwards last year. However, additional damages are still pending, Edwards said. Last July, a German court also ruled that CoreValve, approved for sale in Europe, infringed Edwards’s patent. Medtronic said it expected U.S. approval for the CoreValve implant system by the end of its fiscal year ending April 2014. The U.S. market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements is expected to reach $2 billion by 2016, BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch told Reuters last February.

154,MDT,U.S. FDA approves Medtronic heart valve system early,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s minimally invasive system for replacing diseased heart valves won U.S. approval for use in patients deemed too frail to endure traditional open heart surgery, the U.S. medical device maker said on Friday. The Food and Drug Administration approved Medtronic’s CoreValve system based on U.S. clinical trials in which it was shown to be safe and effective while demonstrating low rates of stroke and valve leakage, the company said. Medtronic and Wall Street analysts had not expected the approval decision until April, giving the company a head start on efforts to seize market share from a similar rival product sold by Edwards Lifesciences Corp. News of the early CoreValve approval sent Edwards shares down nearly 5 percent. More than 100,000 people in the U.S. have severe aortic stenosis with about one-third too ill or frail for open-heart valve replacement surgery, making them candidates for CoreValve or the rival Edwards Sapien system. The systems, in which the replacement valve is threaded into place through an artery using a catheter - known as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR - spares patient’s chest-cracking surgery, cutting down on recovery time. CoreValve has been available since 2007 in Europe, where it is not uncommon for medical devices to win approval several years ahead of the United States. “We estimate the U.S. TAVR market will be approximately $450 million in 2014,” said Glenn Novarro, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “With approval earlier than expected, share loss for Edwards will likely occur sooner than expected,” added Novarro, who sees Medtronic grabbing 20 percent of the U.S. TAVR market this year, rising to more than 30 percent by 2016. But CoreValve’s U.S. sales prospects may hinge on further legal proceedings after a U.S. jury earlier this week found that the Medtronic system infringes a patent held by Edwards and awarded Edwards more than $390 million in damages. Medtronic vowed to appeal the decision and oppose any request for an injunction. Edwards, meanwhile, said the patent infringement ruling entitled it to seek increased damages of up to three times the value of the award. The FDA approved CoreValve without first requiring an expert advisory panel to review the device and make recommendations to the agency. “The low rates of stroke and valve leakage with the CoreValve System - two of the most concerning complications of valve replacement because they increase the risk of death and have a dramatic impact on quality of life - set a new standard for transcatheter valves,” Dr. Jeffrey Popma, director of Interventional Cardiology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and one of the lead investigators of the pivotal clinical trial, said in a statement. The CoreValve uses a smaller catheter than the currently approved Sapien, giving it a potential but temporary competitive edge. Edwards is awaiting U.S. approval of a next generation Sapien with a similarly smaller catheter. Both companies are also testing their systems in less high risk patients in hopes of broadening the potential patient population and market for the devices. Medtronic shares were up 18 cents at $59.29 in afternoon trading, while Edwards shares were off $3.49, or 4.8 percent, at $69.18, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

158,MDT,U.S. Supreme Court tosses out Medtronic pacemaker patent loss,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in favor of medical devices maker Medtronic Inc in its dispute with privately owned Mirowski Family Ventures LLC over whether the larger company infringed on Mirowski’s patents in making certain pacemakers. The case stems from Medtronic’s decision to ask a judge to rule that some of its pacemakers do not infringe on technology patented by Mirowski and licensed to Boston Scientific as well as Guidant Corp, part of Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories. A court in Delaware ruled for Medtronic, saying that even though Medtronic requested the ruling, or declaratory judgment, it was up to Mirowski to prove infringement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed, saying it was up to Medtronic to prove its case. The Supreme Court reversed that decision, arguing that the patent holder, in this case Mirowski, ordinarily must prove infringement and that this case was no different. “We hold that, when a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee (patent holder) to establish that there is no infringement, the burden of proving infringement remains with the patentee,” the Supreme Court said in a decision written by Justice Stephen Breyer. The two patents in the case have to do with cardiac resynchronization therapy, a pacemaker that detects when the heart beats out of sync and then emits tiny shocks of electricity to correct its rhythm. It is used to treat congestive heart failure. Medtronic licensed the patents in question, but in 2007, Mirowski Family Ventures claimed Medtronic was developing new products that would also justify royalty payments. Medtronic filed suit, seeking a ruling that it did not need to pay. Wednesday’s decision means that the case will return to lower courts for further proceedings, including a fight over infringement, said Arthur Neustadt, senior partner at Oblon Spivak LLP, who argued for Mirowski at the Supreme Court. “The burden of proof issue wasn’t one of the more significant issues,” he said. “Now it goes back to Federal Circuit for other issues to be considered.” The case is Medtronic v Boston Scientific Corp, Guidant Corp, and Mirowski Family Ventures, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-1128 ",1222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-medtronic/u-s-supreme-court-tosses-out-medtronic-pacemaker-patent-loss-idUSBREA0L23220140122

161,MDT,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Covidien to stop selling hypertension device,"(In Jan. 21 story, corrects name of Medtronic hypertension product to Symplicity, not Ardian, paragraphs 9, 12) By Susan Kelly Jan 21 (Reuters) - Covidien Plc said it would stop making a device for treating high blood pressure due to weak demand for the product, raising more doubts about the future of the novel technology. The decision comes less than two weeks after Medtronic Inc  said it was halting clinical trials for its high blood pressure device after the treatment, known as renal denervation, failed to prove effective in a key U.S. study.  Medtronic’s move surprised many observers. The devices, which are not available in the United States, take a new approach to treating hypertension and are aimed at patients resistant to traditional drug-based therapies. Some analysts had predicted the technology, which works by deadening nerves in the kidneys, could evolve into a $2 billion market by providing an alternative to drug therapy. Covidien said the decision to exit the business was a result of its regular review of strategic programs. “The company took a close look at the renal denervation market and realized it really is growing much slower than expected,” said Covidien spokesman Peter Lucht. He declined to comment on whether Medtronic’s study outcome played a role in his company’s decision. S&P; Capital analyst Phillip Seligman said the failed clinical trial of Medtronic’s product likely influenced Covidien’s decision but noted sales of the device were modest. He maintained a “strong buy” rating on Covidien shares. Covidien’s device, called OneShot, was sold in Europe and the Middle East. In Europe, where the product was approved in February 2012, adoption of such devices has run into reimbursement hurdles as governments have been reluctant to pay for the new technology. The devices work by creating tiny scars along nerves in the kidneys - organs that play a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure by sending signals to the brain that can cause blood vessels to constrict. Following its decision to halt clinical studies of its renal denervation system, Medtronic said it would form an independent panel of experts to make recommendations on the future of the product, called Symplicity. Medtronic continues to sell the product in 85 countries. It has been approved in Europe since April 2010. St Jude Medical Inc and Boston Scientific Corp  also sell renal denervation products in Europe and other markets. Boston Scientific acquired its system through the purchase of Vessix Vascular Inc in November 2012. A Medtronic spokeswoman said it was too soon to determine the next steps for Symplicity. “We don’t know if we would consider another clinical trial. We don’t know anything yet,” said  spokeswoman Wendy Dougherty. Covidien said it expects to record after-tax charges of $20-$25 million as a result of exiting the program. The company’s shares fell 1 cent to $68.19 on Tuesday.

162,MDT,Boston Scientific sees opportunity in rival's setback,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s stumble in its U.S. medical device study to treat high blood pressure could create an opportunity for other device makers to pick up where their rival has left off, Boston Scientific Corp Chief Executive Mike Mahoney said on Tuesday. Called the silent killer, high blood pressure affects as many as one in three American adults, and medical device makers were racing to develop a procedure to treat it before the failure of Medtronic’s major clinical trial. Boston Scientific is still forging ahead with plans to develop its own blood-pressure-lowering device, called a renal denervation system, for sale in the United States, Mahoney said in an interview. Renal denervation devices create tiny scars along nerves in the kidneys, which play a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure by sending signals to the brain that can cause blood vessels to constrict. The procedure currently is intended as an alternative to drug therapy for patients whose blood pressure is not well controlled by traditional medications. Boston Scientific will examine data from Medtronic’s halted study, in which the company’s device failed to prove effective, as it designs the U.S. clinical trial for its own product, Mahoney said. “Right now it’s going to be a slower market until BSC or another company delivers on a trial. When that happens, the market will open up, and it has the potential to be a multi-billion-dollar market,” he said. Medtronic had a jump start on the U.S. market in the development of a treatment, but the failure of its Symplicity device in the study, announced in January, caught many observers by surprise. Less than two weeks later, Covidien Plc said it would stop making its hypertension device, which was approved for sale in Europe in February 2012, due to weak demand. Mahoney said repercussions from Medtronic’s failed U.S. study will be felt in Europe, where cardiologists will be less inclined to recommend the treatment until more evidence of its effectiveness can be demonstrated in more clinical trials. Medtronic continues to sell its device there, and Boston Scientific in December launched its own offering. St. Jude Medical Inc is also rolling out a hypertension device in Europe. But Boston Scientific remains optimistic about the technology’s potential to help the millions of people struggling to control their blood pressure, Mahoney said. High blood pressure increases the risk for heart disease and stroke but often has no symptoms. “There’s clearly a huge patient unmet need,” he said. Mahoney said Boston Scientific’s device has features that differentiate it from Medtronic’s product, making it more consistent, faster to use and less painful for the patient. “We do feel the platform we have is a superior platform,” he said. Medtronic has said it will form an independent panel of medical experts to make recommendations on the future of its renal denervation product. Boston Scientific acquired its renal denervation system through the purchase of Vessix Vascular Inc in November 2012.

164,MDT,UPDATE 3-Medtronic profit falls on charges for blood pressure device,"By Susan Kelly Feb 18 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc on Tuesday reported a lower quarterly net profit after it took charges for a blood pressure-lowering device that failed to prove effective in a major clinical study. Revenue came in slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations, and earnings before special items met estimates as stronger sales of diabetes devices helped offset disappointing demand for pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or ICDs. Shares of Medtronic, the world’s largest stand-alone medical device maker, were down 1.5 percent at $56 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had risen 40 percent in 2013. Investors have been expecting the economic recovery to lift sales of medical devices, which slumped in recent years as demand for healthcare declined. “There is hope that we will see better performance out of this group, and we just simply aren’t seeing it on a wholesale basis,” said Jefferies & Co analyst Raj Denhoy. Medtronic posted flat worldwide sales of ICDs, which detect abnormally fast heartbeats and deliver an electric shock to restore normal rhythm. Some analysts had been looking for a slight boost to sales of the company’s biggest product category. Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak said the U.S. market for ICDs and other devices continued to stabilize in the company’s third quarter, which ended on Jan. 24. “Overall U.S. demand was pretty good, even though January, after the holidays, was a little soft,” he said in an interview. Net earnings fell to $762 million, or 75 cents a share, in the quarter from $988 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier. Medtronic recorded pretax charges of $200 million, primarily for a blood pressure treatment known as a renal denervation system. The company is still evaluating its long-term plans for the device, which it continues to sell in Europe. Excluding the charges and other one-time items, Medtronic earned 91 cents a share, in line with the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Though third-quarter results did come basically in line with expectations overall, Medtronic did deliver lower-than-expected results in certain key product lines,” Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said in a note to clients. Revenue rose 3 percent to $4.16 billion, edging past Wall Street expectations of $4.15 billion. Medtronic’s ICD sales were flat at $655 million. Pacemaker sales fell 4 percent to $439 million. Medtronic competes against Boston Scientific Corp and St Jude Medical Inc  in the heart rhythm management market. Sales of structural heart products, which include replacement valves, rose 3 percent to $281 million. The company gained U.S. regulatory approval in January for its CoreValve, which is implanted in a less-invasive procedure than traditional open-heart surgery. It has become the first such device to compete against Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s  Sapien valve in the United States. Medtronic is training physicians on the procedure and gradually ramping up sales of the product, which it expects to become an important area of growth. Spinal product sales slipped 1 percent in the quarter to $744 million. Sales of diabetes products climbed 16 percent to $436 million, boosted by the rollout of a new insulin pump that stops delivery when a sensor reaches a preset threshold. Sales in emerging markets, an area of increasing focus for the company, rose 10 percent to $521 million. The jump was below the company’s targeted percentage rate in the mid to high teens due to pressures in Eastern and Central Europe, Medtronic said, but it expects a return to stronger growth in the region in the coming quarters. Medtronic tightened its fiscal 2014 earnings forecast to a range of $3.81 to $3.83 a share, compared with its previous outlook of $3.80 to $3.85 and analysts’ estimates of $3.82.

With China’s healthcare spending forecast to nearly triple to $1 trillion by 2020 from $357 billion in 2011, according to consulting firm McKinsey, the country is a magnet for makers of medicines and medical equipment, but many patients remain strongly attached to traditional approaches. “What’s growing the most within Chinese healthcare is traditional medicine. It’s a strong part of their culture,” said Lilian Montero, a healthcare analyst at Swiss bank Julius Baer. “Local companies tend to show superior growth in emerging markets. It’s a good move from that point of view.” Dihon has about 2,400 employees and generated sales of 123 million euros ($168 million) in 2013, Bayer said on Thursday. It declined to provide the financial terms of the deal but brokerage M.M. Warburg estimated it was worth about 500 million euros ($680 million). Even though TCM is winning a following in some urban communities in the West, Bayer said it was too early to say whether Dihon products would be exported to Germany or Europe. “It’s less likely that these products will move to the West,” said Julius Baer’s Montero. “You would need a lot more medical training and education, otherwise it will stay a niche market like homeopathy.” Dihon’s products include dandruff treatments, antifungal creams and medicine against gynaecological conditions such as endometriosis. The deal, which could help Bayer challenge Johnson & Johnson  to the No. 1 spot in the over-the-counter (OTC) market, underscores its push into herbal medicine after it bought smaller German supplier Steigerwald last year.

168,MDT,UPDATE 1-Survival rate with Medtronic's CoreValve tops surgery -study,"(Adds study details, background, analyst, doctor comment) By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson WASHINGTON, March 29 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s  minimally invasive CoreValve system for replacing diseased aortic heart valves led to a significantly higher survival rate after one year than traditional open heart surgery in patients deemed at high risk of death during surgery, according to data from a study presented on Saturday. One year after receiving the CoreValve in the 795-patient Phase III trial, the rate of death was 14.2 percent compared with a 19.1 percent death rate in the surgery group, researchers said. The result, presented at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington, was deemed to be statistically significant. There was also no increased risk of stroke seen with CoreValve compared with surgery, which had been one of the main concerns of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) early on in clinical testing. “I think the results were outstanding,” said Dr. David Adams, a co-principal investigator of the CoreValve trial. TAVR systems use a catheter threaded through an artery to the heart to put the new valve in place, sparing patients chest-cracking open-heart surgery and typically longer hospital stays associated with the invasive surgical procedure. Early on, Adams explained, the question was could TAVR be an alternative as good as surgery. “Now, it might be better,” he said. “We’re making continual progress. It’s not only an alternative but may be a preferable alternative.” CoreValve won U.S. approval in January, three months earlier than expected, to treat patients deemed too frail to endure open heart surgery, known as extreme-risk patients. The latest results in high-risk, or less ill, patients should help expand the approval to treat a larger group as Medtronic competes with Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s  Sapien valve replacement, the first to gain U.S. approval. Both have been available for several years in Europe, where medical devices tend to get approved far more quickly. “A positive outcome in the CoreValve high-risk trial should lead to approval in this patient population in the U.S. by the end of 2014,” Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a research note prior to release of the data. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has determined that data from the study would be sufficient to make an expanded approval decision without first convening an expert advisory panel to discuss it, Medtronic said. In addition to the survival result, the rate of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events was significantly lower with CoreValve - 20.4 percent versus 27.3 percent for surgery. That was a combination of death from any cause, heart attack, stroke or need for another procedure. More than twice as many patients in the surgery group went on to develop atrial fibrillation, a potentially dangerous irregular heart beat, researchers reported. More than 100,000 people in the United States have severe aortic stenosis with about one-third too ill or frail for open-heart surgery, making them potential TAVR candidates. Patients are typically older than 80 years old. Glenn Novarro, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, estimated the U.S. TAVR market to be worth about $450 million in 2014. As positive clinical trial results mount in less extreme risk patients and physician acceptance increases, sales of the systems could provide important growth drivers for Medtronic and Edwards. “I think TAVR is going to have broader acceptance for increased risk patients,” said Adams, chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at Mt Sinai Hospital in New York. The primary difference between the two systems is that Sapien uses a balloon, such as those employed in angioplasty procedures, to expand the valve once it is in place. The Medtronic system uses a special alloy that self expands as it reacts to body heat once the valve is in place. CoreValve also uses a smaller catheter than the currently approved Sapien. But the next generation Sapien XT device with a smaller catheter is expected to gain U.S. approval in the coming months. Doctors and investors may get a glimpse of how the competition will shape up later at the ACC meeting, when German researchers present results of a head-to-head study comparing CoreValve with the Sapien XT. Quality of life measures with those who received CoreValve were deemed to be non-inferior, or about as good, as those whose valves were surgically replaced. There were some disadvantages reported in the CoreValve patients, including a low but significantly higher rate of valve leakage and a higher rate of need for permanent implantation of a pacemaker. Adams said those issues were minor given the survival advantage demonstrated in the trial. “The message is very clear,” he said. “It was a superior outcome.”   (Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and James Dalgleish)",3292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-heart-medtronic-valve/update-1-survival-rate-with-medtronics-corevalve-tops-surgery-study-idUSL1N0MQ09F20140329
169,MDT,Medtronic valve for heart defects works well a year later: study,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A non-surgically implanted heart valve meant to delay open heart surgery in children with congenital heart defects worked well for all but a few patients during a year of follow-up observation, in line with favorable results seen in original clinical trials of the Medtronic Inc product. The Melody transcatheter pulmonary valve was approved in 2010 under a U.S. humanitarian device exemption, which allowed it on the market as long as a follow-up study was conducted to assess the product’s reliability and safety. The valve is guided to the heart by a catheter, a minimally invasive procedure. In the study of patients who had been implanted with the valve there was no narrowing of the valve, or stenosis, after six months in some 96.7 percent of the 90 patients for whom data was available. After a year, there was no narrowing, significant leakage or need for additional intervention in 94 percent of patients, researchers said on Sunday. “The valves had excellent function during the first year, judged by no more than mild leakage and very few patients had narrowing of the valve,” said Dr. Aimee Armstrong of the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories, who was lead investigator for the follow-up study sponsored by Medtronic. The mean age of patients in the trial was 20, with ages ranging from 5 to 45. The valve is made from a cow’s jugular vein that is sewn into a metal stent, and then inserted into the patient’s leg and advanced to the heart. Within the first year of the study, eight adverse events were seen, including three cases of heart infections, two abnormal heart rhythms and one case each of bacterial infection, major stent fracture and blood clot in the lung. Patients will continue to be followed for five years. Results of the multi-center study were released at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology in Washington. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect in the United States, affecting an estimated 1 million adults and 800,000 children. Some 40,000 babies with the defects are born each year in the United States. Many have no pulmonary valve, which carries blood from the heart’s right ventricle to the lungs, or only a very small pulmonary valve. Some patients receive a connecting tube, or conduit, early in life, to provide blood flow. The conduits, typically made from cadaver pulmonary valves, from pig valves or bioprosthetic materials, are implanted during open heart surgery and essentially bypass the missing or inadequate pulmonary valve. But the conduits over time can become leaky and narrowed, putting stress on the right ventricle and preventing it from squeezing properly. As a result, patients can develop abnormal life-threatening heart rhythms and symptoms such as inability to exercise. At that point, patients have traditionally required open heart surgery to replace the pulmonary valve. But such surgery, which requires cutting open the rib cage to get direct access to the heart, causes scar tissue that makes future surgery much more difficult. Medtronic’s Melody valve is meant to provide additional blood flow when conduits become faulty, and thereby delay the need for more open heart surgery. “Every time you do open heart surgery, more scar tissue develops, with more potential damage to the heart” in subsequent surgery, said lead investigator Armstrong. She said it was too early to determine just how long the Melody valve would last, or how long it would delay the need for more open heart surgery. But she said patients in other trials have had the Medtronic valve for five to seven years, with no need for surgery. To date, over 6,000 patients have received the Melody valves, more than half of them children having congenital heart defects. Melody was the world’s first approved transcatheter valve, and such valves could help speed recovery times and spare great expense. “This is an overnight procedure,” Armstrong said. “Most patients go home the next day, whereas open heart surgery typically requires a week of hospitalization and patients then take off school or work a few weeks after that.” ",3302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-valve/medtronic-valve-for-heart-defects-works-well-a-year-later-study-idUSBREA2T0LU20140330

171,MDT,UPDATE 2-Edwards heart valve system tops Medtronic version in small study,"(Adds independent doctor comments) By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - The minimally invasive aortic heart valve replacement system from Edwards Lifesciences Corp performed better than a rival product sold by Medtronic Inc in the first head-to-head study of the two, according to data from a small German trial presented at a major heart meeting on Sunday. The results are unlikely to be seen as decisive given the size and limited scope of the study. But they could provide the Edwards sales force with a valuable marketing tool as the two companies vie for market share with their competing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, systems. Both systems employ a catheter to thread the new valve through an artery into place in the heart, sparing patients too frail for open heart surgery from the invasive chest cracking procedure. The Edwards Sapien XT uses a balloon to expand the compressed valve once it is in position in the diseased valve, while the Medtronic CoreValve has a special self expanding valve using an alloy that reacts to body heat to open. The results were presented at the American College of Cardiology’s annual scientific sessions in Washington. In the 241-patient study conducted at five German hospitals, doctors using the Edwards balloon expandable system reported a success rate of 95.9 percent compared with a 77.5 percent success rate for those using the Medtronic alternative. A successful procedure was defined as one in which the valve was implanted in the correct position and provided a tight enough seal to prevent blood leakage across the valve. Patients receiving the Edwards valve also reported improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness, chest pain and dizziness 30 days after the procedure at a higher rate than those in the Medtronic group: 94.3 percent versus 86.7 percent. “We have two main types of valves available for this procedure, and until now, there was no conclusive data about their relative effectiveness,” Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Wahab, the study’s lead investigator, said in a statement. But the definitions of effectiveness used as the primary goals for the German study may be viewed as limited in value. Virtually all doctors who perform heart valve replacements, typically in patients aged 80 and older, agree that the most important clinical results for these procedures are rates of death and stroke. By those all-important measures, there was no significant difference between the two TAVR systems 30 days after the procedure. “Medtronic believes that physicians will look to more rigorous trials with hard clinical endpoints when evaluating these valves to provide reliable guidance on TAVR device selection,” Medtronic said in a statement. Medtronic also took issue with the method used to assess aortic valve leakage in the independent German study, calling the angiography readings “the least effective measure for determining aortic regurgitation.” The researchers plan to follow the patients for five years to compare the longer-term health outcomes of the two groups, which is likely to yield more meaningful information. “It’s possible some of these differences might not persist over time,” said Dr. Saul Vizel, a cardiologist with Cambridge Memorial Hospital in Cambridge, Ontario, who was not involved in the study. “The jury is still out for sure, because they’re doing one-year and two-year follow-ups and people will wait for those.” Dr. Patrick O’Gara, incoming president of the American College of Cardiology from Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston, also was not ready to declare a  winner based on the German study. “I would like to see a larger trial with more endpoints,” O’Gara said. “It would be premature to overinterpret these findings.” Not surprisingly, Edwards Lifesciences had a more favorable view of the findings than Medtronic. “This independent, multi-center randomized study is consistent with the experience in Europe, where more clinicians choose Sapien XT over CoreValve for the treatment of their patients,” Edwards spokeswoman Sarah Huoh said in an emailed statement. “These data are reflective of the findings of multiple, real-world European registries.” TAVR procedures have been performed in Europe since 2007 but are relatively new in the United States. The first Sapien system gained U.S. approval in 2011, and Medtronic’s CoreValve was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January. The CoreValve uses a smaller, potentially easier-to-maneuver, catheter than the original Sapien. Edwards expects U.S. approval of the next-generation Sapien XT with a similarly smaller catheter in the coming months. More than 100,000 people in the United States have severe aortic stenosis, with about one-third too ill or frail for open-heart surgery, making them potential TAVR candidates. Industry analysts expect the Sapien XT and CoreValve to be important future growth drivers for Edwards and Medtronic. “We now have new valves coming out that will probably be even better,” Abdel-Wahab said. “These results can help inform the design of future devices.”   (Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Rosalind Russell and Jonathan Oatis)",3302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-heart-edwards-medtronic/update-2-edwards-heart-valve-system-tops-medtronic-version-in-small-study-idUSL1N0MR06Z20140330

175,MDT,Edwards shares up on injunction against Medtronic heart valve,"(Reuters) - Shares of Edwards Lifesciences Corp jumped 13 percent on Monday after a U.S. court temporarily halted sales of competitor Medtronic Inc’s heart valve implant that uses a less-invasive procedure to spare patients from open-heart surgery. The ruling, by a U.S. District Court in Delaware on Friday, came after earlier court decisions that found Medtronic’s CoreValve infringed on Edwards’ Sapien transcatheter valve product. The court agreed to postpone implementation of the ruling for seven days to allow Medtronic to appeal. Medtronic on Monday said it filed a motion in appeals court seeking an emergency stay of the preliminary injunction. The lower court on Friday ordered both companies to come to an agreement that would help physicians at facilities currently trained to use the CoreValve system to a make a clinical judgment as to which device to implant. Analysts said the ruling came as a surprise and that the court would still have to weigh the injunction against the public interest. “How does a judge take a product off the market that has shown an ability to reduce mortality,” J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a note to clients. Medtronic, in its motion on Monday, said if the injunction were permitted to go into effect, “treatable patients may unnecessarily die in the name of already expired patent rights.” Medtronic’s CoreValve system for replacing diseased aortic heart valves led to a significantly higher survival rate after one year than traditional open heart surgery in patients deemed at high risk of death during surgery, according to data the company presented at a conference in March. CoreValve won U.S. approval in January to treat patients too frail to endure open heart surgery, becoming the first such device to compete against Edwards’ Sapien valve in the United States. Edwards said it has petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to extend its patent on Sapien, known as the Anderson patient, to early 2016. Canaccord Genuity analyst Jason Mills said he believes Edwards is likely to accept either a lump-sum award for damages from Medtronic or continuing royalties. “While we believe Edwards has a better chance than we previously thought of being granted a permanent injunction against Medtronic, we still expect Edwards to ultimately cash in via other forms of equitable relief in lieu of a final injunction,” Mills said. Edwards shares pared gains but were up at $81.62 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Medtronic shares fell 2 percent to $58.01.

The ruling, by the Federal District Court of Delaware on Friday, was made following earlier court decisions that found Medtronic’s CoreValve to have infringed on rival Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s transcatheter heart valve patents. Edwards Lifesciences shares rose as much as 16 percent in early trading to their highest in nearly a year.

177,MDT,U.S. court postpones injunction against Medtronic heart valve,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday postponed an injunction that would have stopped Medtronic Inc from selling its CoreValve heart valve implant in competition with Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s Sapien valve product. The injunction, issued by a U.S. District Court in Delaware last week, would have taken effect on April 23. Earlier court decisions found Medtronic’s product infringed on the Edwards valve. Monday’s ruling means the injunction would take effect only if the appellate court determined it was properly issued, Medtronic said. Medtronic is appealing the injunction with the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which has agreed to an expedited appeal, requiring the last appeal brief to be submitted by June 19. “This stay of injunction should come as some relief to Medtronic investors who were shocked when Edwards was granted a preliminary injunction on CoreValve a week ago,” Bernstein Research analyst Derrick Sung wrote in a note to clients. Investors and physicians had assumed that the benefit to patients’ health would have prevented an injunction from being issued, Sung said. Both companies’ implants use a less-invasive procedure that spares patients from undergoing traditional open-heart surgery for valve replacement.

The U.S. market for the procedure is expected to top $500 million this year and double in size by 2018, Jefferies analysts predict. Edwards was first to market with its Sapien technology in 2011 in the United States, while Medtronic received U.S. regulatory approval for CoreValve in January. “We think it is an important breakthrough in many ways for people with this disease, and we are focused on aggressively rolling this out as quickly as we can,” Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said in an interview. Medtronic, the world’s largest standalone medical device maker, also posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and gave an initial forecast for its 2015 profit that disappointed some investors. Its shares slumped about 1 percent midday.    Edwards stock fell 1.8 percent as investors braced for further market share shifts to Medtronic. “Edwards could have forced Medtronic off the market. The settlement caps the potential of the litigation win,” said Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy.         Medtronic said it would give Edwards a one-time payment of $750 million, plus royalties through April 2022 based on a percentage of CoreValve sales. A minimum annual payment was set at $40 million a year. CoreValve replaces diseased aortic heart valves in patients considered too frail for open-heart surgery, which requires separating the chest bone. Medtronic was the first device maker to compete against Edwards’ Sapien valve. In April, a U.S. court issued an injunction that would have stopped Medtronic from selling CoreValve. The injunction was later suspended while an appeals court reviewed the case. Earlier court decisions had found that CoreValve infringed Edwards’ Sapien product.  Medtronic said net earnings declined to $448 million, or 44 cents a share, in the quarter ended April 25, from $969 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. The company recorded $746 million in  charges for the Edwards settlement and a product liability settlement for its Infuse bone-growth stimulator.  Excluding items, Medtronic said it had earned $1.12 a share, matching analysts’ average forecast.  Revenue increased 2 percent to $4.57 billion as stronger sales of diabetes products offset weakness in implantable heart defibrillators and spine devices. “Overall, the earnings are what’s weighing on the stock today,” said Edwards Jones analyst Jeff Windau.  Medtronic forecast fiscal 2015 earnings of $4 to $4.10 a share. The average analyst forecast was $4.09, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

182,MDT,Medtronic settles U.S. kickbacks case over pacemakers,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc has agreed to pay the United States $9.9 million to settle claims that the company used kickbacks to induce doctors to implant its pacemakers and defibrillators in patients, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The government had accused Medtronic of inducing doctors to use its products by paying them to speak at conferences, developing marketing and business plans at no cost, and providing tickets to sports events. “These sorts of improper financial incentives not only undermine the integrity of medical decisions, they also waste taxpayer funds and are unfair to competitors who are trying to play by the rules,” U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner in Sacramento, California, said in a statement on Wednesday. Medtronic, in a separate statement, said the accord resolves claims over its marketing practices from 2001 to 2009, and involves no admission of wrongdoing. The company also said it has in recent years adopted new policies governing its business relationships with doctors. The whistleblower case resolved claims under the federal False Claims Act against Minneapolis-based Medtronic, one of the world’s largest heart device makers. It was originally brought by Adolfo Schroeder, who said he was a business development manager who joined Medtronic in May 2006. Schroeder will receive about $1.73 million in the settlement, the government said. Medtronic reported net profit of about $3.07 billion for its fiscal year ended April 25.

186,MDT,Humana sues Medtronic over Infuse bone growth product,"June 2 (Reuters) - Managed care company Humana Inc  has filed a lawsuit against Medtronic Inc accusing the medical device maker of falsely representing its Infuse bone growth-stimulation product as safe and effective in spinal fusion surgeries. The suit, filed on Friday in federal court in Tennessee, alleges that Medtronic paid for academic literature that fraudulently portrayed the product as safe and effective for uses not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Humana said it paid for the use of Infuse, a bioengineered bone protein, when less expensive and more medically sound alternative procedures were available. It said Medtronic engaged in a “sophisticated and deeply deceptive marketing strategy” to expand the market for Infuse, paying and encouraging spine surgeons to use the product by overstating its benefits while minimizing serious risks. Medtronic, in a separate statement, said the product’s label has reflected its risks from the time of FDA approval in 2002. “Medtronic strongly believes that the safety profile reported to the FDA and detailed in product labeling support the continued safe use of Infuse Bone Graft for approved indications,” the company said. Medtronic also said it “vigorously disagrees with any suggestion that the company improperly influenced peer-reviewed published manuscripts.” Physicians are compensated for intellectual property rights and for legitimate and documented consulting services provided to the company, Medtronic said. Independent reviews of the product initiated by Medtronic last year determined that Infuse works as well as traditional bone grafts taken from patients, but may not be as safe. The reviews were prompted by questions raised by spine experts and U.S. lawmakers about the safety of the product, which contains a genetically engineered protein known recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 to promote bone growth. Infuse was once hailed as a major advance in spinal fusion surgery, offering an alternative to painful bone harvesting from other parts of the body to perform a bone graft. But in 2011, Infuse became the subject of investigations by the U.S. Senate and Department of Justice over off-label use of the product and omissions of safety problems from its clinical trial data. The product also drew intense public scrutiny after the influential Spine Journal ran an entire issue criticizing it in June 2011, charging that surgeons who were paid tens of millions of dollars by Medtronic failed to report serious complications such as male sterility, increased risk of cancer, infections, pain and bone dissolution.

Last week, orthopedic device maker Stryker Corp (SYK.N) said it did not intend to make an offer for Smith & Nephew, following a Financial Times story that suggested it was preparing a bid. Medtronic executives, speaking Thursday at the company’s analyst meeting, said they would not answer questions about potential acquisitions. Instead, the company emphasized it would adhere to a set of guidelines for any future deals, including a goal for minimal negative impact on earnings per share. Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said the company would look to build on its track record for acquisitions that added $1.4 billion in revenue with no net earnings dilution in the last fiscal year. The company has completed 16 acquisitions in the past five years. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Larry Biegelsen said he does not believe Medtronic is preparing a bid for Smith & Nephew, which holds a 12 percent share of the hip and knee market. Acquiring the smaller device maker would not give Medtronic the heft it seeks when entering a new market, Biegelsen said in a note to clients. “Management indicated that deals would be primarily based on strategic fit, not financial reasons such as tax inversion,” Bielgelsen said. Ishrak, at the analyst meeting, reiterated the company’s long-term goals of accelerating revenue growth to the mid-single digits, with earnings per share growing 200 to 400 basis points above that.  Medtronic also expects to generate more than $25 billion in free cash flow over the next five years and remains committed to returning 50 percent of it to shareholders.  Like many of its peers in the medical device sector, Medtronic has struggled with weaker demand for treatments, especially elective procedures, due to high unemployment and changing insurance policies that require patients to shoulder more of their healthcare costs. Hospital cost-cutting efforts are pressuring prices on products such as orthopedic devices as well as heart stents and implantable defibrillators and pacemakers. Medtronic said it would improve revenue growth through a combination of new therapies, sales in emerging markets and a focus on providing hospitals with integrated health strategies surrounding the products it sells.

The London market also tracked gains in European stock markets, which rose after the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates to record lows on Thursday and unveiled new measures to strengthen the region’s economy and fight off the risk of Japan-life deflation. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up by 0.2 percent, or 10.14 points, at 6,828.77 points going into the close of the trading day. Smith & Nephew rose 3.5 percent, making it one of the best-performing FTSE stocks in percentage terms, after a media report that U.S. rival Medtronic was looking at bidding for it. Smith & Nephew declined to comment on the report. Smith & Nephew’s shares had also risen at the end of May, on speculation that rival Stryker would bid for it. Stryker denied it was planning a bid but traders said Smith & Nephew would continue to be supported by the backdrop of takeover talk. “There’s no smoke without fire. As long as you’ve got the takeover talk in the background, there should be further upside in the stock,” said Dafydd Davies, senior trader at London-based Prime Wealth Group. The FTSE hit a peak of 6,894.88 points last month, which marked its highest level since December 1999. The index is up by around 1 percent since the start of 2014, but some traders said it needed to break out above the 7,000 point level - which would mark a record high for the FTSE - in order to start a stronger rally on the market. “We have yet to test the psychological level of 7,000 in the FTSE.

193,MDT,Weak mining stocks push down UK's FTSE ahead of ECB,"* FTSE 100 down 0.3 pct * ECB expected to cut rates later on Thursday * Mining stocks fall after weak Chinese data * Smith & Nephew up on report of Medtronic bid interest By Sudip Kar-Gupta LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Britain’s top equity index fell on Thursday, weighed down by a drop in mining stocks after data showed that services sector growth in major metals consumer China had slowed down. Traders were also waiting to see if the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting later in the day would yield fresh economic stimulus measures, as expected by many investors, before making their next move. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down by 0.3 percent, or 17.97 points, at 6,800.66 points by the middle of the trading day. The FTSE 350 Mining Index fell 0.5 percent after data showed that growth in China’s services sector had retreated to a 4-month low in May. “We’re not a huge fan of the mining sector right now, and we also believe that gold and silver prices will come down,” JNF Capital trader Rick Jones said. Medical technology company Smith & Nephew bucked the weaker market to rise 5.1 percent after a media report that U.S. rival Medtronic was looking at bidding for it. Smith & Nephew declined to comment on the report. The ECB is poised to impose negative interest rates on its overnight depositors, seeking to cajole banks into lending and to prevent the euro zone from falling into Japan-like deflation. But since many investors view these steps as having already priced into stock markets, any disappointment could result in a pullback. Mike Mason, senior trader at Sucden Financial Private Clients, said that if the FTSE failed to hold above the 6,800 point level, it could then fall further down to the 6,720-6,760 points range.

194,MDT,"FTSE drifts lower ahead of ECB meeting, Smith & Nephew jumps","* FTSE 100 down 0.2 pct * Smith & Nephew jumps on report of Medtronic bid interest * Miners fall after weak China data By Tricia Wright LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Britain’s top shares drifted further away from multi-year highs on Thursday, with investors reluctant to place bets before a European Central Bank meeting, which is expected to yield fresh monetary easing. Medical technology company Smith & Nephew bucked the slightly weaker market, rising 4.2 percent in brisk trade on reports that U.S. medical device maker Medtronic is looking at a takeover of London-based Smith & Nephew. Smith & Nephew declined to comment. “Smith & Nephew’s always had a lot of bid speculation around it; it’s a swirling long-term story. I don’t know whether this is going to happen; it seems to be a lot like the famous Pfizer/AstraZeneca (bid story) - the deal probably makes sense but there’s an added tax benefit to Medtronic if they manage to do it,” Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said. “I think (Smith & Nephew) probably will go higher from here; there probably will be a firm bid of some kind, but I’m not sure it will actually complete.” Trading volume in Smith & Nephew was 1-1/2 times its 90-day daily average after only an hour’s trade. Turnover on the broader FTSE 100 was just 7 percent of its average. The index was down 16.48 points, or 0.2 percent, at 6,802.15 points by 0756 GMT, trading just over 1 percent shy of a peak hit last month of 6,894.88 - its highest level since December 1999, when it set a record peak of 6,950.60 points. The ECB, at its meeting on Thursday, is expected to cut its main interest rate and impose negative interest rates on overnight deposits, aiming to prompt banks to lend instead and to prevent the euro zone from slipping into Japan-like deflation. It is also expected to launch a long-term refinancing operation targeted at businesses. But with these measures seen as already priced into equity markets, any disappointment could result in a pullback. “I’m slightly nervous actually,” said Peel Hunt equity strategist Ian Williams. “People are expecting a rate cut plus a lending measure plus some kind of comments about QE (quantitative easing), or whatever the next step may be if inflation continues to undershoot. If we don’t get that ... potentially we are a bit vulnerable.” Miners proved a drag on the FTSE 100, dropping 0.7 percent after data showed growth in top metals consumer China’s services sector retreated to a four-month low in May.

196,MDT,Medtronic nears $45 billion-plus deal for Covidien: sources,"(Reuters) - U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc is in advanced talks to buy rival Covidien Plc in a deal valued at $45 billion to $50 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday. The deal, which would allow Medtronic to be domiciled in Ireland, where Covidien is based, and thus take advantage of lower tax rates, could come as soon as Monday, one person said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Minneapolis-based Medtronic, the world’s largest stand-alone medical device maker, with an array of products ranging from heart defibrillators and stents to insulin pumps and spinal implants, has a market value of about $61 billion. Covidien, a maker of devices used in surgery, is valued at about $32 billion. In a market that has seen an accelerated pace of deal-making, some aimed at redomiciling major U.S. companies overseas, Pfizer Inc PFE.N recently mounted an abortive takeover bid for British-based AstraZeneca AZN.L in what would have been a roughly $120 billion deal aimed in part at lowering the U.S. drug firm’s corporate tax rate. Medical device makers in recent years have struggled with slowing sales and pricing pressure as governments overseas slash budgets and the United States transforms its healthcare system under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, hospitals are looking to reduce supply costs in part by consolidating vendors amid sluggish demand for services as patients avoid going to the doctor because of a lack of insurance or rising out-of-pocket costs for care. “It makes sense on a lot of levels, both strategic and financial,” Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy said of the potential combination. There are a lot of reasons to believe it is going to happen.” Acquiring Covidien, with its focus on minimally invasive surgical procedures, would help expand Medtronic’s footprint in the marketplace, as the two companies have very little product overlap, Denhoy said. The medical device industry is seeing more mergers such as Zimmer Holdings Inc’s recently announced $13.4 billion takeover of smaller rival orthopedic device maker Biomet Inc as companies in the sector move to cut costs and become more efficient. Pfizer’s bid for AstraZeneca, which was rejected, was one of a few recently launched major deals that have looked to take advantage of an increasingly popular tax-lowering strategy known as an inversion. Several smaller transactions have succeeded, drawing the attention of U.S. lawmakers in Congress who are targeting legislation that would make it much more difficult for U.S. companies to do profitable inversions.  A Reuters review showed about 50 such deals had been done in the past 25 years, with half occurring since the 2008-2009 credit crisis abated.

198,MDT,UPDATE 3-Sanofi and Medtronic team up on diabetes drug-device combination,"(Adds Toujeo phase 3 results, application to regulators) By Natalie Huet PARIS, June 14 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi  said on Saturday it was teaming up with U.S. medical device maker Medtronic in diabetes. The announcement comes as Sanofi seeks to defend its No.2 spot in a global diabetes market worth over $40 billion, at a time when top-selling drug Lantus, the world’s most prescribed insulin, is set to lose patent protection early next year. Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding, Sanofi and Medtronic will initially cooperate on developing drug-device combinations and offering care management services for diabetes patients. Depending on the results, they will consider other areas for collaboration, the companies said in a statement. Financial terms were not disclosed. “We see our diabetes franchise as a growing franchise even beyond the patent expiry of Lantus and this (partnership) will be an element which helps continue that growth,” Sanofi CEO Chris Viehbacher told Reuters, declining to provide detailed forecasts. The alliance, which covers type 2 diabetes, will bring together Sanofi’s insulin portfolio and Medtronic’s insulin pumps and glucose monitoring, with a focus on sufferers unable to achieve glucose control despite multiple daily injections of insulin, the companies said. An estimated 382 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation, with type 2 diabetes, often associated with obesity, accounting for 90 percent to 95 percent of all cases. Sanofi and Medtronic already have an agreement in Europe covering an implantable insulin delivery system for type 1 diabetes and plan to add this to their alliance, they said. Diabetics have inadequate blood sugar control which can lead to complications including nerve and kidney damage. Worldwide deaths from the disease are running at over 5 million a year, as over-eating and lack of exercise fuel an epidemic of type 2 diabetes. Sanofi faces tough competition from market leader Novo Nordisk and close rival Lilly & Co, in addition to much smaller generic producers. Its star diabetes drug Lantus, also known as insulin glargine, was developed in the 1990s and currently accounts for close to a fifth of the company’s sales and over a third of operating profit. As a successor for this cash cow, it is developing an improved, long-acting version of Lantus called Toujeo. In a separate statement on Saturday, Sanofi said phase three results for Toujeo “consistently showed significantly fewer low blood sugar events” compared with Lantus. The European Medicines Agency accepted on May 27 to examine Sanofi’s request to market the drug, Sanofi said, adding that it was waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to agree to consider its application in the United States.

204,MDT,Medtronic's Covidien deal raises bar for rivals to merge,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s (MDT.N) $43 billion deal for Dublin-based Covidien Plc COV.N should accelerate already intense efforts by medical device rivals to seek merger partners, industry analysts and bankers said on Monday. Medtronic announced the transaction on Sunday, saying it would re-base the combined company in Ireland, where it can take advantage of lower corporate tax rates and easier access to cash generated overseas.  The purchase also gives Medtronic more products, as well as  greater leverage in negotiating with hospital clients that are taking a much harder line on device spending.   The intensified competition will bring new pressure on large device makers such as Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Stryker Corp (SYK.N) and St Jude Medical Inc STJ.N to seek acquisitions, industry watchers say. Medtronic plus Covidien will rival industry leader Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) $28.5 billion in annual device revenue. UK-based Smith & Nephew Plc (SN.L), which has already attracted takeover interest from companies seeking better tax rates overseas, remains high on the list of targets, they said. Device makers such as  Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) should feel more pressure to get bigger or face being left out in the cold. The merger mania is a product of pressures on the healthcare systems in the United States and in Europe, where hospitals are getting paid less to deliver care. U.S. hospital systems are consolidating and buying doctor practices to cope with the changes. “It becomes more necessary for the medical device companies to have a broader product line in order to be able compete and have economies of scale,” said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the San Francisco-based healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. Medtronic said its own appetite for deals does not end with absorbing Covidien. It expects to use some of the additional cash flow from the deal on acquisitions and minority investments, and internal research and development. “There still are plenty of opportunities for us to focus on other acquisitions, other innovation. That momentum doesn’t need to stop, even in this integration period,” Medtronic Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis said in a conference call with analysts. Medtronic has been especially eager to expand beyond selling devices to providing advisory services to hospitals.   “To the degree we can bring in other acquisitions to support that further, we will look closely at that,” Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said. The latest consolidation wave in the medical device arena began in April when Zimmer Holdings Inc ZMH.N reached a deal to buy rival Biomet Inc for more than $13 billion, expanding its orthopedic product offerings. Rival orthopedics maker St Jude Medical “could be an acquirer of a smaller company to emulate what Medtronic is doing,” Yaffe said. Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang has Stryker atop her list of potential acquirers. “That company is a serial acquirer and CEO Kevin Lobo has indicated that it is trying to move the company in the direction of becoming a larger partner with its hospital customers, the same strategy that Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic are taking to heart,” Wang said.       Wang sees Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW.N) as a target whose specialty in heart valves would fit in with a number of companies interested in cardiac products.   Yaffe listed Hospira Inc HSP.N, Becton Dickson and Co (BDX.N), Baxter International Inc (BAX.N) and Massimo Corp (MASI.O) as attractive takeover candidates that could help a larger company become more of a one-stop shop for hospitals. While several industry experts pointed to Boston Scientific as an acquirer, it could still be wary in the wake of its $27 billion purchase of Guidant in 2006. The deal left it heavily in debt and struggling with a depressed stock price for years. Medtronic is acquiring Covidien in a so-called inversion transaction that allows it to reincorporate in Ireland.        Analysts said the strategy will give Medtronic access to cash generated through sales outside the United States and now held overseas without paying a penalty for repatriating the money. This benefit overshadows the modest reduction in the overall corporate tax rate that the company is forecasting. Medtronic also said Monday it would maintain its prior forecast for fiscal 2015 earnings in the range of $4 to $4.10 a share. Its shares were off 1.4 percent at $59.87, while those of Covidien were up 20.7 percent at $86.93.

205,MDT,Medtronic deal draws Washington scrutiny of tax relocations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The threat of U.S. tax revenue losses from Medtronic Inc’s (MDT.N) plan to buy rival Covidien Plc COV.N and move its base to Ireland is stoking concerns from lawmakers and the Obama administration about corporate tax “inversion” deals.  While such deals used to be rare, a recent flurry of them has motivated Democrats to propose legislation to make it harder for companies to use inversion deals that reap tax benefits from reincorporating in low-tax jurisdictions overseas.    Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and an Oregon Democrat, said the Medtronic deal underscores the urgent need to pursue corporate tax reform instead of waiting until after the 2016 presidential election. “This will be a wakeup call,” Wyden said in an interview with Reuters. “It’s clear that the system rewards this kind of gaming.”  Wyden in May promised to make it harder for U.S. companies to do inversion deals that take place on or after May 8, 2014, but such a reform has not yet gained widespread support. Medtronic is acquiring Covidien for $42.9 billion in an inversion transaction that allows it to reincorporate in Ireland to take advantage of lower tax rates.  When asked about this latest agreement, a U.S. Treasury Department spokeswoman said the administration has put its weight behind legislative reform to deter inversion deals.  “We appreciate the efforts of those in Congress who are advancing legislative solutions to curtail inversions and help prevent the erosion of the U.S. tax base,” Treasury spokeswoman Erin Donar said of Democratic legislation introduced in May. “Stopping this practice as part of comprehensive tax reform continues to be a priority for the administration,” she said.  Senator Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Finance Committee, blasted Democrats’ anti-inversion efforts on Monday. “It’s total, total BS,” Hatch told reporters in the Capitol. “What they want to do is put more burdens on our companies,” Hatch said in response to questions about the Medtronic deal. Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, where Medtronic is based, said on Monday that the proposed deal could bring up to 1,000 jobs to his state. But Franken said he remains concerned about the cost of inversions to individual taxpayers. “This needs careful scrutiny, and I plan to take a very close look at the specifics in the coming days,” he said in a statement.

208,MDT,"Medtronic, Covidien match up on services strategy before deal","CHICAGO, June 16 (Reuters) - Well before Medtronic Inc  and Covidien Plc announced their $43 billion merger, the two medical device makers had reached common conclusions about how they needed to change. Their hospital customers, under pressure from government payment cuts and patients struggling to pay or simply staying away, are slashing budgets and taking a harder line on prices, from rubber gloves to heart stents. By 2007, medical device sales had slowed dramatically from double-digit percentage growth to the low-single-digits, and hopes for a rebound have since faded. U.S.-based Medtronic on Sunday said it would buy Covidien and moving its executive headquarters to Ireland to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates. The combination of their product lines will make them a leader in six out of the top 10 hospital purchasing categories. Medtronic hopes that will add to its leverage in device sales as hospitals narrow down the number of vendors they buy from. In interviews with Reuters in recent weeks, executives from both companies said they were also focused on providing more advisory services to hospitals, suggesting how doctors could save money and improve care with data on standardizing surgical procedures and management of chronic disease. “The company realized back in the late 2000s that the world was changing,” said Dr. Michael Tarnoff, chief medical officer for Covidien. “You can’t just take the physicians out to dinner and build relationships and expect to build your sales.” Covidien is trying to help hospitals create protocols for procedures ranging from hysterectomies to weight-loss surgery, based on evidence of what would work best for most patients. “Covidien sees itself as a company that wants to move toward being a partner and not just a vendor,” Tarnoff said. Medtronic in March launched a two-year pilot program with insurer Aetna Inc to help improve blood sugar control and lower costs for diabetic patients using its insulin pumps. It also has arranged consulting contracts in Europe that focus on cardiac catheterization laboratories, where heart procedures such as stent implants are performed. “It is a services business model we have started to participate in and one we see further traction in going forward,” Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said. “We think we can be a leader in this shift to value-based healthcare.” Some industry experts are not yet convinced that hospitals will involve device makers in decisions affecting clinical practice. “My sense is hospitals still view these companies as vendors,” said Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy. In the United States, President Barack Obama’s health reform law is accelerating an overhaul of the $3 trillion healthcare system. U.S. doctors have traditionally been paid for the number of services they perform, rather than whether a patient’s health improves. In the past, that encouraged physicians to order the newest, most expensive medical technology and, critics argue, perform procedures on many more patients than necessary. Now hospitals and insurers want to restructure how they compensate doctors based on a patient’s health outcome. The impact is felt even more broadly now because as many as 30 percent of U.S. doctors now work directly for hospitals or in hospital-owned practices after a wave of consolidation. With hospitals exerting more control over device spending, they are directing physicians to switch from device brands they preferred to use in the past, said Deloitte consultant Paul Kreder. On big-ticket items such as implantable defibrillators, Kreder also advises hospital clients to cut back the number of vendors they use to just two or three companies. “Companies are trying to broaden their product portfolios and trying to broaden the services and solutions they offer. The advantage to that is they become potentially more of a one-stop shop,” said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.

210,MDT,Medtronic's Covidien deal raises bar for rivals to merge,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s (MDT.N) $43 billion deal for Dublin-based Covidien Plc COV.N should accelerate already intense efforts by medical device rivals to seek merger partners, industry analysts and bankers said on Monday. Medtronic announced the transaction on Sunday, saying it would re-base the combined company in Ireland, where it can take advantage of lower corporate tax rates and easier access to cash generated overseas. The purchase also gives Medtronic more products, as well as  greater leverage in negotiating with hospital clients that are taking a much harder line on device spending.   The intensified competition will bring new pressure on large device makers such as Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Stryker Corp (SYK.N) and St Jude Medical Inc STJ.N to seek acquisitions, industry watchers say. Medtronic plus Covidien will rival industry leader Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) $28.5 billion in annual device revenue. UK-based Smith & Nephew Plc (SN.L), which has already attracted takeover interest from companies seeking better tax rates overseas, remains high on the list of targets, they said. Device makers such as  Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) should feel more pressure to get bigger or face being left out in the cold. The merger mania is a product of pressures on the healthcare systems in the United States and in Europe, where hospitals are getting paid less to deliver care. U.S. hospital systems are consolidating and buying doctor practices to cope with the changes. “It becomes more necessary for the medical device companies to have a broader product line in order to be able compete and have economies of scale,” said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the San Francisco-based healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. Medtronic said its own appetite for deals does not end with absorbing Covidien. It expects to use some of the additional cash flow from the deal on acquisitions and minority investments, and internal research and development. “There still are plenty of opportunities for us to focus on other acquisitions, other innovation. That momentum doesn’t need to stop, even in this integration period,” Medtronic Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis said in a conference call with analysts. Medtronic has been especially eager to expand beyond selling devices to providing advisory services to hospitals.   “To the degree we can bring in other acquisitions to support that further, we will look closely at that,” Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said. The latest consolidation wave in the medical device arena began in April when Zimmer Holdings Inc ZMH.N reached a deal to buy rival Biomet Inc for more than $13 billion, expanding its orthopedic product offerings. Rival orthopedics maker St Jude Medical “could be an acquirer of a smaller company to emulate what Medtronic is doing,” Yaffe said. Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang has Stryker atop her list of potential acquirers. “That company is a serial acquirer and CEO Kevin Lobo has indicated that it is trying to move the company in the direction of becoming a larger partner with its hospital customers, the same strategy that Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic are taking to heart,” Wang said.       Wang sees Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW.N) as a target whose specialty in heart valves would fit in with a number of companies interested in cardiac products.   Yaffe listed Hospira Inc HSP.N, Becton Dickson and Co (BDX.N), Baxter International Inc (BAX.N) and Massimo Corp (MASI.O) as attractive takeover candidates that could help a larger company become more of a one-stop shop for hospitals. While several industry experts pointed to Boston Scientific as an acquirer, it could still be wary in the wake of its $27 billion purchase of Guidant in 2006. The deal left it heavily in debt and struggling with a depressed stock price for years. Medtronic is acquiring Covidien in a so-called inversion transaction that allows it to reincorporate in Ireland.        Analysts said the strategy will give Medtronic access to cash generated through sales outside the United States and now held overseas without paying a penalty for repatriating the money. This benefit overshadows the modest reduction in the overall corporate tax rate that the company is forecasting. Medtronic also said Monday it would maintain its prior forecast for fiscal 2015 earnings in the range of $4 to $4.10 a share. Its shares were off 1.4 percent at $59.87, while those of Covidien were up 20.7 percent at $86.93.

216,MDT,U.S. Senate's tax writer sees 15-month 'window' for tax reform,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate’s chief tax law writer on Tuesday vowed to work on overhauling the federal tax code by August 2015, citing a move by Medtronic Inc to shift its tax home base to Ireland as a spur to congressional action. Senator Ron Wyden, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he wants to cut the corporate income tax rate to 24 percent from 35 percent, chiefly by eliminating loopholes. Wyden has advocated this proposal for years. Multinational companies have been clamoring for a tax cut. The Oregon Democrat said there will be an opening for tax reform between now and Congress’ August 2015 break. After that, lawmakers will be consumed by 2016 presidential election-campaign politics, he said. “There is a prime 15-month window from now until the August recess of 2015,” he said at a Wall Street Journal conference. “We do need to go after some of these loopholes,” Wyden said. “You go in there, clean those out, and use the money to hold down the rates.” Wyden is one of the few lawmakers in the U.S. Congress to have a comprehensive plan for rewriting the tax code. He first offered it as legislation in 2010. Congress has not thoroughly recrafted the loophole-riddled tax code since 1986. Republican Senator Dan Coats has worked closely with Wyden. A spokeswoman for Coats told Reuters he “is in discussions with Senator Wyden about updating and improving their proposal.” Tax reform efforts in both the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Democrat-controlled Senate stalled this year amid deep disagreement over tax and spending policies. Efforts to rewrite the tax code may not gain traction next year, either, said Representative Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee.  “Possibility next year? I don’t rank the possibility that high,” Van Hollen told reporters at an event. But some lawmakers have refocused on this daunting project because of a flurry of deals by major U.S. multinationals to move their tax domiciles offshore.

The inversion strategy is rare, but is becoming more common. About half of the 50 or so deals done in the past 25 years have occurred just since the 2008-2009 financial crisis ended.

219,MDT,BoAML underwrites Medtronic's $16.3 billion bridge loan,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) is raising a $16.3 billion senior unsecured bridge loan to finance its $42.9 billion acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien Plc COV.N, banking sources said on Tuesday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) is the sole initial bookrunner of the deal, which is one of the bank’s biggest loan underwriting commitments to date, and is also acting as the sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, a senior banker close to the deal said. Medtronic agreed to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc and shift its executive headquarters to Ireland on June 15 in the latest move by U.S. firms to access lower corporate tax rates abroad. Medtronic was not immediately available for comment.  BoAML’s $16.3 billion sole underwriting is bigger than its $15.25 billion share of the $61 billion bridge loan that backed Verizon’s (VZ.N) acquisition of Verizon Wireless in September 2013, which was underwritten by four banks. BoAML was also the sole underwriter of a $4 billion loan for Swiss engineering group ABB’s ABBN.VX acquisition of US electrical connectors manufacturer Thomas & Betts in March 2012. A sole underwriting of this size shows confidence in liquid debt markets, which are giving rise to hopes of an M&A; renaissance, several bankers said. “The credit markets are very strong at the moment, which gives comfort around the debt capital markets takeout and the bank market is strong and deep, which gives comfort on the ability to syndicate the risk if needed,” the senior banker said. The deal has been structured in two tranches. One tranche is a bridge loan to bond issues, which are expected to be issued quickly, as is typical of acquisition bridge financings. The second tranche is a bridge loan to cash which will allow Metronic to source cash from different parts of its business, the senior banker said. It is not yet clear if either tranche will be syndicated. Medtronic needed the full $16.3 billion underwriting to show certainty of funds to the Irish stock exchange, the senior banker said. The $42.9 billion cash-and-stock transaction values the global healthcare technology and medical supplies provider at $93.22 per share, representing a 29 percent premium to Covidien’s closing stock price of $60.70 on Friday, Medtronic said.  Medtronic will pay $35.19 in cash plus 0.956 shares of Medtronic stock for each Covidien share. It will also assume approximately $5 billion of Covidien debt, according to a company presentation. Moody’s Investors Service affirmed Medtronic’s A2 rating on Monday, and put Covidien’s Baa1 rating on review for upgrade. Covidien shareholders will own approximately 30 percent of the combined company, Medtronic said. The combination is expected to result in at least $850 million of annual pre-tax cost synergies by the end of fiscal year 2018.

220,MDT,RLPC-BoAML underwrites Medtronic's $16.3 bln bridge loan,"LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc is raising a $16.3 billion senior unsecured bridge loan to finance its $42.9 billion acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien Plc, banking sources said on Tuesday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) is the sole initial bookrunner of the deal, which is one of the bank’s biggest loan underwriting commitments to date, and is also acting as the sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, a senior banker close to the deal said. Medtronic agreed to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc and shift its executive headquarters to Ireland on June 15 in the latest move by U.S. firms to access lower corporate tax rates abroad. Medtronic was not immediately available for comment. BoAML’s $16.3 billion sole underwriting is bigger than its $15.25 billion share of the $61 billion bridge loan that backed Verizon’s acquisition of Verizon Wireless in September 2013, which was underwritten by four banks. BoAML was also the sole underwriter of a $4 billion loan for Swiss engineering group ABB’s acquisition of US electrical connectors manufacturer Thomas & Betts in March 2012. A sole underwriting of this size shows confidence in liquid debt markets, which are giving rise to hopes of an M&A; renaissance, several bankers said. “The credit markets are very strong at the moment, which gives comfort around the debt capital markets takeout and the bank market is strong and deep, which gives comfort on the ability to syndicate the risk if needed,” the senior banker said. The deal has been structured in two tranches. One tranche is a bridge loan to bond issues, which are expected to be issued quickly, as is typical of acquisition bridge financings. The second tranche is a bridge loan to cash which will allow Metronic to source cash from different parts of its business, the senior banker said. It is not yet clear if either tranche will be syndicated. Medtronic needed the full $16.3 billion underwriting to show certainty of funds to the Irish stock exchange, the senior banker said. The $42.9 billion cash-and-stock transaction values the global healthcare technology and medical supplies provider at $93.22 per share, representing a 29 percent premium to Covidien’s closing stock price of $60.70 on Friday, Medtronic said. Medtronic will pay $35.19 in cash plus 0.956 shares of Medtronic stock for each Covidien share. It will also assume approximately $5 billion of Covidien debt, according to a company presentation. Moody’s Investors Service affirmed Medtronic’s A2 rating on Monday, and put Covidien’s Baa1 rating on review for upgrade. Covidien shareholders will own approximately 30 percent of the combined company, Medtronic said. The combination is expected to result in at least $850 million of annual pre-tax cost synergies by the end of fiscal year 2018. Medtronic said it would keep its operational headquarters in Minneapolis and pledged $10 billion in U.S. technology investments over the next 10 years.

221,MDT,"Medtronic says was victim of cyber attack, lost patient records","BOSTON (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N), the world’s largest stand-alone medical device maker, was the victim of a cyber attack and lost some patient records in separate incidents last year, it said in a regulatory filing on Friday. “Medtronic, along with two other large medical device manufacturers, discovered an unauthorized intrusion to our systems that was believed to originate from hackers in Asia,” the company said in a 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The company said in the filing the hackers did not breach any databases that store patient information, but it disclosed a separate incident in which it lost an undisclosed number of records of patients from its diabetes business unit, which sells insulin pumps and related products. It was not know what type of information was contained in the patient records. “While we found no evidence of a breach or inadvertent disclosure of the patient records, we were unable to locate them for retrieval,” the document said.  It said the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had questioned Medtronic about the loss of the records, and that the company provided the agency with information on the problem and its data security practices. Medtronic officials could not be reached to elaborate on the contents of the 10-K filing, which did not identify the other companies involved in the breach. Tom Kellermann, chief security officer with Trend Micro Inc (4704.T), which makes security software, said the cybersecurity of medical device makers tends to lag behind industries such as banking and defense contractors.  “The security posture of most device manufacturers is in critical condition,” said Kellermann, who was not privy to details of the attack on Medtronic. He said medical device makers focus too much on complying with government regulations for securing patient information with data encryption, but they fail to properly monitor and secure internal networks to identify and stop hackers who get past traditional firewalls and anti-virus software. Medtronic’s disclosure came less than a week after announcing plans to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc COV.N for $42.9 billion.

224,MDT,UPDATE 2-Medtronic CEO says Covidien deal good for U.S. economy,"(Adds CEO comments, earnings details) By Susan Kelly Aug 19 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc Chief Executive Omar Ishrak defended his company’s plan to acquire Dublin-based Covidien Plc in a so-called inversion deal, saying the medical device maker will be able to create more U.S. jobs while still paying substantial taxes once the transaction closes. Medtronic, which announced its $42.9 billion acquisition of Covidien in June, is among a number of U.S. corporations that have unveiled inversion deals in recent months to establish a tax domicile abroad. President Barack Obama has criticized the strategy as a rush by companies to avoid U.S. corporate taxes, and the administration is weighing executive actions. Medtronic has maintained the main rationale for the deal is strategic, combining the two companies’ complementary product lines, and will free up cash generated overseas for reinvestment in the United States. Ishrak, in remarks during the company’s earnings conference call on Tuesday, said Medtronic expects to invest “much more aggressively” in the United States after the deal closes, resulting in accelerated creation of high-paying U.S. medical technology jobs. “Acquiring Covidien is good for Medtronic, for our shareholders, for patients, for the medtech industry and ultimately good for the U.S. economy,” he said. In an interview, Ishrak said the company’s effective tax rate on global income will fall to about 16-17 percent after the deal from 18-19 percent now. Medtronic on Tuesday reported the strongest quarterly U.S. sales growth for its medical devices in five years and said it was committed to completing the Covidien acquisition by the end of the year or early 2015. The Minneapolis-based company also confirmed its full-year profit and revenue outlook. The company’s shares were flat at $63.60 in midday trading. Net earnings fell to $871 million, or 87 cents a share, in the first quarter ended July 25 from $953 million, or 93 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges and costs related to the Covidien acquisition, Medtronic earned 93 cents a share. Analysts on average expected 92 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4 percent to $4.27 billion, while analysts had forecast $4.25 billion. U.S. revenue increased 6 percent to $2.33 billion, buoyed by new products, including an implanted diagnostic monitor for the heart called Reveal, that offset weakness in its core markets for spinal devices and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. The company’s new CoreValve replacement heart valve in the two quarters since its launch has captured 40 percent of the U.S. market for valves that can be implanted in a less-invasive procedure than traditional open-heart surgery, Medtronic said. It competes against Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s Sapien heart valve. Medtronic reiterated its outlook for fiscal 2015 profit of $4.00 to $4.10 a share, excluding special items, and revenue growth in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent adjusted for currency fluctuations.

228,MDT,WRAPUP 2-New U.S. tax rules chill 'inversion' deal-making; shares dive,"* U.S. moves against tax-avoidance “inversion” deals * Burger King-Tim Horton deal to proceed * Action may deter Pfizer from returning to bid for AstraZeneca   (Recasts with Medtronic comments, update stock moves) By Kevin Drawbaugh and Soyoung Kim WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Tough new U.S. rules on corporate “inversions” on Tuesday sent a chill through the market for the tax-avoidance deals, both pending and potential, with share prices falling sharply in nearly a dozen companies on both sides of the Atlantic. As investors sold stocks involved in inversions, in which U.S. companies escape high taxes at home by redomiciling abroad, analysts and tax lawyers were surveying the damage to deals currently in the works and the outlook for future transactions. Despite new rules that will make some inversions costlier and others more difficult to do, Burger King Worldwide Inc  said it will proceed with its $11.5 billion deal with Canada’s Tim Hortons Inc, stressing that the transaction was not about tax benefits. In announcing their intention to proceed, the two companies said in a statement: “This deal has always been driven by long-term growth and not by tax benefits.” The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled harsher-than-expected changes late on Monday to the existing rule book for inversions, which have surged this year and caused concern in Washington about the threat posed to the U.S. corporate income tax base. Effective immediately, the rules will mean little for companies that have already inverted. But for at least 10 companies in the midst of completing such deals, and for those considering inversions, the impact will be significant. Most pending deals could become more costly for the buyers, such as AbbVie Inc and its $54.7 billion deal to acquire Ireland’s Shire Plc, as well as Medtronic Inc  and its $42.9 billion takeover of Covidien Plc. Neither of these transactions, the biggest of the year, was expected to fall apart completely, partly because paying a break-up fee to walk away would likely be even more costly. AbbVie would have to pay Shire a $1.6 billion penalty if it were to renege on their merger agreement, for instance. Medtronic has a contract that lets it or Covidien walk away from their deal if the U.S. Congress changes tax law. The Treasury’s new rules fall short of that, so a break-up fee likely would loom in this case, too, if the merger were called off. With a grid-locked Congress failing to act, investors had been expecting an Obama administration clamp-down on inversions. But the rules it announced were more far-reaching than anticipated, analysts at Deutsche Bank said. “Inversion deals now are clearly going to be very difficult to pull off,” said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities. An inversion typically involves a U.S. company buying a smaller, foreign rival and reincorporating in its home country, where taxes are lower, opening a range of options for the combined business to lower its U.S. and global tax bills. About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s, but the pace has picked up, with half of them completed since the 2008-2009 credit crisis, according to a Reuters review. A key target of the Treasury’s actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals under a tax rule that defers taxes on profits until they are brought to the United States. One of the new Treasury rules will prevent inverted companies from using “hopscotch” loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping tax-deferred foreign profits. Another rule will bar inverters from gaining access to  offshore profits by using “decontrolling” strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S.-controlled. The Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that the former U.S. investors can have in an inverted company for it to qualify for foreign tax treatment under U.S. law, a move that will make it harder to do the deals. The U.S. Treasury has acknowledged that one of the new rules is broad enough to hit companies that are not inverting. A senior official, who asked not to be named, said some cash transfers from foreign corporations to U.S. subsidiaries could now be taxed, even if not involved in an inversion. “There’s a relatively small provision ...which would affect both inverted and non-inverted, basically any foreign-owned firms,” the official told reporters on Monday. Treasury officials said on Tuesday that the rules were effective immediately and that any deals completed as of Monday were not affected, while deals completed later would be. Despite this, some investment bankers on Tuesday expressed uncertainty about the finality and timing of the rules. Bankers and analysts also said they expect more from the Treasury Department. “This move is a good and necessary start toward discouraging corporate inversions, which cost U.S. taxpayers billions in lost revenue,” said Thomas Hungerford, a tax expert at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank. No two inversions are exactly alike, so the impact of the rules will depend on the aspects of inversion each deal emphasizes, whether it is protecting foreign profits from U.S. taxation or gaining access to foreign profits already deferred. In London, AstraZeneca, which had been the target of a failed inversion bid by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc, slid 3.6 percent. The Treasury rules were seen as possibly deterring Pfizer from making another bid after a $118 billion takeover attempt failed in May. AbbVie slid 2.3 percent in midday U.S. trading, while Pfizer, the biggest U.S. pharmaceutical company, dipped 0.3 percent. Burger King was down 2.2 percent in New York. AbbVie officials did not have any immediate comment on the latest developments. Other U.S.-listed issues under pressure from the Treasury actions included Abbott Laboratories, down 1.6 percent; Covidien, down 2.4 percent; Medtronic, down 3.1 percent; and Mylan, down 0.1 percent.

229,MDT,UPDATE 3-U.S. Treasury moves against tax-avoidance 'inversion' deals,"(Adds Obama, Medtronic, Durbin, Hatch comments, links) By Kevin Drawbaugh and Jason Lange WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Moving against tax avoidance by corporations, the Obama administration took several actions on Monday to curb  “inversion” deals that allow companies to escape high U.S. taxes by reincorporating abroad. The Treasury Department announced new rules, effective immediately, that will reduce the tax benefits available to companies that have inverted, while also making new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding. Because they took effect on Monday, the new rules might raise issues for some of a handful of companies that have  agreed to do inversions, but have not yet completed them. Fast-food chain Burger King Worldwide Inc is in the midst of inverting to Canada in a deal with coffee-and-donuts vendor Tim Hortons Inc. A spokeswoman for Burger King said the company declined to comment. Asked about the impact on pending deals, a senior Treasury official told reporters on a conference call: “If they are closed and done as of today, then they are not subject to this. If they are closed tomorrow or after, they are subject to this.” President Barack Obama, who has sharply criticized inverting companies, said the Treasury Department’s steps would “discourage companies from taking advantage of corporate inversions - moving their tax residence overseas on paper to avoid paying their fair share in taxes here at home.” The announcement of the rules followed months of growing concern on Capitol Hill, with Democrats urging prompt legislative action and Republicans pushing to address the problem later, perhaps in 2015, as part of a broader overhaul of the loophole-riddled federal tax code. Companies that do inversions, which are legal and already subject to certain restrictions, say they are only trying to minimize their tax bills, which investors expect. About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s, but half of those have been completed just since the 2008-2009 credit crisis, according to a Reuters review. Inversions have surged in the past year, pursued by big companies such as Burger King and medical technology group Medtronic Inc, which is working to close an inversion deal into Ireland with rival Covidien Plc. Medtronic spokesman Fernando Vivanco late on Monday told Reuters: “We are studying Treasury’s actions. We will release our perspective on any potential impact on our pending acquisition of Covidien following our complete review.” Medtronic has said it expects to close the Covidien acquisition by the end of this year or early 2015. Inversions usually involve a U.S. corporation buying a smaller, foreign rival and redomiciling in its home country, where taxes are lower, even though core operations typically remain in the United States. (Graphic on corporate inversions: reut.rs/1tWc9p7) Treasury Secretary Lew said in a statement: “These first, targeted steps make substantial progress in constraining the creative techniques used to avoid U.S. taxes, both in terms of meaningfully reducing the economic benefits of inversions after the fact, and when possible, stopping them altogether.” A key target of Treasury’s actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals under a U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rule that defers taxation on such profits unless and until they are brought into the United States. One new Treasury rule will prevent inverted companies from using “hopscotch” loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax-deferred foreign profits. Another rule will bar inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of profits by using “decontrolling” strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S.-controlled. Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that the former U.S. owners can have in an inverted company to qualify for foreign tax treatment from the IRS, a move that will make it harder to do these deals. Some companies had feared that new rules might be imposed retroactively, but they were not. Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group, said the administration “may succeed in chilling the climate for further deals, but this was not as strident as it could have been, especially in that they don’t do anything retroactively.” SIDE-STEPPING CONGRESS The rules were the administration’s latest effort to tackle what it sees as a pressing issue by taking executive actions that side-step a gridlocked Congress. “When corporations choose to invert and don’t pay their fair share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab,” said Democratic Senator Dick Durbin in a statement. “Today, the Obama administration put these corporate tax deserters on notice: we are not going to stand by while they game the tax code and avoid their responsibility to our country,” Durbin said. Though in disagreement about the issue’s urgency, both Democrats and Republicans have said inversions are a symptom of a broken tax code that needs a thorough overhaul, a job that has eluded Congress and successive presidents since 1986. Senator Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the tax law-writing Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement: “In the end, any solution that permanently addresses inversions must be legislated by Congress.”   (Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson in Washington, Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles, Susan Leach in Chicago, Bill Berkrot and Jeffrey Dastin in New York, Bernie Woodall in Detroit; Editing by Diane Craft, Steve Orlofsky, Andre Grenon and Lisa Shumaker)",9232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/tax-inversion-treasury/update-3-u-s-treasury-moves-against-tax-avoidance-inversion-deals-idUSL2N0RN29G20140923

233,MDT,New U.S. tax rules may lead Medtronic to redo inversion deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc is likely to try to renegotiate the structure and terms of its $42.9 billion deal to buy Ireland’s Covidien Plc in response to new U.S. tax rules, according to people familiar with the situation. The U.S. Treasury this week reduced the ease and benefits of U.S. companies buying foreign rivals so they can move their tax domicile abroad, a practice known as inversion. Concerns that U.S. companies were using the strategy to avoid paying taxes spurred the action. The new rules make it more expensive for Medtronic to buy Covidien, by potentially requiring it to take out a loan instead of using cash held abroad, according to the people familiar with the matter and a Reuters analysis of the contract.  Covidien, which originally approached Medtronic, could be asked to consider a lower price, and to take more stock and less cash, these people said. Increasing the stock component of the deal would be needed to meet the new government threshold for an inversion and resulting dip in U.S. taxes.  It remains unclear how receptive Covidien will be to that possibility, and it has some leverage, since Medtronic faces an $850 million breakup fee if it abandons the deal.  While Covidien allowed Medtronic to freely walk away from a deal in the event of a U.S. tax law change, the new Treasury guidelines fall short of a U.S. law change. If shareholders of either company vote down the deal, there is no breakup fee. Medtronic did not respond to requests for comment, but it said earlier this week that it was studying Treasury’s actions and would release its position following a review. Covidien could not be immediately reached for comment. The allure of smaller tax bills in countries such as Ireland and Britain has prompted at least 10 U.S. companies to attempt inversions this year, a record. Medtronic and AbbVie, which has agreed to buy Dublin drugmaker Shire Plc for $54.7 billion, are both subject to the new restrictions, raising questions about this year’s two largest announced inversions. Lawyers and bankers say Medtronic appears to be the biggest victim of the rules, not only for the size and structure of its deal, but also given the fact that a key target of Treasury’s actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals. Medtronic has roughly $14 billion of cash held overseas, the most among the nine companies with pending inversion deals. AbbVie, meanwhile, has a significant portion of its $10 billion cash held in foreign subsidiaries. A big draw of the Covidien takeover was the potential to access substantially all of Covidien’s cash without subjecting it to U.S. tax. Under U.S. tax law, Medtronic has to pay a U.S. corporate tax of 35 percent if it brings home foreign earnings, for purposes such as distributions to shareholders. Many inversions are driven by the promise of lower tax rates, but Medtronic already has an effective tax rate of 18 percent, similar to that of Covidien. It has said the combined company’s tax rate would decline by one or two percentage point. One new tax rule prevents inverted companies from using “hopscotch” loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax-deterred foreign profits. Another rule bars inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of profits by using “decontrolling” strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S. controlled. Those guidelines mean Medtronic may now have to rely on a roughly $13.5 billion bridge loan to finance the cash portion of its Covidien deal. Medtronic had planned to lend some of its foreign money to its new Irish parent to help pay for the deal, according to the merger document, but that plan is now potentially exposed to the anti-hopscotch rule. While the cash would have been a zero cost, drawing on the loan would incur Medtronic an initial interest expense of around 1.15 percent, which would rise further depending on the duration of the loan, according to calculations by Thomson Reuters Loan Pricing Corp. Morgan Stanley analyst David Lewis this week estimated that raising debt would cut earnings-per-share accretion from the deal by 3-4 percent, or 14-18 cents per share, and would nearly double a key debt load ratio, pro forma total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Further, in order to make the merged company an Irish-domiciled entity under the new U.S. tax rules, Medtronic will have to increase the stock component of the cash-and-stock offer such that Covidien shareholders end up with more than 40 percent of the combined company. Currently, Covidien shareholders are set to own 30 percent of the merged company.  The merger, if successful, would create a close competitor in size to the medical device business of industry leader Johnson & Johnson Co. It broadens Medtronic’s scope beyond its array of heart devices, spinal implants and insulin pumps into devices used in surgical procedures. The companies said the expansion should allow them to provide one-stop service to hospitals, thus better competing for business, particularly in the United States where healthcare reform and shrinking government reimbursement for medical procedures has kept pressure on device pricing. They forecast the combination would bring at least $850 million of annual pre-tax cost synergies by the end of fiscal 2018.

243,MDT,U.S. government probes medical devices for possible cyber flaws,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is investigating about two dozen cases of suspected cybersecurity flaws in medical devices and hospital equipment that officials fear could be exploited by hackers, a senior official at the agency told Reuters.  The products under review by the agency’s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, or ICS-CERT, include an infusion pump from Hospira Inc and implantable heart devices from Medtronic Inc and St Jude Medical Inc, according to other people familiar with the cases, who asked not to be identified because the probes are confidential. These people said they do not know of any instances of hackers attacking patients through these devices, so the cyber threat should not be overstated. Still, the agency is concerned that malicious actors may try to gain control of the devices remotely and create problems, such as instructing an infusion pump to overdose a patient with drugs, or forcing a heart implant to deliver a deadly jolt of electricity, the sources said. The senior DHS official said the agency is working with manufacturers to identify and repair software coding bugs and other vulnerabilities that hackers can potentially use to expose confidential data or attack hospital equipment. He declined to name the companies. “These are the things that shows like ‘Homeland’ are built from,” said the official, referring to the U.S. television spy drama in which the fictional vice president of the United States is killed by a cyber attack on his pacemaker.  “It isn’t out of the realm of the possible to cause severe injury or death,” said the official, who did not want to be identified due to the sensitive nature of his work.  Hospira, Medtronic and St Jude Medical declined to comment on the DHS investigations. All three companies said they take cybersecurity seriously and have made changes to improve product safety, but declined to give details.  ICS-CERT’s mandate is to help protect critical U.S. infrastructure from cyber threats, whether they are introduced through human error, virus infections, or through attacks by criminals or extremists. According to the senior DHS official, the agency started examining healthcare equipment about two years ago, when cybersecurity researchers were becoming more interested in medical devices that increasingly contained computer chips, software, wireless technology and Internet connectivity, making them more susceptible to hacking. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the sale of medical devices, recently released guidelines for manufacturers and healthcare providers to better secure medical devices and is holding its first public conference on the topic this week. “The conventional wisdom in the past was that products only had to be protected from unintentional threats. Now they also have to be protected from intentional threats too,” said William Maisel, chief scientist at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. He declined to comment on the DHS reviews. The senior DHS official said the two dozen cases currently under investigation cover a wide range of equipment, including medical imaging equipment and hospital networking systems. A DHS review does not imply the government thinks a company has done anything wrong - it means the agency is looking into a suspected vulnerability to try to help rectify it. One of the cases involves an alleged vulnerability in a type  of infusion pump, a piece of hospital equipment that delivers medication directly into a patient’s bloodstream. Private cybersecurity researcher Billy Rios said he discovered the alleged bug but declined to identify the manufacturer of the pump. Two people familiar with his research said the manufacturer was Hospira.     Rios said he wrote a program that could remotely force multiple pumps to dose patients with potentially lethal amounts of drugs. He submitted his analysis to the DHS.     “This is a issue that is going to be extremely difficult to patch,” said Rios, a former Marine platoon commander who has worked for several Silicon Valley technology firms and recently founded security startup Laconicly.      Reuters was not able to independently review his research or identify the type of pump Rios studied from Hospira’s line, which includes multiple models. Hospira spokeswoman Tareta Adams, while declining to comment on specifics, said the company is working to improve the security of its products.  “Hospira has implemented software adjustments, distributed customer communications and made a commitment to evaluate other changes going forward, while ensuring we are not adversely impacting the ability of our devices to meet hospital and patient needs, and maintain compliance with FDA product requirements,” Adams said in the statement. Hospital security officers say there is increasing awareness about cyber threats, and medical centers around the country have been shoring up networks to better defend against hackers. At the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, all medical devices will soon need to be tested to make sure they meet security standards before they can be put on the hospital’s network, according to Lessley Stoltenberg, the center’s chief information security officer. “I’m pretty concerned,” said Stoltenberg. “Coming out of the block, medical devices don’t really have security built into them.” The DHS is also reviewing suspected vulnerabilities in implantable heart devices from Medtronic and St Jude Medical, according to two people familiar with the matter. They said the probe was based in part on research by Barnaby Jack, a well-known hacker who died in July 2013. Jack had said he could hack into wireless communications systems that link implanted pacemakers and defibrillators with bedside monitors.  Medtronic spokeswoman Marie Yarroll said in an email that the company has “made changes to enhance the security” of its implantable cardiac devices, but declined to give specifics “in the interest of patient safety.” St. Jude Medical spokeswoman Candace Steele Flippin also declined to discuss specific products but said the company has “an ongoing program to perform extensive security testing on our medical devices and networked equipment. If a risk is identified, we will issue patches for any known issues.” Experts said it is important that security vulnerabilities in medical devices are exposed so manufacturers can fix them, but many said there was no need for patients to panic.  “It’s very easy to sort of sensationalize these problems,” said Kevin Fu, who runs the Archimedes Research Center for Medical Device Security at the University of Michigan. Still, worries about cybersecurity have made some individuals wary of medical devices with wireless and Internet connections. In 2007, then-U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney ordered some of the wireless features to be disabled on his defibrillator due to security concerns. When asked if he would recommend other patients do the same, Cheney said not necessarily. “You’ve got to look at all eventualities and do whatever you have to safeguard the capabilities of the individual,” Cheney told Reuters on Tuesday. “In terms of how it would affect others, I think the president and vice president are in relatively unique circumstances.” Cyber researcher Jay Radcliffe used to be among the hundreds of thousands of diabetics relying on computerized insulin pumps. He said he stopped using his Medtronic pump after he found that he could hack into its wireless communications system and potentially dump fatal doses of insulin into his body. “I don’t feel safe wearing these devices,” said Radcliffe, who works for Rapid7, a security software maker. “It’s better for me to stick myself with a needle.” Medtronic said it has made security improvements to its insulin pumps, though the company declined to give specifics. George Grunberger, who has led the insulin pump management task force of the American Association of Clinical Endocrynologists, said he believes the benefits of pumps far outweigh any cyber risks, so he would not advise patients to follow Radcliffe’s example.

247,MDT,Medtronic profit meets expectations; Covidien deal on track,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) posted a quarterly profit that was in line with analyst expectations, helped by sales of new heart devices, and said its $42.9 billion purchase of hospital products maker Covidien Plc COV.N remains on track to close early next year. Changes in U.S. tax rules aimed at curbing a spate of so-called tax inversion acquisitions have caused investors to question whether the deal would proceed after companies such as drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) and Irish competitor Shire Plc (SHP.L) dropped plans to merge. But Medtronic executives said they remain fully committed to buying Dublin-based Covidien and are focused on integration planning. “We changed our financing, but we didn’t change our plan to go forward with the transaction. It didn’t affect us as much as the other companies,” Medtronic Chief Financial Gary Ellis said in an interview.The largest stand-alone medical device maker on Tuesday said its second-quarter net earnings fell to $828 million, or 83 cents a share, from $902 million, or 89 cents, the year before. Excluding costs for the Covidien acquisition and a charitable donation, Medtronic earned 96 cents a share, in line with the average analyst forecast.  Revenue rose 4 percent to $4.37 billion, boosted by new products including a miniature implantable diagnostic monitor for the heart called Reveal and the CoreValve replacement heart valve.  The Minneapolis-based maker of defibrillators, spinal implants, insulin pumps and other products reiterated its full-year profit outlook of $4.00 to $4.10 a share, excluding items, but raised the lower end of its revenue forecast to predict a new range of 4 percent to 5 percent growth, adjusted for currency fluctuations. Medtronic in recent years has struggled with slowing growth in maturing markets for heart and spine devices. Although acquiring Covidien is expected to reduce its overall tax burden, it will also broaden its product offerings. “We’re in this environment with tough price competition, tough competitors, hospital consolidation. You want to be able to offer a complete package and win the business,” said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.     New U.S. tax rules aimed at deterring tax inversion deals mean Medtronic will need to borrow more money than it originally planned, rather than use overseas cash, to fund the deal.

249,MDT,Medtronic gets U.S. antitrust OK to buy Covidien with divestiture,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust regulators on Wednesday approved a pair of major deals in the medical field, including Medtronic’s purchase of Covidien, which will allow it to take advantage of tax breaks in Ireland. The Federal Trade Commission said it would allow medical technology company Medtronic Inc’s $42.9 billion deal to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc on condition that it sell its drug-coated balloon catheter business. The commission also approved two parts of a three-way deal between GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Novartis AG, which reflects an industry trend in which companies focus on their strongest businesses. The transaction, announced in April, calls for Britain’s GSK to buy most of the vaccines business of Novartis, the Swiss company to purchase GSK’s cancer drugs, and the two groups to team up in consumer healthcare. The FTC approved the vaccines portion of the deal and the consumer healthcare part on the condition that Novartis sell its Habitrol nicotine patch, the companies said on Wednesday. Novartis and GSK, which has Nicoderm CQ, are two of only three companies that sell nicotine patches to U.S. retailers, the FTC said. The FTC’s approval of the Covidien deal takes Minnesota-based Medtronic a step closer to moving to Ireland, where it could have access to revenues earned outside the United States without paying U.S. taxes on them.  The merger, which was announced in June, will create a company close in size to the medical device business of industry leader Johnson & Johnson. The European Union and China must still approve the deal, while Canada approved it on Wednesday, Medtronic said. Medtronic, which makes defibrillators, spinal implants, insulin pumps and other products, said previously that it expected the deal to close in early 2015.  Medtronic is the world’s largest stand-alone medical device maker, with a market value of more than $60 billion, while Covidien’s products are used in a range of surgical procedures. Colorado-based Spectranetics Corp will purchase Covidien’s drug-coated catheter business, the FTC said.

259,MDT,Fitch: Covidien's Ratings Remain on Negative Watch,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings maintains its Negative Watch on  Covidien plc's (Covidien's) ratings, including the 'A' Issuer Default Rating  (IDR), following Medtronic Inc.'s (Medtronic) recent bond issuance. The ratings  apply to approximately $5 billion of Covidien's debt outstanding at June 27,  2014.  A full list of ratings follows at the end of this press release. The proceeds of Medtronic's bond issuance will be used to partially fund the  company's planned acquisition of Covidien, anticipated to close in late 2014 or  early 2015. Fitch believes it is likely that most of Covidien's $5 billion in  notes will remain outstanding and that these notes will receive downstream  guarantees from the parent company after the acquisition. Independent of the  anticipated legal guarantees, strategic and operational linkages between  Medtronic and Covidien will be strong. Since the credit risk associated with the  Covidien notes will be substantially similar to the rest of the unsecured debt  in the capital structure, the ratings are likely to be equalized.  Fitch currently rates Covidien as follows, with all long- and short-term ratings  on Negative Watch: Covidien plc --IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'. Covidien International Finance S.A. (CIFSA) --IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'.  --Commercial paper program 'F1'; --Credit facility 'A'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A'. CIFSA, which is the obligor of Covidien's debt, is a wholly owned subsidiary of  Covidien plc. CIFSA directly or indirectly owns all of the operating  subsidiaries of Covidien, issues debt, and performs treasury operations for  Covidien, otherwise it conducts no independent business operations of its own.  CIFSA's senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by both Covidien  Ltd. and Covidien plc. Covidien plc replaced Covidien Ltd. as the ultimate  parent company in June 2009.

262,MDT,"R&D;, sales untouched as Medtronic folds in Covidien -CEO","Feb 17 (Reuters) - Medtronic Plc plans no cuts in research and development or its sales staff as the medical device maker begins the process of integrating its $49.9 billion acquisition of Covidien Plc, Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said on Tuesday. “Our commercial sales force and R&D; are not going to be affected,” Ishrak said in an interview. The company expects to generate $850 million in annual cost reductions over the next three years from the deal. Savings will be found in consolidating its corporate headquarters as well as regional administrative offices and training centers where there is overlap around the globe, Ishrak said. Human resources and purchasing are additional areas where duplication can be eliminated.

264,MDT,Medtronic profit beats estimates on heart device sales,"(Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Plc (MDT.N), which last month completed the $49.9 billion purchase of Ireland-based Covidien Plc, reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, driven by solid growth in its cardiac and vascular business. Its shares climbed 3.4 percent to $77.82 in midday trading.  The medical device industry has struggled with sluggish growth in recent years as a soft economy discouraged people from seeking healthcare and hospitals pressed suppliers for lower pricing.  Medtronic said on Tuesday its heart devices including implantable defibrillators, artificial valves and devices to treat atrial fibrillation, an irregular rhythm, contributed to a 5 percent increase in sales in the cardiac and vascular business, its largest unit. Excluding the impact of the strong U.S. dollar, sales in the division were up 10 percent. “That’s pretty strong growth given the market dynamics we are in,” said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.  Medtronic acquired Covidien to expand the range of products it can offer to hospitals, lower its global tax burden and improve access to its cash outside the United States. It forecast revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent for the combined company in the fourth quarter ending in April. If the dollar remains at its current foreign exchange rate, the impact would be a $420 million to $480 million reduction in reported fourth-quarter revenue, Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis said on a conference call. Looking ahead to its 2016 fiscal year, the company is projecting revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency basis, Ellis said.  Medtronic said it will transition to providing its earnings per share on a cash basis, which excludes amortization, starting in the fourth quarter, when it reports results for the combined company for the first time.         In the third quarter ended Jan. 23, Medtronic said its net profit rose to $977 million, or 98 cents per share, from $762 million, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Excluding charges primarily for the Covidien acquisition, Medtronic earned $1.01 per share, above the average analyst estimate of 97 cents according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Third-quarter revenue increased to $4.32 billion from $4.16 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.25 billion.  U.S. revenue rose 8 percent to $2.46 billion.

265,MDT,UPDATE 2-Medtronic profit beats estimates on heart device sales,"(Adds conference call details, analyst comment) By Susan Kelly and Amrutha Penumudi Feb 17 (Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Plc , which last month completed the $49.9 billion purchase of Ireland-based Covidien Plc, reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, driven by solid growth in its cardiac and vascular business. Its shares climbed 3.4 percent to $77.82 in midday trading. The medical device industry has struggled with sluggish growth in recent years as a soft economy discouraged people from seeking healthcare and hospitals pressed suppliers for lower pricing. Medtronic said on Tuesday its heart devices including implantable defibrillators, artificial valves and devices to treat atrial fibrillation, an irregular rhythm, contributed to a 5 percent increase in sales in the cardiac and vascular business, its largest unit. Excluding the impact of the strong U.S. dollar, sales in the division were up 10 percent. “That’s pretty strong growth given the market dynamics we are in,” said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau. Medtronic acquired Covidien to expand the range of products it can offer to hospitals, lower its global tax burden and improve access to its cash outside the United States. It forecast revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent for the combined company in the fourth quarter ending in April. If the dollar remains at its current foreign exchange rate, the impact would be a $420 million to $480 million reduction in reported fourth-quarter revenue, Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis said on a conference call. Looking ahead to its 2016 fiscal year, the company is projecting revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency basis, Ellis said. Medtronic said it will transition to providing its earnings per share on a cash basis, which excludes amortization, starting in the fourth quarter, when it reports results for the combined company for the first time. In the third quarter ended Jan. 23, Medtronic said its net profit rose to $977 million, or 98 cents per share, from $762 million, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Excluding charges primarily for the Covidien acquisition, Medtronic earned $1.01 per share, above the average analyst estimate of 97 cents according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Third-quarter revenue increased to $4.32 billion from $4.16 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.25 billion. U.S. revenue rose 8 percent to $2.46 billion. International revenue fell 2 percent to $1.86 billion, hit by the stronger dollar. Excluding the dollar’s impact, international sales increased 7 percent.

266,MDT,"US STOCKS-Futures flat, with major indexes at records","* Investors watching situations in Greece, Ukraine * S&P; 500 coming off record closing high * Crude oil rises for third straight session * Dow down 1 pt, S&P; down 1.75 pt, Nasdaq up 6.75 pts   (Updates prices, adds Transocean and Medtronic news) By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Tuesday, the first trading session after the S&P; 500 closed at a record high, although investors continued to watch the uncertainty over a Greek debt deal and a fragile Ukraine truce. Equities have been in an uptrend lately, with major indexes notching a second week of solid gains last week. Much of the advance came on signs of progress for the debt deal in Greece, as well as reduced tension between Russia and Ukraine. Both situations appeared less stable over the long weekend as U.S. stock markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday. Still investors were not spurred to sell, with equities supported by crude oil, which rose for the third straight day. In Europe, European Union finance ministers pressured Greece to remain in an international financial rescue program after talks collapsed on Monday. U.S.-listed shares of the National Bank of Greece fell 11 percent to $1.44 in heavy premarket trading. Pro-Russian separatists said they would not carry out an agreement to pull back heavy guns in eastern Ukraine, putting a shaky peace deal at risk. While the United States has little direct exposure to either Greece or Ukraine and Russia, any breakdown in either place could lead to continued volatility in Europe, a major trading partner. Crude oil rose 0.2 percent to $52.86, while Brent crude  was up 0.9 percent at $61.96 on expectations that lower prices may prompt a slowdown in U.S. output. Separately, bombings by Egypt against Islamic State targets in Libya raised concerns about a threat to Middle East supplies. Despite the rise crude oil remained sharply down from a high hit in June, severely pressured energy stocks. On Monday, offshore drilling company Transocean Ltd slashed its dividend, and its chief executive officer stepped down.  Transocean shares rose 1.7 percent to $19.38 in heavy premarket trading. Medtronic Plc added 2.3 percent to $77 premarket after the medical device maker reported earnings growth of 28 percent, boosted by higher sales of its cardiac devices. Corporate earnings have also supported the equity gains. Of the 391 S&P; 500 companies reporting results so far this quarter, about 71.1 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, while 57.5 percent have beaten on revenue. The earnings growth rate for the quarter is 6.6 percent, down from the 11.2 percent expected on Oct. 1, but up from 4.2 percent expected on Jan. 1. Futures snapshot at 8:04: * S&P; 500 e-minis were down 1.75 points, or 0.08 percent, with 209,701 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 6.75 points, or 0.15 percent, in volume of 39,776 contracts. * Dow e-minis slipped 1 points, or 0.01 percent, with 42,359 contracts changing hands.

But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the top U.S. patent appeals court, upheld the jury’s finding that NuVasive Inc’s spinal surgery devices had infringed Medtronic’s spinal implant and surgical method patents.

DreaMed will receive undisclosed royalties from future sales of each device using its technology. Medtronic will be responsible for the development and marketing of the pumps. The U.S. medical device maker has also invested $2 million in DreaMed.   DreaMed’s GlucoSitter, which is based on the MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas algorithm, is an automated system for controlling glucose levels.  It analyses the body’s glucose levels and directs the pump to deliver the correct dose of insulin to the body, mimicking the behavior of a healthy pancreas. This minimizes the risk of suffering low and high blood glucose episodes. “We believe that a fully automated artificial pancreas will provide greater freedom and better health for many people with diabetes by eliminating some of the burden of glucose management,” said Alejandro Galindo, general manager of the intensive insulin management business at Medtronic. The global market for products to manage diabetes stands at $41 billion and is estimated to surpass $114 billion by 2018. Insulin-dependent patients represent half of this market.

Medtronic, the world’s largest standalone medical device maker, has agreed to stop manufacturing and distributing the SynchroMed pumps except in extraordinary cases where a physician certifies the product is medically necessary for treatment. The proposed consent decree also requires Medtronic to retain an expert to help the company correct the regulatory violations. Medtronic said it is focused on implementing design changes to the pump and improving its neuromodulation quality system.

The preliminary quarterly results are the first to include revenue generated by Covidien Plc, which Medtronic acquired in January for $49.9 billion. The company projected revenue rose to $7.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 7 percent from a year ago on a comparable basis, aligning Covidien’s prior results with Medtronic’s quarter and excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $7.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Medtronic said fourth-quarter cash earnings, excluding charges, would be in the upper half of a range of $1.08 to $1.13. The maker of implantable heart defibrillators, stents and a wide range of other medical technologies plans to post complete results for the quarter on June 2. Fourth-quarter U.S. revenue increased 8 percent to $4.06 billion. Revenue in the cardiac and vascular group, the company’s largest business, rose 10 percent, to $2.6 billion.

287,MDT,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Medtronic profit tops views, but strong dollar a hurdle","(Corrects first paragraph to clarify the quarter was the first to include Covidien revenue) By Susan Kelly and Amrutha Penumudi June 2 (Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Plc  reported better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit on higher sales across its business lines in the first quarter to include revenue from the acquisition of surgical products provider Covidien Plc. The company, which had announced preliminary fourth-quarter revenue in May, on Tuesday also gave a fiscal 2016 profit outlook that was below analysts’ expectations, citing a greater impact from the strong U.S. dollar than the company previously estimated. Wall Street shrugged off the currency hit, with Medtronic’s shares edging slightly higher to $76.72 in midday trading. “It’s more of a foreign currency issue and not an operational issue, so people will view the guidance as in line,” said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau. “Overall it looks like the product portfolio is doing well and they are doing a nice job integrating the Covidien business.” The company has introduced several new products, including the Reveal Linq insertable heart monitor and a less-invasive replacement heart valve called CoreValve, that have helped accelerate sales growth. “We’ve had a convergence of new product launches in the last 12 months that we haven’t had for a long time,” Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said in an interview. Demand for medical procedures is also picking up in general as the economy improves, Ishrak said.

The deal, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, marks Bayer’s second attempt to divest the blood glucose monitoring business which has brands such as Contour, Breeze, Elite and Microlet. Bayer tried to find a buyer for the business in 2012 and revived efforts to sell it in November. The industry as a whole has been grappling with increased competition and pressure to cut reimbursements from public-sector medical insurers. The company’s annual report said the Diabetes Care unit was hit by reimbursement pressure and price decreases in the United States last year. The business had 909 million euros in sales last year and collaborates with U.S. medical technology company Medtronic. Panasonic Healthcare, also a maker of blood glucose meters, said in a statement the combined business would use its size to offer more affordable devices in response to a overall decline in prices and growing volumes in the industry. Rivals in the market for glucose meters include Abbott , Roche’s diagnostics division and Johnson & Johnson’s Lifescan unit. The sale is part of Bayer’s efforts to overhaul its structure, which includes plans to list its plastics business on the stock market to free up money for investments and acquisitions in healthcare, veterinary drugs and crop protection products.

293,MDT,UPDATE 2-Medtronic sales surge as rise in U.S. surgeries drives demand,"* Revenue tops estimates on new product sales, U.S. demand * Cardiac, vascular unit sales up 14 pct, up 33 pct in U.S. * Says well placed to benefit from bundle payment program * CEO “feels we’ve outperformed the overall market” in China * Stock little changed in midday trading   (Adds CEO and analyst comment, details from conference call) By Natalie Grover Sept 3 (Reuters) - Medtronic Plc, the world’s largest standalone medical device maker, reported a 70 percent rise in quarterly revenue, helped by higher sales across its business lines, in part due to the acquisition of surgical products provider Covidien Plc. An improving U.S. economy and the impact of the affordable care act has driven an increase in the number of surgical procedures, boosting demand for Medtronic’s products, the company said. Medtronic said it is well positioned to benefit from the Medicare bundle payment program, which aims to link payments for multiple services during an episode of care rather than pay providers separately for each service. The $50 billion Covidien deal, which closed in January, helped expand the range of products Medtronic offers hospitals, as well as cut its tax burden. Medtronic’s revenue rose to $7.27 billion in the first quarter, which included an extra week, from $4.27 billion a year earlier. Sales in its cardiac and vascular business, which makes pace-makers, heart valves and stents, climbed 14 percent to $2.57 billion in the quarter ended July 31. In the United States alone, sales jumped about 33 percent. Sales of ICDs, used to treat irregular heartbeat, increased in the high single digit percentage range, adjusting for the extra week, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said. The growth was in stark contrast to the soft results reported by the company’s peers, Kumar noted. Medtronic’s revenue from the minimally invasive therapies group, created after the Covidien deal, raked in sales of $2.46 billion, challenging the cardiac business as the company’s top revenue contributor. The company’s diversified position allows them to expect a “sort of double-digit type” growth in emerging markets, Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said in a conference call. “We had low double-digit growth in China which actually is better than what we’ve been seeing in most quarters last year,” he said. “We feel that we’ve outperformed the overall market.” The company’s adjusted profit rose 47 percent to $1.46 billion, or $1.02 per share, in the first quarter. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.01 per share on revenue of $7.06 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Medtronic reiterated its fiscal 2016 profit forecast of $4.30-$4.40 per share, including a 40-50 cents impact from currency fluctuations. It also reaffirmed its forecast of 4-6 percent revenue growth on a constant currency basis in 2016. The company’s stock was little changed at $71.42 in midday trade.

299,MDT,Market for new heart valve device could take years to build,"CHICAGO, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Top medical device makers are investing heavily in a new way to treat leaky mitral heart valves, a serious condition affecting millions of people, but it will be at least four years before the technology reaches the U.S. market. The minimally invasive treatment, called transcatheter mitral valve replacement, lets a doctor implant an artificial valve using a catheter inserted through the arteries. The technique spares the patient from open-heart surgery, the traditional approach to valve replacement that is considered too risky for many people, especially the elderly. Medtronic Plc, Abbott Laboratories, Edwards Lifesciences Corp and HeartWare International Inc  in recent months have spent a total of $2 billion to buy young companies developing versions of the technology. Boston Scientific Corp has an option to buy an early-stage company developing a mitral replacement system. Nearly 6 million people in the United States may suffer from mitral disease, and Wall Street analysts say it could be the next multibillion-dollar market. But the rush by leading device makers into mitral replacement has raised questions for some investors and heart doctors. Fewer than 100 people worldwide have undergone the procedure, and it is far from clear whether this technique will be significantly better than other treatments or how many patients would be candidates for the surgery. “All these things are still several years away, especially from the U.S. market,” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli & Co, which holds shares of Medtronic. Mitral disease is “something that very gradually develops. A ton of people may have it, but a smaller number have it at a life-threatening stage.” The mitral valve helps regulate blood flow from the heart’s left atrium into the left ventricle. Mitral valve regurgitation occurs when the valve does not close properly to prevent backflow. It can cause extreme fatigue and shortness of breath and increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and death. “If we have a way where we can replace the valve without surgery, that is where all the excitement is,” said Dr. Mathew Williams, chief of cardiac surgery at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. Abbott’s MitraClip is the only minimally invasive product on the U.S. market for the condition. It repairs, rather than replaces, a patient’s own mitral valve. It is approved for a limited group of severely ill patients and its performance improves when certain anatomical characteristics are present. Annual sales are about $250 million worldwide. Abbott sees room for both repair and replacement in treating mitral disease and projects strong double-digit annual growth for the MitraClip over the next several years, said John Capek, a company executive vice president. Rivals Edwards and Medtronic have found huge success with a minimally invasive technique for replacing malfunctioning aortic valves, and some see that as a benchmark for the mitral market. Edwards projects the aortic market will grow to $3 billion in worldwide sales in five years, double its 2014 sales, driven by advancements in the technology and approvals to treat additional patient populations. Some Wall Street analysts, including Morgan Stanley’s David Lewis, predict the mitral market could be two to three times larger because more patients have mitral valve disease than aortic. “What you’ve got is this huge market opportunity. But the challenges are huge, and it’s going to take some time,” said Edwards Chief Executive Michael Mussallem. Edwards may be the first to launch a transcatheter replacement product in Europe, possibly by late 2017, with a U.S. approval possible by 2019. Replacing a mitral valve is particularly tricky, partly due to the valve’s asymmetrical structure, which varies by patient and is more difficult to address than the circular aortic valve, according to doctors. It can also be tougher to guide a mitral valve to the heart through the arteries because of its larger size, and harder to reach the original valve due to its location. Results will not come until the end of 2017 from a key study enrolling up to 430 patients to determine whether repairing the valve using Abbott’s MitraClip is better than medications alone. Doctors say the research could bolster the case for minimally invasive approaches if the results support the procedure’s effectiveness. Patients with mitral valve regurgitation often take medicines used to treat heart failure, but these do not correct the valve condition. “It is a very interesting space, and there is a need for mitral valve replacement,” said Dr. Saibal Kar, director of interventional cardiac research at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. But he cautioned it is much too early to predict it will become the industry’s next multi-billion-dollar market. “It is unbridled enthusiasm,” he said.

300,MDT,Medical device maker Medtronic's profit beats estimates,"(Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by higher sales in all of its divisions, and the Dublin-based company raised the lower-end of its full-year profit forecast. The world’s largest stand-alone medical device maker, whose shares were up 1.5 percent in premarket trading, also said it expected fiscal 2016 revenue to increase by a high mid-single digit percentage. It had earlier forecast growth of 4-6 percent. Medtronic, known for its pacemakers, said it now expected an adjusted profit of $4.33-$4.40 per share for 2016. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $4.36 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. An improving U.S. economy and the impact of the Affordable Care Act - popularly known as Obamacare - has increased the number of surgical procedures, boosting demand for Medtronic’s products. Sales generated by surgical products provider Covidien, which Medtronic bought in January for nearly $50 billion, contributed about a third of the company’s total revenue in the second-quarter ended Oct. 30. Medtronic said device sales in the United States increased 6 percent and accounted for more than half of the company’s revenue in the latest quarter. Revenue rose 62 percent to $7.06 billion, including sales from Covidien, matching the average analyst estimate.

306,MDT,Medtronic shares slump as third-quarter operating margin disappoints,"(Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) on Tuesday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings in line with expectations, but its shares shed over 5 percent in early trade after the company said the strong dollar pressured its operating margin. Investors are focusing on operating margin, a measure of profit, as a gauge of how well Medtronic is absorbing Covidien, which it acquired in January 2015 for nearly $50 billion.  “Right or wrong, it is the number that investors are looking at to judge the integration of Covidien, as a marker for how well the expenses are being controlled,” said Jefferies & Co analyst Raj Denhoy. Medtronic’s adjusted operating margin of 27.8 percent was slightly below expectations of 28 percent to 28.5 percent, Denhoy said. The company, the world’s largest standalone medical device maker, attributed the shortfall to foreign currency translations, particularly in Argentina, where the peso plunged by 30 percent against the U.S. dollar in December alone. But executives stressed the company is making significant progress toward achieving its cost savings target of $850 million over three years. “The improvement we are seeing on the operating side of the equation is more than being offset by foreign exchange impact,” Medtronic Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis said in an interview. Medtronic’s net income rose to $1.10 billion in the third quarter ended Jan. 29, up from $977 million a year earlier. Earnings excluding one-time items of $1.06 per share matched analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $6.93 billion, up 6 percent when adjusted for currency impacts and the Covidien acquisition, helped by higher sales of implanted heart defibrillators, pacemakers, stents and artificial valves, and devices to treat atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat. Sales in the cardiac and vascular group unit, Medtronic’s largest business, rose 7 percent excluding foreign exchange impact, to $2.41 billion. “The markets are good, our products are taking (market) share right now and we have a pipeline of products to continue that journey,” said Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak. Dublin-based Medtronic also reiterated its adjusted full-year earnings forecast of $4.36 to $4.40 per share.

310,MDT,UPDATE 1-Medtronic's wireless pacemaker wins U.S FDA nod,"(Adds details, background) April 6 (Reuters) - Medtronic Plc’s wireless pacemaker was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday, making it the first pacemaker in the United States that does not need wired leads to correct slow heart rates. The Micra pacemaker is delivered to the heart chambers through arteries using a catheter, unlike traditional pacemakers that are implanted through an incision and connected to the heart with a wired lead. The Micra pacemaker works without using a lead wire, eliminating the serious complications that can arise once the implanted leads wear out or get infected. The FDA evaluated data from a clinical trial involving 719 and found that 98 percent of patients had a stable heart pacing for at least six months after the device was implanted, the health regulator said in a statement. (1.usa.gov/23iwftQ) Less than 7 percent of the patients implanted with the device showed complications such as prolonged hospitalizations, blood clots in the legs and lungs and heart injury, the FDA said. The MRI-safe Micra pacemaker was approved in the Europe in 2015. St.Jude Medical Inc received European approval for its MRI-compatible leadless pacemaker in March. MRI scans generate powerful radiations and patients with pacemakers are advised not to undergo the procedure. Medtronic’s shares closed up 2 percent at $77.31 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. They were up less than a percent in extended trading.

The world’s largest standalone medical device maker, which has struggled with the effects of the rising dollar on its overseas sales, said it expected full-year 2017 adjusted earnings of $4.60 to $4.70 per share.  Analysts on average were forecasting $4.70 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Company executives said the outlook takes into account the impact of the strong dollar, which can pinch profit margins on goods sold overseas. Shares fell almost 2 percent in morning trade as investors worried about the possibility of softer-than-expected operating margins going forward. “Continued lack of sustainable positive operating leverage in line with expectations could be a focus of investors,” Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said in a note to clients.

325,MDT,Medtronic expects revenue from surgical robot in fiscal 2019,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Plc, the world’s largest standalone medical device maker, said on Monday it expects a robotic surgical system it is developing to make a meaningful contribution to company revenue beginning in fiscal 2019. Medtronic will launch the surgical robot before the 2019 fiscal year, with the first systems to roll out in India, said Bryan Hanson, head of the minimally invasive therapies group. The robot will generate “material revenue” in fiscal 2019, Hanson said in the company’s investor day presentation.  In robotically assisted surgery, the surgeon guides the robot’s mechanical arms from a computer console. The approach requires smaller incisions than traditional open surgery and is increasingly used in procedures such as prostate removal and hysterectomy. When launched, Medtronic’s robot will compete with Intuitive Surgical Inc’s da Vinci system, the only robot for abdominal surgery now on the market. It is also expected to face competition from Verb Surgical, a startup backed by Johnson & Johnson and Alphabet Inc’s Google that is developing its own robot.  Medtronic’s offering will aim to lower costs associated with robotic surgery. “It is costly today. We are going to be looking to eliminate that as a barrier,” Hanson said.   Minneapolis-based Medtronic has 150 employees working on its robotic system across locations in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Colorado, and Germany, he added. The company, whose products range from pacemakers and heart valves to spinal implants, also announced plans to introduce its first hip and knee replacement devices as part of an Orthopedic Solutions offering for hospitals adjusting to a new Medicare bundled payment program.  The Medicare plan ties reimbursement to quality and spending targets for the procedure and a recovery period after the patient leaves the hospital. Medtronic said it has acquired a company, Responsive Orthopedics, that will make the devices. It expects to have a knee available in the first half of 2017 and a hip the following year. The company is providing input to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on a possible bundled payment plan for cardiovascular surgery, with the aim of reducing hospital re-admissions through better patient monitoring, executives said. In diabetes management, Medtronic said it plans to apply by the end of June for U.S. approval to sell the first “hybrid closed loop” insulin pump that adjusts insulin delivery when a high glucose reading is detected and suspends it in response to a low level.

333,MDT,NuVasive settles spinal surgery patent fight with Medtronic,"(Reuters) - Medical device maker NuVasive Inc will pay rival Medtronic Plc $45 million to settle a longstanding patent fight related to spinal surgery technology, NuVasive said on Thursday. The deal will end litigation that began in 2008 in federal court in California, the company said in a federal filing. The litigation led to a jury verdict finding both companies liable for patent infringement. The companies will also put to rest any challenges to the validity of each other’s patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and both sides have agreed not to sue each other over patents related to spinal implants and nerve monitoring technology for seven years, NuVasive said. “We are very pleased to have negotiated a mutually agreeable settlement that removes the ongoing burden of this litigation and provides for a framework for resolution of potential patent disputes in the future,” NuVasive Chief Executive Gregory Lucier said in a statement. Medtronic spokesman Eric Epperson said, “We look forward to continue focusing our efforts on accelerating innovations that transform spine surgery and improve outcomes for more patients.” The patent fight included a couple of rounds at a federal appeals court and a brief trip to the U.S. Supreme Court. It began when Warsaw Orthopedic Inc, a subsidiary of Dublin-headquartered Medtronic, filed suit in 2008 against San Diego-based NuVasive for infringement of Medtronic’s spinal implant and surgical method patents. NuVasive countersued, accusing Medtronic of infringing its patent on technology that gives doctors a way to detect and avoid damaging spinal nerves during surgery. A jury found both sides liable, awarding $101.2 million in damages to Medtronic, and $660,000 to NuVasive.

Medtronic now expects adjusted earnings of $4.55 to $4.60 per share for the fiscal year ending April 28, 2017, down from its prior view of $4.60 to $4.70. It sees percentage revenue growth for the second half of fiscal 2017 in the mid-single digit range.  Chief Executive Omar Ishrak acknowledged that the quarterly results were “disappointing,” placing the blame on a confluence of what he said were temporary factors. But investors were not in a forgiving mood, taking the company’s share price down $6.98, or 8.7 percent, to $73.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. Ishrak cited weak sales in the Middle East as governments there deal with diminished purchasing power caused by low oil prices, as well as limits imposed by UK regulators on bulk purchases. Sales of cardiovascular and diabetes products and minimally invasive therapies all missed analysts’ expectations. The cardiac and vascular unit, whose products include defibrillators, pacemakers, heart valves and stents, posted sales of $2.58 billion for the quarter, below expectations of $2.64 billion. “Top line growth slowed fairly dramatically,” said Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy, noting that the company was coming off more than two years of strong demand for newer products. “We’re seeing those really strong product cycles start to wane and it’s going to be a couple of quarters again before some of the new things will start to contribute,” Denhoy said. Among the most important future growth drivers is Medtronic’s MiniMed 670G “artificial pancreas” in which a glucose sensor communicates with an insulin pump to automatically regulate insulin flow. The device received an earlier-than-expected U.S. approval and the company plans to begin selling it in the spring. Ishrak, on a conference call with analysts, said the launch of 15 surgical products and the MiniMed 670G “will give us enough growth to take us well within the mid single-digit range” for fiscal 2017 revenue. Improvement in the back half of the year is essential,  Cowen & Co analysts said, adding that they remained optimistic the company would rebound. Total revenue rose 4 percent to $7.35 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $7.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The state planner said it had fined Medtronic (Shanghai) Management Co following an investigation into monopolistic behavior related to the firm’s cardiovascular and diabetes medical device products. The NDRC said Medtronic had carried out monopolistic behavior with its distributors and local partners to fix prices and set lower limits on the resale price to hospitals. “We can confirm that Medtronic was investigated by China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) related to the country’s anti-monopoly law, and Medtronic accepts the NDRC’s decision,” a company spokesman said in emailed comments. “We are absolutely committed to ensuring that we are in full compliance with local laws and regulations.” China has fined car makers, drug manufacturers and white goods firms over the last year for price fixing, while medical device makers came under the spotlight as far back as 2013. Foreign firms from the United States, Japan and Europe still dominate China’s medical devices market, although China has said it wants to create domestic champions in the sector.

359,MDT,Medtronic must face revived U.S. lawsuit over Infuse,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday revived a lawsuit accusing Medtronic Plc of defrauding shareholders by covering up negative side effects from its Infuse bone growth product for nearly a decade. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Paul, Minnesota said a lower court judge erred in finding that the plaintiff shareholders sued too late, by waiting more than two years after learning information that could suggest an intent to defraud. Medtronic did not respond to requests for comment. The plaintiffs include the West Virginia Pipe Trades Health and Welfare Fund, the Employees’ Retirement System of the State of Hawaii and Germany’s Union Asset Management Holding AG. Medtronic developed Infuse as an alternative to bone grafts, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it for use in some lower back spinal surgeries in 2002. But off-label uses of Infuse eventually comprised 85 percent of sales. The FDA in 2008 warned against such uses, following reports of life-threatening complications. Three years later, a June 28, 2011 article in The Spine Journal said clinical studies by doctors with financial ties to Medtronic understated Infuse’s risks. Then in October 2012, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee found that Medtronic was “heavily involved” in shaping the content of such studies. Shareholders sued Medtronic on June 27, 2013, saying its activities inflated the company’s stock price, and caused them to lose hundreds of millions of dollars as the truth came out. In Wednesday’s decision, Circuit Judge Raymond Gruender said it was not until The Spine Journal article was published that reasonable shareholders might have inferred that problems with Medtronic’s studies reflected an intent to defraud. Gruender also said shareholders properly alleged that they relied on Medtronic’s alleged misconduct. “A company cannot instruct individuals to take a certain action, pay to induce them to do it, and then claim any causal connection is too remote when they follow through,” he wrote. “In this way,” the judge continued, “Medtronic’s alleged manipulative conduct directly caused the biased clinical trial results that the market relied upon.” Shawn Williams, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he was pleased with the decision, which returns the case to the lower court for further proceedings. Medtronic is now based in Ireland, but has offices in Minneapolis. In March 2012, the company agreed to pay $85 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit claiming it concealed the extent of Infuse's off-label use.

360,MDT,Abbott gets U.S. antitrust approval to buy St. Jude Medical,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Healthcare company Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) has won U.S. antitrust approval for its proposed $25 billion acquisition of medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday. Abbott agreed to divest two medical devices used in cardiovascular procedures to resolve FTC concerns the acquisition would stifle competition, the commission said in a statement. “We continue to work to obtain final regulatory approvals and anticipate closing before the end of the year or shortly thereafter,” Abbott spokeswoman Elissa Maurer said in an email. The company will sell St. Jude’s vascular closure device and Abbott’s steerable sheath to Japan-based Terumo Corp (4543.T). In October, Abbott said the companies would sell some of their medical device businesses to Terumo for about $1.12 billion as a step toward completing the deal. Vascular closure devices are used to seal small holes made in an artery to prevent bleeding following a coronary angiogram, a special x-ray to see if coronary arteries are blocked or narrowed. Steerable sheaths are used to help place catheters into the heart. European antitrust enforcers agreed to the deal in November provided the companies divest the two devices. Representatives for Abbott and St. Jude were not immediately available for comment. Abbott has said the deal will help it compete against larger rivals Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) and Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) as hospitals look to cut the number of their suppliers.           St. Jude has been under pressure after short-seller Muddy Waters and research firm MedSec Holdings said in August that its heart devices were riddled with defects that make them vulnerable to cyber hacks. St. Jude has denied the allegations and sued both firms. In October, St. Jude said it had told doctors to stop implants of its Nanostim leadless cardiac pacemaker, citing reports of problems with electronic data reporting caused by a battery malfunction that could put patients at risk. There have been no reports that any patient injuries resulted from the malfunction, St. Jude has said. Abbott has been divesting businesses to focus on its cardiovascular devices and diagnostics business, selling its medical optics division to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) for $4.3 billion earlier this year. It spun off its pharmaceuticals business as AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) in 2013. Abbott is trying to pull out of a second deal, the $5.8 billion acquisition of diagnostic test maker Alere Inc ALR.N, which had failed to file financial statements and disclosed probes into billing and foreign sales practices. The two companies are suing each other. ",12282016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-stjude-m-a-abbott/abbott-gets-u-s-antitrust-approval-to-buy-st-jude-medical-idUSKBN14G1LD

372,MDT,"Medtronic's sales, profit beat estimates; shares rise","(Reuters) - Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) reported quarterly sales and profit above Wall Street estimates, driven by higher demand for its heart, vascular and minimally invasive products. The medical device maker’s shares rose as much as 2.7 percent to $80.98. Medtronic, which gets most of its sales from heart devices, spinal implants and insulin pumps, has been making deals to push into the minimally invasive surgical products market. In August, Medtronic closed its $1.1 billion deal for HeartWare International Inc, and has also bought a stake in Israeli robotics company Mazor Robotics Ltd (MZOR.TA) (MZOR.O). Among the most important future growth drivers is Medtronic’s MiniMed 670G “artificial pancreas”, which won U.S. approval in September, and is the first device to automatically deliver the right dose of insulin to patients with type 1 diabetes. “We remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth and double-digit constant currency earnings growth, not only in the current fiscal year but also into the future,” Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said on a post-earnings conference call. Medtronic said it expects a $20 million-$40 million hit on sales in the fourth quarter due to a strong dollar. Medtronic’s net sales rose 5 percent to $7.28 billion in the third quarter ended Jan. 27, beating the average analyst estimate of $7.22 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in Medtronic’s cardiac and vascular unit rose 5 percent to $2.55 billion, accounting for about 35 percent of the company’s total sales. Sales of surgical solutions increased 6 percent to $1.34 billion, driven by growth in open-to-minimally invasive products. Medtronic’s third-quarter results were solid, given the amount of negativity around the company’s results in the preceding quarter, Evercore ISI analysts said. In November, Medtronic reported quarterly sales below analyst estimates for virtually all its major product lines. Leerink Partners analysts said the latest results could suggest some stabilization in businesses that were the primary culprits of last quarter’s miss. Net income attributable to Medtronic fell 25.4 percent to $821 million, or 59 cents per share, in the third quarter, from a year earlier.

379,MDT,U.S. medtech shares gain as investors seek shelter from drug price debate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are seeking shelter in shares of U.S. medical device and supply companies, encouraged by their solid growth prospects and wary that President Donald Trump’s criticism of drug prices makes owning pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks risky. Shares of such medtech companies including cardiovascular devices maker Boston Scientific (BSX.N) and medical products supplier Baxter (BAX.N) have posted strong gains to start 2017. The S&P; 500 healthcare equipment index .SPLRCMED has climbed 14 percent in 2017, topping the 10 percent rise for the broad S&P; 500 healthcare sector .SPXHC and 6 percent gain for the overall S&P; 500 .SPX.  The industry represents a way to bet on increasing medical procedures as the population ages, while potentially avoiding political risks. “They are putting up good numbers from a growth perspective and they seem like they’re in a little cocoon from the political drug pricing debate,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer of Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina, whose holdings include diversified medical device maker Medtronic (MDT.N) and diagnostics company Hologic (HOLX.O). For much of last year, medtech’s relative strength was even more apparent. Healthcare and biotech were out of favor as investors were concerned that Hillary Clinton would enact drug pricing reform if she won the presidential election. So far this year, healthcare overall and biotech in particular have rebounded somewhat. But Trump’s criticisms about high drug prices are keeping investors on edge, and medtech is outperforming again. In January, the president said drug companies were “getting away with murder” in what they charge. Trump tweeted last week that he was working on a “new system” to reduce prices. While Nasdaq-listed biotech shares  .NBI dropped 1.5 percent that day, the medical devices index slipped only 0.2 percent and actually fell less than the broader market. “We do think it still represents a safer avenue to participate in healthcare,” said George Strietmann, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor in Cincinnati, whose growth fund is more heavily invested in the medtech sector than in pharmaceuticals. Investors may have to pay up for that safety. The S&P; 500 healthcare equipment index is trading at nearly 19.5 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, above its five-year average of 16.6 times, according to Thomson Reuters data. By contrast, an S&P; 500 index of pharmaceutical companies .SPLRCCARD is trading at 15.8 times forward earnings estimates and an index of S&P; 500 biotech companies .SPLRCTKBI is trading at 13.9 times.  While increasing drug prices take the spotlight, pricing in the major medical device markets has generally been declining in recent years, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro said. Although those pricing declines and the strong dollar stand to pressure the industry’s revenue, key markets such as pacemakers, spinal implants and knee and hip replacements should post volume growth of around 5 percent this year, similar to 2016, Novarro said. Investors will avoid “medtech if there’s any sense of incremental pricing pressure or volume slowdowns,” Novarro said.

381,MDT,Medtronic heart valve replacement succeeds in intermediate-risk patients: study,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Medtronic Plc’s non-invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) system proved as safe as traditional surgery in intermediate-risk patients in a two-year study presented on Friday, paving the way for its use in a wider patient population. Medtronic’s TAVR systems succeeded in demonstrating non-inferiority with no statistically significant difference in a combination of all-cause mortality and disabling stroke. The rate was 12.6 percent for TAVR and 14 percent for surgical valve replacement. For death rates alone, the two procedures were virtually identical at 11.4 percent for TAVR and 11.6 percent for surgery. For disabling stroke the difference was more pronounced at 2.6 percent for TAVR and 4.5 percent for surgery, which researchers said just missed statistical significance. “These are excellent, outstanding results,” said Dr. Michael Reardon, the study’s co-primary investigator who presented the results at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington. TAVR systems, which spare patients open heart surgery to replace a diseased aortic valve, are considered among the most important growth drivers for Medtronic and rival Edwards Lifesciences Corp. Both companies have U.S. approvals for use in patients deemed too frail or at high-risk from surgery. Edwards also has U.S. approval in intermediate-risk patients, or those seen as having 3-15 percent chance of not surviving surgery. Allowing TAVR use in larger groups of patients is considered critical to sales growth. In the more than 1,600-patient trial, 84 percent of the TAVR patients received Medtronic’s CoreValve system and 16 percent the smaller second generation Evolut. “I believe this will lead to rapid approval by the FDA for CoreValve and Evolut in intermediate-risk patients,” said Reardon, professor of cardiothorasic surgery at the Houston Methodist Debakey Heart and Vascular center. He said clinical guidelines should be changed to allow TAVR use for more patients. In a previous trial in high-risk patients, CoreValve proved superior to surgery rather than simply non-inferior. Reardon said that did not happen this time primarily because of how well the surgery patients fared. “This was the lowest surgical mortality we’ve seen in a randomized trial,” he explained. “And TAVR did just as well.” In the first 30 days, patients treated with TAVR experienced  lower rates of stroke, of new atrial fibrillation, less acute kidney injury, fewer transfusions and reported improved quality of life, researchers found.  “We found exceedingly low mortality at one and two years, which should give us great confidence as we move into lower risk (patients),” Reardon said.

386,MDT,Exclusive: Cardinal Health nears $6 billion deal for Medtronic unit - sources,"(Reuters) - U.S. drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N) is nearing a deal to acquire medical device maker Medtronic Plc’s (MDT.N) medical supplies business for close to $6 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.  The sale would streamline Medtronic’s portfolio after its $42.9 billion acquisition of Covidien Plc in 2014. In that deal, it inherited most of the company’s medical supplies business, which sells everything from syringes to surgical instruments. Medtronic and Cardinal Health have entered into exclusive talks over the sale of the business, and a deal could be announced later this month, the sources said, cautioning that there was always a chance that the negotiations could end unsuccessfully. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Medtronic and Cardinal Health declined to comment.  For Cardinal Health, the deal would boost efforts to build out its medical products business, which it has highlighted as a priority for dealmaking. “Certainly a part of the equation for us is how we use our balance sheet, and that may be through activities that are available external to us and the other ways that we deploy capital,” George Barrett, Cardinal Health’s chief executive officer, said last month on the company’s most recent quarterly earnings call.  In 2015, Cardinal Health acquired Cordis from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) for around $2 billion, adding a portfolio of devices including catheters, filters and stents. Cardinal Health’s medical products business has been a bright spot for the company, on track to reach mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth, at a time when investors have become more anxious about its drug distribution business.  This is because the entire drug supply chain, including pharmaceutical benefits managers and drugmakers, has been under pressure in recent years, amid increasing scrutiny among lawmakers and insurance companies over high drug costs. Cardinal Health, along with its peers McKesson Corp (MCK.N) and AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N), late last year saw their shares drop after McKesson said that competition was weighing on margins more than expected. Cardinal Health’s share price has since recovered, despite it having lowered expectations for full-year earnings in its pharma segment.

392,MDT,Medtronic recalls devices used to manage fluid build-up in the brain,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Plc said on Thursday it was recalling devices used to manage build-up of the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain due to increased complaints. Medtronic’s StrataMR adjustable valves and shunts are used in the management of hydrocephalus or ‘water on the brain’. Cerebrospinal fluid acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain’s cortex, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The company said it was conducting the voluntary recall due to an issue that can occur after implantation, potentially leading to under-drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. The medical device maker said the affected StrataMR valves and shunts were manufactured from Oct. 27, 2015 to Nov. 11, 2016.",4072017,http://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-recall/medtronic-recalls-devices-used-to-manage-fluid-build-up-in-the-brain-idUSL1N1HF1Q4

Goldman Sachs lost 4.7 percent to $215.59, after hitting its lowest intraday level since Nov. 29. The bank posted earnings that missed expectations as trading revenue dropped. Goldman shares suffered their biggest daily percentage drop since June 24, a day after Britain voted to leave the European Union. Johnson & Johnson slumped 3.1 percent for its worst day in 14 months after quarterly revenue fell short of analysts’ expectations. “The Goldman numbers today were disappointing to the market, in what hasn’t been a bad group of numbers for most of the banks,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “There was some optimism for greater top-line growth and we have seen in the early numbers that have come out that companies have certainly learned how to cost cut and manage the bottom line but they really are having trouble growing the top line.” Healthcare, down 1 percent, and financials, off 0.8 percent, were the two worst-performing of the 11 major S&P; sectors. Cardinal Health, down 11.5 percent, also weighed on healthcare after a disappointing profit forecast overshadowed a deal to buy medical supplies businesses from Medtronic for $6.1 billion. Although Bank of America reported a better-than-expected profit, its shares reversed course to close slightly lower, falling in line with the broader market. A rough start to the earnings season could add to investor concerns about market valuations after a strong post-election rally largely based on expectations of pro-growth policies from President Donald Trump’s administration drove major indexes to record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 113.64 points, or 0.55 percent, to 20,523.28, the S&P; 500 lost 6.83 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,342.18 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.32 points, or 0.12 percent, to 5,849.47. Safe-havens continued to be in favor, with gold and U.S. Treasury prices climbing ahead of crucial presidential elections in France, rising tensions between the United States and North Korea and the calling of early elections in Britain. Despite the high-profile earnings misses, first-quarter results have been promising overall. According to Thomson Reuters data through Tuesday morning, of the 45 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported results, 76 percent have topped expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 40 new highs and 59 new lows.

398,MDT,Fitch Revises Cardinal Health's Outlook to Negative Following $6B Deal,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK/BUENOS AIRES, April 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has revised Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (Cardinal, NYSE: CAH) Rating Outlook to Negative from Stable following the announcement that it had agreed to acquire certain assets from Medtronic (Not Rated) for approximately $6 billion. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that Cardinal's leverage will remain elevated for the rating category for an extended period of time pro forma for the acquisition of certain assets from Medtronic's Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses for approximately $6 billion. The assets were originally acquired by Medtronic as part of the Covidien acquisition in 2015. ACCELERATING GROWTH IN THE MEDICAL SEGMENT The transaction follows other smaller acquisitions in recent years to grow the medical segment (10% of FY2016 revenues) and will build on the Cordis acquisition of cardiovascular and endovascular medical devices and supplies in 2015 for $1.9 billion. Cardinal has been focused on growing its medical business and increasing its penetration of ""preferred products"" which often carry Cardinal's logo and may be produced by Cardinal itself. Successful implementation of vertically integrated transactions could result in growing penetration of preferred / generic-like product driving margin expansion and cash flows, expose the company to increased business risk from product liability and potential channel conflicts with other suppliers. Fitch expected that Cardinal would continue to invest in the medical segment, though not to this degree. At approximately $6 billion, the transaction exceeds the $4 billion spent cumulatively since 2012 on related assets including Cordis and AssuraMed. LEVERAGE SUSTAINING ABOVE SENSITIVITES Fitch projects leverage will increase towards 2.4x (gross debt/operating EBITDA after associates) and decline towards 1.9x by FY2020 as compared to Fitch's previous expectations of low- to mid-1x range through FY2020. The revision in Outlook to Negative, rather than a downgrade to 'BBB' reflect that leverage will approach the high end of the range by the second full year of contributions and CAH has some flexibility with capital deployment priorities given Fitch's assumption of $500 million per year of incremental acquisitions, $300 million per year of share repurchases, and a 5% growth rate in the common dividend. The issuer could choose not to invest to this degree though it would likely manifest as a larger cash balance given the lack of debt maturing for CAH to repay beyond what is already maturing. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's ratings case forecast incorporates the following assumptions: --Revenue growth of 7.5% in 2017 and 4%-6% in 2018-2020. Solid top-line growth in fiscal 2017 is due in large part to M&A; (Harvard, Metro, Cordis) and new customers (OptumRx). The 2018 growth rate assumes a 4% run rate in the existing business plus three quarters' worth of contributions from the transaction. --EBITDA margin declines in excess of 10bps in fiscal 2017 and 2018 in existing business lines offset by higher margins in the acquired businesses. Moderate margin pressures in fiscal 2017 - 2018 are from lower branded-drug price inflation, heightened competitive pressures particularly among independent pharmacy customers, and the addition of the OptumRx business (which likely carries lower margins than the overall business). Upside is associated with the pacing of growth in Cardinal's Medical segment strategy and/or the abatement of currently prevailing drug pricing dynamics. --FFO approximating $2.3 billion in 2017 and $2.4 billion in 2018. Cash generation is expected to be slightly less favorably affected by working capital in 2017- 2018, but growing EBITDA will drive growing FFO over the ratings horizon, growing toward $3 billion through 2020. FCF is expected to approximate $1.2 billion-$1.6 billion per year after capital expenditures of 0.4% of revenues, $500 million of acquisitions in excess of the transaction, common dividends growing by 5% per year, and approximately $300 million of share repurchases. --Gross debt/EBITDA of approximately 2.4x in FY2018 reflecting partial-year contributions, declining to 2x and 1.9x in FY2019 and FY2020, respectively. RATING SENSITIVITIES A downgrade to 'BBB' could result from an additional leveraging transaction that causes debt leverage to be sustained above 2x for more than 12-18 months. Debt-funded shareholder-friendly activities or material operational issues, particularly related to Cardinal's Medical segment strategy, could also precipitate a negative rating action. Evidence or anticipation of material margin pressure (either buy-side or sell-side) greater and more direct than currently expected could also pressure ratings. Negative rating actions are not expected to result just from recent shifts in the industry's competitive and pricing dynamics - namely lower branded inflation and key contract renewals. A revision of the Outlook to Stable and maintenance of a 'BBB+' Issuer Default Rating will require gross debt/EBITDA generally between 1.4x and 2x, accompanied by continued robust cash flows and stable or growing margins over the ratings horizon. Fitch has widened the leverage range from 1.4x-1.8x to 1.4x-2x to better reflect the issuer's improving scale, diversification and current business profile as being largely commensurate with its peers. An upgrade to 'A-' is not anticipated in the intermediate term. Upward ratings migration could result from a demonstration of and commitment to operating with debt leverage below 1.4x, combined with responsible M&A; activity that supports a sustained commitment to Cardinal's core drug distribution business. LIQUIDITY Cardinal has adequate liquidity with cash balances of $1.9 billion ($552 million held offshore) at Dec. 31, 2016 and near full availability under its $1.75 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) due 2019, plus an undrawn $700 million accounts receivable securitization program. The RCF also backs the $1.75 billion commercial paper program. Cardinal also had $201 million of available-for-sale marketable securities at Dec. 31, 2016 of which Fitch considers approximately $64 million to be available as a source of liquidity after discounting for the types of holdings. Fitch expects Cardinal will supplement this position and fund the transaction by issuing senior unsecured notes before the closing. Fitch expects this plan will be backstopped by a bridge facility. Fitch projects cash flows will remain robust, with annual FFO forecasted to approach $3 billion in the forecast period ($2.4 billion in fiscal 2017). Cash generation is sufficient to fund the firm's dividend and capex requirements. Debt maturities are manageable and well-laddered with approximately $500 million of debt maturing per year through FY2022. The ratings generally assume Cardinal will refinance debt maturities with like amounts though it will likely repay debt maturities over the next few years to reduce leverage. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the ratings as follows: Cardinal Health, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured bank facility at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'; --Commercial Paper at 'F2'. Allegience Corp. --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable.

Healthcare deal-making among high-quality companies has stalled, with President Trump and the Republican Congress tackling and then unable late last quarter to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Highly anticipated tax reforms are being delayed by the ongoing healthcare policy debate. President Trump has vowed to cut corporate taxes, as well as allow companies to bring cash stockpiles held overseas back to the US at sharply reduced tax rates, which could also stoke merger and acquisition activity. Investment grade healthcare companies borrowed just US$10bn in the loan market in the first quarter, 57% less than a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. Loans to high-quality companies accounted for 60% of the US$178bn in healthcare lending last year. But in the first quarter, the share sank to just 28% of the US$35.5bn volume. “For healthcare M&A;, transformative deals may be more limited in 2017 due to uncertainty related to Obamacare ‘Repeal and Replace’ as well as pending tax reform,” said Allen Fisher, a managing director and global head of healthcare banking at MUFG. “Comprehensive tax reform seems almost as unlikely as healthcare reform.” The deal logjam budged on Tuesday when Cardinal said it would buy Medtronic for US$6.1bn and agreed to a US$4.5bn bridge loan before locking in longer-term debt. Earlier in April, diversified healthcare company Abbott said it would buy Alere at a lower price than initially offered in February 2016, with both companies agreeing to drop lawsuits that prolonged the transaction. Last year, Abbot raised a US$9bn bridge for the Alere deal, and has yet to detail further financing needs.  These tie-ups come on the heels of several high-profile health insurer mergers - Aetna with Humana and Cigna with Anthem - scrapped by separate anti-trust rulings earlier this year. While healthcare mashups are being subdued, domestic M&A; broadly is being curbed by the considerable uncertainty surrounding tax and trade policy. Some mergers will push forward, based on an urgency for a takeover target, bankers said. “On the one hand you have PPG trying to go hostile into the Netherlands - which under the best of circumstances is difficult - as an example of an issuer willing to power through for an asset it wants to buy,” said a senior banker who expects ongoing strategic consolidation. On Wednesday, Pennsylvania-based PPG Industries dismissed efforts by Dutch paintmaker Akzo Nobel to fend off its takeover bid and won support from an activist hedge fund investor, Reuters reported. “On the other hand, there may be other Fortune 500 companies that are very much prepared to wait it out and see what the exchange rate environment, regulatory environment and general financing environment are before deciding if it’s still worthwhile,” said the banker. Amid the unknowns, investors in the healthcare arena are scrutinizing their picks sector by sector. “We’re trying to assess company performance to see whether there are going to be any liquidity issues, any collection issues, bad debt issues, things that would be indicative of the way payments and coverage may be affected,” said Farboud Tavangar, a founder of LCM Asset Management. Public and political scrutiny of high-priced medications could pressure pharmaceutical corporations, for example. Hospital companies, on the other hand, could benefit from an aging population and growing medical needs, most investors and strategists agree. “The essential service component of hospitals has always been a good protector against unreasonable actions in the past,” said Tavangar. “[However] we’re a little worried about diagnostics and reimbursements for diagnostics, screening and imaging companies, particularly if insurance companies approve fewer medical tests.”  Healthcare loan volume overall could end the year little changed from last year’s total, bankers said, even with current market trepidation.  First-quarter lending was off just 6% from a year earlier, as a surge of refinancing by lower-rated companies to cut borrowing costs tempered the slump in investment grade deals. Refinancing may continue to overshadow borrowing for new transactions.  A tax holiday that brings corporate cash to the US from overseas would “incentivize pharma and med-tech companies to go out and buy assets but not necessarily to make big-bet transformative acquisitions,” Fisher said. “Because the companies would use cash, it won’t necessarily produce a lot more financing activity.” ",4202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-lending/lpc-u-s-healthcare-lending-rouses-from-policy-induced-sedation-idUSKBN17M2E0

415,MDT,Medtronic's focus on surgical products fuels profit beat,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Plc (MDT.N)’s fourth-quarter profit topped analysts’ estimates as the world’s largest standalone medical device maker saw increased demand across almost all of its businesses, including its minimally invasive therapies. Medtronic, which gets most of its sales from heart devices, spinal implants and insulin pumps, has been making deals to push into the minimally invasive surgical products market in the past few years. The minimally invasive therapies unit, which Medtronic acquired as part of its $42.9 billion Covidien deal, generated sales of $2.61 billion in the quarter ended April 28, a 6 percent rise from a year earlier. Medical technology companies, such as Boston Scientific (BSX.N) and Baxter (BAX.N), have had a strong start to the year and investors have been encouraged by their solid growth prospects, as intense scrutiny over drug prices makes owning pharma and biotech stocks risky. The industry represents a way to bet on increasing medical procedures as the population ages, while potentially avoiding political risks. Leerink Partners analysts note that if Medtronic can continue to successfully execute on a steady stream of new product launches, the company should eventually be increasingly well-positioned to drive growth acceleration. Sales in Medtronic’s cardiac and vascular unit, where the company sells defibrillators, pacemakers, heart valves and stents, rose 5 percent on a constant currency basis to $2.85 billion, accounting for 36 percent of total sales. Net income attributable to Medtronic rose 5.3 percent to $1.16 billion, or 84 cents per share, in the quarter.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.33 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While some were nervous whether Medtronic would meet expectations given the utilization strength in first quarter for peers, we thought these numbers came in above expectations, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said in a client note. Net sales rose 4.6 percent to $7.92 billion, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $7.86 billion. The Dublin-based company said on Thursday it expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings to grow 9 percent-10 percent and revenue growth of 4 percent-5 percent on a constant currency basis. “We are optimistic that investors will digest the Fiscal 2018 guidance and see conservatism baked into the forecast after Fiscal 2017, where the guidance ranges proved to be aggressive, Cowen & Co analysts said in a client note.

420,MDT,Medtronic deal with Aetna ties insulin pump payment to patient results,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Plc said on Monday it signed an agreement with health insurer Aetna Inc under which payment for its insulin pump systems will be tied to how well diabetes patients fare after switching from multiple daily insulin injections. The deal is the latest example of the move toward contracts for prescription drugs and medical devices that attempt to bring down soaring healthcare costs by tying reimbursements to whether the products achieve their intended results. The deal with Aetna will measure health outcomes for patients who transition to one of three Medtronic pumps that self-adjust to keep blood sugar levels in proper range based on patients’ individual needs for insulin. “This agreement reinforces our shift towards value-based healthcare,” Hooman Hakami, president of the Medtronic diabetes group, said in a statement. “We know technology alone isn’t enough and ultimately improved outcomes are what matter.” Patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 who have progressed to the need for insulin typically check blood sugar levels several times a day and inject insulin as needed. The pumps eliminate that chore. Medtronic declined to discuss financial details of the Aetna agreement, but said such deals tie revenue to achievement of clinical improvement targets, as well as shared savings for delivering on or exceeding clinical outcomes and cost targets. Suzanne Winter, vice president of the Medtronic diabetes group in the Americas, said the Aetna agreement will initially focus on whether patients on its pumps achieve their A1c targets, a commonly used measure of blood sugar levels. The American Diabetes Association recommends A1c levels below 7. In the future it may look at other measures, such as hypoglycemia episodes, time in proper glycemic range, and patient satisfaction, Winter said. Medtronic already has an agreement with UnitedHealth Group Inc that is moving toward including patient outcomes and other metrics, such as total cost of care, and the company is discussing similar deals with other insurers, Winter said. Pharmaceutical companies are also beginning to embrace reimbursement options that take patient outcomes into consideration. U.S. biotech Amgen Inc, in an effort to improve patient access to its expensive new cholesterol drug Repatha, has offered contract options that include refunding the cost of the drug if patients suffer a heart attack or stroke while on the medicine intended to prevent them.",6262017,http://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-aetna-diabetes/medtronic-deal-with-aetna-ties-insulin-pump-payment-to-patient-results-idUSL1N1JN1NI

443,MDT,UPDATE 1-Medtronic to recall some diabetes infusion sets,"(Adds details) Sept 11 (Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Plc said on Monday it would recall certain infusion sets used with its insulin pumps by diabetes patients due to a component that could cause death in extreme cases. Infusion sets help connect an insulin pump device to the body. Medtronic said the vent membrane in some of its infusion sets could be blocked by fluid during the process of priming, or removal of air bubbles, potentially leading to insulin being over-delivered. Over-delivery of insulin can cause hypoglycemia or low blood sugar and in extreme cases, death. Medtronic said it had discontinued the affected vent membranes in the infusion sets. The Dublin-based company received reports of hypoglycemia requiring medical intervention, potentially linked to the issue, Medtronic said. Medtronic did not provide the number of infusion sets being recalled. The company in April recalled devices used to manage build-up of the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain due to increased complaints.

460,MDT,US STOCKS-Tech stocks boost Nasdaq to record,"* Oil prices steady ahead of OPEC meeting * Dollar Tree, Urban Outfitters rise after earnings * Medtronic gains on upbeat results * Indexes up: Dow 0.57 pct, S&P; 0.48 pct, Nasdaq 0.59 pct (Updates to open) By Sruthi Shankar Nov 21 (Reuters) - Technology stocks boosted the Nasdaq Composite index to a record at the open on Tuesday, while encouraging results from some retailers and Medtronic helped bolster the gains. As the third-quarter earnings season winds down and with no major economic data scheduled for the week, trading volumes were thin and expected to get even quieter in the run-up to the Thanksgiving holiday. Also helping the market was a slight rise in oil prices ahead of next week’s OPEC meeting at which major crude exporters are expected to extend production cuts. A dip in the dollar index, after a strong gain on Monday, also eased the pressure on commodities. A lower dollar helps U.S. multinationals increase the value of overseas income. “With the momentum being to the upside, it’s very easy to keep pushing the market higher,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “As we get closer to the end of the year, there is a push toward ending the year on a high note.” At 9:41 a.m. ET (1341 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 132.58 points, or 0.57 percent, at 23,562.91, the S&P; 500 was up 12.36 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,594.5 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 40.23 points, or 0.59 percent, at 6,830.95. All the 11 major S&P; indexes were higher, led by gains in technology index, which is the best performing sector this year. Apple’s shares were up 1.1 percent, boosting all three major indexes. Medtronic rose 5 percent, making it the top gainer on the S&P; 500, after the medical device maker reported better-than-expected results and backed its forecast. Hormel Foods rose 5.4 percent, while Urban Outfitters gained 1.5 percent after issuing their quarterly reports. Lowe’s dipped marginally despite the No. 2 U.S. home improvement chain reporting strong sales and profit on higher demand after the recent hurricanes. Other decliners included Signet Jewelers, which tanked 27 percent after reporting weak same-store sales and a surprise quarterly loss. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,959 to 608. On the Nasdaq, 1,654 issues rose and 761 fell.

462,MDT,Medtronic settles states' probe into Infuse marketing for $12 million,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Medtronic Plc has agreed to pay $12 million to resolve claims that the company engaged in a deceptive marketing strategy to promote its Infuse bone graft product used in spinal surgery, the Massachusetts attorney general said on Wednesday. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said the settlement will resolve an investigation by her office and those in four other states related to Medtronic’s promotion of Infuse, which is used to stimulate bone growth. In court papers, Healey alleged that Medtronic sought to expand the device’s market by using deceptive company-sponsored scientific literature to make false and misleading claims about its safety and superiority. According to the lawsuit, Medtronic collaborated with doctors who were paid millions of dollars in consulting fees to publish studies that the company then disseminated downplaying side-effects and omitting discussion of adverse results. “Companies cannot use deceptive practices to increase their profits, while compromising the safety and well-being of patients,” Healey said in a statement. Medtronic in a statement said nothing in the deal could be taken as a concession that it violated the law. It did not admit wrongdoing, according to court papers. Infuse, which includes a manufactured version of a human bone-growth protein, was developed by as an alternative to bone grafts. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it for use in some lower back spinal surgeries in 2002. But off-label uses of Infuse eventually comprised 85 percent of sales. The FDA in 2008 warned against such uses, following reports of life-threatening complications. In October 2012, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee found that Medtronic was “heavily involved” in shaping the content of published studies on Infuse and paid doctors who authored them $210 million. Under Wednesday’s settlement, two Medtronic units will pay $12 million to resolve an investigation by attorneys general in Massachusetts, Oregon, California, Illinois and Washington. The accord also imposes requirements on how Medtronic promoted clinical trial information and disseminated medical journal articles related to Infuse. The company must also make Infuse trial data public on a government website. Medtronic has also faced more than 6,000 lawsuits nationally by people who claimed they suffered injuries after it promoted Infuse for off-label uses. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Dec. 4, Medtronic said it had reached agreements to settle “substantially all of these claims” as of July this year. It did not provide additional information. ",12132017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-medtronic-settlement-infuse/medtronic-settles-states-probe-into-infuse-marketing-for-12-million-idUSKBN1E72KA

469,MDT,"UPDATE 2-China cracks down on foreign companies calling Taiwan, other regions countries","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s aviation authority on Friday demanded an apology from Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) for listing Taiwan and Tibet as countries on its website, while another government agency took aim at Inditex-owned (ITX.MC) fashion brand Zara and medical device maker Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) for similar issues. The moves follow a regulator’s decision on Thursday to suspend Marriott International Inc’s (MAR.O) Chinese website for a week to punish the world’s biggest hotel chain for listing Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries in a customer questionnaire. The apparent intensification of efforts to police how foreign businesses refer to Chinese-claimed territories - even if only in pull-down menus - underscores just how sensitive the issue of sovereignty has become in a China that is increasingly emboldened on the international stage. The involvment of more than one Chinese authority in rebuking businesses across different industries suggested possible coordination at a high level of government. “It’s hard not to see it as part of the wider trend where nationalist issues are being emphasized very deliberately as part of the new era,” said a China-based Western businessman who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the topic. “It’s hard not to think that this is the shape of things to come for foreign companies, having to be even more careful about these sensitivities.” Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously. China annexed Tibet in 1950, although Beijing has long claimed the Himalayan region has been an indivisible part of China throughout history. Taiwan is China’s most sensitive territorial issue. The ruling Communist Party considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province and refuses to renounce the threat of force to bring it into the fold. On Friday, the Civil Aviation Administration of China asked Delta to investigate the listing of Taiwan and Tibet as countries on its website, and called for an “immediate and public” apology. The aviation authority also said it would require all foreign airlines operating routes to China to conduct comprehensive investigations of their websites, apps and customer-related information and “strictly comply with China’s laws and regulations to prevent a similar thing from happening”. In a statement, Delta apologized for making “an inadvertent error with no business or political intention”, saying it recognized the seriousness of the issue and had taken steps to resolve it. Separately, the same regulator that penalized Marriott - the Shanghai branch of the state cyberspace administration - accused Zara of placing Taiwan in a pull-down list of countries on its Chinese website. Medtronic had also put “Republic of China (Taiwan)” on one of its websites, the office said in a WeChat post, giving both companies until 6 pm local time to apologize. Medtronic issued an apology via social media, saying it had updated the website. An executive who answered the phone at Zara’s Shanghai office was not able to immediately comment. China has long-running territorial disputes with several neighbors and has never been shy about correcting what it sees as misrepresentations of Chinese territory. Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular briefing on Friday that Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Tibet were all part of China. “The companies that come to China should respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, abide by China’s laws, and respect the feelings of the Chinese people. This is the minimum requirement of any company going to another country to carry out business and investment,” he said.  Last year, German carmaker Audi AG apologized for using a map that excluded Taiwan and parts of Tibet and the western Xinjiang region after it was heavily crticized on Chinese social media.

475,MDT,"Medtronic quarterly revenue beats, margins disappoint","(Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Plc’s quarterly revenue beat analysts’ expectations as new product launches drove sales across its business units, but weaker-than-expected margins clouded the earnings report. Sales in its biggest business, the cardiac and vascular unit that sells defibrillators, pace-makers, heart valves and stents, jumped 10 percent to $2.8 billion, partly helped by a successful launch of its Evolut Pro transcatheter heart valve. The increasingly competitive market for transcatherter valves, used to replace diseased aortic valves without open-heart surgery, is expected to expand from $3 billion currently to $5 billion in 2021 as more types of patients get treated with the valves. “Our revenue performance is highly dependent on new product launch process and when we’ve got new products, the revenue growth goes up quite significantly especially with respect to the market,” said Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak. Analysts called the revenue beat well-rounded as all four of the company’s business units topped expectations, but some questioned weakness in margins. “Operating margin came in at 27.9 percent as reported, deteriorated by about 30 bps y/y. But this falls below us by about 30bps and the Street by about 100bps, potentially disappointing folks,” Leerink Analyst Danielle Antalffy said. The company’s shares were marginally down in early trading. Sales in the company’s diabetes unit rose 17 percent to $584 million, as its new 670G system, which mimics some of the functions of a healthy pancreas, completed a priority access program.

493,MDT,"Edward Lifesciences' heart valve sales in Europe disappoint, shares fall","(Reuters) - Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s (EW.N) first-quarter sales for transcatheter heart valves missed Wall Street targets on Tuesday, as the medical device maker lost market share in Europe to its rival, Medtronic Plc (MDT.N).    The company’s shares fell as much as 8.1 percent in after-market trading as sales of its premium non-invasive device, used to replace diseased aortic valves without open-heart surgery, is its biggest growth driver.  “Procedure growth in Europe was double digits this quarter, while our growth was lower due to a year-over-year shift in share to our largest competitor,” Chief Executive Officer Michael A. Mussallem said on a call with analysts. The increasingly competitive market for transcatheter valves is expected to expand from $3 billion currently to $5 billion in 2021 as more types of patients get treated with the valves. The company’s closest rival is Medtronic and analysts expect the entry of Boston Scientific’s (BSX.N) valve into the market by late 2018 to further heat up the competition.  Edwards Lifesciences said its global sales of the heart valves rose 2.3 percent to $551.5 million in the quarter. However, analysts were expecting a sales of $579.64 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s net profit fell to $206.6 million, or 96 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a $230.2 million, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.22 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.11 per share. Net sales rose 1.3 percent to $894.8 million in the quarter. However, the company’s forecast for current quarter adjusted profit of $1.05 to $1.15 per share missed estimates. Analysts were expecting a profit  of $1.17 per share.  The company raised its full-year earnings per share forecast range to $4.50-$4.70 from $4.43-$4.63. Shares of the company were trading lower at $123.58 after the bell.
