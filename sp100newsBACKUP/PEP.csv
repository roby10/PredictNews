7,PEP,PepsiCo cuts ties with palm oil supplier over labor abuse claims,"KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Food and beverage giant PepsiCo has suspended procurement from a palm oil supplier over claims of labor abuses on its Indonesian plantations, a move hailed by campaigners on Wednesday. A 2016 probe by several campaign groups alleged there were child labor and worker exploitations, such as low wages and hazardous working conditions, on Indonesian plantations operated by Singapore-listed Indofood Agri Resources (IndoAgri). Although IndoAgri has taken action to address the complaints, PepsiCo said it decided to suspend ties “pending further progress and visibility around the issues” after it looked into the allegations. “PepsiCo is very concerned about the allegations that our policies and commitments on palm oil, forestry stewardship and human rights are not being met,” it said in a statement. Neither IndoAgri nor its parent company, Indofood, were immediately available to comment. IndoAgri said on its website that it has a sustainable palm oil policy which ensures human rights are respected.    Businesses are facing increasing pressure from governments and consumers to disclose what actions they are taking to ensure their supply chains are free from modern-day slavery. Indonesia is the world’s largest palm oil producer but it has been regularly linked to the destruction of rainforests and wildlife habitats, as well as displacement of indigenous communities. IndoAgri is a subsidiary of Indonesian food manufacturer Indofood, which produces PepsiCo’s snacks in Indonesia under a joint venture partnership. The joint venture sourced palm oil from IndoAgri.  The investigation was carried out by San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Indonesian labor rights group OPPUK and Washington-based International Labor Rights Forum. “After years of denial, PepsiCo has admitted to the high risks associated with its palm oil supply chain and business partner,” RAN campaigner Robin Averbeck said in a statement.

10,PEP,"UPDATE 5-Coffee meets 7UP in Keurig, Dr Pepper Snapple deal","(Reuters) - Keurig Green Mountain has struck a deal worth more than $21 billion to combine with soda maker Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc DPS.N to form a North American drinks company with brands like Green Mountain Coffee, 7UP, Snapple and Sunkist. The latest in a five-year string of acquisitions by Keurig’s owner, Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Co, it creates an enlarged group with a wide range of hot and cold beverages, different ways to access customers and a bigger platform for further deals. “We have a really wide portfolio of brands, we’re able to address almost every consumer need in every format and ... to reach every point of sale,” Keurig Chief Executive Bob Gamgort told Reuters.   “If you want to win in the beverage industry you need a portion of your portfolio that gives you significant scale and then you need to be able to layer in higher growth segments,” he said.  Keurig will pay a special dividend of $103.75 per share to Dr Pepper Snapple shareholders, resulting in a cash payment of $18.7 billion. Those shareholders will also retain a 13 percent stake in the combined company to be called ‘Keurig Dr Pepper’. A 13 percent stake in Dr Pepper Snapple was worth more than $2.2 billion before the deal was announced. The company’s shares jumped 25 percent on Monday to $119.70 in New York.     Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj estimates the deal’s value at $26 billion to $27 billion. “From DPS’ perspective at this time it makes a lot of sense,” said Josh Blechman, director of capital markets at Exponential ETFs, which owns shares of Dr Pepper Snapple. “They needed to diversify their business line from sugary drinks, so I think that this is a really good deal.” The companies expect $600 million in cost-savings, and see opportunities to expand the business such as by selling coffee in bottles and in vending machines. Dr Pepper’s direct-to-store delivery model will be complemented by Keurig’s online presence and relationships with major supermarket chains. Bulking up is a way to boost efficiency in the business at a time when soft drink sales are falling as consumers cut down on sugar. “If your truck is becoming less full because volumes are declining, you should have other beverages to fill that spot,” said Bernstein’s Dibadj, who has predicted beer and soft drink tie-ups for the same reason. “The likelihood that Coke (KO.N) and Pepsi (PEP.O) will get bought has just gone up,” Dibadj said. That would mean a mega-deal, given those soft-drink giants have market values of more than $200 billion and $170 billion respectively. Keurig Green Mountain is the leading single-serve coffee company in the United States. It was taken over by JAB, the holding company of the German billionaire Reimann family, in 2016 for $13.9 billion.   JAB has been on an acquisition spree in recent years, with a string of restaurant deals including Au Bon Pain, Krispy Kreme and Panera Bread as well as several coffee businesses from niche brand Intelligentsia to controlling the international coffee operations of Mondelez International (MDLZ.O).  JAB and its partners will make an equity investment of $9 billion in the deal. Mondelez, now a major Keurig shareholder, will own about 13 percent to 14 percent of the combined company. Jefferies analysts said further deals by Keurig Dr Pepper are very likely, as the company pays down a debt load expected to be about $16.6 billion when the deal closes, scheduled for the second quarter.  The company expects to get its leverage to below three times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization within two to three years, while paying an annual dividend of 60 cents per share. Goldman Sachs was the lead financial adviser to Keurig and Credit Suisse advised Dr Pepper Snapple on the deal.

14,PEP,PepsiCo tops sales estimates as strong snack brands provide boost,"(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc’s (PEP.O) sales topped Wall Street forecasts in the fourth quarter, as higher demand at its snacks business that makes Doritos and Cheetos made up for a decline in sales of sugary drinks. As consumers increasingly ditch sodas and sugary drinks, Purchase, New York-based Pepsi has sharpened its focus on snacks as well as healthier beverages. Indeed, Pepsi rival Dr Pepper Snapple DPS.N agreed to merge with Keurig Green Mountain last month in a $21 billion deal as a way to lower its reliance on soft drinks. However, asked to comment on the deal by an analyst on Tuesday’s earnings call, PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said: “I’m sure there is some towering strategic logic, but we are still searching for it.” In the quarter ended Dec. 31, organic sales at Pepsi’s Frito-Lay snacks division rose 5 percent, buoyed by demand for salty snacks and as prices rose 2 percent. Organic sales exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. The snacks business contributes about 25 percent of overall revenue. Organic sales at PepsiCo’s North American beverages business that sells Gatorade and Mountain Dew dipped 3 percent. Total revenue rose slightly to $19.53 billion, topping analysts’ average estimate of $19.39 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. PepsiCo recorded a loss of $710 million, reflecting a $2.5 billion one-time charge related to new U.S. tax laws, compared to a year-earlier profit of $1.40 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.31 per share, edging past analysts’ estimates of $1.30. “We are broadly impressed with Pepsi’s ability to deliver bottom-line results despite the dynamic retail environment and their continued underperformance in the beverages,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said. For 2018, the company expects earnings of $5.70 per share, slightly above analysts’ estimates of $5.67. PepsiCo forecast organic revenue to be largely unchanged compared with 2017.

20,PEP,RPT-FOCUS-Sime Darby's Africa ambitions stall pending new deforestation rules,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * Sime has planted 10k ha at its 200k Liberia concession * Uncertainty over new RSPO rules main reason for stall * New rules expected by November on planting in forested areas * Africa disappoints as new frontier for palm oil By Edward McAllister and Emily Chow GBAH, Liberia/KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 14 (Reuters) - When Malaysia’s biggest plantation company Sime Darby leased 220,000 hectares of lush forest in northwest Liberia in 2009, executives said they had found a much needed new frontier in global palm oil development. Undulating hills, a tropical climate and plenty of untouched land made the West African country’s interior ideal for palm oil growers running out of room in Southeast Asia. Nine years later, however, Sime Darby Plantation has planted only 10,000 hectares in Liberia and has not laid a seed in two years, stalled by uncertainties over new environmental standards. “We are losing money. We have to balance our books or there is no future,” said David Parker, the head of Sime Darby Plantations in Liberia. In its earnings report for the financial year ending in June 2017, Sime Darby said it had filed a 202 million ringgit ($51.3 million) impairment - a permanent reduction in the value of the asset - on its Liberia operations. The operations were “affected by a number of factors, including the Ebola outbreak and more stringent environmental plans that have stalled expansion since 2014”, it said. The $62 billion palm oil industry is considering whether to adopt new “no deforestation” rules for an oil found on supermarket shelves across the world, from cooking oil to snack food and soups to soaps. The rules mark a more environmentally friendly form of palm oil development, but leave producers with a major conundrum: how to meet growing demand and make money with so much land now potentially off limits. The debate is unfolding at the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an industry watchdog that consists of planters, companies and NGOs. While awaiting those rules, Sime Darby has stopped planting palm in Liberia, Parker said. Singapore-listed Olam International in Gabon has also paused development on all but grassland areas until the rules are published, said Ranveer Chauhan, its managing director of edible oils. But back at corporate headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Sime says it is trying out a new method using satellite data to measure a forest’s carbon content so it can tell exactly how much land it can and cannot develop. “A new plan for land development in Liberia is currently being prepared following the completion of these trials,” Sime’s chief sustainability officer Simon Lord told Reuters. Darrel Webber, chief executive officer at the RSPO secretariat in Malaysia, said he cannot comment with the review under way “and no conclusive decisions on the changes have been made yet”. The rules are expected to come to a vote at RSPO’s annual meeting in November. Concerns about the amount of forests and peatlands cleared for plantations - and the greenhouse gases that are then emitted into the atmosphere - have plagued the palm oil industry for years. Over the past decade, consumer activist groups have pressed big palm oil buyers such as Pepsico, Unilever and Nestle with supermarket boycotts and other protests over palm oil’s perceived links to climate change. Many companies are willing to pay a premium price for palm oil labelled with a valued RSPO sustainability certificate. The new rules will decide if land can be cleared for palm based on its carbon content. A dense forest might hold up to 150 tonnes of carbon per hectare, grassland about 35 tonnes. If the RSPO decides an area holding above 100 tonnes an hectare is off limits, then Sime Darby may be unable to develop most of its Liberia concession, said Ahmad Rifqi, Sime Darby’s manager of plantation sustainability in Liberia. “Almost all here is over 100 tonnes per hectare. The only low-carbon areas are farmlands already cultivated by local communities,” he said. Sime Darby boasts of being the world’s biggest producer of sustainable palm oil. It has an online “dashboard” displaying information about its supply chain and compliance with RSPO rules. It’s land bank of nearly 990,000 hectares, an area larger than Puerto Rico, makes it the world’s largest palm plantation firm by land size. The Liberia concessions account for over a fifth of that. With governments and companies under increasing pressure to adhere to higher deforestation standards, “greenfield” expansions in Southeast Asia have become uncommon, says Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CIMB Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur. “In recent years, company expansion is largely via buying stakes of other companies,” Ng said. Sime Darby’s only major expansion in Southeast Asia since its 2007 merger with two other large plantation firms has been its acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil in Papua New Guinea in 2015. Oil palm originated in West Africa and was used there for thousands of years. And with global demand growing by an average 5 percent a year, growers had looked to Africa to expand. Yet production in Africa has grown by less than 4 percent since 2012, compared to around 18.5 percent for Southeast Asia and globally. Latin America is now the number two producing region. From a watchtower on Sime Darby’s Liberian plantation, low lines of palm can be seen trailing to the horizon, a duller green than the natural forest canopy that towers above the concession’s edge. The serene view belies a cascade of troubles. Local residents, who claimed Sime had encroached on community ands, set up roadblocks to halt workers and stole keys from bulldozers, community leaders and workers told Reuters. Sime says the land came from a government concession. But to appease residents, it built schools and offers free medical services to workers and their families. Its own ambitions, meanwhile, have shrunk. A new mill that doesn’t have enough fruit to press into oil to run at full capacity and crop theft by local residents costs the company about 20 percent of its harvest in some areas, Parker said. Sime hopes to plant another 10,000 hectares once it can show the first 10,000 are profitable, Parker said. “Sime Darby is committed to the long term - if we can make a profit on the first 10,000 hectares.” ",02142018,http://www.reuters.com/article/palmoil-sime-darby-africa/rpt-focus-sime-darbys-africa-ambitions-stall-pending-new-deforestation-rules-idUSL4N1Q441I

We have to balance our books or there is no future,” said David Parker, the head of Sime Darby Plantations in Liberia. In its earnings report for the financial year ending in June 2017, Sime Darby said it had filed a 202 million ringgit ($51.3 million) impairment - a permanent reduction in the value of the asset - on its Liberia operations. The operations were “affected by a number of factors, including the Ebola outbreak and more stringent environmental plans that have stalled expansion since 2014”, it said.       The $62 billion palm oil industry is considering whether to adopt new “no deforestation” rules for an oil found on supermarket shelves across the world, from cooking oil to snack food and soups to soaps.  The rules mark a more environmentally friendly form of palm oil development, but leave producers with a major conundrum: how to meet growing demand and make money with so much land now potentially off limits. The debate is unfolding at the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an industry watchdog that consists of planters, companies and NGOs.  While awaiting those rules, Sime Darby has stopped planting palm in Liberia, Parker said. Singapore-listed Olam International in Gabon has also paused development on all but grassland areas until the rules are published, said Ranveer Chauhan, its managing director of edible oils.  But back at corporate headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Sime says it is trying out a new method using satellite data to measure a forest’s carbon content so it can tell exactly how much land it can and cannot develop.  “A new plan for land development in Liberia is currently being prepared following the completion of these trials,” Sime’s chief sustainability officer Simon Lord told Reuters. Darrel Webber, chief executive officer at the RSPO secretariat in Malaysia, said he cannot comment with the review under way “and no conclusive decisions on the changes have been made yet”.  The rules are expected to come to a vote at RSPO’s annual meeting in November. Concerns about the amount of forests and peatlands cleared for plantations - and the greenhouse gases that are then emitted into the atmosphere - have plagued the palm oil industry for years.      Over the past decade, consumer activist groups have pressed big palm oil buyers such as Pepsico, Unilever and Nestle with supermarket boycotts and other protests over palm oil’s perceived links to climate change. Many companies are willing to pay a premium price for palm oil labelled with a valued RSPO sustainability certificate. The new rules will decide if land can be cleared for palm based on its carbon content. A dense forest might hold up to 150 tonnes of carbon per hectare, grassland about 35 tonnes.  If the RSPO decides an area holding above 100 tonnes an hectare is off limits, then Sime Darby may be unable to develop most of its Liberia concession, said Ahmad Rifqi, Sime Darby’s  manager of plantation sustainability in Liberia. “Almost all here is over 100 tonnes per hectare. The only low-carbon areas are farmlands already cultivated by local communities,” he said.  Sime Darby boasts of being the world’s biggest producer of sustainable palm oil. It has an online “dashboard” displaying information about its supply chain and compliance with RSPO rules.  It’s land bank of nearly 990,000 hectares, an area larger than Puerto Rico, makes it the world’s largest palm plantation firm by land size. The Liberia concessions account for over a fifth of that. With governments and companies under increasing pressure to adhere to higher deforestation standards, “greenfield” expansions in Southeast Asia have become uncommon, says Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CIMB Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur.	         “In recent years, company expansion is largely via buying stakes of other companies,” Ng said. Sime Darby’s only major expansion in Southeast Asia since its 2007 merger with two other large plantation firms has been its acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil in Papua New Guinea in 2015.      Oil palm originated in West Africa and was used there for thousands of years. And with global demand growing by an average 5 percent a year, growers had looked to Africa to expand.     Yet production in Africa has grown by less than 4 percent since 2012, compared to around 18.5 percent for Southeast Asia and globally. Latin America is now the number two producing region. From a watchtower on Sime Darby’s Liberian plantation, low lines of palm can be seen trailing to the horizon, a duller green than the natural forest canopy that towers above the concession’s edge.  The serene view belies a cascade of troubles. Local residents, who claimed Sime had encroached on community ands, set up roadblocks to halt workers and stole keys from bulldozers, community leaders and workers told Reuters. Sime says the land came from a government concession. But to appease residents, it built schools and offers free medical services to workers and their families.     Its own ambitions, meanwhile, have shrunk.  A new mill that doesn’t have enough fruit to press into oil to run at full capacity and crop theft by local residents costs the company about 20 percent of its harvest in some areas, Parker said.  Sime hopes to plant another 10,000 hectares once it can show the first 10,000 are profitable, Parker said. “Sime Darby is committed to the long term - if we can make a profit on the first 10,000 hectares.”  ",02142018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-palmoil-sime-darby-africa/sime-darbys-africa-ambitions-stall-pending-new-deforestation-rules-idUSKCN1FY054
22,PEP,FOCUS-Sime Darby's Africa ambitions stall pending new deforestation rules,"GBAH, Liberia/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - When Malaysia’s biggest plantation company Sime Darby leased 220,000 hectares of lush forest in northwest Liberia in 2009, executives said they had found a much needed new frontier in global palm oil development.

27,PEP,"Pepsi tops estimates, promises more investments in North America","(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on Thursday as double-digit growth in developing markets offset another quarter of weak results in its North American beverage unit.   Like rival Coca-Cola (KO.N), the world’s second-biggest beverage maker is introducing new drinks to claw back ground in a U.S. market where sugary soda makers have suffered from consumers shifting toward healthier beverages, but its efforts are only slowly bearing fruit.  Sales in PepsiCo’s North America beverage unit, which accounts for nearly a third of total revenue and sells Lipton tea, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi itself, fell by less than in previous quarters but were still down 1 percent. Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said on a post-earnings call PepsiCo was determined to reverse three quarters of decline and would step up spending on its marquee soda brand under a new “Pepsi Generations” campaign.  Nooyi said despite a moderate increase in media spending on trademark Pepsi over the past three years, the company’s market share has fallen dramatically relative to its key competitor. “We’ll go toe-to-toe and increase our spending in colas, in particular, but we’re going to remain very responsible on pricing,” Nooyi said. Earlier this week, Coke’s beverage sales blew past estimates, as it introduced four new flavors of Diet Coke and saw demand for Coke Zero sugar increase. PepsiCo’s new marketing efforts could further pressure operating profits, which have already shown weakness in its North American Frito-Lay, Quaker Foods and Beverages businesses, due to higher input costs as well as bonuses paid to employees following President Donald Trump’s Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Shares of the Purchase, New York-based company were around 0.3 percent higher by midday, having risen as much as 1.4 percent.    In contrast to North America, first-quarter sales in Latin American markets rose 14 percent, while those in Europe and sub-Saharan Africa gained 15 percent. Sales in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa were up 7 percent. The company’s Frito-Lay snacking business in North America did better than beverages, rising 3.4 percent in the quarter, although it missed expectations of 4 percent growth. The Quaker business - which includes the eponymous porridge oats - showed flat sales in North America due to cuts in pricing. “All North American units miss (but) LatAm (was) surprisingly strong,” Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein said.    Excluding items, Pepsi earned 96 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
