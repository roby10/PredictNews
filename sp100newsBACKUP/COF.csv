1,COF,"Retail, tech lead Wall Street rally before jobs data","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks closed sharply higher and the Nasdaq notched an eighth day of gains on Thursday as improved labor market and retail sales data added to optimism a day before the critical June payrolls report.  Equities have been on a tear recently as improving economic data and a potential resolution to Greece’s fiscal issues paved over fears of slowing growth and contagion stemming from the euro zone’s debt crisis.  The Nasdaq’s 8.3 percent gain over the past eight trading sessions is the most for the index in two years and the S&P’s 6.7 percent rise is its best since September 2010, as the market reacted to news of the Fed’s second round of stimulus. The Dow is up 6.6 percent over the same period.  “It’s all about the data today, which was great, and is causing people to revise their outlooks up for tomorrow,” said Jeffrey Friedman, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “We passed through a resistance level of 1,352 on the S&P, and the next stop after that could be new highs for the year.”  All 10 S&P sectors rose, led by materials .GSPM, which gained 1.5 percent, while Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX.N) climbed 3.7 percent to $55.49.  Both the S&P retail index .RLX and the Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT hit all-time highs.  Data from payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private-sector employers added 157,000 jobs last month, more than double what was expected. The report, coupled with a fall in new claims for jobless benefits, raised hopes that a recent slowdown in the economy may only be temporary.  The report fueled speculation that Friday’s non-farm payrolls report from the Labor Department would provide more evidence of an improving labor market, a key factor if markets are to rally into the end of the year.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI shot up 93.47 points, or 0.74 percent, to 12,719.49. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 14 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,353.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 38.64 points, or 1.36 percent, to 2,872.66.  The market’s rally has some analysts calling for a near-term pullback.  “I can’t make a case from this rally that we’re home clear,” said James Meyer, chief investment officer of Tower Bridge Advisers in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. “We’ve gone from the bottom of the range to the top, and I suspect trading will be choppy around here.”  Retailers were among the best performers after several top companies reported better-than-expected sales gains for June, using bargains to lure shoppers in an uncertain economy.

5,COF,UPDATE 5-Capital One profit jumps 50 pct; raises $2 billion," * Q2 EPS $1.97 vs Street view $1.71   * Net charge-off rate 2.91 pct vs 5.35 pct year ago   * Loan loss provision $343 mln vs $723 mln year ago   * Shares off 1 pct to $51.71  (Adds stock offering; updates with closing share price)   By Joe Rauch   CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 13 (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) said on Wednesday its second-quarter profit jumped 50 percent as fewer customers defaulted on credit cards, a sign consumer loans might be a bright spot for other major banks.   Capital One also raised $2 billion through a stock offering on Wednesday, selling 40 million shares at $50.87 each. The bank had said the issue would fund its previously announced acquisition of ING Groep NV’s ING.AS U.S. online bank.   Over the next 10 days, most of the top U.S. banks are due to report quarterly results, starting with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) on Thursday. [ID:nN1E7600D5]   Capital One, a bank whose results are closely linked to credit cards, earned $911 million, or $1.97 per share, in the second quarter, up from $608 million, or $1.33 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $1.71 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   The bank’s profit gains were driven primarily by writing off fewer bad loans and releasing funds previously set aside to cover bad loans. But revenue growth was tepid.   The bank’s net charge-off rate — the percentage of defaulted loans being written off — fell to 2.91 percent from 5.36 percent a year earlier, while revenue rose just 2.3 percent to $3.99 billion. Net interest income edged up to $3.14 billion from $3.1 billion.   Capital One’s credit card charge-offs declined by nearly half, to 5.06 percent from 9.36 percent. The decline matched projections by industry analysts, who note most banks have weeded out their weakest credit card borrowers, nearly three years after the financial crisis peaked, and credit card defaults will continue to shrink.   In a May report, Moodys Corp (MCO.N) analysts projected industrywide credit card charge-offs will decline to a two-decade low of 4 percent by the end of 2012.   Banks are only now starting to ramp up credit card lending. That means that, even if defaults rise, they will not likely rise until next year, since there is often a lag between when a credit card account is opened and when default occurs.   Overall, the amount McLean, Virginia-based Capital One set aside to cover problem loans fell to $343 million in the second quarter from $723 million a year earlier.   Capital One said its $2 billion stock offering will be underwritten by Barclays Capital, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan.   The bank also entered into a forward sale agreement with Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley. The agreement sells shares at the current stock price, but shares will not change hands until seven months after the date of the stock offering.   Chip MacDonald, a banking attorney with Jones Day, said the deal will allow the bank to show regulators that Capital One has the capital to absorb ING’s operations, without additional shareholder dilution months before the acquisition is completed.   In June, the bank announced plans to buy ING’s U.S. online bank for $9 billion in cash and stock. [ID:nN16217142]   For Capital One, the deal is part of its push to further expand its banking operation. The company spent much of the past decade transforming from a specialty credit card lender that mainly funded itself in the bond market, into a bank that relies heavily on deposits.   Now, facing weakened loan demand after the financial crisis, the bank is again looking for deals to expand its business. This spring, Capital One bought $3.7 billion of credit card loans from JPMorgan Chase as part of a deal to issue credit cards on behalf of retailer Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N).   The bank may bid on HSBC’s U.S. credit card assets, sources have told Reuters. [ID:nN11174077]   For ING, the sale is part of a restructuring forced by a 10 billion euro bailout received during the 2008 financial crisis.   When completed, the deal will make Capital One the seventh-largest U.S. bank by assets.   ING will receive a 9.9 percent stake in Capital One as part of the deal and the right to appoint a board member.   Capital One shares closed down $1.37, or 2.6 percent, at $50.87 on the New York Stock Exchange.

9,COF,"JPMorgan profit rises, loan book grows","NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co posted a higher-than-expected second-quarter profit as it wrote off fewer bad mortgages and credit card loans.  The second-largest U.S. bank made new loans faster than customers paid off existing ones during the quarter, a reversal from the first quarter and a good sign for a business long plagued by weak loan demand.  JPMorgan’s revenue rose and it added staff in the quarter, and its shares closed 1.8 percent higher on Thursday. But the bank faces big expenses from mortgages as the effects of the housing crisis linger.  Foreclosures could take another 12 to 18 months to start declining, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call with reporters.  “JPMorgan’s revenue growth is a sign that things are getting better. They’re just not getting better quickly,” said Ralph Cole, portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon. Ferguson Wellman owns JPMorgan shares.  Revenue of $27 billion was up 7 percent from a year earlier.  Although loans at the end of the second quarter were up from the end of the first quarter, average loans outstanding declined, signaling that even if loan demand is improving, growth is uneven.  JPMorgan is the first major U.S. bank to post quarterly results. Its performance hints at how other banks fared.  Bond trading revenue fell 18 percent from the first quarter, but the decline was less than some investors feared. Shares of investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley rose on hopes that JPMorgan’s trading results bode well, but turned negative later in the day.  JPMorgan earned $5.43 billion, or $1.27 a share, in the second quarter, beating the average Wall Street estimate by 6 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The results were up from earnings of $4.8 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier.  The bank benefited from not having to pay a British tax on bonuses. That tax reduced profits by $550 million, or 14 cents a share, last year.  JPMorgan made more loans during the quarter, net of customer loan repayments. Its loan book grew to $689.74 billion at the end of the quarter from $686 billion at the end of March as increased business lending offset a 2 percent decline in consumer lending.  The bank also gathered more deposits during the quarter; deposits rose 5 percent from the first quarter to $1.05 trillion. Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein said mid-sized companies delivered much of the money.  Shrinking loan books and low interest rates since 2008 have made it difficult for banks to post profits, or increase them. A large part of earnings over the past year has come from setting aside less money to cover bad loans, or dipping into funds previously set aside.  Many analysts hope that banks will start to post loan growth in the coming quarters, which would be a sign of sustainable increases in profits.  Dimon, who is famously blunt, seemed optimistic about the outlook for profits. He said the bank will build capital levels in the coming months, and criticized regulators for not allowing it to return those funds to shareholders faster.  “God knows why we have to hold all that capital,” Dimon said, adding that banks’ capital ratios are going “to drive up so fast people are going to be surprised.”  JPMorgan reduced the expense it recorded for credit costs to $1.81 billion in the second quarter from $3.36 billion a year earlier. However, that was up from $1.17 billion in the 2011 first quarter.  After announcing earnings, the bank went to the corporate debt market and sold $1.75 billion of bonds due in 30 years, an unusually long term for bank debt, but JPMorgan’s second 30-year issue in nine months, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters capital markets service.  Mortgage costs were down slightly, but Dimon cautioned that the housing market was still working through difficulties.  “Unfortunately, it will take some time to resolve these issues and it is possible we will incur additional costs along the way,” he said.  JPMorgan expects to have to repurchase $3.6 billion of mortgages that it packaged into bonds. Such repurchases are usually because a bank failed to properly collect payments on the mortgages, or should never have sold them to investors.  JPMorgan said it added $1.3 billion to its litigation reserves, mainly for mortgage-related matters. It also continued to add to its loan reserves for losses on mortgages.  “It is possible we are very over-reserved in mortgage land,” Dimon said in a conference call with analysts.  He expects to win a legal battle with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp over liabilities left from busted lender Washington Mutual, pieces of which JPMorgan bought in a government-arranged deal during the financial crisis.  Credit card delinquencies are improving so quickly that the bank drew down its reserves for losses on those balances, adding 15 cents a share to second-quarter profit.  The charge-off rate for uncollectable card debt will be down to about 4.5 percent this quarter, nearly a year earlier than previously expected, said Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein. The improvement echoed comments Wednesday from card lender Capital One Financial Corp.  JPMorgan has been hiring people to work out its problems with mortgages, still the biggest drag on its business. The bank said it hired 10,000 people in the second quarter. It has 250,095 people as of the end of June.  Compensation expenses slid in the last three months as pay for employees in the investment bank declined 22 percent from the first quarter when trading revenue shrank. Compensation costs at the investment bank fell by $730 million to 35 percent of revenue, down from 40 percent in the first quarter.  “When revenues are down, JPM manages to bring down their costs faster than everyone else. That really did cushion some of the earnings decline,” said Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch.

11,COF,"UPDATE 7-JPMorgan profit rises, loan book grows"," * Q2 EPS $1.27 vs Wall Street view $1.21   * Profit lifted by lower costs for bad loans   * CEO Dimon: Time still needed to cure mortgage problems   * Shares up 1.8 percent at close  (Adds sale of 30-year bond, share closing price)   By David Henry   NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) posted a higher-than-expected second-quarter profit as it wrote off fewer bad mortgages and credit card loans.   The second-largest U.S. bank made new loans faster than customers paid off existing ones during the quarter, a reversal from the first quarter and a good sign for a business long plagued by weak loan demand.   JPMorgan’s revenue rose and it added staff in the quarter, and its shares closed 1.8 percent higher on Thursday. But the bank faces big expenses from mortgages as the effects of the housing crisis linger.   Foreclosures could take another 12 to 18 months to start declining, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call with reporters.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   JPMorgan earnings graphic      r.reuters.com/sap62s  Tepid loan demand at JPMorgan  r.reuters.com/daq62s  Breakingviews - Did rivals keep up?        [ID:nN1E76D0DH]   JPMorgan commodities risk up 23 pct        [ID:nN1E76D08G]   TAKE A LOOK                                [ID:nN1E76D0IS]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   “JPMorgan’s revenue growth is a sign that things are getting better. They’re just not getting better quickly,” said Ralph Cole, portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon. Ferguson Wellman owns JPMorgan shares.   Revenue of $27 billion was up 7 percent from a year earlier.   Although loans at the end of the second quarter were up from the end of the first quarter, average loans outstanding declined, signaling that even if loan demand is improving, growth is uneven.   JPMorgan is the first major U.S. bank to post quarterly results. Its performance hints at how other banks fared.   Bond trading revenue fell 18 percent from the first quarter, but the decline was less than some investors feared. Shares of investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) rose on hopes that JPMorgan’s trading results bode well, but turned negative later in the day.   JPMorgan earned $5.43 billion, or $1.27 a share, in the second quarter, beating the average Wall Street estimate by 6 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   The results were up from earnings of $4.8 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier.   The bank benefited from not having to pay a British tax on bonuses. That tax reduced profits by $550 million, or 14 cents a share, last year.   JPMorgan made more loans during the quarter, net of customer loan repayments. Its loan book grew to $689.74 billion at the end of the quarter from $686 billion at the end of March as increased business lending offset a 2 percent decline in consumer lending.   The bank also gathered more deposits during the quarter; deposits rose 5 percent from the first quarter to $1.05 trillion. Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein said mid-sized companies delivered much of the money.   Shrinking loan books and low interest rates since 2008 have made it difficult for banks to post profits, or increase them. A large part of earnings over the past year has come from setting aside less money to cover bad loans, or dipping into funds previously set aside.   Many analysts hope that banks will start to post loan growth in the coming quarters, which would be a sign of sustainable increases in profits.   Dimon, who is famously blunt, seemed optimistic about the outlook for profits. He said the bank will build capital levels in the coming months, and criticized regulators for not allowing it to return those funds to shareholders faster.   “God knows why we have to hold all that capital,” Dimon said, adding that banks’ capital ratios are going “to drive up so fast people are going to be surprised.”   JPMorgan reduced the expense it recorded for credit costs to $1.81 billion in the second quarter from $3.36 billion a year earlier. However, that was up from $1.17 billion in the 2011 first quarter.   After announcing earnings, the bank went to the corporate debt market and sold $1.75 billion of bonds due in 30 years, an unusually long term for bank debt, but JPMorgan’s second 30-year issue in nine months, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters capital markets service.   Mortgage costs were down slightly, but Dimon cautioned that the housing market was still working through difficulties.   “Unfortunately, it will take some time to resolve these issues and it is possible we will incur additional costs along the way,” he said.   JPMorgan expects to have to repurchase $3.6 billion of mortgages that it packaged into bonds. Such repurchases are usually because a bank failed to properly collect payments on the mortgages, or should never have sold them to investors.   JPMorgan said it added $1.3 billion to its litigation reserves, mainly for mortgage-related matters. It also continued to add to its loan reserves for losses on mortgages.   “It is possible we are very over-reserved in mortgage land,” Dimon said in a conference call with analysts.   He expects to win a legal battle with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp over liabilities left from busted lender Washington Mutual, pieces of which JPMorgan bought in a government-arranged deal during the financial crisis.   Credit card delinquencies are improving so quickly that the bank drew down its reserves for losses on those balances, adding 15 cents a share to second-quarter profit.   The charge-off rate for uncollectable card debt will be down to about 4.5 percent this quarter, nearly a year earlier than previously expected, said Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein. The improvement echoed comments Wednesday from card lender Capital One Financial Corp. (COF.N)   JPMorgan has been hiring people to work out its problems with mortgages, still the biggest drag on its business. The bank said it hired 10,000 people in the second quarter. It has 250,095 people as of the end of June.   Compensation expenses slid in the last three months as pay for employees in the investment bank declined 22 percent from the first quarter when trading revenue shrank. Compensation costs at the investment bank fell by $730 million to 35 percent of revenue, down from 40 percent in the first quarter.   “When revenues are down, JPM manages to bring down their costs faster than everyone else. That really did cushion some of the earnings decline,” said Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch.  (Reporting by David Henry and Dan Wilchins.

12,COF,"Wells, Capital One eye HSBC card portfolio: sources","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) are among the bidders for HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HSBA.L) U.S. credit card portfolio, according to sources familiar with the situation.  In a separate HSBC asset sale, U.S. regional banks First Niagara Financial Group FNFG.O, KeyCorp (KEY.N), and M&T Bank Corp (MTB.N) are among the bidders for the bank’s upstate New York branches, sources said.  The asset sales are part of HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver’s plan to turn around Europe’s largest bank by focusing on its main businesses. HSBC has been criticized for “planting flags” around the world with little consideration to profitability.  The bank said in May it may sell the U.S. credit card unit, which has more than $30 billion in assets.  It also said it would shrink its network of 475 U.S. branches to focus on the international business of U.S. clients and the U.S. business of overseas firms, as well as on a revival in the U.S. manufacturing industry.  Capital One is seen as a strongly motivated bidder for the credit card portfolio, after it agreed to buy ING Group’s ING.AS online U.S. bank for $9 billion, according to sources.  The ING deal is expected to leave Capital One with a surplus of deposits, which the bank could use to fund the HSBC credit card loans.  McLean, Virginia-based Capital One was a credit card company that began acquiring banks in the middle of last decade to secure cheaper deposit funding.  Banks are broadly eager to boost their loan books now to increase profits. Loan demand is relatively weak amid the tepid economy, which has tempted many banks to look at acquisitions.  Credit cards have been performing relatively well in recent years, as banks have scaled back lending to marginal borrowers. Capital One and JPMorgan have recently posted strong second-quarter results in their credit card businesses.  Representatives of Capital One, First Niagara, KeyCorp, M&T, and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo declined to comment.  An HSBC spokesman said its asset review is ongoing, and the bank will communicate key milestones when they occur.  Antitrust matters are a big hurdle for some bidders in the branch sale, because many markets in New York are already dominated by just a few players.  For example, if KeyCorp won HSBC’s branches, it would have about 32 percent of the deposits in and around Albany, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp data.  If M&T won, it would own nearly 42 percent of the metro Rochester market. In and around Buffalo, where M&T is based, the bank would end up with more than 65 percent of the deposits.  “They would own Buffalo at that point. It would be ridiculous. M&T would need to make major divestitures if they won,” said Ken Thomas, a consultant who works with banks looking to buy branches.  But one banker not involved in the deal waved off these concerns, noting that the buyer could sell branches to appease regulators the way PNC Financial Services Group (PNC.N) did when it took over National City. PNC ended up selling some branches to Buffalo-based First Niagara.  M&T could have to shed up to $3 billion of deposits in upstate New York, which is doable, the banker said. The cost savings from the deal could yield significant benefits for the bank, even after divestitures, he added.  Another source said several smaller banks could be buyers for any branches that need to be sold as a result.  The banks involved in the HSBC deal have had many questions about which loans will be combined with the branches, sources said.  HSBC corporate clients whose loans are not sold, and who are therefore staying with HSBC, may not be interested in depositing their money in a branch belonging to another bank, sources said. That could influence how many deposits end up staying with the branches, which have about $15 billion of deposits now.  The loans and deposits included in the deal can have a big impact on any buyers’ profit from the branches.  HSBC, which is being advised by JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) on these sales, initially wanted to find one bidder for the businesses. A single transaction could have been simpler, and the bank thought that a buyer for a large credit card portfolio would also like deposits to fund the assets, a source said.  But the bank got comfortable that the credit card and branches could receive a better price separately than bundled together, sources said. A company like Capital One, for example, is more interested in credit cards, while a bank like First Niagara is more interested in bank branches.  JPMorgan declined to comment.  The credit card portfolio includes private label credit cards, which are issued by large retailers. The HSBC portfolio includes cards from companies like Best Buy Co Inc, (BBY.N) Neiman Marcus Group and Saks Inc SKS.N.  Such deals can get complicated because the retailer often has the right to end the relationship if it doesn’t want to move business to the new company, according to sources.  The next round of bids for the branches are expected around the end of the month or beginning of August, one source said.  It wasn’t clear when the next round of bids were due for the credit card business.

14,COF,CORRECTED - IFR-US corporates adapt to volatile new issue market," (Adds missing word ‘billion’ in fourth paragraph)  by Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, July 14 (IFR) - Almost eight weeks of relentless volatility sparked by fears of a European meltdown and a limping US economy has forced US corporates to adopt an different approach to the new issue market.  Ideally corporates like to see at least a few consecutive days of stability before pulling the trigger on a new issue. This month, however, investment grade borrowers are pouncing on any glimmer of good news to push out deals as quickly as possible.  The $13.97bn of deals priced in the first week of July were all done in between days of stomach-churning volatility.  This week has been the same — no deals on Monday because of Greek contagion spreading to Italy, then seven deals raising $6.775 billion squeezed out before Friday’s release of European bank stress tests, and just hours before markets reeled on Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s warning that overzealous cuts to government spending could derail an already fragile US recovery.  No-one seems to want to face the risk that the European authorities might make a catastrophic policy blunder in the months to come.  “Issuers are asking themselves whether they can stomach today’s levels, even though they know there’s a reasonably high likelihood that spreads will be tighter in a month,” said Justin D’Ercole, managing director and head of Americas investment grade debt syndicate at Barclays Capital.  “In most cases, they are comfortable issuing when they can, rather than waiting,” he said. “When you analyze the tail risk scenario to the downside, it feels too ominous to sit back and wait for a better day.”  Capital One Financial (COF.N) is a case in point. This week it came to market with a $2bn common stock offering and a $3bn multi-tranche bond issue to help pay for the $9bn cash-and-stock acquisition of ING Group’s US online banking unit, ING Direct. This is in spite of the fact that the acquisition doesn’t close for several months.  Ironically the spread of Greek contagion to Italy earlier this week provided the market with some doomsday clarity that Europe’s problems aren’t going away any time soon. So issuers may as well jump in and take advantage of still strong investor demand for bonds, rather than wait for volatility to subside and spreads to tighten in again.  “In June the market was hoping for a quick fix for Greece, but now it’s not expecting that anymore and so there’s less reason to wait a week for a better market,” said David Trahan, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate in the Americas for Citigroup.  “Initially borrowers were willing to sit it out and wait for calmer markets, but the volatility has lasted for about seven weeks now,” said D’Ercole. “Their willingness to wait for periods of more consistent, prolonged stability is deteriorating... We’re seeing a change in borrowers’ behavior, where they are more willing to accept an imperfect new issue environment.”  Thankfully the technicals are strong and deals when they come are being oversubscribed and  bid up in the after-market.  “We actually have a little more confidence in the underpinning of the US new issue market right now than we did back in June, and that’s in spite of the fact that if anything, the European situation could get worse,” said Trahan.  “In June we definitely had days when it wasn’t clear there would be a market for a $1bn or a $2bn deal from a certain borrower. Now I know the money is there.”  MANAGING EXPECTATIONS  According to Barclays, the market was looking at net negative supply of between $18bn-$20bn at the end of June, leaving investors hungry for bonds.  At the same time, dealers have pared back inventories, making the new issue market rather than the secondary market the best place to get bonds.  This has given underwriters and issuers alike the confidence to tap the market on the slightest improvement in headlines about Europe and the US economy.  “There is definitely interest in the corporate market and we are selectively buying new deals,” said Rob Crimmins, managing director and investment grade bond portfolio manager at Guardian Life Insurance Company of America.  Crimmins’ fund  bought part of PPL Electric Utilities’ (PPL.N) $250m 30-year first mortgage bond offered earlier this week, a deal which was whispered at a wide 120bp to lure in people like himself.  “Then they priced at 105bp, but we still thought at 105bp it still had some upside left in it,” he said.  It did. PPL is typical of the high quality names that have come to market this month. Its defensive nature made it an attractive investment and its bonds traded in to as tight as 95bp bid, 94bp offered in the after-market.  Getting deals done in a volatile market requires greater finesse on the part of underwriters, which begins with managing issuers’ expectations of how quickly they now have to move.  “Our advice to issuers has been, if you want to get a deal done you need to evaluate the market on a day to day basis,” said Andrew Karp, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate in the Americas for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Underwriters are also initially downplaying the potential size of a deal and luring investors in with juicy unofficial spread talk.  “Timing is also different,” said Trahan. “Normally you have to go-no-go calls at 8.15 or 8.30 but now there are days when deals are being announced later in the morning so there’s time to see how the equity market responds to news overnight and early morning economic data.”  Some single tranche deals are also turning into multi-tranche transactions with different maturities to augment demand and the size of the book.

Getting deals done in a volatile market requires greater finesse on the part of underwriters, which begins with managing issuers’ expectations of how quickly they now have to move.  “Our advice to issuers has been, if you want to get a deal done you need to evaluate the market on a day to day basis,” said Andrew Karp, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate in the Americas for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Underwriters are also initially downplaying the potential size of a deal and luring investors in with juicy unofficial spread talk.  “Timing is also different,” said Trahan. “Normally you have to go-no-go calls at 8.15 or 8.30 but now there are days when deals are being announced later in the morning so there’s time to see how the equity market responds to news overnight and early morning economic data.”  Some single tranche deals are also turning into multi-tranche transactions with different maturities to augment demand and the size of the book.

The issue will fund its previously announced acquisition of ING Groep NV’s U.S. online bank, Capital One said earlier on Wednesday as it reported quarterly results.

18,COF,Capital One profit jumps 50 percent; raises $2 billion,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) said on Wednesday its second-quarter profit jumped 50 percent as fewer customers defaulted on credit cards, a sign consumer loans might be a bright spot for other major banks.  Capital One also raised $2 billion through a stock offering on Wednesday, selling 40 million shares at $50 each. The bank had said the issue would fund its previously announced acquisition of ING Groep NV’s ING.AS U.S. online bank.  Over the next 10 days, most of the top U.S. banks are due to report quarterly results, starting with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) on Thursday.  Capital One, a bank whose results are closely linked to credit cards, earned $911 million, or $1.97 per share, in the second quarter, up from $608 million, or $1.33 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $1.71 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The bank’s profit gains were driven primarily by writing off fewer bad loans and releasing funds previously set aside to cover bad loans. But revenue growth was tepid.  The bank’s net charge-off rate — the percentage of defaulted loans being written off — fell to 2.91 percent from 5.36 percent a year earlier, while revenue rose just 2.3 percent to $3.99 billion. Net interest income edged up to $3.14 billion from $3.1 billion.  Capital One’s credit card charge-offs declined by nearly half, to 5.06 percent from 9.36 percent. The decline matched projections by industry analysts, who note most banks have weeded out their weakest credit card borrowers, nearly three years after the financial crisis peaked, and credit card defaults will continue to shrink.  In a May report, Moodys Corp (MCO.N) analysts projected industrywide credit card charge-offs will decline to a two-decade low of 4 percent by the end of 2012.  Banks are only now starting to ramp up credit card lending. That means that, even if defaults rise, they will not likely rise until next year, since there is often a lag between when a credit card account is opened and when default occurs.  Overall, the amount McLean, Virginia-based Capital One set aside to cover problem loans fell to $343 million in the second quarter from $723 million a year earlier.  Capital One said its $2 billion stock offering will be underwritten by Barclays Capital, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan.  The bank also entered into a forward sale agreement with Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley. The agreement sells shares at the current stock price, but shares will not change hands until seven months after the date of the stock offering.  Chip MacDonald, a banking attorney with Jones Day, said the deal will allow the bank to show regulators that Capital One has the capital to absorb ING’s operations, without additional shareholder dilution months before the acquisition is completed.  In June, the bank announced plans to buy ING’s U.S. online bank for $9 billion in cash and stock.  For Capital One, the deal is part of its push to further expand its banking operation. The company spent much of the past decade transforming from a specialty credit card lender that mainly funded itself in the bond market, into a bank that relies heavily on deposits.  Now, facing weakened loan demand after the financial crisis, the bank is again looking for deals to expand its business. This spring, Capital One bought $3.7 billion of credit card loans from JPMorgan Chase as part of a deal to issue credit cards on behalf of retailer Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N).  The bank may bid on HSBC’s U.S. credit card assets, sources have told Reuters.  For ING, the sale is part of a restructuring forced by a 10 billion euro bailout received during the 2008 financial crisis.  When completed, the deal will make Capital One the seventh-largest U.S. bank by assets.  ING will receive a 9.9 percent stake in Capital One as part of the deal and the right to appoint a board member.  Capital One shares closed down $1.37, or 2.6 percent, at $50.87 on the New York Stock Exchange.

22,COF,E*Trade shares soar on sales push from Citadel,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four years after injecting $2.5 billion into E*Trade Financial Corp (ETFC.O), its biggest investor is pressing the mortgage-plagued online brokerage to put itself up for sale.  Citadel LLC, a powerful hedge fund with a 9.8 percent stake in E*Trade, called on Wednesday for a special shareholder meeting to consider hiring an investment bank that will explore strategic options for the online broker and bank company.  News of the push from Citadel founder Kenneth Griffin sent E*Trade shares surging 14 percent to $14.72 on Wednesday, raising the company’s market value to about $4.2 billion.  “Since November of 2007, the board has continually failed to act in the best interest of E*Trade shareholders,” Citadel’ Chief Legal Officer Adam Cooper wrote in a letter to E*Trade Chief Executive Steven Freiberg. “Having endured nearly four years of value destruction and lost opportunity, we believe it is time for a change.”  A sale of E*Trade could be achieved “promptly,” the letter said.  Chicago-based Citadel also asked E*Trade to replace two long-time directors, Michael Parks and Donna Weaver, with independent directors.  “We were surprised and disappointed by the letter we received this morning,” Freiberg said in a conference call with analysts after the company reported a 34 percent rise in net income on Wednesday afternoon to $47.1 million. “We will be carefully considering the letter received this morning and at this time have no further comment.”  E*Trade’s second-quarter earnings of 16 cents a share, up from 12 cents a year earlier, were fueled by a decline in the loan-loss provision to cover bad mortgages at the company’s bank unit. E*Trade entered banking in an effort to diversify its revenue away from pure retail brokerage, but has struggled with credit problems for many years.  E*Trade has been subject of takeover speculation for years, with brokerage rivals such as TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD.O) and Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) often mentioned as acquirers. TD Ameritrade’s largest shareholder is Canada’s Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO).  E*Trade’s attractions include 2.8 million brokerage accounts and a healthy deposit-gathering business. TD Ameritrade or Schwab could offer as much as $21 a share for the company, a 43 percent premium to E*Trade’s close on Wednesday, and still realize immediate profits from the acquisition, several analysts said.  Other possible buyers for E*Trade include Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), a credit card and retail bank that recently bought ING Direct, BMO Capital Markets analyst David Chiaverini said in a note to clients.  TD Ameritrade CEO Fred Tomczyk said on Tuesday his company has not recently been in negotiations.  “We just haven’t come across anything that makes strategic and financial sense in recent times,” he told Reuters.  A TD Ameritrade spokeswoman declined to comment.  Schwab may be less likely to pursue a deal because it is in the process of buying OptionsXpress Holding Inc OXPS.O.  BMO’s Chiaverini wrote in a report on Wednesday after disclosure of Citadel’s letter that E*Trade is now under pressure to “at least explore the possibility of a sale in an attempt to appease shareholders and gauge the level of interest among potential suitors.”  One roadblock to a sale, analysts said, is $14 billion of subpar mortgages on E*Trade’s books that a buyer would have to mark down to current values.  For Citadel, an E*trade sale would close the books on a rocky four-year relationship.  The aggressive hedge fund was lead investor on a $2.5 billion infusion of cash into the brokerage in 2007, engineered a 2009 share sale and debt swap designed to shore up capital and eliminate $1.7 billion of E*Trade debt during its ownership.  E*Trade, however, has lost more than $2.1 billion from continuing operations over the last three years and its shares have plunged more than 90 percent since June 2007. At that time, they were changing hands at a split-adjusted $257.90 a share. E*Trade completed a 1-for-10 reverse stock split last year.  Citadel has been steadily decreasing its investment, slashing its stake to 9.8 percent now from 27 percent last December. A lock-up agreement that expires on Friday frees it to sell more shares.

24,COF,Exclusive: Paulson says bets were too aggressive,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A humbled John Paulson told investors on Thursday he was “too aggressive” with some of the stock bets in his flagship funds and he is trimming back some of his riskiest holdings.  The hedge fund manager told clients in a conference call that he was dialing back the risk by moving away from bank holdings with heavy mortgage exposure.  The investor call came after a tumultuous first half of the year for Paulson, whose flagship Paulson Advantage fund lost about 12 percent. A related fund called Advantage Plus was off 18 percent.  He told investors that in the wake of the Advantage funds’ hefty losses on Sino Forest, a Chinese lumber and forestry company, he intends to beef up his Asian research team. Paulson did not point fingers at anyone for the Sino Forest debacle. But the manager said his 120-person firm needs to know the region better before it takes new bets.  “We’ll have to strengthen our research capabilities there,” Paulson said on the conference call for investors which Reuters heard portions of.  The billionaire trader said on the call that investing with him would never be free from turbulence, but he said that global economic factors have made this year’s ride bumpier than he is willing to stomach.  Europe’s debt crisis, fears about new financial market regulation and a slow U.S. economic recovery created problems for the New York-based firm, said Paulson, one of the world’s most closely watched investors.  But some of the losses, like Sino Forest, were of his own making. During the call, he took about 100 minutes to explain to investors his missteps and how he was reshaping the portfolio in response the funds’ poor performance this year.  The timing of the call was critical because it came as large institutional investors like state pension funds and wealthy private investors have only a few weeks left to put in a request to withdraw money from the funds. Already, some investors have told Reuters they intend to put in redemptions by the middle of August.  Until this year, Paulson was the toast of the $2 trillion hedge fund world after his big gamble on the collapse of the U.S. housing market made him a billionaire many times over. Paulson now says that his timing may be off on his bet that U.S. economy is poised for a strong rebound.  Paulson conceded that his research analysts were hearing rumblings about problems at Sino Forest for months and that his trading desk received requests to borrow the stock to short it. Indeed Paulson was trimming the position when the Muddy Waters research report alleging account problems hit.  “I should have been more receptive to this information,” Paulson said.  The Advantage Funds oversee roughly $18 billion in assets, a big portion of Paulson & Co’s roughly $38 billion in assets.  Paulson said he cut the net long exposure from roughly 81 percent to about 60 percent, and plans to cut it more. “Eighty-one percent was way too high. We cannot operate the fund at that level,” he said. “I’d like to bring the risk down further to about 50 percent.”  As a long-time owner of large financial companies such as Bank of America (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N), Paulson said the former — his sixth largest position at the end of the first quarter — was “somewhat of a disappointment.”  He said his analysts did not expect the magnitude of the mortgage problems to be so great.  To reposition the portfolio, Paulson said he diversified into financial companies with less exposure to mortgage loans, noting that he liked Capital One (COF.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N), two names he owned at the end of the first quarter.  He also said he increased his bet that the euro currency would fall as a hedge against further fallout from Europe’s debt crisis.

25,COF,Micro-lender Zestcash latest to win VC backing," * Company hopes to turn profitable by early 2012   * ZestCash CEO is former Google CIO Douglas Merrill   * Short-term loans seeing increasing interest from VCs   By Sarah McBride   SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 (Reuters) - The economy has consumers in a stranglehold, and some tech entrepreneurs — and well-heeled venture-capitalists — are taking notice.   Los Angeles-based ZestCash is the latest in a string of short-term consumer-loan companies to win VC backing, landing $11 million in Series A equity financing from a group led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and GRP Partners, plus $8 million in debt financing.   That is on the heels of the $2.3 million that rival Pawngo raised last month from Lightbank, the investment fund of Groupon co-founders Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell, and the 73 million pounds in Series C funding UK-based short-term lender Wonga got earlier this year from a group led by Oak Investment Partners.   A new crop of short-term, high-tech lenders hope to fill a niche neglected by commercial banks, extending credit — at sky-high rates — to riskier borrowers that need a quick cash infusion. With the aid of software, they figure out which would-be borrower in severe need is most likely to be able to repay the loan, typically of a few hundred dollars.   Borrowers who use such services — say, to fix a car — tend to be less financially stable compared with mainstream borrowers, said Arjan Schutte, managing partner of Core Venture Partners, which specializes in non-traditional financing.   But ZestCash and its competitors are counting on turning a profit by figuring out who is likely to be able to pay back the loan. It is a big pool: some 21 million U.S. households are underbanked, meaning they have bank accounts but also rely on alternative financial services such as payday loans or check-cashing services, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.   That corner of finance is “one where application of technology is opening up new avenues to run business,” said Jeremy Liew, managing director of Lightspeed.   At ZestCash, where the co-founder and chief executive is former Google (GOOG.O) chief information officer Douglas Merrill, that technology includes using Google-style algorithms to find likely candidates among the pool of loan applicants.   Co-founder and chief risk officer Shawn Budde, who formerly handled the subprime credit card portfolio at Capital One (COF.N), brings banking chops to the business.   To build its loan model, Zestcash applied what Merrill calls “a big-data approach,” poring through numbers from 20 million loan transactions across California. It came up with several hundred variables to use in evaluating loans, many of them used in counterintuitive ways.   For example, a bankruptcy typically counts against a customer who applies for a traditional loan. But with ZestCash, if the bankruptcy is in the last couple of years, it actually works in the customer’s favor.   “If you declared bankruptcy fairly recently, you are paying attention to your financial situation,” Merrill said, adding that focus means the customer is more likely to pay back a loan.   The loans aren’t cheap. A ZestCash customer with a typical loan — $500 for five months — would end up paying a total of $860, or $360 in fees.   But that’s much cheaper than consumers’ other options if they have poor or thin credit, said Merrill. For example, a $500 payday loan rolled over for five months would likely cost about $1,400, said Merrill, meaning the customer would pay $900 in fees.   The typical ZestCash customer uses the funds for healthcare expenses or car repairs, said Merrill. He was inspired to launch the service when his sister-in-law, a working single mother driving on icy roads in Washington state, needed money for new tires.   Merrill plans to use the new funding for purposes such as marketing and expanding beyond ZestCash’s current service area of Utah, Idaho, Missouri and South Dakota.   The company has a loanbook of “a few million dollars” and believes it will turn an operating profit early next year. Merrill said its current default rate as a percent of all loans was in the low 20s.   Additional investors included Flybridge Capital in the equity portion of the funding round and Lighthouse Capital Partners for the debt portion.

26,COF,"UPDATE 4-CIT Group posts loss, says new loans increase"," * Q2 loss 24 cents/share vs year-earlier profit 91 cents   * Prepaid $2.5 bln of second-lien debt in second quarter   * New loan volume increases   * Shares rise 4 percent  (Adds closing stock price)   By David Henry   NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc (CIT.N), the business lender run by Wall Street executive John Thain, posted a smaller-than-expected loss as it boosted the rates it charges for leasing railway cars and aircraft.   Restructuring charges from the company’s 2009 bankruptcy pushed the company to a $48 million loss for the quarter, or 24 cents a share, compared with analysts’ average forecast of a loss of 32 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   The bank earned a profit of $181.6 million, or 91 cents a share in the same quarter last year.   The restructuring charges come from CIT buying back debt, a step it is taking along with changing the terms of the company’s bond documentation, or indentures, to make the junk-rated company more like the investment-grade issuer it intends to be.   The “initiatives further reduce cost of capital and position CIT for long-term success and profitability,” Thain said in a statement.   CIT shares rose $1.54, or nearly 4 percent, to close at 41.19.   Thain, a former Merrill Lynch chief executive, was hired in February 2010 to restructure CIT after its bankruptcy,   The company paid $2.5 billion of second-lien debt in the quarter, ahead of schedule.   CIT also said it has ordered 5,000 new railcars to add to its fleet of more than 100,000. Thain told analysts that lease rates for railcars and aircraft are increasing.   Thain has been working to secure enough low-cost replacement financing to ramp up lending. In the second quarter, the company arranged new financing facilities in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Committed new business volume was $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in the first quarter and $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2010, the company said.   Despite the new business, earning assets for the quarter fell $6 billion to $34 billion from the 2010 second quarter as borrowers repaid loans and the company sold assets.   Later this year CIT’s bank subsidiary will begin taking deposits over the Internet, Thain said. Building that business is cheaper than buying it from another company, he said.   CIT reportedly considered buying the U.S. Internet banking business of ING Groep ING.AS of the Netherlands. Capital One Financial (COF.N) bought it instead.   The company’s financial results are being complicated by one-time fees for early debt repayments, gains from asset sales and adjustments for so-called fresh start accounting that reset the value of its assets and liabilities when CIT emerged from bankruptcy.   Under fresh-start accounting, CIT results are pulled down when the company repays its debt, whose value was marked down in bankruptcy. By the same token, when CIT’s customers repay loans whose value was also marked down, earnings get a lift.   CIT shares have struggled this year, falling 16 percent though Monday. The stock soared 70 percent in 2010 following the company’s exit from bankruptcy in December 2009. The shares have tended to rise and fall with movements in the junk bond market, where CIT debt trades, according to analyst Matthew Schultheis of brokerage Boenning & Scattergood.

27,COF,HSBC sheds U.S. branches in $1 billion First Niagara pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc on Sunday said it will shed nearly half of its underperforming U.S. branch network, selling 195 branches to First Niagara Financial Group Inc for about $1 billion, and closing 13 others.  The all-cash sale to First Niagara covers more than 40 percent of HSBC’s roughly 470 U.S. branches, including 183 in upstate New York, six in New York City suburbs and six in Connecticut. It also includes $15 billion of deposits, $2.8 billion of loans and $4.3 billion of assets under management.  Following the transaction, Buffalo, New York-based First Niagara expects to be significantly larger, with about 450 branches, $38 billion of assets and $30 billion of deposits. It expects to divest some branches to meet antitrust concerns. An early 2012 closing is expected, pending regulatory approvals.  HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver in May set plans for Europe’s largest bank to slash $3.5 billion of costs by cutting back in retail banking and selling its U.S. credit card unit, which has more than $30 billion of assets.  The bank has been criticized for spreading itself too widely, with roughly 95 million customers and 300,000 employees in 87 markets, without sufficient regard for profitability.  Forty-two percent of HSBC businesses are returning less than its 11 percent cost of capital, and the bank has said it will exit Russia and Poland.  HSBC is expected on Monday to report first-half results. Analysts on average expect a pretax profit of $10.9 billion, compared with $11.1 billion a year earlier.  In May, HSBC said its U.S. banking unit HSBC Bank USA had a “record of underperformance,” and that it would focus its operations on U.S. clients with international business and non-U.S. clients with business in the United States.  “HSBC is committed to the U.S. and leveraging our international network and skill-set, which are our competitive advantages,” Niall Booker, chief executive of HSBC North America, said in a statement on Sunday.  The 13 branches that HSBC plans to close are located in Connecticut and New Jersey, and are near other HSBC branches. HSBC has about 370 branches in New York.  The bank did not immediately return requests on Sunday for further comment.  Other bidders for the branches included KeyCorp and M&T Bank Corp, while bidders for the credit card unit have included Capital One Financial Corp and Wells Fargo & Co, people familiar with the matter said earlier in July.  First Niagara Chief Executive John Koelmel in an interview said his bank expects to divest 20 percent to 25 percent of the 195 HSBC branches to satisfy regulators and reduce overlap.  “We have staked out a footprint that runs from Buffalo to Boston to Philly and back to Pittsburgh,” he said. “It is all about having meaningful presence in the markets we choose to serve.”  Koelmel also said he was “sensitive” to valuations, especially given that the transaction is all cash, at a time of uncertainty about the economy and market environment.  “You can argue that this is a horrible time to do anything: Washington can’t do anything, and markets are in a state of high alert,” he said. “It’s somewhere between a mess and an embarrassing train wreck. I’m always one who believes that in the private sector we have to have the courage to lead in spite of that. We can’t be unduly deterred by what the markets in general are doing.”  First Niagara expects the transaction to boost operating earnings, after merger costs, by 10 percent to 11 percent in 2012. It plans to issue $750 million to $800 million of stock and $350 million to $400 million of debt before the closing.  Most of the 1,900 workers at the 195 HSBC branches are expected to keep their jobs, including at branches that are sold, First Niagara said.  First Niagara said it was advised by Goldman Sachs & Co, Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP and the law firm Pepper Hamilton, while HSBC was advised by its own investment bankers, JPMorgan and the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.  Shares of First Niagara closed Friday at $12.25 on the Nasdaq.

32,COF,DEALTALK-Insurers covet Eurasia units ING wants to float," (For more Reuters DEALTALK stories click )	   By Douwe Miedema	   LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - ING could get a far bigger pay-out if it ditched a plan to spin-off its Asian and European insurance units as a single stock market-listed business and instead chose buyers from a long list of interested parties.	   A trade sale would enable the Dutch bank to unlock the high value in its Eastern European and the Asian operations, and avoid tainting them with the business in the Netherlands, where insurance portfolios trade below book value.	   “A lot of people are interested in it. A lot of external parties have talked to them to register interest. They know there is interest, it’s a matter of price,” said one investment banker who asked not to be identified.	   Two other investment bankers said that a long queue of insurers had held discussions with ING from about the beginning of the year. The talks were entirely informal.	   The European Union has ordered ING to split its bank and insurance operations, and to sell a swathe of assets as payback for a 10 billion euro ($14.2 billion) capital injection from the Dutch state during the credit crisis.	   Chief Executive Jan Hommen — a 68-year old who was formerly finance chief at aluminium producer Alcoa and then at Philips Electronics — has been in charge of the effort ever since taking ING’s helm in 2009.	   He proved to be a savvy dealmaker when he sold ING’s Latin American operation to Colombia’s relatively unknown GrupoSura  for 2.6 billion euros ($3.7 billion) last month. ING had first said it would float the business. 	   He is now readying ING’s Eurasian and its U.S. business for two Initial Public Offerings (IPO) to take place in the course of 2012. But this is ING’s “base case” scenario, a wording suggesting it does not rule out a trade sale.	   Properly valuing the European and Asian operations is hard, because ING has yet to allocate debt to the units. It is a job that bankers expect ING to take on in the second half of the year.	   ING will publish mid-year results on Aug 4.	   Hommen can count on the support of Ivo Lurvink, a former Credit Suisse banker, who also headed mergers and acquisitions at Philips. Lurvink has been in charge of ING’s divestment programme since 2009.	   Germany’s Allianz was one of the many European insurers that had looked into the business at this early stage, according to a person familiar with the situation. But Europe’s largest insurer had now lost interest.	   Other European insurers, such as Zurich Financial , Generali , AXA , Munich Re (MUVGn.DE) and Germany’s Talanx all declined to comment.	   The Eurasian business has a value on ING’s books of 15 billion euros, though that number will get lower once the group allocates debt to the units. At 8.5 billion euros, the Benelux arm is the biggest part.	   It is also the least attractive, with virtually no growth, and posing an immense burden on capital for any unlikely prospective buyer. Dutch insurance businesses trade at some 0.5 to 0.6 times book value, analysts and bankers said.	   By contrast there is huge interest in Eastern European and Asian insurance, which may may trade up to 2 times book value. The sale of Polish peer insurer Warta by Belgium’s KBC  for instance, is closely watched. 	   And Prudential’s bold bid last year to grab the life insurance business of AIG for $35.5 billion — which nearly wrecked CEO Tidjane Thiam’s career — was a sign of the temptations of the Asian life insurance market.	   Lumping the three regions together in an IPO would value the business at a level that will be heavily dragged down by the Benelux operations. Rabobank analyst Cor Kluis puts the number at 1.1 times book value.	   That would value ING’s Eurasian business at 10.1 billion euros, according to Rabobank.	   On the other hand, sorting the business in three different regions will allow ING to attract a takeover premium — which can be as high as 30 percent. In that case, the blended multiple could amount to 1.5 times book value.	   The risk ING has to weigh is that it gets stuck with just the less attractive Benelux business. And any sale needs to be timed well, to avoid being upstaged by others.	   “ING is not the only bank trying to unload insurance assets. The fear is that too many assets wil come onto the market at the same time in 2012/2013,” a senior manager at a major European insurance group said, asking not to be named.

The McLean, Virginia-based firm said in June it was buying ING’s ING.AS U.S. online bank for $9 billion in cash and stock.   HSBC said in May it was looking to sell its U.S. card arm, which has about $31 billion of loans, as part of a radical overhaul and $3.5 billion cost-cutting plan under new Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver. [ID:nH9E7FS004]   Capital One has been seen as a motivated buyer for the business as it looks to bulk up on assets after the ING Direct deal. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) was also interested in buying the portfolio, sources have said previously.   “These discussions are ongoing and no decision has yet been made to proceed with any transaction,” HSBC said in a statement on Tuesday. Gulliver said last week the bank was making progress in the planned sale.   HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, last week said it will shed nearly half of its underperforming U.S. branch network, selling 195 branches to First Niagara Financial Group Inc FNFG.O for $1 billion and closing 13 more. [ID:nN1E76U0A2]   HSBC has been criticised for spreading itself too widely, gathering roughly 95 million customers across 87 markets, and Gulliver is aiming to put focus back on profitability.   Bankers have called HSBC’s U.S. cards a tough sale because not many buyers remain for such large credit card portfolios since the financial crisis.   A regulatory crackdown has made it harder to turn a profit, and industry observers have said it could be difficult for HSBC to get the premium it wants for the value of the business on its books.    Since 2007, both Citigroup Inc (C.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N) have tried — and failed — to sell similar large U.S. credit card portfolios. For a related DealTalk, click on [ID:nN11249346].   Gulliver has said that HSBC will wind down the credit card business if it cannot find a buyer.   HSBC’s London-listed shares were down 2.2 percent by 1310 GMT, recovering some losses after touching their lowest level for two years.   Capital One spent much of the past decade transforming from a specialty credit card lender that mainly funded itself in the bond market, into a bank that relies heavily on deposits.  Now, facing weakened loan demand after the financial crisis, the bank is again looking for deals to expand its business.

36,COF,Capital One bulks up U.S. cards with HSBC deal,"NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) agreed to buy HSBC’s (HSBA.L) U.S. credit card arm for $2.6 billion more than the face value of the loans, the latest in a string of acquisitions for the credit card company turned U.S. bank.  The deal will lift profits starting in 2013 for Capital One, whose recent acquisitions include ING Groep’s online U.S. bank, a $9 billion transaction announced in June. Chief Executive Richard Fairbank has turned the specialty credit-card lender into a broader retail bank through serial dealmaking.  For HSBC, the sale is part of a drive by new Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver to streamline its business and cut costs by $3.5 billion a year.  HSBC will gain $2.4 billion on the sale after taxes, and boost its capital levels. But it will also lose earnings.  The sale further unravels HSBC’s disastrous $15 billion purchase of U.S. consumer lending firm Household in 2003, which triggered billions of dollars of subprime mortgage losses. Executives now say the purchase of Household, which included the credit card business, was a mistake.  Capital One is paying a premium to assets of about 8.75 percent, a low price by historical standards, and its shares rose 0.7 percent, while HSBC’s declined 5.3 percent in London. Capital One was one of the few major bank stocks to rise in a difficult session for the sector.  “They paid a lower price than we anticipated, which speaks to what the market is like now,” said Chris Brendler, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore.  Portfolios often attracted premiums of 10 percent in the 2000s and 20 percent in the 1990s, Brendler said. There are few recent comparable sales to benchmark this one against.  Capital One will raise about $1.25 billion of equity to help bolster its capital position after the deal. Up to $750 million could be through issuing shares to HSBC at $39.23 each, while the rest of the purchase will be made in cash.  Capital One has twice swooped in for unwanted U.S. assets from a retreating European bank in recent months, including the June deal for ING’s ING.AS U.S. online bank, which will give it on some $80 billion of additional deposits.  Bankers viewed Capital One as the most motivated bidder on the HSBC credit card portfolio because it needed assets to invest the ING deposits in.  Fairbank co-founded Capital One in 1988. Since the middle of the last decade, he has been adding banking assets to Capital One to diversify its revenue and give the company stable deposit funding. The vast majority of his pay is in the form of Capital One shares.  For HSBC, the sale will free up capital when banks are under pressure to bolster their balance sheets, but it will not help Gulliver’s task of lifting profitability, as the U.S. credit card portfolio was a high-return business.  “Selling a business that makes an annualized 30 percent return on equity and parking the cash is clearly dilutive,” said Mike Trippitt, an analyst at Oriel Securities in London.  HSBC will boost its consolidated core Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio by 60 basis points to 11.4 percent. The bank will use the proceeds from the sale to repay debt, among other purposes.  The U.S. credit card portfolio earned $1 billion in pretax profit in the first half of 2011 and was consistently profitable during the downturn.  The portfolio includes about $9.4 billion of bank-issued credit cards, mainly MasterCard accounts, as well as $12.7 billion of “retail partner” cards, including Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. The remaining $7.6 billion are co-branded cards with parties including General Motors Co.  HSBC last week said it will shed nearly half of its underperforming U.S. branch network, selling 195 branches to First Niagara Financial Group Inc FNFG.O for $1 billion and closing 13 more.  Earlier this month, HSBC said it will cut 30,000 jobs as it slashes costs and retreats from countries such as Russia, Poland and the United States, where it lacks scale or is struggling to compete.  HSBC has been criticized for spreading itself too widely, gathering roughly 95 million customers across 87 markets, and Gulliver is aiming to put focus back on profitability.  The revamp, aimed at sharpening its focus on Asia, reverses a strategy that has been criticized for planting flags around the world.

40,COF,"Kohl's sales, profit outlook upbeat","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) raised its full-year profit forecast, saying its portfolio of merchandise that only it sells has protected its gross margin, and the retailer forecast further sales gains, sending its shares up nearly 9 percent late Thursday morning.  The department store chain expects same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to rise 2 percent to 4 percent in the current quarter.  Kohl’s, with customers who are middle class but typically less affluent than those of rival Macy’s Inc (M.N), said gross margins have been lifted, despite rising cotton costs, by its efforts to offer shoppers items they can’t find elsewhere, particularly its celebrity clothing lines.  That merchandise, along with an “aggressive” marketing campaign planned for the fall, are designed to help Kohl’s win market share from rivals even as shoppers threaten to pull back, Kohl’s Chief Executive Kevin Mansell told Reuters.  “There isn’t anything happening in the world that’s going to make our consumer feel any better- if anything, they’re going to feel worse,” he said.  The company’s roster of exclusives includes Simply Vera Wang and will be expanded next month to include lines by performers Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony.  In recent years, Kohl’s and its competitors have been in a race to offer more exclusive merchandise to differentiate themselves and gain more ability to price those items as they see fit. About half of Kohl’s sales now come from those lines.  Kohl’s, which operates nearly 1,100 department stores, raised its full-year earnings per share forecast for fiscal 2011 by 20 cents, to a range of $4.45 to $4.60, above analysts’ average forecast of $4.40.  Second-quarter profit rose 16.5 percent to $303 million, or $1.09 a share, from $260 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat the $1.08 a share Wall Street analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  As previously reported, sales in the quarter were up 3.6 percent to $4.2 billion and same-store sales rose 1.9 percent.  On Wednesday, Macy’s and Polo Ralph Lauren (RL.N) also raised their sales outlooks.  Kohl’s shares rose $3.80, or 8.6 percent, to $48.09 in late morning trading. Shares of rival J.C. Penney Co, (JCP.N) which reports results on Friday, were up 6.4 percent. Macy’s rose 4.5 percent.  Kohl’s forecast gross margin would hold steady in the current quarter, suggesting it has been able to pass on higher cotton costs to shoppers.  “The gross margin forecast is a good indicator of how their consumer is accepting price increases,” said Walter Stackow, a portfolio manager with asset manager Manning & Napier.  Stackow said the current market turmoil could eventually hurt sales if it lasts, but said shoppers will get some relief from lower gas prices.  Kohl’s expects gross margin in the current quarter to range from up 0.1 percentage point to down 0.1 percentage point.  Mansell said in an earlier press release that profits were helped by a credit card deal with Capital One (COF.N)as bad debt expenses have fallen significantly compared to last year.  Kohl’s is planning to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in the current quarter.  The company also said it would restate its 2010 results, as well as those for its first two quarters of the current fiscal year, by September 13 and re-categorize rent expense for some of its leases as depreciation and interest expense instead.  Last week, the company disclosed it had identified some errors in how it accounted for those store leases.

45,COF,UPDATE 2-Paulson slashes stake in Bank of America," * Paulson cuts Bank of America stake   * Sticks with SPDR Gold Trust  (Adds details on other holdings, Paulson’s investment style, background, bylines)   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Ashley Lau   NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor John Paulson, whose flagship funds are down some 30 percent for the year to date, cut back on one of his biggest holdings but largely kept the other major holdings unchanged.   Weeks after telling investors in July that he had been overly aggressive with some of his calls, Paulson showed the world that he began scaling back and diversifying within the financial sector during the second quarter.   At the end of June Paulson owned 60.4 million shares in Bank of America (BAC.N), down from 124 million at the end of the first quarter.   Paulson had told investors on that rare conference call in July that he was surprised by the size of Bank of America’s mortgage problems and said he would be shifting money into financial companies with fewer problems.   He had already begun to do so.   In the second quarter he raised his stake in Wells Fargo (WFC.N) to 33.6 million shares from 20.5 million shares and lifted his stake in Capital One (COF.N) to 21.1 million shares from 18 million shares. [nN1E7780AL]   While Paulson was clearly adjusting some holdings, the moves were too small to save his roughly $35 billion fund firm from the battering it endured over the last few weeks as Bank of America’s stock price declined further. In the last three months the company’s shares have tumbled 41.07 percent.   Paulson is known for making big bets and sticking with them often for very long periods.   On Aug. 11 Reuters wrote in a Special Report [nN1E7780AL] that some hedge fund industry analysts and investors were beginning to worry that Paulson’s Advantage funds, his two largest portfolios, were too large and taking mutual-fund style bets on too many stocks.   One thing that has helped Paulson is that his firm has kept its stake in the SPDR Gold Trust unchanged at 31.5 million. It is the firm’s biggest holding and one of its most profitable given the surge in gold prices,   The funds’ holdings of Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG.N), Paulson’s seventh largest holding, were cut to 40.5 million shares from 43.9 million shares. His holdings of SunTrust Banks (STI.N) were reduced to 32.1 million shares from 34.3 million shares. And he trimmed his MGM Resorts International (MGM.N) holdings to 41.7 million shares from 43.8 million shares.   AngloGold Ashanti AU_pa.N, Paulson’s second biggest position, weighed in at 39.9 million shares, down only slightly from 41 million shares.   In the past, especially when he bet against the overheated U.S. housing market, Paulson’s ability to spot trends early and stick with them has paid off big for himself and investors.   This time around though some investors are beginning to worry that Paulson has lost his magic touch, particularly now that the economy is not recovering as quickly as he initially forecast.

46,COF,Rep. Frank wants closer look at Capital One-ING,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior lawmaker asked the Federal Reserve on Thursday for more public scrutiny of Capital One Financial Corp’s proposed purchase of ING Groep NV’s online bank ING Direct.  Representative Barney Frank, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, sent a letter to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, seeking a 60-day extension of the public comment period on the deal and public hearings on it.  “This proposed purchase would create the fifth-largest bank in the United States. For this reason alone, care should be taken to thoroughly examine the impact,” Frank wrote.  Capital One agreed in June to buy ING Direct from the Dutch banking and insurance group for $9 billion in stock and cash. ING had to sell the business, one of the jewels of its retail banking franchise, as part of a deal with the European Commission following its October 2008 Dutch government bailout.  Frank cited concerns about the transaction’s impact on consolidation of banking assets, the availability of credit from the resulting bank and community programs.  “A number of national consumer, civil rights and housing advocacy groups have raised concerns about the practices of the acquiring bank, including its track record with regard to previous acquisitions,” Frank said in the letter.  “These concerns merit an extension of the comment period in order to allow a thorough investigation,” he said.  In a lengthy statement in response to Frank’s letter, Capital One said the ING deal would actually decrease its risk profile and would expand public access to banking services.  “After the acquisition, the resulting institution, with just over $300 billion in assets, remains very much in line with other regional banks in terms of size and simplicity,” Capital One said. “(The) combined organization will remain well below the trillion dollar balance sheets of the largest U.S. banks and will not engage in the types of risky investment banking activities that can generate systemic risk.”  In late-morning trade Capital One shares fell 5 percent to $42.25, a slightly sharper drop than the broader markets. U.S.-listed shares of ING fell 8 percent to $8.12, in line with the declines ING recorded in Amsterdam.

49,COF,Fed's Hoenig says doesn't see recession looming,"JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming (Reuters) - The U.S. economy will continue to grow at a modest pace as consumers and businesses pare back excessive amounts of debt, a top Federal Reserve official said.  “I don’t see a double-dip recession,” Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, said in an interview with Reuters Insider television.  The world’s largest economy should expand by between 2 percent and 2.5 percent over the remainder of this year, said Hoenig, whose institution is hosting an annual conference in this mountain valley that draws central bankers and leading economists from around the world.  Hoenig played down the significance of two recent gloomy regional reports on manufacturing. Surveys by the Philadelphia and Richmond Fed banks showing weak factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Central Atlantic regions were taken during a period of stock market turmoil and likely reflected the uncertainty of that period, he said.  A similar survey by the Kansas City Fed covering Kansas and surrounding states released on Thursday was soft, but not as dramatically so.  Hoenig has been a persistent critic of the Fed’s ultra-loose monetary policy stance, arguing it is likely to perpetuate a cycle of boom and bust and could sow the seeds of inflation.  He is at odds with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and others on the central bank’s monetary policy panel, which earlier this month bolstered its commitment to hold interest rates at rock bottom levels by saying it expected to keep them there for at least the next two years.  In late June, the Fed said it envisioned economic growth of between 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent for this year and 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent for 2012.  Private economists, however, have cut their expectations sharply since that projection was released, and many expect the U.S. central bank will ease monetary policy further.  The Fed lowered overnight interest rates to near zero in December 2008 and bought $2.3 trillion in bonds in a further effort to lift growth.  Financial markets will eye a speech here by Bernanke on Friday for any hints the Fed may renew bond buying or shift its holdings into longer maturities to try to put further downward pressure on medium- to long-term interest rates.  The Fed’s aggressive monetary easing has drawn fire from U.S. politicians, including recent broadsides by Republican presidential candidates. Hoenig said that despite the political rhetoric, he believes the Fed is widely respected.  “I wish there was an overnight solution but there isn’t, so they look to blame someone,” he said.  Hoenig said he does not believe Congress will decide to rein in the powers of the regional Fed banks as a result of an ongoing study of the Fed system.  The study, due in October, was commissioned in conjunction with a regulatory overhaul that followed the 2007-2009 financial crisis. One of the concerns that prompted the study was that the Fed system, in which bankers sit on the boards of regional Fed banks, allows too cozy a relationship between banks and their regulators.  The Kansas City Fed chief has long warned of the dangers of allowing banks to grow so large the government would not allow them to fail for fear of a domino effect.  He said he has serious doubts about Capital One Financial Corp’s proposed purchase of ING Groep NV’s online bank ING Direct.  “I have very grave concerns about allowing these amalgamations of institutions that by their very structure are too big to fail, too interconnected to fail and I think the burden should be very heavily against that,” Hoenig said.

51,COF,"Fed to hold hearings on Capital One, ING deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve announced on Friday that it will hold three public meetings on the proposed purchase of ING Groep NV’s online bank ING Direct by Capital One Financial Corp.  The hearings will be held in September and October in Washington, Chicago and San Francisco.  The Fed also announced that it will extend the public comment period on the deal through October 12.  The Fed said the hearings will help it determine if the deal will “produce benefits to the public” that “outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, unsound banking practices, and risk to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system.”  Capital One agreed in June to buy ING Direct from the Dutch banking and insurance group for $9 billion in stock and cash. ING had to sell the business, one of the jewels of its retail banking franchise, as part of a deal with the European Commission following its October 2008 Dutch government bailout.  Capital One said in a statement on Friday that it respects the board’s decision to hold hearings and looks forward to “telling our story.”  Some consumer groups and members of Congress have called on the Fed to further scrutinize the deal.  Earlier this month, Representative Barney Frank, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, wrote the Fed asking that hearings be held and the comment period extended.  “This proposed purchase would create the fifth-largest bank in the United States,” Frank wrote. “For this reason alone, care should be taken to thoroughly examine the impact.”  Consumer groups have questioned the deal, arguing it would create the type of “too big to fail” bank that the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law is suppose to discourage.  They also have taken aim at Capital One, arguing the bank does not provide enough home loans to low-income communities and has “predatory” credit card practices.  “We have serious concerns about the impact of the deal on consumers, communities and the economy,” National Community Reinvestment Coalition President John Taylor said in an August 17 release. “Why rush to create another Too-Big-to-Fail bank?”  Capital One has pushed back against complaints, arguing the new entity would have a little more than $300 billion in assets, far less than the biggest U.S. banks.  “In each of our prior bank acquisitions, we have substantially increased our investments that serve lower income communities, providing $2.2 billion over and above those predecessor banks in their footprints,” the bank said in a statement on Friday. “Furthermore, we are actually adding thousands of jobs to (the) economy at a time when many financial services companies are announcing sizable reductions.”  ",8262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial-regulation-capitolone/fed-to-hold-hearings-on-capital-one-ing-deal-idUSTRE77P6NF20110826

Banks across New York City are making provisions so people will be able to get hard currency Sunday and Monday, even if Hurricane Irene knocks power out and floods branches.  One of the enduring lessons from the hurricanes of 2005 is that cash is crucial in a storm zone for basic staples, yet often difficult to come by. After Katrina, for example, ATMs across New Orleans simply did not work.  With that in mind, people scrambled to ATMs on Friday and Saturday morning across New York and New Jersey, often withdrawing hundreds of dollars to prepare.  JPMorgan Chase & Co kept its Chase branches open late Friday night and opened some early on Saturday, though like most every other business in the city they closed early ahead of the 12 p.m. EDT shutdown of regional mass transit.  The bank has extra “cash packs” ready to supply branches Monday morning and may deploy mobile ATMs, which are wireless and run on battery power, in hard-hit areas like the Financial District of lower Manhattan.  Bank of America Corp said Saturday it may do much the same thing, but on a larger scale.  The bank has commercial trucks with generators and built-in ATMs, both smaller cash-only units and full feature machines that allow deposits. It also has mobile branches — effectively trailer homes — with teller windows and offices.  Across the board, other major New York banks also said they took extra precautions.  “Capital One Bank topped off all of our ATMs prior to the closure of our branches in the Northeast.

House Financial Services Chairman Spencer Bachus said the move is unnecessary.   “At a time of anemic growth and record high joblessness, unwarranted delays in the regulatory review process only add to the pervasive uncertainty that is holding back our economy,” Bachus wrote in an Aug. 31 letter to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.

57,COF,Fed asks for more information on Capital One deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has asked Capital One Financial Corp to provide more information about its proposed acquisition of ING Groep NV’s online bank ING Direct in advance of a hearing next week.  The Fed, in an August 29 letter, asked the bank to detail areas where the two banks’ businesses overlap and what their market share is in these areas.  Among the areas where the Fed is seeking more information are securities lending, commercial paper, credit card lending and mortgage servicing.  The Fed said last month it would extend the comment period on the deal and would hold three public hearings. The first is scheduled for September 20 in Washington.  Some consumer and low-income housing groups are pushing the Fed to scrutinize the deal under a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law that requires regulators to determine if an acquisition would create a bank so large that its failure would threaten the stability of financial markets.  They are viewing the Fed’s request for additional information as evidence this concern is being taken seriously, said a spokesman for the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.  Capital One has pushed back against this argument, noting the new bank would be far smaller than Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.  If the purchase goes through the new entity would be the seventh-largest U.S. bank, with more than $300 billion in assets, according to SNL Financial, a financial services data firm.  The request for information was first reported on Sunday by The Wall Street Journal.  A spokeswoman for Capital One said on Sunday that the bank has responded to the Fed and the information provided “confirms that we are not engaged in the kind or level of activities that raise the systemic risk issues that the Dodd-Frank Act sought to address.”  Capital One agreed in June to buy ING Direct from the Dutch banking and insurance group for $9 billion in stock and cash.

Capital One was pressed by the Fed in an August 29 letter for details about “the nature and dollar volume” of financial activities in which both companies are involved, the Journal said.  Fed officials asked Capital One to describe any markets where the bank and ING Direct USA are market makers and to report information about exposure to counterparties, the newspaper said.  The Fed declined to comment to the Journal.  Capital One spokeswoman Tatiana Stead told Reuters: “Our response confirms that we are not engaged in the kind or level of activities that raise the systemic risk issues that the Dodd-Frank Act sought to address.”  “Further, after this merger we will still represent only 1.5 percent of the deposit market, well below the larger institutions,” Stead said in a statement.  Following last year’s Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, the Fed now must consider whether specific mergers and acquisitions would increase overall risk to the financial system.  The Federal Reserve could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours.  In June, Capital One had agreed to buy U.S. online banking business ING Direct from ING Groep in a stock and cash deal valued at $9 billion.  ING had to sell the business, one of the jewels of its retail banking franchise, as part of a deal with the European Commission following its October 2008 Dutch government bailout.

64,COF,PRESS DIGEST - Wall Street Journal - Sept 12," Sept 12 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in The Wall Street Journal on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.	   * France’s largest private-sector banks will likely suffer further credit-rating downgrades this week, the latest sign that the debt crisis on the euro zone’s periphery is slowly infecting the core of the region’s financial system.	   * As middle-market shoppers trade down to cheaper goods, the divide grows between high-end and low-end shoppers.	   * Frank Quattrone, a top technology banker once sidelined by regulatory woes, has returned to big-time deal making partly by tapping a network of former clients, including several executives who held controversial “Friends of Frank” brokerage accounts containing hot initial public offerings.	   * Richard Sylla, a financial historian at New York University’s Stern School of Business, sees better days ahead for stocks, albeit in a few years.	   * The Fed asked Capital One Financial Corp to respond to questions that appear aimed at determining whether the proposed acquisition of  ING Groep NV’s U.S. online-banking business would create a bank so large and complex that its failure would pose a risk to the financial system.	   * A troubled partnership of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Suzuki Motor appeared on the verge of collapse after the German company said its Japanese partner violated their contract by agreeing to buy diesel engines from another car maker.	   * Just as the nuclear industry faces growing uncertainty brought on by the crisis in Japan, Toshiba is having to spend more than $1.6 billion to raise its stake in U.S.-based nuclear-energy company Westinghouse Electric Co. to 87 percent from the current 67 percent.	   * U.S. financial regulators are likely to miss an October deadline for the Volcker rule, a hotly contested part of last year’s financial-overhaul law that limits financial firms from trading with their own money.	   * Thailand, the world’s biggest rice exporter by volume, is placing a hefty, and some economists say reckless, bet that prices for the grain will spiral higher as demand increases.	   * Booming demand for BlackBerrys in Indonesia and elsewhere in the developing world is lifting hopes that Research In Motion   still might have the means to grow even as market share for its smartphone plummets in the U.S. and other wealthy countries.	   * WellPoint Inc and International Business Machines Corp are set to announce a deal on Monday for the health insurer to use the Watson technology, the first time the high-profile project will result in a commercial application.	   * Much of the blame for Yahoo Inc’s lack of revenue growth in recent years fell on Chief Executive Carol Bartz. Now, that investor angst has shifted to Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock.

69,COF,Fed's Tarullo questions benefits of big banks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top Federal Reserve official on Thursday questioned the economic benefits of mega banks and other large financial companies.  Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said currently there is limited evidence to show that big financial firms produce “economies of scale” beyond services related to processing payments such as debit and credit card purchases.  Big banks have been lobbying against global reforms — such as capital surcharges — that would make it more expensive for firms that are large and complex. They argue that they should not be punished for their size, and that large corporations need large banks.  Tarullo’s comments also came as the Fed weighs whether to approve Capital One Financial Corp’s proposed $9 billion acquisition of ING Groep NV’s online bank ING Direct.  Some consumer groups have pressured the Fed to scrutinize the systemic risk posed by the deal.  Tarullo told a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve on Thursday that the economies of scale issue needs to be studied further.  “Generally, though, even where intuition suggests economies in some other areas — such as the breadth of securities distribution networks and the ability to provide all forms of financing in significant amounts — evidence for the existence of such economies is limited and mixed,” he said.  Tarullo said the new regulatory regime laid out in last year’s Dodd-Frank financial oversight law only increases the importance of understanding “the social utility of the largest, most complex financial firms.”  Dodd-Frank requires the Fed to draw up rules for better supervising the largest U.S. banks and other financial firms.  In his speech Tarullo also highlighted a section of the law that requires the Fed to consider the systemic risk implications of any mergers between financial firms.  The Fed’s contemplation of the Capital One-ING online banking merger is the first test of that provision.  Next week the Fed is set to hold a public hearing on the deal, which would create the seventh-largest U.S. bank, according to SNL Financial, a financial services data firm.  Tarullo laid out his interpretation of the Fed’s responsibilities when reviewing mergers, without specifically mentioning the Capital One deal, and noted that Dodd-Frank did not instruct the Fed to reject a deal simply because it would pose a greater risk to financial stability.  “Instead, it appears we have been instructed to add any increased systemic risk to the list of adverse effects that could result from the merger and then determine whether the benefits to the public of the acquisition outweigh these adverse effects,” Tarullo said.  Capital One has said the proposed ING online bank deal poses no systemic risk, and has noted that even after the deal the bank would be far smaller than the largest U.S. banks.  Big bank executives have fought back against calls to shrink large financial institutions. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, the second-largest U.S. bank, used his annual letter to shareholders last year to blast the “demonization” of large banks and corporations.  He said large companies such as Ford Motor Co, Boeing Co and Google Inc, and municipalities need banking partners with sufficiently large balance sheets to finance global transactions and offer a range of financial products.  In his speech, Tarullo did not discount the benefits large financial institutions can provide but suggested there is a limit.  “It is possible that a firm would need to be quite large and diversified to achieve these economies, but still not as large and diversified as some of today’s firms have become,” he said.  The Clearing House, which represents Bank of America, JPMorgan and other banks, plans to release a study next week promoting the benefits of large banks.  The study argues that large banks help the economy by offering products smaller institutions do not, fostering innovation in financial products and by achieving economies of scale that can make products cheaper, according to a copy of the executive summary obtained by Reuters.

71,COF,Fed's Tarullo questions benefits of big banks," * Tarullo says big-bank benefit needs to be studied more   * Tarullo outlines Fed’s policy on reviewing mergers   * Fed reviewing Capital One purchase of ING   By Dave Clarke   WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - A top Federal Reserve official on Thursday questioned the economic benefits of mega banks and other large financial companies.   Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said currently there is limited evidence to show that big financial firms produce “economies of scale” beyond services related to processing payments such as debit and credit card purchases.   Tarullo told a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve on Thursday that the issue needs to be further studied.   “Generally, though, even where intuition suggests economies in some other areas — such as the breadth of securities distribution networks and the ability to provide all forms of financing in significant amounts — evidence for the existence of such economies is limited and mixed,” he said.   Tarullo said the new regulatory regime laid out in last year’s Dodd-Frank financial oversight law only increases the importance of understanding “the social utility of the largest, most complex financial firms.”   Dodd-Frank requires the Fed to draw up rules for better supervising the largest U.S. banks and other financial firms.   In his speech Tarullo also highlighted a section of the law that requires the Fed to consider the systemic risk implications of any mergers between financial firms.   In a first test of that provision, the Fed is weighing whether to approve Capital One Financial Corp’s (COF.N) proposed acquisition of ING Groep NV’s ING.AS online bank ING Direct.   Next week the Fed is set to hold a public hearing on the deal, which would create the 7th-largest U.S. bank, according to SNL Financial, a financial services data firm.   Tarullo laid out his interpretation of the Fed’s responsibilities when reviewing mergers, without specifically mentioning the deal, and noted that Dodd-Frank did not instruct the Fed to reject a deal simply because it would pose a greater risk to financial stability.   “Instead, it appears we have been instructed to add any increased systemic risk to the list of adverse effects that could result from the merger and then determine whether the benefits to the public of the acquisition outweigh these adverse effects,” Tarullo said.   Some consumer groups have has pressured the Fed to closely scrutinize the systemic risk posed by the deal.   Capital One has said no such risk would result and have noted that even after the deal the bank would be far smaller then the largest U.S. banks.

73,COF,"Fed tested on ""too big to fail"" in merger review","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumer groups will try to convince the Federal Reserve this week that rubber stamping the Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) takeover of ING Groep NV’s ING.AS online banking unit would prove that “too big to fail” is alive and well.  The Fed is holding the first of three nationwide hearings on Tuesday on the $9 billion deal that observers are characterizing as a test case for how the U.S. government will view big-bank mergers after the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  During the crisis, U.S. taxpayers extended multibillion-dollar bailouts to large banks whose failure could have brought the financial system to its knees.  Last year’s Dodd-Frank financial oversight law did not force regulators to break up big banks, but instructed them to closely scrutinize future mergers.  Capital One stands to become the 7th-largest U.S. bank with more than $320 billion in assets if it acquires ING and HSBC Holding Plc’s (HSBA.L) U.S. credit card business, which it announced in August, according to SNL Financial.  “It is one thing for a $20 billion bank to fail. We’ll feel a ripple, there will be hand-wringing,” said John Taylor of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, who has led the charge against the merger and will testify in Washington on Tuesday. “When a $300 billion bank fails, that is a threat to our system.”  Tuesday will mark the Fed’s first public hearings on a merger since Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) acquired Countrywide in 2008.  Representative Barney Frank, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, last month said the deal needed a tough review and asked the Fed to hold public hearings.  “An important subject like this ought to be dealt with with as much chance for public input and as transparently as possible,” Frank said in an interview with Reuters.  Community groups are eager to weigh in.  “(The Fed has) signaled that ‘too big to fail’ is a very serious issue,” said Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate at Public Citizen’s Congress Watch division. “I hope they are shaken by their failure to prevent the financial crash.”  Dodd-Frank requires U.S. regulators to now take systemic risk into account when evaluating a merger, in addition to public benefit, concentration of resources, unfair competition and other factors.  McLean, Virginia-based Capital One gets over half of its revenue from credit cards and would access about $80 billion in deposits and 7 million new customers from ING.  Some industry experts say the deal could produce benefits.  Karen Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, said the merger would make Capital One less risky by diversifying the credit-card focused company and giving it more access to capital.  She also pointed out that the Dutch government — which bailed out ING in 2008 — told it to sell its U.S. portfolio.  “The only entities that can acquire so large a portfolio are big banks,” she said. “Size is not a good criterion of systemic risk.”  Some community groups will testify on Tuesday in support of the merger.  But Taylor says neither company has a good enough track record to be trusted with growing larger.  Capital One, “had to be bailed out, they are buying another bank that had to be bailed out even more and they have essentially a mono-line approach to banking, which means all their eggs are in one basket,” he said.  Capital One received a federal bailout of about $3.5 billion during the financial crisis, while ING received about 10 billion euros from the Dutch government.  Capital One has vigorously defended the merger. Last week, chief executive Richard Fairbank said the deal does not create enough systemic risk to warrant scrapping it.  “If you look at the criteria for systemic risk, the answer is no, no, no, no, no on the long-list of items,” Fairbank said at the Barclays Capital financial services conference in New York.  The Fed has signaled it will take a nuanced approach in its review.  In a speech on September 15, Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said the Fed will not automatically block mergers if they increase risk to the financial system.  “While Congress instructed us to consider the extent to which a proposed acquisition would pose a greater risk to financial stability, it clearly did not instruct us to reject an acquisition simply because there would be any increase in such risks,” he said at a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve.

76,COF,Community banks call for halt on big-bank mergers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A trade group representing U.S. community banks called on Tuesday for a moratorium on mergers involving financial firms with more than $100 billion in assets.  The Independent Community Bankers of America made its pitch to regulators at the first in a series of public hearings the Federal Reserve is holding to review Capital One Financial Corp’s proposed takeover of ING Groep NV’s U.S. online banking portfolio.  Chris Cole, senior vice president of ICBA, said there should be a moratorium on big-bank mergers until rules from last year’s Dodd-Frank financial oversight law are defined and in force.  “It has been 14 months since the Dodd-Frank Act was passed and we still don’t have a regulatory apparatus in place to deal with those banks over $50 billion in assets ... and haven’t figured out an accurate way to measure their systemic risk,” he said.  The Fed is reviewing Capital One’s $9 billion proposed merger, which would create the 7th-largest U.S. bank by assets, according to SNL Financial.  The markets are watching the review as a test case for how the U.S. government will treat big-bank mergers after the financial crisis.  Dodd-Frank requires U.S. regulators to take systemic risk into account when evaluating a merger, in addition to public benefit, concentration of resources, unfair competition and other factors.  Capital One defended the merger at the hearing, telling the Fed and community groups that big does not necessarily mean risky.  “Dodd-Frank is clear on a key point: There is no automatic finding of increased risk to our financial system in the event one institution acquires another, even if those institutions are relatively large,” said John Finneran, head of corporate reputation and general counsel for Capital One.  Finneran said the merger would actually minimize systemic risk, by giving Capital One — which derives more than half its revenue from credit cards — access to ING’s $80 billion in deposits.  He also pointed out that Capital One did not create or sell the exotic financial instruments — such as credit default swaps — that brought down many banks and spread financial ruin during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  The company, he added, would remain a traditional consumer and commercial bank “with none of the complexity or interconnectivity that the Dodd-Frank Act sought to address in ending the concept of ‘too big to fail.’”  But that very simplicity could leave Capital One vulnerable in an economic downturn, according to John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an advocacy group that has pushed hard against the merger.  “This is an unsafe, monoline business that relies on a highly sensitive single-source of income and then spreads three quarters of its risk to the public through selling its securities to America’s retirement funds and insurance companies,” he told the Fed representatives. “And they are asking you to allow them to become the nation’s fifth-largest bank” by deposits.  Cole from ICBA said the Fed should not approve any big mergers until large banks have submitted to regulators “living wills” to serve as blueprints for their dismantling in the event of failure, among other reforms not yet put in place.  The largest banks are expected to start submitting their living wills to regulators by the middle of next year.  Cole also suggested that banking agencies issue special rules explaining systemic risk in the context of mergers and acquisitions.  Fed representatives at the hearing appeared skeptical of a moratorium, questioning Cole about the economic impact of such a move.

80,COF,Capital One says its credit card focus is safe,"(Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp hit back on Tuesday at charges that its proposed takeover of ING Groep NV’s U.S. online banking unit will help lay the groundwork for the next financial crisis.  Consumer advocates are arguing that Capital One’s $9 billion purchase would allow it to supercharge its credit card portfolio. They are drawing parallels to the subprime mortgage boom that led to the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  John Finneran, general counsel for Capital One, told the Federal Reserve at a public hearing in Chicago that the bank’s credit card focus would not pose a risk to the financial system.  “The credit card market is substantially smaller, far less complex and far less impactful on the broader economy,” Finneran said.  Capital One is facing tough scrutiny for its proposed merger that would create the 7th largest U.S. bank by assets, according to SNL Financial.  Many are watching the regulatory review as a test case of how the Federal Reserve will treat large bank mergers after the market crisis forced taxpayers to bail out large financial firms.  McLean, Virginia-based Capital One gets over half of its revenue from credit cards and would access about $80 billion in deposits and 7 million new customers from ING.  But Finneran noted that securitization accounts for less than 20 percent of the company’s total funding and noted that the card portfolio shrunk by $17 billion or 25 percent since 2008.  “This product diversification, combined with our conservative and industry-leading underwriting capabilities, helped make us one of only two credit card businesses not to lose money in any quarter during the Great Recession,” he said.  The Fed announced the hearings after Democratic Representative Barney Frank wrote a letter urging more scrutiny of the merger. Frank is one of the co-authors of last year’s Dodd-Frank oversight law that aims to get rid of the notion that some financial firms are “too big to fail.”  Many community leaders want the deal blocked and dispute Finneran’s claims that Capital One’s credit card focus poses no risk.  “By saying yes to this deal, the Federal Reserve will likely enable Capital One to account for more than 32 percent of all outstanding credit card securities in the (asset-backed securities) market,” said James Carr, chief business officer of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which has led the charge against the deal.  “Like the predatory and toxic subprime mortgages that eventually imploded — taking the entire financial system with it — Capital One’s credit-card business is poised to become the next subprime lending crisis for America,” Carr said.  Dodd-Frank requires U.S. regulators to take systemic risk into account when evaluating a merger, in addition to public benefit, concentration of resources, unfair competition and other factors.  Reverend Jesse Jackson echoed Carr, drawing a parallel with Bank of America Corp’s 2008 acquisition of Countrywide, which is faulted for that bank’s severe subprime mortgage losses.  “Like Countrywide, Capital One is pursuing a risky business model, where more than 75 percent of its profits come from a single source: credit cards,” said Jackson.  The main difference, he added, is that Capital One’s “poison pill” is credit cards, not subprime mortgages.  Capital One announced on Monday it would create 500 new jobs in Delaware, where ING has its U.S. headquarters, by 2013 if the merger went through. In exchange, Capital One would receive $5.6 million from the state and a rebate of up to $1.5 million for local capital expenditures. The incentives would have to be approved by a state panel.  Capital One’s Finneran told the Fed his company’s job growth plans were “a rare bright spot” amid the tens of thousands of layoffs recently announced by banks across the country.  The company has also promised to make $180 billion in new community-development loans and investments over the next 10 years, and touted its small business loans and affordable housing initiatives.  Critics have accused the company of failing to extend Federal Housing Administration-insured loans to people with lower but agency-accepted credit scores, and steering borrowers to subprime credit cards instead of traditional loans.

81,COF,UPDATE 2-Capital One says its credit card focus is safe," * Critics say Capital One too focused on credit cards   * Capital One says ING deal has benefits, no big risks   * Fed review of merger seen as “too big to fail” test  (Adds details on hearing, background)   By Alexandra Alper   Sept 27 (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) hit back on Tuesday at charges that its proposed takeover of ING Groep NV’s U.S. online banking unit will help lay the groundwork for the next financial crisis.   Consumer advocates are arguing that Capital One’s $9 billion purchase would allow it to supercharge its credit card portfolio. They are drawing parallels to the subprime mortgage boom that led to the 2007-2009 financial crisis.   John Finneran, general counsel for Capital One, told the Federal Reserve at a public hearing in Chicago that the bank’s credit card focus would not pose a risk to the financial system.   “The credit card market is substantially smaller, far less complex and far less impactful on the broader economy,” Finneran said.   Capital One is facing tough scrutiny for its proposed merger that would create the 7th largest U.S. bank by assets, according to SNL Financial.   Many are watching the regulatory review as a test case of how the Federal Reserve will treat large bank mergers after the market crisis forced taxpayers to bail out large financial firms.   McLean, Virginia-based Capital One gets over half of its revenue from credit cards and would access about $80 billion in deposits and 7 million new customers from ING.   But Finneran noted that securitization accounts for less than 20 percent of the company’s total funding and noted that the card portfolio shrunk by $17 billion or 25 percent since 2008.   “This product diversification, combined with our conservative and industry-leading underwriting capabilities, helped make us one of only two credit card businesses not to lose money in any quarter during the Great Recession,” he said.   The Fed announced the hearings after Democratic Representative Barney Frank wrote a letter urging more scrutiny of the merger. Frank is one of the co-authors of last year’s Dodd-Frank oversight law that aims to get rid of the notion that some financial firms are “too big to fail.”   Many community leaders want the deal blocked and dispute Finneran’s claims that Capital One’s credit card focus poses no risk.   “By saying yes to this deal, the Federal Reserve will likely enable Capital One to account for more than 32 percent of all outstanding credit card securities in the (asset-backed securities) market,” said James Carr, chief business officer of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which has led the charge against the deal.   “Like the predatory and toxic subprime mortgages that eventually imploded — taking the entire financial system with it — Capital One’s credit-card business is poised to become the next subprime lending crisis for America,” Carr said.   Dodd-Frank requires U.S. regulators to take systemic risk into account when evaluating a merger, in addition to public benefit, concentration of resources, unfair competition and other factors.   Reverend Jesse Jackson echoed Carr, drawing a parallel with Bank of America Corp’s 2008 acquisition of Countrywide, which is faulted for that bank’s severe subprime mortgage losses.   “Like Countrywide, Capital One is pursuing a risky business model, where more than 75 percent of its profits come from a single source: credit cards,” said Jackson.   The main difference, he added, is that Capital One’s “poison pill” is credit cards, not subprime mortgages.   Capital One announced on Monday it would create 500 new jobs in Delaware, where ING has its U.S. headquarters, by 2013 if the merger went through. In exchange, Capital One would receive $5.6 million from the state and a rebate of up to $1.5 million for local capital expenditures. The incentives would have to be approved by a state panel.   Capital One’s Finneran told the Fed his company’s job growth plans were “a rare bright spot” amid the tens of thousands of layoffs recently announced by banks across the country.   The company has also promised to make $180 billion in new community-development loans and investments over the next 10 years, and touted its small business loans and affordable housing initiatives.   Critics have accused the company of failing to extend Federal Housing Administration-insured loans to people with lower but agency-accepted credit scores, and steering borrowers to subprime credit cards instead of traditional loans.

83,COF,"E*Trade to boost sales force, focus on retirement","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online broker E*Trade Financial plans to double its sales force over the next couple of years to 400 from 200 as it seeks to increase its share of client assets in the investment retirement sector, the firm’s chief financial officer, Matthew Audette, said on Monday.  E*Trade, which recently initiated a strategic review at the insistence of its biggest shareholder, hedge fund Citadel LLC, that could result in the sale of the company, returned to profitability this year after losing billions over a period of several years from bad mortgages in its banking unit.  The New York-based firm’s shares have lost more than half their value, closing at $8.36 on Monday, since hitting a 52-week high of $18.13 in February as markets have deteriorated, expectations for interest rate increases have been pushed further into the future, and many market watchers have expressed doubt that the firm will find a buyer.  “Our focus isn’t on the short term movements of the stock, it’s maximizing shareholder value,” Audette said at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit.  He would not comment directly on the strategic review other than to say it would go on for “as long as it takes.”  Charles Schwab Corp and TD Ameritrade have been touted as possible buyers of E*Trade, but both have said a deal could be complicated due to the risky assets in the firm’s mortgage portfolio. Capital One Financial Corp has also been mentioned as a possible buyer.  Audette pointed out that delinquencies and provisions for losses on bad loans are down, which are the key indicators to future loan losses.  The lower loan losses helped E*Trade earn around $100 million in the first half of 2011, and Audette said that the firm was focused on building on that momentum.  One way it plans to do so is by tapping into its existing client base to sell more products, which is where increasing its sales force comes in.  “Our customers broadly have around $200 billion of assets with us,” Audette said. “It’s about a 12 percent wallet share for our customer base, meaning $1.7 trillion to $1.8 trillion in assets, so we think that is a large opportunity as we double our sales force and highlight to them and educate them about our products and services.”  Key among those products are mutual fund and exchange-traded funds used in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) for self-directed investing for retirement.  Audette said E*Trade also aims to increase its industry-leading 20 percent market share in the corporate services area — facilitating companies that offer restricted stock and options to other firms — as well as improving and attracting new clients to its online platform.

84,COF,Bankers strike dour note on U.S. bank M&A;,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investment bankers, traditionally an optimistic lot, struck a dour note on bank deals in the near future, describing their outlook with words rarely heard spoken publicly in these circles — “bleak,” “skeptical,” “really quiet.”  Volatile markets, sinking bank stocks, and an uncertain regulatory and economic environment have brought bank deals to a grinding halt at a time when the need for mergers is great, financial services bankers and lawyers said on Tuesday.  “Our current read of activity is that it’s really quiet,” said Fernando Rivas, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s (JPM.N) co-head of North America financial institutions group, speaking at the SNL Bank M&A Symposium in New York.  Andrew Senchak, KBW Inc’s KBW.N co-head of global financial institutions group, added: “I offer a pretty bleak assessment until certain aspects of the political reality get resolved.”  The downbeat sentiment comes after a somewhat better start to 2011. The first half of the year saw a handful of large transactions such as Capital One Financial Corp’s (COF.N) $9 billion deal to buy ING Groep’s ING.AS U.S. online bank, and PNC Financial Services Group Inc’s (PNC.N) $3.6 billion purchase of Royal Bank of Canada’s (RY.TO) U.S. retail bank operations.  U.S. M&A involving banks has totaled $29.2 billion so far this year, more than double the $11.5 billion at the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.  But these numbers are still far below the activity seen in previous years. In 2007, for example, the U.S. banking sector saw $68.8 billion worth of deals for the entire year, the data shows.  Things could get worse. The U.S. Federal Reserve is examining Capital One’s bid for ING Direct USA in a move that observers are characterizing as a test case for how the U.S. government will view big-bank mergers.  Some other banks are seeing that decision as a warning that such transactions will be subject to more scrutiny.  “If the CapOne application were denied that warning shot would become a nuclear weapon against acquisitions,” said Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman of law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, which was one of the advisers on the deal.  Deals are not only important for investment bankers and their firms, but they can also help weed out some of the zombie institutions that are stumbling along but making few new loans.  M&A, however, is only one part of fixing a banking system that has many broken parts. A lot ails banks these days.  A low interest rate environment is squeezing profitability, a weak economy is hurting loan demand, regulation is curtailing sources of revenue such as fees, increased capital requirements are slashing returns, and compliance costs are going up.  The KBW Banks index .BKX has fallen some 28 percent since August. Bankers said they expected bank earnings to fall further as these pressures play out.  Deal advisers said the need for bank M&A had never been greater. Mergers can help banks cut costs and grow.  “There is no need to follow a Noah’s Ark approach in a merger and having two of everything,” said Cohen, a long-time adviser to some of the largest banks.  “There can often be a chance to increase revenues if the acquirers products and services are superior to those of the target,” he said.  In the near term deals are likely to involve pools of assets to drive balance sheet growth and mergers with low takeover premiums, bankers said.  One bright spot for deal advisers is the low end of the spectrum, where community banks are weighing M&A as they grapple with problems such as board fatigue, access to capital and lack of earnings visibility.  “This is the ground from which M&A activity will spring over the foreseeable future,” said Brian Sterling, co-head of investment banking at Sandler O’Neill Partners.

86,COF,Insight: Chase's card chief rebuilds business part by part,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gordon Smith, credit card chief of JPMorgan Chase, often spends his weekends at his northern New Jersey home, rebuilding the engines of vintage cars.  As he takes apart an engine, he puts pieces in plastic Ziploc bags to keep track of where they belong. He videotapes the disassembly, in case he forgets how to rebuild.  “It would be really embarrassing to take a pile of pieces back to the shop and say, ‘I took it apart. I’m an office worker. Could you put it back together for me?” Smith quipped in an English accent in a recent interview.  Smith is using that same careful approach to rebuild Chase’s credit card unit. And the model he is using resembles that of American Express Co.  Smith, who joined Chase in 2007 after 26 years at American Express, took over operations of a travel agency in JPMorgan’s private equity unit, allowing him to offer better travel rewards and a better corporate card.  He built up the bank’s Paymentech unit, which processes card transactions for merchants. He created the Sapphire card for wealthier customers whose big spending earns him more processing fees.  Smith is also applying several lessons taken from the consumer finance industry’s playbook: improving customer service, combining many rewards programs into one and shedding cards that are not profitable enough. Along the way, he is spending hundreds of millions of dollars mailing card offers.  Step back and look at what Smith is building, and it looks a lot like American Express: a business that caters to rich clients and relies increasingly on processing fees to make money.  That has made American Express the most consistently profitable of the major financial services companies, outpacing more glamorous businesses like Goldman Sachs Group Inc in recent years in return on equity. (Please see graph: link.reuters.com/bym24s )  There’s big risk in this strategy for Smith, though, and at stake is more than his 1969 Jaguar XK-E or his 1972 Triumph TR6. Credit card companies have tried to follow American Express’s strategy for years and have failed.  Chase starts with some big disadvantages. Although its Paymentech processes transactions for merchants, it does not run the Visa or Mastercard global networks that accept its cards and influence how much it can charge for credit card transactions.  American Express runs its own network, which allows it to charge merchants a higher price for delivering wealthy clients. American Express can earn more on transactions than Chase.  But Chase’s credit card business is second in size only to American Express’s, and contributed 12 percent of JPMorgan’s $17.4 billion of profits last year. If Smith pulls off the transformation, the rewards could be handsome.  Some analysts believe he is among a small group of potential successors to Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, even though the 53-year-old Smith is just 2-1/2 years younger than Dimon, 55.  “Smith would do well with even larger responsibilities in the company. He’s a very talented executive,” said Moshe Orenbuch, a veteran industry analyst at Credit Suisse.  Jamie Dimon in an interview said Smith is “an extraordinary executive on multiple levels.”  Dimon has given Smith more responsibility in recent months, including oversight of JPMorgan’s auto finance and student lending business, and responsibility for marketing the Chase retail banking brand and shaping up Chase’s information networks.  Smith is making progress. Profits have recovered under his watch. He’s improved the bank’s customer service rankings for credit cards, and he is getting ahead of competitors who also issue MasterCard and Visa cards.  “Chase is taking share of big spenders who previously had loyalty to other issuers,” said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, which publishes news and research on consumer payment systems.  Robertson says that since Smith arrived, Chase seized 1.15 percentage points of market share while Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc each lost more than one point.  Boosting market share in consumer finance businesses is usually a game of inches.  “That is a huge change,” Dimon said.  Smith, who grew up in the quiet coastal town of Peacehaven in southeast England, says he owes some of his success to his training as a computer programer, which taught him to focus on details as well as the broader picture.  “When you are doing systems work, you have to take a high-level view of what you want to do, and you have to turn it into lines of code that will actually do something,” said Smith, whose first job at American Express was programing.  Smith is doing some heavy rewriting of Chase’s code after expenses for losses on card balances reached an astounding $18.5 billion in 2009.  That coupled with a grim outlook for lending spurred Smith to scale down risk by extending less credit to customers who carry more than $20,000 of debt on all their cards. Within two years, balances of such higher-risk customers were down by 40 percent.  He has also cut card loans outstanding by 20 percent to $125.6 billion in June from $157 billion at the end of 2007.  Smith still likes interest income when he can get it safely. He created a product he calls Blueprint, an online budgeting program to support customers who will occasionally use their cards to borrow, with plans to pay back what they owe.  As he reduces credit risk, he is boosting profits by processing transactions, a move that Dimon supports.  Every time a customer spends on a credit card, the bank that issues the card earns, on average, about 1.75 percentage points of the transaction as a fee, according to Credit Suisse’s Orenbuch.  In Smith’s most-recently reported quarter, the take helped push his fee revenue to nearly 40 percent as much as his interest income, nearly twice the proportion as in 2007.  And now that Chase is making fewer dubious loans that require big loss provisions, Smith’s bottom line is rising again. Return on equity in the unit rose to 35 percent in the first half of this year from 1 percent in the first half of 2010. The company has told analysts to generally expect 20 percent returns on equity.  The first half of 2011 may be unusually high for return on equity because the firm’s delinquencies fell precipitously.  Every morning at 9 a.m., Smith has some 500 managers on a conference call for 30 minutes to review calls from customers.  They receive basic information about a client or two, listen to the interactions and discuss how the process could have gone better.  Smith pushes his staff to recognize what he calls customer “moments of truth,” experiences that define how cardholders think about Chase.  One is when someone loses a card and needs a replacement immediately. (Smith has a team to get new cards to remote locations.) Another is when suspicious charges appear on accounts and must be discussed.  One lesson Smith and his executives have taken from these calls is how much customers hate to be transferred.  “You hear the tone from the customer drop when that happens,” Smith said. “As soon as you get to that first transfer, customer satisfaction begins to drop, even though the problem gets resolved.”  His response: train representatives to solve more problems themselves. It’s a logical answer, but not an easy task given that Chase has 12,000 people taking calls and answering mail.  Chase’s standing with customers improved more than that of the industry last year, said Michael Beird, director of banking services for research firm J.D. Power.  But Smith needs a lot of those kinds of fixes to make more progress in customer service and loyalty for Chase, particularly with competitors trying to improve their game.  Chase ranks only about average in credit card customer satisfaction, behind top-ranked American Express and the slightly lower-ranked Discover Financial Services, according to J.D. Power.  Smith, said Nilson’s Robertson, is trying to create something many people doubt can exist: good service from a big bank.  Smith has been spending a lot of money on marketing and the bank’s rewards program. Since 2008, the bank’s annual spending on marketing has risen nearly 40 percent.  The unit’s overhead, including marketing expenses, reached 41 percent of revenue at the end of the quarter in June, up from 31 percent in 2008.  He increased marketing spending at the end of 2009 when he rolled out his new products with mailings and broadcast advertising. The new products included the Sapphire Card, the INK card for small businesses and other card accounts with new rewards programs.  Chase has pushed the industry to send out more mail for new accounts and aggressively offer customers cash back for their rewards points. He has promoted additional perks, such as the transferring rewards to airline frequent-flyer accounts, point-for-point.  That has raised concerns among stock analysts about how far industry-wide spending and price-cutting might go.  “Chase has really kick-started the mailbox,” said Andrew Davidson, senior vice president of research firm Mintel Comperemedia.  In the second quarter of this year, card companies sent nearly 1.3 billion new account offers to U.S. addresses, up from about 850 million a year earlier, said Davidson.  Citibank this year has followed Chase’s lead and now the two banks are responsible for most of the mail, said Davidson.  Cardholder spending on new Chase accounts came in 53 percent higher in the last quarter of 2010 compared with a year before. Now Smith has to make sure he holds onto those gains to get the real payoff from all his spending.  Dimon says he is confident in the investments.  “In the recession, Gordon and I saw eye-to-eye,” Dimon said. “We are going to run this company for the future ... and we had lost so much money, nobody is going to notice an extra couple of hundred million dollars.”  Every credit card company from Capital One Financial Corp to Bank of America to Citigroup wants wealthy clients because they are a low credit risk and they spend a lot.  Companies try to woo them with lagniappes galore: rewards programs, sign-up bonuses and so on. The strategy is easy to conceive, but hard to execute profitably.  Bank of America invented what is now the Visa card in the late 1950’s as a replacement for the credit that local drugstores and grocers offered their customers.  For most banks, lending through credit cards is in their DNA, but with weak demand, it’s not the source of profits it used to be.  “People have been nipping at American Express’s heels for a decade, off and on,” said Brad Ball, an analyst at investment bank Evercore. “Some have been somewhat successful, but arguably American Express is a premium product with a premium customer and a premium brand, so they can have premium pricing.”  Smith over time can make his business look more like American Express’s, but without a network, he may never be able to fully duplicate it, analysts said.  He has considered purchasing or building one, but the only network that any company could realistically buy, namely Discover Financial Services, is not as globally available as Visa and Mastercard.  Clients care most about their cards being accepted in as many places as possible, Smith said. “We obviously think about these things a lot, but that would really be the challenge, and it would be a tough one.” (Reporting by David Henry and Dan Wilchins in New York.

87,COF,"E*Trade to boost sales force, focus on retirement","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online broker E*Trade Financial plans to double its sales force over the next couple of years to 400 from 200 as it seeks to increase its share of client assets in the investment retirement sector, the firm’s chief financial officer, Matthew Audette, said on Monday.  E*Trade, which recently initiated a strategic review at the insistence of its biggest shareholder, hedge fund Citadel LLC, that could result in the sale of the company, returned to profitability this year after losing billions over a period of several years from bad mortgages in its banking unit.  The New York-based firm’s shares have lost more than half their value, closing at $8.36 on Monday, since hitting a 52-week high of $18.13 in February as markets have deteriorated, expectations for interest rate increases have been pushed further into the future, and many market watchers have expressed doubt that the firm will find a buyer.  “Our focus isn’t on the short term movements of the stock, it’s maximizing shareholder value,” Audette said at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit.  He would not comment directly on the strategic review other than to say it would go on for “as long as it takes.”  Charles Schwab Corp and TD Ameritrade have been touted as possible buyers of E*Trade, but both have said a deal could be complicated due to the risky assets in the firm’s mortgage portfolio. Capital One Financial Corp has also been mentioned as a possible buyer.  Audette pointed out that delinquencies and provisions for losses on bad loans are down, which are the key indicators to future loan losses.  The lower loan losses helped E*Trade earn around $100 million in the first half of 2011, and Audette said that the firm was focused on building on that momentum.  One way it plans to do so is by tapping into its existing client base to sell more products, which is where increasing its sales force comes in.  “Our customers broadly have around $200 billion of assets with us,” Audette said. “It’s about a 12 percent wallet share for our customer base, meaning $1.7 trillion to $1.8 trillion in assets, so we think that is a large opportunity as we double our sales force and highlight to them and educate them about our products and services.”  Key among those products are mutual fund and exchange-traded funds used in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) for self-directed investing for retirement.  Audette said E*Trade also aims to increase its industry-leading 20 percent market share in the corporate services area — facilitating companies that offer restricted stock and options to other firms — as well as improving and attracting new clients to its online platform.

89,COF,UPDATE 3-Capital One Q3 profit rises on net interest income,"* EPS of $1.77 vs. $1.76 a year ago * Street view of $1.68 * Loan losses fall, net interest income rises in Q3 By Joe Rauch Oct 20 (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp  reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as net interest income rose and the bank set aside less money for loan losses. McLean, Virginia-based Capital One’s commercial loans grew faster than its credit card and consumer loans during the quarter. The results highlight the growing role other borrowers have at the bank as part of a transformation begun before the 2008 financial crisis. Total commercial loans increased 8 percent, while consumer and credit card loans both rose roughly 1 percent. “They’re still a very card focused company, but ancillary growth in other parts of the business is welcome in this kind of environment,” said Jason Arnold, financial services analyst with RBC Capital Markets. In June, Capital One announced a $9 billion proposed purchase of ING Groep NV’s U.S. online bank operations as the latest step in that transformation. Yet credit cards will continue to play a key role going forward. The portfolio is the largest with $62 billion in loans and the bank announced plans to buy HSBC Holdings Plc’s U.S. credit card operations, totaling $30 billion in credit card loans. Unlike many other U.S. banks, Capital One’s net interest margin — or the difference in interest it receives on loans compared to what it pays on deposits — rose during the quarter to 7.39 percent from 7.21 percent. As a result, net interest income increased 5.5 percent to $3.28 billion. Capital One reported third-quarter net income of $813 million, or $1.77 per share, up from $803 million, or $1.76 per share, a year ago. Analysts on average had projected the bank would earn $1.68 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenues rose 3.4 percent to $4.15 billion from $4 billion a year ago. The loan growth during the quarter was paired with fewer problem loans. Capital One’s charge-off rate for loans declined to 2.92 percent from 4.82 percent a year ago and the provision for loan and lease losses dropped 28 percent to $622 million from $867 million. But non-interest expenses also rose during the quarter, increasing 15 percent to $2.3 billion from $2 billion. In June, Capital One announced plans to buy ING Direct, the Dutch financial company’s U.S. online bank operations, in a deal that would leapfrog the bank into one of the largest domestic banks by deposits. But the deal has come under fire from Washington lawmakers and consumer advocates, who argue it would create another too-big-to-fail bank, and regulators are closely scrutinizing the deal. Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank said the bank plans to complete the deal by the end of 2011 or early 2012. Fairbank also said the bank would complete its purchase of HSBC’s U.S. credit card portfolio in the second quarter of 2012. He said regulators are scrutinizing the credit card portfolio purchase “as if we were acquiring a bank.” Capital One shares closed up nearly 1.9 percent on Thursday at $40.49 before results were announced. Capital One shares have declined 6.6 percent this year, a smaller drop than other bank and credit card stocks have posted this year amid a broad financial industry sell-off.",10202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/capital-one/update-3-capital-one-q3-profit-rises-on-net-interest-income-idUSN1E79J1RM20111020

92,COF,US regulator reopens comment on Cap One/HSBC deal,"Nov 21 (Reuters) - A U.S. banking regulator slowed Capital One Financial’s growth plans on Monday when it announced it would reopen the comment period for the bank’s takeover of HSBC’s U.S. credit card business. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency gave the public until Dec. 19 to comment on the $2.6 billion deal. Consumer groups say acquiring HSBC’s $30 billion credit card portfolio would only deepen Capital One’s “monoline” focus on credit cards, posing a risk to the financial system. “I don’t think anybody at the OCC wants to have their name all over the approval of an application that is followed a year or two later by the fifth largest bank (by assets) failing because the credit card market crashes,” said John Taylor, President of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which has led the charge against the bank’s expansion. The NCRC and 19 other consumer groups asked the OCC to hold hearings and extend the comment period in a letter on Nov. 8, a day after the original comment period closed. Capital One, which announced the HSBC deal in August, says its expansion will prove beneficial. “Our history clearly demonstrates that our customers and local communities will see numerous benefits from this acquisition,” Tatiana Snead, a spokeswoman for Capital One said via email. “We appreciate the OCC providing an additional opportunity for any interested parties to express their views.” The OCC’s move comes less than two months after the Federal Reserve held a series of hearings on Capital One’s proposed $9 billion takeover of ING Groep’s U.S. online banking unit. The Fed reopened the comment period on that deal, a week after Representative Barney Frank’s wrote to the central bank urging more scrutiny. Neither regulator has indicated when it will make a decision on Capital One’s proposed acquisitions. Many view Capital One’s expansion as a test case for how the U.S. government will treat big-bank mergers following the financial crisis. Last year’s Dodd-Frank law requires U.S. regulators to take systemic risk into account when evaluating a merger, in addition to public benefit, concentration of resources, unfair competition and other factors.",11212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/financial-regulation-capitalone/us-regulator-reopens-comment-on-cap-one-hsbc-deal-idUSN1E7AK1Z420111121

Capital One announced plans last year to buy online deposit-taker ING Direct for $8.9 billion in the biggest U.S. bank acquisition since Congress passed the Dodd-Frank financial oversight law in July 2010. The deal has generated concern from consumer groups who have argued it would create another “too big to fail” bank, even as regulators try to create a financial system less likely to need taxpayer bailouts in response to the 2007-2009 crisis. The Federal Reserve said in a posting on its website on Monday that it would consider the merger application on Wednesday and that a “final announcement” would follow the closed meeting. John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which has led the charge against the merger, warned of dire consequences in an interview if the Fed approves the deal that Capital One says will make it fifth-largest by deposits. “God help the Federal Reserve and, more importantly, God help the country if the fifth largest bank in the country fails..,” he said. “God knows what contagion effect it would have on other banks.” Capital One wants to buy the ING business for its deposits, which can be used to fund more loans, and to expand its customer base.  Executive said last month they expected to close the deal by the end of March and also complete the purchase of the U.S. credit card portfolio of British banking giant HSBC Holdings Plc  by the end of June. “We look forward to receiving approval and closing our transaction in 1Q 2012,” Tatiana Stead, a spokeswoman for Capital One, said on Monday. The company recently hired more people and increased spending to prepare for the new customers to come with the deals.  The increased spending pushed net income down 42 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, which triggered a 5 percent one-day drop in the company’s stock on Jan. 20. The acquisition, combined with the bank’s bid to take over HSBC’s (HSBA.L) US credit card business, would make Capital One the seventh largest U.S. bank by assets, as of the end of the third quarter of 2011, according to SNL Financial. Capital One announced its acquisition of ING in June, generating a hailstorm of opposition, including a letter from   Representative Barney Frank, co-author of Dodd-Frank, urging the Fed to scrutinize the deal. The Fed responded by announcing the first public hearings on a bank merger since Bank of America(BAC.N) acquired Countrywide in 2008. The central bank is required by the Dodd-Frank law to assess the risk a merger poses to the economy. In three nationwide hearings last year, consumer groups slammed what they described as the bank’s excessive focus on risky credit card debt, arguing the bank could destabilize the financial system or require a bailout if the debt goes sour. They also accused the company of failing to extend Federal Housing Administration-insured loans to people with lower but agency-accepted credit scores, and steering borrowers to subprime credit cards instead of traditional loans. Capital One has hit back with promises to boost hiring and community investment, painting itself as a consumer lender far removed from the Wall Street excesses that prompted the  financial crisis.",2062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/capitalone-ing-federalreserve/update-1-u-s-fed-to-meet-this-week-on-capital-one-ing-deal-idUSL2E8D6FPW20120206

Capital One in August announced its plan to acquire HSBC’s U.S. credit card portfolio in a $2.6 billion deal. Consumer groups have been critical of Capital One’s growth plans arguing that it has a spotty record in how it treats low-income customers and that the acquisitions will create another “too big to fail” bank. Capital One has defended its record and highlighted the benefits the acquisitions will bring to new and existing customers. Both the Fed and the OCC, which regulates national banks, extended initial comment periods on the deals in response to consumer advocates’ requests to solicit more feedback.

The lender has spent much of the past decade transforming itself from a specialty credit card lender dependent on bond market funding into a bank that relies on deposits. Even as Capital One bought online deposit taker ING Direct, making it the fifth-largest U.S. bank by deposits, it also bulked up its credit card division with a deal to buy HSBC’s  domestic business, totaling $30 billion in credit card loans. On a post-earnings conference call, Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said the deal, which is slated to close in the second quarter, would hurt results. “We expect second-quarter results to reflect a significant build in allowance and finance charges, and fee reserve as we bring the HSBC Domestic Card loans onto our balance sheet,” Fairbank said. The deal will also reduce its Tier 1 common equity ratio — a common measure of bank stability — to 9 percent in the current quarter from more than 11 percent in the first quarter. The company also expects its charge off rate — the percentage of loans that will likely never be repaid — to rise in the fourth quarter as a result of the deal. But the negative earnings impact will likely be short-lived. The company expects the deal to be “capital generative” in the third quarter. Fairbank said on a conference call the company had set aside $75 million to make refunds to credit card customers who had bought some products over the phone from sales people “who did not adhere to our scripts and sales policies.” “We are reaching out to all the customers who purchased these products over the past couple of years and offering a refund,” Fairbank said. The CEO did not say what the products were or what was said in the sales pitches. Capital One spokespersons did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment. Capital One’s focus on consumer lending has been paying off. The company’s $9 billion buy of ING Direct contributed to the doubling of its total consumer banking loan balances. Almost all its lending businesses grew in the first quarter. Period-end domestic card balances rose 5 percent to $53.17 billion. As the U.S. economy begins to add jobs and gain strength, consumers have become more comfortable swiping their cards and borrowing money. On Wednesday, credit card giant American Express also posted a higher profit on customer spending, signalling greater consumer confidence in the U.S. economy. “Our domestic card business continued to grow and gain market share in new accounts booked,” Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said on a post-earnings conference call. Including a purchase gain related to the ING Direct deal, the company earned $1.4 billion, or  $2.72 a share, compared with $1.0 billion, or $2.21 a share, a year ago. Excluding the gain, the company $1.56 per share, which topped analyst estimates of a profit of $1.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating costs at the McLean, Virginia-based lender rose 16 percent to $2.18 billion, partly due to merger-related expenses. Capital One’s shares were up 2 percent at $55.14 in extended trade.

120,COF,TEXT-Fitch comments on Capital One Financial,"April 20 - Capital One Financial’s (COF) first quarter 2012 	 (1Q’12) earnings benefited from the company’s recently closed acquisition of ING	 Direct, according to Fitch Ratings.  Excluding the effects of the ING Direct 	 deal, COF’s 1Q’12 earnings were $868 million, up from $407 million in 4Q’11, but	 down slightly from $1 billion in 1Q’11.  Fitch views COF’s operating earnings as	 good.	 	 The biggest driver of COF’s earnings was largely due to higher revenue, both 	 including the ING Direct acquisition and from growth in the company’s legacy 	 businesses.  Overall revenue expanded 22% from the sequential quarter due to 	 $40.4 billion of loans attributable to the ING Direct acquisition which helped 	 boost COF’s net interest income for the quarter.  	 	 Even excluding this impact, however, COF’s total revenue from its legacy 	 portfolio grew 5.2% from the sequential quarter thanks to strong growth in auto 	 loans as well as strong auto finance originations during the quarter.  Fitch 	 notes that auto lending continues to be a strong area of growth for COF.	 	 COF’s 1Q’12 net interest margin (NIM) declined to 6.20% from 7.22% in 4Q’11.  	 This was due to the inclusion of ING Direct’s lower yielding assets onto the 	 balance sheet, as well as higher cash balances from COF’s capital raising 	 activities towards the end of the quarter.  	 	 As the ING Direct assets begin to run-off, and COF brings additional higher 	 yielding card loans onto the balance from the closing of the HSBC card 	 acquisition at some point in 2Q’12, Fitch would expect COF’s overall NIM to 	 expand in 2012.	 	 While these results were generally positive, Fitch does note that COF continues 	 to increase its reserve for mortgage representation and warranty claims.  The 	 company provisioned an additional $169 million for these claims in 1Q’12, which 	 brought the total reserve to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2012.  Fitch expects this	 to continue to be a drag on earnings in 2012.	 	 Fitch notes that COF’s credit quality metrics continue to be good.  Overall net 	 charge-offs (NCOs) during the quarter were 2.04%, down from 2.69% in 4Q’11.  	 Additionally, 30+ day delinquency rates declined in both the card and consumer 	 banking segments.  Overall non-performing assets (NPAs) have also remained good,	 though Fitch would note there was a very modest uptick in NPAs in the commercial	 banking segment, primarily related to commercial real estate loans.  	 Nonetheless, the total level of NPAs remains very manageable, in Fitch’s 	 opinion.	 	 As COF prepares to close its acquisition of the HSBC credit card portfolio in 	 2Q’12, in late 1Q’12 COF raised $1.25 billion of common stock as well as $1.25 	 billion of senior unsecured debt at the holding company.  These actions, as well	 as strong retained earnings growth, boosted COF’s Tier 1 common ratio to a solid	 11.9% at 1Q’12.",4202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA546720120420

The settlement would resolve lawsuits brought on behalf of more than 1 million people over the fees, which are assessed when customers overdraw their checking accounts by using their debit cards. Consumers accused more than 30 lenders of trying to boost overdraft fees, which are typically $25 to $35, by reordering transactions from largest to smallest rather than processing them in chronological order. This can cause fees to be incurred sooner and more often because account balances fall more quickly. Roughly one-third of the lenders have settled. Several others have agreed to mediation. On Friday, lawyers for Capital One Financial Corp  and the plaintiffs said efforts to mediate their dispute had failed, and that court proceedings that had been put on hold pending the mediation will resume. In a order dated Thursday, U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King in Miami, who oversees the nationwide litigation, called the JPMorgan settlement fair, reasonable and adequate, and certified a class of plaintiffs. Customers may opt out of the settlement. A final hearing is scheduled for Dec. 10. Bank of America Corp’s $410 million settlement is the largest in the overdraft litigation. Other banks to settle include Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s Citizens Financial unit, which agreed to pay $137.5 million, and Toronto Dominion Bank, which agreed to pay $62 million.

126,COF,U.S. complaint data puts spotlight on Capital One,"(Reuters) - Despite having less than 6 percent of the U.S. credit card market by purchase volume, Capital One accounts for about 20 percent of card complaints filed with the new federal consumer watchdog, according to a review of nearly a year’s worth of data collected by the agency. The lender is known for its aggressive attempts to woo new customers. Its “What’s in your wallet?” ad campaign, featuring rampaging Vikings and the actor Alec Baldwin, is ubiquitous on television. On Tuesday, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau launched a new database that lets the public see complaint volume for credit card issuers. For now, the public data only goes back to June 1. But via a public records request, Reuters obtained a fuller data set: all credit card-related complaints filed between the CFPB’s opening on July 21, 2011 and May 15 of this year. The data shows that of the 13,502 complaints filed in that period, 2,713 were lodged against Capital One, about 20 percent of all filings. That was about 300 more than the next-closest complaint subject, Citigroup, which has a market share of about 9.5 percent. US Bank had the lowest number of complaints among top-10 issuers: just 2.1 percent of the total. Reuters excluded about 2,400 complaints where the CFPB did not identify the issuer against whom the complaint was being lodged, as well as duplicate complaints identified by the agency. If banks were identified in the 2,400 complaints, their respective share of complaints would change. “We take all concerns and complaints very seriously. We’re constantly working to improve, working directly with our customers to answer questions or resolve any issues they may have. Our goal is to exceed customer expectations,” a spokeswoman for Capital One said on Wednesday. In the most recent period, after June 1, Capital One’s numbers actually ticked up slightly - Capital One accounted for 22 percent of all issues raised in the period. A review of the data shows that Capital One doesn’t just have the most complaints. The McLean, Virginia-based issuer consistently receives more complaints than peers. In 10 of the 11 months for which complaint data is available, Capital One had the most complaints of any issuer, Reuters found. The bank averages about 20 percent of the monthly complaints received by the bureau. The next-closest issuer, the much larger Citigroup, averages about 17.5 percent. Calculated another way, Capital One was the subject of 75 complaints per every 1 million credit cards in circulation, by far the highest among the largest issuers (Citigroup was second at 44 per million cards). The largest category of complaints against Capital One was related to billing disputes or billing statements, followed by complaints related to interest rates, though the bureau’s data did not offer any more specifics on the nature of those complaints. Together those two categories accounted for more than a quarter of all the issues. Other major categories of complaint included unsolicited card issuance and credit reporting. Scott Pluta, acting chief of staff for the Office of Consumer Response at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, declined to comment on Capital One’s complaint levels when Reuters shared its analysis with him. However, he said disclosing the complaint data has a general benefit for consumers. “Consumers can look at this complaint data and they can kind of fairly conclude that they will probably get a similar experience with this institution if they try to engage with a business relationship with them,” Pluta said. The agency plans to expand its online complaints data disclosure to other products, such as mortgages and private student loans, Pluta said. Plans are in the works to disclose the narratives of customers’ complaints in an anonymous fashion. Capital One got its start in credit cards and only entered the retail banking market in 2005. Through an aggressive expansion strategy, including the recent acquisition of online bank ING Direct, it is now one of the 10 largest retail banks in the United States. In a 2011 J.D. Power study of credit card customer satisfaction, Capital One got one of the lowest scores of any major card issuer in the category of “problem resolution.” Overall it ranked seventh of ten for customer satisfaction. According to the Nilson Report, a closely tracked newsletter on the card market, Capital One had a 5.6 percent share of credit card purchase volume in 2011. By way of comparison, American Express led the market with 25.3 percent of purchase volume, yet according to the CFPB it had just 847 complaints. “What you’re seeing with the data ... is really consistent with our experience over time,” an AmEx spokeswoman said. One of the industry’s biggest arguments against the database, though, is that it is just complaints. Anyone can file a complaint, and the raw data does not take into account how valid a complaint is, whether it was resolved, or any other mitigating factors in the bank’s favor. The CFPB said it has taken steps to prevent manipulation of the standings, and that it was open to talking with banks on further measures. The new data being released after June 1 also shows whether the complaint was resolved.

127,COF,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-U.S. complaint data puts spotlight on Capital One,"(Corrects title of Scott Pluta) * Accounts for 20 percent of card complaints in last year * Complaint data part of new consumer watchdog’s mission * Company says it takes all complaints seriously By Rick Rothacker and Cezary Podkul June 20 (Reuters) - Despite having less than 6 percent of the U.S. credit card market by purchase volume, Capital One  accounts for about 20 percent of card complaints filed with the new federal consumer watchdog, according to a review of nearly a year’s worth of data collected by the agency. The lender is known for its aggressive attempts to woo new customers. Its “What’s in your wallet?” ad campaign, featuring rampaging Vikings and the actor Alec Baldwin, is ubiquitous on television. On Tuesday, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau launched a new database that lets the public see complaint volume for credit card issuers. For now, the public data only goes back to June 1. But via a public records request, Reuters obtained a fuller data set: all credit card-related complaints filed between the CFPB’s opening on July 21, 2011 and May 15 of this year. The data shows that of the 13,502 complaints filed in that period, 2,713 were lodged against Capital One, about 20 percent of all filings. That was about 300 more than the next-closest complaint subject, Citigroup, which has a market share of about 9.5 percent. US Bank had the lowest number of complaints among top-10 issuers: just 2.1 percent of the total. Reuters excluded about 2,400 complaints where the CFPB did not identify the issuer against whom the complaint was being lodged, as well as duplicate complaints identified by the agency. If banks were identified in the 2,400 complaints, their respective share of complaints would change. “We take all concerns and complaints very seriously. We’re constantly working to improve, working directly with our customers to answer questions or resolve any issues they may have. Our goal is to exceed customer expectations,” a spokeswoman for Capital One said on Wednesday. In the most recent period, after June 1, Capital One’s numbers actually ticked up slightly - Capital One accounted for 22 percent of all issues raised in the period. A review of the data shows that Capital One doesn’t just have the most complaints. The McLean, Virginia-based issuer consistently receives more complaints than peers. In 10 of the 11 months for which complaint data is available, Capital One had the most complaints of any issuer, Reuters found. The bank averages about 20 percent of the monthly complaints received by the bureau. The next-closest issuer, the much larger Citigroup, averages about 17.5 percent. Calculated another way, Capital One was the subject of 75 complaints per every 1 million credit cards in circulation, by far the highest among the largest issuers (Citigroup was second at 44 per million cards). The largest category of complaints against Capital One was related to billing disputes or billing statements, followed by complaints related to interest rates, though the bureau’s data did not offer any more specifics on the nature of those complaints. Together those two categories accounted for more than a quarter of all the issues. Other major categories of complaint included unsolicited card issuance and credit reporting. Scott Pluta, acting chief of staff for the Office of Consumer Response at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, declined to comment on Capital One’s complaint levels when Reuters shared its analysis with him. However, he said disclosing the complaint data has a general benefit for consumers. “Consumers can look at this complaint data and they can kind of fairly conclude that they will probably get a similar experience with this institution if they try to engage with a business relationship with them,” Pluta said. The agency plans to expand its online complaints data disclosure to other products, such as mortgages and private student loans, Pluta said. Plans are in the works to disclose the narratives of customers’ complaints in an anonymous fashion. Capital One got its start in credit cards and only entered the retail banking market in 2005. Through an aggressive expansion strategy, including the recent acquisition of online bank ING Direct, it is now one of the 10 largest retail banks in the United States. In a 2011 J.D. Power study of credit card customer satisfaction, Capital One got one of the lowest scores of any major card issuer in the category of “problem resolution.” Overall it ranked seventh of ten for customer satisfaction. According to the Nilson Report, a closely tracked newsletter on the card market, Capital One had a 5.6 percent share of credit card purchase volume in 2011. By way of comparison, American Express led the market with 25.3 percent of purchase volume, yet according to the CFPB it had just 847 complaints. “What you’re seeing with the data ... is really consistent with our experience over time,” an AmEx spokeswoman said. One of the industry’s biggest arguments against the database, though, is that it is just complaints. Anyone can file a complaint, and the raw data does not take into account how valid a complaint is, whether it was resolved, or any other mitigating factors in the bank’s favor. The CFPB said it has taken steps to prevent manipulation of the standings, and that it was open to talking with banks on further measures. The new data being released after June 1 also shows whether the complaint was resolved.

129,COF,Consumer agency fines Capital One for card marketing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Capital One Financial agreed to pay $210 million to resolve charges by banking regulators that its call-center representatives misled consumers into paying for extra credit card products. The enforcement action, announced on Wednesday, is the first by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which said it unearthed the activities through an examination of the bank. The CFPB was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law and is nearing its one-year anniversary. The government said $150 million of the sanctions will go to reimburse affected customers, while the remaining penalty will be split between the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which fined the bank $35 million, and the CFPB, which will collect $25 million. “We are putting companies on notice that these deceptive practices are against the law and will not be tolerated,” said CFPB Director Richard Cordray. The regulators alleged that employees at call centers used by Capital One pressured and misled consumers into paying for “add-on products” such as payment protection and credit monitoring when they activated their credit cards. In a briefing with reporters, Cordray said he anticipated actions against other banks over similar tactics but declined to name any targets. “We know these deceptive tactics are not unique to a single institution ... we expect announcements about other institutions as our ongoing work continues to unfold,” Cordray said. In a statement, the president of Capital One’s credit card business, Ryan Schneider, apologized to customers who were affected and said the bank is committed to “making it right.” The bank neither admitted nor denied the government’s findings in reaching the settlement. Late Wednesday the bank also reported its quarterly net income had plunged 90 percent on a large provision for anticipated credit losses. The charges come just months after Capital One battled concerns about its record on consumer issues to win approval from the Federal Reserve to buy ING Group NV’s U.S. online banking unit. That approval came in February after a series of hearings, in which civic groups accused the bank of improper lending practices. On Wednesday the group that led the charge against the merger, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said it felt vindicated by the enforcement action. “Though the merger was approved, it is clear that the scrutiny brought to bear from NCRC’s objections has born results for consumers,” said the group’s president, John Taylor. The CFPB said employees at call centers used by Capital One misled customers by saying these add-on products would improve their credit scores or falsely telling them that the products were free. Capital One blamed the problem on vendors who did not adhere to the company’s sales scripts and said the bank did not adequately monitor their activities. “We are accountable for the actions that vendors take on our behalf,” Capital One’s Schneider said. “These marketing calls were inconsistent with the explicit instructions we provided to agents for how these products should be sold.” In connection with the settlement, the bank also agreed to stop marketing the extra products until it implements a new plan — which the CFPB will first have to approve — to ensure its call centers do not use the deceptive tactics in the future. The bank also agreed to refund affected customers by directly crediting their accounts, and sending checks to those who are no longer Capital one customers. An independent auditor will assess the bank’s compliance with the terms of the agreement, the CFPB said. McLean, Virginia-based Capital One gets over half of its revenue from credit cards and acquired access to about $80 billion in deposits and 7 million new customers from ING.

130,COF,Capital One profit plunges on higher provisions,"(Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp’s net income plunged 90 percent on higher credit loss reserves from its purchase of HSBC Plc’s U.S. credit card portfolio, but the lender said it expected the deal to have a modest impact on reserves in the current quarter. Capital One has spent much of the past decade transforming itself from a specialty credit card lender dependent on bond market funding into a bank that relies on deposits. The company last year bought online deposit taker ING Direct, making it the fifth-largest U.S. bank by deposits, and bulked up its credit card division with a deal to buy HSBC’s domestic business, totaling $30 billion in credit card loans. McLean, Virginia-based Capital One, which gets over half of its revenue from credit cards, recorded net income for the second quarter of $92 million, or 16 cents per share, down from $911 million, or $1.97 per share, a year earlier. From continuing operations, it earned 33 cents in the quarter, net of tax. Total net revenue was up 2 percent at $5.1 billion. Provision for credit losses rose to $1.68 billion from $343 million. Provisions in the quarter included a $1.2 billion allowance build for the non-impaired loans brought on to the balance sheet as a result of the HSBC U.S. card acquisition. But Capital One, which had warned of a ‘significant build in allowance’ in the second quarter due to the integration of the new units, said it does not expect to see a similar impact on reserves in the current quarter. Period-end loans in the domestic card business increased by $27.6 billion to $80.27 billion, largely due to the addition of the HSBC U.S. card portfolio.

134,COF,Your Money: How you can benefit from the Capital One settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Capital One Financial settlement with U.S. regulators over deceptive marketing of credit card “add-on products” means a lot to all consumers, not just Capital One customers, according to consumer advocates. This is the first enforcement action by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, which is about to hit its first anniversary. Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director of advocacy group U.S. PIRG, says it’s significant to the future of the agency that this first move was against a big company over a pernicious practice. “This is a big event for a young agency,” he said. “They brought their first action against one of the biggest, most politically active firms, and that will send a clear message that violations of the law will not be tolerated.” Capital One agreed to pay $150 million to reimburse more than 2 million customers who bought aggressively marketed payment protection and credit monitoring services; customers will get a credit on their accounts or a check in the mail. What does the CFPB action mean for Capital One customers and everyone else? 1. Stronger warnings for consumers about add-on services The settlement should show consumers that they need to beware of pitches they hear from credit card issuers, especially when activating a card. The CFPB says Capital One violated regulations that prohibit call-center vendors from engaging in deceptive tactics to sell the company’s credit card add-on products, specifically payment protection plans and credit-monitoring services. First of all, Mierzwinski said, “Consumers should know that credit protection and monitoring are the worst add-on products you can buy.” Travis Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, is no kinder, referring to these services as “junk products.” The CFPB also issued a warning to consumers on what to watch out for with these products, primarily that you should be wary of any pitch when you are activating a new credit card. (here) Ryan Schneider, president of Capital One's card business, said, ""We are accountable for the actions that vendors take on our behalf. These marketing calls were inconsistent with the explicit instructions we provided to agents for how these products should be sold."" (link.reuters.com/xyz49s) 2. Customers will get no-hassle refunds. Capital One is responsible, with oversight, for determining who is entitled to refunds and will either credit current accounts or mail out checks. The CFPB emphasizes that ease for consumers is its main concern: “It’s been important to make sure that the refunds were managed in a way that was convenient to consumers. Consumers are not required to take any action.” The agency says customers will be reimbursed according to how much they spent, and the settlement is just an estimate of how much it will cost. An additional $60 million goes into the Civil Penalty Fund, which was created under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law as a reserve to reimburse victims and for consumer education and financial literacy programs. (For more information on refunds see link.reuters.com/suz49s) 3. Others might benefit directly, too. “This settlement is not unique and I expect there to be more activity,” CFPB director Richard Cordray said at a press conference on Wednesday. Plunkett said the deceptive practices that got Capital One in trouble are widespread in the industry. “This is a shot across the bow of all companies selling junk financial products and misleading consumers about them - that they better be more careful. It has direct effect and a hugely significant effect on the whole financial services industry,” he said. While Capital One is the only company currently not allowed to market these add-on credit card products at all - they have to get a plan approved by the CFPB before they can resume - Mierzwinski expects other credit card issuers to stop selling them. “It would be stupid to continue to market this kind of product,” he said. But Brian Riley, who worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and First Union/Wachovia (now Wells Fargo & Co) for many years and is now senior research director for the CEB Tower Group, said such practices may be too complicated to unravel because they are already baked into the revenue models for the next three years. “You can’t just unplug it if you’re a publicly traded company,” he said, adding that some banks may “self-confess” to the CFPB and take their lumps. 4. Other shoes will drop. Both the CFPB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which partnered on the action against Capital One, have web-based complaint systems where consumers can enter information. The CFPB says it will follow up with any Capital One customers who feel they didn’t get a refund when they were due one, and also for customers of other banks who feel they’ve been duped. The CFPB is currently collecting consumer complaints on a number of other topics and following up on them, including student loans, other credit card complaints and credit report errors. (see consumerfinance.gov) While future enforcement actions are rarely telegraphed in advance, Plunkett hopes that next on the agenda are mortgage services abuses and payday lending practices. And he has high hopes for what is to come. “They probably have a lot of things they are investigating, and it’s a good sign that they didn’t pick an obscure corner of the marketplace to get started,” he said.

138,COF,How you can benefit from the Capital One settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Capital One Financial settlement with U.S. regulators over deceptive marketing of credit card “add-on products” means a lot to all consumers, not just Capital One customers, according to consumer advocates. This is the first enforcement action by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, which is about to hit its first anniversary. Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director of advocacy group U.S. PIRG, says it’s significant to the future of the agency that this first move was against a big company over a pernicious practice. “This is a big event for a young agency,” he said. “They brought their first action against one of the biggest, most politically active firms, and that will send a clear message that violations of the law will not be tolerated.” Capital One agreed to pay $150 million to reimburse more than 2 million customers who bought aggressively marketed payment protection and credit monitoring services; customers will get a credit on their accounts or a check in the mail. What does the CFPB action mean for Capital One customers and everyone else? 1. Stronger warnings for consumers about add-on services The settlement should show consumers that they need to beware of pitches they hear from credit card issuers, especially when activating a card. The CFPB says Capital One violated regulations that prohibit call-center vendors from engaging in deceptive tactics to sell the company’s credit card add-on products, specifically payment protection plans and credit-monitoring services. First of all, Mierzwinski said, “Consumers should know that credit protection and monitoring are the worst add-on products you can buy.” Travis Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, is no kinder, referring to these services as “junk products.” The CFPB also issued a warning to consumers on what to watch out for with these products, primarily that you should be wary of any pitch when you are activating a new credit card. (here) Ryan Schneider, president of Capital One's card business, said, ""We are accountable for the actions that vendors take on our behalf. These marketing calls were inconsistent with the explicit instructions we provided to agents for how these products should be sold."" (link.reuters.com/xyz49s) 2. Customers will get no-hassle refunds. Capital One is responsible, with oversight, for determining who is entitled to refunds and will either credit current accounts or mail out checks. The CFPB emphasizes that ease for consumers is its main concern: “It’s been important to make sure that the refunds were managed in a way that was convenient to consumers. Consumers are not required to take any action.” The agency says customers will be reimbursed according to how much they spent, and the settlement is just an estimate of how much it will cost. An additional $60 million goes into the Civil Penalty Fund, which was created under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law as a reserve to reimburse victims and for consumer education and financial literacy programs. (For more information on refunds see link.reuters.com/suz49s) 3. Others might benefit directly, too. “This settlement is not unique and I expect there to be more activity,” CFPB director Richard Cordray said at a press conference on Wednesday. Plunkett said the deceptive practices that got Capital One in trouble are widespread in the industry. “This is a shot across the bow of all companies selling junk financial products and misleading consumers about them - that they better be more careful. It has direct effect and a hugely significant effect on the whole financial services industry,” he said. While Capital One is the only company currently not allowed to market these add-on credit card products at all - they have to get a plan approved by the CFPB before they can resume - Mierzwinski expects other credit card issuers to stop selling them. “It would be stupid to continue to market this kind of product,” he said. But Brian Riley, who worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and First Union/Wachovia (now Wells Fargo & Co) for many years and is now senior research director for the CEB Tower Group, said such practices may be too complicated to unravel because they are already baked into the revenue models for the next three years. “You can’t just unplug it if you’re a publicly traded company,” he said, adding that some banks may “self-confess” to the CFPB and take their lumps. 4.

The settlement covers a wide array of conduct, including improper foreclosures and credit-card interest rates that were above the 6 percent allowed for certain service members. Capital One and U.S. authorities said in a consent order that a bank-ordered independent review identified some of the violations, which date from 2006 to 2011. The $12 million will be distributed among at least 4,000 service members, Thomas Perez, the assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights, said in a conference call with reporters. The agreement comes the same month that Capitol One became the first company to be fined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

146,COF,UPDATE 1-Capital One's top shareholder ING to sell stake,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp said its top stakeholder ING Bank NV intends to sell all of its stake in the company in a public offering. The stake sale of about 54 million shares could be worth about $3 billion, based on the stock’s Tuesday closing price of $56.49. ING Investment Management, a unit of Netherlands-based ING Groep, had a 9.31 percent stake in Capital One as of June 30, according to Thomson Reuters data. The offering comes just months after the lender won approval from the Federal Reserve to buy ING Groep’s U.S. online banking unit in February. Capital One agreed in June last year to buy ING Direct from the Dutch banking and insurance group for $8.9 billion in stock and cash. The deal generated concern from consumer groups who argued it would create another “too big to fail” bank. For ING, the sale was part of a restructuring forced by a 10 billion euro bailout received in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. BofA Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup will act as joint book-running managers for the secondary offering. The offering follows $1.25 billion common stock sale by the lender in March to pay for a portion of its acquisition of HSBC’s U.S. credit card business.

148,COF,Capital One profit surges after acquisitions,"(Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp’s (COF.N) quarterly profit rose 44 percent after two big acquisitions, but the lender said increasing competition for automobile and commercial loans may curb future growth. Capital One’s loan book has been boosted by its purchase of online bank ING Direct for nearly $9 billion and its purchase of HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HSBA.L) U.S. credit card portfolio, which added another $30 billion in credit card loans. Like other banks, auto loans and commercial and industrial lending have helped Capital One offset lackluster consumer loan demand but, as more lenders chase the same customers, underwriting standards have fallen. McLean, Virginia-based Capital One said new auto loans fell 9 percent from second-quarter levels. “I think there’s more competition which takes a bit off some of the extremely high growth that we’ve had in the past,” CEO Rich Fairbanks said on a post-earnings conference call. Fairbanks added the company expects to see weak consumer demand for the foreseeable future. Capital One has spent much of the past decade transforming itself from a specialty credit card issuer dependent on bond market funding into a bank that relies on deposits. With a market value of about $34 billion, it is now a top 10 U.S. bank by deposits. Net income for the third quarter rose to $1.17 billion, or $2.01 per share, from $813 million, or $1.77 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 40 percent to $5.78 billion. The company’s capital ratios rose as well. Its estimated Basel I Tier 1 common ratio was about 10.7 percent as of September 30, up from 9.9 percent at the end of June. “Given our strong capital trajectory, we expect to exceed an assumed Basel III Tier 1 common ratio target of 8 percent in 2013,” Chief Financial Officer Gary Perlin said in a statement. The company signaled again that it may return more capital next year to shareholders as a result of the strong growth, if regulators agree. “With every passing quarter we get more capital and more clarity on what the rules of the game are and that puts us in a position to distribute more of it,” Perlin said on the conference call. The results were a stark contrast to the company’s second quarter, when profit fell 90 percent on higher credit loss reserves related to the HSBC card purchase. The lender said then it expected the impact to moderate thereafter. The company’s shares were up 2 percent after the bell. They closed at $57.24 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

Capital One bought online bank ING Direct and HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HSBA.L) $30 billion U.S. credit card portfolio last year, boosting earnings. But a weak fourth-quarter and a disappointing revenue outlook are prompting analysts to dial back their growth expectations for the company. “It’s just the magnitude of benefit from the acquisitions that’s being questioned. Investors had gotten their expectations higher than the company could deliver in 2013,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Jason Arnold said. He cut his price target on the stock to $67 from $76. Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch said the company seemed to have significantly cut its revenue growth prospects just a few months after the deals closed. “The company will likely be challenged to generate significant earnings growth in future periods, as any meaningful growth in card receivables will likely have to also result in an increase in the reserve,” Orenbuch said in a note to clients. Capital One shares were down 8 percent at $56.94 in heavy trading on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

167,COF,"Capital One profit beats, co plans share buyback in fourth quarter","(Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp’s (COF.N) first-quarter profit beat analysts’ expectations as net interest income jumped 34 percent, and the company said it would buy back shares after closing the sale of its credit card accounts linked to electronics retailer Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N). Capital One, one of the large U.S. credit card issuers, said in February it would sell to Citigroup (C.N) its $7 billion portfolio of private label and co-branded credit card accounts linked to electronics retailer Best Buy. “We’ve started discussions with our regulators to seek approval to begin share repurchases in 2013,” Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts. Chief Financial Officer Gary Perlin said Capital One would wait until the sale closes in the third quarter to begin stock repurchases. Capital One passed the Federal Reserve stress test last month, and the Fed did not object to the company’s capital plan. It expects to raise its dividend to 30 cents per share from 5 cents per share beginning in May. The company reiterated its 2013 operating expenses forecast of $11 billion. “In 2014, we expect operating expense to improve to about $10.4 billion,” Fairbank said. Shares of the company, which has a market value of about $31 billion, rose 2 percent after the bell. They had closed at $52.79 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s net income fell to $1.06 billion, or $1.79 per share, in the quarter from $1.40 billion, or $2.72 per share a year earlier, when the company recorded a $594 million gain related to its purchase of ING’s online banking business. Excluding the gain, the company had earned $1.56 per share a year earlier. Total net revenue rose 12 percent to $5.55 billion. Analysts on average had expected the lender to earn $1.60 per share on revenue of $5.58 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Capital One’s net charge off rate — the percentage of loans written off as unrecoverable — fell marginally by 6 basis points from the end of the fourth quarter. The company, one of the large credit card issuers in the United States, set aside $885 million to cover bad loans in the first quarter, down 23 percent from the fourth quarter, largely driven by a $261 million release in allowance. “The largest component of the allowance release was in domestic card, due to better-than-anticipated credit performance in the quarter, including delinquencies,” the company said in a statement.

171,COF,Fitch: Lower Costs Drive Capital One's Earnings Improvement,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 19 (Fitch) Capital One Financial's (COF) first quarter 2013  (1Q'13) earnings improved to $1.05 billion, up from $825 million in 4Q'12.  This  was largely driven by a reduction in expenses from the prior quarter, helping  COF deliver a strong 1.51% return on average assets (ROAA) in the quarter.   Fitch Ratings would expect continued earnings momentum to be more challenging  going forward as it will be dependent on loan growth, which Fitch notes was down  this quarter. Loans were down 7%, or $14.6 billion, from the sequential quarter half of which  was due to the pending sale of the Best Buy card portfolio.  The remainder of  the decline primarily came from COF's domestic card portfolio and the continued  planned run-off of acquired mortgage loans partially offset by 3% growth in auto  loans and very modest growth in commercial loans. As such, COF's total revenue was down 1% from the sequential quarter primarily  driven by lower loan balances and lower purchase volumes, partially offset by  higher net interest margin (NIM). COF's NIM was 6.71% which despite the lower  loan levels noted above, benefited from the redemption of high cost trust  preferred securities which helped drive the company's cost of funds down. The bigger benefit to earnings, however, came from a reduction in provision  expense from the sequential quarter of $266 million, driven by $261 million of  allowance release, as well as a reduction in non-interest expense of $227  million, or 7%, due in part to lower marketing expenses as well as lower  acquisition related expenses. Given that COF is a relatively efficient company with an efficiency ratio of  54.55%, which compares favorably with some peer institutions, Fitch notes that  further earnings improvement will be heavily predicated on loan growth, which  Fitch believes could remain challenging over a near-to-intermediate term time  horizon. Overall credit metrics continue to be strong with overall net charge-off rates  (NCO), 30 day plus performing delinquency rates, and non-performing asset rates  all declining from the sequential quarter.  While there was a very modest  up-tick in credit card NCO rates, Fitch believes this was largely due to some  seasonality as well as the continued seasoning of some of the HSBC acquired  loans.  On balance, Fitch continues to view credit metrics across most of COF's  lending categories as near a cyclical low, and Fitch would expect metrics to  deteriorate over an intermediate to long term time horizon. Fitch notes that COF's capital position remains good, with the company's Tier 1  common ratio increasing to 11.8% in 1Q'13 up from 11% in the sequential quarter.  Given this, as well as the company's earnings generation, Fitch expects the  expected increase in the dividend to $0.30 per share from $0.05 per share to be  easily absorbable within the context of earnings.

172,COF,Capital One in $3.5 million settlement on auto loan losses,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp agreed to pay $3.5 million to resolve charges that it understated losses from auto loans in the months leading up to the financial crisis, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday. The SEC said Capital One failed to properly account for losses in the second and third quarters of 2007, even though the bank’s auto lending arm was facing much higher delinquencies than it originally forecast. In a statement, the bank said no consumers were affected by the conduct and it will not be required to restate financial results under the deal. “The settlement will not affect any current or future business activities by Capital One,” the bank said. Capital One’s auto loan business relied on loans to subprime borrowers, the SEC said. As credit markets began to deteriorate in 2006 and 2007, the bank failed to incorporate assessments into its disclosures that found that the decline had a significant impact on its loan loss expense. The bank understated its second-quarter loan loss expense by 18 percent and its third-quarter loan loss expense by 9 percent, the SEC said. The SEC settled related charges against the bank’s former chief risk officer, Peter Schnall, and former divisional credit officer David Lagassa, who agreed to pay $85,000 and $50,000 in penalties, respectively. Schnall and Lagassa remain with Capital One, a bank spokeswoman said. Schnall is serving in a senior advisory role until the end of the year, and Lagassa is a managing vice president in financial services, the spokeswoman, Tatiana Stead, said.

177,COF,UPDATE 2-Capital One profit boosted by higher credit card spending,"* 2nd-qtr net profit rises to $1.10 bln from $92 mln * Net interest income from credit cards up 19 pct * Provision for credit losses down 55 pct * Shares up about 2 pct in post-market trading By Avik Das July 18 (Reuters) - A gradual recovery in U.S. consumer spending helped Capital One Financial Corp to raise net interest income from its credit card business in the second quarter and beat Wall Street forecasts on earnings. Capital One, one of the largest credit card issuers in the United States, expects its strong performance to continue in the third quarter, Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said. Its shares were up 2 percent in after-hours trading. Net interest income, the difference between what banks earn on loans and pay out on deposits, rose about 14 percent to $4.55 billion in the second quarter, Capital One said. Net interest income specifically from its credit card business rose 19 percent to $2.80 billion. U.S.-issued cards contributed 90 percent of the total. U.S. consumer spending in the second quarter is expected to have risen 8 percent, compared with 7 percent in the preceding quarter, Credit Suisse has estimated. American Express Co said on Wednesday that cardmember spending rose 8 percent in the second quarter after adjusting for foreign currency translations. Susquehanna analyst James Friedman said Capital One was one of the few companies to have seen an improvement in its net interest margin. The bank’s revenue has grown at a faster pace than its expenses, he said. Net interest margin rose to 6.83 percent in the second quarter from 6.04 percent a year earlier. Capital One, which has a market value of about $39 billion, set aside $762 million to cover bad loans in the second quarter, down 55 percent from a year earlier. The lender had set aside $1.2 billion in the year-ago quarter for non-impaired loans from its purchase of HSBC Plc’s  U.S. credit card portfolio. Net income rose to $1.10 billion, or $1.87 per share, from $92 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 12 percent to $5.64 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.72 per share on revenue of $5.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s net charge-off rate, the percentage of loans written off as unrecoverable, fell to 2.03 percent from 2.20 percent in the preceding quarter. “We generally see some seasonal improvement this time of year, although what we saw in the second quarter was better than what we would expect,” Fairbank said on a post-earnings call. Capital One, which passed the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stress test in March, said this month it would buy back up to $1 billion in shares after completing the sale of its Best Buy Co Inc portfolio in the third quarter. The bank has spent much of the past decade transforming itself from a specialty credit card lender dependent on bond market funding into a bank that relies on deposits. It is now one of the top 10 U.S. banks by deposits, and has over 1,000 branches. McLean, Virginia-based Capital One’s shares closed at $67.05 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. They have risen about 27 percent since the company’s last quarterly results in April, outperforming the Thomson Reuters Consumer Financial Services Index, which has risen about 18 percent in the same period.",7182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/capitalonefinancial-results/update-2-capital-one-profit-boosted-by-higher-credit-card-spending-idUSL4N0FO43F20130718
178,COF,Fitch:  Reserve Release Helps Boost Capital One's 2Q13 Earnings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes Capital One Financial's (COF)  solid 2Q'13 earnings performance benefited from a sizable reserve release in the  quarter, though core earnings remained good.  COF's Fitch calculated return on  average assets (ROA) was 1.50%, 27 basis points of which are attributable to the  $199 million reserve release.  Excluding this, the Fitch calculated ROA would  have been 1.23%, which is still good, but lower than headline number suggests. COF's pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) was essentially flat from the sequential  quarter, but up substantially from the year ago quarter.  The company's net  interest income (NII) remained relatively steady from the sequential quarter,  but non-interest income increased by 10.6% due to higher interchange fees driven  by increased purchase volumes.   The year-over-year growth in COF's revenue was due to higher interest income  from improved loan yields, partially as a result of a mix shift in higher  yielding private-label loans, lower interest expense, as well as higher  interchange revenue boosting non-interest income. COF's 2Q'13 earnings also benefited from lower provision expense on the quarter,  as the provision expense declined to $762 million, down from $885 million in the  sequential quarter and $1.67 billion in the year-ago quarter.  This was likely  largely due to continued strong credit quality.  Thirty-day-plus delinquencies  and net charge-off rates (NCOs) on an aggregate basis continue to remain near  cyclical lows, and this is particularly true in cards, which is COF's biggest  lending product. Expenses remained relatively steady from the sequential quarter and modestly  down from the year-ago quarter, which is in large part due to fewer acquisition  and integration costs given that COF has been integrating both the ING Direct  business as well as the private-label credit card business previously owned by  HSBC. Total loans were down modestly, as a moderate decline in cards and an expected  decline in home loans with the run-off of COF's acquired portfolio was offset by  some growth in commercial loans and continued growth in auto loans.  Fitch  continues to believe that meaningful core earnings expansion for COF will be  predicated on future loan growth - particularly in cards - as the benefit from  reserve releases will begin to wane over a medium-term time horizon. Fitch notes that COF's capital position remains good with the company's Tier 1  common ratio ticked up to 12.1% at June 30, 2013 from 11.8% at March 31 2013.   Additionally, under the Basel 3 framework, COF estimates its Tier 1 common ratio  to be above its assumed target of 8% at 8.5% as of June 30, 2013.  Including the  impact of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) on this ratio would  reduce it to approximately 8.3% as of the end of 2Q'13. Given the company's good capital ratios, its strong capital generation, and  still relatively modest loan growth, Fitch believes COF may begin to look to  return capital to shareholders via share buybacks over a near-to-medium-term  time horizon.

180,COF,"Capital One beats estimates, seeks higher capital return","(Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) posted a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates after setting aside less money to cover credit card defaults, sending its shares up 2 percent after the bell. The bank, one of the largest credit card issuers in the United States, also plans to return more cash to shareholders next year, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Crawford said on a post-earnings conference call. He said Capital One would request a payout “well above the industry norm of 50 percent” when it submits its 2014 capital plan to the Federal Reserve, which conducts annual stress tests to determine whether U.S. banks can return cash to shareholders. Capital One has spent much of the past decade transforming itself from a specialty credit card issuer dependent on bond market funding into one of the top 10 U.S. banks by deposits, with more than a thousand branches nationwide. The McLean, Virginia-based company set aside $849 million to cover bad loans in the third quarter, 16 percent less than a year earlier. “The surprise probably came in terms of the provisions, which were lower than what many analysts expected,” said Sameer Gokhale, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets. Net interest income, the difference between what banks earn on loans and pay out on deposits, fell 2 percent to $4.56 billion in the quarter ended September 30. Capital One passed the Federal Reserve’s stress test in March, after which it raised its quarterly dividend to 30 cents per share from 5 cents per share and launched a $1 billion buyback. The company bought back shares worth $300 million in the third quarter and expects to complete the buyback in the fourth quarter, Crawford said. He did not say how the bank intended to distribute capital to shareholders next year. Sanjay Sakhrani, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said his brokerage’s model estimated that Capital One could pay out about 74 percent of its earnings in 2014, which could equate to about $2.8 billion in buybacks and dividends. Despite beating analysts’ estimates, Capital One still recorded a 6 percent decline in net income in the third quarter. Credit card usage in the United States declined for a third straight month in August, as tepid consumer spending coupled with uncertainty around the partial government shutdown hurt consumer sentiment. Rival credit card issuer American Express Co (AXP.N), which has a greater proportion of corporate card users, is less exposed to the wider consumer spending slowdown and on Wednesday posted a rise in quarterly profit. Capital One’s net charge-off rate, the percentage of loans written off as unrecoverable, was 1.92 percent, an increase of 17 basis points from the year-earlier quarter. “Over the next two quarters, we expect a temporary increase in delinquencies and charge-offs beyond normal seasonality,” Capital One Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said on the call. Net income available to stockholders was $1.10 billion, or $1.86 per share, for the third quarter. Net revenue fell 2 percent to $5.65 billion. Analysts on average expected the company to earn $1.80 per share on revenue of $5.58 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Capital One’s shares, which have risen 35 percent in the past six months, rose to $73.50 in extended trading on Thursday after closing at $72.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.

184,COF,Fitch: Flat 3Q13 Earnings for Capital One Financial,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 18 (Fitch) Capital One Financial's (COF) third quarter 2013  (3Q13) earnings were essentially unchanged from the sequential quarter and  modestly lower from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, Fitch Ratings views  COF's return on average assets (ROA) in 3Q13 of 1.53% as good and notes that it  compares favorably to some peer banks. Overall revenue was essentially flat from the linked quarter with both flat net  interest income (NII) and flat non-interest income relative to 2Q13. NII was  impacted by lower loan balances with the run-off of mortgage loans, the run-off  of some card loans, and the completion of the sale of the Best Buy private-label  portfolio offset by some continued growth in auto lending and growth in  commercial banking. Given that the loans that were running-off were generally at lower yields than  the average of the portfolio, COF was able to keep its loan yields stable  relative to the sequential quarter. Additionally, amid the steepening of the  long-end of the yield curve during the quarter, which caused a slowdown in  pre-payment speeds of mortgage-backed securities and therefore lower premium  amortizations resulted in higher reinvestment yields, it boosted COF's yield on  its investment securities by approximately five basis points. This modest lift to asset yields, coupled with a few basis points improvement in  the company's cost of funds, drove a modestly higher net interest margin (NIM)  of 6.89% in 3Q13, up from 6.82% in the sequential quarter. Fitch would expect  COF's NIM to be stable to modestly down over the near-to-medium term as the  lower prepayment speeds are slowing the run-off of the lower yielding mortgages  on COF's balance sheet, and Fitch continues to believe that COF's cost of funds  is nearing or at a floor. Expenses were up as an approximate $100 million increase in litigation reserves  offset approximately $31 million in lower marketing expenses. Additionally, with  continued strong credit, COF's effective reserve release on the quarter was $88  million, which helped to offset the legal reserve noted above and keep the  company's net income stable. Fitch believes that meaningful growth in net income for COF (as well as others  in the banking industry) continues to be heavily predicated on meaningful loan  growth as the significant benefits from reserve releases and cost savings are  beginning to wane. COF's credit quality remains good and is at or near a cyclical trough. Overall  credit card net-charge off (NCO) rates continue to decline as do NCO rates in  commercial lending, partially offset by higher NCO rates in auto loans. However,  NCO rates in auto loans are coming off a very low base, so Fitch has expected  for some time an eventual reversion in NCO rates. COF's Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I was up to 12.7% in 3Q13. Under Basel III  fully phased in standardized approaches the pro forma Tier 1 common ratio would  have been 11.1%, and under Basel III advanced approaches the Tier 1 common ratio  would have been slightly higher than 8%. COF's Basel III advanced approach Tier 1 common ratio is slightly lower than  some other peer banks, but COF's capital generation remains strong. As such,  Fitch would expect COF to buyback more shares over the course of the year now  that it has completed the sale of the Best Buy private label credit card  portfolio.

185,COF,Capital One shares could jump 40 percent: Barron's,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of credit card issuer Capital One Financial (COF.N) could jump 40 percent in the next three years, according to a report in financial weekly Barron’s on Sunday. The report cites the stock’s recent underperformance, low valuation, an attractive outlook for dividends, its stock buyback and a plan to aggressively cut costs. Capital One's stock has risen 24 percent this year compared to a 27 percent rise in the S&P; 500 .SPX and a 43 percent jump in the SPDR Regional Banking exchange traded fund (KRE.P), Barron's said, adding it has underperformed rivals Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) and American Express (AXP.N). “Misfires” at the company have created doubts about its strategy and execution, which are holding the stock back, Barron’s said, citing a recent earnings miss amid higher costs. Capital One’s shares closed Friday at $71.63, or 10 times earnings. That compares to 11, 12, or 13 times earnings at regional banking and credit card peers. The share price is roughly in line with book value of $71.70, Barron’s said. The company has committed to returning 50 percent of earnings to shareholders in 2014, is buying back stock, and could boost its annual dividend, Barron’s said.

195,COF,Fitch: Uneventful 1Q'14 Earnings for Capital One Financial,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 17 (Fitch) Capital One Financial's (COF) first quarter 2014  (1Q'14) earnings of $1.14 billion were higher relative to both the sequential  and year-ago quarters, thanks in part to a $208 million reserve release in the  quarter, says Fitch Ratings.  These results equated to a good 1.53% return on  average assets (ROA) in 1Q'14, which compares well to other large regional  banks. Not including the reserve release, COF's ROA would have been in the 1.26% range,  which Fitch notes is still a good result.  Additionally, Fitch notes that this  adjusted ROA is likely a good run-rate for COF for the balance of the year, as  Fitch believes reserve releases should begin to abate. Total revenue declined from both the sequential and year-ago quarters given  lower net interest income (NII) due in part to modestly lower loan balances  relative to the sequential quarter, and lower non-interest income despite higher  purchase volumes.  Additionally, the company's net interest margin (NIM)  declined to 6.62% in 1Q'14 from 6.73% in the sequential quarter and 6.71% in the  year-ago quarter. Expenses declined due in part to lower marketing expenses relative to the  sequential quarter and relatively flat marketing expenses relative to the year  ago quarter.  The bigger impact to the expense line item, however, was the  adoption of a new accounting standard for the company's low income housing tax  credits in its commercial business.  This moved these credits out of the expense  line item and into the income tax line item.  Other than the different  accounting classification this didn't have a significant impact on bottom line  results. As previously noted, the overall loan portfolio was down relative to the  sequential quarter.  Domestic credit cards, COF's largest lending category,  declined as did loans in its consumer banking segment which includes auto loans  and legacy mortgages.  In this segment continued growth in auto was largely  offset by the expected run-off of the legacy mortgage loans.  The commercial  banking unit, COF's smallest, which includes traditional C&I; lending as well as  some Commercial Real Estate (CRE) lending had some modest growth, but given its  smaller size, was unable to offset the decline in lower card balances. Credit quality for COF--as well as the rest of the industry--continues to be  very strong, with the overall net charge-off (NCO) rate declining to 1.92% in  1Q'14.  Fitch continues to believe that credit quality for COF and the banking  industry continues to be at or near a cyclical trough, and Fitch would expect  some deterioration in credit metrics over a medium-term time horizon. COF's Tier 1 common equity (CET1) ratio under the Basel III standardized  approach was 13% in 1Q'14, and under the advanced approach was above its target  of 8%.  Fitch continues to view COF's capital ratios as adequate, but below the  average of some similarly rated entities.  However, in Fitch's view, this  continues to be offset by COF's superior capital generation abilities relative  to some peers.

197,COF,UPDATE 1-Capital One defeats patent lawsuit brought by Intellectual Ventures,"(Adds IV statement, detail from ruling and IV background) By Dan Levine April 16 (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp  defeated a lawsuit on Wednesday brought by large patent owner Intellectual Ventures, after a U.S. judge invalidated two of IV’s patents, according to the court opinion. Intellectual Ventures filed separate patent lawsuits against several financial institutions last year, including Capital One, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp. However, the Capital One case had been further along procedurally. U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga in Virginia dismissed the lawsuit against Capital One after finding that the two IV patents remaining in the case were abstract ideas that could not be patented. One patent involved electronic financial databases, and the other customized web interfaces. The two IV patents declared invalid had also been asserted by IV against Bank of America, court filings show. That litigation is still pending. In a statement, IV chief litigation counsel Melissa Finocchio said the company would continue to pursue a second lawsuit against Capital One that IV filed in Maryland. “We are disappointed with the court’s decision and are considering our options,” Finocchio said. A representative for Capital One could not immediately be reached for comment. Created in 2000, Intellectual Ventures has raised about $6 billion and acquired 70,000 patents and other intellectual property assets. Over the years IV and other firms like it have faced criticism from some in the technology industry, who argue that firms like IV, which do not primarily make products, exploit the patent system by demanding royalties and threatening litigation. IV argues that by buying patents from inventors, it creates a mechanism for them to capitalize on their ideas. The company is seeking to raise a new $3 billion patent acquisition fund, a 2013 investor presentation reviewed by Reuters shows. Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp have agreed to participate in IV’s new fund, while Apple Inc and Intel Corp declined. The Capital One case in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia is Intellectual Ventures I LLC et al. vs. Capital One Financial Corporation et al., 13-740.

199,COF,NYAG says Capital One to use database only to bar fraudsters-NYT,"June 16 (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp has agreed to fundamentally change the way it uses consumer database, ChexSystems, to restrict only customers who land in the database for fraud, the New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter. The deal stems from a broader investigation by NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman into how U.S. banks use private databases, the newspaper said. (r.reuters.com/syg22w) As part of an inquiry, Schneiderman requested more information from six banks, including Bank of America, Capital One and JPMorgan Chase, sending letters expressing concern that banks might be “improperly denying or otherwise restricting banking access to New York consumers,” the New York Times said. Databases such as ChexSystems provide data on how consumers handle deposit accounts at banks. A consumer’s ChexSystems report typically contains banking irregularities such as check overdrafts, unsatisfied balances, depositing fraudulent checks, or suspicious account handling. Such databases were intended to weed out serial fraudsters.  However, regulators say banks are screening out potential customers and swelling the ranks of the so-called “unbanked” - the roughly 10 million households in the United States that lack even a basic bank account, according to the NYT. Other regulators such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are also starting to examine the role these databases play in restricting access to the banking system, the newspaper said. Capital One and the NY AG’s office did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment outside regular U.S. business hours.

202,COF,Fitch: Slightly Higher 2Q'14 Earnings for Capital One Financial,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 18 (Fitch) Capital One Financial's (COF) second quarter 2014  (2Q'14) earnings were modestly higher than both the sequential and year-ago  quarters due largely a moderate reserve release as provision expense was less  than net-charge offs (NCO) and higher net interchange revenue on increased  purchase volumes and lower start-up costs on new rewards programs, according to  Fitch Ratings. These results equated to a 1.63% return on average assets (ROA), which Fitch  notes is a good result.  Given that Fitch expects reserve releases to further  abate over the course of the year due to credit quality likely being near or at  a cyclical trough and some loan growth necessitating higher provisioning, Fitch  would expect the company's ROA to trend down at some point over the next couple  of quarters. That said, COF remains sensitive to higher short-term interest rates, so should  they begin to rise (whenever that may be), this could help support the company's  ROA over an intermediate to longer-term time horizon. Total net revenue was up 2% relative to the sequential quarter as growth in net  interchange revenue amid higher purchase volumes and lower costs on some rewards  programs offset continued pressure on asset yields weighed on  net interest  income (NII) and the company's net interest margin (NIM), which came in at 6.55%  in 2Q'14.  Relative to the year-ago quarter total net revenue was down 3% driven  by lower NII and lower services charges on deposit accounts offset by higher net  interchange revenue. Non-interest expenses were up 2% relative to the sequential quarter, but down 1%  relative to the year-ago quarters.  Marketing expense modestly increased  relative to the sequential quarter as did other operating expenses, of which  higher occupancy and professional services costs were the drivers, in part  offset by lower acquisition related expenses.  Given the challenging revenue  environment amid the protracted low interest rate environment, Fitch continues  to expect expense management to be a focus of COF as well as the rest of the  banking industry.  Credit quality continues to be strong across COF's various lending products,  though there has been some very modest reversion in delinquencies and  non-performing assets for the company's auto loans.  Nevertheless this reversion  is off of a very low base.  On balance, Fitch continues to believe that credit  quality for COF, as well as its peer banks, is nearing or at a cyclical trough,  and Fitch would expect some reversion in these metrics over an intermediate to  longer-term time horizon. COF's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the Basel III fully phased in  advanced approach (COF's binding constraint) remained above its target of 8%.   Fitch continues to view COF's capital ratios as adequate, but below the average  of some similarly rated entities.  However, in Fitch's view, this continues to  be offset by COF's superior capital generation abilities relative to some peers.

203,COF,Fitch Affirms Capital One at 'A-/F1' Following Large Regional Bank Review; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Capital One Financial  Corporation's (COF) ratings at 'A-/F1'.  The Rating Outlook remains Stable.   The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T; Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T; Bank Corporation (MTB), PNC Financial Services  Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US  Bancorp (USB), UnionBanCal Corporation (UBC), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and  Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately.  For further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer to  the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be published  shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT COF's ratings continue to be supported by good earnings performance which has  remained above the average of its large regional peer group.  This is largely  due to COF's comparatively higher net interest margin (NIM) given the company's  higher yielding asset mix compared to peer banks.  Fitch believes COF's good  cost structure has also helped to support earnings. This strength in earnings has, in part, been also boosted by modest quarterly  reserve releases.  Fitch would also note that COF's earnings have been noisy  given merger costs and purchase accounting adjustments impacting results over  the last couple of years.  Nevertheless, earnings remain above peer banks and  are a rating strength of COF. Fitch also views favourably the continued evolution of COF's funding profile,  which over the last several years has moved from one almost entirely reliant on  wholesale borrowings to now being almost entirely reliant on core deposit  funding.  This evolution has been achieved primarily via acquisition, with the  latest having been the ING Direct USA acquisition in 2011.  Additionally, this evolution of COF's funding profile is one of the reasons  ratings have remained largely stable through the credit crisis and subsequently. While Fitch would note that COF's capital ratios are near the average of its  large regional peer group. This is given COF's ability to accrete capital via  growth in retained earnings more quickly than peers due to its earnings power  noted above helps to offset the lower capital ratios. Given the challenging growth environment for COF--and the rest of the banking  industry--COF has been returning a significant portion of earnings to  shareholders via constant dividends and higher buybacks.  Fitch expects this to  continue over a near-term time horizon. COF's credit quality metrics--as well as those for the rest of the  industry--have continued to improve. Fitch believes they are likely at or near a  cyclical trough.  As such, Fitch would expect some deterioration in credit  metrics going forward particularly as competition in auto lending and commercial  & industrial (C&I;) lending--two of COF's main businesses--continues to  intensify. Today's rating action encompasses this potential and expected credit  deterioration.  Additionally, Fitch would expect COF's credit metrics to be  above industry averages given its asset and customer mix, which is partially  offset in Fitch's mind by the higher yield (discussed above) earned on those  assets. Finally, Fitch notes that COF's interest rate risk positioning is relatively  neutral, which Fitch views positively from a credit perspective.  That said, it  remains to be seen if banks such as COF with large online banking platforms  experience materially higher deposit repricing (deposit beta) pressures than  those banks with checking and savings deposits originated out of branches. Should the deposit repricing pressure be higher than forecast, it could diminish  the company's asset sensitivity in a rising short-term rate environment should  that ever occur.  While this is a risk that is slightly unclear right now, Fitch  does not believe it is a ratings factor at this juncture. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch's ratings on COF have remained largely stable through the credit crisis  and subsequently. Fitch continues to believe that COF's ratings are well  situated relative to the company's large regional peer group. Fitch believes there is likely only modest upwards rating potential for COF's  ratings. From a creditor's perspective, given COF's concentrated loan portfolio in credit  cards relative to higher rated peers, Fitch would expect capital ratios to be  higher than peer group averages.  While the superior earnings generation noted  above helps to offset this at COF's current rating level, for upwards rating  momentum COF would need to have a consistently more diversified loan portfolio  or to run a higher capital ratios. Alternatively, should COF's asset quality metrics deteriorate faster than  industry averages or should funding costs (discussed above) accelerate at a rate  faster than industry averages, there could be some negative pressure on ratings  or the Rating Outlook over a medium-to-longer term time horizon. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   COF's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should COF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. That  said, Fitch views this as unlikely though for COF given the strength of the  holding company liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that COF may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  COF has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, COF is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  COF's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by COF and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from COF or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by COF and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in COF's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of COF's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of the  subsidiary banks are equalized across the group.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalised with those of COF to reflect  support from their ultimate parent. As such, they are sensitive to changes in  the parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not  expect, or from changes in COF's IDRs.  To the extent that one of COF's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from COF's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS COF's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by COF and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in COF's long- and short-term IDRs.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Capital One Financial Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Senior Shelf at 'A-' --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+';  --Preferred stock at 'BB'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.

207,COF,Fitch: Improving Growth in Capital One's 3Q'14 Earnings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 17 (Fitch) Capital One Financial's (COF) third quarter 2014  (3Q'14) earnings were down from both the sequential and year-ago quarters,  though in Fitch Ratings' opinion remained good, with the company generating a  1.50% return on average assets (ROA).  Additionally, the company's loan growth  moderately picked up as well. The company's earnings were down to somewhat higher provision expense related to  the company's loan growth noted above as well as higher marketing expenses on  the quarter.  The higher marketing spend likely helped drive some of the  company's growth.  Partially offsetting these higher expenses was the benefit  from a modestly higher net interest margin (NIM) given some mix shift away from  home loans and toward auto and card loans. COF's overall loans grew 2% from the sequential quarter and 5% from the year-ago  quarter, inclusive of the continued run-off of the company's legacy acquired  mortgage loans.  The primary loan growth areas continued to be in domestic  credit card, auto loans, as well as both traditional commercial and industrial  (C&I;) and commercial real estate (CRE) lending. This higher growth largely was the reason for the increase in provision  expenses, which increased by $289 million or 41% from the sequential quarter.   This follows the company having more modest provisioning and some reserve  releases in prior quarters. While credit quality, on balance, continues to be good and likely at or near a  cyclical trough there was an uptick related to auto loan net charge-offs (NCO)  and retail loan NCOs relative to the sequential quarter.  That said, compared to  the year-ago quarter the NCO rates in these lending categories was relatively  flat. Fitch continues to believe that over time credit quality for COF as well as the  rest of the industry will begin to deteriorate as current asset quality trends  are likely unsustainable. COF's deposit balances remained relatively stable during the period with the  average cost of deposits also relatively stable.  Fitch continues to view  favorably the transformation of COF's funding profile away from wholesale  funding and towards deposit funding over the last several years. Fitch considers COF's capital ratios to be good.  The company's Basel III Common  Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the Advanced Approach, COF's binding  constraint, remains above 8%.  This combined with the company's solid earnings  generation helps to support the company's ratings and offset some of the  consumer-related concentration risk in the loan portfolio. Additionally, Fitch would expect COF to continue to execute on its buyback  program over the balance of the year.

208,COF,Capital One's subprime auto business comes under government scrutiny,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp said it had received a subpoena from the New York district attorney’s office about its subprime auto finance practices.  The McLean, Virginia-based company made the disclosure late on Monday in a quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Its shares fell less than 1 percent on Tuesday.

211,COF,Capital One profit misses estimates due to higher loan reserves,"(Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), one of the largest credit card issuers in the United States, reported a quarterly profit that narrowly missed Wall Street’s estimates as the company set aside more money to cover bad loans. The payment services provider set aside $1.11 billion to cover bad loans in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, up nearly 16 percent from a year earlier. Net income attributable to the company’s shareholders rose to $974 million, or $1.73 per share, from $835 million, or $1.43 per share.  Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.74 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/. The company, which also offers commercial banking services, said total non-interest expense rose 2 percent in the quarter, mainly due to a 19 percent jump in marketing costs. Rival Discover Financial Services Inc (DFS.N) also reported on Wednesday that quarterly profit missed markets estimates as it set aside more money to cover soured loans.  Larger rival American Express Co (AXP.N) also said on Wednesday that its provisions for bad loans rose, but reported a higher quarterly profit, helped by rising use of its credit cards.  Capital One’s shares fell 0.6 percent to $75.75 in extended trading on Thursday, after closing at $76.20 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

214,COF,Fitch: Good Credit Card Loan Growth in Capital One's 4Q'14 Earnings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 23 (Fitch) Capital One Financial's (COF) fourth quarter  earnings were satisfactory, according to Fitch Ratings. The company's return on  average assets (ROA) clocked in at 1.27%, lower than the sequential quarter, but  an improvement relative to the year-ago quarter. Similarly the company's return  on average equity (ROE) was 8.61%, down from 10.12% in the sequential quarter,  but up from 8.27% in the year-ago quarter. Fitch notes that this result is below the company's long-term averages. This  quarter's ROE was impacted in particular by higher provision expense related to  the company's loan growth as well as higher expenses due in large part to higher  marketing expenses. That said, the higher marketing expense likely helped drive  some loan growth on the quarter. COF's net interest margin (NIM) improved to 6.81% in 4Q'14 due to a higher mix  of credit card receivables in the loan portfolio due to some credit card loan  growth as well as the continued run-off of acquired home loans. Should loan  growth continue, Fitch would expect this to continue as long as card receivables  continue to expand at a similar or greater rate. As noted, loan growth was a bright spot for COF. Total loans grew 3% and 6%  relative to the sequential and year-ago quarters respectively. In particular,  credit card loans (both domestic and international) grew 7% relative to the  sequential quarter and 6% relative to the year-ago quarter. Similarly, auto  loans grew 4% relative to the sequential quarter and 19% relative to the year  ago quarter, as COF continue to move up into the prime auto lending space. However, the loan growth was largely offset by a 4% sequential decline in home  loan and a 15% decline in home loans on a year-over-year basis. Fitch would  expect home loans to continue running off. Fitch notes that COF's overall credit quality remains at or near a cyclical  trough. This is particularly true in auto lending, credit card lending, as well  as commercial lending. Fitch would expect some reversion in COF's -- as well as  the rest of the industry's -- credit metrics over time. In Fitch's opinion the company's funding profile remains good, and has continued  to evolve towards a higher reliance on deposit funding and away from wholesale  funding over the last several years. Total deposits now constitute nearly 78% of  total liabilities. Fitch considers COF's capital ratios to be good. The company's Basel III Common  Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the advanced approach, COF's binding  constraint, remains above 8%. This combined with continued good earnings  performance helps to support the company's ratings and offset some of the  consumer-related concentration risk in the loan portfolio.

215,COF,American Express card rules violated U.S. antitrust law - judge,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co violated U.S. antitrust law by prohibiting merchants from steering consumers to use lower-cost credit cards, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, in the company’s second major setback this month. The decision by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn followed American Express’ loss on Feb. 12 of a lucrative, exclusive partnership with warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. It is also a victory for the U.S. government and 17 states, which in 2010 sued American Express over allegations it forbade merchants from recommending to consumers which cards to use. The New York-based company’s activities “imposed actual, concrete harms on competition in the credit and charge card network services market,” Garaufis wrote in a 150-page decision. He said he will decide on remedies later. American Express shares fell 1.7 percent. Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the government said. Those fees have also spurred many years of litigation by the merchants themselves against the card companies. “Today’s decision is a triumph for fair competition and for American consumers,” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. “By recognizing that American Express’s rules harm competition, the court vindicates the promise of robust marketplaces that is enshrined in our antitrust laws.” American Express said it will appeal, and that Garaufis’ decision would harm competition by “further entrenching the two dominant payment networks,” Visa and MasterCard. “We believe that freedom of choice and fair competition are worth defending,” American Express said. Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had also been sued by the various governments over their “anti-steering” rules for merchants, but settled in 2011 by agreeing to make changes. “Large retailers can save a good chunk of money by encouraging customers to use cards like Visa and MasterCard,” said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, an online marketplace. “If a large retailer can go from paying 5 percent on a transaction to even 4 percent, that is a lot.” American Express has said its “premium” services justify its processing fees, which are higher than some rivals charge. It also said its merchant rules help it compete with Visa and MasterCard, which together have more than 1.1 billion cards in the United States versus 55 million for American Express. Garaufis, however, said American Express wrongfully exploited its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market by banning merchants from giving incentives for consumers to use one card over another, or telling consumers they might be better off if they did. “There is nothing to offset credit card networks’ incentives - including American Express’s incentive - to charge merchants inflated prices for their services,” the judge wrote. “This, in turn, results in higher costs to all consumers who purchase goods and services from these merchants.” Douglas Kantor, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who represents the National Association of Convenience Stores,  welcomed the decision. “It ought to open up the marketplace for more price competition where there isn’t any at all today,” he said in an interview. “That helps merchants and consumers, because it can help keep prices down, and spur spending and economic activity.” Richard Dagen, an antitrust partner at Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider, said the decision may make it easier for small or new rivals to compete with American Express, Visa and MasterCard. “You might have a chance for someone like Discover to make inroads,” he said, referring to Discover Financial Services . “Whenever that happens, you’re likely to see lower prices for the merchants, which hopefully get passed on to consumers.” Garaufis ruled after presiding over a seven-week non-jury trial last summer. The lawsuit sought to force American Express to give merchants who accept its cards the freedom to encourage consumers “to use any payment method they choose.” No money damages were sought, but American Express has said a loss could have a “material adverse effect” on its business. That could add to the loss of earnings stemming from the demise of its partnership with Costco, which began in 1999 and will end in March 2016. American Express is the only credit payment form accepted at Costco’s U.S. stores. Costco last year decided to replace American Express as its card partner in Canada with MasterCard and Capital One Financial Corp. Shares of American Express closed down $1.38 at $78.40. Visa fell 2 cents to $269.10, and MasterCard rose $1.47 to $89.20. The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al.

216,COF,Fitch: Steady 1Q15 Earnings For Capital One,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 24 (Fitch) Capital One Financial Corporation's (COF) first  quarter 2015 (1Q15) earnings of $1.12 billion were good, in Fitch Ratings's  view. These results equated to a 1.47% return on average assets (ROAA) in 1Q15,  stronger than the 1.28% ROAA in the sequential quarter, but slightly lower than  the 1.53% ROAA in the year-ago quarter. Fitch notes that COF's earnings performance this quarter puts it near the top of  its regional bank peer group in 1Q15 from an ROAA perspective. Provision expense was a significant driver of COF's earnings this quarter, as  well as in the sequential and year-ago quarters. Relative to the sequential  quarter COF's provision expense declined by $174 million due to better than  expected credit quality, particularly in credit card lending as well as  relatively static overall loan balances. Relative to the year-ago quarter  provision expense was $200 million higher in 1Q15 primarily due to higher loan  balances in 1Q15 relative to the year-ago quarter. As noted, overall credit quality metrics were generally better in 1Q15 than in  the sequential or year-ago quarters, in part supported by improving economic  conditions. The credit quality improvements were particularly true in the card  portfolio, where credit performance continues to be better than expectations. In  the commercial portfolio credit performance continues to be excellent and  stable.  There was some modest deterioration in the auto portfolio, which was not  unexpected given the competitive dynamics of that market, but it still remains  good. Fitch would expect further deterioration in auto loan credit metrics over  time. Fitch notes that it continues to believe that credit quality for COF as well as  the rest of the industry is at or near a cyclical trough, and Fitch expects some  reversion in overall credit metrics over a medium term time horizon. Fitch notes that COF's liquidity position is good and continues to evolve. While  deposit growth has begun to moderate, total deposits in 1Q15 still increased by  2% relative to the sequential quarter and 1% relative to the year-ago quarter.  The company's loan-to-deposit ratio clocked in at 97%, which is satisfactory,  but higher than some peer institutions. As the company continues to gather  deposits, Fitch would expect this ratio to modestly improve (decline) further  over time. Additionally, Fitch believes the company to be in early compliance with the  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) as well. COF's transitionally phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under  the standardized approach was 12.5%, and under the advanced approaches remained  above 8%. Fitch continues to note that while COF's capital ratios have  historically been below those of peers, the company's stronger than peer capital  generation helps offset the lower ratios.

219,COF,Exclusive: Capital One nears deal to acquire GE health finance unit - sources,"(Reuters) - Credit card lender Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) is in exclusive talks to acquire General Electric Co’s (GE.N) U.S. healthcare finance unit, in a deal likely to top $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The potential deal could bulk up Capital One’s existing healthcare lending operations and bring GE one step closer to achieving its target of shedding about $200 billion worth of finance assets to focus on industrial manufacturing. Capital One has outbid other potential buyers in an auction for the unit, the people said on Thursday, cautioning that the negotiations are ongoing and that a deal has not yet been finalized. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Capital One and GE did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The healthcare finance unit offers direct loans to healthcare product and services companies as well as real estate loans to operators of assisted living facilities, nursing homes and medical practices. The size of GE’s finance arm and the potential risk stemming from its lending portfolio has made it subject to government oversight. GE plans to apply next year to escape its designation as a systemically important financial institution following the finance asset sales. To date, GE has announced several deals as it advances with its initiative to refocus on its industrial roots. In April, the Stamford, Connecticut-based company agreed to sell about $26 billion of real estate assets to Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Blackstone (BX.N).  Subsequently, GE Capital agreed to sell its private equity lending portfolio to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $12 billion. GE has also sold its vehicle fleet management arm in the United States, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand to Canada’s Element Financial (EFN.TO) for $6.9 billion.

221,COF,UPDATE 2-GE to sell healthcare finance business to Capital One for $9 bln,"* Deal includes healthcare-related loans worth $8.5 bln * Transaction expected to close in Q4 * GE has now announced finance asset sales of $78 bln   (Adds details, background, shares) By Neha Dimri and Anil D’Silva Aug 11 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said it would sell its U.S. healthcare finance unit to credit card lender Capital One Financial Corp for about $9 billion as it winds down its finance arm and returns to its industrial roots. The deal, which includes the sale of healthcare-related loans worth $8.5 billion, brings GE one step closer to achieving its target of shedding about $100 billion worth of finance assets by the end of this year. The latest sale, expected to close in the fourth quarter, will take GE’s announced divestitures of finance assets to about $78 billion. Reuters reported last week that Capital One was in exclusive talks to acquire GE’s healthcare finance unit and that it had outbid other potential buyers in an auction for the unit. The size of GE’s finance arm - GE Capital - and the potential risk stemming from its lending portfolio has made it subject to government oversight. GE plans to apply next year to escape its designation as a systemically important financial institution following the sale of finance assets. For Capital One, the deal will bolster its healthcare lending operations. “This addition will catapult us to a leading market position in providing financial services to the healthcare sector,” said Michael Slocum, president of Capital One’s Commercial Bank. GE’s healthcare finance unit offers direct loans to healthcare product and services companies as well as real estate loans to operators of assisted living facilities, nursing homes and medical practices. GE also said on Tuesday it agreed to sell about $600 million of the unit’s real estate equity investments to another buyer, which it did not name. In April, GE agreed to sell about $26 billion of real estate assets to Wells Fargo & Co and Blackstone Group LP . Subsequently, GE agreed to sell its private equity lending portfolio to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $12 billion. Citigroup Global Markets and J.P.

223,COF,Capital One wins again against Intellectual Ventures patents,"(Reuters) - The increasingly aggressive litigation strategy of Intellectual Ventures, one of the world’s biggest patent owners, took another hit on Wednesday as a U.S. court canceled two of its patents in a dispute with Capital One Financial Corp. U.S. District Judge Paul Grimm in Greenbelt, Maryland, agreed with Capital One’s attorneys from Latham & Watkins that the two patents related to business data processing were merely abstract ideas and could not be patented.

226,COF,Fitch Affirms Capital One Financial Corp's LT IDR at 'A-' Following Large Regional Bank Review,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Capital One Financial  Corporation's (COF) ratings at 'A-/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T; Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T; Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of COF's ratings continues to be supported by strong earnings  performance, which over time has remained above the average of its large  regional peer group. In Fitch's view, this is largely driven by COF's  comparatively higher net interest margin, given the company's comparatively  higher yielding asset mix relative to peer banks. This has also been boosted by  higher interchange revenue over the last year, as COF has benefited from higher  purchase volumes from its customer base. COF also boasts a relatively good efficiency ratio relative to peer banks which  has also helped to support its earnings performance. While COF's 2Q15 earnings  were impacted by a large restructuring charge, the charge was primarily due to  management's efficiency initiatives, which are focused on making the company a  more digitally driven enterprise. Over time, Fitch believes this strategy will  contribute to making COF's business model more scalable and therefore help  maintain its strong earnings performance. Fitch views COF's capital ratios as near the average of some peer banks.  However, given COF's ability to accrete capital via growth in retained earnings  more quickly than some peers due to the earnings power noted above helps to  provide a buffer to these ratios. Fitch believes the long-term evolution of COF's funding profile to be supportive  to today's rating action. Over the last several years, COF has moved away from a  business model almost entirely reliant on wholesale borrowings and  securitizations to one being almost entirely reliant on core deposit funding via  a mix of organic deposit growth and acquisitions. Although COF has a combination of traditional branch banking deposits and  internet based deposits, COF's internet deposit platform allows the company to  offer more competitive deposit rates than others who rely more heavily on a more  expensive branch based distribution model. It remains to be seen how deposit  re-pricing (deposit beta) dynamics will evolve in a rising interest rate  environment for banks like COF that rely more heavily on technology based  distribution model. To the extent that the deposit re-pricing dynamics are more  intense, it could make the company's interest rate sensitivity more muted over a  medium to longer-term time horizon. Credit quality for COF (as well as the rest of the industry) has generally  continued to improve, and Fitch believes is likely at or near a cyclical trough.  Fitch would expect some deterioration in credit metrics going forward, which is  incorporated in today's rating action. Fitch believes the potential for some credit deterioration is more prevalent in  the company's auto loan portfolio, where competition continues to intensify  particularly as some auto-manufacturer owned lenders become more aggressive in  the space. Additionally, areas Fitch is watching for deterioration include COF's  taxi medallion lending portfolio and its energy loan portfolio.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES COF's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a-' for loss  severity. COF's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due  to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Capital One Bank (USA), National Association  (COBNA), Capital One National Association (CONA), and Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B.  are rated one-notch higher than COF's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S.  uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference  gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  COF's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. The ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The VRs of COBNA and CONA are equalized with COF's VR reflecting Fitch's view  that it is core to COF's business strategy and financial profile.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR COF has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, COF is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT COF's ratings have remained largely stable over the last several years and are  well situated relative to its peer group. Fitch believes there is likely only modest upwards rating potential for COF's  ratings at this time. From a creditor's perspective COF's loan portfolio is more  concentrated in credit cards and other consumer assets relative to higher rated  peer institutions. In order for some upward rating momentum to build, Fitch  believes COF would need to develop a more diversified loan portfolio at a  measured pace with evidence of strong underwriting discipline and appropriate  risk controls to manage the diversification, all of which may take some time to  eventuate to the extent it ever does. Alternatively, should COF's asset quality metrics deteriorate faster than  industry averages or should funding costs accelerate at a rate faster than  industry averages there could be some negative pressure on ratings or the Rating  Outlook over a medium to longer term time horizon. Additionally, while Fitch views favorably management's strategy of transforming  COF into an even more digitally driven enterprise as it should enhance the  company's economies of scale, to the extent that this also makes the company  more reliant on technology it has the potential to increase some elements of  operational risk. While not anticipated, if a large operational loss were to  occur, Fitch would review COF's ratings at that time to determine if a negative  action were appropriate. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for COF and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to COF's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to COF's  long-and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should COF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of COF to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in COF's IDRs.  To the extent that one of COF's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from COF's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since COF's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.

227,COF,"Fitch: Good, Relatively Clean Quarter for Capital One","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 23 (Fitch) Capital One Financial Corporation's (COF) third  quarter 2015 (3Q15) earnings were relatively good as the company delivered a  1.43% return on average assets (ROAA), up from the sequential quarter which was  impacted by a large restructuring charge, but down 8 basis points from the  year-ago quarter. Similarly, return on average equity (ROAE) was 9.54% for 3Q15, up from 7.30%  sequentially, but down from 10.12% year over year.  While Fitch considers this a  good result, it is also below our range of estimates for the company's long-term  cost of equity assumption. It is noteworthy that this quarter also included a $69 million build of  litigation reserves relative to the company's U.K. Payment Protection Insurance  (PPI) reserve.  The build last quarter was $78 million.  For the industry, PPI  insurance was supposed to cover a consumer's debt payments if they were not  employed, but in many cases these policies were alleged to have been mis-sold  and are now creating a liability for the sellers. COF's total net revenue expanded 4% sequentially and 5% from the year over year.  This was the result of higher net interest income (NII) in 3Q15 relative to both  periods, as non-interest income was flat relative to both periods. The NII growth was due to higher loan balances, largely the result of growth in  domestic credit card receivables, which grew 4% sequentially and 12% year over  year.   As the company continues to run-off its legacy acquired mortgage loans, the  growth in the higher yield card receivables noted above as well as one extra day  in the quarter helped to push up the company's net interest margin (NIM), which  ticked up to 6.73% in 3Q15, versus 6.56% sequentially quarter and 6.69% year  over year.   It is noteworthy that COF's purchase volume was up strongly again, climbing 2%  sequentially and 22% year over year.  However, despite this strong purchase  volume, net interchange fees were down 2% sequentially and only up 6% year over  year. Fitch believes much of the interchange generated from purchase volume continues  to fund rewards programs.  Across the industry the competition related to  customer rewards programs remains high.  Fitch believes that this dynamic helped  keep non-interest income flat. Overall non-interest expense was down 4% sequentially, but up 6% year over year.  Given the revenue growth as well as the reasonably good expense management the  efficiency ratio improved to 53.56% in 3Q15.  While Fitch expects management to  remain vigilant on expenses through the balance of the year and into 2016, we  believe the efficiency ratio may modestly tick-up. Overall provision expense was $1.09 billion, down 3% sequentially but up 10%  year over year.   Compared to 2Q15, the story is mixed, with lower provisioning in credit cards  due to still better-than-expected credit performance partially offset by higher  provisioning in the company's commercial portfolio, which has been impacted by  weakness in COF's taxi medallion portfolio and energy lending portfolio. The growth in provision relative to a year ago was due to growth in overall card  balances, growth in auto balances, and the modest credit deterioration in the  commercial portfolios noted above. Despite some of the issues in the commercial portfolio, overall credit metrics  remain good with an overall net charge-off (NCO) rate of 2.96%.  In addition,  the commercial portfolio's the non-performing loan rate was 0.87%, higher versus  the year-ago period, but still a good result. Fitch continues to believe that overall credit metrics for COF - as well as the  rest of the industry - remain near a cyclical trough and would expect some  reversion in credit metrics over time.  Other than the aforementioned areas in  COF's commercial portfolio, we are also cautious on some eventual deterioration  auto loans for COF as well as the rest of the industry.   COF's liquidity position is good and continues to evolve. While deposit growth  has begun to moderate, total deposits in 3Q15 still increased by 1% sequentially  and 3% year over year.  The company's loan-to-deposit ratio ticked up to 100%, which is higher than some  peer institutions. During the quarter, COF used some wholesale funding as well  as deposits to fund its loan growth.  Over time, as COF continues to gather  deposits, Fitch would expect this ratio to modestly improve (i.e. to decline). Additionally, Fitch believes the company to be in early compliance with the  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) as well. COF's transitionally phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under  the standardized approach was 12.1%, and under the advanced approaches remained  above 8%.

228,COF,U.S. jury finds ex-Capital One analyst liable in insider trading case,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - A former Capital One Financial Corp analyst was found liable on Wednesday on civil charges that he engaged in insider trading by using non-public sales data from the credit card issuer to buy and sell stocks. A federal jury in Philadelphia agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that information used by the Capital One ex-employee, Nan Huang, to trade in shares of consumer retail companies ahead of sales and earnings reports was “material.”  The data gave Huang, who earned nearly $1.5 million from the trades, a “significant advantage” over the investing public, SEC lawyers said. The verdict marked a victory for the SEC, which has recently suffered a series of trial losses in insider trading cases, most notably the 2013 verdict clearing billionaire Mark Cuban. Huang did not deny using Capital One’s non-public information, which the company’s policies forbid. The case hinged on whether the sales data was “material,” or gave Huang a significant edge compared to the scope of other information available to the investing public. The sales information met that definition because, in part, Huang used it to make “calculations that allowed him to project and predict” broader sales patterns for the companies, said SEC lawyer David Axelrod in closing arguments on Wednesday. “Obviously, we are disappointed in the verdict,” said Gregory Morvillo, Huang’s New York-based lawyer. “We have a fundamental disagreement with the SEC as to materiality, not just as applicable to the facts in this case, but as a matter of law,” Morvillo said in an email to Reuters. Penalties for Huang, who did not testify, were not immediately clear, but are likely to include a fine and requirement that he return wrongfully earned profits. Lawyers debated on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Mark Kearney how to calculate those profits. Kearney will rule on penalties in a separate order. The SEC sued colleagues Nan Huang and Bonan Huang in January 2015 alleging they made hundreds, if not thousands, of keyword searches on their company’s private database for sales data on at least 170 publicly traded companies from November 2013 to January 2015. According to the SEC, the analysts, both Virginia residents when they worked for Capital One used the information to trade in accounts at numerous brokerages ahead of quarterly sales announcements by the companies. The Huangs, who are not related, began with a $147,000 investment and together made more than $2.8 million from the trades, a three-year return of 1,819 percent, the SEC said. Bonan Huang settled with the SEC last month, agreeing to more than $4.7 million in penalties and other payments without admitting or denying the allegations. Both Huangs, who investigated potential credit card frauds for Capital One, are Chinese nationals. They fled to China shortly after Capital One fired them last year, where they remain.

232,COF,U.S. jury finds ex-Capital One analyst liable in insider trading case,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - A former Capital One Financial Corp  analyst was found liable on Wednesday on civil charges that he engaged in insider trading by using non-public sales data from the credit card issuer to buy and sell stocks. A federal jury in Philadelphia agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that information used by the Capital One ex-employee, Nan Huang, to trade in shares of consumer retail companies ahead of sales and earnings reports was “material.” The data gave Huang, who earned nearly $1.5 million from the trades, a “significant advantage” over the investing public, SEC lawyers said. The verdict marked a victory for the SEC, which has  suffered a number of trial losses in insider trading cases during recent years, most notably the 2013 verdict clearing billionaire Mark Cuban. The SEC won 23 of 25 trials involving various securities violations during its 2015 fiscal year. In September, however, a former Wells Fargo & Co trader was cleared of insider trading charges. Huang did not deny using Capital One’s non-public information, which the company’s policies forbid. The case hinged on whether the sales data was “material,” or gave Huang a significant edge compared to the scope of other information available to the investing public. The sales information met that definition because, in part, Huang used it to make “calculations that allowed him to project and predict” broader company sales patterns, said SEC lawyer David Axelrod in closing arguments on Wednesday. “Obviously, we are disappointed in the verdict,” said Gregory Morvillo, Huang’s New York-based lawyer. “We have a fundamental disagreement with the SEC as to materiality, not just as applicable to the facts in this case, but as a matter of law,” Morvillo said in an email to Reuters. Penalties for Huang, who did not testify, were not immediately clear, but are likely to include a fine and requirement that he return wrongfully earned profits. Lawyers debated on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Mark Kearney how to calculate those profits. Kearney will rule on penalties in a separate order. The SEC sued colleagues Nan Huang and Bonan Huang in January 2015 alleging they made hundreds, if not thousands, of keyword searches on their company’s private database for sales data on at least 170 publicly traded companies from November 2013 to January 2015. According to the SEC, the analysts, both Virginia residents when they worked for Capital One used the information to trade in accounts at numerous brokerages ahead of quarterly sales announcements by the companies. The Huangs, who are not related, began with a $147,000 investment and together made more than $2.8 million from the trades, a three-year return of 1,819 percent, the SEC said.

234,COF,Fitch: Capital One's 4Q15 Earnings Down on Higher Provisioning,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 28 (Fitch) Capital One's Financial Corporation's (COF) fourth  quarter 2015 (4Q15) earnings were down due to higher provisioning and some  higher marketing expenses.  The company's overall return on average assets (ROAA) was 1.12% in 4Q15, still a  good result relative to peers but down from 1.43% in the sequential quarter and  1.28% in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, the company's return on average equity (ROE) was 7.36% in 4Q15, down  from 9.54% in the sequential quarter and 8.61% in the year-ago quarter. These  results are below Fitch's estimated range of a cost of equity assumption for COF  of between 10% to 12%. Provision expense for COF increased 26% from the sequential quarter and 24% from  the year-ago quarter. This was due to a number of factors including continued  growth in credit card receivables and auto loans. Provision expense this quarter  also included the impact of higher provisioning in the company's energy loan  portfolio as oil prices continue to decline. That said, the company's energy  loan exposure of $3.1 billion represents only 1.3% of total loans as of 4Q15. COF's marketing expense also increased by 35% relative to the sequential quarter  and 11% from the year-ago quarter, but Fitch notes that this did help drive  higher card balances and purchase volumes during the quarter. Fitch believes  this is a lever management will episodically dial up and down based on market  opportunities. The company also completed its acquisition of GE's healthcare lending business  in December 2015, which boosted ending commercial loans by $8.3 billion, which  also drove $49 million of provision to bring on the new loans and $20 million of  operating expense from deal close costs. Notwithstanding some of the drivers of higher overall expenses noted above, the  company's total revenue increased 5% from the sequential quarter and 11% from  the year-ago quarter.  Net interest income (NII) continues to expand due largely to higher loan  balances during the quarter. In addition, the company's net interest margin  (NIM) in 4Q15 ticked up modestly to 6.79% as there was some mix shift with  lower-yielding mortgages being replaced by higher-yield card and auto loans. Non-interest income was up 5% from the sequential quarter and 7% from the  year-ago quarter due largely to higher purchase volumes which drove net  interchange revenue higher on the quarter. Purchase volume was up 8% relative to  the sequential quarter and 19% relative to the year-ago quarter. Fitch notes that COF's purchase volume growth outpaced growth in credit card  receivables, indicating the possibility that its customer base is skewing more  towards transactional-oriented customers rather than those who maintain  revolving balances. COF's liquidity position is good and continues to evolve. While deposit growth  has begun to moderate, total deposits in 4Q15 still grew by 2% relative to the  sequential quarter and 5% relative to the year-ago quarter.  The company's loan-to-deposit ratio ticked up to 102%, which is higher than that  of some peer institutions. During the quarter, COF used some wholesale funding  as well as deposits to fund its loan growth. Over time, as COF continues to  gather deposits, Fitch would expect this ratio to modestly improve (i.e.  decline). Fitch believes the company to be in early compliance with the Liquidity Coverage  Ratio (LCR) as well. COF's transitionally phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under  the standardized approach was 11.1% down from 12.1% in the sequential quarter  due in part to the GE Healthcare transaction which closed in December 2015.  Under the advanced approaches, COF's Basel III CET1 ratio remained above 8%.  Contact: Justin Fuller, CFA Senior Director  +1-312-368-5472 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

235,COF,Former analyst for Capital One must pay $13.5 million for insider trading: SEC,"(Reuters) - A former Capital One Financial Corp analyst was ordered by a federal court in Philadelphia to pay $13.5 million in sanctions for insider trading, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday. The ex-analyst, Nan Huang, was found liable in January in a civil trial of using non-public sales data from Capital One, a credit card issuer, to buy and sell stocks. “Obviously, we’re disappointed and we disagree with the ruling,” said Gregory Morvillo, Huang’s New York-based lawyer. “We will be considering our options over the coming days,” Morvillo said. The $13.5 million sanction requires Huang to return $4.4 million in profits he made from the illicit trading to the SEC. He must also pay an additional penalty of double that amount, or $8.8 million, according to an opinion by U.S. District Judge Mark Kearney in Philadelphia on Thursday. Huang’s legal arguments were “unpersuasive,” Kearney wrote. Huang had argued that information he obtained from a non-public database while working as a credit card fraud analyst for Capital One, was “not material” compared with the scope of information available to average investors, such as publicly available stock research reports. The SEC sued colleagues Nan Huang and Bonan Huang in January 2015 alleging they made hundreds, if not thousands, of keyword searches on their company’s private database for sales data on at least 170 publicly traded companies from November 2013 to January 2015.

237,COF,Fitch: Energy Provisioning Weighs on Capital One's 1Q16 Earnings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 28 (Fitch) Capital One Financial Corporation's (COF) first  quarter 2016 (1Q16) earnings were down due to higher provisioning across its  platform, but particularly within the company's energy loan portfolio, according  to Fitch Ratings. COF's overall return on average assets (ROAA) was a still good 1.23% in 1Q16  relative to 1.12% in the sequential quarter and 1.47% in the year-ago quarter.   Fitch notes that the 1Q16 ROAA still compares favorably to many regional bank  peers during the quarter. However, the company's annualized return on average  equity (ROE) during 1Q16 was 8.52%, which is below Fitch's estimate range of a  cost of equity assumption for COF of between 10% to 12%. As noted, the main driver of COF's earnings performance this quarter was higher  provisioning.  The overall provision expense in 1Q16 was $1.53 billion due to  auto loan growth as well as incrementally higher auto loan net charge-off rates  (NCO), coupled with higher levels of criticized energy assets. Auto loans grew 3% from the sequential quarter and 10% from the year-ago  quarter.  NCO rates in auto loans were 1.60% in 1Q16, and management expects  this to increase gradually.  Additionally, there was some evidence of used car  values declining during the quarter which also helped to push up the allowance. Within the energy portfolio both criticized assets and non-performing assets  increased in 1Q16, and as a result COF boosted the allowance for loan losses in  the energy portfolio. The total allowance for energy related loans is now $262  million as of the end of 1Q16, which represents 8.15% of loans held for  investment, which Fitch considers reasonable, though below the level of some  peers. To put COF's energy exposure in context, despite some customer draws on their  lines of credit in 1Q16, total oil and gas loans ended the quarter at $3.2  billion, at only 1.5% of total company loans and 6.3% of total equity.  COF's  unfunded energy exposure decreased to $2.7 billion due to the customer draws  noted above as well as some reductions in borrowing bases. Fitch continues to view COF's energy exposure to be manageable within the  context of the company's earnings performance. Total revenue for COF excluding provisions was flat relative to the sequential  quarter but up 10% relative to the year-ago quarter.  This was due to higher net  interest income (NII) given higher loan balances due in part to the closing of  the GE Healthcare transaction as well as continued growth in credit card loans.   It was surprising that COF did not benefit more from the Federal Reserve's  interest rate increase in the latter part of 2015, as the company's interest  costs modestly ticked up on wholesale borrowings while overall asset yields  remained steady.  This asset yield impact was largely due to mix changes given  the closing of the GE Healthcare transaction.  As such, the net interest margin  (NIM) ticked down 4 basis points relative to the sequential quarter to 6.75% at  the end of 1Q16. Non-interest income was down relative to the sequential quarter but up relative  to the year-ago quarter largely driven by changes in interchange net revenue.   This was not overly surprising as purchase volume seasonally declined during  1Q16 relative to the sequential quarter, but was up strongly relative to the  year-ago quarter as COF's QuickSilver and Venture cards continue to gain  traction. Non-interest expenses continue to be comparatively well controlled, as COF  demonstrated the ability to achieve positive operating leverage relative to both  the sequential and year-ago quarters.  As such, the company's efficiency ratio  remained strong at 51.82% as of the end of 1Q16. Fitch continues to consider COF's capital and liquidity positions as appropriate  for its rating category. COF's loan-to-deposit ratio was 100% which is lower than the sequential quarter,  but somewhat higher than most other regional bank peers. Additionally, the company's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio as of  the end of 1Q16 was 11.1% under the standardized approach and remains above 8%  under the advanced approach.

243,COF,Fitch: Credit Card Provisions Impact Capital One's 2Q16 Earnings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 22 (Fitch) Capital One Financial Corporation's (COF) second  quarter 2016 (2Q16) earnings were down 7% sequentially due to higher  provisioning in the company's domestic credit card portfolio and higher  operating costs, according to Fitch Ratings. COF's overall return on average assets (ROAA) was a still good 1.13% in 2Q16  relative to 1.23% in the sequential quarter and 1.11% in the year-ago quarter.   Fitch notes that the 2Q16 ROAA still compares favorably to many regional bank  peers during the quarter. However, the company's annualized return on average  equity (ROE) during 2Q16 was 7.64%, which continues to be below Fitch's  estimated cost of equity range for COF of between 10% to 12%. Provision expense was the main driver of COF's earnings performance this quarter  at $1.59 billion mainly due to an 18% sequential increase in the provision for  credit cards. This was driven by COF's ongoing loan growth in this segment as  well as higher anticipated net charge-offs (NCOs) in 2017.  Higher provisions  related to COF's taxi medallion portfolio (discussed below) also modestly  contributed to the increase. Credit card loans grew 5% from the sequential quarter and 11% from the year-ago  quarter.  NCO rates in card loans were 4.02% in 2Q16, and management expects  this to increase into the low-4s in 2017.  Additionally, COF also increased its  auto loan allowance by $58 million due to higher subprime originations and an  expected decline in used car prices from currently high levels.  COF also built an additional $60 million of reserves in its taxi medallion  financing business. This business is small for COF at $854 million of loans, but  nonperforming loans rose to 38% from 30% during the quarter. Pressure from ride  hailing applications, particularly in the Chicago market, have impacted  collateral values in this business by about 60%. Within the energy portfolio, loans decreased by 7% due to lower borrowing bases  from the spring redeterminations. Provisions were minimal after the reserve  build last quarter and the total allowance for energy related loans now stands  at 8.87% of funded exposure. This level increased moderately during the quarter  due to the decrease in loans and is roughly in line with peers. Non-performing  and criticized loans in the portfolio decreased moderately but remain elevated. To put COF's energy exposure in context, total oil and gas loans ended the  quarter at $3 billion, at only 1.3% of total company loans and 6.2% of total  equity.  COF's unfunded energy exposure decreased slightly to $2.7 billion due  to the reductions in borrowing bases noted above. Despite some signs of pressure across COF's various lending businesses, Fitch  continues to believe this is manageable for the company within the context of  its solid earnings profile. Total revenue for COF excluding provisions was up 1% relative to the sequential  quarter and up 12% relative to the year-ago quarter.  This was due to higher net  interest income (NII) given higher loan balances due in part to the closing of  the GE Healthcare transaction as well as continued growth in credit card loans.   The net interest margin (NIM) ticked down 2 basis points relative to the  sequential quarter to 6.73% at the end of 1Q16 due to high deposit costs and  weaker securities yields. Relative to the year-ago quarter it is up 17 basis  points due to the growth in the high-yielding credit card loan portfolio. Non-interest income was flat relative to the sequential quarter but up 2%  relative to the year-ago quarter largely driven by higher interchange net  revenue.  This follows trends also seen at competitors due to higher purchase  volumes and due to COF's QuickSilver and Venture cards continuing to gain  traction. Non-interest expenses continue to be comparatively well controlled, though COF  had a small uptick in growth expenses relative to the sequential quarter.  The  company's efficiency ratio remained strong at 52.7% as of the end of 2Q16. COF's loan-to-deposit ratio was 106% which is modestly higher than the  sequential quarter, and remains somewhat higher than most other regional bank  peers. Fitch continues to view COF's funding profile favorably in the context of  the shift over the past several years towards core deposit funding rather than  wholesale borrowings. Additionally, the company's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio as of  the end of 2Q16 was 10.9% under the standardized approach. The estimated CET1  ratio under the advanced approach remains above 8% and COF announced it no  longer believes this approach will be the long-term capital constraint for the  company. Fitch believes this level of capital continues to be adequate for COF's  rating category. Contact: Justin Fuller, CFA Senior Director  +1-312-368-5472 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

247,COF,Fitch Affirms Capital One Financial at 'A-/F1'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Capital One Financial  Corporation's (COF) ratings at 'A-/F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The  affirmation and Stable Outlook are driven by COF's continued solid earnings  performance, still good credit performance, and satisfactory capital ratios for  its business model.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T; Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T; Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION). Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of COF's ratings continues to be supported by good earnings  performance, which over time has remained above the average of its large  regional peer group. In Fitch's view, this is largely driven by COF's  comparatively higher net interest margin, given its proportionately larger mix  of higher yielding credit card receivables in its loan portfolio relative to  peer institutions. COF also continues to drive a strong efficiency ratio relative to peer banks  which has also helped to support its earnings performance and therefore its  ratings. Going forward Fitch expects COF to continue to have a strong efficiency  ratio given its significant investments in becoming digital in its operations  and customer interfaces. Fitch believes these investments have the potential to  more meaningfully increase scale benefits for COF relative to peer institutions  over time. Fitch continues to believe the long-term evolution of COF's funding profile is  supportive of today's rating action. Over the last several years, COF has moved  away from a business model almost entirely reliant on wholesale borrowings and  securitizations to one being more fully reliant on deposit funding via a mix of  organic deposit growth and acquisitions. While Fitch views this movement positively, COF's loan-to-deposit ratio remains  on the high-end of peer averages, routinely hovering around 100% relative to a  mid-70% average for many other peers.  Fitch views COF's capital ratios as supportive to the rating, particularly when  taken in context of the company's ability to accrete capital via growth in  retained earnings more quickly than some peers. However, Fitch believes the strength of this capital position is partially  offset by the company's higher concentration in consumer lending assets, which  encompass credit card loans, auto loans, and some installment loans. These asset  classes tend to carry higher yields but also have higher loss ratios.  While COF has worked to further balance its loan portfolio, most notably with  the acquisition of General Electric's healthcare lending business in 2015, it  still remains more concentrated than some peers. To the extent that COF  continues to prudently diversify its loan portfolio this could lead to  longer-term upside to the ratings (discussed in the ratings sensitivities  section below). Credit quality for COF (as well as the rest of the industry) has generally  continued to be good, but there is some evidence of the beginnings of a modest  reversion in certain asset classes. This reversion has already occurred in COF's  energy loan portfolio, though at $3 billion energy loans only represent 1.3% of  total company loans. Additionally, there has been some credit deterioration in  COF's relatively small taxi medallion lending portfolio, as pressure from ride  hailing applications, particularly in the Chicago market, has impacted  collateral values in this business by about 60%. However, the taxi medallion  portfolio is only approximately $854 million or 0.36% of total loans. This  deterioration has been manageable for the company in the context of its good  quarterly earnings generation. Fitch believes that some credit deterioration is likely in the company's auto  loan portfolio. Across the auto lending industry Fitch has become cautious about  the extension of loan terms as well as the potential for declines in used car  prices (e.g collateral values) over the next couple of years.  COFs auto loan portfolio has a higher proportion of loans to non-prime customers  than the auto portfolios of other peer institutions. As a result, Fitch believes  COF's auto loan portfolio will exhibit higher delinquency trends and loss rates  on a going forward relative to most other peer banks that have been more focused  on originating only prime auto loans. Fitch generally expects the potential auto loan credit deterioration to be  manageable through COF's quarterly earnings, but credit performance is expected  to be slightly worse than its peers. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  COF has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, COF is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES COF's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a-' for loss  severity. COF's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instrument's  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed  based on the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Capital One Bank (USA), National Association  (COBNA), Capital One National Association (CONA), and Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B.  are rated one-notch higher than COF's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S.  uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference  gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  COF's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. The ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The VRs of COBNA and CONA are equalized with COF's VR, reflecting Fitch's view  that it is core to COF's business strategy and financial profile.  RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch believes there may be some incremental upward rating potential for COF's  ratings over the long term if COF continues to prudently diversify its loan  portfolio to achieve a more balanced mix between consumer and commercial assets.  Further, the ratings could be upgraded one notch over time if COF achieves loan  portfolio diversification with solid asset quality performance and improved  funding more consistent with peer banks and also maintains current capital  levels.  Alternatively, should COF's asset quality metrics deteriorate faster than  industry averages and not be manageable within the context of quarterly earnings  this could pressure the ratings or Outlook. Additionally, should COF's funding  costs accelerate at a rate significantly faster than industry averages this  could also potentially result in negative ratings pressure. Fitch views very favorably management's strategy of transforming COF into an  even more digitally driven enterprise as it should help the company maintain its  efficiency ratio at better than peer averages. However, to the extent that this  also makes the company more reliant on technology than some peers, it could  potentially increase some elements of operational risk.  While not anticipated, if a large operational loss were to occur, Fitch would  review COF's ratings at that time to determine if a negative action were  appropriate. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Since COF's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for COF and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to COF's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to COF's  long- and short-term IDRs.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should COF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of COF to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in COF's IDRs.  To the extent that one of COF's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from COF's IDR.

250,COF,Fitch: Loan Growth Evident in Capital One's 3Q16 Earnings,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 26 (Fitch) Capital One Financial Corporation's (COF) third  quarter 2016 (3Q16) earnings were good and showed evidence of continued growth  in the company's domestic credit card business and auto loan business, according  to Fitch Ratings. COF's overall return on average assets (ROAA) was 1.18% in 3Q16, up from 1.13%  in the sequential quarter, but down 1.43% in the year-ago quarter. The  year-over-year decline is primarily due to higher provision expense related to  continued growth of the credit card portfolio as well as some problem assets in  the company's energy portfolio and taxi medallion portfolio as well as $63  million of costs related to a build in the U.K. Payment Protection Insurance  customer refund reserve. The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 8.59% in 3Q16 up from 7.64% in  the sequential quarter, but down from 9.54% in the year-ago quarter for the same  reasons noted above. Overall revenue growth, while improved, remains challenging  amid strong competition for card, auto, and commercial loans.  COF's balance sheet has continued to expand, growing 1.7% from the sequential  quarter and 10% from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year growth is due to  both the GE Healthcare acquisition which closed at the end of 2015 as well as  the previously noted growth in the company's large domestic credit card  portfolio, which expanded 3% relative to the sequential quarter and 11% relative  to the year-ago quarter. Fitch believes this growth in the card portfolio is due to COF's continued  efforts in marketing both its QuickSilver and Venture cards, both of which have  comparatively good rewards programs. The cost of these rewards programs have  partially offset some of the benefits to earnings from the growth noted above. COF's deposit portfolio has grown more modestly, expanding 2% from the  sequential quarter and 6% from the year-ago quarter to $226 million as of 3Q16.  Given that loans grew faster than deposits the company's loan-to-deposit ratio  remained elevated at approximately 106% as of 3Q16. COF primarily used  securitizations and modest increases in wholesale borrowing to fund the loan  growth. Given the growth in the loan portfolio, particularly as it relates to  comparatively higher yielding credit card receivables, the company's net  interest income grew 4% from the sequential quarter and 11% from the year-ago  quarter. Similarly the company's net interest margin (NIM) ticked up to a strong  6.79% in 3Q16, up from 6.73% in both the sequential and year-ago periods. While COF's purchase volume increased 12% year-over-year, total non-interest  income only grew 2% from the sequential quarter and 4% from the year-ago  quarter, as Fitch believes COF is continuing to use more of its interchange  revenue to fund its good rewards programs noted above. Total non-interest expenses for COF grew 2% from the sequential quarter and 6%  from the year-ago quarter as the company continues to manage expenses carefully  within the context of its efforts to develop digital operating platforms and  customer interfaces. Relative to both the sequential and year-ago quarters, COF  did deliver positive operating leverage and the company's efficiency ratio  ticked down to 52.02% in 3Q16. As noted provision expense increased significantly increased relative to the  year-ago quarter due to the acquisition of the GE Healthcare portfolio, growth  in credit card and auto loan receivables, and some year-over-year deterioration  the energy and taxi medallion portfolios. Relative to the sequential quarter  provision was flat as provision related to growth in the credit card and auto  loan portfolios was offset by some moderating of the energy loan portfolio. COF's overall credit quality remains good, with the company's net charge-off  (NCO) ratio ticking up modestly to 2.10% in 3Q16 which relative to the last 10  years is still low, though Fitch would note that COF's 30 day+ delinquency ratio  is up nine basis points from the prior year period, still solid compared to  historical averages. Additionally, this quarter's NCO ratio compares to 2.01% in  the sequential quarter and 1.69% in the year-ago quarter.  The up-tick was due to continued seasoning and growth in the domestic credit  card and auto loan portfolios. Fitch continues to believe credit quality in  these portfolios is around cyclical troughs, and would expect further reversion  in NCO ratios over a medium-term time horizon. As noted, in the commercial portfolio both the energy and taxi medallion  portfolios remain problematic. Given the rise in energy prices over the last  several months, there has been some moderating of the deteriorating trends in  the energy portfolio. Total energy loans are down to $5.4 billion, or 3.98% of  the total commercial portfolio, and 1.11% of the total loan portfolio. Given the  lower loan balances, the allowance was down sequentially by $22 million, but the  energy reserve coverage remains good at 9.18% of loans held for investment. COF's taxi medallion portfolio continues to see credit deterioration amid the  proliferation of ride sharing services such as Uber and Lyft. However, the  exposure remains modest at 1.16% of commercial loans and 0.32% of total loans.  The allowance for this portfolio is $111mn as of 3Q16, representing reserve  coverage of 14.32% of loans held for investment, but only 1.7% of the total  allowance. COF's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the standardized  approach as of the end of 3Q16 was 10.6% relative to 10.9% at the end of 2Q16.  The decline was attributable to some share repurchases during the quarter as  well as the balance sheet growth noted above. Similar to last quarter, COF noted  that standardized ratio will be the long-term capital constraint for the  company.

256,COF,"Capital One launches Eno, gender-neutral virtual assistant","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp has developed a “chatbot” named Eno, an automated program that can communicate with the bank’s customers via text message to give them information on their accounts and help them make credit card payments from their smartphone. Capital One’s gender-neutral virtual assistant, which is being rolled out as a pilot to a segment of its customers, uses artificial intelligence to respond to natural language text messages from users about their money, the bank said on Friday. For example, customers might ask Eno to show them their recent account balances or pay off a credit card bill.  Ken Dodelin, Capital One’s vice president of digital product development, said the bank had deliberately chosen a gender-neutral name. The predominance of female names among popular digital assistants has provoked criticism recently. Asked if it is a boy or a girl, Eno will reply that it is “binary.” Being a banker, albeit a virtual one, its favorite color is green.  In a bid to make the experience more human, Eno - whose name spells One backwards - has also been programmed to recognize certain “emojis,” the popular messaging icons. Users can prompt Eno to show them their account balance by sending the “bag of money” emoji or can confirm a payment through the “thumbs up” emoji. Chatbots and virtual assistants have risen in popularity in banking and other industries because recent improvements in artificial intelligence have made them better at interacting and interpreting human language.  Banks and other financial firms are hopeful they can be used to provide better customer service at the fraction of the cost of large call centers populated by humans.

260,COF,UPDATE 3-Synovus to buy Cabela's financial unit - source,"(Reuters) - Synovus Financial Corp (SNV.N) will buy the financial unit of outdoor goods retailer Cabela’s Inc CAB.N, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. Synovus will keep the deposits held by the unit and resell its credit-card portfolio to Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), the source said. The unit, called World’s Foremost Bank, was supposed to be bought by Capital One last year, but the deal wasn’t able to get timely regulatory approval. The unit, which provides branded credit cards, had nearly 2 million accounts with about $5 billion in loans and $502 million in revenue in 2015. Cabela’s in October last year agreed to be bought by rival Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at $5.5 billion, uniting two of the country’s largest hunting and fishing retailers. Cabela’s later said it would not be able to close its sale to Bass Pro in the first half of this year, as originally expected, because of approval delays. The Federal Trade Commission, which regulates and enforces antitrust laws, had also sought more information from the companies about the deal. Cabela’s, which derives a significant amount of its business from gun sales, attributed part of its 2016 challenges to the delayed effects of a slow-down in gun sales following a shooting attack San Bernardino, California. The hunting gun industry has been experiencing steep swings in sales amid uncertainty around gun law changes.     Cabela’s stock, which has fallen more than 20 percent since the beginning of the year, were down 2.4 percent at $50.80 in extended trade on Thursday. Columbus, Georgia-based Synovus Financial’s shares closed at $39.84 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the agreement.

269,COF,"Fed gives big U.S. banks a green light for buyback, dividend plans","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has approved plans from the 34 largest U.S. banks to use extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes beyond a cushion against possible catastrophe. On Wednesday, the Fed said all of the 34 banks had passed the second, tougher part of its annual stress test, showing that many of the biggest lenders have not only built up adequate capital levels but also improved their risk management procedures. One bank, Capital One Financial Corp, must resubmit its scheme by year-end, though the Fed is still allowing it to go forward with its capital plan in the meantime. Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who is acting as regulatory lead for the U.S. central bank, said the process “has motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels and most to substantially improve their capital planning processes.” The banks’ own plans on how they will use extra capital will not be known until they make their own announcements. The verdict marks a significant victory for the banking industry, which has worked for years to regain its stature following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The green light could also serve as a watershed moment for Wall Street, which is eager to get a lighter regulatory touch from policymakers in Washington. Capital One must resubmit plans because it did not appropriately account for risks in “one of its most material businesses,” the Fed said. The Fed did not specify which business. Capital One’s most significant business is credit card lending. It has also built up a presence in auto lending. Both areas have been flagged by bankers and analysts as showing signs of weakness. Capital One has until year-end to deliver an improved submission, but the Fed gave it permission to move forward with its plan until then. Capital One had already resubmitted a plan with a reduced capital request since the first set of stress-test results was released last week. American Express Co had also resubmitted a plan with reduced requests, improving its capital ratios, and the Fed did not require it to resubmit again. Other big banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co, Citigroup Inc , Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley also cleared the Fed’s bar.

272,COF,Fitch Affirms Capital One at 'A-/F2'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has today affirmed Capital One Financial's (COF) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (LT IDR) and Viability Rating (VR) at 'A-/a-'. The Outlook remains Stable. At the same time, Fitch affirmed COF's Short-Term IDR at 'F2'. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group, which includes BB&T; Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T; Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC). Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately, and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be published shortly. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT COF's rating reflects its strong banking franchise, its solid funding position and reasonable capital levels relative to its rating level. COF's ratings also reflect its efficient, scalable business model that has supported its earnings performance as credit quality reverts toward longer-term norms. Offsetting these rating strengths is COF's high proportion of consumer-related assets and more specifically its exposure to the near-and-subprime lending space. Fitch views this exposure as a rating constraint for COF and limits its upward rating potential over time. Today's affirmation is supported by good earnings performance and cost controls. COF has generally outperformed its peer group, largely driven by COF's comparatively higher net interest margin, given its proportionately larger mix of higher yielding credit card receivables and auto loans. Further supporting earnings performance is COF's strong efficiency ratio relative to peer banks. Going forward Fitch expects COF to continue to have a strong efficiency ratio given its significant investments in becoming digital in its operations and customer interfaces. Fitch continues to believe these investments have the potential to more meaningfully increase scale benefits for COF relative to peer institutions over time. Still, COF's earnings outperformance on a return on average assets (ROA) basis relative to peers has shrunk over recent periods primarily due to credit card asset quality deterioration. Consistent with industry trends, COF's level of credit card net charge-offs (NCOs) has increased over the last year. Much of the deterioration is related to COF's more recent origination vintages continuing to season within its domestic card book. Today's action reflects Fitch's expectation that credit deterioration within COF's consumer-focused portfolio will be manageable over the rating time horizon. NCOs within domestic credit cards increased to 5.1% through the first half of 2017 versus 4.1% in the first half of 2016. The company has indicated that the NCO rate within domestic cards would be around 5% for the full year 2017, pointing to moderating credit losses during the second half of the year. Monthly data disclosed by COF support its guidance as NCOs during July and August 2017 were both below 4.8%. Meanwhile, asset quality within COF's growing auto book remains solid. While NCOs have ticked up modestly, trends are consistent with the industry and in-line with Fitch's expectations. COFs auto loan portfolio has a higher proportion of loans to non-prime customers compared to auto portfolios of other peer institutions. As a result, Fitch believes COF's auto loan portfolio will exhibit higher delinquency trends and loss rates on a going forward relative to most other peer banks that have been more focused on originating only prime auto loans. Fitch generally expects the potential auto loan credit deterioration to be manageable through COF's quarterly earnings, but credit performance is expected to be slightly worse than its peers. This expectation is incorporated into today's rating affirmation and the Outlook Stable. Fitch views COF's capital ratios as supportive to its rating, particularly when taken in context of the company's ability to accrete capital via growth in retained earnings more quickly than some peers. However, Fitch continues to believe the strength of COF's capital position is partially offset by its higher concentration in consumer lending assets which carry higher loss ratios through credit cycles. COF's common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.6% on a standardized, fully phased-in basis, down 20bps on a year-over-year basis. Given the uptick in consumer-related credit costs, Fitch expects COF to keep CET1 levels at or above peer median levels over the rating time horizon. During 2Q17, the Fed released the results of its annual Comprehensive Capital Adequacy Review. COF received a conditional non-objection for qualitative reasons and will have to resubmit its capital plan by the end of the year. Today's affirmation reflects Fitch's expectation that COF will meet the requirements the Fed laid out and that COF will resubmit its capital plan within the required timeframe. While funding remains solid, Fitch believes COF's rating is constrained by its deposit profile over the long term. COF has grown its deposit base significantly coming out of the crisis and is much less dependent on wholesale funding relative to its past. However, the company is still heavily reliant on internet-based deposits relative to peers and has a loan-to-deposit ratio that hovers around 100%. These deposits have yet to go through a true rate tightening period. Although deposit betas have been relatively modest to date, Fitch expects additional rate hikes by the Fed to result in more significant increases in deposit rates for online banks, including COF. However, this should be at least partially offset by increasing asset yields. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES COF's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR for loss severity. COF's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times for loss severity and three times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (COBNA) and Capital One National Association (CONA) and Chevy Chase Bank, FSB are rated one notch higher than the bank's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY COF's VR is equalized with those of its operating companies and banks, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and default probabilities. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR COF has a Support Rating (SR) of '5' and Support Rating Floor (SRF) of 'NF'. In Fitch's view, the probability of support is unlikely. COF's IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDR VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch sees limited upside to COF's rating over the near-to-medium term given its exposure to the near-and-subprime consumer sector and its funding profile. Moreover, COF's limited revenue diversity relative to its peers is viewed as a rating constraint over time. In 2Q18, COF along with its peers will be required to disclose its full Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). Fitch expects most banks tied to the full LCR to operate with a ratio well-above the regulatory minimum of 100%. Given COF's deposit and funding profile, Fitch expects the company to manage its LCR ratio at-or-above peer median levels. Pressure could be placed on COF's ratings should it manage LCR consistently below the peer median. COF's ratings are also sensitive its asset quality metrics. To be clear, Fitch expects that there will be modest credit quality mean reversion over the rating time horizon. However if credit quality, particularly in the credit card and auto book (those asset classes that have grown notably over recent years), deteriorates faster than industry averages and is not manageable within the context of quarterly earnings COF's ratings or Outlook could be adversely impacted. Fitch would view well-below-median earnings performance due to elevated credit costs over the course of multiple quarters as a credit negative and a rating sensitivity. Finally, as noted above, Fitch expects COF to manage regulatory capital at or above peer median levels given its business model and loan mix. Although not expected, accelerated capital distributions or loan growth in excess of capital generation such that COF's CET1 ratio falls meaningfully below current levels would be viewed negatively and could result in negative rating action. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for COF and its operating companies' subordinated debt, trust preferred securities, and preferred stock are sensitive to any change to the VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to COF's long- and short-term IDR. HOLDING COMPANY Should COF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to meet near-term obligations, there is potential that Fitch could notch the holding company VR from the ratings of the operating companies. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since COF's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively, there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable future. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Capital One Financial Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Senior Shelf at 'A-' --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Preferred stock at 'BB'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'. Capital One Bank (USA), National Association --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Long-term deposits at 'A'; --Short-term deposit at 'F1'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'. Capital One National Association --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Long-term deposits at 'A'; --Short-term deposit at 'F1'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'. Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B --Long-term deposits at 'A'. Fitch has withdrawn the 'BBB+ 'subordinated debt rating of North Fork Bancorporation as the bonds have been repaid and entity is no longer issuing debt. Contact: Primary Analyst Bain K.

277,COF,"Capital One exits mortgage loans business, cuts 1,100 jobs","(Reuters) - Capital One Financial (COF.N) will stop issuing mortgage and home equity loans and cut some 1,100 jobs amid rising interest rates that have pushed away borrowers and slowed loan growth at many U.S. regional banks. The McLean, Virginia-based lender said on Wednesday it would continue to service its existing home loans portfolio, as it evaluates options for its home loans servicing business. “The challenging rate environment and marketplace ... do not allow us to be both competitive and profitable for the foreseeable future,” Sanjiv Yajnik, the president of financial services at Capital One, said in an internal memo on Tuesday. Several regional lenders in the U.S. have struggled to boost loan growth as interest rates come off historic lows and increase the cost of borrowing for consumers. The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates three times since the second quarter of 2016, with the latest hike coming this June. Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY.N), for instance, trimmed its 2017 expectations for total loans last month, after reporting a lower-than-expected profit for the third quarter. Capital One’s job cuts will affect about 950 employees in Texas, and 155 workers in Minnesota and New York. The company had about 50,400 employees at the end of September.

279,COF,UPDATE 2-U.S. Senate reaches deal to cut number of systemically important banks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators said on Monday they had reached a tentative deal to cut the number of banks labeled systemically risky, in a major step forward for efforts to roll back regulations enacted following the 2008 financial crisis. The bill would exempt banks with less than $250 billion in assets - including BB&T;, SunTrust Banks and American Express - from heightened regulatory scrutiny, in a move that could redraw the domestic U.S. banking landscape by reducing costs and unleashing a wave of mergers and acquisitions activity. The agreement also proposes exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the so-called Volcker Rule which bans banks from speculating in markets with their own capital - despised by lenders for its heavy compliance costs. Bankers, who have been lobbying hard for congressional regulatory relief under the business-friendly administration of Republican President Donald Trump, cheered the deal as a positive signal for the industry.  “While this legislation could go much further, ABA still views this bipartisan bill as an important first step in right-sizing the rules for America’s banks,” Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association said in a statement. The House of Representatives has already passed a broad rewrite of the Dodd-Frank law, but Senate agreement is necessary before the Republican-led Congress can approve easing rules for  banks.  Industry expectations on a final deal had been muted because Senate Republicans need eight Democrats to support their efforts in order to pass changes to the post-crisis rules. The Senate bill, which is more limited in scope than the House’s original proposal, has nine Democratic co-sponsors, meaning it is likely to pass into law.  Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo struck the deal with a group of moderate Democratic senators including Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp, Jon Tester and Mark Warner, who took over the discussions with Crapo after the committee’s ranking Democrat, Sherrod Brown, walked away from the talks last week. In a statement, Crapo said the proposal would “right-size” regulation for small banks, but it has been strongly opposed by consumer groups and some powerful Democrats who argue it will increase risks to the system, potentially hurting consumers. “I understand my colleagues’ interest in agreeing to this legislation, but disagree on the wisdom of rolling back so many of Dodd-Frank’s protections with almost no gains for working families,” Brown said in a statement.  The KBW Regional Banking Index of bank stocks turned positive around midday and was up about 1.4 percent after steadily climbing in afternoon trading. Central to the bipartisan discussions has been the asset threshold at which banks are deemed systemically important financial institutions or “SIFIs,” subjecting them to much stricter oversight including higher capital buffers. That threshold starts at $50 billion, but Monday’s bill would raise it to $250 billion, releasing more than a dozen banks from the stricter rules, according to an analysis by the government’s Office of Financial Research.  Banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would be exempt once the bill is enacted, while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion would be exempted 18 months later.  The bill would give the Federal Reserve discretion to release banks in the second bracket from the SIFI designation prior to the 18-month deadline if it sees fit, and to reinstate them as SIFIs afterward, subject to certain conditions still being drawn up.  Raising the threshold would not only reduce costs for many banks but allow those that have hovered beneath the $50 billion threshold to do deals and expand their balance sheets without fear of being caught by stricter oversight. Although the bill represented a win for many mid-sized lenders, the SIFI issue had become highly sensitive in the banking industry, according to lobbyists.  This is because banks that fall on the other side of the $250 billion threshold - including State Street Bank and Trust and Capital One Financial Corp - are likely to be put at a disadvantage as their close competitors enjoy a sudden drop in business costs.  Nichols said that the ABA would continue to lobby for lawmakers to do away with “arbitrary” asset thresholds altogether and to focus instead on banks’ activities when assessing if they should be designated as SIFIs.  The details of the bill will be drawn up in coming weeks, after which it will be subject to a vote by the committee and the Senate.

280,COF,Big U.S. banks in last-ditch push on regulatory relief bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street banks and big regional lenders are scrambling to secure changes to a U.S. Senate bill easing rules on smaller banks ahead of a key lawmaker meeting next week, several bank lobbyists told Reuters. The effort underscores how a year into the presidency of Republican Donald Trump, who pledged to slash financial red tape, the largest U.S. banks are still struggling to secure the regulatory relief they had hoped for. The bill offers little relief for many bigger lenders but lifts a significant burden for smaller banks and custodians. Large lenders are pushing for tweaks to help narrow that gap, multiple people with knowledge of their strategies said.    Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee this month reached a tentative deal that would more than halve the number of banks labeled systemically risky, freeing them from stricter oversight from the Federal Reserve. The bipartisan bill would mark the first major easing of financial regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 financial crisis.     But it has disappointed many of the largest U.S. banks, which under the bill are still big enough to be lumbered with the costly systemically risky label, and for which the bill currently offers few other compensations. That group includes JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM)N>, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), which are global banks, as well as U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), which are domestic.     Senate Republicans spent months winning support of at least eight Democrats needed to pass the bill, resulting in a compromise that raises the threshold at which lenders are deemed systemically risky to $250 billion from $50 billion.  That would put the so-called super-regional banks like U.S. Bancorp, Capital One and PNC, which are above the new threshold but not global, at a disadvantage to their smaller regional competitors freed from the extra regulatory burden.  “We are disappointed. We would rather see no bill than this bill,” said one super-regional bank lobbyist, adding that regardless his institution would not oppose the bill. “Plan B ... is to fix it on the margins.” Senators will formally discuss any potential changes to the bill next week. While there is little prospect of shifting the asset threshold, the super-regionals hope to win tweaks to other areas of the bill that would reduce the operational burden associated with some capital calculations and give the Federal Reserve more freedom when applying the systemically risky rules, three people with knowledge of the strategy said. The bill also makes life much easier for custody banks like BNY Mellon (BK.N) and State Street Corp (STT.N) by exempting the customer deposits they place with central banks from a stringent capital calculation requirement. The rest of the global U.S. banks are hoping to persuade lawmakers to put them on an equal footing with the custodians, three other people with knowledge of the discussions said.  Any of those changes will likely be a tough sell. Senator Mark Warner, one of bill’s Democratic co-sponsors, said the bill had struck a delicate balance between Democrat and Republican priorities. “Both sides are at their breaking point,” he said.  But lobbyists believe they will have another opportunity to push for changes when the Republican-dominated U.S. House of Representatives considers the Senate bill once it passes.  Some lobbyists believe they can garner enough support from House Republicans to have their changes incorporated into a final compromise package. Tom Quaadman, an executive vice president with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said it was “disappointing” Congress simply raised the threshold. But the business group broadly supports the bill as a step toward easing rules it says are suffocating small business lending. “We think that Congress in the end is going to have to do more to get to a solution,” Quaadman added.

281,COF,Capital One must face overdraft fee lawsuit: U.S. appeals court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday revived a proposed class-action lawsuit accusing Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) of imposing illegal overdraft fees on customers. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Capital One’s overdraft fee rules were ambiguous, and a lower court judge was wrong to dismiss a breach of contract claim. It also revived a claim under a New York state consumer protection law. Capital One, based in McLean, Virginia, had no immediate comment on the decision. “We’re pleased with the outcome,” said Matthew Wessler, a lawyer for the plaintiff Tawanna Roberts, a Capital One customer in the New York City borough of the Bronx. “Capital One illegally extracted overdraft fees for purchases that were made when consumers had enough funds in their accounts.” Banks impose overdraft fees, typically $35, when they pay merchants for purchases by customers who lack sufficient funds in their accounts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has said U.S. overdraft and bounced check fees totaled about $15 billion in 2016. Roberts accused Capital One of illegally imposing overdraft fees when it settled transactions, the time it paid merchants, instead of when it authorized transactions at the cash register. Transactions settle after merchants request payments, which is not always immediate and can take days. To illustrate, if a customer with $100 in her account made five $10 purchases and then made a $100 purchase, she would face only one overdraft fee if the transactions were settled in order, but five fees if the $100 purchase were settled first. Capital One told customers it had sole discretion to “elect to pay checks and other items drawn on your deposit account or to permit automatic bill payments and withdrawals against your account for an amount in excess of your available balance (an ‘Overdraft’).” The three-judge appeals court found it “equally reasonable” to understand the term “overdraft” as referring to Capital One’s decision to make a payment, at the time of authorization, or the payment itself, at the time of settlement. It returned the case to U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan for further proceedings. The appeals court upheld Schofield’s dismissal of three other claims. The case is Roberts v. Capital One NA, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-1762.

Capital One told customers it had sole discretion to “elect to pay checks and other items drawn on your deposit account or to permit automatic bill payments and withdrawals against your account for an amount in excess of your available balance (an ‘Overdraft’).” The three-judge appeals court found it “equally reasonable” to understand the term “overdraft” as referring to Capital One’s decision to make a payment, at the time of authorization, or the payment itself, at the time of settlement. It returned the case to U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan for further proceedings. The appeals court upheld Schofield’s dismissal of three other claims. The case is Roberts v. Capital One NA, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-1762.

The discount brokerage will pay $170 million for the brokerage accounts, which will add roughly $1.7 billion in cash and $115 million in margin loans to E*Trade’s balance sheet, executives said on a conference call with analysts.     “Opportunities like this, in which we can efficiently add a large number of customers to our highly scalable platform, do not come along often,” Karl Roessner, E*Trade’s chief executive, said on the call. Capital One declined to comment and referred questions to E*Trade.  Clients in these new accounts trade less frequently than E*Trade’s typical client base. However, the acquisition price, broken down by accounts, was lower than E*Trade’s usual client acquisition cost, Roessner said.  “The price was right, and we went after scale,” Roessner said. The deal is expected to close by the third quarter this year, subject to regulatory approvals, and will have a neutral impact on 2018 earnings, executives said. Funding will come from existing corporate cash.
