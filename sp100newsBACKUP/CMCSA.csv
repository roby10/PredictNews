1,CMCSA,Internet providers to act against online pirates,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Consumers who illegally download copyrighted films, music or television shows might see their Internet speed slowed or access restricted under an industry anti-piracy effort announced on Thursday.  U.S. Internet service providers, including Verizon Communications Inc, Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable Inc, Cablevision Systems Corp and AT&T Inc agreed to alert customers, up to six times, when it appears their account is used for illegal downloading. Warnings will come as e-mails or pop-up messages.  If suspected illegal activity persists, the provider might temporarily slow Internet speed or redirect the browser to a specific Web page until the customer contacts the company. The user can seek an independent review of whether they acted legally.  Internet access will not be terminated, according to a statement from the industry partners behind the effort. The coalition includes groups representing movie studios, independent film makers and record labels.  The group argues that content piracy costs the U.S. economy more than 373,000 jobs, $16 billion in lost earnings and $3 billion in tax revenue each year.  Industry officials said they thought most people would stop copyright violations once they were warned about illegal activity. The warnings also might alert parents unaware of their children’s activity.  “We are confident that, once informed that content theft is taking place on their accounts, the great majority of broadband subscribers will take steps to stop it,” James Assey, executive vice president of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, said in a statement.  Two consumer groups said the effort had the “potential to be an important educational vehicle” to help reduce online copyright infringement, but voiced concern about the sanctions.  “We are particularly disappointed that the agreement lists Internet account suspension among the possible remedies,” the Center for Democracy & Technology and Public Knowledge said in a statement.  The groups said it would be “wrong for any (Internet service provider) to cut off subscribers, even temporarily, based on allegations that have not been tested in court.”  The Obama administration welcomed the industry effort.  “We believe it will have a significant impact on reducing online piracy,” Victoria Espinel, the U.S. intellectual property enforcement coordinator, wrote on the White House blog.  The administration expects the organization that implements the program to consult with advocacy groups “to assure that its practices are fully consistent with the democratic values that have helped the Internet to flourish,” she added.

5,CMCSA,NBC deal secures IOC finances for decade: Carrion,"DURBAN, South Africa (Reuters) - NBC Universal’s $4.38 billion deal for the U.S. broadcast rights of the Olympics has secured the movement’s financial future for the rest of the decade, the International Olympic Committee’s Richard Carrion said on Friday.  NBC Universal, which is controlled by Comcast Corp and has broadcast every summer Olympics since 1988 and every winter edition since 2002, acquired the rights in June for four Games from 2014 to 2020 in the biggest single TV deal in the IOC’s history.  “The fact that we have this deal is very good,” IOC Executive Board member Carrion, the chief negotiator of the deal, told Reuters during an IOC meeting in Durban.  “It gives us a solid basis. From a financial perspective it assures financial security of the Olympic movement for the rest of the decade.”  The American network beat out rivals Fox and ESPN during a bidding process in Lausanne last month.  Carrion, a Puerto Rican who also heads the IOC’s Finance Commission, said NBC Universal had added a multi-million dollar incentive if the IOC opted for the unusually long four-Games bid instead of just a two-Games contract.  “It was clever of NBC to add a $100 million-plus incentive to move toward a four-Games deal,” Carrion said.  Apart from mobile phone, TV and internet rights, NBC also controls those for media that may be developed in the future.  “What has been the game-changer has been the ipad,” said Carrion.  “They may have sold less than 50 million worldwide but it gives you a flavor (of things to come). We are starting to get more and more of these devices out. Over the next three years it will become more ubiquitous.”  Carrion said broadcasters had also realized the internet and on-line forms of pitching the Games to consumers could be used to their advantage instead of being viewed as a possible liability.  “There was a fear from broadcasters that putting it (Games) on the internet would leak value. Clearly that is not.  “People using the internet are more intense viewers of the (Olympic) broadcast,” he said.  Carrion said what broadcasters now needed to do was to turn new media into sources of revenues, adding that Comcast was well-placed to manage this transition.  “How do you integrate broadcasts with other platforms and how do you monetize that?” he said.  “NBC are very happy with the result and Comcast understands distribution very well.”  Carrion, considered a likely contender for the IOC presidency when current chief Jacques Rogge steps down in 2013, declined to make his intentions known.  “I am flattered by this but now is not the time,” he said.  “After the London 2012 Games is the time to talk about this,” he said, leaving a door open for a possible bid for the top Olympic job.

7,CMCSA,"""Transformers"" global box office hits $645 million","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Big-budget action film “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” won the battle of the box office for the second-straight weekend, generating $140 million in global ticket sales and pushing its worldwide total since its debut to $645 million, studio estimates showed on Sunday.  The third installment of the popular “Transformers” films about shape-shifting aliens was the No. 1 film in the United States and Canada with $47 million in sales. It easily beat two new comedies, “Horrible Bosses” which took in $28 million, and family film “Zookeeper,” the weekend’s No. 3 movie with $21 million.  “Transformers” remained strong over the weekend internationally with $93 million in ticket sales from 59 markets, according to distributor Paramount Pictures.  Overall, the effects-filled Hollywood flick has now taken in $261 million in domestic theaters (the U.S. and Canada) to become the year’s highest-grossing movie, so far. And it has hauled in another $384 million overseas.  The success of the 3-D sci-fi flick also helped pull audiences into theaters for the new comedies, which generated decent sales amid low expectations during a summer weekend light on big new releases.  “‘Transformers 3’ is helping the overall marketplace by performing well,” said Paul Dergarabedian, box office analyst with Hollywood.com. The 52 percent drop in domestic ticket sales versus the film’s opening weekend last week was unusually low after a big opening, he said.  “Horrible Bosses,” which centers on three male friends who plot to kill their mean bosses, did better than expected as adult comedies like it and “Hangover 2” and “Bad Teacher” continued to appeal to fans this summer. “Bosses” stars Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis, along with Jennifer Aniston as one of the bosses.  “Zookeeper,” a family-oriented comedy starring Kevin James, also turned in a solid start domestically and good numbers overseas, distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment said. International sales hit $7.5 million, mostly from Germany and Mexico, on about 1,500 screens.  “Cars 2,” the sequel from Disney’s Pixar animation studio, claimed the No. 4 spot on domestic box office charts with $15 million, and the Cameron Diaz comedy “Bad Teacher” was fifth with $9 million.  “Transformers” was released by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom Inc., “Horrible Bosses” was distributed by Warner Bros., a division of Time Warner Inc., and “Zookeeper” and “Bad Teacher” were released by the studio division of Sony Pictures Entertainment, a unit of Sony Corp.

13,CMCSA,"Netflix price rise draws user ire, investor glee","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc’s hefty price increase provoked an unprecedented outpouring of outrage on the Internet, but Wall Street cautiously welcomed the move, sending its shares up nearly 3 percent on Wednesday.  Thousands of subscribers complained on Netflix’s official blog with many threatening to cancel subscriptions after the fast-growing video service raised prices by up to 60 percent for users of both its streaming and DVD-mail service.  Many said they would consider options such as Hulu, the Internet video service owned by Comcast Corp NBC Universal, News Corp, Walt Disney Co and Providence Equity Partners, or even Redbox, whose once booming kiosk-rental service had been eclipsed by online, instant Web offerings.  “Who’s genius idea is this crap?” said one comment on the Netflix blog, which promised to cancel service. “Your streaming selection sucks and the Red Box is looking better and better these days!”  The higher prices clearly stirred passions among the company’s subscribers, but Netflix brushed off the criticism as expected from a vocal minority.  “We knew there would be some people who would be upset,” company spokesman Steve Swasey said.  The increase amounts to $6 a month for one DVD at a time plus unlimited streaming.  “To most people, it’s a latte or two,” he added.  The company expects some cancellations, Swasey said, but he declined to say how many.  Some industry analysts argued the higher prices should make up for cancellations, in part by driving customers toward more profitable Netflix plans.  Subscribers who cancel are likely to be in lower-priced plans, with one DVD at a time, who turn in more DVDs, said Goldman Sachs analyst Ingrid Chung.  “Gross margins should benefit as we believe that the majority of lower-priced (subscribers) were less profitable for Netflix,” Chung said in a research note.  Lower-priced subscribers also might be drawn to the streaming service, “which has very incremental margin,” wrote Chung, who has a “buy” rating on Netflix shares.  The new prices take effect immediately for new subscribers and in September for current customers.  Netflix’s price rise comes as it finds itself writing increasingly large checks for the rights to the movies and TV shows its customers expect to find from its streaming service.  In one such deal, Netflix renewed on Wednesday a multi-year agreement with Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal, giving it rights to stream previous season hits such as “The Office” and Parenthood” from NBC and series, including “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” and “Psych”, from its cable networks. The financial details were not disclosed.  Netflix said on Tuesday it was raising by 60 percent the monthly price of a plan that lets subscribers watch unlimited movies and video online and get DVDs by mail.  The price for unlimited streaming plus rental of one DVD at a time will run about $16, up from about $10. Subscribing to just streaming, or just one DVD at a time, costs about $8.  One comment on the Netflix blog was more accepting.  “If you can improve your streaming selections it would be a benefit. I now pay the price of both anyway so I don’t see a downside for me,” wrote a person identified as “Scott.”  While customers vented on the Netflix blog and Facebook page, the company’s shares rose 2.6 percent to close at $298.73 on Nasdaq.

Lower-priced subscribers also might be drawn to the streaming service, “which has very incremental margin,” wrote Chung, who has a “buy” rating on Netflix shares.   The new prices take effect immediately for new subscribers and in September for current customers.   Netflix’s price rise comes as it finds itself writing increasingly large checks for the rights to the movies and TV shows its customers expect to find from its streaming service.   In one such deal, Netflix renewed on Wednesday a multi-year agreement with Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBC Universal, giving it rights to stream previous season hits such as “The Office” and Parenthood” from NBC and series, including “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” and “Psych”, from its cable networks. The financial details were not disclosed.   Netflix said on Tuesday it was raising by 60 percent the monthly price of a plan that lets subscribers watch unlimited movies and video online and get DVDs by mail.   The price for unlimited streaming plus rental of one DVD at a time will run about $16, up from about $10. Subscribing to just streaming, or just one DVD at a time, costs about $8.   One comment on the Netflix blog was more accepting.   “If you can improve your streaming selections it would be a benefit. I now pay the price of both anyway so I don’t see a downside for me,” wrote a person identified as “Scott.”   While customers vented on the Netflix blog and Facebook page, the company’s shares rose 2.6 percent to close at $298.73 on Nasdaq.

15,CMCSA,Lesser-known networks spark Emmy buzz in Hollywood,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - With 104 Emmy nominations on Thursday, cable TV’s HBO again dominated rival networks for the industry’s highest awards, but several nods from lesser-known networks truly had Hollywood talking.  ReelzChannel, whose focus is showing feature films and original programs about Hollywood movies, took on a big risk when it aired controversial TV miniseries “The Kennedys” back in April, but the move paid off in viewership and Emmy nods.  The network earned 10 of the highly coveted nominations, where before it hadn’t had any, including a nod for best miniseries or movie and one each for Greg Kinnear and Barry Pepper in the category of best actor.  After football drama “Friday Night Lights” was punted from the NBC network, satellite TV operator DirecTV put the show on its Audience Network for original programs. The satellite operator’s reward: four nods including for the top Emmy, best TV drama series, and one each for Kyle Chandler as best dramatic actor and Connie Britton, best dramatic actress.  The Starz network, too, brought in nine Emmy nods for its shows “Pillars of the Earth,” “Spartacus: Gods of the Arena” and “Camelot.”  The nods underscore a trend in TV that has seen dramas, which in recent years generally have appealed to more narrowly targeted audiences, being replaced on network TV by reality and competition programs that are aimed at broad viewership.  Operations like ReelzChannel or Audience Network with fewer viewers can take the top-quality dramas and use them to attract new audiences, which only enhances overall viewership.  “On cable, we are seeing a strong point of view which is extremely original. Cable TV has a very specific audience. It is a niche market for the most part,” said John Shaffner, chairman of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.  Stan E. Hubbard, chief executive of ReelzChannel made the decision to pick up “The Kennedys” when The History Channel pulled it from its lineup. The miniseries had drawn fire from some critics who claimed it painted an unflattering portrait of slain U.S. President John F. Kennedy and his family.  But with controversy comes publicity, and that often lures viewers who want to see what all the fuss is about.  “Our daily average ratings have doubled since we announced ‘The Kennedys’ was coming,” Hubbard said. The Emmy nod, he said, should only bring more attention to the channel, and he added that the nomination validated the production’s quality.  The Audience Network is somewhat different. Because the channel is owned by subscriber-based DirecTV, its aim is less about attracting new viewers and more about retaining current ones, said Patty Ishimoto, general manager of original entertainment at DirecTV.  Still, she said the move toward original programing and high-quality dramas — Audience Network recently picked up the Glenn Close show “Damages” — has been a success.  To be sure, the nods for ReelzChannel, Audience Network and Starz are small by comparison to the likes of mighty HBO with its flashy, expensive productions such as “Boardwalk Empire” and “Mildred Pierce” — Emmy’s most-nominated program.  CBS garnered 50 nominations to be the second most-nominated network. NBC had 46, Fox 42, and ABC 40.  But it was only a few years back that the same things were being said about cable network AMC, and now it is considered one of the key stops on TV remote controls for quality drama after multiple Emmy wins for “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad.”  ",7142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-emmys-networks/lesser-known-networks-spark-emmy-buzz-in-hollywood-idUSTRE76D72N20110714
16,CMCSA,Drew Peterson demands halt to TV movie on murder case,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Accused murderer Drew Peterson has demanded a halt to a planned TV movie about his case starring actor Rob Lowe, his lawyer said on Thursday.  “Ladykiller: The Drew Peterson Story,” which Hollywood industry websites said last month was being filmed for Lifetime television, is based on what Peterson’s attorney called an “extremely opinionated, blatantly biased, less than seriously researched and defamatory book.”  The movie could also bias potential jurors against Peterson, a former suburban Chicago police officer who is awaiting trial in the death of his third wife, attorney Walter Maksym said.  The “cease and desist” letter was addressed to Lowe, Lifetime Entertainment and its parent companies, A&E Television Networks, Disney/ABC Television Group, Hearst Corporation, and other entities.  Maksym said he sent the letter Wednesday evening and had not received any responses.  Peterson has pleaded not guilty to the 2004 killing of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, who was found dead in the couple’s bathtub in what was initially termed an accidental drowning but later ruled a homicide.  His fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, disappeared in 2007 in a case that is unsolved. “Big Bang Theory” actress Kaley Cuoco is expected to play Stacy Peterson in the movie.

ABC’s “Modern Family,” which took the top comedy prize last year, earned a total of 17 nominations, including mentions for stars Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara.  Other contenders in the best drama series race were HBO’s new prohibition era series “Boardwalk Empire” with a total of 18 nods, CBS legal program “The Good Wife,” freshman fantasy “Game of Thrones,” “Dexter” and “Friday Night Lights.”  Among comedy series, “Modern Family” will face off for best program against veteran “30 Rock,” first time nominee “Parks and Recreation,” “The Big Bang Theory” and “The Office.”  Fox’s quirky musical comedy “Glee”, which dominated last year’s Emmy nominations, got just 12 mentions this year, including best comedy and supporting acting nods for Chris Colfer and Jane Lynch. But it failed to grab any spots in the lead acting categories.  HBO’s miniseries “Mildred Pierce” had the largest number of nominations with a total of 21, including nods for its stars Kate Winslet and Evan Rachel Wood.  Five of the 12 nominated comedy and drama series are first time nominees. The acting categories featured a slew of Emmy rookies including Melissa McCarthy in freshman comedy “Mike & Molly,” Martha Plimpton for “Raising Hope,” Mireille Enos in the AMC crime drama “The Killing” and Timothy Olyphant in the modern Western drama “Justified” on FX.  “It is great that we are recognizing the spectrum of television. We are here to celebrate television and let our audience around the world know how great TV is,” said John Shaffner, chairman of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.  The Emmys will be handed out at a ceremony in Los Angeles on September 18, hosted by “Glee” star Jane Lynch.  HBO was again the most nominated network, despite a controversial decision this year to merge the miniseries and TV movie categories, which the cable channel has traditionally dominated.  HBO garnered 104 nominations overall, followed by CBS with 50, NBC with 46, Fox 42, and ABC with 40.  Some of TV’s favorite stars were recognized on Thursday in new roles. They included former “Friends” actor Matt LeBlanc, who plays a version of himself in the Showtime satire “Episodes,” and Betty White, age 89, who earned her 17th Emmy nomination for a supporting role in comedy “Hot in Cleveland.”  Cloris Leachman, age 85, notched her 22nd nod for a supporting role as the ditzy grandmother in Fox show “Raising Hope,” while veteran Kathy Bates scored a lead actress nomination for playing a cranky lawyer in the new NBC drama “Harry’s Law.”  ",7142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-emmys/mad-men-modern-family-to-defend-emmy-wins-idUSTRE76D2O820110714

Warner Bros., the film studio behind the new “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,” on Thursday said the movie’s debut in 26 countries one day earlier was 87 percent higher than its predecessor film, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1” and 49 percent above 2009’s “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.”  Of the total international box office, about 65 percent was coming from 3D screens, which should help support the market for 3D movies which has seen some weakness this year.

27,CMCSA,"""Mad Men,"" ""Modern Family"" to defend Emmy wins","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Stylish 1960s advertising drama “Mad Men” and mockumentary comedy “Modern Family” will vie again for the top prizes at the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards in a field packed with newcomers and veteran actors in new roles.  “Mad Men,” the three-time Emmy winner for best dramatic show, scored 19 nominations on Thursday for TV’s highest honors, including best drama series and acting nods for its stars Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss.  ABC’s “Modern Family,” which took the top comedy prize last year, earned a total of 17 nominations, including mentions for stars Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara.  Other contenders in the best drama series race were HBO’s new prohibition era series “Boardwalk Empire” with a total of 18 nods, CBS legal program “The Good Wife,” freshman fantasy “Game of Thrones,” “Dexter” and “Friday Night Lights.”  Among comedy series, “Modern Family” will face off for best program against veteran “30 Rock,” first time nominee “Parks and Recreation,” “The Big Bang Theory” and “The Office.”  Fox’s quirky musical comedy “Glee”, which dominated last year’s Emmy nominations, got just 12 mentions this year, including best comedy and supporting acting nods for Chris Colfer and Jane Lynch. But it failed to grab any spots in the lead acting categories.  HBO’s miniseries “Mildred Pierce” had the largest number of nominations with a total of 21, including nods for its stars Kate Winslet and Evan Rachel Wood.  Five of the 12 nominated comedy and drama series are first time nominees. The acting categories featured a slew of Emmy rookies including Melissa McCarthy in freshman comedy “Mike & Molly,” Martha Plimpton for “Raising Hope,” Mireille Enos in the AMC crime drama “The Killing” and Timothy Olyphant in the modern Western drama “Justified” on FX.  “It is great that we are recognizing the spectrum of television. We are here to celebrate television and let our audience around the world know how great TV is,” said John Shaffner, chairman of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.  The Emmys will be handed out at a ceremony in Los Angeles on September 18, hosted by “Glee” star Jane Lynch.  HBO was again the most nominated network, despite a controversial decision this year to merge the miniseries and TV movie categories, which the cable channel has traditionally dominated.  HBO garnered 104 nominations overall, followed by CBS with 50, NBC with 46, Fox 42, and ABC with 40.  Some of TV’s favorite stars were recognized on Thursday in new roles. They included former “Friends” actor Matt LeBlanc, who plays a version of himself in the Showtime satire “Episodes,” and Betty White, age 89, who earned her 17th Emmy nomination for a supporting role in comedy “Hot in Cleveland.”  Cloris Leachman, age 85, notched her 22nd nod for a supporting role as the ditzy grandmother in Fox show “Raising Hope,” while veteran Kathy Bates scored a lead actress nomination for playing a cranky lawyer in the new NBC drama “Harry’s Law.”  ",7152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-emmys/mad-men-modern-family-to-defend-emmy-wins-idUSTRE76D2O820110715
28,CMCSA,Hollywood turns on the starpower for Comic-Con,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Heading into this year’s giant Comic-Con International pop culture convention in San Diego, media watchers believed Hollywood might play a smaller role because some heavily promoted movies there in 2010 fizzled at box offices.  But as Thursday’s opening day nears, the 2011 gathering of comic book readers, sci-fi lovers, fanboys, fangirls and pop culture watchers — many costumed as space aliens or invaders — appears bigger, glitzier and more crowded than ever.  Forecasters predict anywhere from 130,000 to as many as 200,000 people will invade San Diego over the four-day convention, although numbers are difficult to track given the volume of people who come just to be part of the scene.  Perhaps the most accurate indicator of the show’s growing popularity in recent years is that while it took six months for four-day event passes to sell out in 2009, and two months in 2010, this year those passes were gone in a mere seven hours.  And rabid fans likely won’t be disappointed with the number of events and starpower at the show nicknamed, “The Con”.  There are numerous panels for directors and stars to talk up films such as “Twilight: Breaking Dawn” and “The Amazing Spider-Man,” as well as several science-fiction TV shows. Even the cast of hit musical “Glee” will be on hand.  Although, similar promotional events in 2010 failed to have a big impact on the commercial prospects of some films and TV shows hyped here, such as “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” Hollywood’s studios and networks are back in force.  “I don’t think there is a direct relation between box office and what you do at Comic-Con,” Marc Weinstock, president of worldwide marketing for Sony Pictures, told Reuters.  “For ‘Total Recall,’ ‘Ghost Rider,’ and ‘The Amazing Spider-Man’ we’ll be showing footage no one has ever seen. People are going to be very, very excited,” Weinstock said.  But there is a difference this year, which boils down to timing. Generally speaking, Hollywood has used past Comic-Cons to build early buzz for movies and TV shows opening months away, but this year the big promotional bucks are being spent on films opening around the same time as the convention.  For instance, Marvel Studios is teaming Chris Evans, star “Captain America: The First Avenger,” with U.S. troops in a made-for-media event to coincide with Friday’s release of the movie. Universal Pictures’ “Cowboys & Aliens,” which opens July 29, is holding its world premiere on Saturday in San Diego.  Comic-Con stargazers will hardly be disappointed. Besides Steven Spielberg — at the show for the first time to both promote his new film “The Adventures of Tin Tin” and collect an award — others attending include Taylor Lautner, Jeff Bridges, Francis Ford Coppola, Justin Timberlake and Charlize Theron.  “I don’t know what to expect this year, but one thing I can expect is that it’s going to bigger than it’s ever been,” said Brannon Braga who, after first attending as a fan in the 1980’s, this year is presenting the first hour of the $16 million two-hour season premiere of sci-fi adventure TV show “Terra Nova,” which he co-produced with Spielberg.  Some of the other, more talked-about new TV shows anxious to woo crowds at The Con include fantasy-themed “Grimm” and “Once Upon a Time,” along with “Person of Interest” and “Alcatraz,” both produced by “Lost” creator J.J. Abrams.  The casts and creators from “Dexter,” “Supernatural,” “True Blood,” and “The Big Bang Theory” also will appear, buttressing their already loyal fan bases from past trips to Comic-Con.  “Breaking through the clutter becomes harder every year,” said Syfy Channel marketing vice-president Dana Ortiz, who will be making her 11th trip to Comic Con this year.  For cable TV channels like SyFy, Comic-Con is the perfect opportunity to market to, and get feedback from, a highly-targeted group of viewers. In fact, the team at SyFy begins planning for Comic-Con just after Christmas.  And for fans who can’t get to San Diego, Syfy has a solution. It has partnered with the E! Network to provide red carpet coverage of its annual party via online streaming. So, this year fans stuck at home will have the chance to see for themselves what the pop culture fuss is all about.

30,CMCSA,"""Harry Potter"" rings up record $476 million globally","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The final “Harry Potter” film shattered box office records worldwide with a whopping $168.6 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales over the opening weekend and nearly $476 million globally.  The staggering domestic total for “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2” is the best three-day opening for a film ever, distributor Warner Bros said on Sunday. It beat the previous record of $158.4 million over the initial three days for the 2008 Batman movie, “The Dark Knight.”  Internationally, the finale for “Harry Potter” captured $307 million in 59 countries since it opened last week, another record. That includes weekend sales plus Wednesday and Thursday for some markets.  The prior record for an overseas opening belonged to “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,” the fourth installment of the series released in May, which took in about $260 million outside North America in its debut.  The eighth film in the “Harry Potter” series about a teenage wizard and his friends battling against evil also set records for the largest opening-day domestic sales total, largest midnight screenings and largest opening on giant IMAX screens.  The movie took in an average $38,526 on more than 4,300 screens, according to Warner Bros, a unit of Time Warner Inc. It was the first “Potter” film also released in 3D.  “Harry Potter,” already the highest-grossing film franchise ever with over $6.4 billion in global ticket sales, is based on the novels of British author J.K. Rowling.  The massive numbers for “Deathly Hallows — Part 2” showed the story still enchants audiences a decade after Harry’s first film adventure was released.  “It’s become a cultural event,” said Dan Fellman, head of domestic distribution for Warner Bros. Young fans stuck with the series as they grew up and the audience expanded over the years, Fellman said, adding that final global ticket receipts could “easily” reach the rare $1 billion mark.  The “Harry Potter” magic dwarfed other films over the weekend, but there were a couple of notable events.  Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris” reached a milestone by hitting $41.8 million in domestic sales since its release, making it the highest-grossing film in North America from director Allen, according to distributor Sony Pictures Classics.  “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” took the No. 2 spot on U.S. and Canadian box office charts with an estimated $21.3 million over three days, distributor Paramount Pictures said. The film ranks as the year’s first film to top $300 million in domestic sales with $302.8 million total.  Rounding out the weekend’s top five domestic films were “Horrible Bosses” with $17.6 million, “Zookeeper” with $12.3 million and “Cars 2” with $8.3 million. Disney’s new “Winnie the Pooh” movie finished sixth with $8 million.  “Deathly Hallows — Part 2” and “Horrible Bosses” were released by Warner Bros. Pictures, a unit of Time Warner Inc. “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” was distributed by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom Inc.  “Zookeeper” and “Midnight in Paris” were released by various units of Sony Corp. “Cars 2” and “Winnie the Pooh” were distributed by Disney’s Pixar animation unit, a division of Walt Disney Co.

34,CMCSA,"Stan Lee reveals details of new comic ""Seekers""","SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Comic book legend Stan Lee on Friday revealed details of his new web-based, digital series “The Seekers,” saying it is set in modern times on an Earth in danger of imminent destruction.  Describing his upcoming new venture with MTV as “a real epic story”, Lee told Reuters that “Seekers” will have multiple characters and he hopes it will move from the Internet to TV, movies and videogames.  “It’s a real epic story,” said Lee, ahead of a detailed presentation of the new comic book series on Saturday at Comic-Con International.  “One of the blurbs I wrote for it says, ‘We present these incidents that you’re about to witness as a work of fiction in order to avoid worldwide apprehension and panic.’ It has to do really with the state of the Earth and all the population on it,” he added.  “The Seekers” will launch in early 2012 as a free digital comic series on the MTV Geek website and is expected to eventually become a print comic. Lee, 88, has big plans for what will be his first foray into digital comics.  “Television, movies, video games, you name it, it will be there,” said Lee, who helped create Marvel Comics superheroes “Spider-Man”, “Thor” and “Iron Man”.  Lee said he has written a six-page treatment for “The Seekers”. Thousands of years ago an alien race sent “seekers” to every planet in the universe with sentient life. When a race advances enough to a point that it might be a threat to other sentient life across the galaxy, these seekers have the ability to set off a doomsday device that will destroy the planet.  “Our whole planet is in danger,” said Lee. “It has to do with man’s inhumanity to man.”  Three of the main characters will be;  — The Gatherer, a seeker sent to Earth, who has recently awakened due to the nuclear and biological threats humans now harness.  — Arthur Nordan, a renowned radiologist who recently watched his colleagues killed by the Gatherer on an expedition.  — Jennifer Hart, a World News Network correspondent trying to get an interview with Nordan. The duo end up discovering the Seekers and the imminent threat posed by the Gatherer.  Lee said there would be many more players in the stories. “It’s a multi-character series, which introduces new characters while keeping the old ones in virtually every episode.”  What separates this comic from anything Lee has done before is that he’s giving an aspiring artist and comic book writer the chance to become a central part of the development of “The Seekers”.  Beginning in early August, MTV Geek will host a contest allowing anyone to send in their own interpretation of “The Seekers”. Artists will submit five pieces of art, while writers will turn in a 10-page script based on Lee’s treatment.  Lee and his team will pick 20 entries and the online community will vote for the top five submissions. Lee will announce the winners at New York Comic-Con in October and work directly with the artist and writer to create the comic.  “This contest is a big one and it’s important because we’re excited to give undiscovered talent a chance to shine,” he said.  “The comic book industry is expanding with digital comics and motion comics and video games. I think the opportunities are there for new talent, and this project is one way for people to get a job in the industry.”  “The Seekers” will join other digital comics that will run on MTV Geek, including Teen Wolf, Divination, The Gloom, Hats, Agent Mom, Me2, Punks, Hell Town, Beowulf Jones, and 1,000.  Tom Akel, executive editor of MTV Geek, said the website has attracted over 800,000 unique visitors since its mid-October launch last year. He expects the partnership with Lee to attract an even larger crowd.

36,CMCSA,GE tops Wall Street estimates on overseas demand,"BOSTON (Reuters) - General Electric Co notched a better-than-expected 21.6 percent rise in earnings, helped by strong demand for jet engines as well as equipment used in oil and natural gas production.  The largest U.S. conglomerate said on Friday its second-quarter results were helped by a rebound in sales of railroad locomotives, which offset weakening demand for wind turbines. With overall orders up 24 percent, pushing the company’s backlog to $189 billion, Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said he was confident about the rest of the year.  “We are optimistic about our growth prospects in the second half and beyond,” Immelt said.  The company’s industrial revenues outside the United States were up 23 percent in the quarter, outperforming the overall company, which recorded a 7 percent rise in sales from continuing operations.  Investors said the results showed the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company’s focus on emerging markets was paying off.  “GE’s strategy of growth in developing nations and energy and infrastructure and healthcare and technology is serving it well,” said Perry Adams, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Huntington Private Financial Group, in Traverse City, Michigan, which holds GE shares.  The rise in orders is a key sign that GE will be able to continue its pace of growth, said Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co.  “That’s the path back to the future,” he said.  GE shares were down 5 cents at $19.11 on Friday morning, a day when fellow blue-chip industrial Caterpillar Inc missed profit forecasts, sending its shares sharply lower and weighing on the broader stock market.  Over the past year, GE shares have risen 26 percent, ahead of the 23 percent rise in the Dow Jones industrial average.  The world’s largest maker of jet engines and electric turbines said second-quarter profit attributable to common shareholders rose to $3.69 billion, or 35 cents per share, from $3.03 billion, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.  Factoring out one-time items, profit was 34 cents per share. On that basis, analysts had expected 32 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue fell 3.5 percent to $35.63 billion, reflecting the sale of a majority stake in GE’s NBC Universal business to Comcast Corp. Analysts had expected $34.7 billion.  Profit fell 19 percent at GE’s energy unit, which incurred large costs to integrate the $11 billion wave of takeovers it made between September and March. Profit margins on renewable energy equipment deteriorated. Demand was split, with sales of equipment used in oil and natural gas production up 39 percent, and electricity-producing gear up just 1 percent.  “If oil keeps going up and if Congress and the president do something more on renewables, which they keep talking about but haven’t done, then margins have a long way to expand,” said Jack De Gan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. “They’re doing well to keep margins in those businesses as good as they are.”  ",7222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge/ge-tops-wall-street-estimates-on-overseas-demand-idUSTRE76K7FO20110722

The strong opening for “Captain America” topped expectations in its battle against the hugely successful “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,” which saw its massive opening-weekend audience from last week shrink by 72 percent.   The final installment in the popular “Potter” series took in $48.1 million over its second weekend in domestic (U.S. and Canadian) theaters, plus $121.3 million internationally, distributor Warner Bros. said on Sunday.   Romantic comedy “Friends with Benefits” starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, took the No. 3 spot over three days with $18.5 million domestically, a solid start for a film that cost about $34 million to produce, according to Sony Pictures studio.   “Captain America” drew a 64 percent male audience to the film set in the 1940s, about a scrawny, bullied orphan transformed into a muscular superhero thanks to a serum developed by the government. He is the latest Marvel comic book character to hit the big screen before the superheroes join forces in next year’s film “The Avengers.”   The success against the “Harry Potter” finale “was well beyond what anybody was expecting,” said Don Harris, executive vice president of distribution for Paramount Pictures, which released “Captain America.” The film drew positive reviews and “had a retro look to it” that appealed to moviegoers even after a summer filled with superhero flicks, he said.   For the eighth and final “Harry Potter” movie in the series about a British boy wizard battling against evil, sales dropped sharply, as expected, after avid fans had rushed to see the movie when it debuted. The film broke records around the world including best opening weekend ever in the domestic and international markets.   The film’s total ticket sales now stand at $274.2 million in domestic theaters and $560.4 million internationally, for a combined total of $834.6 million.   Other top films for the weekend were big-budget Hollywood film “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” at No. 4 with $12 million, and adult-oriented comedy “Horrible Bosses” at No. 5 with $11.7 million.   “Captain America” and “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” were released by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom Inc VIAb.N. Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), distributed “Deathly Hallows - Part 2” and “Horrible Bosses.” “Friends with Benefits” is from Screen Gems, a unit of Sony Corp (6758.T).

40,CMCSA,Reid's debt plan could speed wireless auctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Efforts to give U.S. regulators the authority to auction off some television airwaves for mobile broadband use are getting a boost in a debt ceiling plan proposed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  The auctions have the potential to raise $15 billion in revenue, according to Reid’s plan, with some of the proceeds going to broadcasters as compensation.  The Federal Communications Commission has been pushing for the authority to hold such auctions as a part of its broader National Broadband Plan. The FCC wants to repurpose 120 megahertz of spectrum currently used by TV broadcasters to free up more airwaves for rapidly growing wireless services.  The final shape of a plan to cut government spending in an effort to gain Republican support for raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion borrowing limit is very uncertain.  Lawmakers are still far apart over competing plans in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to raise the debt ceiling before August 2, when the U.S. Treasury says the government will start to run out of money to pay its bills.  The debt package proposed by House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, does not include spectrum auctions, multiple industry sources said.  But the inclusion by Reid, a Democrat, of the auction revenues could speed a spectrum reshuffle if it were to become part of the final plan.  Some 25 million Americans already watch video on smartphones and tablet computers like Apple Inc’s iPad, putting 120 times more demand on spectrum than older mobile phones.  “This deficit-reducing proposal reflects insight from members of the FCC, leading economists and wireless technology experts, all of whom have cautioned a spectrum crunch is looming,” said Jonathan Spalter, chairman of Mobile Future, a coalition whose membership includes technology and communications companies.  But broadcasters have expressed concerns over the unintended consequences repurposing their spectrum could have on their TV signals and the 46 million viewers that still rely on over-the-air TV.  Broadcasters worry that the FCC’s plan would affect not only those who voluntarily part with their spectrum, but the entire industry. The FCC would “repack,” or move TV stations, to make large swaths of spectrum considered more suited for mobile broadband use available.  A study released by the National Association of Broadcasters on Monday found that 40 percent of U.S. full power local television stations could have to vacate their current TV channel assignment.  “NAB is deeply concerned about provisions currently in Senate Majority Leader Reid’s legislation that would threaten the future of a great American institution — free and local television. We will work with him as the process moves forward in hopes that our issues can be addressed,” said Dennis Wharton, NAB’s executive vice president of communications.

42,CMCSA,Analysis: Pricing hit unlikely to deter Netflix growth,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc’s star darkened briefly this week after a rare stumble on pricing incensed investors and triggered an unusually dim growth projection.  But longer-term, Wall Street remains enamored of a company expected to ride an expansion beyond U.S. shores and a bigger streaming push that will cushion rising content-acquisition costs.  The company surprised investors by projecting a pause in its normally explosive subscriber growth, sending its shares plummeting as much as 10 percent on Tuesday.  Yet many industry experts and analysts accepted Chief Executive Reed Hastings’ view that the slowdown is a mere hiccup before user-growth returns to year-over-year increases.  “There is certainly plenty of room in the market for them to grow,” Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg said.  The new prices “still represent a good value for consumers,” who are increasingly turning a wide array of Internet-connected devices to watch television and movies, he said.  Still, a few analysts, including Wedbush’s Michael Pachter and Morgan Stanley’s Scott Devitt, sounded a note of caution on Tuesday, echoing concerns Netflix had come too far too fast.  Netflix shares were trading nearly 800 percent above levels in early 2009 and the stock has drawn heavy short interest. Reuters Starmine data ranks the stock higher than 86 percent of the stock in its group in how vulnerable it is to a short squeeze.  Devitt expects Netflix shares to “exhibit weakness” relative to its peer group over the next three months.”  “Confusion around the impact to the long-term subscriber growth trajectory in the U.S. market will linger on investor minds,” Devitt said in a research note, reiterating an “equal-weight” rating on Netflix shares.  Wedbush’s Pachter, who has rated Netflix “underperform” for more than a year, thought the company overestimated the number of people who would trade up to costlier plans, which separate costs for DVDs-by-mail and streaming plans. Subscribing to both services will cost more.  Pachter’s current 12-month price target is $110, up from his previous $100 target, but far below current levels.  Apart from the price increase, some say the company — despite touting an international expansion just getting in gear and more revenue for streaming offerings — will find content increasingly costly as it shores up its library to compete with the likes of Amazon Prime, Hulu and even Wal-Mart’s Vudu.  “Their biggest challenge is their content costs are escalating dramatically,” Pachter said.  Netflix said on Monday it would essentially end the third quarter with the same number, or slightly more, subscribers it had at the end of the second quarter. The company expected cancellations following a vocal backlash over a price increase as high as $6 a month for some customers.  Some analysts see room for its shares to rise further.  Even Barclays analyst Anthony DiClemente, who lowered his Netflix price target to $285 from $315 on Tuesday, kept an “overweight” rating and urged investors to “take advantage of any weakness.”  Netflix “continues to execute very well,” he said, adding he was optimistic about plans to expand to Latin America later this year and another market early next year.  The company that started sending DVDs by mail in red envelopes has quickly built a streaming service offering movies and television shows. It has grown to 25.6 million subscribers, more than Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable company.  Cancellations from the higher prices “will be more than offset” in the fourth quarter by a gain in average revenue per user, Credit Suisse analyst John Blackledge said in a research note. He raised his price target to $310 from $280.  “We view weakness on the results as a buying opportunity,” he said.  CEO Hastings said the fourth quarter would show a return to year-over-year growth of new subscribers. The higher pricing will help the company secure more streaming offerings to attract new customers.  “Fewer people are canceling than we expected. Our deals are coming together,” Hastings said in an interview.  Netflix shares fell 5.2 percent on Tuesday to close at $266.91 on Nasdaq.

43,CMCSA,Comcast bows live ads with on-demand on NBC Universal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cable company Comcast Corp is teaming up with its NBC Universal unit to help programmers dynamically place commercials around on-demand TV shows in a bid to drive new advertising revenue.  Until now, cable companies have manually inserted advertising into on-demand programing, where it remains as long as the TV show is available to subscribers. This has meant the ads could soon be out of date.  Using new technology from Comcast and partner Black Arrow, the ads can now easily be changed at any time. The new system is being tried out with TV shows from NBCU’s networks including Bravo, USA Network and Oxygen Media.  “On-demand is a huge platform and it’s going to grow significantly along with on-demand advertising,” said Marcien Jenckes, Comcast senior vice president of video services. He said Comcast has more than 350 million on-demand video streams.  Other cable operators are expected to soon be able to deliver a similar service to advertisers in partnership with Canoe Ventures — the cable industry-owned advertising company.  Philadelphia-based Comcast took control of NBC Universal in January.  Wall Street analysts had been critical of the $30 billion deal, saying there are few major synergies between Comcast’s cable distribution business and NBC Universal’s array of programing, movies and theme parks.  “We’ve not been huge believers in the synergies between Comcast and NBC but they seem to have found some nominal savings so far,” said Thomas Eagan analyst at Collins Stewart.

In letters to NBC’s local TV stations, the 1.3 million member Parents Television Council said the drama “glorifies and glamorizes this insidious industry” and that pornography destroys families and exploits women.  “The Playboy Club”, which is due to debut on September 19 in the 10pm timeslot, is set in the early 1960s and centers around the lives of Playboy Bunnies and customers of the original Playboy Club in Chicago.  It is described by NBC as a “provocative new drama about a time and place that challenged the social mores, where a visionary entrepreneur created an empire and an icon changed American culture.”  The network’s Utah affiliate has already announced it will not broadcast the drama.  The Parents Television Council (PTC), which campaigns against sex and violence on U.S. television, also asked NBC and its affiliates to refrain from airing promotions for the new shows on family friendly shows like “America’s Got Talent.”  NBC executives were not immediately available to comment on the PTC campaign.

49,CMCSA,Amazon unveils latest video streaming deal,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com unveiled its latest video streaming deal on Thursday as the world’s largest Internet retailer adds more digital content ahead of the expected launch of a new tablet computer later this year.  Amazon said it agreed to license roughly 1,000 Universal Pictures movies from NBCUniversal, which is 51 percent owned by Comcast and 49 percent owned by General Electric.  The films, which include “Elizabeth”, “Being John Malkovich” and “Billy Elliott” will be available to Amazon Prime members, who get free shipping and video streaming for a $79 annual membership, the company added.  Last week, Amazon signed a similar deal with CBS Corp that cost more than $100 million, according to Barclays Capital analyst Anthony DiClemente. That deal added about 2,000 videos to Amazon’s Prime streaming offering, bringing it to more than 8,000 movies and TV shows.  The NBC agreement will lift the total to more than 9,000 this summer, Amazon said on Thursday.  The deals increase competition among Amazon and video-streaming leader Netflix, as well as Apple and Hulu.  Netflix shares were down $1.81, or about .62 percent, to $267.78 in morning trading, while Amazon stock edged up 0.7 percent to $223.94. Apple shares were up slightly at $394.72.  Amazon is a leader in digital books through its Kindle e-reader and online bookstore. But the company is branching out into more digital content, including apps and games, as well as video.  The company is expected to launch a tablet computer later this year, giving it another platform from which to sell a wider range of digital content.  Netflix, the top movie rental service with 23 million subscribers, offers more than 20,000 titles through its streaming service. The company could have more than 30 million subscribers by the end of 2011, according to Barclays Capital analysts.  Amazon ended the second quarter with 144 million active users. Prime members account for less than 10 percent of active users, according to Barclays Capital estimates from earlier this year.

The films, which include “Elizabeth”, “Being John Malkovich” and “Billy Elliott” will be available to Amazon Prime members, who get free shipping and video streaming for a $79 annual membership, the company added.   Last week, Amazon signed a similar deal with CBS Corp (CBS.N) that cost more than $100 million, according to Barclays Capital analyst Anthony DiClemente. That deal added about 2,000 videos to Amazon’s Prime streaming offering, bringing it to more than 8,000 movies and TV shows.   The NBC agreement will lift the total to more than 9,000 this summer, Amazon said on Thursday.   The deals increase competition among Amazon and video-streaming leader Netflix (NFLX.O), as well as Apple (AAPL.O) and Hulu.   Netflix shares were down $1.81, or about .62 percent, to $267.78 in morning trading, while Amazon stock edged up 0.7 percent to $223.94. Apple shares were up slightly at $394.72.   Amazon is a leader in digital books through its Kindle e-reader and online bookstore. But the company is branching out into more digital content, including apps and games, as well as video.   The company is expected to launch a tablet computer later this year, giving it another platform from which to sell a wider range of digital content.   Netflix, the top movie rental service with 23 million subscribers, offers more than 20,000 titles through its streaming service. The company could have more than 30 million subscribers by the end of 2011, according to Barclays Capital analysts.   Amazon ended the second quarter with 144 million active users. Prime members account for less than 10 percent of active users, according to Barclays Capital estimates from earlier this year.

51,CMCSA,Time Warner Cable hurt by rivals for video subs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc’s TWC.N quarterly profit topped analysts’ forecasts, but its shares fell as it lost more video customers than expected due to increasing competition and the impact of the weak economy.  The U.S. No. 2 cable company lost 128,000 TV subscribers during the quarter as competition from satellite and phone companies increased.  Analysts at Collins Stewart had forecast video losses of around 115,000. Executives said they were also hurt by the ongoing weak economy, which has meant fewer new home moves.  The video losses were offset by the addition of 67,000 Internet customers and 45,000 voice customers.  Chief Executive Glenn Britt said the company views Internet services as a very important part of its future.  “As broadband becomes increasingly important to our customers, we think we can create additional value by making it available to them everywhere,” Britt said.  For the second quarter, net income rose to $420 million, or $1.24 per share, compared with $342 million, or 95 cents a share a year ago.  Revenue rose 4.4 percent to $4.94 billion.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.16 a share, excluding items, on revenue of $4.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  “The market may be over-reacting to the greater-than-expected video losses but also to the fact that they had been hoping for a share buy back announcement this quarter,” said Collins Steart analyst Thomas Eagan. “We think it may come in the third quarter.”  President Rob Marcus said the company was on course to meet its previously stated full-year earnings forecast of $4.25 to $4.50 per share.

55,CMCSA,"Surprise box office tie for ""Cowboys"", ""Smurfs""","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The tiny blue “Smurfs” battled big-name, big-budget “Cowboys & Aliens” to a surprising tie at the domestic weekend box office with each film ringing up an estimated $36.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates on Sunday.  “The Smurfs” live-action and animated 3D film drew families to the latest adventure of the classic Belgian cartoon characters and grossed higher-than-expected sales. “Cowboys & Aliens” fell short of pre-release estimates from box-office watchers.  The totals are estimates of ticket sales from United States and Canadian theaters for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The leader will not be known until actual sales are tallied on Monday.  Going into the weekend, “Cowboys & Aliens” was seen easily topping box-office charts with starpower from James Bond actor Daniel Craig and “Indiana Jones” star Harrison Ford, plus director Jon Favreau from the hit “Iron Man” series and Steven Spielberg among the producers. The film is set in the Wild West in 1873, when a spaceship arrives in Arizona and runs into a posse of cowboys.  The movie offered “a fresh and unique concept,” said Nikki Rocco, president of distribution for Universal Pictures, a division of Comcast Corp that released the film. “It was a bet worth taking with these filmmakers.”  A lower-than-expected total for “Cowboys & Aliens” collided with a bigger draw from “The Smurfs,” a movie that revived characters that debuted more than 50 years ago.  “In the summer, family films are a hot commodity,” Paul Dergarabedian, box office analyst with Hollywood.com, said of the “Smurfs” success.  Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Columbia Pictures, said the “Smurfs” film “performed beyond our expectations.” Columbia Pictures is the unit of Sony Corp that released the movie.  Third place for the weekend went to superhero flick “Captain America: The First Avenger” with $24.9 million in domestic ticket sales during its second weekend in theaters.  “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2,” hitting its third weekend, finished fourth with $21.9 million. The final installment of the popular boy wizard series topped $1 billion in worldwide sales to date, the ninth film in history to hit that mark, distributor Warner Bros. said.  “Crazy, Stupid, Love,” a new romantic comedy starring Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore, took the No. 5 spot in the U.S. and Canada with a solid $19.3 million.  “Captain America” was released by Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom.

While “Cowboys & Aliens” claimed ultimate victory, its performance fell short of pre-release estimates for a big-budget movie with starpower and A-list backing. The film featured Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford as cowboys who take on aliens in the Old West and counted Steven Spielberg among the producers.

66,CMCSA,NBC looks to rebuild quality TV shows under Comcast,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - NBC’s new entertainment chairman said on Monday that new owners Comcast Corp were serious about investing in the struggling TV network, and would be patient about seeing results as it tries to regain its former glory.  Former Showtime chief Robert Greenblatt, who is now NBC’s top programing executive, said he plans to develop original, quality TV shows that appeal to upscale viewers whom advertisers covet.  He also announced plans to reestablish Universal Media Studios — the network’s TV production arm — as a stand-alone entity after it was folded into the NBC network three years ago. He appointed veteran CBS network and cable television executive Bela Bajaria to head up that effort.  “The goals for this season and the next few years (are) to rebuild this schedule. We are going to be very aggressive. We are going to develop upscale original shows,” Greenblatt told reporters at a bi-annual meeting of television critics.  NBC has announced six new dramas and six new comedies for new TV season which starts in September in a bid to reverse its position at the bottom of the four leading U.S. networks.  Greenblatt was hired to lead that charge after cable operator Comcast acquired a controlling stake in NBC in January from General Electric Co..  Asked about the network’s direction under Comcast, Greenblatt said the cable giant had a “genuine excitement in these businesses” compared to a sense under General Electric that network TV was a declining business.  Comcast, Greenblatt said, has “a real enthusiasm for broadcast television and a desire to take this venerable American institution and raise it back up.”  He added that so far Comcast had shown “a desire to invest and be patient about what the bottom line is going to look like for a few years.”  NBC has struggled to find winning scripted shows to take the place of 1990s comedy hits like “Friends”, “Cheers” and “Seinfeld”.  Greenblatt said NBC had signed a development deal with “King of the Hill” and “The Office” creator Greg Daniels for new animated, live action and reality shows and has scheduled a new comedy block on Wednesday evenings.  “Comedy is a giant for us. We have got to have more of it,” he said.  Other new NBC shows include the controversial drama “The Playboy Club” set in the legendary 1960s nightclub, and a remake of the award-winning British crime drama “Prime Suspect” with Maria Bello.  Greenblatt also announced a development deal for the 2012-13 season with “Will & Grace” actor Sean Hayes for a new comedy in which he will star.

67,CMCSA,Broadband closer to advertised speeds: study,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Broadband speeds on average are within 80 percent of what major Internet service providers advertise, a big improvement from two years ago, according to a government study.  The Federal Communications Commission studied cable, DSL and fiber-to-the-home services at 13 top U.S. broadband providers.  The agency found Verizon Communications Inc’s fiber network was best at meeting or exceeding advertised maximum download speeds, while Cablevision Systems Corp was the worst.  Overall, the numbers were a big boost from 2009, when data indicated download speeds were often about half of Internet service providers’ (ISP) maximum advertised speeds.  “Most major ISPs are providing service close to what they’re advertising. This represents a significant improvement over the findings from two years ago when we first shined a light on this issue,” FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said, unveiling the study’s findings at a Best Buy Co store in the District of Columbia.  During peak consumer usage hours when networks are busiest, actual download speeds varied from 114 percent to 54 percent of advertised speed among the different ISPs, the FCC said.  The report comes as the FCC is promoting its National Broadband Plan, unveiled last year. It is a blueprint for expanding coverage, making more airwaves available for mobile services and upgrading Internet speeds up to 25 times recent averages.  The complete findings of the report, its raw data and an FCC-prepared guide for consumers will be made available online. The FCC says the data will help consumers decide which Internet speed, service and provider best meet their needs.  “This report pretty well dispels the myth ... that there’s a huge gap between advertised and actual speeds, and in fact we do pretty well here in the United States,” said Richard Bennett, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.  Not everyone was impressed with the study’s findings.  “This study indicates Comcast, Cox and Verizon FiOS largely perform well, but other companies like Cablevision, AT&T, MediaCom and Frontier all fail to deliver their customers the quality of service promised,” said S. Derek Turner, research director for the public interest group Free Press.  Free Press said ISPs should be held to the same standard as other industries, where giving customers less than what they pay for is a serious offense.  The 13 participating ISPs in the new study included Verizon, which had its fiber and DSL services tested separately, AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable Inc, Cox Communications, Cablevision, Frontier Communications Corp, CenturyLink Inc, Charter Communications Inc, Insight Communications Co, Mediacom Communications, Qwest Communications and Windstream Corp.

69,CMCSA,U.S. broadband closer to advertised speeds-study," * FCC to unveil results of national fixed broadband study   * Most ISPs within 80 percent of advertised speeds   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Broadband speeds are now significantly closer to what Internet service providers advertise than they were in 2009, a study to be released by U.S. communications regulators on Tuesday found.   Cable, DSL and fiber-to-the-home services were examined at 13 top U.S. broadband providers, representing about 86 percent of all U.S. fixed broadband connections.   Actual download speeds provided by the majority of U.S. broadband providers were within 80 percent or better of companies’ advertised speeds even during peak usage hours, according to a draft copy of the report.   The findings are considerably improved from data collected in 2009 for a study on U.S. broadband performance that showed actual download speeds were more often around 50 percent of the Internet service provider’s (ISP) advertised speed, the Federal Communications Commission said.   During peak consumer usage hours when networks are most busy and experience the greatest degradation in speeds, actual download speeds varied from 114 percent of advertised speed to a low of 54 percent of advertised speed among the different ISPs, the draft report said.   The 13 participating ISPs in the new study included Verizon Communications (VZ.N), which had its fiber and DSL services tested separately, AT&T (T.N), Comcast (CMCSA.O), Time Warner TWC.N, Cox Communications, Cablevision CVC.N, Frontier FTR.N, CenturyLink (CTL.N), Charter (CHTR.O), Insight Communications Co, Mediacom Communications, Qwest Communications and Windstream (WIN.O).   Average download speeds as a percentage of those advertised were highest for Verizon’s fiber service and lowest for Cablevision.   Fiber-to-home services achieved the best speeds compared with advertised speeds during the peak hours between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. on weeknights when residential networks tend to be most congested. They met download speeds, on average, of 114 percent of advertised speeds. Cable services met 93 percent of advertised speeds during peak hours, while DSL met 82 percent, the draft copy of the report said.   The study — a recommendation of the FCC’s National Broadband Plan — is the first to provide measurements of residential wireline broadband performance on a national level.   The complete findings of the report, its raw data and an FCC-prepared guide for consumers will be made available online, furthering the agency’s consumer empowerment agenda by helping consumers decide which Internet speed, service and provider best meets their needs, the FCC said.   “We’ve been working to arm consumers with information to help them make smart choices about the broadband service that’s right for them. Informed consumers should lead to a healthier and more competitive broadband market,” said Zachary Katz, chief counsel and senior legal adviser to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski.   Academic researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Georgia Tech as well as technology vendors and consumer groups also worked on the study. Some 6,800 households were selected for testing with 13 different tests conducted multiple times a day over several months in each home to assess broadband performance.   Speed and performance were measured as broadband was delivered to the home, the FCC said, to eliminate the effects of equipment, home networks and other factors on test results.

72,CMCSA,Hulu follows Netflix down original content path,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hulu, the popular TV show website, is trying its hand at commissioning its own shows at a time when its programing partners are starting to trim back the availability of content.  The online video site said on Wednesday it will be airing a six-episode half-hour documentary series called ‘A Day in the Life’ produced by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock this summer.  Spurlock, best known for his food industry documentary ‘Super Size Me’ centers the series around a complete day in the lives of well known people including entrepreneur Richard Branson.  The announcement comes just months after leading online video service Netflix Inc commissioned a 26-part TV series called “House of Cards” staring Kevin Spacey.  TV companies and studios have started to worry they will harm their lucrative multibillion dollar programing relationship with cable and satellite companies if newer popular shows are available for free or cheaply on video sites like Hulu and Netflix.  Last month, News Corp’s Fox Television said that from August 15 only online viewers who have been verified as pay-TV subscribers will be able to view Fox shows like “Glee” and “Bones” for eight days after the shows first air on TV.  Hulu, Fox.com and Dishonline.com will be among the first to participate but the Fox initiative will likely mean some Hulu users, who are used to watching shows the day after they air on TV, will now have to wait longer to view the latest shows. Hulu insiders expect other programmers to experiment with different models of making content available on its free website.  Hulu’s relationship with programmers is unique as it is owned by its primary programmers including News Corp, Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and Providence Equity Partners.  The relationships may become further complicated because Hulu is currently up for sale with companies including Yahoo Inc and Google Inc reported to be interested.  Hulu executive Andy Forssell told Reuters the company will consider making more original shows but sees the Spurlock partnership initially as an experiment.  “We’re talking to a couple of other producers, and there are things in the pipeline, but our priority is thinking in terms of what our audience wants rather than thinking in terms of genres or filling viewer hours,” he said.

The No. 1 U.S. cable operator added 144,000 high-speed Internet customers and 193,000 phone customers. Analysts at Collins Stewart had forecast additions of 120,000 Internet customers and 190,000 phone customers.   But the Philadelphia-based company lost 238,000 basic video customers as it contends with rival phone and satellite companies as well as a weak U.S. economy.   Collins Stewart had forecast losses of 225,000 video customers.   Investors have been concerned pay-TV operators would get hurt by cheaper nimbler Web-based video services like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and even Hulu in which Comcast owns a stake. Time Warner Cable TWC.N, the number 2 cable operator last week said it lost 128,000 video customers during the quarter.   “(Comcast’s) numbers were pretty good though basic video losses remains a concern for investors,” Collins Stewart analyst Thomas Eagan said. “We’re close to the broader pay-TV market being flat to down this quarter due to seasonality and the economy.”   Excluding one-time costs, second quarter profit was 42 cents ahead of the average analyst forecast of 41 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Comcast completed its acquisition of a controlling stake in NBC Universal earlier this year. Including NBC Universal’s results in both 2010 and 2011, Comcast’s revenue rose 9.4 percent to $14.33 billion on a pro-forma basis.   NBC Universal’s total revenue rose 17 percent to $5.18 billion driven by a strong performance across its cable, broadcast, movies and theme parks business.   Standouts for the quarter included a rise of 10 percent in advertising sales at its cable networks, which includes Bravo, MSNBC and USA Network.   The turnaround at its NBC broadcast TV business continued with overall revenue rising 18.5 percent — partly driven by a 7 percent rise in advertising revenue.   Universal Studios also also had a strong quarter thanks to box office hits including ‘Fast Five’ and ‘Bridesmaids’ which was offset by industry wide drop off in DVD sales and lower content licensing revenue.

80,CMCSA,"Comcast sues DirecTV, says false ads lure NFL fans","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable operator, has sued pay TV rival DirecTV, accusing it of misleading consumers by promising “free” broadcasts of National Football League games.  In a complaint filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court in Chicago, Comcast claimed that DirecTV, No. 1 U.S. satellite operator, is poaching customers with false promises about its NFL Sunday Ticket package.  According to Comcast, DirecTV has been recruiting customers from other TV providers by appearing to offer them a chance to watch NFL games outside their local markets for free.  But Comcast said the campaign, which is online, on TV and on the radio, does not disclose that the offer requires customers to sign up for two-year contracts that cost hundreds of dollars, with hefty fees for early termination.  “The claim of ‘free’ is an outright lie,” Comcast said. “This is a false advertising case against a serial false advertiser.”  Comcast added that DirecTV has been disparaging its cable services in a national TV commercial. In Philadelphia, all games by the local Eagles team are available on Comcast, but the ads make it seem that only subscribers of DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket package can view them, Comcast said.  Comcast is seeking to recover DirecTV’s alleged improper profits, as well as punitive damages and a halt to the ads.  DirecTV denied the allegations. “We believe Comcast’s complaint is completely without merit and plan to defend ourselves vigorously,” spokesman Darris Gringeri said.  On Thursday, DirecTV said it signed up 26,000 subscribers — fewer than expected — in the second quarter. The Sunday Ticket package is one of its most popular services and helps it attract new customers.  DirecTV shares fell nearly 7 percent, while Comcast was down 3.6 percent on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon.  The case is Comcast Cable Communications LLC v DirecTV Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 11-05284.

The big-budget, effects-filled prequel to the 1968 classic film about genetically enhanced apes that launch a revolution took the top spot at U.S. and Canadian theaters with a strong $54 million in ticket sales, distributor 20th Century Fox said on Sunday.  The film starring James Franco and John Lithgow also sold $23.4 million in 25 international markets.  The U.S. and Canadian tally topped forecasts for a film that cost about $93 million to make. Positive reviews plus “ground-breaking (effects) technology” and “a very strong emotional story” drew audiences, said Chris Aronson, senior vice president for domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox.  In second place, surprise summer hit “The Smurfs” rang up $21 million domestically plus $45.2 million overseas during the weekend, far surpassing expectations for the family film about little blue cartoon characters made popular in a 1980s television show.  “Cowboys & Aliens,” a big-budget sci-fi Western, finished third with $15.7 million in its second weekend in theaters, which represented a 57 percent drop from one week ago.  The weekend’s other new, wide release film — body-switching comedy “The Change-Up” — finished fourth with domestic sales of $13.5 million, hitting the low end of estimates. The film stars Jason Bateman as a married father who swaps bodies with his single buddy played by Ryan Reynolds.  The movie resonated with women who made up 59 percent of the audience, said a spokeswoman for Universal Studios, the movie studio division of Comcast Corp that released the film.

86,CMCSA,Verizon strike tensions heighten on Day 2,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The second day of a strike by Verizon workers turned ugly after unions accused managers of injuring three workers while driving past picket lines, and the phone giant complained of a spike in network sabotage cases.  About 45,000 workers in Verizon Communications’ U.S. Northeast wireline unit, which provides traditional phone as well as high-speed Internet and FiOS television services, called a strike on Sunday after talks for a new labor contract failed.  The talks resumed on Monday. But the situation outside the negotiation room took a hostile turn.  Verizon said in a statement that some picketing workers were unlawfully blocking Verizon managers’ access to work centers.  A Communications Workers of America spokesman said he was not aware of any unlawful activity by strikers and said the union doesn’t condone such behavior.  However, the CWA said some picketing workers were hurt by Verizon managers’ cars and that one worker was knocked unconscious when he was clipped by the mirror of a manager’s car that was speeding past a picket line.  Verizon said it was working with the police to investigate what happened, but noted that it believed the allegations are “totally inaccurate.”  The CWA also cited a case in which a security guard hired by Verizon had punched a worker and knocked him to the ground on Monday morning. Verizon did not have an immediate comment on this accusation.  Meanwhile, the company said it was working with authorities to investigate at least 12 cases of sabotage, including deliberate cutting of fiber optic lines in 10 places and a case of stolen equipment that caused an outage.  Verizon said it did not know who was responsible for the sabotage, but noted an unusually high number of incidents since Saturday, the last day of the contract. The CWA said it would not condone network sabotage.  Meanwhile, Verizon said customers were seeing minimal impact as managers drafted in to cover for the striking workers were able to handle 75 percent of repair jobs on Sunday.  Verizon is looking to keep costs in check at the wireline business, which has been declining for a decade as customers have disconnected their home phones in favor of cellphone and Internet services.  The CWA and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers have rejected Verizon’s proposals to cut pensions, change work rules and make employees pay more for healthcare.  Verizon closed 5.5 percent lower at $33.12 on the New York Stock Exchange, but still fared better than the broader market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index ended down 6.66 percent after a U.S. debt downgrade spooked investors.  Verizon has been in contract talks with both unions since late June but the unions called a strike on Sunday night after they were unable to reach an agreement by the time the existing labor contract expired.  Verizon spokesman Richard Young said the company’s last strike lasted 18 days in 2000 and cost it $40 million.  Chris King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said in a research note on Monday that this strike would not be as costly since the company’s wireline business has shrunk since 2000.  King estimated the daily costs of the strike would be between $1 million and $2 million. King, who has a “buy” rating on Verizon, said he expects slower-than-usual installations.  Analysts said Verizon shares may have outperformed the market on Monday because the telecommunications sector is seen as a relatively safe haven. They saw the strike as a vital opportunity for the company to push for lower costs in its wireline business.  Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said Verizon could lose some customers at least in the short term due to the strike, to cable rivals such as Cablevision Systems, Comcast Corp, or Time Warner Cable.  “This is medicine they need to take to get this business on a stable footing,” said Moffett who calculated that Verizon’s roughly 1.6 percent return on capital investments pales in comparison to its roughly 7.5 percent cost of capital.  If customers hear of a delay in service installations at Verizon they would likely call a rival instead, he said. “The longer (the strike) goes on the bigger a problem it becomes.”  Verizon shares closed off $1.93, or 5.5 percent, at $33.12, and rival AT&T fell $1.23, or 4.25 percent, to $27.70, both on the NYSE.

88,CMCSA,Tim Allen searches for real men in return to TV,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tim Allen is headed back to television in his first network comedy in 12 years, feeling like the last real man in a woman’s world.  Or at least, that’s what his character Mike is experiencing in “Last Man Standing” — a family man surrounded by three headstrong daughters and a wife who has gone back to work, turning him into the stay at home dad.  The series, making its debut on ABC in October, turns Allen’s former alter ego, construction expert Tim Taylor in his hit 1990s comedy “Home Improvement” on its head.

Allen plays a man working for an outdoor adventure firm, who lives in a world where younger, modern men — and women — are no longer able to do simple, once manly tasks like changing a car tire.

It’s either old school or misogynistic...The men in my life like being able to take care of a home, and when men lose this capacity we are kind of left with nothing to do,” he said.

89,CMCSA,CORRECTED - Tim Allen searches for real men in return to TV," (Corrects byline to Jill Serjeant)   By Jill Serjeant   LOS ANGELES, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Tim Allen is headed back to television in his first network comedy in 12 years, feeling like the last real man in a woman’s world.   Or at least, that’s what his character Mike is experiencing in “Last Man Standing” — a family man surrounded by three headstrong daughters and a wife who has gone back to work, turning him into the stay at home dad.   The series, making its debut on ABC in October, turns Allen’s former alter ego, construction expert Tim Taylor in his hit 1990s comedy “Home Improvement” on its head. It is also one of a slew of upcoming TV comedies that feature emasculated or struggling men in a world where women appear to have the upper hand.   “What I really wanted was to flip flop ‘Home Improvement’ and investigate what it would be like to be around four women who are intelligent, strong fun and loving,” said Allen, whose “Home Improvement” comedy ran from 1991-99.   “Instead of tools (in ‘Home Improvement’) it is sporting goods and gun and ATVs and boats, and I come home to 4 women,” the actor and comedian told television reporters on Monday.

90,CMCSA,"Cable, satellite TV feel economic pinch","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cable and satellite TV providers lost more subscribers than ever in the second quarter, as tough economic conditions and stiffer competition from telephone companies hurt performance.  New York cable operator Cablevision Systems Corp and satellite provider DISH Network Corp were on Tuesday the latest publicly traded pay-TV businesses to post worse-than-expected results, sending their respective shares down even more in a market already spooked by concerns about U.S. poor economic outlook.  Cablevision shares tumbled nearly 13 percent by the close trading, while Dish was down 0.3 percent.  “With all the major publicly traded Pay TV providers having reported their results, Q2 looks to have been the weakest in the industry’s history,” said veteran cable analyst Craig Moffett of Sanford Bernstein.  The U.S. pay-TV sector lost 380,000 subscribers in the quarter, more than double year-ago losses of 160,000, according to Bernstein estimates.  Satellite players Dish and larger rival DirecTV Group had their first-ever quarter of combined losses of 109,000 subscribers.  “There is no question that the pay TV industry growth has slowed dramatically,” said Joe Clayton, chief executive of Dish Network, which lost 135,000 customers during the quarter. “The market is becoming increasingly saturated. Industry double-digit growth rates have passed and there will be slower growth as the economy rebounds and new home formations grow.  After several decades of steady growth, the pay-TV sector has run into the perfect storm of a weak economy, poor housing market and competition from new entrants such as phone companies and cheaper online options such as Netflix Inc and Hulu.  All the major publicly traded cable companies Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable Inc, Charter Communications Inc and Cablevision lost subscribers. But phone company Verizon Communications Inc added 184,000 FiOS TV subscribers, while AT&T Inc added 202,000 U-Verse TV customers.  As the industry matures, companies are resorting to aggressive marketing tactics to attract new users. DirecTV has been giving away its exclusive NFL Sunday Ticket package to subscribers who switch from a rival. Typically, the package of out-of-market football games costs as much as $350 per year.  The housing market was highlighted as another reason for customer losses by Cablevision Chief Operating Officer Tom Rutledge on a call with analysts.  “There is very little housing growth going on right now and there is actually a high vacancy rate. All of that hurts the residential business at the moment,” he said.  New York-based Cablevision lost 23,000 video customers in the quarter.  Besides the competition from phone companies, there has long been speculation cable TV is suffering an assault from new types of online video services from Netflix, Hulu and expected services from Amazon.com Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp.  The phenomenon has been described as ‘cord-cutting,’ where customers drop having any cable service in favor of Web video streaming services that are either free or cost a tenth of the typical video package.  Netflix has added more than 1.8 million subscribers in the second quarter for a total of 24.6 million subscribers. This makes it the second largest video subscription service after Comcast.  “A resurrection of the cord cutting thesis seems almost inevitable here notwithstanding all the evidence that it is the tremendous stress on consumers, particularly at the low end of the market, that is the root cause for the weakness,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Moffett in a client note.

91,CMCSA,"Gloria Steinem hopes for TV boycott of ""Playboy Club""","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Veteran women’s rights campaigner Gloria Steinem said on Friday she hoped TV viewers would boycott “The Playboy Club”, calling the 1960s nightclubs tacky and far from the glamorous places depicted in the show.  “Clearly ‘The Playboy Club’ is not going to be accurate. It was the tackiest place on earth. It was not glamorous at all,” Steinem told Reuters in an interview.  Steinem, one of America’s leading crusaders for women’s rights for 40 years, went undercover to work as a Bunny at the New York City Playboy Club in 1963 and wrote a ground-breaking expose about the onerous conditions for women who worked there.  “When I was working there and writing the expose, one of the things they had to change because of my expose was that they required all the Bunnies, who were just waitresses, to have an internal exam and a test for venereal disease,” she said.  Steinem said she regards the Emmy Award-winning drama “Mad Men”, which is also set in the 1960s as “a net plus, because it shows the world of the early 1960s with some realism.”  But she added; “I expect that ‘The Playboy Club’ will be a net minus and I hope people boycott it. It’s just not telling the truth about the era.”  “The Playboy Club”, set in the first Playboy Club in Chicago, debuts in September as one of the centerpieces of NBC’s new fall television season.  Speaking to TV reporters last week in Los Angeles, network executives, producers and the show’s cast all rejected opinions by critics who feel the series will glamorize the porn industry and is demeaning to modern women.  NBC entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt called the show a “really fun soap opera”, while executive producer Chad Hodge told TV reporters that the program was “all about empowering these women to be whatever they want to be.”  One NBC affiliate, in Salt Lake City, has already said it will not broadcast the show but NBC says it does not expect others to follow.  Steinem, 77, said on Friday that it was important to reject the TV series, despite the fact that it is set 40 years ago.  “It normalizes a passive dominant idea of gender. So it normalizes prostitution and male dominance...I just know that over the years, women have called me and told me horror stories of what they experienced at the Playboy Club and at the Playboy Mansion,” she said.

94,CMCSA,"Disney rides resurgent ads, but economic clouds loom"," * Ad spending on cable channels expected to boost quarter   * Economic outlook may spook consumers on which Disney depends   * Weaker economy could slow theme park traffic   * Latest Pirates installment generated massive sales    By Lisa Richwine	   LOS ANGELES, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street investors may look past an advertising rebound and a strong box office for Walt Disney Co and instead zero in on the outlook for its sprawling theme park unit as economic uncertainty grips consumers.	   Disney, whose shares are down nearly 25 percent since a rare earnings miss for the fiscal second quarter, is expected to confirm trends established by Comcast Corp , Time Warner Inc and CBS Corp , which beat Wall Street forecasts with a mix of content licensing deals, movie box office receipts and strong ad growth. 	   Analysts predict the operator of TV networks ESPN and ABC, a movie studio, cruise line and theme parks on three continents, will report a rebound in results this quarter.	   The rebound will likely be due to a healthy advertising market that fueled growth at the ESPN sports network and other cable channels that make up a large chunk of the company’s business.	   “The trends (at the cable networks) have been strong. I’d expect that to continue,” Morningstar analyst Michael Corty said.	   But in view of S&P’s unprecedented downgrade of the long-term U.S. credit rating, investors may focus more on how a bleak economic outlook might spook the consumers on which Disney depends for everything from movie receipts to theme park spending and merchandise sales.	   “A weaker economy could slow theme park traffic (which is a key risk in our opinion),” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Drew Crum wrote in a note to clients.	   The just-ended quarter should get a lift from the heavy spring travel period around the Easter holiday plus the new Disney Dream cruise ship, analysts said. Investors will look for comments from executives about bookings for the coming quarters amid concerns about weak economic growth, high unemployment and the chance of another recession.	   Disney’s studio division, often a swing factor for results, generated massive international sales from the fourth “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie, but faces tough comparisons with “Toy Story 3” last year, Nomura Securities analyst Michael Nathanson said in a research note. Most of the company’s major movies for this year already have hit theaters.	   Disney is expected to report fiscal third quarter earnings of 73 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue is forecast to rise 4.5 percent from a year earlier to $10.5 billion.

95,CMCSA,Verizon strike tensions heighten on Day 2,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The second day of a strike by Verizon workers turned ugly after union representatives accused managers of injuring three workers while driving past picket lines, and the phone giant complained of a spike in network sabotage cases.  About 45,000 workers in Verizon Communications’ Northeast wireline unit, which provides traditional phone as well as high-speed Internet and FiOS television services, called a strike on Sunday after talks for a new labor contract failed.  The talks resumed on Monday. But the situation outside the negotiation room took a hostile turn.  Verizon complained of network sabotage cases in the same statement where it said some picketing workers were unlawfully blocking Verizon managers’ access to work centers.  A spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America, representing 35,000 of the strikers, said the union “does not condone illegal action of any kind.” The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, representing 10,000 strikers, also said members “are expected to obey the law.”  However, the CWA said some picketing workers were hurt by Verizon managers’ cars and that one worker was knocked unconscious when he was clipped by the mirror of a manager’s car that was speeding past a picket line.  Verizon said it was working with the police to investigate what happened, but noted that it believed the allegations are “totally inaccurate.”  The CWA also cited a case in which a security guard hired by Verizon had punched a worker and knocked him to the ground on Monday morning. Verizon did not have an immediate comment on this accusation.  Meanwhile, the company said it was working with authorities to investigate at least 12 cases of sabotage, including deliberate cutting of fiber optic lines in 10 places and a case of stolen equipment that caused an outage.  Verizon said it did not know who was responsible for the sabotage, but noted an unusually high number of incidents since Saturday, the last day of the contract. The CWA said it would not condone network sabotage.  Meanwhile, Verizon said customers were seeing minimal impact as managers drafted in to cover for the striking workers were able to handle 75 percent of repair jobs on Sunday.  Verizon is looking to keep costs in check at the wireline business, which has been declining for a decade as customers have disconnected their home phones in favor of cellphone and Internet services.  The CWA and IBEW have rejected Verizon’s proposals to cut pensions, change work rules and make employees pay more for healthcare.  Verizon closed 5.5 percent lower at $33.12 on the New York Stock Exchange, but still fared better than the broader market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index ended down 6.66 percent after a U.S. debt downgrade spooked investors.  Verizon has been in contract talks with both unions since late June but the unions called a strike on Sunday night after they were unable to reach an agreement by the time the existing labor contract expired.  Verizon spokesman Richard Young said the company’s last strike lasted 18 days in 2000 and cost it $40 million.  Chris King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said in a research note on Monday that this strike would not be as costly since the company’s wireline business has shrunk since 2000.  King estimated the daily costs of the strike would be between $1 million and $2 million. King, who has a “buy” rating on Verizon, said he expects slower-than-usual installations.  Analysts said Verizon shares may have outperformed the market on Monday because the telecommunications sector is seen as a relatively safe haven. They saw the strike as a vital opportunity for the company to push for lower costs in its wireline business.  Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said Verizon could lose some customers at least in the short term due to the strike, to cable rivals such as Cablevision Systems, Comcast Corp, or Time Warner Cable.  “This is medicine they need to take to get this business on a stable footing,” said Moffett who calculated that Verizon’s roughly 1.6 percent return on capital investments pales in comparison to its roughly 7.5 percent cost of capital.  If customers hear of a delay in service installations at Verizon they would likely call a rival instead, he said. “The longer (the strike) goes on the bigger a problem it becomes.”  Verizon shares closed off $1.93, or 5.5 percent, at $33.12, and rival AT&T fell $1.23, or 4.25 percent, to $27.70, both on the NYSE.

99,CMCSA,Republican donors hedging 2012 election bets,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hundreds of Republican donors, including some party kingmakers, are hedging their bets by donating to more than one presidential candidate, reflecting the instability of the field looking to unseat President Barack Obama in 2012.  More than 300 donors gave at least $200 to more than one Republican hopeful during the first half of 2011, according to a report issued on Thursday by the Center for Responsive Politics. The most common double donation was to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty.  “Donors motivated by ideological reasons are not sure who to support,” said Michael Beckel, an analyst at the center.  “There are also donors who want to make an investment, and they want the access and other perks that can come with making a sizable contribution to a candidate.”  At least 66 donors gave to both Romney and Pawlenty, including Texas billionaires Bob Perry and Harold Simmons — who each gave $5,000 to Pawlenty and $2,500 to Romney, according to the analysis.  That duo gave financial backing to the infamous “Swift Boat” advertisements in 2004 questioning Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry’s Vietnam War service.  Romney leads most national polls and the all-important money race heading into Thursday night’s debate in Iowa.  Romney, a co-founder of the private equity firm Bain Capital, raised $18 million in the second quarter, while most other Republican presidential candidates trailed, reporting sums near the $4 million range.  Meanwhile, Obama posted $86 million, when combined with funds raised through the Democratic National Committee.  Pawlenty has probably spent the most time and resources so far in Iowa, and is counting on momentum from a Saturday straw poll to lift his campaign out of single digits in national polls.  In a surprising finding, about two dozen donors gave at least $1,000 to both Romney and Obama. They include Gretchen Burke, the chief operating officer at Comcast Corp and Michael Troy, a Goldman Sachs executive.

The revival of the classic sci-fi franchise beat four new releases to hang on to the top ranking at U.S. and Canadian theaters for the second straight week, according to studio estimates released on Sunday. Civil Rights-era drama “The Help” finished a strong second with $25.5 million over three days, beating studio forecasts.   The U.S. and Canadian audience for “Apes” shrunk 50 percent from its opening weekend. The drop was “a fantastic hold” against four new films that grossed a combined $60 million, said Chris Aronson, senior vice president for domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox, which distributed the movie. “Apes” brought in a total of $68 million globally for the weekend.   Strong reviews and a rare A+ rating from audience-survey firm CinemaScore propelled “The Help,” a film based on a best-selling book by Kathryn Stockett. The movie chronicles the lives of wealthy white women in Mississippi and their black housekeepers. It cost about $25 million to produce.   “The Help” appealed to broad audiences across the country and drew positive responses from men as well as the core audience of women, said Dave Hollis, executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution at Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), which distributed the DreamWorks-produced film.   “This is a most pleasant surprise,” Hollis said of the opening weekend sales. Disney expects to add another 100 to 200 additional theaters after the early success sparked more interest, he said. The film was showing in 2,534 theaters over the opening weekend after debuting on Wednesday. Over five days, the film grossed $35.4 million.   In third place for the weekend, horror flick and new release “Final Destination 5,” in which survivors of a bridge collapse try to cheat death, generated $18.4 million domestically. That hit the low end of studio forecasts.   Surprise summer hit “The Smurfs” took fourth place on the domestic charts with $13.5 million during its third weekend in theaters, plus an impressive $60 million haul in international markets for the live-action and animated family film.   Comedy “30 Minutes or Less,” starring Jesse Eisenberg, finished fifth with $13 million at the domestic box office. The movie tells the tale of two criminals who kidnap a pizza delivery boy, strap a bomb to his chest and order him to rob a bank. The production budget was $28 million.   The weekend’s other new release, “Glee: The 3D Concert Movie,” failed to crack the top 10 with $5.7 million domestically, making it No. 11 for the weekend. The film pairs song-and-dance performances from a “Glee” concert tour with commentary from fans of the hit television show about an Ohio high school’s show choir. The movie cost $9 million to make and is scheduled for just two weeks in theaters.   “Final Destination 5” was distributed by Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp (6758.T) (SNE.N), released “30 Minutes or Less” and “The Smurfs.”   “Planet of the Apes” and “Glee: the 3D Concert Movie” were released by 20th Century Fox, a unit of News Corp (NWSA.O).

105,CMCSA,Cable execs wary as Google acquires Motorola boxes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The pay-TV industry is nervously watching Google Inc’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility — the largest supplier of set-top boxes to consumers’ homes.  While the mobile device business of Motorola Mobility has naturally attracted most of the attention, cable executives immediately noticed that for them the deal means working with a company they have clashed with in the past on a range of issues from so-called net neutrality to piracy.  “There’s a general malaise toward Google with us and I’m sure with the other cable companies,” said one executive at a large cable provider who asked not to be named as his company would likely still have to deal with Google. “If this was HP or Microsoft I’m sure we’d have been indifferent.”  Cable and phone companies have viewed Google suspiciously ever since the No. 1 search engine used its muscle to get regulators to back ‘net neutrality’ rules that would prevent Internet service providers from rationing access to their networks. The cable and ISPs wanted to be able to manage congestion by blocking certain traffic or charging for passing through their pipes, for example.  Pay-TV providers are also concerned about potential privacy invasions since Google could theoretically use the set-top boxes to mine subscribers’ personal data to sell advertising.  “If they have a box in the majority of U.S. homes, there’s going to be a need to ensure that privacy isn’t abused,” said another cable executive.”  Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable, the two largest U.S. cable providers, among others, both use Motorola boxes, meaning the deal now gives Google immediate access to millions of living rooms across the country.  Though many analysts described Motorola’s set-top box business as an afterthought, Google has shown its desire to enter the pay-TV business through last fall’s launch of the underwhelming Google TV set-top box made by Logitech. The company also acquired a small Web DVR software company called Sage TV.  The proposing of business models on the part of technology companies like Google, Apple Inc and Amazon.com that could potentially unravel the cable’s industry’s cozy $100 billion relationship with programmers is another concern.  “Here’s Google, the company most frequently mentioned as a potential disrupter of the pay-TV ecosystem, suddenly finding itself in the awkward position as one of the pay-TV industry’s largest suppliers,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Bernstein Research.  If Google’s technology ends up inside pay-TV customers’ living rooms that could give the technology giant some much needed leverage in negotiations.  “They are highly scared of folks coming in and developing a direct relationship with their subscribers and driving ad and application revenue where the operator is not at the center of that subscriber relationship,” said a senior executive at another supplier to the cable industry.  Cable insiders point out that the majority of Motorola’s set-top boxes in North America are designed to follow an industrywide standard, so Google would not have as much freedom as it seems to change the boxes.  “Google can’t suddenly come in and say ‘get rid of all that software and use our software’ because Motorola’s customers demand that Motorola follow the standards the cable industry has set in place,” said an executive at a set-top maker who did not want to be named commenting publicly about a rival.  Not all cable insiders view Google’s potential arrival as a bad thing, however. Some insiders told Reuters that the search giant’s technology prowess could help accelerate updates to the set-top box for a fast-changing pay-TV world which faces competition from numerous online video rivals such as Netflix Inc and Hulu.  But the cable industry’s biggest hope — and defense — is that the set-top box will eventually lose its relevance as more functions are shifted online or into the computing “cloud”.  New York-based Cablevision Systems Corp has released a remote storage digital video recorder which completely gets rid of the need for a traditional DVR box made by suppliers like Motorola. Time Warner Cable is likely to be next and other cable companies will follow.

The proposing of business models on the part of technology companies like Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) that could potentially unravel the cable’s industry’s cozy $100 billion relationship with programmers is another concern.   “Here’s Google, the company most frequently mentioned as a potential disrupter of the pay-TV ecosystem, suddenly finding itself in the awkward position as one of the pay-TV industry’s largest suppliers,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Bernstein Research.   If Google’s technology ends up inside pay-TV customers’ living rooms that could give the technology giant some much needed leverage in negotiations.   “They are highly scared of folks coming in and developing a direct relationship with their subscribers and driving ad and application revenue where the operator is not at the center of that subscriber relationship,” said a senior executive at another supplier to the cable industry.   Cable insiders point out that the majority of Motorola’s set-top boxes in North America are designed to follow an industrywide standard, so Google would not have as much freedom as it seems to change the boxes.   “Google can’t suddenly come in and say ‘get rid of all that software and use our software’ because Motorola’s customers demand that Motorola follow the standards the cable industry has set in place,” said an executive at a set-top maker who did not want to be named commenting publicly about a rival.   Not all cable insiders view Google’s potential arrival as a bad thing, however. Some insiders told Reuters that the search giant’s technology prowess could help accelerate updates to the set-top box for a fast-changing pay-TV world which faces competition from numerous online video rivals such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Hulu.   But the cable industry’s biggest hope — and defense — is that the set-top box will eventually lose its relevance as more functions are shifted online or into the computing “cloud”.   New York-based Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N has released a remote storage digital video recorder which completely gets rid of the need for a traditional DVR box made by suppliers like Motorola. Time Warner Cable is likely to be next and other cable companies will follow.

107,CMCSA,Box office heading toward record despite economy,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A popular boy wizard, comic-book heroes and some foul-mouthed women are leading Hollywood toward a record-breaking summer despite the sour economy and high unemployment resulting in tightened consumer spending.  Underscoring the notion that movies are recession-proof, U.S. and Canadian ticket sales are expected to finish nearly 5 percent higher than a year ago thanks to the “Harry Potter” finale and other big-budget sequels plus raunchy adult comedies such as “Bridesmaids.”  Summer ticket sales in the domestic (U.S. and Canadian) market through last weekend stood at an estimated $3.8 billion. Attendance was up 2.8 percent, though that was compared with last year’s 13-year low, according to figures from tracking firm Hollywood.com. Premium charges for 3D films and slightly higher average ticket prices helped raise revenue.  “If we keep at this pace, we should wind up with $4.5 billion,” the highest summer total ever, said Paul Dergarabedian, box office analyst with Hollywood.com.  The summer film season — usually measured from early May through Labor Day weekend in September — represents the most lucrative time of the year for studios, providing as much as 40 percent of annual box-office dollars.  Still, year-to-date box office revenue is down 4 percent from 2010 while attendance has shrunk 5 percent after weak winter and spring ticket sales. Studios need a strong holiday season to regain lost ground at a time when the U.S. economy is sputtering.  “Overall I think people are feeling good” about the summer results, said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp that rang up big sales with family film “The Smurfs.”  The strong summer box office belies recent data on consumer spending from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which showed that Americans spent less and saved more money in June, just as the summer season was moving into full swing. It also goes against concerns among economists about the possibility of a double-dip recession brought on by high unemployment and anemic economic growth.  But moviegoing, which is one of the cheaper entertainment options for consumers, usually holds up in weak economies, industry players said. For instance, in summer 2008, the most recent comparable period to this summer in terms of the macro-economy, domestic box-office sales gained 0.5 percent year-over-year, though that was largely due to ticket price increases. Attendance actually fell 3.7 percent that summer.  Box-office success is tied more to the quality of the films than economic trends, Dergarabedian said. “Good movies are recession-proof,” he said.  Chris Aronson, senior vice president for domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox, added that “lower-quality 3D films could be under pressure as audiences become more discerning.” Overall box-office totals for 2011 “will probably get to a position where we are level with last year,” he said.  This summer’s standout performers thus far include “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,” which broke records worldwide and was among three movies to sell more than $1 billion globally. The others were the third “Transformers” and fourth “Pirates of the Caribbean.”  “The one consistent area of success is still in the big franchise and in the big sequel,” said Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, a unit of Viacom Inc.  Foul-mouthed women scored big with better-than-expected sales for “Bridesmaids” and “Bad Teacher.” Another adult comedy, “The Hangover 2,” also was a hit.  Superheroes abounded on screens — to mixed results. “Captain America: The First Avenger” and “Thor” performed well while “The Green Lantern” fizzled.  Four of the five highest-grossing summer 2011 films were offered in 3D, as were several other summer flicks. But filmgoers often decided to live with two dimensions, sparking a debate in the industry over whether the appetite for 3D movies had petered out.  “Avatar” director James Cameron recently urged Hollywood to make sure 3D movies provided a quality experience to justify the higher price.  “This is a good moment for Hollywood to acknowledge that they have to try harder to maintain the idea that 3D is a premium experience. We can’t take cheap routes,” Cameron told Reuters in an interview.  Walt Disney Co’s revered Pixar animation unit for the first time stumbled with critics who panned “Cars 2.” The film has proven resilient with audiences, however, surpassing the original’s box-office tally with more than $476 million in gross sales worldwide.  But the strong performance of sequels this summer has a downside.  “There really weren’t any new franchises created ... This summer may wind up with record gross (box office), but I don’t know if enough seeds were planted for the future,” said Brandon Gray, president of industry tracking firm boxofficemojo.com.  From that perspective, the rest of the year appears ominous for studios, with sequels to “Twilight,” “Mission Impossible,” “Happy Feet” and “Alvin and the Chipmunks” all set for release.

109,CMCSA,'Real Housewives' to be tweaked after Armstrong suicide," * Producers have already begun re-editing the show   * Bravo still undecided on Sept. 5 premiere   LOS ANGELES, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Reality TV show “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” is being re-edited following the suicide of Russell Armstrong in a strong indication that the network plans to go ahead with the second season.   But Bravo president Frances Berwick told showbusiness paper Daily Variety that no decision has yet been made about whether the drama-filled program will premiere as planned on Sept. 5.   A source who knew of the network’s plans said the re-editing had already begun.   Bravo and Berwick declined to say which parts of the show — filmed earlier in the summer — were being tweaked, but they are likely to involve appearances by Russell Armstrong, whose crumbling marriage to “Housewives” star Taylor Armstrong was expected to be a dominant theme of the upcoming season.   The 47 year-old venture capitalist committed suicide by hanging himself with an electrical cord on Monday, a month after his wife filed for divorce citing verbal and physical abuse.   Armstrong also was facing huge financial problems and his mother said this week that her son feared the new season was going to “crucify” him.   The original second season opener, which was given in advance to TV journalists, had Taylor Armstrong talking about being in marriage counseling and shopping for sexy underwear in a bid to improve their relationship.   “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” features the lives of six wealthy women and is one of the most popular of the drama-filled “Real Housewives” franchises.   Armstrong’s suicide stunned Hollywood, and claims by friends and family members that his suicide was prompted partly by the pressure of being on the show have only attracted more interest in the new season.

110,CMCSA,"Sprint, cable operators in Clearwire talks: sources","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N) has held talks with cable partners about supporting their loss-making Clearwire Corp CLWR.O wireless venture in the face of increasing competition from bigger rivals, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The shares of Clearwire, which is currently looking for about $900 million in funding, rose 30 percent after Bloomberg reported cable operators with a minority stake in Clearwire were in talks with Sprint — Clearwire’s majority owner and its biggest customer.  But sources told Reuters any decisions about measures such as new funding would depend on the outcome of AT&T Inc’s (T.N) efforts to create a much bigger rival by buying T-Mobile USA, according two people who spoke to Reuters on condition they would not be named because the talks were private.  “It’s clear that something will have to be done eventually, but nothing is imminent,” said one of the people, who stressed the AT&T deal would be the catalyst rather than Clearwire’s financial or operating struggles.  The other person described the chances of a Clearwire investment deal anytime soon as a “low probability.”  While the AT&T/T-Mobile USA deal could be approved by the end of the first quarter of next year, it is likely Sprint will want to get the Clearwire situation resolved before October 7, when it is due to announce a major network upgrade.  All the cable partners in the Clearwire venture — Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and Bright House Networks LLC — were involved in the talks, according to the people. Clearwire, Sprint and the cable companies declined comment for the story.  Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. mobile service has been speaking out against AT&T’s $39 billion plan to buy T-Mobile USA, a Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE) unit, and has urged regulators to stop the deal because it would hurt competition.  Bloomberg, also citing unnamed sources, reported Cox Communications Inc COXC.UL and Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N also participated in the talks, which it said involve various scenarios, including a Clearwire buyout or an investment in the company through Sprint.  Clearwire announced earlier this month it was looking for funding to help upgrade its network with Long Term Evolution (LTE) — an emerging high-speed technology.  Clearwire shares rose 70 cents, or 30 percent, to about $3 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading, while the shares of Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint were up 3 cents, or almost 1 percent, to $3.52 on New York Stock Exchange.

The drama chronicles the relationships between white women in Mississippi and their black housekeepers in the 1960s.  The movie’s North American (U.S. and Canadian) receipts slipped 21 percent from its debut a week earlier, an impressive hold and more than enough to beat underwhelming performances from four new films. To date, “The Help” has beat expectations by ringing up a total of $71.8 million.  “We always hoped ‘The Help’ would be a breath of fresh air after a busy, sequel-filled, smash-‘em-up summer. The way the public’s embracing it indicates that is indeed the case,” said Dave Hollis, executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution at Disney.  Last weekend’s box-office leader, sci-fi movie “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” fell to second place with a projected $16.3 million domestically during its third weekend of release. Total North American sales now stand at $133.8 million for the latest take on the classic tale about genetically enhanced chimps that launch a revolution.  Of the new releases, “Spy Kids: All the Time in the World,” performed the best at No. 3 with $12 million, hitting the low end of forecasts. “Given the marketplace this weekend, I’m okay with that number,” said Erik Lomis, president of distribution for The Weinstein Co, which released the film.  The fourth “Spy Kids” movie was presented in “4D,” with scratch-and-sniff cards to add scents throughout, and was aimed at children ages 12 and younger. “It plays and it delivers to that audience,” Lomis said.  Two remakes of 1980s films — “Conan the Barbarian” and “Fright Night” — fell flat.  “Conan the Barbarian,” a reboot of the film that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger’s career, was the No. 4 movie for the weekend with $10 million, short of forecasts in the low- to-mid teens.

It stars Colin Farrell and Anton Yelchin and was targeted partly at young adults, an audience with “a finicky nature,” said Disney’s Hollis.

The plans would modernize the “universal service fund” by shifting its focus to broadband service from phone lines.   Phone companies weighed in last month with their blueprint that would start redirecting the fund beginning in 2012.   The National Cable and Telecommunications Association and the American Cable Association said in a letter to the FCC this week that the phone industry’s proposal falls short.   It fails to constrain costs, gives an unfair advantage to incumbent phone companies, and deprives consumers of potentially superior service, the cable groups said in the letter.   NCTA serves as the chief lobbying arm of the cable industry representing networks and operators like Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable TWC.N, while ACA represents independent companies providing broadband service to 7.6 million subscribers.   Of particular concern to the cable groups was a provision of the plan that gives incumbent carriers first dibs at monies from the fund.   “Support should be awarded to the most efficient provider in a supported area, not simply the one that has been there the longest,” the groups said in the letter.   The cable industry called for “no artificial advantage associated with incumbency and no disadvantage associated with using a particular technology.”   More than 20 million Americans are without access to high-speed Internet.   The phone companies’ plan — backed by Verizon Communications (VZ.N), AT&T Inc (T.N), Frontier Communications Corp FTR.N, CenturyLink Inc (CTL.N), FairPoint Communications Inc FRP.O and Windstream Corp (WIN.O) — would support fixed and mobile broadband, and complete the transition of the universal fund to a broadband focus in 2016.   “The commission should not let its reform efforts once again be stymied by groups that are more dedicated to protecting their individual interests, rather than working constructively toward a realistic solution,” David Fish, spokesman for the six phone companies, said in a statement.   The current patchwork of programs in the FCC’s fund is paid for by fees added to consumers’ telephone bills and annually provides $4.5 billion from the overall $8 billion fund to subsidize telephone service in areas otherwise deemed too costly to serve.   The wasteful spending and inefficiencies present in the program have allowed some telecom providers to receive subsidies in areas where competition exists — at odds with the program’s purpose of helping consumers in areas where it is not economically feasible to offer service.   The cable groups said long overdue reforms of the program should include a cap on the size of the fund and a stringent adherence to this budget.   Any proposal needs to better ensure that funding for the buildout of broadband networks is concentrated in areas where it does not make economic sense for private investment, NCTA said in a filing with the FCC.

118,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-Brightcove files for $50 mln public offering," * Seeks to trade under BCOV on Nasdaq   * Lost $9.8 mln in first half of 2011   NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Digital media company Brightcove Inc filed with regulators for a public offering of up to $50 million as it seeks to expand its offering of online video and app services for business clients.   The Cambridge, Massachusetts company is best known for providing an online video platform for a scores of media and marketing clients betting on continuing rise in the use of video as a communication tool by a wide range of companies.   But the company, which has grown revenue since being founded in 2004, is still losing money according to its S1 regulatory filing on Wednesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.   For 2010 it grew revenue to $43.7 million but lost $17.8 million.   In the six months to June 30, it lost $9.8 million on revenue of $28.4 million.   It has applied to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “BCOV”.   The offering is being run by Morgan Stanley & Co and Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. RBC Capital Markets, Pacific Crest Securities and Raymond James & Associates are acting as co-managers.    Reuters reported last year that Brightcove was planning for an IPO in 2011. The company has so far raised about $100 million in venture funding from backers including Accel Partners, General Catalyst Group and Brookside Capital Partners.    Rivals include Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) theplatform unit, but Brightcove Chief Executive and founder Jeremy Allaire has said the company expects competition from much larger companies, including Google Inc (GOOG.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Akamai (AKAM.O).

120,CMCSA,"""The Help"" holds on at top of storm-hit box office","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The hard-working maids of “The Help” hung on to the top of a storm-battered box office over the weekend and beat a trio of new releases with $14.3 million in domestic ticket sales, studio estimates released on Sunday showed.  Hurricane Irene forced the closure of theaters in big markets such as New York and kept moviegoers home along a broad stretch of the East Coast. Domestic ticket sales came in 23 percent lower than the same weekend a year earlier, according to figures from Hollywood.com.  “The Help,” a drama about black housekeepers in Civil Rights-era Mississippi, took the top spot in the North American (U.S. and Canadian) market for the second straight weekend. The DreamWorks-produced film adaptation of a best-selling novel by Kathryn Stockett has grossed $96.6 million since it opened three weeks ago, distributor Walt Disney Co said.  The bad weather did not help new releases on a late summer weekend that was expected to be slow even without a major storm.  Action movie “Columbiana” debuted in second place with an estimated $10.3 million, ahead of studio forecasts of around $8 million. The film features actress Zoe Saldana as a woman who witnesses her parents’ murder as a child in Bogota and grows up to be an assassin seeking revenge.  “The picture is off to a good start, storm or no storm,” said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp that released the film.  Horror movie “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” starring Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce, finished third with domestic sales of $8.7 million.  “Our key large urban East Coast markets were really killed” by the hurricane, said Bob Berney, president of theatrical distribution for FilmDistrict. For example, the movie took in nearly $21,000 at one Manhattan theater on Friday and zero on Saturday, Berney said.  Paul Dergarabedian, box office analyst with Hollywood.com, said there was “no question” the hurricane had a “significant negative impact” on ticket sales.  “That said, this was never preordained to be a blockbuster kind of weekend and late August is typically a slowdown period for the summer movie season,” he said.  Sci-fi movie “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” finished fourth with $8.7 million, bringing its domestic total to $148.5 million over four weeks. Internationally, the film about rampaging, genetically enhanced chimps has grossed $158.5 million.  Combining domestic and international markets, “Apes” has climbed to a strong $307 million to date. It was distributed by 20th Century Fox, a unit of News Corp.  A new comedy, “Our Idiot Brother,” landed in fifth place for the weekend with $6.6 million domestically. The movie stars Paul Rudd as an underachieving but big-hearted sibling who disrupts the lives of his three sisters.  The film likely felt the brunt of Irene’s box-office punch as the movie had been expected to perform well in New York, said Erik Lomis, president of distribution for The Weinstein Co, which released the movie. “We got hit hardest in our best area.

127,CMCSA,"U.S. vote in 2012 will be record, $6 billion election","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Forget the struggling economy. There’s one U.S. industry — Big Politics — that is looking ahead to a record year in 2012.  The U.S. elections will be the most expensive ever, with a total price tag of $6 billion or even more, fueled by millions of dollars in unrestricted donations as Republicans and Democrats vie for control of the White House, Congress and state governments.  “It’s safe to say that, given that we had a $5 billion cycle in 2008, it will certainly be more than that and very likely over $6 billion, which is just an astonishing growth rate,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending.  The cost of the election is surprising given that only the Republican Party is holding presidential primaries, unlike in 2008 when both parties had expensive contests to find a candidate.  One reason it will be so costly this time around is the fundraising power of leading candidates, even with a sputtering economy and high unemployment. President Barack Obama is expected to at least match the record $760 million he raised to win the White House in 2008 and even hit $1 billion.  Obama’s Republican challenger will need a similar war chest to compete. Two of the Republican frontrunners, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and Texas Governor Rick Perry, are fundraising heavyweights.  A third Republican, Michele Bachmann, also can bring in the cash and was the House of Representatives’ best fundraiser in 2010.  Fundraising in congressional and local races is also mounting with 14 months to go before the November 6 elections. The money to be hauled in and spent in the overall 2012 campaign is equivalent to the GDP of a small country like Nicaragua.  The 2012 candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives reported raising $295.2 million in the first six months of 2011, the highest total ever reported for the first half of a non-election year.  Candidates will use the money to pay for staff and travel, but if previous campaigns are any measure they will spend about half on advertising. That is a bonanza for television and radio networks, especially in the hardest fought states and areas with competitive Senate and House races.  Analysts forecast perhaps billions of dollars in advertising spending, boosting revenues at a range of U.S. media companies. TV networks like CBS, Fox News, ABC, NBC and CNN will be the biggest benefactors.  But while presidential and congressional candidates cannot run a race without a big checkbook, neither party is seen as gaining a major advantage from the current spending splurge.  More money does not always mean victory, said Michael Malbin, executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute.  “You can point to election after election where a person spent more and spent more, and the more the voters heard of that person, the more that person went down in the polls,” Malbin said. “If the person is selling horse meat the people won’t eat it.”  The cost of U.S. elections has risen steadily but this will be the first presidential race since the landmark “Citizens United” 2010 Supreme Court ruling, which ended most restrictions on donations by corporations and unions.  It also fostered the creation of Super PACs, fundraising committees that can spend money to support a candidate but cannot officially coordinate with campaigns.  The Super PACs worry ethics watchdogs, who say the increased leverage of big donors is limiting the influence of average voters on politics.  In particular, the need to get big donations early in campaigns is keeping candidates with fewer donors from even running for office, particularly in congressional races. And the reign of big money in politics inevitably will give too much clout to big donors, activists say.  “Those who fund the candidates are the ones who get listened to,” said Meredith McGehee, policy director at the Campaign Legal Center, which works on campaign finance and government ethics. “And a Super PAC and others that can deliver millions of dollars, any supposed notion that they are not going to have a leg up is wrong. It’s not just a leg up, it’s going to be that the system runs for them.”  All of the leading Republican candidates have Super PACs.  A half dozen are backing Perry, who has rocketed to the top of polls in the Republican nomination race.  A Super PAC associated with Romney received $1 million from W Spann, a corporation that existed for four months and apparently engaged in no activity other than the donation. Edward Conard, a former executive of Romney’s old company, Bain Capital, came forward early this month and said he was behind W Spann, but said he did not intend to circumvent campaign finance law by creating the company.

And the reign of big money in politics inevitably will give too much clout to big donors, activists say.   “Those who fund the candidates are the ones who get listened to,” said Meredith McGehee, policy director at the Campaign Legal Center, which works on campaign finance and government ethics. “And a Super PAC and others that can deliver millions of dollars, any supposed notion that they are not going to have a leg up is wrong. It’s not just a leg up, it’s going to be that the system runs for them.”   All of the leading Republican candidates have Super PACs.   A half dozen are backing Perry, who has rocketed to the top of polls in the Republican nomination race.   A Super PAC associated with Romney received $1 million from W Spann, a corporation that existed for four months and apparently engaged in no activity other than the donation. Edward Conard, a former executive of Romney’s old company, Bain Capital, came forward early this month and said he was behind W Spann, but said he did not intend to circumvent campaign finance law by creating the company.

130,CMCSA,"Court battle looms between U.S. and AT&T;, T-Mobile","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department made a bold move when it sued to block AT&T Inc’s $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile. Now comes the hard part: going to court.  The government is asking a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to stop the deal, and will have to prove that it would mean higher prices and less competition.  “This will be the Obama administration’s line in the sand. This will be their signature antitrust event,” said University of Baltimore law school professor Robert Lande.  AT&T has said it will fight the case, and its general counsel said it plans to seek an expedited hearing from the judge. Even so, experts say, the company could decide that it is not worth the expense and uncertainty to go to trial.  An AT&T spokeswoman declined to comment.  Two big communications deals, MCI’s proposed takeover of Sprint in 1999 and EchoStar Communications Corp’s deal to buy Hughes Electronic Corp’s DirecTV in 2001 fell apart after the Justice Department challenged the deals.  “A preliminary question is whether AT&T will go to court. It’s certainly not uncommon for companies to look at this and decide that the game isn’t worth the gamble,” said David Smutny, an antitrust lawyer with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.  The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, who also oversaw the EchoStar-Hughes antitrust court challenge. Huvelle was appointed to the bench in 1999 by then President Bill Clinton.  In pre-trial proceedings in that case, Huvelle had harsh words for the way both companies responded to regulators’ information requests, calling them “sluggish.”  Any trial in the AT&T case would be lengthy and complicated, with experts predicting that both sides would put on a parade of witnesses including consumers, economists, and possibly competitors or state regulators.  In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that AT&T has overwhelming power in the national market — it is one of four major carriers — and that the market for mobile telecommunications would be highly concentrated in 96 of 100 U.S. cell phone market areas.  AT&T is likely to argue that the deal would create efficiencies in terms of price, quality and innovation — and maybe even jobs, said Lande, the Baltimore professor.  “Very few efficiency defenses work,” said Lande, who praised the Justice Department for bringing the action. “They make promises that these efficiencies could happen, but showing that in court is very difficult.”  While most antitrust attorneys declined to say how they thought the case would be decided, Howard University law professor Andy Gavil said he thought the judge would block the deal. “Having read the complaint, I don’t see a basis for a negotiated settlement,” said Gavil, who testified to Congress on the deal.  Two other veteran Washington antitrust attorneys, who declined to be identified because of potential conflicts involving their law firms and companies in the case, told Reuters they think the deal will be stopped, either because the court blocks it or because AT&T drops its bid.  If the case goes to trial, there may be no quick end. The losing side is likely to appeal.  “You could have a situation here where the combined litigation and regulatory process could extend for several months or years,” said Maury Mechanick, a telecommunications attorney at law firm White & Case.  “From a business practicality perspective, is that a delay that AT&T and T-Mobile can tolerate?” said Mechanick. “That’s ultimately a judgment that they will have to make.”  The case is USA v.

134,CMCSA,Relax football fans: Obama speech won't trump NFL,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American football fans can rest easy: President Barack Obama’s nationally televised jobs speech to Congress will not conflict with the season-opening NFL game between the Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints.  Obama agreed late on Wednesday to move his jobs address to a joint session of Congress back by a night from September 7 to September 8 to avoid overlapping with a debate by Republican presidential candidates on the first night.  But September 8 had its own problems: the season-opening National Football League matchup between the last two Super Bowl champions will air at 8:30 p.m. EDT on the NBC network that night.  Not to worry, the White House says. Obama’s address will be finished before the game begins.  “I can assure you that, for all you football fans, that he will be completed before kickoff,” White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday.  Carney noted that Obama, an avid sports fan himself, would also be able to tune in.  “It means that he’ll have the opportunity to watch the game like millions of other Americans,” he said.  John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, cited logistical and parliamentary impediments when asking Obama to move his address back by a day.  The two sides did not announce a time, however, once they agreed on the new date.  Late on Thursday, however, they agreed on 7:00 p.m. (2300 GMT), and both sides released short, polite statements, to say so.  “At his request, the Speaker has respectfully invited the President to address a Joint Session of Congress next Thursday at 7:00 p.m.,” Brendan Buck, a Boehner spokesman, said in a statement.  “After consulting with the Speaker’s office, the President has accepted an invitation to address a Joint Session of Congress at 7 p.m. on Thursday, September 8th,” Carney said in a statement shortly thereafter.  And that was the end of another chapter of political theater between Obama and congressional Republicans, at least until the debate over the contents of his speech starts in full next week.

135,CMCSA,U.S. judge signs off on Comcast NBC Universal buy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge, who had been critical of the Justice Department deal to allow Comcast Corp to buy NBC Universal, signed off on the transaction on Thursday, but added reporting requirements.  The department announced in January that Comcast could buy NBC Universal on the condition it cede control of the popular video website Hulu and make stand-alone broadband service available to customers at $49.95 per month for three years. But the settlement still required final approval from a judge.  In his final order, Judge Richard Leon said he would require Comcast and the department to collect data for at least two years on how many online video distributors, such as Hulu or Netflix Inc, demand arbitration because of a dispute with Comcast.  Online video emerged as a disruptive force for the cable industry as viewing habits changed and audiences increasingly found their favorite entertainment on the PC, tablet or smartphone.  A dispute arising last year threatened to disrupt the Comcast/NBCU deal as Level 3 Communications Inc, which helps Netflix stream videos to viewers, stepped up its attack on Comcast for demanding a fee to carry videos and other bandwidth-heavy Web traffic.  Regulators sought protection for online video by creating a streamlined and less costly arbitration process overseen by the Justice Department to allow online video distributors to get content from Comcast-NBCU when negotiations falter.  Leon expressed concern this process would not allow appeals.  “Since neither the Court nor the parties has a crystal ball to forecast how this Final Judgment, along with its arbitration mechanisms, will actually function ... I believe that certain additional steps are necessary,” Leon said in a court order.  Data collected would include how many online video distributors seek Justice Department permission to arbitrate through the new, streamlined system and the number that pursue Federal Communications Commission arbitration if their request is denied.  He also wanted data on how many online video distributors demand Federal Communications Commission arbitration, the outcome of these cases and the number of appeals.  The report is to be given to the court, which will then hold a yearly hearing before Judge Leon.  Comcast is the largest U.S. cable company and is also the top broadband provider.  Comcast completed the purchase of 51 percent of NBC Universal from General Electric Co in January. The deal created a $30 billion business that includes broadcast, cable networks, movie studios and theme parks.

141,CMCSA,Wall Street cash shifts to Romney from Obama," * Goldman Sachs, Obama 2008 donor, gives big to Romney   * Comcast employees big contributors to Obama   By Kim Dixon   WASHINGTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Wall Street money is heavily favoring Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the race to unseat President Barack Obama, the latest signal of business unease with Obama’s tenure and perhaps a bet on his re-election chances.   Romney, a co-founder of buyout firm Bain Capital, stresses his Wall Street acumen in his bid to win the Republican nomination to challenge Obama in the November 2012 election.   About a quarter of the $18 million Romney raised in the second quarter came from the financial sector, while 4.4 percent of the $48 million Obama’s campaign raised came from that group, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   Employees at the five biggest U.S. banks made the list of Romney’s top 20 donors, while just Goldman Sachs made it onto Obama’s contributor roll.   With 14 months before voters go to the polls, Obama’s handling of the fledgling economic recovery is at all-time lows with unemployment stubbornly stuck above 9 percent.   Wall Street money has been moving away from Obama and Democrats since 2010, in part fueled by Obama’s harsh criticism of banks and financial overhaul legislation he signed last year, which banks say is burdensome.   These latest figures confirm that trend.   The data also may suggest who Wall Street thinks has the best chance of becoming elected, said Willis Sparks, who analyzes elections for investors at Eurasia Group.   “Wall Street is in the business of picking winners,” he said. “There is some bet hedging going on right now about whether Obama can be re-elected.”   Those who work for Goldman Sachs (GS.N) were Romney’s biggest backers, giving about $293,000, while those with links to the investment behemoth gave Democrat Obama about $45,000, according to the analysis.   Companies themselves cannot give directly to candidates, but executives and political committees may do so.   In all of 2008, Goldman employees were Obama’s second biggest backer, giving him more than $1 million. The same group also was Romney’s biggest 2008 donors with about $235,000 in contributions.   Romney had led most Republican polls until Texas Governor Rick Perry jumped into the race last month. Perry is now leading Romney 24 percent to 17 percent, according to an average of polls by realclearpolitics.com.   To be sure, Obama is not wanting for campaign cash. He raised $86 million in the second quarter through his campaign  and the Democratic National Committee. Of that, his campaign brought in $48 million.   Romney’s numbers have dark spots too, said Jim Kessler, an analyst for Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank backed by Wall Street executives and other business interests.   About three-quarters of the funds Romney raised gave the maximum $2,500 donation and cannot give again until the general election, according to the Campaign Finance Institute.   Smaller donors are more passionate, willing to give again and likelier to translate to votes. Obama’s fundraising base is much broader with only 18 percent maxing out.   “I don’t see the fervency behind Romney,” Kessler said. “I have definitely heard some disillusionment with the president on Wall Street, but it is much less than it was a year ago.”   Romney is seen as more moderate than Perry and the other major Republican candidates.   A major question mark is Perry, who is also a prolific fundraiser, having won three races as Texas Governor. It remains to be seen as to whether he can raise big money nationally.   Employees of cable giant Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) were the biggest givers to Obama’s campaign. Comcast executive David Cohen is “bundling” funds for Obama.   Bundlers commit to raise big money, often between $50,000 and $500,000, for candidates. While not required by law, Obama released names of these heavy-hitters. None of the major Republican candidates has revealed those names.

142,CMCSA,Obama moves jobs speech to September 8,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Wednesday agreed to unveil new jobs proposals in an address to Congress on September 8, bowing to pressure from Republicans, who objected to the original date set for his high-profile speech.  Obama’s long-awaited proposals could set the agenda in Washington for the coming months, but his preferred date of September 7 had an unpalatable political edge for the opposition party: Republican presidential candidates were scheduled to hold a televised debate on the same evening, at the same time.  Thus began a new round of conflict between the Democratic president and Republicans in Congress.  The White House said the timing of the Republican debate and Obama’s proposed speech — announced in a letter to congressional leaders — was a coincidence.  But Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner asked Obama to come on Thursday instead of Wednesday, and the White House agreed.  “Both houses (of Congress) will be back in session after their August recess on Wednesday, September 7th, so that was the date that was requested,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement. “We consulted with the Speaker about that date before the letter was released, but he determined Thursday would work better.  The new date could have its own complications.  The season-opening NFL football game between Wisconsin’s Green Bay Packers and Louisiana’s New Orleans Saints will air at 8:30 p.m. EDT the same night on the NBC network, and many Americans would likely tune into that rather than watch an address by the president if they are at the same time.  The timing of the speech has yet to be determined.  “We appreciate the president working with us tonight and look forward to hearing his new proposals,” said Brendan Buck, a Boehner spokesman.  Obama said in his letter to congressional leaders he would use the address to lay out job-boosting proposals that members of both parties could support.  “As I have traveled across our country this summer and spoken with our fellow Americans, I have heard a consistent message: Washington needs to put aside politics and start making decisions based on what is best for our country and not what is best for each of our parties in order to grow the economy and create jobs,” Obama said in the letter.  “We must answer this call.”  The speaker’s office raised no objection to the time and date when the White House first proposed it on Wednesday morning, a White House official said. Buck said Boehner’s office never signed off on the original date.  The House and the Democratic-controlled Senate must pass a joint resolution to provide for Congress to assemble for Obama’s remarks. Lawmakers get back to work in Washington on September 7 after their summer recess and start votes at 6:30 p.m. EDT (2230 GMT). Boehner cited such parliamentary “impediments” when asking for the date change.  The back-and-forth led to criticism from both parties.  “People die and state funerals are held with less fuss, so the logistics excuse by the Speaker’s office is laughable,” said one senior Democratic aide.  Republicans saw it differently. Presidential candidate Michelle Bachmann suggested Obama’s original proposed timing aimed to distract Americans from watching her party’s debate.  “Now does this show maybe a little insecurity on the part of the president?” she said in Iowa.  By seeking a joint session of Congress, much like the president’s annual televised State of the Union address, Obama sought a sweeping platform in his opening bid to get support from Democrats and Republicans for his proposals.  But the original timing would have given Obama an opportunity to upstage the other party at the same time that he was seeking its support.  Obama said he would lay out a series of steps that Congress could act on immediately to strengthen small businesses and put “more money in the paychecks of the middle class and working Americans” while reducing the deficit.  Carney said Obama’s speech would focus primarily on jobs, with detailed proposals on deficit reduction coming later.  The proposals could include programs to fund infrastructure building, measures to help struggling homeowners, and tax breaks to encourage hiring of new workers.  Business lobby group the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it was skeptical about a payroll tax holiday to subsidize companies that hire workers.  “Companies don’t invest and hire people just because they have more cash,” said Martin Regalia, the group’s chief economist. “They hire people when they can put those people to work producing a product or a service that they can sell at a profit. That’s what they do. And right now the economy isn’t presenting that opportunity.”  ",9012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-obama-jobs-speech/obama-moves-jobs-speech-to-september-8-idUSTRE77U40T20110901
143,CMCSA,U.S. moves to block AT&T;'s purchase of T-Mobile,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday sued to block AT&T Inc’s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA, citing concerns it will harm competition in the wireless market and lead to higher prices.  The surprise move, which was the biggest antitrust challenge yet by the Obama administration, caught the carriers by surprise and if successful would end AT&T’s move to unseat Verizon Wireless as the No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier.  If AT&T fails to defeat the Justice Department lawsuit, it will prove very costly — the No. 2 carrier would have to pay T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom an estimated $6 billion in cash and other assets as part of the original deal.  The announcement is a slap in the face for AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, who was poised for a career-defining deal that would allow him to emerge from the shadow of predecessor and serial acquirer Ed Whitacre.  The court case could take months and cost millions of dollars. Wall Street immediately signaled the deal was likely now a longshot, with shares in the companies falling sharply.  Justice Department officials warned that allowing AT&T to gobble up the No. 4 carrier would be disastrous for consumers.  “Were the merger to proceed, there would only be three providers with 90 percent of the market, and competition among the remaining competitors on all dimensions, including price, quality and innovation, would be diminished,” Deputy Attorney General James Cole told reporters.  The lawsuit came only five months after the deal was announced and despite the surprising timing, one source close to the case said it was a real attempt to halt a “fundamentally flawed” deal, not a tactic to wring big concessions from AT&T.  They would have to give up “so much” to win approval, the source said. Still, Justice Department officials said they were willing to consider proposals to ameliorate their concerns, but they expected to the fight to shift to federal court.  A source close to one of the carriers said they may have to offer to divest up to 25 percent of the combined company’s assets, up from an earlier estimate of up to 10 percent, to try to save the deal.  James Ratcliffe, an analyst at Barclays Capital slashed his expectations that the deal would win approval to a range of 35 percent to 40 percent, down from 75 percent.  The government’s lawsuit overshadowed an announcement just hours earlier by AT&T that it would bring back 5,000 call center jobs to the United States if the deal closed.  Just a day ago, the two sides had met to continue discussions on the merger and the Justice Department dropped no hints that it was getting frustrated with the talks.  The two sides were “talking past each other,” said one source familiar with the case, adding that the Justice Department side felt that nothing was really presented to address their competition concerns.  AT&T’s Stephenson has argued that his company needs T-Mobile to get more wireless airwaves to meet exploding demand for high-speed mobile services from smartphones and tablets.  Stephenson put himself on the line with this deal so he has no choice but to double down, said a person close to AT&T. [ID:nN1E77U26Q]  Shares of AT&T closed down 3.8 percent at $28.48 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Deutsche Telekom shares fell 7.6 percent to 8.81 euros in Frankfurt trade.  “This one took everybody by surprise,” said a person close to one of the carriers, adding that they thought the Justice Department would ask for concessions but not derail the deal.  Meanwhile shares of Sprint Nextel Corp — the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier, which has fiercely opposed the deal — shot up almost 6 percent to close at $3.76. A scuppered acquisition could prompt Sprint to consider buying T-Mobile.  AT&T’s high-powered lobbying team in Washington is led by Jim Cicconi, who previously worked in the Reagan and Bush administrations.  “We thought the weight of AT&T’s lobbying was having some success; this very much undermines that. It’s very uncertain where this leaves us at the moment,” said Andrew Hogley, telecom analyst at Espirito Santo investment bank.  If the government succeeds in blocking the deal, it would also be a major setback for Deutsche Telekom, which for years has been looking for a way out of T-Mobile USA, a business that has ceased to be a source of growth.  Deutsche Telekom “will gain some short-term consolation from the penalties it can exact from AT&T,” said John Delaney, an analyst at technology research firm IDC. “But in the end, DT would still be stuck with the problem of how to turn around a sub-scale national operator with a declining subscriber base.”  The news also sent chills through the mergers and acquisitions market. Not only do the seven investment banks that advised on this deal stand to lose about $150 million in fees, but bankers elsewhere were also worried it could make companies think twice about antitrust risk when mulling takeovers.  Antitrust experts saw this case as the signature antitrust event for the Obama administration, which includes former AT&T executive William Daley serving as White House chief of staff.  “This is an administration that came in saying it was going to have a more aggressive approach,” said Michael Sohn, an antitrust attorney with Davis Polk Wardwell LLP.  The administration has cleared some big deals like Comcast Corp’s purchase of NBC Universal, but Nasdaq OMX Group Inc and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew a hostile bid for NYSE Euronext after opposition from antitrust regulators.  “I think the court is going to block it,” said Andy Gavil, who teaches law at Howard University in Washington and testified to Congress on the deal. “Having read the complaint, I don’t see a basis for a negotiated settlement.”  One thing most experts agree on is that it would take a long time for the case to wind its way through the courts. The question remains whether the companies are willing to pursue that route and for how long, or go their separate ways.  Another complicating factor is that the deal also needs approve by the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates wireless communications.  “Although our process is not complete, the record before this agency also raises serious concerns about the impact of the proposed transaction on competition,” said FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski.  The case is USA v. AT&T Inc et al, No. 11-cv-1560 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

144,CMCSA,Relax football fans: Obama speech won't trump NFL,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American football fans can rest easy: President Barack Obama’s nationally televised jobs speech to Congress will not conflict with the season-opening NFL game between the Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints.  Obama agreed late on Wednesday to move his jobs address to a joint session of Congress back by a night from September 7 to September 8 to avoid overlapping with a debate by Republican presidential candidates on the first night.  But September 8 had its own problems: the season-opening National Football League matchup between the last two Super Bowl champions will air at 8:30 p.m. EDT on the NBC network that night.  Not to worry, the White House says. Obama’s address will be finished before the game begins.  “I can assure you that, for all you football fans, that he will be completed before kickoff,” White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday.  Carney noted that Obama, an avid sports fan himself, would also be able to tune in.  “It means that he’ll have the opportunity to watch the game like millions of other Americans,” he said.  John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, cited logistical and parliamentary impediments when asking Obama to move his address back by a day.  The two sides did not announce a time, however, once they agreed on the new date.  Late on Thursday, however, they agreed on 7:00 p.m. (2300 GMT), and both sides released short, polite statements, to say so.  “At his request, the Speaker has respectfully invited the President to address a Joint Session of Congress next Thursday at 7:00 p.m.,” Brendan Buck, a Boehner spokesman, said in a statement.  “After consulting with the Speaker’s office, the President has accepted an invitation to address a Joint Session of Congress at 7 p.m. on Thursday, September 8th,” Carney said in a statement shortly thereafter.  And that was the end of another chapter of political theater between Obama and congressional Republicans, at least until the debate over the contents of his speech starts in full next week.

145,CMCSA,"Court battle looms between U.S. and AT&T;, T-Mobile","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department made a bold move when it sued to block AT&T Inc’s $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile. Now comes the hard part: going to court.  The government is asking a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to stop the deal, and will have to prove that it would mean higher prices and less competition.  “This will be the Obama administration’s line in the sand. This will be their signature antitrust event,” said University of Baltimore law school professor Robert Lande.  AT&T has said it will fight the case, and its general counsel said it plans to seek an expedited hearing from the judge. Even so, experts say, the company could decide that it is not worth the expense and uncertainty to go to trial.  An AT&T spokeswoman declined to comment.  Two big communications deals, MCI’s proposed takeover of Sprint in 1999 and EchoStar Communications Corp’s deal to buy Hughes Electronic Corp’s DirecTV in 2001 fell apart after the Justice Department challenged the deals.  “A preliminary question is whether AT&T will go to court. It’s certainly not uncommon for companies to look at this and decide that the game isn’t worth the gamble,” said David Smutny, an antitrust lawyer with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.  The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, who also oversaw the EchoStar-Hughes antitrust court challenge. Huvelle was appointed to the bench in 1999 by then President Bill Clinton.  In pre-trial proceedings in that case, Huvelle had harsh words for the way both companies responded to regulators’ information requests, calling them “sluggish.”  Any trial in the AT&T case would be lengthy and complicated, with experts predicting that both sides would put on a parade of witnesses including consumers, economists, and possibly competitors or state regulators.  In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that AT&T has overwhelming power in the national market — it is one of four major carriers — and that the market for mobile telecommunications would be highly concentrated in 96 of 100 U.S. cell phone market areas.  AT&T is likely to argue that the deal would create efficiencies in terms of price, quality and innovation — and maybe even jobs, said Lande, the Baltimore professor.  “Very few efficiency defenses work,” said Lande, who praised the Justice Department for bringing the action. “They make promises that these efficiencies could happen, but showing that in court is very difficult.”  While most antitrust attorneys declined to say how they thought the case would be decided, Howard University law professor Andy Gavil said he thought the judge would block the deal. “Having read the complaint, I don’t see a basis for a negotiated settlement,” said Gavil, who testified to Congress on the deal.  Two other veteran Washington antitrust attorneys, who declined to be identified because of potential conflicts involving their law firms and companies in the case, told Reuters they think the deal will be stopped, either because the court blocks it or because AT&T drops its bid.  If the case goes to trial, there may be no quick end. The losing side is likely to appeal.  “You could have a situation here where the combined litigation and regulatory process could extend for several months or years,” said Maury Mechanick, a telecommunications attorney at law firm White & Case.  “From a business practicality perspective, is that a delay that AT&T and T-Mobile can tolerate?” said Mechanick. “That’s ultimately a judgment that they will have to make.”  The case is USA v. AT&T Inc et al, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 11-cv-1560.  For the DOJ: Sharis Pozen, Joseph Wayland, Gene Kimmelman, Patricia Brink, Laury Bobbish, Claude Scott and Lawrence Frankel.  For Defendants: Not immediately available.

148,CMCSA,"UPDATE 1-'The Help' wins box office, summer hits record"," * ‘The Help’ holds top spot with $19 million   * ‘The Debt’ takes second place   * Summer sales break Hollywood record  (Adds details on top five films, summer sales totals)   By Lisa Richwine   LOS ANGELES, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The maids of “The Help” didn’t take the Labor Day weekend off. The surprise summer hit held firm at the top of the domestic box office for the third straight week with $19 million in ticket sales.   The drama about white women and their black maids in Civil Rights-era Mississippi polished off three new films based on four-day estimates released by movie studios on Monday, the U.S. Labor Day holiday that ended a record summer at U.S. and Canadian theaters. “The Help,” a critics favorite that debuted a month ago in the No. 2 spot, was produced by DreamWorks and distributed by Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).   Newcomers including two horror flicks generated modest sales on a weekend traditionally slow for movie-going.   Spy thriller “The Debt,” starring Helen Mirren, took second place with a better-than-expected $12.6 million in the North American (U.S. and Canadian) market. The film tells the story of the hunt for a Nazi war criminal and how the mission haunts a trio of secret agents three decades later. The film drew an older audience with 70 percent of moviegoers over age 40, distributor Focus Features said.   The studio released the movie on Wednesday, and estimated domestic sales since it debuted reached $14.5 million.   Space mystery “Apollo 18,” a new release that purports to use “found footage” of an ill-fated trip to the moon, came in third for the weekend with $10.7 million. That fell within studio projections for a film that cost less than $5 million to make, said Erik Lomis, president of distribution for The Weinstein Co, which released the film.   Following behind at No. 4 was new thriller “Shark Night (3-D),” a tale of nightmarish fresh-water shark attacks at a Louisiana lake house, with $10.3 million, at the higher end of industry expectations. Aimed at teens, the film drew 57 percent of its audience from an under-25 crowd.   Sci-fi flick “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” stayed strong, rounding out the top five with $10.3 million during its fifth weekend in theaters.   “Apes,” a revival of the classic tale of chimps launching a revolution, and “The Help” stood out as two surprise summer hits. “Apes” has rung up $162.5 million in domestic sales and $186.5 million in international markets, for a combined total of $349 million.   “The Help” has pulled in about $123.4 million since it hit U.S. and Canadian theaters, exceeding forecasts from box-office watchers. The film is an adaptation of a best-selling novel by Kathryn Stockett.   The two movies helped Hollywood rack up record sales for the four-month summer season measured from early May through Labor Day, when studios bring in as much as 40 percent of annual revenue. Domestic totals hit an estimated $4.4 billion for the period, a 0.7 percent increase from last year, according to figures from Hollywood.com Box Office.   The revenue gain was helped by slightly higher average ticket prices as movie attendance fell 1.4 percent.   “Though attendance figures are down, the performance is still impressive given the intense competition” for audiences posed by a range of entertainment options, said Paul Dergarabedian, head of Hollywood.com Box Office.   Summer hits included big sequels such as “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2” and “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” plus superhero tales such as “Captain America: The First Avenger” and family film “The Smurfs.” Adult comedies, including “Bridesmaids” and “The Hangover 2” also scored with audiences.   “The Debt” was released by Focus Features, a unit of Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) Universal Pictures. Privately held Weinstein Co released “Apollo 18.” Closely held Relativity Media released “Shark Night (3-D)” in the United States and eOne distributed the film in Canada.   “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” was released by 20th Century Fox, the film studio of News Corp (NWSA.O).

152,CMCSA,NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell has breast cancer,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Andrea Mitchell, NBC’s chief foreign affairs correspondent and wife of former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, said on her TV program on Wednesday that she has breast cancer.  “I had planned to be hiking in Wyoming last week, but instead discovered that I am now among the one in eight women in this country — incredibly, one in eight — who have had breast cancer,” she announced at the end of “Andrea Mitchell Reports” on MSNBC.

156,CMCSA,Analysis: Plenty of backstage drama in TV season,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - This fall’s TV schedule will be full of twenty-somethings looking for love, singers searching out fame and dinosaurs hunting down dinner — and if that’s not enough, there promises to be a heap of drama behind the scenes.  What unfolds at NBC and ABC will be among the most closely watched developments of the 2011-12 season. Both have relatively new entertainment chiefs in Bob Greenblatt and Paul Lee, who made major changes to their prime-time schedules in hopes of resurrecting ratings and satisfying management at Comcast Corp and Walt Disney Co.  Fox and CBS, with stronger schedules, will be under less scrutiny, but all four broadcast networks could feel the heat from advertisers who signed pricey deals for commercial time. Last spring, during the dealmaking period, commercial rates rose around 10 percent from a year earlier.  The trouble is that concerns over the economy have intensified since advertisers made those deals — today there is far more talk about a double-dip recession — and they could be taking a hard look at spending plans.  Along Madison Avenue, anticipation is running high for “The X Factor,” a new musical competition from Simon Cowell that Fox hopes will be a blockbuster along the lines of “American Idol.” Advertisers paid up to $400,000 for 30-second spots and it boasts a clutch of blue-chip corporate sponsors, including Pepsi and Chevrolet.  Other shows that are generating buzz — for better or worse — include ABC’s “Pan Am” and “Charlie’s Angels,” NBC’s “The Playboy Club,” “Smash” and “Prime Suspect,” and Fox’s “Terra Nova,” a costly Steven Spielberg-produced dinosaur drama burdened with high expectations.  Last year, more than three-quarters of the new shows were canceled and several barely lasted a month, the most notable being “Lonestar,” a high profile con-man drama that Fox abandoned after two episodes.  “Look, all these guys are under pressure,” said Brad Adgate, senior vice president of research at advertising firm Horizon Media. “You get next day ratings and must immediately make million dollar decisions. Every day there is a hero and every day there is a goat. But there’s probably more pressure on ABC than anybody.”  Now president of ABC Entertainment, Lee spent 7 years running ABC Family until he was promoted in July 2010. This is his second full TV season running ABC, but the first one in which he’s been involved from development through scheduling.  Lee can bank on the popular comedy “Modern Family” and “Grey’s Anatomy” is still a top rated drama, but this will be the last season of the long-running “Desperate Housewives” and there are already some major holes in the lineup.  “His problem is that there aren’t a lot of building blocks there,” said David Scardino, entertainment specialist at media agency RPA. “I don’t know how much patience Disney is going to have with him.”  NBC’s Greenblatt, meanwhile, should have some breathing room. Comcast hired him away from Showtime, where he had a solid track record, and has indicated it does not expect to revive NBC’s fortunes in one season. For 2011-12, Greenblatt will bring out a hefty 12 new shows, including “Smash,” a midseason musical set on Broadway that will star Katherine McPhee from “American Idol.”  “Comcast is at least paying lip service to the fact that this won’t be turned around overnight,” Scardino said.  The biggest surprise of the TV season may be if either ABC or NBC manage to move up in the ratings. That would mean beating out either News Corp’s Fox, with several blockbuster hits, or CBS Corp’s CBS, with the strongest top-to-bottom schedule in the business.  Another shocker would be if the four broadcast networks can arrest the steady decline in their collective audience.  One reason for the drop in viewership at the broadcast networks is the increasing competition from cable TV, with its critical and popular hits such as “Mad Men,” “Breaking Bad,” and “Justified.” Advertisers are well aware of the trend and swallowed huge price increases from the cable networks during the spring negotiations.  It remains to be seen whether advertisers will start to back away from pricey deals in general, exercising options that allow them to cancel.  “There is always a lag between what the economy is doing currently and where the budgets are — since budgets are done early,” said Scardino. “If I was on the network side, I would be nervous.”  ",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-drama/analysis-plenty-of-backstage-drama-in-tv-season-idUSTRE7886K420110909
157,CMCSA,Morgan Stanley names co-heads of Media & Comms," NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has appointed three senior media and telecom bankers to serve as global co-heads of its Media & Communications Group, succeeding Stuart Epstein.   Epstein, who had been with Morgan Stanley since 1984, is leaving to become CFO of Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBCUniversal. He will report to NBCU CEO Steve Burke and take up his new post in mid-October.   Morgan Stanley on Thursday named Jean Abergel, Max Herrnstein and Adam Shepard as global co-heads of the Media & Communications Group.   Abergel, who has been with the bank for 12 years, is currently head of Media & Communications in Europe and has been instrumental in a number of deals, including Skype’s $2.6 billion sale to eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and the proposed $39 billion sale of T-Mobile USA to AT&T Inc (T.N).    Herrnstein has been with Morgan Stanley for 13 years and is currently head of Media in North America. He has also been integral to major transactions, including Nielsen’s $2.18 billion initial public offering this year and the $42.1 billion spin-off of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N from Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) in 2009.   Shepard joined Morgan Stanley 11 years ago and is currently Head of Telecom in North America. He spearheaded Qwest’s CTQ.N $23 billion merger with CenturyLink (CTL.N) and also advised Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE) on its sale of T-Mobile USA to AT&T.

158,CMCSA,"""Contagion"" catches box office lead","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “Contagion” gripped filmgoers as the thriller about the race to contain a deadly virus took hold of the top spot at the domestic box office and knocked hit drama “The Help” to second place.  “Contagion” brought in an estimated $23.1 million at U.S. and Canadian theaters over its first three days, distributor Warner Bros. said on Sunday. Six international markets added another $2.1 million.  Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film tells the story of a fast-spreading killer virus and scientists’ efforts to stop it as the body count rises. The movie features an all-star cast that includes Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne and Jude Law.  The film beat studio expectations by telling “a tough story in a provocative way. There is nothing more icky than this,” said Jeff Goldstein, executive vice president of domestic distribution for Warner Bros.  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the movie a B- rating on average.  “The Help,” a critics and audience favorite about black maids who speak out about white employers in civil rights-era Mississippi, slipped to second place after three straight weeks as the box-office leader. The film soaked up $8.7 million, pushing up its domestic receipts to $137.1 million since the book adaptation hit theaters five weeks ago.  “Warrior,” a new drama about two brothers who battle for victory and redemption in a mixed-martial arts tournament, finished third with a disappointing $5.6 million. The brothers, a war veteran played by Tom Hardy and a high-school teacher and father played by Joel Edgerton, face wounds from the past as their estranged father, portrayed Nick Nolte, works as one of their coaches.  The film earned an A from audiences polled by CinemaScore and positive reviews from critics.  “We’re going to continue to fight. The film is an underdog story and this is an underdog movie,” said David Spitz, head of domestic distribution for Lionsgate, the studio that released the film.  The No. 4 movie domestically was spy thriller “The Debt” with $4.9 million over its second weekend. Action movie “Colombiana,” starring Zoe Saldana as an assassin seeking revenge, landed fifth with $4.0 million.  Comedy “Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star” was a box-office bomb. Panned by critics, the film about a Midwestern kid who moves to Hollywood to become a porn star brought in $1.5 million in North American receipts and failed to crack the weekend’s top 10. “While the movie was made on a very modest budget, it didn’t work out the way we hoped,” Sony spokesman Steve Elzer said.

162,CMCSA,FCC's Internet rules clear a review hurdle,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Controversial new Internet rules adopted late last year by the Federal Communications Commission will soon be published officially, a step expected to trigger legal challenges.  The White House’s Office of Management and Budget signed off on the rules on Friday, according to a notice on the OMB’s website, clearing way for publication in the Federal Register, a process which generally takes one to three weeks.  The rules, which try to balance fair treatment of competing content with the need for internet providers to manage their networks, will go into effect 60 days after publication.  Verizon Communications Inc and MetroPCS Communications Inc had accused the FCC of overstepping its authority in a challenge shortly after the FCC’s 3-2 vote.  But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in April said the challenges were premature, coming prior to publication in the Federal Register.  The same court ruled last year that the FCC lacked the authority to stop Comcast Corp from blocking bandwidth-hogging applications on its broadband network. A decision leading to the FCC’s latest rules.  Criticized by opponents as a legally shaky government intrusion into regulating the Internet, the new rules would prevent network operators from blocking lawful content but still let them ration access to their networks.  The debate surrounding the Internet rules has highlighted a huge divide between those who say the Internet should flourish without regulation and those who say the power of high-speed Internet providers to discriminate against competitors needs to be restrained.  The delay between the FCC’s vote and official publication has been unusually  long.  Some industry sources and former regulators have accused the FCC of intentional foot-dragging to stall court challenges.

165,CMCSA,Few sure winners seen at the Emmy Awards,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - If there are any sure bets at this year’s Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, they are “Modern Family” again being crowned TV’s best comedy series and Kate Winslet winning for her role in “Mildred Pierce”.  Most everything else is up for grabs at the TV industry’s highest honors in what awards watchers call one of the closest Emmys in years.  “There are a lot of predictions, but no sure bets and that’s why the Emmys is packing some excitement this year,” said Todd Gold, managing editor of Xfinity TV. “It is full of outstanding shows from networks to cable, and premium cable.”  Even critical darling “Mad Men” cannot rest on its laurels as a three-time best drama winner, despite its 19 nominations.  But the stylish 1960s advertising drama faces a threat from HBO’s new prohibition era series “Boardwalk Empire”, which not only won Golden Globe and Screen Actor’s Guild prizes earlier this year but walked off with seven trophies last weekend at the creative arts portion of Emmy Awards.  “It looked as if ‘Mad Men’ was going into this year’s Emmys as the inevitable winner. But all of a sudden, we have a real race here,” said Tom O’Neil of awards websites TheEnvelope.com and Goldderby.com.  And don’t count out HBO’s fantasy series “Game of Thrones”, based on the best-selling novels by George R.R. Martin.  “Game of Thrones” may skew too young for the older, more traditional members of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, who make up the bulk of Emmy voters. But Gold called it “by far the most exciting series of the past season. It was big and bold. It broke barriers and extended the boundaries of what a dramatic TV series can be. It was like a big movie every week.”  Five of the 2011 drama and comedy series contenders are first time nominees, while the acting categories feature a slew of Emmy rookies including hot pick Timothy Olyphant (“Justified”), Martha Plimpton (“Raising Hope”) and possible upset winner Melissa McCarthy (“Mike & Molly”).  But old timers like departing “The Office” star Steve Carell — a five-time loser — and Ed O’Neill of “Modern Family” stand good chances of finally winning an Emmy.  “Will Carell get a parting gift as he leaves ‘The Office’? He might get a goodbye hug,” said O’Neil. As for the “Modern Family” actor who was snubbed at the Emmys in 2010, “There is a perception in Hollywood that Ed is overdue,” O’Neil said.  Competition in the best actor drama slot is also fierce in the absence of triple winner Bryan Cranston of “Breaking Bad””  The “Mad Men” of the 1960s advertising drama have never won an acting Emmy. But after a strong fourth season, Jon Hamm’s conflicted Don Draper was seen as leading the pack this year for best actor in a drama.  Until, that is, Steve Buscemi’s corrupt politician in “Boardwalk Empire” muscled in. “Buscemi is an actors’ actor. They just love him. He is a star of indie films and just the kind of thespian that Emmy voters like,” said O’Neil.  While cable TV shows dominate the drama series nominees, network television has the lock on comedy this year.  A repeat win for ABC mockumentary “Modern Family”, with 17 nominations, is a near certainty, although Gold described NBC’s “Parks and Recreation” as the choice of hipsters.  “‘Modern Family’ is perhaps the first mainstream comedy about a family for years that has the opportunity to be a long-running classic,” said Gold.  Last year’s pop culture phenomenon “Glee,” on the other hand, “had a soft second season. It was full of guest stars and stunts and it didn’t consistently deliver in the way fans expected,” Gold said.  However Jane Lynch, who also hosts the live Emmy ceremony on Fox television in Los Angeles on Sunday, looks sure to take home a second trophy for her supporting actress turn as sarcastic cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester in “Glee.”  As for Winslet, she is seen as a shoo-in for best miniseries actress for her role in HBO’s much admired “Mildred Pierce”, which leads all Emmy nominations with 21 nods.

167,CMCSA,HOW TO PLAY IT - Did Netflix's very bad day create value?," THE ISSUE: Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), one of the most closely-watched “momentum” stocks”, dropped nearly 20 percent on Thursday. Is it time to buy ‘bargain’ shares in the fast-expanding web video service?   By Sam Forgione   NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - High-flying Netflix’s lowered estimate for subscriber growth Thursday sent its shares sharply lower as investors got a disappointing first look at how customers were handling a price increases launched this month.   When the new pricing structure was disclosed some worried it might threaten the fast-growth of the company that has become synonymous with the mail-order DVD and online movies. Netflix (NFLX.O) shares have been pressured since the new fees were made public.   The stock has been long wired for growth and any disappointment hits hard. Netflix was the top percentage gainer among S&P 500 components in 2010, surging 226.4 percent.   Here are two views on how to play the stock from here:   Beyond mere pricing, subscriptions could be threatened by a content battle, says Tony Wible, media and entertainment analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. In his view, Netflix’s lack of access to exclusive content and inability to negotiate a deal with Liberty Media’s Starz will hurt profits.  The fear surrounding cable channel operator Starz shutting out Netflix is that the dvd rental company will no longer have exclusive content when its Viacom deal expires in February.   It faces growing competition from well-heeled players that have both content and access into customers’ homes. “Netflix is sandwiched between cable operators with content and pipes, like Comcast (CMCSA.OQ), and companies like Google (GOOG.O), Apple (AAPL.O), and Amazon (AMZN.O), which have bigger balance sheets,” Wible said.   Google’s purchase of Motorola Mobility and Apple TV can bring big advantages to the table. Netflix, meanwhile, could be burdened in $3 billion of contract obligations.   “If you own shares, sell them. Stay away and don’t fall into the momentum trap and catch a falling knife” Wible said.   The other view is that Netflix may now be a bargain, since much of what is happening has already been anticipated by the company, says Michael Olson and Andrew Murphy of Piper Jaffray, who have an “overweight” rating with a price target of $305 per share on Netflix,   “The silver lining is that the primary miss is in DVD subs, while streaming and DVD+streaming subs are essentially in line,” the analysts said in a research note.   The analysts say the lower growth is to be expected, and that the declines reflect changes now that will result in higher growth going forward.   “We continue to believe Netflix raised prices on its DVD plans in order to push the sub(scriber) base further toward streaming (instant online video.)”   The streaming business has more potential for profit growth than legacy DVD, which Netflix has been trying to de-emphasize. And it was relatively unscathed.   “In other words, the company missed its Q3 sub target primarily on DVD subscribers (by 800k) and missed only slightly in the streaming category (by 200k).”    ",9152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/netflix-howtoplayit/how-to-play-it-did-netflixs-very-bad-day-create-value-idUSS1E78E1FY20110915

169,CMCSA,"Hollywood rolls out red carpet for Cowell's ""X Factor""","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - There aren’t many reality TV shows that stage their own world premiere.  But this is Simon Cowell and his much-hyped new singing contest “The X Factor”, which rolled out the red carpet in Hollywood on Wednesday night ahead of his return to U.S. television next week.  A year after walking away from his job as a judge on “American Idol” — the most watched show on U.S. TV — the brash Briton has lost none of his self-confidence. His new venture, in which he is both creator and executive producer as well as a judge, is promoted with the simple tagline “He’s Back.”  “I am feeling excited now. There is always nerves before a launch but it is good nerves...I have always wanted to have, not a film premiere, but a TV premiere in the cinema. I think it is brilliant”, Cowell said of Wednesday’s splashy event at one of Hollywood’s top cinemas.  Americans get their first look at “The X Factor” on September 21. But a pumped-up audience of hundreds of Twitter fans and competition winners from across the United States, were invited to the premiere to see just what the fuss was all about.  “I’ve never been to a premiere of a TV show where this many people came out,” said Mike Darnell, head of reality TV programing at Fox, as Cowell and his fellow judges entered the movie theater to the booming soundtrack of “Live and Let Die.”  “X Factor,” already a huge hit in the U.K. offers an unprecedented $5 million prize for the winner. Judges compete with each other as mentors to singers and to groups of performers aged 12 and up who audition in arenas packed with thousands of people.  The show brings Cowell’s cutting sarcasm back to primetime television and reunites him with his old “American Idol” sparring partner, the erratic but endearing Paula Abdul. Former Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Scherzinger and record producer Antonio “L.A, “ Reid complete the judging panel.  “Paula can be a bit wacky at times, but Nicole isn’t far behind,” Cowell quipped, going on to describe working with Abdul as “like getting an old dog back from the rescue pound. It’s kind of grateful to see you, and the relationship is back intact.”  Cowell has set the bar high for the “X Factor”, calling it a “game-changer” for TV that he says will thrash the competition and beat “American Idol” — also on Fox — as the most popular show in America.  Fox and advertisers are also looking for results. Advertisers have spent up to $400,000 for a 30 second spot, and Fox hopes that it will help reverse the network’s traditionally patchy showing in the fall TV ratings.  According to Cowell, Fox was nervous about taking the leap. “The network would initially have been happier if we had all stayed on ‘Idol’ for the rest of our lives and there wouldn’t be another show,” he said ahead of the premiere.  But Cowell said Fox later accepted that, given the show’s success in the UK, a competitor might come along. “They didn’t have to be dragged kicking and screaming to it in the end. But these are expensive shows to produce,” he said.  Getting the show off the ground in the U.S. hasn’t been without challenges. Cowell made a rare misstep earlier this year when he chose British singer Cheryl Cole — unknown in the United States — as a judge and then swiftly removed her when she underperformed in early tapings.  In the version Americans will see next week, Cole is on the first show, but not on the second — a change introduced merely with the line “a new city, and a new judge”.  “Lots of things went wrong along the way,” Cowell said of the Cole saga. “Bad things happen when you make reality shows, but you’ve just got to deal with it.”  ",9152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-xfactor/hollywood-rolls-out-red-carpet-for-cowells-x-factor-idUSTRE78E52020110915

172,CMCSA,Hulu sale at risk even as new bids are due,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The auction of online video site Hulu has been slowed by recent developments which could derail it completely, according to sources familiar with the process.  Among the issues are conflicts over complicated digital rights, a wide bid-ask gap, and Yahoo being sidelined as a potential buyer by its own issues. Moreover, NBC Universal’s hiring of Morgan Stanley banker Stuart Epstein, who was involved in the sale process for the bank, as its chief financial officer complicates a potential deal.  And then there is the lack of commitment to sell by Hulu’s owners — News Corp, Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and Providence Equity Partners.  News Corp Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey even acknowledged during the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month that a Hulu sale might not happen.  A new round of bids are due next week and price will be in a key issue in whether the auction moves forward, according to a source close to the situation.  Other sources with knowledge of the talks said an unusually wide gap has developed in recent weeks between the price bidders are offering and what the Hulu owners are willing to accept. Hulu’s owners are becoming more steadfast about the price and feel enough strategic alternatives are available to reject low-ball offers, sources said.  Bids have ranged from as low as $500 million to as much as $2 billion. The most serious suitors include Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc, DirecTV Group Inc and DISH Network Corp.  Yahoo Inc had been viewed as one of the most enthusiastic likely bidders, but that was before its leadership imploded last week with the firing of CEO Carol Bartz. The company is likely to be too preoccupied with its own issues to digest a multibillion dollar deal. Moreover, Hulu’s owners would be reluctant to sell to a company undergoing an internal upheaval.  As with any sale, the situation is fluid and there remains a chance Google or another party could swoop in with a rich offer. Reports have suggested Google was planning an offer, but company insiders are uncertain Hulu’s media owners would sanction a sale to the search engine giant — at least not without caveats such as blocking piracy searches, for example.  After intense initial interest due to Hulu’s huge and growing popularity, the sale has stalled as bidders questioned what they would get for their money.  One senior media executive said the nature of Hulu’s content deals is key to whether a deal happens or not.  “I guess the brand and technology are worth something, but probably not for that asking price because digital companies could develop a site on their own,” the executive said, who asked not to be identified speaking about a partner company.  CBS Corp boss Les Moonves openly questioned Hulu’s value during an interview at a Paley Media Center event on Thursday.  “What are they getting and how long are they getting it?” asked Moonves, whose company is not a Hulu owner or content provider. “Are they buying two years of programs for $2 billion? I don’t know. I shouldn’t say more, I’ll get in trouble.”  The issue of rights, particularly on newer platforms such as the Web and mobile, are both unclear and complicated, adding to the potential deal’s complexity.  BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said a recent decision by NBC Universal to offer programs for free via an iPhone and iPad app without requiring a cable subscription effectively undermines the value of the rights Hulu’s owners are trying to sell. The move also potentially conflicts with News Corp unit Fox TV’s strategy of allowing Hulu users to access only the latest TV shows if they are a pay-TV subscriber.  “It gets more challenging to push through the Hulu sale, given what NBC just did,” said Greenfield.  Comcast agreed, as part of the regulatory restrictions attached to its takeover of NBCU, that NBCU would abstain from key management decisions at Hulu.  If the sale falls apart, it will mark the second time its owners have fashioned a full or partial exit strategy that has failed. After nearly six months of planning, the owners ditched an initial public offering last December to raise up to $300 million. Such an IPO would have valued the company at about $2 billion.  But the decision to ditch the IPO in favor of a sale prompted industry observers to wonder whether media companies should risk handing over their future online to digital rivals such as Google and Amazon. Greenfield has described the plan to sell Hulu as a mistake of “epic proportions.”  “Hulu appears to be the perfect weapon for networks and content creators to embrace so they can grow revenues and profits, even if the current multichannel ecosystem becomes unglued over the next decade,” said Greenfield in his client-targeted blog.

174,CMCSA,"""Mad Men"" tries to fend off ""Boardwalk"" at Emmys","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Television’s “Mad Men” went to the Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, hoping to fend off the Prohibition-era gangsters of “Boardwalk Empire” and win a fourth straight victory at the industry’s top honors.  “Glee” star Chris Colfer, Christina Hendricks of “Mad Men” and Joel McHale of “Community” were among early arrivals on a red carpet packed with diamond jewelry and glorious gowns in shades of coral and pink.  More than 20 Emmys will be handed out in the live telecast on the Fox network hosted by “Glee” star Jane Lynch, who could find herself accepting an early award for her supporting actress role as a sarcastic cheerleading coach on the hit musical comedy.  But all eyes will be on the top prizes — for best comedy and drama series to be handed out at the end of the three-hour ceremony — and some major upsets could be in store, especially in the acting categories.  ABC mockumentary and 2010 Emmy comedy series winner “Modern Family” goes into Sunday’s awards with 17 nominations, including acting mentions for all six of its stars.  That puts it in a commanding position for a repeat victory over rivals “Glee,” “The Office,” “Parks and Recreation” and “The Big Bang Theory.”  The contest for best drama is much closer. HBO’s lavish new show “Boardwalk Empire,” with 18 nominations, has already taken Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild trophies and is regarded as a major contender, despite the 19 nods to “Mad Men,” the 1960s advertising drama on AMC.  Medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones,” which proved a surprise success for HBO, has an army of fans, while CBS lawyer show “The Good Wife” starring Julianna Margulies topped an Xfinity TV poll on Facebook as favorite drama. “Dexter” and “Friday Night Lights” make up the other drama contenders.  ACTORS & ACTRESSES  Margulies also is the front-runner for best dramatic actress, along with Elisabeth Moss, who plays the quiet but feisty young Peggy Olson of “Mad Men.”  “It is such a great showcase for Moss. It is quite a contest. I think Margulies will win, but it is very close,” said Tom O’Neil of awards website TheEnvelope.com.  Jon Hamm, who plays suave but enigmatic Don Draper in “Mad Men,” also is hoping to clinch his first Emmy this year.  “Hamm is the lead star of this Emmy-anointed show who has never won. But he has got to watch out for Steve Buscemi on ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” said O’Neil.  The HBO miniseries “Mildred Pierce” has a leading 21 nominations and is expected to deliver an acting Emmy for its star, British actress Kate Winslet.  But surprises could be in store for Emmy newcomer Melissa McCarthy of comedy “Mike & Molly,” who also stole the show in the summer movie “Bridesmaids.”  “She is an outstanding comedic actress. She was also so funny and winning in ‘Bridesmaids’ and I think audiences got her and she won new fans,” said Todd Gold, managing editor of Xfinity TV.  The popular reality competition slot is also a cliffhanger.

175,CMCSA,"UPDATE 1-""Mad Men"" tries to fend off ""Boardwalk"" at Emmys"," * Miniseries “Mildred Pierce” leads with 21 nominations   * Close races in best drama series, drama acting  (Updates with red carpet arrivals)   By Jill Serjeant   LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Television’s “Mad Men” went to the Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, hoping to fend off the Prohibition-era gangsters of “Boardwalk Empire” and win a fourth straight victory at the industry’s top honors.   “Glee” star Chris Colfer, Christina Hendricks of “Mad Men” and Joel McHale of “Community” were among early arrivals on a red carpet packed with diamond jewelry and glorious gowns in shades of coral and pink.   More than 20 Emmys will be handed out in the live telecast on the Fox network hosted by “Glee” star Jane Lynch, who could find herself accepting an early award for her supporting actress role as a sarcastic cheerleading coach on the hit musical comedy.   But all eyes will be on the top prizes — for best comedy and drama series to be handed out at the end of the three-hour ceremony — and some major upsets could be in store, especially in the acting categories.   ABC mockumentary and 2010 Emmy comedy series winner “Modern Family” goes into Sunday’s awards with 17 nominations, including acting mentions for all six of its stars.   That puts it in a commanding position for a repeat victory over rivals “Glee,” “The Office,” “Parks and Recreation” and “The Big Bang Theory.”   The contest for best drama is much closer. HBO’s lavish new show “Boardwalk Empire,” with 18 nominations, has already taken Golden Globe and Screen Actor’s Guild trophies and is regarded as a major contender, despite the 19 nods to “Mad Men,” the 1960s advertising drama on AMC.   Medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones,” which proved a surprise success for HBO, has an army of fans, while CBS lawyer show “The Good Wife” starring Julianna Margulies topped an Xfinity TV poll on Facebook as favorite drama. “Dexter” and “Friday Night Lights” make up the other drama contenders.   ACTORS & ACTRESSES   Margulies also is the front-runner for best dramatic actress, along with Elisabeth Moss, who plays the quiet but feisty young Peggy Olson of “Mad Men.”   “It is such a great showcase for Moss. It is quite a contest. I think Margulies will win, but it is very close,” said Tom O’Neil of awards website TheEnvelope.com.   Jon Hamm, who plays suave but enigmatic Don Draper in “Mad Men,” also is hoping to clinch his first Emmy this year.   “Hamm is the lead star of this Emmy-anointed show who has never won. But he has got to watch out for Steve Buscemi on ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” said O’Neil.   The HBO miniseries “Mildred Pierce” has a leading 21 nominations and is expected to deliver an acting Emmy for its star, British actress Kate Winslet.   But surprises could be in store for Emmy newcomer Melissa McCarthy of comedy “Mike & Molly,” who also stole the show in the summer movie “Bridesmaids”.   “She is an outstanding comedic actress. She was also so funny and winning in ‘Bridesmaids’ and I think audiences got her and she won new fans,” said Todd Gold, managing editor of Xfinity TV.   The popular reality competition slot is also a cliffhanger. Victory may finally be at hand for America’s most-watched show “American Idol,” but “Dancing with the Stars” or “So You Think You Can Dance” could waltz away with the Emmy.

176,CMCSA,"3-D ""Lion King"" reigns at top of movie box office","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “The Lion King” is back on top of the movie jungle seventeen years after the film first hit theaters.  A 3-D version of the 1994 Walt Disney Co animated classic reclaimed the box office throne with a strong $29.3 million in domestic ticket sales over the weekend, studio estimates released on Sunday showed.  The three-day total for North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters was more than double studio forecasts and easily pushed thriller “Contagion,” last weekend’s winner, to second place.  “The Lion King” is one of the most successful animated films of all time, grossing $784 million at theaters worldwide before the 3-D debut. It also reigns as the top-performing home entertainment release ever. The film tells the story of a lion cub named Simba who returns from exile to claim the kingdom once led by his father.  The re-release appealed to parents and grandparents who saw the film years ago and brought their children and grandchildren to see it in a new format, said Dave Hollis, executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution at Disney, linking it to the movie’s “circle of life” theme.  “I’m very pleasantly surprised” with the opening weekend success, Hollis said, adding that Disney will consider extending the movie’s run beyond the planned two-week limited engagement.  Hollis said 92 percent of filmgoers opted to see the new 3D version. Theaters also showed the film in traditional 2D. The film collected an average of $12,575 per theater in 2,330 theaters.  The movie has rung up another $12 million since the 3D version was released in international markets a month ago.  A 3-D Blu-ray disc is set for release next month.  Thriller “Contagion,” a Steven Soderbergh-directed film about the race to stop a deadly virus as it circles the globe, finished second with $14.5 million. The movie’s sales dropped 35 percent from a week earlier and averaged $4,494 at 3,222 theaters.  Action flick “Drive,” starring Ryan Gosling, performed best among other new releases. The story of a Hollywood stunt performer who drives a getaway car for criminal landed third with $11 million domestically, hitting the low end of the studio’s expectations.  The film won strong reviews from critics and appealed to young males as well as “older and upscale audiences,” said Bob Berney, president of theatrical distribution of FilmDistrict, which released “Drive.”  Fourth place went to “The Help,” a drama about the relationships between white women and black maids in civil rights-era Mississippi, with $6.4 million. The domestic tally since the critics favorite opened six weeks ago reached $147.4 million, far exceeding early expectations.  Two newcomers struggled to draw audiences.  Thriller “Straw Dogs,” about a Hollywood screenwriter who finds trouble after relocating to his wife’s hometown, landed in fifth place with $5 million. The remake of a 1971 movie stars James Marsden, Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard.  Romantic comedy “I Don’t Know How She Does It,” starring Sarah Jessica Parker as a multi-tasking mom juggling her family and career as a finance executive, finished sixth with a disappointing $4.5 million domestically. Many movie-going moms likely opted to bring their kids to “The Lion King” instead, said Erik Lomis, president of distribution for The Weinstein Co.  “The Help” was produced by DreamWorks and released by Disney.

After months of anticipation, the stars and creators of dozens of comedies and dramas gather in Los Angeles for the annual Prime-time Emmy Awards ceremony that celebrates the best of television.

180,CMCSA,"Emmy viewers down, mixed reviews for host Jane Lynch","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Viewership for the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards fell 8 percent from last year to just over 12 million Americans who watched Jane Lynch host the heavily promoted TV show that drew mixed critical reviews.  According to preliminary viewing figures from media research company Nielsen, 12.4 million people watched the three-hour show, down from 13.5 million last year when the Emmys were moved to avoid competition from popular football games.  If the early results hold up, that would make Sunday’s Emmys on Fox one of the least viewed telecasts of the past five years. The show put on by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which gives awards for programs and performances, received its lowest ever audience in 2008 when 12.2 million Americans tuned in.  Time magazine blogger James Poniewozik described Lynch, who won an Emmy last year for her acid-tongued cheerleader coach role in “Glee”, as “game” in her hosting duties but said she “had only occasionally good material to work with.”  Hollywood paper Variety, on the other hand, said Lynch proved an inspired choice both in her off-the-cuff remarks and in videotaped sketches that skewered some of the biggest stars and shows on U.S. television.  “It may come as small comfort to Fox on a night when its shows failed to earn a single win, but the network knows how to throw a helluva of an Emmy Awards,” wrote Variety’s Andrew Wallenstein.  Entertainment Weekly’s Ken Tucker called Lynch a “spunky, clever host”. But for many critics, the best thing about the show was the touching moments when newcomers came up to the stage for the first time.  Six of the eight main acting awards went to Emmy first-timers, including Kyle Chandler for “Friday Night Lights”, Julie Bowen and Ty Burell for “Modern Family, and popular winner Melissa McCarthy for comedy “Mike & Molly.”  McCarthy’s beauty pageant-style “crowning” and the impromptu lining up on stage of all six comedy actress nominees was seen as one of the highlights of Sunday’s ceremony.  Advertising drama “Mad Men” and “Modern Family” took the top prizes again for best drama and comedy series.  Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said “the host and the surprises kept things pleasant if not scintillating.”  But Washington Post’s Hank Stuever felt the show lacked originality, saying “the year’s ‘biggest night in television’ fell flat in writing, performance and imagination, except in the most fleeting moments.”  (Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Bob Tourtellotte)  ",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-emmys-viewers/emmy-viewers-down-mixed-reviews-for-host-jane-lynch-idUSTRE78I4D020110919

183,CMCSA,Hulu sale at risk even as new bids are due,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The auction of online video site Hulu has been slowed by recent developments which could derail it completely, according to sources familiar with the process.  Among the issues are conflicts over complicated digital rights, a wide bid-ask gap, and Yahoo being sidelined as a potential buyer by its own issues. Moreover, NBC Universal’s hiring of Morgan Stanley banker Stuart Epstein, who was involved in the sale process for the bank, as its chief financial officer complicates a potential deal.  And then there is the lack of commitment to sell by Hulu’s owners — News Corp, Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and Providence Equity Partners.  News Corp Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey even acknowledged during the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month that a Hulu sale might not happen.  A new round of bids are due next week and price will be in a key issue in whether the auction moves forward, according to a source close to the situation.  Other sources with knowledge of the talks said an unusually wide gap has developed in recent weeks between the price bidders are offering and what the Hulu owners are willing to accept. Hulu’s owners are becoming more steadfast about the price and feel enough strategic alternatives are available to reject low-ball offers, sources said.  Bids have ranged from as low as $500 million to as much as $2 billion. The most serious suitors include Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc, DirecTV Group Inc and DISH Network Corp.  Yahoo Inc had been viewed as one of the most enthusiastic likely bidders, but that was before its leadership imploded last week with the firing of CEO Carol Bartz. The company is likely to be too preoccupied with its own issues to digest a multibillion dollar deal. Moreover, Hulu’s owners would be reluctant to sell to a company undergoing an internal upheaval.  As with any sale, the situation is fluid and there remains a chance Google or another party could swoop in with a rich offer. Reports have suggested Google was planning an offer, but company insiders are uncertain Hulu’s media owners would sanction a sale to the search engine giant — at least not without caveats such as blocking piracy searches, for example.  After intense initial interest due to Hulu’s huge and growing popularity, the sale has stalled as bidders questioned what they would get for their money.  One senior media executive said the nature of Hulu’s content deals is key to whether a deal happens or not.  “I guess the brand and technology are worth something, but probably not for that asking price because digital companies could develop a site on their own,” the executive said, who asked not to be identified speaking about a partner company.  CBS Corp boss Les Moonves openly questioned Hulu’s value during an interview at a Paley Media Center event on Thursday.  “What are they getting and how long are they getting it?” asked Moonves, whose company is not a Hulu owner or content provider. “Are they buying two years of programs for $2 billion? I don’t know. I shouldn’t say more, I’ll get in trouble.”  The issue of rights, particularly on newer platforms such as the Web and mobile, are both unclear and complicated, adding to the potential deal’s complexity.  BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said a recent decision by NBC Universal to offer programs for free via an iPhone and iPad app without requiring a cable subscription effectively undermines the value of the rights Hulu’s owners are trying to sell. The move also potentially conflicts with News Corp unit Fox TV’s strategy of allowing Hulu users to access only the latest TV shows if they are a pay-TV subscriber.  “It gets more challenging to push through the Hulu sale, given what NBC just did,” said Greenfield.  Comcast agreed, as part of the regulatory restrictions attached to its takeover of NBCU, that NBCU would abstain from key management decisions at Hulu.  If the sale falls apart, it will mark the second time its owners have fashioned a full or partial exit strategy that has failed. After nearly six months of planning, the owners ditched an initial public offering last December to raise up to $300 million. Such an IPO would have valued the company at about $2 billion. [nN06205589]  But the decision to ditch the IPO in favor of a sale prompted industry observers to wonder whether media companies should risk handing over their future online to digital rivals such as Google and Amazon. Greenfield has described the plan to sell Hulu as a mistake of “epic proportions.”  “Hulu appears to be the perfect weapon for networks and content creators to embrace so they can grow revenues and profits, even if the current multichannel ecosystem becomes unglued over the next decade,” said Greenfield in his client-targeted blog.

The most serious suitors include Google Inc (GOOG.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), DirecTV Group Inc DTV.O and DISH Network Corp (DISH.O).   Yahoo Inc YHOO.O had been viewed as one of the most enthusiastic likely bidders, but that was before its leadership imploded last week with the firing of CEO Carol Bartz. The company is likely to be too preoccupied with its own issues to digest a multibillion dollar deal. Moreover, Hulu’s owners would be reluctant to sell to a company undergoing an internal upheaval.   As with any sale, the situation is fluid and there remains a chance Google or another party could swoop in with a rich offer. Reports have suggested Google was planning an offer, but company insiders are uncertain Hulu’s media owners would sanction a sale to the search engine giant — at least not without caveats such as blocking piracy searches, for example.   After intense initial interest due to Hulu’s huge and growing popularity, the sale has stalled as bidders questioned what they would get for their money.   One senior media executive said the nature of Hulu’s content deals is key to whether a deal happens or not.   “I guess the brand and technology are worth something, but probably not for that asking price because digital companies could develop a site on their own,” the executive said, who asked not to be identified speaking about a partner company.   CBS Corp (CBS.N) boss Les Moonves openly questioned Hulu’s value during an interview at a Paley Media Center event on Thursday.   “What are they getting and how long are they getting it?” asked Moonves, whose company is not a Hulu owner or content provider. “Are they buying two years of programs for $2 billion? I don’t know. I shouldn’t say more, I’ll get in trouble.”   The issue of rights, particularly on newer platforms such as the Web and mobile, are both unclear and complicated, adding to the potential deal’s complexity.   BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said a recent decision by NBC Universal to offer programs for free via an iPhone and iPad app without requiring a cable subscription effectively undermines the value of the rights Hulu’s owners are trying to sell. The move also potentially conflicts with News Corp unit Fox TV’s strategy of allowing Hulu users to access only the latest TV shows if they are a pay-TV subscriber.   “It gets more challenging to push through the Hulu sale, given what NBC just did,” said Greenfield.   Comcast agreed, as part of the regulatory restrictions attached to its takeover of NBCU, that NBCU would abstain from key management decisions at Hulu.   If the sale falls apart, it will mark the second time its owners have fashioned a full or partial exit strategy that has failed. After nearly six months of planning, the owners ditched an initial public offering last December to raise up to $300 million. Such an IPO would have valued the company at about $2 billion. [nN06205589]   But the decision to ditch the IPO in favor of a sale prompted industry observers to wonder whether media companies should risk handing over their future online to digital rivals such as Google and Amazon. Greenfield has described the plan to sell Hulu as a mistake of “epic proportions.”   “Hulu appears to be the perfect weapon for networks and content creators to embrace so they can grow revenues and profits, even if the current multichannel ecosystem becomes unglued over the next decade,” said Greenfield in his client-targeted blog.

186,CMCSA,"UPDATE 5-'Mad Men', 'Modern Family' win Emmys but shocks abound"," * “Mad Men” makes it four. “Modern Family” best comedy   * First time wins for Kyle Chandler, Melissa McCarthy   * Disappointing night for “Glee”  (Recasts at end of awards show)   By Jill Serjeant   LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters) - “Mad Men” and “Modern Family” won television’s top drama and comedy prizes again on Sunday but elsewhere it was out with the old and in with the new at the Primetime Emmy Awards.   On a night of surprises that brought a slew of newcomers to the Emmy podium, “Mad Men” won best drama series for a fourth straight year but the waiting got tense as the 1960s advertising drama lost out in all the acting, writing and directing races.   “I did not think that was going to happen,” creator Matthew Weiner said, accepting the best drama series trophy. “Mad Men” went home with just two Emmys — including one from last week’s creative arts ceremony — even though it came into the awards show with 19 nominations.   “We were shut out, but then we also won this (best drama) award so it balances out. To me this is the prize that says people love what we are doing,” Weiner said backstage.   The story was different for “Modern Family.” Along with its best comedy win, the ABC mockumentary about three assorted couples and their children brought first-time wins for Julie Bowen and her screen husband Ty Burrell in the supporting acting slots, and Emmys for directing and writing.   Creator Steve Levitan called the wins “an embarrassment of riches” while actor Ed O’Neill said “it was better than the first time. To repeat is difficult. I am relieved.”   “Welcome back to the ‘Modern Family’ awards!” Emmy ceremony host Jane Lynch quipped early in the evening.   Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet won her first Emmy for her lead role in the HBO miniseries “Mildred Pierce.” But the British period show “Downton Abbey,” shown on PBS, was the miniseries winner, giving it a total of six Emmys overall.   “I didn’t think we were going to win anything!” Winslet said.   Elsewhere, a host of new faces took home Emmys in a night that defied most predictions.   The little-seen but critically admired football drama “Friday Night Lights” won for best writing and its star Kyle Chandler beat favorites Jon Hamm and Steve Buscemi for best dramatic actor.   Melissa McCarthy won lead comedy actress at her first shot for the CBS romantic comedy “Mike & Molly,” in which she plays an overweight teacher.   Emmy rookie Peter Dinklage won for his turn as the clever but rude Tyrion in HBO’s popular medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones,” while Margo Martindale was an emotional first-time winner for her supporting actress role in FX drama “Justified,” which came to the veteran actress after more than 20 years in the business.   Julianna Margulies, star of “The Good Wife” on CBS, won the race for best dramatic actress. Jim Parsons was a rare repeat winner for comedy “The Big Bang Theory” in a category that most pundits had thought would finally go to departing “The Office” star Steve Carell.   “I am really flabbergasted. I am more shocked this year,” Parsons told reporters backstage.   Jaw-dropping moments were not only reserved for the winners.   Fox musical comedy “Glee” — one of the most talked about shows of the last two years — won just two Emmys, both in creative arts categories, while HBO’s lavish “Boardwalk Empire” won seven of its eight total Emmys in last week’s technical awards section. Its only win on Sunday night went to director Martin Scorsese.   HBO was the biggest network winner with 19 Emmys, followed by 14 for PBS, 11 for CBS, nine for Fox, eight for ABC and six for NBC.   Among the show’s highlights was a smiling and apparently sincere Charlie Sheen, on the comeback trail after months of erratic behavior that resulted in his firing from CBS hit “Two and A Half Men.” He was a last minute addition as a presenter.   “From the bottom of my heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season,” Sheen said of his former program that previously this year he had sharply criticized.   “American Idol” — the most-watched show on U.S. television for the past seven years — was left empty-handed again in the reality competition show race, which was won by long-running Emmy favorite “The Amazing Race.”  (Editing by Eric Beech and Bob Tourtellotte)    ",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/emmys/update-5-mad-men-modern-family-win-emmys-but-shocks-abound-idUSS1E78H07D20110919

190,CMCSA,Comcast sues to void 8 BT Group network patents," * Comcast says did not infringe eight BT patents   * BT threatening to add Comcast to lawsuit, Comcast says   * Lawsuit seeks to void patents   Sept 20 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), the largest U.S. cable television company, has filed a lawsuit seeking to void eight network patents held by BT Group Plc (BT.L), the large British phone company.   According to the complaint, BT is planning to add Comcast as a defendant in a separate year-old case, and plans to accuse it of infringing the eight patents by providing cable Internet and telephone services in the United States.   Comcast said such claims are false. Citing a “substantial and immediate controversy,” it is seeking a court order declaring both that it has not infringed BT’s patents, and that the patents themselves are invalid.   The patents cover such things as network communications, pricing methods and “fault monitoring,” according to the complaint made public on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware.   BT did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment.   Based in Philadelphia, Comcast in 2010 posted $37.9 billion of revenue. This year, it took a controlling stake in NBC Universal, which includes the NBC television network. Comcast’s cable networks include Bravo, MSNBC and USA Network.   BT posted revenue of about $31.5 billion in its fiscal year ended March 31, a regulatory filing shows. The company operates in more than 170 countries.   The case is Comcast Cable Communications LLC et al v. British Telecommunications Plc, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 11-00843.

191,CMCSA,Hulu has more than 1 million paying subscribers: CEO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hulu, the popular online video service which has been put up for sale by its joint owners, now has more than 1 million paying subscribers, Chief Executive Jason Kilar said on Wednesday.  Earlier this year Kilar forecast that Hulu would have 1 million subscribers by the end of the year. He confirmed that it reached that milestone at the end of the summer and the site is now on its way to easily exceed that number by year’s end.  The site made its name as a free service for popular broadcast TV shows like The Office and Modern Family soon after the shows had been aired.  The shows and movies it initially featured were supplied by its joint equity owners News Corp, Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal. Its fourth co-owner is private equity firm Providence Equity Partners.  Hulu launched a subscription tier last November and has since added more content from partners including Viacom and Hollywood studio Miramax.  Kilar said customers’ preference for TV shows and library content on Hulu and Netflix Inc is a function of the deals the sites are able to reach with programmers within the constraints of their respective financial models.  “We will invest over $375 million in content this year,” said Kilar, speaking at a Goldman Sachs investor conference.  Kilar has previously said the company will have around $500 million in revenue this year.  Some programmers have been reluctant to do major U.S. deals with Hulu due to concerns that it might undercut their relationships with pay-TV distributors. CBS Corp boss Les Moonves in particular has been the most vocal about his caution with Hulu, even though his company inked a deal with Hulu in Japan.  “I’m cautiously optimistic that we’ll work with everyone over time,” Kilar said.  Kilar was complementary about the risks Hulu’s owners had taken in setting up and supporting the business to date even though those owners put Hulu up for sale earlier this year.  Reuters reported last week that the $2 billion sale had hit speed bumps in recent weeks as the owners reconsidered whether a sale is still the best strategy.  “We’re still evaluating the situation,” said News Corp Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey, speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the conference — reiterating recent comments on a quarterly earnings call. He declined to comment further.  Earlier in the summer Disney CEO Bob Iger had said the owners were fully committed to selling Hulu.  NBC Universal is not actively involved in the sale process. Comcast agreed NBC Universal would not participate in management decisions of Hulu in order to receive regulatory approval for its takeover of the broadcaster and cable giant.  Critics of the plan to sell Hulu argue the owners should keep hold of a major distribution channel of the future rather than sell to possible new owners like Google, Amazon.com or Yahoo.

193,CMCSA,"DirecTV customer growth ""very good"" in Q3: CEO","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leading U.S. satellite TV provider DirecTV Group is having a “very, very good” third quarter in terms of subscriber growth, Chief Executive Mike White said on Thursday.  “We’re very pleased with the trends we’ve seen with gross adds and customer churn,” White said at a Goldman Sachs investor conference.  Customer churn is a metric used to measure the rate at which customers cancel their subscriptions. White said the customer churn numbers for the quarter had been “excellent.”  The former PepsiCo executive said the quarter was helped partly by his decision to give away DirecTV’s exclusive package of NFL football games, NFL Sunday Ticket, to new customers as a one-year promotion.  The strategy to win sports fans from rival satellite company Dish Network Corp, as well as cable and telephone competitors appears to be bearing fruit.  White said the NFL Sunday Ticket promotion was not undertaken because of the current macroeconomic pressures that all pay-TV companies are facing. He pointed out that, because the company pays a fixed amount to the NFL for the programing rights, it makes no difference if DirecTV gives it away in the hope of retaining the new customers after the promotion expires.  The Sunday Ticket give-away has already caused controversy with rivals. Last month, Comcast Corp sued DirecTV over what it claimed were “false ads” for the Sunday Ticket promotion. A Federal judge later denied Comcast’s request for a restraining order.

After months of hype and bold predictions by its creator Simon Cowell, just 12.1 million Americans tuned in for the debut of “The X Factor” on Fox — about half the audience for the most recent season of “American Idol”.  Instead, “Modern Family” — the affectionate ABC mockumentary that won big at the Emmy Awards last weekend — drew 14.3 million viewers to make it the most-watched TV show of Wednesday night, early numbers for Nielsen media research showed.  Critics were also mostly underwhelmed by “X Factor”, which Cowell had predicted earlier this year would thrash the competition and replace “Idol” as the most-watched show on U.S. television.  “It quickly becomes clear that this series, which has billed itself as a new type of competition show, really just remixes the well-established gimmicks of the earlier entries in the genre,” wrote Neil Genzlinger of the New York Times.  As for the acid-tongued Cowell — the “X Factor” creator, executive producer and judge — Genzlinger said, “This magician no longer has a curtain hiding the secrets of his tricks.”  Hollywood trade paper Variety said the series appeared “even more emotionally manipulative and over-produced than its (‘Idol’) predecessor.”  And an extended sequence in which a contestant dropped his pants but was allowed to continue performing was a turn-off for many.  “When a man is allowed to ‘sing’ a song about being a stud while shaking his presumably naked genitals at the audience (on the screen they are covered by an X) without the judges stopping him...the narrative manipulation suggests the word ‘desperate,’” said Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times.

197,CMCSA,U.S. Internet rules to take effect November 20,"(Reuters) - Long-delayed U.S. Internet rules that tackle the controversial issue of balancing consumer and content provider interests against those who sell access to the Web will take effect November 20.  The Federal Communications Commission’s “open Internet” order was published in the Federal Register on Friday, and immediately drew threats of court and congressional challenges.  The rules were adopted by the FCC late last year after a lengthy debate, but only recently cleared a review by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.  Criticized by opponents as a legally shaky government intrusion into regulating the Internet, the new rules forbid broadband providers from blocking legal content but leave flexibility for providers to manage their networks.  Broadband provider Verizon Communications Inc has been a vociferous opponent, and renewed its pledge to take the FCC to court as soon as the rules are published.  “We have said all along that once we see the publication ... we intend to file another notice of appeal,” Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden said.  For the past 10 years, the possibility of regulations to mandate the neutrality of the Internet — in terms of restrictions on content, sites, platforms and types of equipment that may be attached — has been the subject of fierce debate.  The latest rulemaking was prompted by a U.S. federal appeals court ruling last year that the FCC lacked the authority to stop Comcast Corp from blocking bandwidth-hogging applications on its broadband network.  The rules, adopted last December in a 3-2 vote, give the FCC power to ensure consumer access to huge movie files and other content while allowing Internet service providers to manage their networks to prevent congestion.  An FCC spokesman said the rules increase certainty and predictability, stimulating investment and ensuring job creation and economic growth.  But public interest groups criticized the rules as too weak, saying the FCC bent heavily to the will of big industry players including AT&T Inc and Comcast.  Matt Wood, policy director of public interest group Free Press, said broadband providers will be able to divide the Internet into “fast and slow lanes” and that the rules fail to protect mobile broadband users.  “Even in their watered-down form, the rules might do some good — but that would require a vigilant FCC to carefully monitor and address complaints,” Wood said in a statement, adding that he doubted the agency would do enough to protect consumers.  While some public interest groups had considered a lawsuit to strengthen the rules, they now seem focused on ensuring the rules stay in place.  “We are prepared to vigorously defend the FCC’s rules in court and in Congress,” said Gigi Sohn, president of Public Knowledge. She said the rules are a good start despite not being as strong as she had hoped.

198,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-U.S. Internet rules to take effect Nov. 20," * Controversial rules published in Federal Register   * Court and congressional challenges loom   * Consumer groups say rules weak but will defend them  (Adds comments from FCC, public interest group, senator)   By Jasmin Melvin   Sept 23 (Reuters) - Long-delayed U.S. Internet rules that tackle the controversial issue of balancing consumer and content provider interests against those who sell access to the Web will take effect Nov. 20.   The Federal Communications Commission’s “open Internet” order was published in the Federal Register on Friday, and immediately drew threats of court and congressional challenges.   The rules were adopted by the FCC late last year after a lengthy debate, but only recently cleared a review by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.   Criticized by opponents as a legally shaky government intrusion into regulating the Internet, the new rules forbid broadband providers from blocking legal content but leave flexibility for providers to manage their networks.   Broadband provider Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) has been a vociferous opponent, and renewed its pledge to take the FCC to court as soon as the rules are published.   “We have said all along that once we see the publication ... we intend to file another notice of appeal,” Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden said.   For the past 10 years, the possibility of regulations to mandate the neutrality of the Internet — in terms of restrictions on content, sites, platforms and types of equipment that may be attached — has been the subject of fierce debate.   The latest rulemaking was prompted by a U.S. federal appeals court ruling last year that the FCC lacked the authority to stop Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) from blocking bandwidth-hogging applications on its broadband network.   The rules, adopted last December in a 3-2 vote, give the FCC power to ensure consumer access to huge movie files and other content while allowing Internet service providers to manage their networks to prevent congestion.   An FCC spokesman said the rules increase certainty and predictability, stimulating investment and ensuring job creation and economic growth.   But public interest groups criticized the rules as too weak, saying the FCC bent heavily to the will of big industry players including AT&T Inc (T.N) and Comcast.   Matt Wood, policy director of public interest group Free Press, said broadband providers will be able to divide the Internet into “fast and slow lanes” and that the rules fail to protect mobile broadband users.   “Even in their watered-down form, the rules might do some good — but that would require a vigilant FCC to carefully monitor and address complaints,” Wood said in a statement, adding that he doubted the agency would do enough to protect consumers.   While some public interest groups had considered a lawsuit to strengthen the rules, they now seem focused on ensuring the rules stay in place.   “We are prepared to vigorously defend the FCC’s rules in court and in Congress,” said Gigi Sohn, president of Public Knowledge. She said the rules are a good start despite not being as strong as she had hoped.   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in April threw out earlier challenges to the FCC’s open Internet order by Verizon and MetroPCS Communications Inc PCS.N, dismissing their lawsuits as premature.   FCC rulemakings generally cannot be challenged until the rules are published in the Federal Register.

199,CMCSA,US 'Net neutrality' rules to take effect in Nov.,"   * FCC gives Nov. 20 date for controversial Net rules   * Court and congressional challenges sure to come   * Consumer groups say rules favor big industry players   By Jasmin Melvin   Sept 23 (Reuters) - Long-awaited U.S. rules addressing the hot-button issue of balancing consumer and content providers’ interests against those of Internet service providers will take effect on Nov. 20.   The regulations covering so-called Net neutrality, published in the Federal Register on Friday, are sure to trigger legal and congressional challenges. They were adopted by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission late last year after a lengthy debate.

For the past 10 years, the possibility of regulations to mandate the neutrality of the Internet — in terms of restrictions on content, sites, platforms and types of equipment that may be attached — has been the subject of fierce debate.   The fight pits content providers who seek protection against the blocking or degrading of their services against Internet service providers that want to “control the pipeline.”   The rules, adopted last December in a 3-2 vote, give the FCC power to ensure consumer access to huge movie files and other content while allowing ISPs to manage their networks to prevent congestion.   But public interest groups criticized the rules, saying they bent heavily to the will of big industry players including AT&T Inc (T.N) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA.O)   Matt Wood, policy director of public interest group Free Press, said loopholes will still allow broadband providers to divide the Internet into “fast and slow lanes” and that the rules fail to protect mobile broadband users.   “Even in their watered-down form, the rules might do some good — but that would require a vigilant FCC to carefully monitor and address complaints,” Wood said in a statement, adding that he doubted the agency would do enough to protect consumers.

200,CMCSA,"3D ""Lion King"" rules box office for second week","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “The Lion King” fended off Brad Pitt to keep the box-office crown for a second straight weekend.  Walt Disney Co’s 3D re-release of the animated classic rang up an estimated $22.1 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales over three days as families turned out to see lion cub Simba’s return to theaters.  Baseball drama “Moneyball” starring Pitt took second and family film “Dolphin Tale” finished a close third, according to studio projections released on Sunday.  Ticket sales for “The Lion King 3D” have far surpassed industry expectations for a movie that debuted in 1994 and will soon hit stores on Blu-ray disc. The film has grossed $61.7 million in North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters since its release last weekend, plus $16 million in international markets, where it came out more than a month ago.  Combined, the “Lion King” re-release has brought in $77.7 million around the world. Disney will extend the planned two-week run in theaters, said Dave Hollis, executive vice president for motion picture sales and distribution at Disney.  “We are working to meet that demand,” Hollis said.  Baseball and math didn’t quite add up to a box-office win for “Moneyball,” which finished in second place with $20.6 million domestically. Pitt plays real-life Oakland A’s general manager Billy Beane, who used unconventional statistical analysis to field a small-budget team of overlooked players to make an unlikely playoff run.  The movie won positive reviews from critics and received an A rating from audiences polled by CinemaScore.  The film was based on a nonfiction book by Michael Lewis and cost about $50 million to produce. Sales hit the high end of studio projections, said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Columbia Pictures, which released the film.  Close behind was another story from the animal kingdom. “Dolphin Tale” brought in an estimated $20.3 million to take third place, a strong showing for a family film against the mighty performance from “Lion King.”  The movie, starring Harry Connick Jr., Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman, is based on the true story of a dolphin that loses its tail in a crab trap and is rehabilitated with a prosthetic tail. The real dolphin that inspired the story portrays the dolphin in the film.  The movie won a rare A+ rating from audiences polled by CinemaScore. Also offered in 3D, the film was produced by Alcon Entertainment for about $37 million.  Action film “Abduction,” starring and produced by “Twilight” heartthrob Taylor Lautner in his first major role outside the popular vampire and werewolf series, pulled in $11.2 million to take fourth place.  In “Abduction,” Lautner plays a teenager on the run after he discovers his parents aren’t who he thought they were and his life has been a lie. He pieces together the truth while being pursued by the FBI and killer assassins. The film cost Lions Gate Entertainment about $35 million to make.  Spy thriller “Killer Elite,” starring Robert de Niro, Clive Owen and Jason Stratham, finished in fifth place with $9.5 million. The film is the first movie released by Open Road Films, a joint venture between theater owners Regal Entertainment Group and AMC Entertainment Inc.  The weekend also saw surprise summer hit “The Smurfs” crossing a milestone with more than $500 million in global ticket sales since the 3D live-action and animated family film debuted in July.

206,CMCSA,"In switch, cable operators want to go ""a la carte""","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cable operators are privately working on a plan to force programmers to unbundle their networks and allow customers to subscribe to channels on an individual basis.  The plan represents a complete reversal from cable operators’ long-held opposition to what is known as “a la carte” programing. Over the last decade, the cable industry battled ferociously with regulators to protect the right to bundle programing, arguing it offered customers the best value.  But executives now say the change is a necessary response to shifting dynamics such as higher carriage costs and using the Web to watch programs, as well as a weak economic recovery that has forced many consumers to cancel cable television subscriptions.  Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable, the two largest operators have lost 1.2 million video customers in the 12 months to June 30.  Pay-TV distributors such as Time Warner Cable and Cablevision are searching for a business or regulatory strategy to lower escalating programing costs, which have risen between 6 and 10 percent each year during the last decade, according to industry sources.  An “a la carte” menu of programing would give consumers who are not sports fans the freedom to drop high cost sports channels such as Walt Disney Co’s ESPN and ESPN 2 from basic packages. At around $4 a subscriber, ESPN is the most expensive channel in the cable business, according to SNL Kagan.  “We feel that some of those expensive channels should be offered a la carte so only those people who want to watch them actually pay for them,” said Jerry Kent, chief executive of Suddenlink, which has 1.3 million cable customers.  Rocco Commisso, chief executive of Mediacom, which has 1.2 million subscribers, sent a letter to Federal Communications Chairman Julius Genachowski earlier this month that suggested “instituting a carefully designed a la carte system, so that decisions about what video services are bought are made by consumers themselves, rather than by content owners.”  The specter of unbundled programing is likely to encounter fierce resistance from network owners such as Viacom Inc or Discovery Communications Inc, which are keen to maintain the economics of selling their most popular channels as a package with their smaller, nascent networks.  The cable operators’ plan is motivated in part by the high cost of sports programing rights, which have skyrocketed in recent years. ESPN recently singed a $15 billion, 8-year TV rights deal with the National Football League, a 73 percent premium over their previous agreement. Cable operators, fearful of having to pay for the increase or pass it on to customers, harshly criticized the deal.  Cable and satellite companies have also had to start paying for the right to carry Disney’s ABC, CBS Corp’s CBS, Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and News Corp’s Fox. Those free-to-air broadcast networks traditionally had been carried by cable operators at little, if any, expense.  Federal rules require cable distributors to carry local broadcast stations, which they argue gives broadcasters an unfair advantage in contract talks.  The so-called retransmission fee debate has already led to high profile blackouts of local TV stations in the last few years after contract negotiations between pay-TV companies and broadcasters broke down over payment terms.  “There is a growing recognition that the current model is broken,” said Craig Moffett, a long-time cable analyst at Bernstein Research.  Moffett warned, however, that allowing customers to choose any station they wanted in any package would be economically unfeasible for both the consumer and the cable company.  “It could be a la carte, but not as people imagine it now,” he said referring to smaller packs of programing more akin to what Time Warner Cable Inc has tried. Last November, Time Warner Cable launched a three-city trial of a low cost TV Essentials pack with fewer channels. It now plans to expand that offer to other cities.

207,CMCSA,"In switch, cable operators want to go ""a la carte"""," * Operators want to give consumers choice to lower costs   * Programmers will resist attempts to unbundle programs   * Sports rights and retransmission fees are biggest costs   By Yinka Adegoke   NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - U.S. cable operators are privately working on a plan to force programmers to unbundle their networks and allow customers to subscribe to channels on an individual basis.   The plan represents a complete reversal from cable operators’ long-held opposition to what is known as “a la carte” programming. Over the last decade, the cable industry battled ferociously with regulators to protect the right to bundle programming, arguing it offered customers the best value.   But executives now say the change is a necessary response to shifting dynamics such as higher carriage costs and using the Web to watch programs, as well as a weak economic recovery that has forced many consumers to cancel cable television subscriptions.   Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable, the two largest operators have lost 1.2 million video customers in the 12 months to June 30.   Pay-TV distributors such as Time Warner Cable and Cablevision are searching for a business or regulatory strategy to lower escalating programming costs, which have risen between 6 and 10 percent each year during the last decade, according to industry sources.   An “a la carte” menu of programming would give consumers who are not sports fans the freedom to drop high cost sports channels such as Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) ESPN and ESPN 2 from basic packages. At around $4 a subscriber, ESPN is the most expensive channel in the U.S. cable business, according to SNL Kagan.   “We feel that some of those expensive channels should be offered a la carte so only those people who want to watch them actually pay for them,” said Jerry Kent, chief executive of Suddenlink, which has 1.3 million cable customers.   Rocco Commisso, chief executive of Mediacom, which has 1.2 million subscribers, sent a letter to Federal Communications Chairman Julius Genachowski earlier this month that suggested “instituting a carefully designed a la carte system, so that decisions about what video services are bought are made by consumers themselves, rather than by content owners.”   The specter of unbundled programming is likely to encounter fierce resistance from network owners such as Viacom Inc VIAb.N or Discovery Communications Inc (DISCA.O), which are keen to maintain the economics of selling their most popular channels as a package with their smaller, nascent networks.   The cable operators’ plan is motivated in part by the high cost of sports programming rights, which have skyrocketed in recent years. ESPN recently singed a $15 billion, 8-year TV rights deal with the National Football League, a 73 percent premium over their previous agreement. Cable operators, fearful of having to pay for the increase or pass it on to customers, harshly criticized the deal.   Cable and satellite companies have also had to start paying for the right to carry Disney’s ABC, CBS Corp’s (CBS.N) CBS, Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBC Universal and News Corp’s (NWSA.O) Fox. Those free-to-air broadcast networks traditionally had been carried by cable operators at little, if any, expense.   Federal rules require cable distributors to carry local broadcast stations, which they argue gives broadcasters an unfair advantage in contract talks.   The so-called retransmission fee debate has already led to high profile blackouts of local TV stations in the last few years after contract negotiations between pay-TV companies and broadcasters broke down over payment terms.   “There is a growing recognition that the current model is broken,” said Craig Moffett, a long-time cable analyst at Bernstein Research.   Moffett warned, however, that allowing customers to choose any station they wanted in any package would be economically unfeasible for both the consumer and the cable company.   “It could be a la carte, but not as people imagine it now,” he said referring to smaller packs of programming more akin to what Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N has tried. Last November, Time Warner Cable launched a three-city trial of a low cost TV Essentials pack with fewer channels. It now plans to expand that offer to other cities.

208,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-Consumer group challenges new U.S. Internet rules," * Free Press disputes distinction between wired, wireless   * More suits expected now rules published  (Adds details from court petition, FCC comment, background)   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Public interest group Free Press mounted the first challenge to new U.S. Internet traffic rules since they were published last week, seeking to strengthen protections for wireless users.   The petition filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston on Wednesday, challenges provisions in the Federal Communications Commission’s Open Internet order that give wireless broadband providers more discretion in managing their networks.   “When the FCC first proposed the Open Internet rules, they came with the understanding that there is only one Internet, no matter how people choose to reach it,” said Matt Wood, policy director for Free Press.   The rules, adopted last December by the FCC in a 3-2 vote, forbid broadband providers from blocking legal content while leaving flexibility for providers to manage their networks.   FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski supported giving wireless Internet providers even greater freedom to manage traffic, in recognition of wireless’ status as a younger technology.   Supporters of the wireless portion of the plan said it recognized the limited bandwidth available to support everything from telephone calls to movie downloads.   Public interest groups have criticized the rules as too weak, saying the FCC was swayed by big industry players including AT&T Inc (T.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).   Free Press said it planned to show that no evidence in the record justified making a distinction between mobile and fixed Internet access.   The group said the leeway given to mobile broadband providers would allow them to “block innovative applications with impunity.”   “It’s especially problematic because of the increasing popularity of wireless, along with its increasing importance for younger demographics and diverse populations who rely on mobile devices as their primary means for getting online,” Wood said.   The so-called “net neutrality” debate pits content providers, who seek protection against the blocking or degrading of their services, against Internet service providers who often supply rival content.   Proponents of net neutrality rules say that these big providers could otherwise use their gatekeeper role to discriminate against competitors. Internet providers say they need to be able to manage their networks for all users.   An FCC spokesman said the rules have brought certainty and predictability, stimulating investment and innovation in mobile networks and applications.   “We will vigorously oppose any effort to disrupt or unsettle that certainty, which ensures that the Internet remains an engine for job creation, innovation and economic growth,” the spokesman said.   Further challenges to the Internet rules are expected.   Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and MetroPCS Communications PCS.N filed lawsuits earlier in the year, accusing the FCC of overstepping its authority.   Both suits were dismissed in April as premature by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as the rules had not been officially published.   The rules were published last week, setting Nov. 20 as their start date.

209,CMCSA,Netflix shares fall as competition heats up,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) shares slumped 11 percent on Thursday as competitors made moves to attract more customers with alternative options for movie and television content.  Thursday’s losses added to a staggering drop for Netflix shares from a high of nearly $300 in July following a series of missteps. In afternoon Nasdaq trading, Netflix shares were down 11.4 percent at $112.62. That was 62 percent lower than July’s high.  Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) a day earlier unveiled a tablet computer called the Amazon Fire, a rival to Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) dominant iPad and another device to offer online streaming of TV and film entertainment.  The Amazon announcement, plus a report that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) was planning to expand content available through its Xbox gaming console, likely weighed on Netflix shares, Merriman Capital analyst Eric Wold said.  “I think people are concerned about the competitive pressures,” Wold said.  “As more competitors add content and add new ways for consumers to access that content, it could pose a risk to Netflix.”  Wold has a “buy” rating on Netflix shares based on its position as an industry leader and long-term growth opportunities.  Bloomberg reported early on Thursday that Microsoft plans to offer online pay television service from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) through the Xbox Live streaming service as soon as next week.  Netflix has stumbled with a series of missteps in the past few months. The company announced an unpopular price increase for DVD service in July, failed to secure content from cable channel operator Starz beyond February and lowered subscriber forecasts in the face of customer cancellations.  CEO Reed Hastings further angered customers by separating the DVD and streaming services on different websites.

210,CMCSA,Verizon asks court to halt FCC net neutrality rule,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc on Friday asked a federal appeals court to block the Federal Communications Commission from imposing new rules on how Internet service providers manage their networks.  The FCC last Friday said its so-called net neutrality rules were scheduled to take effect on November 20.  These rules would forbid broadband providers from blocking users from accessing lawful content, such as movie files, while giving the providers flexibility to manage their networks and prevent congestion.  Critics call the rules an unwarranted government intrusion into regulating the Internet, including which content consumers may access and which companies may provide that content.  In a filing with the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., Verizon said the FCC was “arbitrary” and “capricious” and acted beyond its statutory authority in imposing the rules.  The rules “impose potentially sweeping and unneeded regulations on broadband networks and services and on the Internet itself,” Michael Glover, deputy general counsel at Verizon, said in a statement.  “Verizon is fully committed to an open Internet, he added.  New York-based Verizon is one of the largest U.S. phone companies, and with Vodafone Group Plc owns Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. mobile phone service.

213,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-'Dolphin Tale' jumps to top of movie box office," * Upbeat films lead weekend with $14.2 mln for ‘Dolphin’   * ‘Moneyball’ second, ‘Lion King’ slips to third  (Adds details)   By Lisa Richwine   LOS ANGELES, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Simba the lion may rule the jungle, but he couldn’t beat a plucky dolphin at the weekend box office.   Family film “Dolphin Tale” made a surprising leap to first place with a projected $14.2 million in domestic ticket sales over three days, studio estimates released on Sunday showed.   The movie about an injured dolphin rehabilitated with a prosthetic tail, which finished third last week, knocked “The Lion King 3D” from the box office throne it held the past two weekends. “Lion King” dropped to third with $11.1 million.   In between the animal-themed family films was “Moneyball,” a baseball drama starring Brad Pitt as a general manager who fields a small-budget team of unlikely contenders. The film finished in second place with $12.5 million at North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters.   All three holdover films outranked four newcomers, showing the appeal in recent weeks of feel-good movies over heavier-themed films.   The fall movie season, typically a time for more serious films, has “seen a shift to the more upbeat and even inspirational films and family fare,” said Paul Dergarabedian, who heads up Hollywood.com Box Office.   “Dolphin Tale” has gained on strong word-of-mouth buzz after rave reviews from critics and moviegoers, said Andrew Kosove, co-CEO of Alcon Entertainment, the studio that produced the film. The movie is one of just a few this year to earn an A+ rating from audiences polled by survey firm CinemaScore.   “The Lion King” also has drawn filmgoers with a triumphant story despite being a 17-year-old film. The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) animated classic has rung up $79.7 million domestically and $19 million in international markets since it returned to theaters last month.   Combined, “Lion King” has grossed $98.7 million during its new run.   Of four new releases this weekend, comedy “50/50” had the best showing in fourth place but still fell short of studio hopes with $8.9 million. The film is a buddy comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Leavitt as a young man with cancer and Seth Rogen as his well-meaning friend. Despite the heavy topic, the movie earned an A- rating from CinemaScore. The film cost about $8 million to produce.   While the cancer theme posed a “challenge,” the film’s makers hope audiences in the coming weeks will focus on the relationship between the friends and how the illness is “handled with humor,” said Richie Fay, president of domestic distribution for Summit Entertainment, which released the film.   In fifth place was drama “Courageous,” a Christian-themed film about four police officers coping with a tragedy. The movie generated $8.8 million, beating studio forecasts of $6 million and more than earning back its production cost of $2 million. It also won an A+ from CinemaScore.   “Dream House,” a new horror film, disappointed with $8.3 million to manage only sixth place for its A-list cast. It stars Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz and James Bond actor Daniel Craig. Critics bashed the movie with only 5 percent surveyed by website Rotten Tomatoes giving a positive review.   Morgan Creek, the studio that produced the film, noted the movie earned a B from audiences polled by CinemaScore.   The weekend’s other new film, adult romantic comedy “What’s Your Number?,” floundered in eighth place with $5.6 million. In the movie, star Anna Faris revisits past relationships to see if any of her ex-boyfriends look more appealing.   Chris Aronson, senior vice president for domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox, said filmgoers gave the movie a B at CinemaScore and the film attracted a majority female crowd, the target audience.   “Dolphin Tale” was released by Warner Bros, a unit of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N).

216,CMCSA,"Controversial ""Playboy Club"" first victim of TV season","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Controversial new drama “The Playboy Club” was axed on Tuesday by NBC after just three episodes, making it the first victim of the new fall TV season.  NBC announced that its new, news magazine show “Rock Center with Brian Williams”, will take the place of the 1960s era show on Monday evening, starting on October 31. New police drama “Prime Suspect” will fill the slot in the meantime.  “The Playboy Club”, set in the early 1960s in the legendary men’s nightclub, centers around the lives of Playboy Bunnies and customers, drew controversy even before it aired.  Leading U.S. feminist Gloria Steinem told Reuters in August that she hoped viewers would boycott the TV series. Steinem, who wrote an expose in the 1960s of the New York City Playboy Club, said the clubs were “the tackiest place on earth”.  The Parents Television Council, which had called it a “degrading and sexualizing program”, said on Tuesday it was pleased at the cancellation.  The small but vociferous TV watchdog took much of the credit for the show’s demise, noting in a statement that it had called on its members and “other concerned citizens to contact local NBC affiliates, and (asked) advertisers whether the Playboy brand aligns with their corporate image.”  Seven advertisers pulled commercials from the second episode although it was not clear whether it was a direct result of the PTC campaign.  But the show, which was produced in conjunction with Hugh Hefner’s Playboy Enterprises, also suffered from weak ratings and generally poor reviews.  Claims in August by producers that the show was empowering for women also ruffled feathers. The Hollywood Reporter in a September review said “The Playboy Club” had “neither the ambition, writing nor acting to make such a comparison (to TV show “Mad Men”) anything more than a chuckle-heavy notion.”  Starring Amber Heard and Eddie Cibrian, it drew just 4.1 million viewers in its third outing on Monday, according to ratings data.  “The Playboy Club” was one of 12 new scripted shows for NBC under its new majority owner, Comcast Corp, in a bid to pull the network up from its long-time bottom place among the four leading U.S. broadcasters.  On a brighter note, NBC announced on Tuesday that it had ordered full seasons of its new comedies “Up All Night”, starring Christina Applegate and Will Arnett, and “Whitney” which is written by, and stars, stand-up comic Whitney Cummings.  “We made comedy an important goal for us this season and I’m very pleased to be making full season commitments to both ‘Whitney’ and ‘Up All Night’,” said NBC entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt.

217,CMCSA,How to Play It: Finding the right channels for investors,"THE ISSUE: The new TV season and watershed events such as the Olympics and the 2012 elections are likely to attract big advertising dollars, focusing investor attention on media and entertainment. What networks will attract the most investor interest, and can internet rivals Google and Yahoo compete?  By Sam Forgione  NEW YORK (Reuters) - While CBS basks in its strong premiere of “Two and a Half Men” and Fox celebrates its hit show “New Girl,” analysts are taking a long-term investment approach to network performance.  Nielsen said that CBS gained the most amount of viewers total in the 2010-2011 season, followed by Fox, ABC, and NBC. These networks have sold most of their advertising time during last spring’s strong upfront sales market.  In total, ad money for broadcast and cable has grown to about $70 billion a year, and may exceed that this season, experts say.  These are strong cues to investors eyeing the entertainment sector. The following experts take a long-term view that favors broad market performance, and one analyst pays special attention to NBC ahead of the 2012 London Olympics, along with local TV stations for their exposure to political advertising ahead of the U.S. elections.  Michael Corty, equity analyst at Morningstar, advises investors not to get glued to this season’s TV hype.  “We are long-term focused. Producing TV hits can be hit or miss, so we don’t put any special weighting on one TV season in contemplating their valuation for their stocks,” he said.  Corty’s top two choices for valuation and quality are Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner.  Disney is trading at roughly $30.50 and 11 times next year’s earnings, and Corty believes that its undervalued status marks a discount.  “With Disney, the success of ESPN is huge, and ratings for football are at an all-time high. They also recently renewed the Monday Night Football rights, which they extended for another eight years,” Corty said. “We think Disney is worth $44, and at $30, there’s an attractive margin of safety for buying the shares at that price.”  Corty likes Time Warner — which includes CNN, TBS and HBO — since it is trading at 10 times earnings and has a healthy exposure to cable networks. It also has a wide influence on other broadcasters.  “What is often overlooked is that Time Warner produces and sells a lot of new shows. Warner Bros. is selling TV shows into all the broadcast companies.”  As a pure-cable play, Corty recommends Discovery.  “We think Discovery is worth $45 and it’s trading at $36. We like it more for its international growth. It has solid domestic growth, but has a lot more room for international growth than pay TV.”  Investors should keep their sights on NBC and local networks in time for the Olympics and the elections, both of which are game-changing events for advertising.  “NBC will benefit from the Olympics, and political advertisers will favor local TV stations, not networks,” said Michael Kupinski, managing director of media and entertainment at Noble Financial.  Kupinski argues that, while new sitcoms affect ad money, “local ratings tend to be more stable,” and the Olympics and elections set the stage for those stations’ highest performance until the year’s end.  “With regard to the strongest broadcast operation, there’s Gannett. I think it will get a lift and bring total company revenues up next year. Other pure broadcasters are Sinclair, Nexstar, and Lin TV,” Kupinski said.  Kupinski also mentioned Entravision Communications as a political advertising hotbed for its core audience of Hispanic voters, and Belo Corp. and EW Scripps as TV plays.  Kupinski says that the local element explains the deceleration of highflyers Google and Yahoo, which compete with TV for ads.  “In order for companies like Google and Yahoo to accelerate, they need to move to a local level. The market typically has not differentiated between organic and acquisition growth, and in order to move out that range, they need to step up acquisition.”  Two analysts said they are also bullish on TV.  “All the networks, cable as well, had good upfront in the vicinity of $9 billion, and it’s based on a bullish ad-sales marketplace,” said Brad Adgate, senior VP of research for Horizon Media. Brett Harriss of Gabelli and Co. agreed: “There are buys across media,” he said, picking News Corp. as his favorite.  Harris sees past the phone hacking scandal that has embroiled Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp empire, and still considers it a buy.  “News Corp. is an inexpensive, good company that is buying back a lot of shares.

What networks will attract the most investor interest, and can internet rivals Google and Yahoo compete?   By Sam Forgione   NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - While CBS basks in its strong premiere of “Two and a Half Men” and Fox celebrates its hit show “New Girl,” analysts are taking a long-term investment approach to network performance.   Nielsen said that CBS gained the most amount of viewers total in the 2010-2011 season, followed by Fox, ABC, and NBC. These networks have sold most of their advertising time during last spring’s strong upfront sales market.   In total, ad money for broadcast and cable has grown to about $70 billion a year, and may exceed that this season, experts say.   These are strong cues to investors eyeing the entertainment sector. The following experts take a long-term view that favors broad market performance, and one analyst pays special attention to NBC ahead of the 2012 London Olympics, along with local TV stations for their exposure to political advertising ahead of the U.S. elections.   Michael Corty, equity analyst at Morningstar, advises investors not to get glued to this season’s TV hype.   “We are long-term focused. Producing TV hits can be hit or miss, so we don’t put any special weighting on one TV season in contemplating their valuation for their stocks,” he said.   Corty’s top two choices for valuation and quality are Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Time Warner (TWX).   Disney is trading at roughly $30.50 and 11 times next year’s earnings, and Corty believes that its undervalued status marks a discount.   “With Disney, the success of ESPN is huge, and ratings for football are at an all-time high. They also recently renewed the Monday Night Football rights, which they extended for another eight years,” Corty said. “We think Disney is worth $44, and at $30, there’s an attractive margin of safety for buying the shares at that price.”   Corty likes Time Warner — which includes CNN, TBS and HBO — since it is trading at 10 times earnings and has a healthy exposure to cable networks. It also has a wide influence on other broadcasters.   “What is often overlooked is that Time Warner produces and sells a lot of new shows. Warner Bros. is selling TV shows into all the broadcast companies.”   As a pure-cable play, Corty recommends Discovery (DISCA.O).   “We think Discovery is worth $45 and it’s trading at $36. We like it more for its international growth. It has solid domestic growth, but has a lot more room for international growth than pay TV.”   Investors should keep their sights on NBC and local networks in time for the Olympics and the elections, both of which are game-changing events for advertising.   “NBC (CMCSA.O) will benefit from the Olympics, and political advertisers will favor local TV stations, not networks,” said Michael Kupinski, managing director of media and entertainment at Noble Financial.   Kupinski argues that, while new sitcoms affect ad money, “local ratings tend to be more stable,” and the Olympics and elections set the stage for those stations’ highest performance until the year’s end.   “With regard to the strongest broadcast operation, there’s Gannett (GCI.N). I think it will get a lift and bring total company revenues up next year. Other pure broadcasters are Sinclair (SBGI.O), Nexstar (NXST.O), and Lin TV TVL.N,” Kupinski said.   Kupinski also mentioned Entravision Communications (EVC) as a political advertising hotbed for its core audience of Hispanic voters, and Belo Corp.BLC.N and EW Scripps (SSP.N) as TV plays.   Kupinski says that the local element explains the decelaration of highflyers Google (GOOG.O) and Yahoo YHOO.O, which compete with TV for ads.   “In order for companies like Google and Yahoo to accelerate, they need to move to a local level.The market typically has not differentiated between organic and acquisition growth, and in order to move out that range, they need to step up acquisition.”   Two analysts said they are also bullish on TV.   “All the networks, cable as well, had good upfront in the vicinity of $9 billion, and it’s based on a bullish ad-sales marketplace,” said Brad Adgate, senior VP of research for Horizon Media. Brett Harriss of Gabelli and Co. agreed: “There are buys across media,” he said, picking News Corp.(NWSA.O) as his favorite.   Harris sees past the phone hacking scandal that has embroiled Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp empire, and still considers it a buy.   “News Corp. is an inexpensive, good company that is buying back a lot of shares. It also trades at five times last year’s EBITDA.”   Adgate finds it tough to choose between the overarching earnings of both CBS (CBS) and Fox, which is owned by News Corp.   “Fox has been effective in targeting the 18-49 age group and received $2 billion up front, whereas CBS has generated the most viewers for the past 7 or 8 years.”  ",10042011,http://www.reuters.com/article/tv-play/corrected-how-to-play-it-finding-the-right-channels-for-investors-idUSS1E78S1N820111004
219,CMCSA,Microsoft reaches 40 content deals for Xbox,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has struck more than 40 deals with TV and entertainment companies, making it possible for owners of its Xbox gaming console who are also paying cable subscribers to watch live television through the devices.  The greatly expanded range of TV content on the gaming device effectively makes the Xbox a cable TV set-top box, but stops short of speculation that Microsoft would encourage Xbox owners to drop their pay-TV subscriptions.  Several major technology companies including Microsoft, Google (GOOG.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), have been in long negotiations with the programmers and Hollywood to see if they can provide so-called ‘over-the-top’ online video services which could rival traditional cable television. The programmers have so far successfully resisted any attempt to unravel the $100 billion a year relationship between programmers and pay-TV distributors.  The new Xbox deals announced on Wednesday are part of the technology giant’s bid to make its gaming console a major media hub in the living room and took years to sort out, said Ross Honey, general manager of content acquisition for the interactive entertainment business at Microsoft.  In the U.S., services from Time Warner (TWX.N)-owned HBO, Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications’ (VZ.N) FiOs will be available on the Xbox while other large deals in other countries include Televisa in Mexico and the BBC in the UK.

221,CMCSA,U.S. FCC draws tough court for Web rule lawsuits," * Court consolidates challenges to D.C. appeals court   * D.C. circuit seen toughest for FCC   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Challenges to new U.S. Internet traffic rules will be heard in the federal appeals court in Washington D.C., a court that has previously been skeptical of the Federal Communications Commission’s authority.   A judicial panel that manages multidistrict litigation   said on Thursday it had randomly selected the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to hear appeals of the FCC’s “Open Internet” order.   The same appeals court ruled last year that the FCC lacked the authority to stop Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) from blocking bandwidth-hogging applications on its broadband network, spurring the agency’s rulemaking.   “The FCC is in for a rough legal battle given the past history of net neutrality in the D.C. circuit,” said Medley Global Advisors analyst Jeffrey Silva.   The FCC has repeatedly expressed confidence in the legal foundation backing the rules which are due to take effect Nov. 20. “The FCC stands ready to defend its open Internet order in any court of appeals,” an agency spokesman said on Thursday.   Adopted by a divided FCC last December, the Internet rules seek to balance the interests of consumers and content providers with those who sell access to the Web and often supply their own content.   The rules forbid broadband providers from blocking legal content while leaving flexibility for providers to manage their networks.   Backers of net neutrality rules say big providers could otherwise use their gatekeeper role to discriminate against competitors. Internet providers say they need to be able to manage their networks for all users.   Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) filed suit last week, asking the D.C. appeals court to have the rules thrown out, saying the FCC was “arbitrary” and “capricious” and acted beyond its statutory authority in imposing the rules. [ID:nS1E78T1P1]   Public interest groups have criticized the rules as too weak, saying the FCC was swayed by big industry players including AT&T Inc (T.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).   Free Press filed suit last week in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, challenging provisions in the order that give wireless broadband providers more discretion in managing their networks. [ID:nS1E78R1KX]   Other suits were also filed in the second, third, fourth and ninth circuits.

Hulu’s owners, which also include News Corp , Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and Providence Equity, said in a statement on Thursday they had decided against a sale of the video service. “Our focus now rests solely on ensuring that our efforts as owners contribute in a meaningful way to the exciting future that lies ahead for Hulu,” they said in a statement. Reuters reported last month that the auction was in danger of getting derailed by conflicts over convoluted digital rights, a wide bid-ask gap, and a lack of commitment to sell by Hulu’s owners, among other things. This was the second time Hulu’s owners had envisioned a full or partial exit strategy that failed. After nearly six months of planning, they ditched an initial public offering last December that might have raised up to $300 million. Sources with knowledge of the talks said last month a rift had developed between the price bidders offered and the amount that Hulu’s owners were willing to accept. Bids had ranged from as low as $500 million to as much as $2 billion, the sources said at the time. The most serious suitors included Google Inc , Amazon.com Inc , DirecTV and DISH Network Corp . Yahoo Inc had been viewed as one of the most enthusiastic bidders — before its leadership imploded with the abrupt firing of CEO Carol Bartz. Hulu’s owners had always faced an uphill battle in valuing a nascent Web content-streaming service with no long-term content deals and with unclear digital rights for newer Internet or mobile platforms for which there exists no established model. Some analysts had thought an outright sale to be an abandonment of Hulu’s future growth potential, particularly if, as some experts say, Internet streaming will become mainstream in coming years.",10142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/hulu/update-2-hulu-sale-called-off-after-months-of-talks-idUSL3E7LD3MS20111014
227,CMCSA,Baseball eyes new $1B TV contract in off-season,"* TV deals eyed as baseball heads into off-season * ESPN, Fox, TBS lead strong competition for contracts * Comcast and CBS could jump into the fray * Current deals expire after 2013 season By Paul Thomasch Oct 31 (Reuters) - The Major League Baseball season just ended, but the league is already weighing plans for a new television contract potentially worth more than $1 billion. MLB’s current deals with ESPN, Fox and TBS expire after the 2013 season, and sources said all three networks are likely to be involved in the next round of negotiations, which are expected to begin this off-season. These people said NBC Universal and CBS are also interested in joining the talks. The dramatic climax to this season’s World Series between the Texas Rangers and St. Louis Cardinals, coupled with the intense demand among networks for programming viewers watch live, should give MLB strong negotiating leverage in the next round of talks. Ratings for this year’s World Series, broadcast on Fox, were hardly blockbuster but still averaged 16.6 million viewers, up about 19 percent from last year, driven by a Game Six extra-inning comeback victory for the Cardinals that stoked interest in the team’s Game 7 victory last week. Analysts expect the price of a new deal to increase by 10 percent or more from the league’s current contracts, which are estimated to be worth around $900 million annually. The interest in baseball in not due to the World Series alone, however, as advertisers exhibited a strong appetite for commercial time throughout baseball’s lengthy 182-game regular season and two rounds of league playoff series. “No doubt baseball is going to be a product of interest,” said sports TV consultant Mike Tracer, a former NBC Sports vice president. “If you are a rights holder, you want to get these negotiations done as early as you can — it would seem to be an advantage,” said Tracer. “The result is there is a lot of aggressive posturing right now between the networks.” The ultimate price for the league’s new television contract depends in part on deals struck in other sports, most notably the National Football League. The NFL, the most popular sport in terms of television ratings, also has contracts coming up for renewal, and recently won a 73 percent price hike from Walt Disney Co’s ESPN to extend a deal for “Monday Night Football,” the Pro Bowl and the NFL draft through 2021. As for baseball, an ESPN representative said, “We have a 22-year relationship with Major League Baseball and look forward to continuing it.” A representative for News Corp’s Fox said, “Fox Sports has had a mutually beneficial relationship with Major League Baseball both as a national and local rights holder for many years, and we plan to do our best to continue those relationships well into the future.” The wildcard in the next round of talks is Comcast Corp. , the new majority owner of NBC Universal. Comcast officials have made no secret of their desire to ramp up sports coverage, and a deal with baseball would allow the company to spread out games across the NBC Network, Versus, and even its cable outlets such as USA. “We’re always interested in strong properties,” said an NBC Sports spokesman. The caveat, however, is that “Sunday Night Football” is NBC’s highest rated program, and carrying the baseball playoffs or World Series would likely create a scheduling conflict. NBC also may not want to interrupt its fall programming as it tries to revive its prime-time schedule. Taken together, those two factors could limit how aggressively Comcast pursues a TV deal the with MLB. CBS Corp , which declined to comment, could also jump into the fray. Some have speculated that it could partner with Time Warner Inc’s Turner Sports to make a joint bid for baseball — as it has done with the NCAA basketball championship — but sources familiar with the situation said that combination was highly unlikely. The source said Turner is more likely to pursue a renewal of its TBS current deal, which gives it rights a Sunday game as well as the league playoffs, rather than trying to work out all new agreements with another network.",10312011,http://www.reuters.com/article/baseball-television/baseball-eyes-new-1b-tv-contract-in-off-season-idUSN1E79U1OJ20111031
228,CMCSA,"Cable TV drives results at Time Warner, Comcast","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp and Time Warner Inc reported stronger quarterly results on Wednesday, confirming that it pays to have a solid lineup of cable networks — at least while advertisers keep spending. Against all odds, advertisers continue to scoop up commercial time on television, and cable networks including Time Warner’s TNT and Comcast’s USA have been major beneficiaries. Subscription fees have only helped. That point was driven home on Wednesday when Time Warner reported revenue from its cable networks rose 7 percent. Comcast, whose cable business is run through its majority interest in NBC Universal, posted a 12 percent increase. “Cable networks drive the profitability of NBC Universal and they continue to perform well,” said Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts, who has staked his reputation on last year’s $30 billion deal for NBCU. Comcast’s cable network results stand out even more compared with the performance of its flagship broadcast TV network NBC, whose prime-time schedule has struggled for years. Already NBC has canceled two shows it just rolled out for the new TV season, “Playboy Club” and “Free Agents.” “The cable networks like USA are firing on all cylinders. Unfortunately, the public face of NBC Universal is the broadcast network, and that is just struggling,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett. At Time Warner, where CEO Jeff Bewkes wants to focus the company squarely on creating content for TV, movies and magazines, advertising sales climbed 6 percent. It cited strong pricing at its Turner networks, home to original shows such as “The Closer,” the late-night talk show host Conan O’Brien, news on CNN and sports including basketball and auto racing. Bewkes also continued to champion TV Everywhere, an initiative to bring more TV shows online for paying cable subscribers, especially those who subscribe to HBO and other premium channels. HBO Go, the mobile version of the channel, has reached so-called authentication deals with most major carriers except Time Warner Cable Inc and Cablevision Systems Corp to date. “We have made a lot of progress with the two major affiliates who don’t yet have authentication agreements. I’m hopeful for their sake they will be up and running in the next few months,” Bewkes said on a call with analysts. Overall, Time Warner Inc’s adjusted earnings rose a better-than-expected 27 percent to 79 cents a share despite a dip in adjusted operating profit at its cable networks. That dip caused Time Warner Inc’s shares to fall as much as 3.7 percent on Wednesday. “Although we appreciate this concern, we view this as a slight over-reaction given the 7 percent growth at the cable networks and the strong, 18 percent overall adjusted operating income growth,” said Collins Stewart analyst Thomas Eagan. Time Warner also raised its full-year outlook for earnings per share growth to “high teens” percentage points from “at least low teens”. Along with its cable business, the company got a big lift from the latest installment of the Harry Potter movie series. It is not just Comcast and Time Warner whose results are enjoying the one-two punch of cable advertising and cable subscription fees. Discovery Communications Inc, the company behind hit cable TV shows “Storm Chasers” and “Deadliest Catch,” reported quarterly results late Tuesday that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Next up is News Corp, whose cable networks should emerge from the long shadow cast by its troubled newspaper arm when it reports earnings later on Wednesday. Walt Disney Co, with some of the best cable brands in the business, including ESPN, reports next week. Today’s stubbornly bad jobs and housing markets — coupled with Europe’s debt crisis — would seem the sort of troubles that would have advertisers once more slashing budgets. Advertisers instead appear to be betting that the best way to jump-start sales is to keep their brands in front of consumers with billboards, digital campaigns and, particularly, TV commercials. Heading into Wednesday, the economy was a major question facing media companies, particularly Comcast. Not only does Comcast rely on advertising from its TV networks, but its chief business of selling broadband, video and telephone services relies heavily on the housing market and consumer confidence. Overall, it added 229,000 telephone, video and Internet customers. That satisfied Wall Street and calmed worries that arose last week when Time Warner Cable and Cablevision Systems posted disappointing subscriber numbers. Comcast reported third-quarter net income of $908 million, or 33 cents a share, up from $867 million, or 31 cents a share, in the period a year ago.

Walt Disney Co., with some of the best cable brands in the business, including ESPN, reports next week. To many observers, the continued strength of national advertising comes as a surprise. Just two years ago, in reaction to the recession, overall U.S. ad spending dropped by percent to $163 billion.

231,CMCSA,"UPDATE 3-Comcast profit rises, overcomes NBC drag","* Revenue up 5 percent to $14.3 billion * Adds 261,000 Internet customers, more than expected * NBC broadcast advertising flat, cable up * Shares up 1.6 pct By Paul Thomasch Nov 2 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s profit rose 5 percent thanks to healthy results from its cable business, calming recent worries that the industry was succumbing to pressures from a weak economy and poor housing market. Comcast relied on its cable business to offset a weak quarter from two of its newer media properties, the NBC television network and Universal Pictures. “Unfortunately, the public face of NBC Universal is the broadcast network and that is just struggling,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein. “The turnaround of a television network doesn’t happen overnight. They are showing a lot of resolve but it is not an easy challenge.” The largest U.S. cable operator, and majority owner of NBC Universal, reported third-quarter net income on Wednesday of $908 million, or 33 cents a share, up from $867 million, or 31 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Analysts expected Comcast to report earnings of 40 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Comcast blamed part of the shortfall on swings in its investment income from quarter to quarter. Revenue rose about 5 percent to $14.3 billion. While Comcast lost basic video customers, it slowed the bleeding during the quarter, losing 165,000 customers compared to a 275,000 in the period a year ago. It also added a better-than-expected 261,000 Internet subscribers. Overall, it added 229,000 telephone, video and Internet customers, which calmed worries that arose last week when Time Warner Cable and Cablevision Systems Corp , two rivals, posted disappointing subscriber numbers. While cable companies have been losing customers to phone companies such as Verizon Communications , a more immediate worry has been the economy. Without jobs, people are far less likely to pay up for premium cable packages; and if they aren’t moving into new homes, they aren’t signing up for new services. Cablevision’s earnings report sent its shares plunging as much as 16 percent on Friday and dragged down other stocks in the sector, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Dish Network and DirecTV . “In the context of relatively weak results from Time Warner and Cablevision last week, these results were a welcome relief,” Moffett said of Comcast’s numbers. Revenue from Comcast’s cable business climbed 5 percent. NBC Universal also posted higher revenue, but the cost of investing in the media division hurt its profit. The NBC broadcast network, which Comcast has said is a long-term turnaround project, posted a operating cash flow loss of $7 million. And its Universal Pictures movie division saw its profit drop by 17 percent. Comcast shares crept up 1.6 percent to $23.35 in light premarket trading.",11022011,http://www.reuters.com/article/comcast/update-3-comcast-profit-rises-overcomes-nbc-drag-idUSN1E7A01IT20111102
232,CMCSA,"Losing in fall ratings, NBC says the race is long","NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - NBC is having a rough fall. The network is down 11 percent in the ratings, while its rival networks gain or hold steady. It is the only network already to have canceled two shows this season. And according to Comcast earnings released Wednesday, its third-quarter ad revenue was flat. Which would make this feel like panic time — if NBC’s strategy mostly depended on fall. But the network insists that it does not. More than any other network, NBC has tried to program year-round, like cable networks do, rather than emphasize fall. It may seem like a case of changing the rules when you’re losing the game, but the strategy is helping the fourth-place network eke out niche victories at times when other networks expend far less effort. “Remember this is a company that not that long ago was willing to stick Jay Leno in a roadblock at 10 o’clock five nights a week,” said Craig Moffett, a senior analyst for Bernstein Research. “That was as close as a sign of capitulation as you’re gonna get. Comcast is still trying to undo the damage that was done during a long period of under-investment.” NBC executives declined to comment for this story. Though NBC represents only about 6 percent of Comcast’s revenue, it is one of its most prominent assets, Moffett said. That means Comcast has “staked its reputation on being able to fix what’s broken at NBC.” Comcast, which acquired the network in January, announced in May that it would dedicate $200 million to programing costs to help turn the network around. It brought in respected creative executive Robert Greenblatt to head NBC Entertainment when it took control of the company. This development season, the network has outbid other networks for high-profile projects including a comedy from “Glee” co-creator Ryan Murphy and writer Allison Adler, and the weight-loss sitcom “Big Men,” from “Bridesmaids” star Chris O’Dowd. NBC has also had consistent success with “Sunday Night Football,” and will air this season’s Super Bowl, which has grown to record viewership in each of its past two years. The network also points to its relatively youthful viewership — the median age is 48.9, lower than that of ABC or CBS’s audience. And it boasts that its audience has surpassed ABC’s as the most upscale, with a higher index of 18-to-49-year-olds who live in homes with earnings of $100,000 or more. It has wisely refused to set a timeline for surpassing third-place ABC, which has remained flat in the fall ratings as NBC slipped. This fall, NBC’s early casualties have included the drama “The Playboy Club” and the comedy “Free Agents.” No other network has canceled two shows this season; only Fox, which is surging in viewership and ratings, has not canceled any. Greenblatt inherited almost all of the current season’s slate when he took over earlier this year with Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal. Though he didn’t get to develop his shows from their beginnings, he does get to decide where to put them. His biggest success has been “The Voice,” which debuted in April and became the biggest new show of last season. This season, it will debut after the Super Bowl in February, and then provide a lead-in for “Smash.” Greenblatt has high hopes for the musical drama, which he began developing at Showtime before he moved over to NBC. “The Voice” was NBC’s first niche win during Greenblatt’s term, but not its last: the network was the top-ranked of the summer, thanks in large part to the strength of “America’s Got Talent.” NBC also had a promising night this past Friday. Its fairy-tale inspired cop show, “Grimm,” debuted to a solid 2.1 last week in the 18-to-49 demographic. That’s far from a great number, but it’s a good one for the Friday-night ratings dead zone. NBC’s greatest challenge is to build on its niche successes. If “The Voice” and “Smash” can succeed back-to-back on Monday nights, it would create a new musical-themed block for a network eager for built-in successes during the week. But NBC hasn’t had the best luck turning niche successes into primetime smashes so far. “NBC Nightly News” anchor Brian Williams is one of the networks’ greatest assets — a utility player who not only leads the highest-rated nightly newscast, but knows how to turn on the comedy for “Saturday Night Live” appearances. His new primetime show, “Rock Center with Brian Williams,” debuted to an anemic 1.0 rating on Halloween night — earning even weaker ratings than “The Playboy Club,” which it replaced in the 10 p.m. timeslot. In defense of “Rock Center,” news shows are cheaper to produce than dramas, and need lower ratings to justify themselves. Also, Halloween is a bad night for television viewing all around. A person at NBCU-Universal said the show’s “ratings were totally in line with our expectations and we’re committed to the show.” Sounds like another long-term strategy.",11032011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nbc/losing-in-fall-ratings-nbc-says-the-race-is-long-idUSTRE7A24YW20111103
233,CMCSA,Cable TV ups profits at big media companies,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp, News Corp and Time Warner Inc reported stronger quarterly results on Wednesday, confirming it pays to have a solid lineup of cable networks — at least while advertisers keep spending. Against all odds, advertisers continue to scoop up commercial time on television, and cable networks including Time Warner’s TNT, News Corp’s FX and Comcast’s USA have been major beneficiaries. Subscription fees have only helped. That point was driven home on Wednesday when Time Warner reported revenue from its cable networks rose 7 percent. Comcast, whose cable business is run through its majority interest in NBC Universal, posted a 12 percent increase. ""Cable networks drive the profitability of NBC Universal and they continue to perform well,"" said Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts, who has staked his reputation on last year's $30 billion deal for NBCU. (For a graphic of media companies' market cap: r.reuters.com/vyj74s ) Comcast’s cable network results stand out even more compared with the performance of its flagship broadcast TV network NBC, whose prime-time schedule has struggled for years. Already NBC has canceled two shows it just rolled out for the new TV season, “Playboy Club” and “Free Agents.” “The cable networks like USA are firing on all cylinders. Unfortunately, the public face of NBC Universal is the broadcast network, and that is just struggling,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett. At Time Warner, where CEO Jeff Bewkes wants to focus the company squarely on creating content for TV, movies and magazines, advertising sales climbed 6 percent. It cited strong pricing at its Turner networks, home to original shows such as “The Closer” and to the late-night talk show host Conan O’Brien, news on CNN and sports including baseball and auto racing. Overall, Time Warner Inc’s adjusted earnings rose a better-than-expected 27 percent to 79 cents a share despite a dip in adjusted operating profit at its cable networks. That dip caused Time Warner Inc’s shares to fall as much as 3.7 percent on Wednesday. “Although we appreciate this concern, we view this as a slight over-reaction given the 7 percent growth at the cable networks and the strong, 18 percent overall adjusted operating income growth,” said Collins Stewart analyst Thomas Eagan. Time Warner also raised its full-year outlook for earnings per share growth to “high teens” percentage points from “at least low teens”. Along with its cable business, the company got a big lift from the latest installment of the Harry Potter movie series. Operating profits at News Corp’s cable networks jumped some 18 percent, helped by strong affiliate fee revenue from cable and satellite TV distributors. News Corp also reiterated its previously given fiscal year 2012 outlook for operating income growth of low to mid teens. It is not just Comcast and Time Warner whose results are enjoying the one-two punch of cable advertising and cable subscription fees. Discovery Communications Inc, the company behind hit cable TV shows “Storm Chasers” and “Deadliest Catch,” reported quarterly results late Tuesday that surpassed Wall Street expectations.

Angelakis signed a new employment agreement on Nov. 22 that will keep him at the company through June 30, 2016, but he will not be joining the board. While the new agreement does not increase Angelakis’ base salary or his annual cash bonus opportunity, he will be entitled to receive two cash signing bonuses totaling $4.25 million on or after Jan. 1, according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2010, he received a total compensation package of $22.9 million. Angelakis will continue to report to Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts. Angelakis, who joined Comcast from Providence Equity Partners in 2007, was instrumental in hashing out the terms of Comcast’s complicated takeover of NBC Universal from General Electric Co last year. Since the deal closed, Comcast has restructured its senior management team to take account of its increased complexity. Former Comcast Chief Operating Officer Steve Burke took over as CEO of NBC Universal, and former Charter Communications CEO Neil Smit joined to run Comcast’s cable operations. A person close to the company said Angelakis had taken on expanded responsibilities since the acquisition of NBC Universal to help Roberts with running the overall corporate business.

237,CMCSA,"Verizon to buy cable spectrum, pressuring rivals","(Reuters) - Verizon Wireless will pay top U.S. cable providers $3.6 billion for wireless airwaves and let them resell its mobile service, heating up competition with the wireless company’s chief rivals. The agreement, with a consortium that includes Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc, puts new pressure on Verizon rivals Sprint Nextel and  AT&T;, which is tied up fighting regulatory opposition to its proposed T-Mobile USA acquisition. Both Verizon Wireless and AT&T;, the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. mobile providers, have made no secret of the fact that they need more spectrum to support increased consumer demand for videos and other data-heavy services. As a result Verizon’s purchase could add urgency for AT&T; and T-Mobile USA to close their deal, according to Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett, who called the Verizon Wireless deal a “masterstroke.” “If approved, the spectrum sale represents a dramatic reordering of the wireless landscape,” said Moffett who had previously speculated that T-Mobile USA could team up with cable providers if the AT&T; deal failed. Another analyst saw the development of a reseller deal with Verizon Wireless as a strategic about-face by the cable operators, which compete with Verizon and AT&T; in home telephone, Internet and television services. “The biggest surprise is that it aligns the cable companies with Verizon, one of their fiercest competitors,” said Mizuho analyst Michael Nelson. “The primary reason the cable companies formed this consortium and acquired this spectrum was to compete better with Verizon and AT&T.;” The cable industry has tried unsuccessfully in the last decade to sell wireless services to customers including faltering partnerships with Sprint and more recently with Clearwire Corp. Some insiders see this deal as an admission of failure by cable industry even as it dominates growth in Internet services and wireline phones, previously controlled by traditional telephone companies. Some investors had worried the operators would spend billions of dollars building their own wireless networks. “(This) gets us into the market very efficiently,” said Neil Smit, president of Comcast Cable. However, the resale deal could be seen as an about-face. As recently as October, Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Glenn Britt said the company hadn’t found “anything wonderful” about the idea of reselling other operators’ capacity. Some analysts had expected the cable operators to keep the assets longer in the hope of getting a better price, particularly if the AT&T; deal with T-Mobile USA failed. Comcast said, however, that the deal represented a 64 percent premium over the $2.2 billion price the consortium paid in 2006 for the spectrum being sold to Verizon Wireless. The cable operators already resell wireless services using the network of Clearwire Corp, their venture with No. 3 U.S. mobile service Sprint Nextel. Comcast, which has a 9 percent stake in Clearwire, said it would move 30,000 customers off the Clearwire network over the next six months. Comcast Cable’s Smit declined to comment on what the company will do with its 9 percent interest in Clearwire, but one analyst said it would likely shed the stake. “This deal means the cable industry will almost certainly have to exit the Clearwire venture, and raises troubling questions about whether Sprint will have to take on additional equity in the venture,” said Moffett. On Thursday, the money-losing Sprint said it had committed to a $347 million equity investment in Clearwire. Sprint had to shore up its balance sheet with a recent $4 billion debt offering and needs to raise up to $3 billion more. Analysts said they expect the deal to be approved by U.S. government regulators, after a review. While some analysts had hoped the cable operators would stick with Clearwire, Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Chaplin said the deal may push up the value of Clearwire’s spectrum, particularly if the AT&T;’s deal with T-Mobile USA founders. “This limits the supply of spectrum available to all those carriers that have been more vocal about needing spectrum, which should drive up the value for other sources of spectrum,” Chaplin said. The cable companies and Verizon Wireless also said they have formed a joint venture aimed at integrating services, including potentially creating new mobile video applications. The venture will be 50 percent owned by the cable companies and 50 percent by Verizon Wireless. Comcast, owner of 63.6 percent of the venture that is selling the spectrum, SpectrumCo LLC, will receive about $2.3 billion from the sale. Time Warner Cable, a 31.2 percent owner of the venture, will get about $1.1 billion. Privately held Bright House Networks, a 5.3 percent owner, will receive $189 million.

Roberts violated the notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, between October 22, 2007 and April 2009 by receiving Comcast voting securities without filing notification to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, according to the complaint. According to the complaint, Roberts failed to notify regulators before acquiring voting securities of Comcast as part of his compensation beginning in October 2007. This resulted in his holding around $120 million of Comcast stock. The HSR Act of 1976 requires that executives and companies over a certain size observe waiting periods and notify regulators before they buy stock or assets above a certain value, which was $59.8 million in 2007 and is currently $66 million. Roberts’ total compensation in 2010 was just over $31 million. He controls one-third of Comcast’s voting stock and owns less than 2 percent of the company’s equity, according to a company filing.

The agreement covers Disney’s various networks including ABC and ESPN, and will allow Comcast’s Xfinity TV customers to watch those networks live or on-demand on multiple devices. The deal gives a big boost to the cable TV industry’s push for programmers and distributors to reach agreements that will enable paying subscribers to watch their favorite shows anytime.

Comcast will also provide its Xfinity customers with access to live Disney networks.

Shares were up 5 percent in morning trading on Wednesday, hitting a new 52-week high, as the company also announced a 44 percent increase in its quarterly dividend and a new $6.5 billion share buyback. The leading U.S. cable TV provider added 336,000 Internet subscribers and lost just 17,000 video customers — its best quarterly video numbers in five years. Analysts at Collins Stewart had expected Comcast to add 242,000 Internet subscribers and lose as many as 140,000 video subscribers. “I really believe these improvements are sustainable because they are the result of our scale and our intensified focus on service and innovation,” said Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts on a conference call with analysts. U.S. cable companies have been losing traditional video subscribers at an increasing rate over the last five years and have been relying mainly on Internet and phone additions for subscriber growth. The cable industry has been hit by a triple whammy of a weak housing market, stiffer competition from satellite TV and phone companies and cheaper entertainment alternatives from Web video services like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). Cable executives have disputed that they are losing customers to online video services in a phenomenon known as “cord-cutting,” which is expected to see new entrants from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O). Comcast and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N have led a push to expand their programming agreements to include Web access so customers can see their shows wherever they are, and on most devices. “We may not get back to full growth in video for a while because we don’t see housing growth, but someday that’s going to happen,” said Roberts. Comcast also added 146,000 phone customers, below Collins Stewart’s forecast of 170,000 additions. “I thought these were pretty strong results,” said Collins Stewart analyst Thomas Eagan. “They could possibly grow video subscribers in the current quarter. We think this reflects better overall execution across the cable business.” Comcast, which took control of NBC Universal a year ago, said strong cash flow growth at its cable networks was offset by a weaker performance at the NBC broadcast business and its Universal studio. Cable networks, including USA, Bravo and E!, saw operating cash flow jump 16.2 percent to $930 million, but NBC cash flow turned negative at $52 million. Universal’s operating cash flow nearly halved to $91 million. The theme park business posted flat operating cash flow performance at $191 million. Comcast is doing well in spite of NBC Universal’s weaker performance, said Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett in a note to clients. “Comcast remains a distribution company, not a media company, and by a huge margin. NBCU, in other words, just needs to stay out of the way.” Fourth-quarter net income rose to $1.29 billion, or 47 cents a share from $1.02 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year before. Analysts had on average forecast profit of 41 cents per share, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3 percent to $15 billion. The cable company raised its dividend by 44 percent to 16.25 cents a quarter, or 65 cents a year, and announced a new share buyback program of $6.5 billion, with a pledge to spend $3 billion in 2012. Analysts said they had been expecting Comcast to buy back around $3.5 billion in stock in 2012. Comcast is the latest media company to announce a major buyback and dividend increase at the start of the year. Viacom Inc (VIAB.O), Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) all have put more focus on returning cash to shareholders for 2012 rather than on major acquisitions or capital intensive projects. Comcast shares rose by $1.36 to $28.61 in late-morning trade on Nasdaq. ",2152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast/comcast-profit-beats-street-on-subscriber-gains-idUSTRE81E0RN20120215

247,CMCSA,Comcast to take on Netflix with Web video service,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the No. 1 U.S. cable operator, became the latest major name to take on Netflix Inc on Tuesday when it announced plans for an online video service offering a library of TV shows and movies. The new service, called Xfinity Streampix, will be made available only to Comcast’s cable TV subscribers. But the service could also operate as a standalone service outside of the cable subscription package under programming agreements it has with some of the partners that supply it with shows and movies, according to a person familiar with the plan. Comcast executive Marcien Jenckes said the company has no plans to launch a standalone service and will instead complement the 75,000 TV shows and movies already available on-demand via customers’ cable boxes. Streampix will come free with Comcast’s top video packages and for an extra $4.99 a month in lower tiers. Comcast is launching Streampix with TV shows and movies from partners including Walt Disney Co, Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros, Sony Pictures and NBC Universal, which it owns. Plans for Streampix come just weeks after Verizon Communications said it would create a joint venture with Coinstar Inc’s Redbox to offer online video and DVD rentals separate to its FiOS service. Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc are also working on plans to launch their own online video services. Netflix has built a subscriber base of some 24 million subscribers by offering a package of older TV shows and movies, and investors in cable TV fear that customers will start dropping the more expensive TV packages in favor of Netflix. Comcast already offers millions of hours a month of on-demand video through its cable boxes but online video allows additional flexibility. For instance, it can offer entire seasons of popular TV series like “30 Rock” and “Grey’s Anatomy” - a feature that has been popular with Netflix users. “There’s clearly a lot of demand for library content like favorite TV services,” said Jenckes. “We’ve seen other companies launch very successful products in this space and we recognize this is something the marketplace wants.” ",2212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-onlinevideo/comcast-to-take-on-netflix-with-web-video-service-idUSTRE81K23V20120221

249,CMCSA,Comcast launching 4 new minority-owned networks,"* ‘Magic’ Johnson, Sean Combs to launch networks * Move results with Comcast deal on NBC Universal purchase * 10 networks to be launched over next eight years Feb 21 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the leading U.S. cable company, is launching four new minority-owned cable networks with partners including former basketball star Earvin “Magic” Johnson, hip-hop mogul Sean Diddy Combs and Hollywood director Robert Rodriguez. The new networks come out of Comcast’s agreement with regulators to create 10 new independently owned cable networks for minority populations in exchange for clearance of its acquisition of a controlling stake in NBC Universal. As a result, four of the networks be majority African-American owned, two will be majority American Latino owned, two will be operated by American Latino programmers and two will provide additional independent programming. Comcast hopes to have the networks all launched over the next eight years. Magic Johnson will partner with GMC TV to launch a network called Aspire aimed at African-American families with a mix of movies, documentaries and comedy among its programming formats. The channel is planned for this summer. Combs’ channel, Revolt, and MTV veteran Andy Schuon will focus on music and is planned for launch in 2013. Combs has also been in talks with other networks including Time Warner Cable Inc, the second-largest U.S. cable operator. Rodriguez in partnership with FactoryMade Ventures has proposed a Hispanic channel called El Rey. The English-language channel is aimed at Latino and general audiences with a mix of reality, scripted and animated TV shows, movies and documentaries. Another Hispanic channel, BabyFirst Americas, has been proposed by Spanish-language television veteran Constantino “Said” Schwarz and  would be aimed at infants, very young children and their parents.",2212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/comcast-networks/comcast-launching-4-new-minority-owned-networks-idUSL2E8DLCAF20120221
250,CMCSA,Comcast launches subscription VOD with Streampix,"LOS ANGELES, Feb 21 (TheWrap.com) - Comcast is moving onto Netflix’s turf. The cable company is launching Xfinity Streampix, a new subscription video service that will allow its customer to view television shows and movies on demand. The catalogue titles will draw heavily on content deals with major studios and networks such as Warner Bros., Sony and Comcast’s corporate cousin, Universal. The service, however, will only be available to current Comcast customers. It will be available to subscribers for an additional $4.99 a month, but Comcast subscribers signed up for a triple-play package of video, broadband and phone can get the service for free. Among the films being offered are “When Harry Met Sally,” “Brokeback Mountain,” and “Stuart Little,” as well as television shows such as “Married With Children,” “30 Rock,” and “Lost.” The news comes on the heels of Netflix’s announcement that it has signed a pact with The Weinstein Company to stream such films as “The Artist,” “Sarah’s Key” and “Coriolanus.” Clearly, Comcast will have its work cut out for it matching that suite of titles, but it does boast a major studio partner in Universal and a lower price than Netflix. Comcast subscribers will be able to watch movies online, on mobile devices or on their televisions, the company said. In the coming year, the Streampix service will be available on additional devices such as Xbox 360 and Android-powered devices.

251,CMCSA,Comcast makes good on diversity promise - will it pay?,"LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Just how serious is Comcast about attracting Latino and African-American viewers? After all, in order to land NBCUniversal, the cable giant was required to commit to minority targeted programming. On Tuesday, Comcast said it would will carry four new independent channels from Earvin “Magic” Johnson, Sean “Diddy” Combs, “Desperado” director Robert Rodriguez, and Spanish language TV veteran Constantino “Said” Schwarz. Whether or not Comcast diversified willingly, supporters say that there is a real financial opportunity to attract an underserved demographic — provided the company takes the time to create a credible slate of programming as opposed to simply making a few token gestures. “If Comcast puts its weight behind this then it should be successful, but the question is how important is it to them and are the right people in place,” Todd Boyd, a professor of critical studies in the USC School of Cinematic Arts, told TheWrap. Boyd said that he was not entirely convinced that the cable giant’s initial slate of offerings showed a true commitment, suggesting that the company took the easy way out with bold-faced names rather than choosing people with TV programming know-how. Clearly the need to satisfy the Federal Communications Commission’s diversity requirements is largely responsible for Comcast’s announcement Tuesday. Comcast also stands to profit financially. “They have seen the Census as well and would love to know how to hit that demographic,” Rodriguez told TheWrap. “This is a requirement for Comcast, but they didn’t treat it like that. They want this to be successful.” Supporters say that entertainers likes Rodriguez and Combs, who know this audience, are key to helping this slate of programming stand out in a sea of cable channels. Comcast has a vested interest in pulling off the venture: In order to keep growing, it needs to come up with entertainment for expanding demographic groups. The proposed networks, which focus on everything from music to sports, are designed to be commercially viable and advertising friendly. “Diversity is a good thing for any company; it’s good for their bottom line,” Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for the Latino civil rights group, The National Council of La Raza, told TheWrap. “It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do.” Navarrete points out that studies show that Latino viewers are “brand loyal” and “oversubscribe” as media consumers. The same holds true for African-American audiences, which make up the largest minority segment of the U.S. television household population. In total, they represent 13 percent of the 109.6 million TV households surveyed by Nielsen. Of course, there is more competition for that demographic than there was even five years ago. In the case of African-Americans, BET is no longer the only game in town. Bounce TV launched last year and now vies with BET’s Centric and TV One. Moreover, while Spanish-language television has enjoyed a surge in popularity and now competes — and in some cases bests — English-language networks in certain timeslots, there are fresh challengers on the horizon. Disney and Univision are reportedly planning to pool their resources on a 24-hour news network aimed at Latino viewers. There are also a smattering of Latino and African-American themed programs scattered across other broadcast outlets. At least in its initial foray, Comcast seems to be banking on big media personalities as a way to attract viewers and differentiate themselves from the pack. That could be problematic, however, as Rodriguez, Johnson and Combs have been successful in their chosen careers but have no experience running a cable network. Boyd, for one, argues that Oprah Winfrey’s troubled experience in launching OWN may expose a flaw in the strategy. “Who in the history of television has been more successful than Oprah, and she struggled with launching her own network,” Boyd said. “So that is a lesson to anyone that there are no guarantees.” Though details are still being hammered out and the networks are months, even years away, from launching, it is clear that the proposed minority partners are interested in targeting certain niches within each demographic. Combs’ Revolt focuses on the music industry; Johnson’s Aspire will sport inspirational programming that could court the faith-based community; Schwarz’s BabyFirst Americas will center on children’s programming; and Rodriguez’s El Rey will feature reality, scripted and animated series. In the case of Rodriguez, there’s another important difference. Unlike Univision or Telemundo, El Rey will center on the Latino experience, but will be in English. “The Spanish-language channels are focused on first generation Latinos, but the boom is with the second and third generation,” Rodriguez said. “That’s people like my kids who are bilingual, and there’s nothing really on TV that represents their experience in this country.” The minority groups that pressured the FCC to make increasing diversity a requirement for approving the merger hope Comcast’s foray into minority programming will be a hit so that it encourages other entertainment companies to fall into line. “Whether Comcast went kicking or screaming or not, it is the future, and networks might as well get hip to it,” Stephanie Allain, producer of “Hustle and Flow” and director of the Los Angeles Film Festival, told TheWrap. “It not like these demographics are getting smaller.” ",2222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-diversity/comcast-makes-good-on-diversity-promise-will-it-pay-idUSTRE81L1HU20120222
252,CMCSA,Verizon tells Congress cable deals ease spectrum crunch,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications and Comcast executives, in testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, defended joint spectrum and marketing deals as a way for the wireless carrier to handle a coming spectrum crunch. Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. carrier, announced plans on December 2 to pay Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N $3.6 billion in spectrum and marketing deals. It reached a similar agreement with Cox Communications just days later. The cable operators would resell Verizon’s mobile service as part of the deals. Opponents have focused on Verizon’s already large spectrum holdings and cross-marketing agreements between Verizon and the cable companies, while some consumer advocates have said the companies should compete against each other, not collaborate. The Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department must approve the deals. The Justice Department recently blocked AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) purchase of T-Mobile USA, a deal that AT&T; said it needed to address spectrum shortages. Senator Herb Kohl, chair of the antitrust subcommittee, expressed concern that Verizon and Comcast would no longer compete as vigorously. “The fundamental question we must answer is whether these deals will bring beneficial new choices to consumers, or amount to previously fierce rivals standing down from competition.” Lawmakers have no official role in the legal review. During the hearing, Verizon and Comcast executives said that the spectrum sale and marketing agreement, which were announced at the same time, were being reviewed by antitrust and telecommunications regulators separately. “They are not contingent upon one another,” added Verizon Communications General Counsel Randall Milch. Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen concurred: “I do not disagree with Mr. Milch. There is no legal connection between them.” Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, noted in his comments that under the marketing agreement, each time Verizon or Comcast sold the other’s product there would be a one-time commission of “a few hundred dollars.” In his testimony, Milch argued that his company had spent billions to better use the spectrum it had but needed more because of the explosive use of spectrum-hogging smartphones, tablets and video and audio streaming. “We do not believe that we can engineer our way out of the spectrum crunch,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee. Data use on Verizon’s network has more than doubled each of the last three years, and is expected to continue growing, according to the company. But Steven Berry, president of RCA, a trade group of smaller wireless providers, urged regulators to block the deals, saying they would have an “insidious and disastrous effect on competition.” If not blocked, he urged the imposition of stringent conditions like spectrum divestitures and affordable roaming for smaller competitors. “Through the spectrum transaction, related marketing deals, and joint venture between the companies, Verizon will not compete for wired services with the cable companies, and the cable companies will not compete for wireless service with Verizon,” Berry said in written testimony. Former antitrust enforcers have said that the marketing deals would create allies out of former rivals, to the detriment of consumers. The Justice Department is known to be looking at the agreements. Comcast’s Cohen defended the marketing agreements and said they should arouse no concern. “The commercial agreements at issue here are ordinary and customary, market standard agreements. There is no merger here,” he said. “Not one competitor will be removed from the marketplace.” Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L). Verizon Wireless rivals, including Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N), T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS Communications Inc PCS.N, have urged regulators to block the Verizon deals. Deutsche Telekom AG’s (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile said the deals would result in “an excessive concentration” of spectrum holdings. Verizon Wireless and AT&T;, the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. mobile providers, have said they need more spectrum to support increased consumer demand for videos and other services that soak up bandwidth. Rick Rule, an antitrust expert at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP who testified on Wednesday, predicted the spectrum deal would be approved by the Justice Department. “A transaction that takes assets that are producing zero and is going to put the assets in hands of a company that is going to generate some output from those assets is by definition not a violation of the antitrust laws,” he said.

254,CMCSA,Court bars challenge to bundled cable channels,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Television programmers and distributors do not have to face a lawsuit that sought to compel them to sell cable channels separately to consumers, instead of in multi-channel packages, a U.S. appeals court ruled. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday found that the plaintiffs - cable and satellite TV subscribers - failed to state an antitrust claim against Walt Disney, Fox Entertainment Group Inc, Comcast Corp and several other companies. The plaintiffs intended to seek class-action status. Maxwell Blecher, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he was very disappointed in the decision and that his clients will likely seek review before a larger 9th Circuit panel. “It is so wrong,” Blecher said of the ruling. Glenn Pomerantz, an attorney for Fox, said the company was “extremely pleased” with the ruling. “The agreements between television programmers and cable and satellite operators do not injure competition in any way,” Pomerantz said. “They are totally legal and justifiable.” Representatives for Disney and Comcast could not immediately be reached. The lawsuit, filed in a California federal court, alleged that television programmers exploit their market power by requiring distributors to sell less desirable cable channels, along with select “must have” channels. Those business practices impair competition among distributors for consumer business, the plaintiffs alleged. The lower court dismissed the lawsuit, and on Friday, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel unanimously affirmed. “The complaint does not allege that programmers’ practice of selling ‘must-have’ and low-demand channels in packages excludes other sellers of low-demand channels from the market,” the court wrote, “or that this practice raises barriers to entry into the programming market.” The case in the 9th Circuit is Rob Brantley et al, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v.

256,CMCSA,FCC sides with Bloomberg over Comcast dispute,"(Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday told Comcast Corp that it must place Bloomberg LP’s financial news channel near other independent news channels in its channel lineup. Bloomberg last June filed a complaint with the FCC, accusing Comcast of violating a “neighborhooding” condition of its merger with NBC Universal that requires the cable operator to put similar channels in the same place in the lineup. Comcast had argued that it does not “neighborhood” any channels in its cable television lineup. But the FCC’s media bureau concluded on Wednesday that Comcast does in fact neighborhood news channels, which it defined as having four news channels within any five adjacent channel positions. The agency found that Bloomberg TV was left out of these news neighborhoods on some cable systems, according to an FCC order. Comcast will have to place Bloomberg TV near other news channels on some cable systems, particularly those that include multiple news neighborhoods. Comcast said it will immediately appeal the decision to the full Commission, and it was confident that this ruling would be overturned. Bloomberg’s complaint suggested that Comcast was discriminating against Bloomberg TV to increase viewership and advertising revenue for its affiliated programming, including CNBC, Bloomberg TV’s dominant competitor, and other news networks now controlled by the cable company. “Since by definition, no ‘discrimination’ against Bloomberg in favor of CNBC could have taken place before the NBCUniversal transaction, any retrospective condition on this subject would have been arbitrary and capricious,” Sena Fitzmaurice, Comcast’s vice president of government communications, said in a statement. “And there is simply no support in any record for a four channel definition of a ‘neighborhood,’” she added. Bloomberg, a financial news and data provider whose competitors include Thomson Reuters Corp, welcomed the FCC’s decision. “We are pleased the FCC had the foresight to include the news neighborhooding condition in the Comcast/NBCU merger order and the willingness to enforce it,” Greg Babyak, head of government affairs for Bloomberg, said in a statement.

257,CMCSA,U.S. FCC sides with Bloomberg over Comcast dispute,"May 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday told Comcast Corp that it must place Bloomberg LP’s financial news channel near other independent news channels in its channel lineup. Bloomberg last June filed a complaint with the FCC, accusing Comcast of violating a “neighborhooding” condition of its merger with NBC Universal that requires the cable operator to put similar channels in the same place in the lineup. Comcast had argued that it does not “neighborhood” any channels in its cable television lineup. But the FCC’s media bureau concluded on Wednesday that Comcast does in fact neighborhood news channels, which it defined as having four news channels within any five adjacent channel positions. The agency found that Bloomberg TV was left out of these news neighborhoods on some cable systems, according to an FCC order. Comcast will have to place Bloomberg TV near other news channels on some cable systems, particularly those that include multiple news neighborhoods. Comcast said it will immediately appeal the decision to the full Commission, and it was confident that this ruling would be overturned. Bloomberg’s complaint suggested that Comcast was discriminating against Bloomberg TV to increase viewership and advertising revenue for its affiliated programming, including CNBC, Bloomberg TV’s dominant competitor, and other news networks now controlled by the cable company. “Since by definition, no ‘discrimination’ against Bloomberg in favor of CNBC could have taken place before the NBCUniversal transaction, any retrospective condition on this subject would have been arbitrary and capricious,” Sena Fitzmaurice, Comcast’s vice president of government communications, said in a statement. “And there is simply no support in any record for a four channel definition of a ‘neighborhood,’” she added. Bloomberg, a financial news and data provider whose competitors include Thomson Reuters Corp, welcomed the FCC’s decision. “We are pleased the FCC had the foresight to include the news neighborhooding condition in the Comcast/NBCU merger order and the willingness to enforce it,” Greg Babyak, head of government affairs for Bloomberg, said in a statement.

258,CMCSA,"Comcast profit beats on Internet adds, NBC rebound","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on continued growth in high-speed Internet subscribers, a strong performance at its movie studio, and signs of a turnaround at its NBC broadcast business. But its shares dipped 2.5 percent as the No.1 U.S. cable company lost more video subscribers than some investors had expected in what has traditionally been its strongest quarter. Chief Executive Brian Roberts said on a conference call the company had a strong performance across the board with a noted improvement at NBC Universal, a cable networks-to-theme parks business. Philadelphia-based Comcast added more than 439,000 high-speed Internet subscribers during the quarter, and about 164,000 phone customers. It lost 37,000 video customers, down from losses of 39,000 a year earlier. “The expectation has gotten very high that Comcast could post video additions ... but these numbers are moving in the right direction,” said Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett. Comcast Cable chief Neil Smit told analysts on the call that the losses of video customers may have been exacerbated by an increase in prices that affected nearly 60 percent of its customers. First-quarter net income was $1.22 billion, or 45 cents a share, up from $943 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast 42 cents a share. Revenue rose 9.6 percent to $14.88 billion. “The wider results point to higher valuations - they beat on margins, on profits, on free cash flow,” Moffett said. At NBC Universal, revenue rose 18 percent to $5.47 billion, boosted by the broadcast of the 2012 Super Bowl in February. Even without that showpiece, the unit’s revenue was up 12.4 percent at $5.21 billion. Comcast acquired a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal from General Electric Co last year. NBC, the long-struggling No. 4 U.S. broadcast TV network, posted a 37 percent jump in revenue thanks to the Super Bowl. Without that program, revenue was still up by an impressive 18 percent. It was NBC’s best performance since Comcast took control of NBC Universal. But the TV unit was $10 million negative in operating cash flow as it invested heavily in new show launches, including the second season of “The Voice” and the debut of “Smash.” Universal Studios also posted a strong quarter with hit movies “The Lorax” and “Safe House,” helping to drive up revenue by 23 percent to $1.2 billion.

263,CMCSA,GE reaches deals to buy two mining equipment firms,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Tuesday it was buying two mining equipment firms, Australia’s Industrea Ltd IDL.AX for $700 million as well as a privately held U.S. company, as it seeks to boost its presence in a $61 billion industry. Chief Executive Jeff Immelt has stepped up GE’s presence in resource rich countries, including the oil-rich Middle East, although the company has stepped back from large-scale acquisitions after making an $11 billion wave of takeovers in the energy sector in 2010 and 2011. In addition to Industrea, which makes equipment used in the underground portion of mines, GE has also signed a binding letter of intent to buy Fairchild International of Glen Lyn, Virginia, for an undisclosed sum. The two businesses will be folded into GE’s transportation unit, which also makes railroad locomotives, heightening that division’s competition with fellow U.S. blue chip Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N). GE already makes power systems, as well as water purification equipment used in mining. Industrea mainly sells to customers in Australia and China - two markets that Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE has highlighted as key growth opportunities, said Lorenzo Simonelli, president and chief executive of GE Transportation. “Australia is an interesting marketplace for us and for the rest of GE,” Simonelli said in an interview. GE will aim to distribute its products to a wider range of countries, he said. Immelt has said he is interested in buying small companies with interesting technology that GE can grow, and has repeatedly told investors he is not planning to do a “big deal” in 2012. GE said it expects both deals to close later this year.

266,CMCSA,"""Battleship"" bomb may hit studio's profits: analysts","(Reuters) - “Battleship,” Universal Picture’s big budget science fiction film, is likely to dent the studio’s profits after it opened with lower than forecast ticket sales, according to analysts. The film, which Comcast unit Universal has said cost $209 million to produce, generated $23.4 million in ticket sales at theaters in the U.S. and Canada during its opening weekend, according to figures compiled by Hollywood.com. It had been projected by tracking services used by Hollywood studios to have ticket sales of between $35 million and $40 million. The movie, which stars Liam Neeson and the singer Rihanna, finished the weekend second to Walt Disney’s superhero blockbuster “The Avengers,” which led the box office for the third weekend with $55.1 million in ticket sales. “It is not quite the epic disaster of ‘John Carter,’ but this will put a dent in Comcast’s quarter,” said Matthew Harrigan of Wunderlich Securities, who follows Comcast. He did not quantify how much he expected the film to lose. “John Carter,” which sold $30.2 million during its opening weekend in March, saddled Disney with a $200 million loss, the company said. That film cost more than $250 million to produce. Based on the “John Carter” performance, Universal will lose $100 million to $200 million, estimates Michael Morris of Davenport & Co., who does not follow Comcast, but follows Disney, News Corp. and Time Warner, which also have studio units. A Universal spokeswoman would not comment. Comcast officials were not immediately available for comment. The studio is estimated to have spent more than $100 million to market the film, standard for large budget films. “Battleship” has sold more than $220 million in overseas tickets, Universal has said. It is forecast to reach $250 million in foreign sales. Movie studios generally receive about half of the revenues from ticket sales in North America and less in foreign markets. The film needed to generate more than $50 million in weekend ticket sales to break even, said analyst Tony Wible, a managing director at Janney Montgomery Scott who compiles a data base on film performances. He does not follow Comcast. Last week, Disney’s superhero franchise-builder surprised experts by cutting into the expected weekend ticket sales of “Dark Shadows,” starring Johnny Depp, which took in just $29.7 million, according to Box Office Mojo. During the coming weekend, “Battleship,” loosely based on the Hasbro board game, will face the third installment of Will Smith’s futuristic comedy “Men in Black.” The last one in the series, in 2002, generated $190.4 million in domestic ticket sales.

Comcast customers will be the first to make use of the app, which would be similar to Disney’s WatchESPN service, which allows cable subscribers to receive ESPN programs on mobile devices, Iger told a conference sponsored by securities firm Sanford C. Bernstein. The service would be limited at the outset to subscribers of Comcast, who would be “authenticated” to access the family friendly channel through their TV subscriptions. The cable industry calls mobile services “TV Everywhere” and see them as key to keeping subscribers from dropping their service and opting instead for online programming. Iger said Disney is launching on Comcast first because the cable company secured expanded TV rights as part of an agreement in January to renew a 10-year contract to carry the Disney Channel, ESPN and other channels. WatchESPN was first offered by Time Warner Cable Inc, Iger said. In early May, Comcast began offering the sports service for mobile and online use to most of its 22 million TV subscribers, which increased the number of people with the capability to receive it to about 40 million. Iger said Disney also intended eventually to offer apps for some of its other TV properties, including its ABC network and ABC Family cable channel, but did not say when those would be available. The CEO of the largest U.S. entertainment conglomerate also criticized satellite operator Dish Networks Corp and its “Hopper” DVR. Iger said the new device, which allows viewers to skip TV commercials from network programs, “is harmful to the broadcast industry.” It “has a bit of the feeling of biting the hand that feeds you,” Iger told the investor conference.

275,CMCSA,Comcast studio hunts for new COO: sources,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Universal Pictures Vice Chairman Rick Finkelstein, the studio’s chief operating officer for 12 years, decided to retire, sources told Reuters, a move that will allow Comcast Corp to put its imprint on leadership of the studio it acquired in 2009 along with parent NBC Universal. Universal hired Spencer Stuart’s Jim Citrin this spring to find a new COO to replace Finkelstein, according to two people with knowledge of the search. Comcast overhauled top executives at its NBC TV operations soon after making the acquisition, but resisted making changes at the movie studio. Finkelstein will spend the final two years of his contract working on special projects for Ron Meyer, head of the Universal Studios unit that oversees the studio and theme park operations, those people told Reuters. Universal Pictures Chairman Adam Fogelson will make the hire, although NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke, a Comcast executive vice president, will have input on the selection. NBCU, the studio and Finkelstein had no comment. Universal has had a mixed record since Comcast acquired a 51 percent stake. This year, the studio had a blockbuster with “Dr. Suess’ The Lorax”, which collected domestic ticket sales of $212 million, and “Safe House” with over $126 million. It ranks third among Hollywood studios with a 14.6 percent share of the box office this year, according to Box Office Mojo.

276,CMCSA,Comcast studio hunts for new COO: sources,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Universal Pictures Vice Chairman Rick Finkelstein, the studio’s chief operating officer for 12 years, decided to retire, sources told Reuters, a move that will allow Comcast Corp to put its imprint on leadership of the studio it acquired in 2009 along with parent NBC Universal. Universal hired Spencer Stuart’s Jim Citrin this spring to find a new COO to replace Finkelstein, according to two people with knowledge of the search. Comcast overhauled top executives at its NBC TV operations soon after making the acquisition, but resisted making changes at the movie studio. Finkelstein will spend the final two years of his contract working on special projects for Ron Meyer, head of the Universal Studios unit that oversees the studio and theme park operations, those people told Reuters. Universal Pictures Chairman Adam Fogelson will make the hire, although NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke, a Comcast executive vice president, will have input on the selection. NBCU, the studio and Finkelstein had no comment. Universal has had a mixed record since Comcast acquired a 51 percent stake. This year, the studio had a blockbuster with “Dr. Suess’ The Lorax”, which collected domestic ticket sales of $212 million, and “Safe House” with over $126 million. It ranks third among Hollywood studios with a 14.6 percent share of the box office this year, according to Box Office Mojo. It released the mega-dud “Battleship”, which cost $209 million to make, but has collected only $60 million domestically and $295 million worldwide. Studios get roughly half the ticket sales.

277,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-U.S. probes cable TV barriers to Internet video,"* Justice investigating programming deals, Internet caps * Comcast’s NBC acquisition probed for breaches * Netflix complained Comcast blocking competing services By Ronald Grover LOS ANGELES, June 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether cable television companies are improperly suppressing competition from  Internet companies and online video services, according to two people with direct knowledge of the probe. The wide-ranging probe centers on cable companies’ long-standing practice of bundling channels into a single package and requiring subscriptions to access certain online content, one of the sources said on condition of anonymity because the inquiry has not been made public. Justice Department investigators are also examining whether Comcast violated a 2011 consent settlement under which the cable operator is prohibited from “unreasonably discriminating in the transmission of an online video distributor’s lawful network traffic,” according to the second of the sources, who has knowledge of the government’s information collection. “I’ve been saying to myself that the cable companies are in trouble. Who needs TV?” said John Briggs, an antitrust attorney with Axinn, Veltrop and Harkrider LLP. “Any program I like is probably on Netflix.” The investigation also encompasses the industry’s practice of inserting “most favored nation” clauses into contracts, which secure for cable operators the lowest prices on content, according to the second person. Justice Department officials will additionally look at the use of caps to limit the amount of data consumers can download each month, a practice that online competitors such as Netflix  have complained would block adoption of data-intensive services, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the investigation. Earlier this year, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings complained in a Facebook post that Comcast - the No. 1 cable services operator - gave its own Xfinity video service priority over online services offered by Netflix, Hulu and others. Comcast has since lifted “caps” on how much capacity its users can employ monthly, the core of Hastings’ complaint. “We have consistently treated all video carried over the public Internet the same whether it comes from our sites or anywhere else on the public Internet,” the cable operator said in a corporate blog at the time it changed its policy. Comcast and the Justice Dept both declined to comment on Wednesday. The cable operator has spent $4.6 million on lobbying so far this year, more than any other technology company aside from  Google, which has spent $5 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The five largest media companies, including content producers such as Walt Disney and cable operator Time Warner Cable, spent $10 million to influence Washington. The five largest technology companies, including Apple  and Microsoft, spent a combined $8 million. Cable operators were receiving letters requesting they meet with Justice Dept as recently as two weeks ago, said one of the sources. “The Department of Justice has a specific hook sunk deep into Comcast, which is their consent decree,” said Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of America. “They are a leader in broadband. It is fully understandable that they are going to test the limits.” ",6132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/media-probe/update-1-u-s-probes-cable-tv-barriers-to-internet-video-idUSL1E8HDHAO20120613

281,CMCSA,US Supreme Court to hear Comcast antitrust appeal,"* Comcast accused of monopolizing Philadelphia cable TV market * Lower court allowed customers to pursue class-action * Supreme Court decision likely in 2012-2013 term By Jonathan Stempel WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review Comcast Corp’s appeal of a ruling that let cable TV subscribers in the Philadelphia area sue as a group over alleged overcharges stemming from an effort to monopolize that market. In a brief order on Monday, the nation’s highest court said it will consider whether a trial court may certify a case as a class-action without first determining whether plaintiffs have introduced admissible evidence, including expert testimony, to justify awarding damages to the class as a whole. Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, had argued that the subscribers, who live in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, did not have enough in common to sue as a group. Class-action lawsuits can help plaintiffs recover more money and save on legal costs by not forcing them to sue individually. The Supreme Court in its 2010-2011 term narrowed the ability of various plaintiffs to bring such lawsuits, in separate unrelated rulings involving AT&T; Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. In the Comcast case, which was first brought in 2003, several subscribers accused the Philadelphia-based company of amassing a dominant position through a strategy, begun five years earlier, of buying rivals or swapping coverage areas, resulting in a “clustering” of services. They said this allowed Comcast to triple its market share in the Philadelphia area, which peaked at 77.8 percent in 2002, and charge excessive prices, violating federal antitrust law. In a decision last August, a panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled a trial judge had discretion to decide whether the plaintiffs would eventually be able to establish a common methodology to quantify damages, and that antitrust violations led to higher class-wide costs. It said that to require more would essentially turn judges into juries, and “runs dangerously close to stepping on the toes of the Seventh Amendment by preempting the jury’s factual findings with our own.” The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments and decide the Comcast case in its next term, which begins in October. The case is Comcast Corp et al v. Behrend et al, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 11-864.",6252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-comcast/us-supreme-court-to-hear-comcast-antitrust-appeal-idUSL2E8HP8U020120625

283,CMCSA,TEXT-Fitch rates Comcast snr unsecured notes 'BBB+',"June 26 - Fitch Ratings has assigned a ‘BBB+’ rating to Comcast Corporation’s (Comcast) 3.125% senior notes due July 15, 2022 and its 4.65% senior notes due July 15, 2042. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including refinancing debt. The notes will be guaranteed by Comcast’s subsidiaries included in the company’s cross guaranty structure. The rating Outlook for all of Comcast’s ratings is Stable. As of March 31, 2012 Comcast had approximately $37.8 billion of debt outstanding.  The issuance is in line with Comcast’s overall financial strategy and Fitch’s  expectations. Consolidated leverage was 2.0x as of March 31, 2012 (LTM basis),  which is at the lower end of Comcast’s leverage target ranging between 2x and  2.5x. To date Comcast has reduced debt by approximately $2.3 billion through the early redemption of retail bonds and repayment of current maturities. Fitch  expects Comcast’s leverage to remain in the lower end of the company’s leverage  target strongly positioning the credit profile within the current rating  category.      Fitch believes Comcast’s solid free cash flow metrics afford the company a high  degree of financial flexibility at the current rating category. The company  generated approximately $8.7 billion of free cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends) during the LTM  period ended March 31, 2012. Fitch anticipates that the company will  consistently generate free cash flow in excess of $5 billion annually after  considering higher cash taxes due to the absence of further economic stimulus  legislation.   Fitch does not expect any material change to Comcast’s capital allocation  strategy over the near term. The company maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, repaying debt, and investing in the strategic needs of its  business. Cash generated from the cable business will be used to return cash to  Comcast shareholders while cash generated at NBCUniversal will build-up in  anticipation of obligations related to GE’s ownership put rights. NBC Universal  had nearly $1.2 billion of cash as of March 31, 2012. Cash returned to  shareholders (dividends plus buybacks) totaled nearly $1.1 billion or  approximately 33% of cash flow before dividends during the first quarter of  2012. As of March 31, 2012 approximately $5.8 billion of capacity remains under  Comcast’s share repurchase authorization. Comcast intends to repurchase $3.0  billion of its common stock during 2012 subject to market conditions.   Comcast’s liquidity position and overall financial flexibility are strong owing  to Fitch’s expectation that the company will continue to generate material  amounts of free cash flow. The liquidity position if further supported by cash  on hand (which totaled $2.2 billion as of March 31, 2012) and available  borrowing capacity from Comcast’s $6.25 billion revolver (all which was  available for borrowing). Comcast’s revolver will expire on June, 2017.   Comcast’s debt maturity profile is well laddered and within Fitch’s FCF  expectation for the company. Scheduled maturities during the remainder of 2012  total approximately $800 million followed by $2.4 billion and $2 billion in 2013 and 2014, respectively.   Fitch’s ratings incorporate Comcast’s strong competitive position as one of the  largest video, high speed internet and phone providers to residential and  business customers in the United States and the company’s compelling subscriber  clustering profile with operations in 39 states and the District of Columbia. In Fitch’s view NBCUniversal’s size, scale, leading brand positions and diversity  of operations and business risk as one of the world’s most prominent media and  entertainment companies, lowers the business risk attributable to Comcast’s  credit profile and creates new avenues for revenue and cash flow growth while  limiting the near-term impact on Comcast’s balance sheet and credit profile.   Outside of a change to Comcast’s financial strategy or event driven merger and  acquisition activity, rating concerns center on Comcast’s ability to adapt to  the evolving operating environment while maintaining its relative competitive  position given the challenging competitive environment and weak housing and  employment trends. Considering the mature nature of video services and growing  penetration of high speed data services, Comcast’s ability to grow consumer  revenues while maintaining operating margins remains a key rating consideration.  Positive rating action would likely coincide with Comcast committing to reduce  leverage below 2x on a sustained basis after considering Comcast’s potential  funding obligations related to GE’s ownership put rights related to  NBCUniversal. Meanwhile Comcast would need to demonstrate that its operating  profile will not materially decline in the face of competition and poor housing  and employment conditions. Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide  with discretional actions of Comcast’s management including, but not limited to  the company adopting a more aggressive financial strategy or an event driven  merger and acquisition activity.",6262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA006920120626

The FCC said it began the probe after it was tipped that Comcast was not properly marketing its standalone broadband services, violating a condition of its merger with NBC Universal that requires the cable operator to offer reasonably priced Internet services to consumers who do not subscribe to its cable offerings. “Today’s action demonstrates that compliance with Commission orders is not optional,” said FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski. The consent decree adopted on Wednesday requires Comcast to pay $800,000 to the U.S. Treasury to resolve the dispute. It also, for the first time in FCC history, extends the merger condition for an additional year. “The unprecedented merger condition extension, significant voluntary contribution, and robust compliance plan send a clear message to the American public and the communications industry that the FCC will vigorously enforce its merger conditions, to the ultimate benefit of consumers,” FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Michele Ellison said. Sena Fitzmaurice, Comcast’s vice president of government communications, said the company was pleased that it could address these issues constructively with the FCC and in a consensual manner. Comcast, the No. 1 provider of video and residential Internet service in the United States, acquired a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal from General Electric Co last year. Approval of the merger after a year-long review by the FCC and Justice Department came with a list of conditions to protect the public interest and prevent anti-competitive practices. Among those conditions was a requirement to actively market for three years a standalone broadband service with speeds of at least 6 mbps for no more than $49.95 per month - equivalent to terms offered to consumers who bundled their cable and broadband services with Comcast. “Comcast has incorporated the extensive commitments and conditions from the NBCUniversal transaction into the DNA of our business practices, including the commitment to offer standalone broadband Internet,” said Fitzmaurice. The company introduced a “Performance Starter” option for standalone broadband service to comply with the merger condition. The FCC probe questioned if that service could have been rolled out differently or better, Fitzmaurice said. Wednesday’s consent decree means Comcast must keep that standalone service in place through February 21, 2015. It also mandates a dedicated Internet page for standalone broadband services, a major advertising promotion in 2013 for the broadband services and training for customer service representatives to ensure they are familiar with the Performance Starter option.

292,CMCSA,Comcast buys Microsoft stake in MSNBC.com,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the parent company of NBC, has bought out Microsoft Corp’s 50 percent stake in MSNBC.com for a reported $300 million to assume full control of the news website. The deal ends 16 years of a 50-50 joint venture between Microsoft and NBCUniversal, which is now majority-owned by Comcast Corp, NBC said. “Today we’re taking on a new name — NBCNews.com. While our name is changing, our commitment is not,” Jennifer Sizemore, editor-in-chief of NBCNews.com, said in a letter posted on the company’s website. “The ties are deep, and untangling them will take at least two years,” the network said. The New York Times reported on Sunday the transaction was valued at $300 million, a part of which comes from the joint venture’s past profits, citing people with knowledge of the deal. NBC and Microsoft joined forces in 1996 to create a cable news channel and online news operation that melded broadcasting with then-emerging internet technology. At that time, Microsoft invested $220 million for its 50 percent stake in NBC. In 2005, the companies terminated their partnership operating the MSNBC cable channel and NBC was acquired by Comcast four years later. MSN said in a blog it will be delivering a new news service in the fall that will be focused on its online consumers “harnessing real-time signals produced by social networks using the power of search to deliver breaking updates”. Analysts welcomed the move, saying it simplified Comcast’s structure. Earlier this month, Comcast said NBC Universal would sell its 16 percent stake in History Channel owner A&E; Television Networks for $3 billion. Two months earlier Comcast said it would exercise an option to sell a “substantial portion” of its holding to its joint-venture partners Disney-ABC Television Group and Hearst Corp. “NBC (51%-owned by CMCSA) already bought in MSFT’s stake in the cable channel MSNBC in 2005, and now NBC can more effectively cross-sell advertising of the unified brand on TV and online,” said David Joyce, an analyst at Miller Tabak.

MSNBC.com was renamed NBCNews.com and users were automatically redirected to the new website. NBC and Microsoft joined forces in 1996 to create a cable news channel and online news operation that melded broadcasting with then-emerging internet technology. The news of a possible buyout was first reported in May. “MSNBC TV will launch a new digital home in 2013, as an extension of the MSNBC TV on-air brand,” the editor-in-chief of MSNBC.com wrote in a letter posted on MSNBC website.

296,CMCSA,Tennis Channel ekes out FCC win over Comcast on carriage rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission upheld an administrative law judge’s ruling that Comcast Corp discriminated against the Tennis Channel when it placed the network in a more expensive viewing tier than Comcast’s affiliated sports networks. The agency voted 3-2 along party lines last week to require Comcast to move the independent Tennis Channel within 45 days to a tier in line with and reaching the same number of subscribers as the tier carrying Comcast’s Golf Channel and NBC Sports Network. The ruling is the first time a cable network has prevailed over a cable operator under the FCC’s 1993 federal anti-discrimination program carriage rules. FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski and his fellow Democrats on the panel, Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel, concluded in an order released late Tuesday that discrimination in favor of Comcast’s affiliated networks “unreasonably restrained Tennis Channel’s ability to compete.” Comcast was also ordered to pay a $375,000 fine. “This decision could not have come at a better time for Comcast customers across this country, as we approach Tennis Channel’s coverage of the U.S. Open beginning August 27,” the network said in a statement. Comcast could have had to add the network to an additional 18 million households, incurring millions of dollars more in programming costs that it will owe the Tennis Channel - an expense likely to trickle down to Comcast subscribers. Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company and the top broadband provider, said it will appeal the decision to the courts and examine options for requesting a stay of the decision from going into effect. The Tennis Channel filed a complaint with the FCC in 2010, alleging discriminatory treatment. It sought wider distribution on par with other networks, which would attract more advertising revenue and increase fees calculated on a per-subscriber basis that Comcast paid to air its content. Comcast contended that its 2005 contract with the network stipulated placement in a more expensive sports tier sought by fewer subscribers, and said a move would impose higher costs on its basic cable subscribers. An FCC administrative law judge ruled last December in favor of the Tennis Channel’s argument that it was losing out on revenue by not being included in Comcast’s basic programming package, in contrast to sports networks owned by Comcast. Comcast was granted an interim stay from the FCC, which required the full commission to vote on the matter and allowed Comcast to leave the channel where it was until that vote. “The decision will accomplish nothing other than to drive up programming costs and enrich a group of wealthy investors in the Tennis Channel,” said Comcast/NBCUniversal Washington President Kyle McSlarrow in a statement. Comcast acquired a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal from General Electric Co last year. McSlarrow argued the decision misapplies statutory standards for discrimination and competitive harm, ignores evidence from unbiased cost-benefit analyses and violates Comcast’s First Amendment rights. FCC Republican Commissioners Robert McDowell and Ajit Pai agreed with the cable operator’s assessment that the Tennis Channel’s placement was not discriminatorily motivated by ownership interests. McDowell and Pai noted in their dissent that no major pay TV provider in 2010 when the complaint was filed found the Tennis Channel to warrant similar distribution to the Golf Channel and NBC Sports Network, previously called Versus. The ruling, they said, will lead to cable and satellite operators carrying more “networks they do not want, on tiers with broader penetration, and at higher prices than ever before” to stave off discrimination complaints.

298,CMCSA,Comcast profit beats; Olympics seen at break-even,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) posted a higher-than-expected profit on Wednesday as an increase in Internet and phone customers offset weakness at its NBC Universal unit, and executives said the company no longer expected to lose money on its expensive Olympics 2012 coverage. “We think London is going to be right around break-even, and there was a time when we thought London would be as negative as $200 million,” said NBC Universal Chief Executive Steve Burke on a call with investors. “We are way ahead of where we thought we would be.” Shares of Comcast, the largest U.S. cable TV operator, rose as much as 4.6 percent after the comments. “Investors now have less reason to wait till the third-quarter results to see what kind of loss they presumed they were going to generate,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Thomas Eagan. “They’re now trying to buy ahead.” Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts himself has made a strong commitment to the Olympics as a flagship brand to keep with NBC, the famed “Peacock” broadcast network, and the company’s cable channels. Last year, Roberts led the team to bid for rights to the next four games through 2020. Burke said that given the trends, NBCU has a chance of making money on future Olympics. For this year, NBC Universal has made every Olympics event available live online for sports fans who are pay-TV subscribers. But there has been some controversy, particularly because of delayed showings of some of the most popular Olympics events until prime time. This has led some fans to circumvent the NBCU broadcasts to seek out feeds from other countries online. Comcast added 156,000 high-speed Internet subscribers and 158,000 phone customers during the second quarter. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity had expected additions of just 97,000 Internet subscribers and 143,000 phone customers. Comcast’s video subscriber base continued to shrink, though at a slower rate than in recent quarters. It lost 176,000 subscribers during the quarter. “The cable business looks like a perfect place for investors to hide right now,” said Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett. “It’s stable, defensive, and still very attractively valued.” Revenue at NBC Universal dipped 0.8 percent to $5.50 billion, and operating cash flow dropped 15.4 percent. At the struggling NBC broadcast business, revenue fell 9 percent from a year earlier, when it received advance licensing fees from Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) for TV shows like “Law & Order.” The Universal Studios business had negative cash flow of $83 million, which it blamed on the expensive movie flop “Battleship.” Revenue from Comcast’s cable networks, which include Bravo, CNBC and MSNBC, rose 3.6 percent to $2.25 billion. Second-quarter net income rose to $1.35 billion, or 50 cents a share, from $1.02 billion, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected a profit of 48 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose by 6.1 percent to $15.21 billion. Shares of Comcast were up 3.5 percent at $33.64 in morning trading after rising as high as $34.00. Comcast took a 51 percent controlling stake in NBC Universal in January 2011, and several longtime cable analysts have been uncertain of the acquisition’s impact on the cable company’s results. “It’s not a huge part of the Comcast story,” said Moffett, “but it certainly begs the question of whether Comcast would have been better off to stick to its knitting in a cable core that, for now at least, simply looks like a better business.” ",8012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-earnings/comcast-profit-beats-olympics-seen-at-break-even-idUSBRE8700KA20120801

305,CMCSA,"After Olympics success, Bell poised for promotion at NBC","* Bell advancement could come within 6 months - source * Likely in line for larger role at NBC Sports * Producer well-regarded by Comcast, open to anything - sources By Liana B. Baker Aug 17 (Reuters) - Jim Bell, the executive producer who spearheaded NBC’s London Olympics coverage and shouldered most of the criticism directed at the network, is poised for a promotion to a larger role within NBC’s news or sports division, according to four sources familiar with the situation. These sources say Bell is well-regarded by Steve Burke, the Comcast executive who runs NBC Universal for the cable company, and is likely to move up within the next six months. Ahead of the Olympics there were internal rumors that Bell, who also serves as executive producer of the “Today” show, was in line for a bigger job at NBC News, which is currently headed by Steve Capus. That talk petered out when Capus kept his job after Comcast reorganized the division in July, bringing in Patricia Fili-Krushel to head the news unit’s business operations. One of the sources, who is close to NBC, said Bell is probably in line for a kind of uber-producing sports role like the one Dick Ebersol - NBC’s longtime Olympics executive producer and former Sports Chief who served as a mentor to Bell - played for the network. According to the same person, Comcast is happy with current NBC Sports Group Chairman Mark Lazarus, who took that post in 2011, so the company may create a new position for Bell, one that would possibly have him oversee the Olympics full-time. NBC has a contract to broadcast the Olympics in the United States for the next four games in Russia, Brazil, South Korea and an unnamed host city in 2020. London marked the first time Bell was in charge of coverage of the games, filling the shoes of Ebersol, who left NBC in May 2011. Despite flak from social media sites for having delayed  airing major events until prime time, NBC’s London Olympics coverage drew an average of 31.1 million viewers per night, 12 percent above the Beijing Olympics and a record for any games shown. The strong ratings performance means Comcast, which initially expected to lose money on the $1.18 billion it paid for the Olympics broadcast rights, now expects to break even and turn a small profit. “I think Bell’s gained amazing (recognition) for what he’s done at the games. By far without question this is the best-produced games I’ve ever seen,” said Andre Mika, a marketing executive and former sports producer who directed NBC’s HD broadcast of the Athens Olympics in 2004. Bell, through a representative, declined to be interviewed for this story. NBC also declined to comment. Bell’s immediate task is to stabilize the “Today” show, where he has served as executive producer for the last seven years. NBC’s most profitable show, “Today” generated $612 million in revenue last year, according to Kantar Media. But it has suffered from lower ratings and bad publicity over the ouster of co-host Ann Curry in recent months. After dominating the morning-show ratings with a 16-year unbeaten streak, “Today” earlier this year lost the top slot to ABC’s “Good Morning America,” which now runs neck-and-neck with “Today” in the ratings, occasionally taking the weekly crown. In an interview posted by the Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday, Bell called the Olympics a “cleansing moment” for the show and said it needs to maintain the ratings boost it got from the games. Trouble is, the show has already lost the post-Olympics glow. “GMA” beat “Today” in total viewers in two out of the first three days after the Olympics ended, according to preliminary Nielsen data distributed by ABC. Mark Fratrik, vice president of media research firm BIA/Kelsey, said if the “Today” show’s ratings keep sagging, “It would be time over the next few months to bring in somebody who has some different ideas.” But Bell, who returned to work on “Today” just two days after the closing ceremonies, “may not want the perception that he abandoned the ‘Today’ show just when things got tough, especially when things got tough on his watch,” said one industry executive. Bell received kudos inside and outside of NBC for openly engaging with the network’s social media critics. Tweeting under the logo “Keep Calm and Watch The Olympics,” he responded to questions from local affiliates, tweeted ratings performance updates and interacted with frustrated viewers. Bell, 45, a former defensive lineman on Harvard’s football team, joined NBC in 1990 to work on the Barcelona Olympics and has worked on every summer Olympics since. He has also produced broadcasts of football, basketball and baseball games for NBC. That experience dovetails with NBC’s push to expand its sports programming. Comcast clearly views sports as a growth area for NBC — last year it rebranded the cable channel Versus as the NBC Sports Network. The network’s contract with the NFL runs until 2022 and it signed a 10-year deal with the National Hockey League in 2011.

307,CMCSA,Comcast losses bid to limit class action case,"(Reuters) - In the latest test of U.S. class action limits, telecoms firm Comcast Corp. lost a bid on Tuesday to force a customer who filed an antitrust class action to arbitrate individually, when a judge ruled it would be too costly for the customer. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill in New Haven, Conn. follows a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in April 2011 that upheld a class action waiver clause in AT&T; Inc.’s contracts. Since the AT&T; ruling, companies have sought to avoid costly class actions by requiring consumers and employees to arbitrate their disputes individually. In the latest case, a Comcast subscriber had filed a class action in 2009 accusing the firm of violating U.S. antitrust laws by unlawfully bundling digital voice service with a modem. Subscribers had no choice but to pay a rental fee for the modem, the complaint said. Comcast had sought to use the Supreme Court ruling to force Robert Fromer of Windsor, Conn. to bring his claims in arbitration, citing clauses in his subscriber agreement. U.S. District Judge Underhill denied the motion on Tuesday, citing the cost of forcing Fromer to litigate on his own. He said Fromer might expect to recover $1 for every $202 he spent in litigation and recover damages of up to $495. “Therefore, because the class action waiver in this case effectively precludes Fromer from pursuing federal statutory remedies, the class arbitration waiver is void,” Underhill wrote. The ruling follows a similar decision by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in February finding American Express Co could not use arbitration clauses to avoid an antitrust lawsuit by merchant customers. Representatives for Comcast did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday after normal business hours. A lawyer for Fromer also did not respond to a call or e-mail seeking comment.

309,CMCSA,Tennis Channel's upgrade on Comcast stalled pending appeal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp will not have to move the independent Tennis Channel to a tier in line with competing sports networks until a pending court challenge is concluded, a U.S. appeals court said on Friday. The Federal Communications Commission in July upheld an administrative law judge’s ruling that Comcast discriminated against the Tennis Channel when it placed the network in a more expensive viewing tier than Comcast’s affiliated sports networks. Under the FCC order, Comcast would have had to move the Tennis Channel within 45 days to a tier reaching the same number of subscribers as the tier carrying Comcast’s Golf Channel and NBC Sports Network. The Tennis Channel is owned by a group of private-equity firms and former tennis stars. Comcast asked a federal appeals court to reverse the FCC’s ruling, arguing the move violated the company’s constitutional rights and would result in millions of dollars in costs. The top U.S. cable operator also filed an emergency motion earlier in the month to stay the FCC’s decision pending the court’s review, arguing that it would likely succeed on the merits, and a stay would prevent “irreversible harms to Comcast” while not injuring the Tennis Channel. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the motion on Friday. Comcast could have had to add the network to an additional 18 million households, incurring millions of dollars more in programming costs that it will owe the Tennis Channel - an expense likely to trickle down to Comcast subscribers. Sena Fitzmaurice, Comcast’s vice president of government communications, said the stay will spare its customers needless disruption. The Tennis Channel said it was disappointed by the court’s action. “We believe that the FCC’s decision was correct and that the court will agree with the FCC when it considers the full case,” Tennis Channel spokesman Eric Abner said. The FCC’s ruling, decided in a 3-2 vote along party lines, is the first time a cable network has prevailed over a cable operator under the FCC’s 1993 federal anti-discrimination program carriage rules. Republican Commissioners Robert McDowell and Ajit Pai, who cited First Amendment concerns in their dissent from the FCC ruling, said on Friday that they were pleased with the court’s decision. A representative from FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

311,CMCSA,UPDATE 3-NBC Olympics coverage boosts Comcast quarterly results,"* Earnings of 46 cents a share match Wall Street estimates * Comcast loses fewer cable video customers than expected * NBC has ratings momentum-analyst * Cable ad spending to rise in Q4 on election-analyst * Shares up 2.3 percent By Liana B. Baker Oct 26 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp posted higher quarterly profit on Friday after its NBC Universal media unit scored $1.2 billion in additional revenue from its London Olympics coverage The leading U.S. cable TV operator, whose shares rose 2.3 percent, also benefited from adding Internet users. Because of the Olympics, “broadcast actually made money for the first time in a long time,” said Macquarie analyst Amy Yong. The London Olympics coverage helped NBC Universal’s revenue climb more than 30 percent to $6.8 billion from a year earlier. The games drew a record audience that averaged 31.3 million viewers per night, 12 percent above the Beijing Olympics. With the strong ratings performance over the summer, Comcast said it will at least break even on its $1.18 billion deal for the London Olympics. Analysts initially expected the company to lose money on the London Olympics. Comcast and NBC have the rights to broadcast the next four Olympic contests through 2020. CEO Brian Roberts said Comcast will eventually turn a profit from the future games. “We now have more confidence than ever that the Olympics can be profitable for our company,” Roberts told analysts on a conference call. To the surprise of industry analysts, NBC has been No. 1 in TV ratings in the key 18-49 age group for the first four weeks of the fall season. Yong, the Macquarie analyst, said Comcast shares were trading higher on Friday on momentum from NBC’s recent ratings surge that could extend into the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, revenues at NBC Universal’s NBC broadcast unit jumped 84 percent to $2.78 billion “It’s certainly early, but I believe and hope we are seeing the beginning of a turnaround at NBC,” Roberts said on the call. Revenues for NBC Universal’s movie business rose 24 percent to $1.35 billion on the strong box office for such movies as quirky comedy “Ted” and action film “The Bourne Legacy.” Comcast took a 51 percent controlling stake in NBC Universal in January 2011, but still generates the bulk of its revenue from its steady cable TV business. Revenue at the cable unit rose 7 percent to $9.97 billion. It added 287,000 Internet customers, beating research firm StreetAccount estimates of 277,000 additions. The company lost 117,000 video customers, fewer than the loss of 133,000 that StreetAccount expected. Comcast now has 22 million video customers. Yong said she had expected Comcast to add video subscribers in the fourth quarter. Average revenue per video customer rose about 9 percent to $150.73 as more subscribers bought pricier products, such as high-definition digital recorder devices. Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said cable advertising was the standout item in the quarter, with a 24 percent gain thanks to a jump in political advertising. Moffett expects a major boost in political advertising in the fourth quarter as campaigns make use of cable technology to target ads in battleground districts. “Only cable can deliver that kind of geographical targeting,” Moffett said in a research note. Comcast posted third-quarter net income of $2.1 billion, or 78 cents a share, compared to $908 million, or 33 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding gains from sales of wireless spectrum and its stake in A&E; Networks, earnings came to 46 cents a share, matching the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 15 percent to $16.54 billion - above Wall Street estimates of $16.08 billion.

315,CMCSA,UPDATE 3-Hurricane Sandy disrupts Northeast US telecom networks,"* FCC says 25 percent of region’s cell towers out of action * Verizon has flooding central offices, West Street out of action * AT&T;, T-Mobile USA, Sprint suffer service problems * Comcast, Verizon Wireless also cite problems By Sinead Carew NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Power outages and flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy disrupted telecommunications services in Northeastern states on Tuesday, resulting in spotty coverage for cellphones, television, home telephones and Internet services. While all the region’s telecom service providers were having problems, Verizon Communications, which serves many of the states in the hurricane’s path, may have suffered some of the worst damage from the storm to its wireline network. About 25 percent of the region’s wireless cell towers were out of action after the storm and some 911 emergency call centers were not working, according to Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “Our assumption is that communications outages could get worse before they get better,” Genachowski told reporters on a conference call, noting that the storm had not ended. Also power outages could disrupt more cell sites if they run out of back-up power before commercial electricity services are up and running again. People lined up at pay-phones in at least one New York neighborhood, the Lower East Side, today as their phones had either lost coverage or they had run out of battery power because the re was nowhere t o charge their phones in the neighborhood which had lost commercial power. New York-based Verizon said the storm caused flooding at three Verizon central offices that hold telecom equipment in Lower Manhattan as well as sites in Queens and Long Island. Its downtown headquarters, which was put out of action 11 years ago by the September 11 attacks, had three feet of water in the lobby at one point. Because of flooding, all its telecom equipment at that office, which serves much of Wall Street and downtown consumers, was knocked out of service. The company said it was working on pumping out the water in the hope that it could restart its back-up power generators in the facility as commercial power services were not yet restored the morning after the big storm hit. “The bullseye of the impact is the metro area,” said spokesman William Kula, adding that restoring service for the city’s financial district was a top priority for Verizon. Telecom disruptions affect electronic trading as well as corporate operators. The chief operating officer of the New York Stock Exchange, which is expected to open Wednesday, said “lots of telecom infrastructure is down” and that the NYSE was working with big firms to ensure they were doing testing of their systems. Verizon did not give an estimate as to how many businesses and consumers were affected. Two of three Manhattan central offices were partially flooded and operating minimal services. Customers served by the damaged central offices will experience “a loss of all services” including TV, Internet, and traditional telephone services, Kula said. Some customers may experience intermittent busy signals for non-emergency calls. Verizon said its engineers were working on assessing the damage from the early hours. Outside of New York, the company warned that it was also having some trouble. “Verizon is discovering that many poles and power lines/Verizon cables are down throughout the region due to heavy winds and falling trees,” the company said in a statement. Verizon Wireless, AT&T; Inc, Sprint Nextel, and  T-Mobile USA said they were dealing with wireless service problems in the hurricane region. Cable operators Cablevision Systems Corp, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable also said they were having service problems. “I think everybody’s equipment’s going to be damaged,  including cellphone towers,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher King said from his Verizon Wireless cellphone in Baltimore. “Particularly for Verizon, they’re clearly going to have the most damage on the wireline side because its pretty much all of their territory (where the storm hit),” King said. Sprint Nextel, the No. 3 U.S. mobile provider said it was seeing outages at some cell sites because of the power outages across all the states in Sandy’s path including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Washington DC, Maryland, North Virginia and New England. “(Repair crews) have started on some critical areas but they haven’t been able to get to everywhere they need to be,” spokeswoman Crystal Davis said. She noted that 80 of the company’s stores would reopen at noon. Sprint had closed about 180 stores ahead of the storm. T-Mobile USA said that “customers may be experiencing service disruptions or an inability to access service in some areas, especially those that were hardest hit by the storm.” People complained of outages to their cable telephone, Internet and television services from providers including Comcast, Cablevision and Verizon in New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York. Cablevision said it was experiencing widespread service interruptions primarily related to loss of power. The company said it is working to restore services. Comcast, whose headquarters is in Philadelphia and serves East Coast states, said that for the majority of customers, “Comcast service should be restored as power comes back on to their homes.” Cellphone service was spotty for top wireless providers Verizon Wireless, AT&T; Inc and T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom, according to some customers. Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group, said on Tuesday afternoon that customers may be experiencing service issues and that about 94 percent of its cell sites were up and running. AT&T; said it was experiencing some issues in areas heavily affected by the storm. By Tuesday morning, spokesman Mark Siegel said AT&T; was in the initial stages of on-the-ground assessment and that it expected “crews will be working around the clock to restore service.” Several Time Warner Cable customers in Brooklyn said that their Internet, television and phone services stopped working Monday night but were back again by Tuesday morning. Time Warner Cable said that while it has not seen any major damage to its infrastructure, its customers who do not have electricity do not have cable services. Millions of people in the eastern United States awoke on Tuesday to flooded homes, fallen trees and widespread power outages caused by Sandy, which swamped New York City’s subway system and submerged streets in Manhattan’s financial district. At least 30 people were reported killed in the United States by one of the biggest storms to ever hit the country. Sandy dropped just below hurricane status before making landfall on Monday night in New Jersey.",10302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/storm-sandy-telecommunications/update-3-hurricane-sandy-disrupts-northeast-us-telecom-networks-idUSL1E8LUEFU20121030
316,CMCSA,"U.S. top court reviews Comcast, Amgen class actions","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court considered appeals by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) that could help determine what kind of evidence must be presented before companies may be the subject of class-action lawsuits. Monday’s complex arguments gave the court a new opportunity to further limit class actions, which can let large groups of plaintiffs seek larger recoveries at lower cost. Most recently, in June 2011 the court decertified a class of as many as 1.5 million Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) female workers who accused the world’s largest retailer of bias in pay and promotions, saying they raised too many different claims. In the Comcast case, subscribers led by Caroline Behrend had accused the largest U.S. cable TV company, which is also majority owner of NBC Universal, of overcharges that resulted from Comcast’s effort to monopolize the market in the Philadelphia area. The $875 million lawsuit was brought on behalf of a potential 2 million customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. Comcast said the subscribers were too different to sue as a class, but in August 2011 the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said a trial judge could decide whether they had a common methodology to justify awarding damages to a class. Miguel Estrada, a lawyer arguing for Comcast, called the subscribers’ model for determining damages “bunk,” adding that the certified class covered subscribers in 649 franchise areas facing different competitive conditions. “If you drop a stone in the water, you’re going to have ripples all the way out,” he said. “That doesn’t mean all the ripples are the same.” Justice Anthony Kennedy appeared sympathetic to Comcast. “The judge has to make a determination that in his view the class can be certified,” he said. “And that includes some factual inquiries as to the damages alleged.” But the main issue, as framed by the justices ahead of oral arguments, had been whether the trial judge could rely on testimony from an expert witness for the subscribers before certifying a class. The subscribers’ lawyer Barry Barnett and some justices on Monday suggested that Philadelphia-based Comcast could not press that issue because it had not done so in the lower courts, and that perhaps the Supreme Court should not rule on the company’s appeal. “Usually we decide cases based on disagreements about law, and here I can’t find one,” Justice Elena Kagan said. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested differently. “One option for the court, since we did reformulate the question, is to answer the question,” and then ask a lower court to decide whether Comcast had waived its right to address it. In the Amgen case, shareholders accused the Thousand Oaks California-based biotechnology company of fraudulently inflating its stock price between April 2004 and May 2007 by exaggerating the safety of its anti-anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen. Shareholders led by the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds sought class certification based on the “fraud on the market” theory endorsed by the Supreme Court in a 1988 case. This assumes that the price of a stock in an efficient market reflects all public information, and that a purchaser is presumed to have relied on the truthfulness of that information. Amgen said the shareholders should have been forced at the class certification stage, rather than at trial, to prove that alleged misstatements materially inflated the company’s stock price. But last November, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, let the class action proceed. Seth Waxman, a former U.S. solicitor general arguing for Amgen, told the court the shareholders cannot raise the fraud on the market theory without showing material misstatements. “Absent materiality, the market price cannot be presumed to reflect the statement in question,” he said. But Justice Antonin Scalia told the shareholders’ lawyer David Frederick there is “good reason” to decide the question of materiality before a class is certified. “The reason is the enormous pressure to settle once the class is certified,” he said. “In most cases, that’s the end of the lawsuit.” But Frederick noted that when Congress adopted a 1995 law to limit class-action lawsuits, it decided not to address the matter. “It’s not really for this court’s province to be imposing policy judgments about what additional requirements ought to be put on,” he said. “Congress made that judgment.” Comcast and Amgen were supported in their appeals by various business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as former commissioners and officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Decisions are expected by the end of June 2013. The cases are Comcast Corp et al v. Behrend et al, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 11-864; and Amgen Inc et al v.

322,CMCSA,TEXT - Fitch rates Comcast Corp notes 'BBB+',"Nov 29 - Fitch Ratings has assigned a ‘BBB+’ rating to Comcast Corporation’s  (Comcast) senior unsecured notes maturing 2061. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The notes will be guaranteed by Comcast’s subsidiaries included in the company’s cross-guaranty structure. The Rating Outlook for all of Comcast’s ratings is Stable. As of Sept. 30, 2012, Comcast had approximately $38.6 billion of debt outstanding, including $9.7 billion outstanding at NBCUniversal Media, LLC (NBCUniversal).  The issuance is in line with Comcast’s overall financial strategy and Fitch’s  expectations. Comcast’s leverage declined to 1.94x on a consolidated basis as of the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2012 when compared to 2.11x as of year-end 2011  and 2.35x for the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2011. The company is operating at  the lower end of Comcast’s leverage target ranging between 2x and 2.5x.  NBCUniversal’s leverage was 2.4x (2.9x pro forma for NBCUniversal’s $2 billion  issuance of senior notes during October 2012). Both leverage metrics are within  Fitch’s expectations given the current ratings. After considering NBCUniversal’s recent debt issuance, Fitch expects consolidated debt levels will remain  relatively constant during 2013. On a consolidated basis, Fitch anticipates  Comcast’s leverage metric will remain at the lower end of the company’s leverage target and approach 1.9x as of year-end 2013, while NBCUniversal’s leverage  metric will range between 2.5x and 2.75x by year-end 2013.      Fitch believes Comcast’s strong operating profile and solid free cash flow  metrics afford the company a high degree of financial flexibility at the current rating category. The company generated approximately $8.3 billion of  consolidated free cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities  less capital expenditures and dividends) during the LTM period ended Sept. 30,  2012. Fitch anticipates that the company will consistently generate consolidated free cash flow in excess of $7 billion annually after considering higher cash  taxes due to the absence of further economic stimulus legislation.  Fitch does not expect any material change to Comcast’s capital allocation  strategy over the near term. The company maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, repaying debt, and investing in the strategic needs of its  business. Cash generated from the cable business will be used to return cash to  Comcast shareholders while cash generated at NBCUniversal will build-up in  anticipation of obligations related to GE’s ownership put rights. Cash returned  to shareholders (dividends plus buybacks) totaled $3.4 billion or approximately  48% of cash flow before dividends during the first nine months of 2012. As of  Sept. 30, 2012 approximately $4.25 billion of capacity remains under Comcast’s  share repurchase authorization.   Comcast’s liquidity position and overall financial flexibility are strong owing  to Fitch’s expectation that the company will continue to generate material  amounts of free cash flow. Fitch acknowledges that Comcast’s share repurchase  program represents a significant use of cash; however, Fitch believes that the  company would reduce the level of share repurchases should the operating  environment materially change in order to maximize financial flexibility. The  liquidity position is further supported by cash on hand (which totaled $8.9  billion on a consolidated basis as of Sept. 30, 2012) and available borrowing  capacity from Comcast’s $6.25 billion revolver (of which approximately $5.8  billion was available for borrowing). Comcast’s revolver will expire during  June, 2017.   Comcast’s debt maturity profile on a consolidated basis is well laddered and  within Fitch’s free cash flow expectation for the company. Scheduled maturities  during 2013 total approximately $2.4 billion followed by $2 billion during 2014  including $907 million at NBCUniversal.   Fitch’s ratings incorporate Comcast’s strong competitive position as one of the  largest video, high-speed Internet and phone providers to residential and  business customers in the United States and the company’s compelling subscriber  clustering profile with operations in 39 states and the District of Columbia. In Fitch’s view, NBCUniversal’s size, scale, leading brand positions and diversity  of operations and business risk as one of the world’s most prominent media and  entertainment companies, lowers the business risk attributable to Comcast’s  credit profile and creates new avenues for revenue and cash flow growth while  limiting the near-term impact on Comcast’s balance sheet and credit profile.   What Could Trigger a Positive Rating Action:  —Positive rating action would likely coincide with Comcast committing to reduce leverage below 2x on a sustained basis after considering Comcast’s potential  funding obligations related to GE’s ownership put rights related to  NBCUniversal.   —Comcast would need to demonstrate that its operating profile will not  materially decline in the face of competition and poor housing and employment  conditions.   What Could Trigger a Negative Rating Action:  —Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretional actions  of Comcast’s management including, but not limited to, the company adopting a  more aggressive financial strategy or an event-driven merger, and acquisition  activity that drive leverage beyond 2.75x in the absence of a credible  de-leveraging plan.",11292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA022420121129
323,CMCSA,UPDATE 4-Sports fans can pursue US antitrust case over programs,"* Subscribers claimed to overpay for TV, Internet packages * Judge says subscribers plausibly alleged harm * MLB, NHL, Comcast, DirecTV, several teams were sued By Jonathan Stempel and Liana B. Baker NEW YORK, Dec 5 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday allowed sports fans to pursue a lawsuit accusing Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and various networks of antitrust violations in how they package games for broadcast on television or the Internet. U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan said the subscribers could pursue claims that the packaging has reduced competition, raised prices, and kept them from watching their favorite teams located outside their home markets. “Plaintiffs in this case - the consumers - have plausibly alleged that they are the direct victims of this harm,” she wrote. The defendants include Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, several teams in both sports, cable TV company Comcast Corp, satellite TV provider DirecTV, Madison Square Garden Co and some regional sports networks. DirecTV declined to comment, saying it had not reviewed the decision. Comcast and the NHL had no immediate comment. Other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ned Diver, a lawyer for the subscribers, said in a phone interview: “We’re very pleased with the decision. It’s a total victory on the substance of the plaintiffs’ claims.” Media companies, leagues and teams can often justify higher costs to watch their products by citing the higher costs of doing business, and that individual teams have rabid followings among viewers willing to pay more to watch events live. The case arose from what the subscribers said were anticompetitive “blackout” agreements between service providers such as Comcast and DirecTV, sports networks and the leagues. These subscribers contended that if they wanted to watch games from outside their home markets, they were required to buy packages that included all out-of-market games, even if they were interested only in one or a few nonlocal teams. For example, a New York Yankees fan living in Colorado could not pay simply for access to that team’s games, but had to buy a product such as the MLB Extra Innings television package. The subscribers sought damages and a halt to arrangements that they said resulted in “reduced output, diminished product quality, diminished choice and suppressed price competition.” Other packages at issue are NHL Center Ice for television, and MLB.tv and NHL GameCenter LIVE for the Internet. The defendants argued that the subscribers’ alleged injuries were only indirectly related to the alleged wrongful conduct, and that Major League Baseball and NHL games did not qualify as “distinct products” subject to antitrust scrutiny. Comcast, DirecTV and the sports networks also contended that their conduct was “presumptively legal.” Scheindlin nonetheless let much of the case go forward. “Making all games available as part of a package, while it may increase output overall, does not, as a matter of law, eliminate the harm to competition wrought by preventing the individual teams from competing to sell their games outside their home territories in the first place,” she wrote. The judge did dismiss claims that Comcast, DirecTV and the sports networks conspired to monopolize markets, while allowing similar claims against Major League Baseball and the NHL to proceed. She also dismissed some individual plaintiffs from the case, saying they lacked standing to sue. “There will be pressure on the defendants to settle before this gets to trial,” which could cost “real money,” said Geoffrey Rapp, a University of Toledo law professor in Ohio. “The defendants are in some ways similar to record companies that had to adapt as a la carte options became available online, where people could buy one song rather than a whole album,” he said. “Five or 10 years from now, these package-deal arrangements may no longer exist.” Among the dozens of defendants were the Yankees and its YES network; the Chicago White Sox baseball and Chicago Blackhawks hockey teams; the New York Rangers hockey team; and various Comcast SportsNet and Root Sports networks. Last month, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp said it would buy a 49 percent stake in the YES network. Baseball itself has had an antitrust exemption since 1922, but has long faced periodic calls from Congress and elsewhere that it be repealed. The cases are Laumann et al v. National Hockey League et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-01817; and Garber et al v. Office of the Commissioner of Baseball et al in the same court, No. 12-03074.",12052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/sports-antitrust-lawsuit/update-4-sports-fans-can-pursue-us-antitrust-case-over-programs-idUSL1E8N55WR20121205
324,CMCSA,Sprint in talks with major Clearwire investors: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N) is in talks with Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) to buy out their stakes in the U.S. wireless provider Clearwire Corp CLWR.O, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The No. 3 U.S. cellular company, which owns just over 50 percent in Clearwire, would still need buy out the rest of the minority shareholders in Clearwire to gain full ownership. Intel and Comcast own a combined basis roughly 12.4 percent of Clearwire’s total shares outstanding, including publicly traded stock and Class B shares, according to a Clearwire filing. Some minority Clearwire shareholders have publicly expressed concerns over a potential deal with Sprint, suggesting that Clearwire should look at other options. Those shareholders include Mount Kellet Capital Management LP - the No. 2 holder of Clearwire’s public shares with a 7.7 percent stake - and another top shareholder, Crest Financial Limited, which owns almost 7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Clearwire shares rose almost 12 percent on Tuesday after a CNBC report that Clearwire’s majority shareholder, Sprint, was moving closer to a deal to buy the rest of the company. Citing unnamed people close to the situation, CNBC said Sprint was in discussions to buy the 49 percent of Clearwire it does not already own and that a deal might be announced before the end of the year. Sprint, which wants full ownership of Clearwire’s wireless spectrum, has been in continuing negotiations with the company, but it is in no rush to finalize a deal, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Consolidating the two companies’ balance sheets could risk delaying the closing of Sprint’s $20.1 billion deal with Softbank, a separate source close to the matter said. While the timing of a Clearwire takeover is unclear, it had been planned for around the middle of next year, one of the people had said. The people requested anonymity because the matter is not public. Sprint, Clearwire, Intel and Comcast all declined to comment. Clearwire, whose biggest customer is also Sprint, has been looking to raise new financing as it could run out of money by the end of the third quarter of 2013. Clearwire is also under pressure to move ahead with an upgrade of its network for high-speed wireless services. CNBC reported that Sprint had been in talks in recent days with other Clearwire shareholders, which include Bright House, Intel and Comcast, to buy their shares of the company at about $3.00 each. The report said that Sprint’s offer price for the 488 million shares that are held by the public remained unclear. Sprint has increased its ownership of Clearwire to 50.45 percent with the purchase of Eagle River Holdings’ stake, which closed on Tuesday.

328,CMCSA,TEXT - Fitch rates Comcast Corp snr unsecured notes BBB-plus,"Jan 8 - Fitch Ratings has assigned a ‘BBB+’ rating to Comcast Corporation’s  (Comcast) benchmark size, senior unsecured notes maturing 2023, 2033 and 2043. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The notes will be guaranteed by Comcast’s subsidiaries included in the company’s cross guaranty structure. The rating Outlook for all of Comcast’s ratings is Stable. As of Sept. 30, 2012 Comcast had approximately $38.6 billion of debt outstanding, including $9.7 billion outstanding at NBCUniversal Media, LLC (NBCUniversal).  The issuance is in line with Comcast’s overall financial strategy and Fitch’s  expectations. Comcast’s leverage declined to 1.94x on a consolidated basis as of the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2012 when compared to 2.11x as of year-end 2011  and 2.35x for the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2011. The company is operating at  the lower end of Comcast’s leverage target ranging between 2x and 2.5x.  NBCUniversal’s leverage was 2.4x (2.9x pro forma for NBCUniversal’s $2 billion  issuance of senior notes during October 2012). Both leverage metrics are within  Fitch’s expectations given the current ratings. After considering the recent  debt issuance, Fitch expects consolidated debt levels will remain relatively  constant during 2013. On a consolidated basis, Fitch anticipates Comcast’s  leverage metric will remain at the lower end of the company’s leverage target  and approach 1.9x as of year-end 2013, while NBCUniversal’s leverage metric will range between 2.5x and 2.75x by year-end 2013.    Fitch believes Comcast’s strong operating profile and solid free cash flow  metrics afford the company a high degree of financial flexibility at the current rating category. The company generated approximately $8.3 billion of  consolidated free cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities  less capital expenditures and dividends) during the LTM period ended Sept. 30,  2012. Fitch anticipates that the company will consistently generate consolidated free cash flow in excess of $7 billion annually.  Fitch does not expect any material change to Comcast’s capital allocation  strategy over the near term. The company maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, repaying debt, and investing in the strategic needs of its  business. Cash generated from the cable business will be used to return cash to  Comcast shareholders while cash generated at NBCUniversal will build-up in  anticipation of obligations related to GE’s ownership put rights. Cash returned  to shareholders (dividends plus buybacks) totaled $3.4 billion or approximately  48% of cash flow before dividends during the first nine months of 2012. As of  Sept. 30, 2012 approximately $4.25 billion of capacity remains under Comcast’s  share repurchase authorization.   Comcast’s liquidity position and overall financial flexibility are strong owing  to Fitch’s expectation that the company will continue to generate material  amounts of free cash flow. Fitch acknowledges that Comcast’s share repurchase  program represents a significant use of cash; however, Fitch believes that the  company would reduce the level of share repurchases should the operating  environment materially change in order to maximize financial flexibility. The  liquidity position if further supported by cash on hand (which totaled $8.9  billion on a consolidated basis as of Sept. 30, 2012) and available borrowing  capacity from Comcast’s $6.25 billion revolver (of which approximately $5.8  billion was available for borrowing). Comcast’s revolver will expire during June 2017.   Comcast’s debt maturity profile on a consolidated basis is well laddered and  within Fitch’s FCF expectation for the company. Scheduled maturities during 2013 total approximately $2.4 billion followed by $2 billion during 2014 including  $907 million at NBCUniversal.   Fitch’s ratings incorporate Comcast’s strong competitive position as one of the  largest video, high speed internet and phone providers to residential and  business customers in the United States and the company’s compelling subscriber  clustering profile with operations in 39 states and the District of Columbia. In Fitch’s view NBCUniversal’s size, scale, leading brand positions and diversity  of operations and business risk as one of the world’s most prominent media and  entertainment companies, lowers the business risk attributable to Comcast’s  credit profile and creates new avenues for revenue and cash flow growth while  limiting the near-term impact on Comcast’s balance sheet and credit profile.

What Could Trigger a Negative Rating Action:  —Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretional actions  of Comcast’s management including, but not limited to the company adopting a  more aggressive financial strategy or an event driven merger and acquisition  activity, that drive leverage beyond 2.75x in the absence of a credible  de-leveraging plan.",1082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNB284220130108

331,CMCSA,GE to sell rest of NBC stake to Comcast for $16.7 billion,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp on Tuesday said it would buy General Electric’s remaining 49 percent equity stake in their NBCUniversal joint venture for about $16.7 billion, speeding up a deal that had not been expected until at least late 2014. Analysts said Comcast was getting a good deal at that price, while Comcast’s chief executive said the company moved because it was eager to take control of the business sooner than planned. Comcast shares rose 7.5 percent in afterhours trading. Comcast bought 51 percent of NBC Universal in 2011 after winning antitrust approval from the Justice Department. The transaction created a $30 billion business that includes broadcast, cable networks, movie studios and theme parks. “Pretty much in our opinion given that media stocks have gone up quite a bit, it’s a very attractive price, a fair price because we had a formula buyout,” Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Roberts said in an interview with Reuters. “We feel many good things coming today and in the future and we wanted to get 100 percent of that for our shareholders.” In addition to the main deal, NBCUniversal will also buy from GE Capital the properties it uses at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City and CNBC’s headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, for about $1.4 billion. Comcast said it would fund the deal with $11.4 billion of cash on hand, $4 billion in senior unsecured notes to be issued to GE, $2 billion in credit facility borrowings and the issuance of $725 million in subsidiary preferred stock to GE. Separately, Comcast said it would increase its dividend by 20 percent and that it would buy back $2 billion in stock this year. GE also said it would accelerate its own share buy-back program to $10 billion this year. “It’s an attractive price - Comcast is getting a good deal,” Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said. LONG-HELD AMBITIONS Comcast turned its attention to NBC after a failed $54 billion hostile takeover attempt of Disney in 2004 that ultimately led to the resignation of that company’s CEO, Michael Eisner, after more than 20 years on the job. The hostile offer exposed Comcast’s desire to merge content with distribution at a time when most of its industry peers, such as Viacom-CBS and AOL-Time Warner, were doing the opposite. While Comcast held the title of the nation’s leading cable operator by a wide margin, its status as a content player was always second tier, with middling networks like E!, G4 and Golf forming the basis of its channel portfolio. The NBC deal gave the Philadelphia-based cable operator the cable industry’s top-rated entertainment network, USA, its leading business network CNBC, upstart news network MSNBC and Bravo, among others. For GE, the sale culminates a long-planned exit from the entertainment business. Since reaching the deal to sell its majority stake in NBC Universal, GE officials have made clear that they eventually planned to exit the entertainment business entirely. The initial sale contract gave GE the option to sell back as much as all its remaining stake in NBC Universal by mid-2014. The company’s accelerated share buyback could be an answer to shareholders, who have wondered what GE would do with a cash windfall that could total tens of billions of dollars over several years, as the company sold its remaining NBC stake and recouped more profits earned by GE Capital. In addition to the GE deal, Comcast reported fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. It posted $15.94 billion in revenue, up 6 percent from a year ago. It posted net income of $1.8 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.56 billion, or 47 cents a year ago. In its cable business, it lost a net 7,000 video customers, which is better than the 17,000 subscribers lost a year ago. Wall Street analysts were expecting Comcast to lose 5,000 customers, according to StreetAccount. It added 341,000 Internet customers in the quarter, which beat the 329,000 new customers analysts were expecting. Comcast shares rose to $41.89 after the market close from $38.97 in regular trading. GE shares rose 3 percent to $23.37 from a $22.58 close. ",2122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-nbc/ge-to-sell-rest-of-nbc-stake-to-comcast-for-16-7-billion-idUSBRE91B1IM20130212

338,CMCSA,Comcast and Fox strike up new distribution deal,"(Reuters) - Cable provider Comcast Corp and News Corp’s Fox Networks have struck up a distribution agreement to carry Fox’s programming on televisions, computers, smartphones and tablets to Comcast’s 22 million Xfinity customers. Terms of the deal, announced on Tuesday, were not disclosed. Xfinity is Comcast’s cable service that lets customers view TV on demand and access it through devices such as smartphones and tablets. The agreement includes live and on-demand shows from Fox’s 20 broadcast stations, FX, Fox Soccer, and the Fox Business Network among others. One of the key aspects include the ability to make Fox’s programming available the next day to Xfinity customers however they choose to access it - be it on a smartphone or tablet - in a program that is known in the industry as “TV Everywhere.” Media conglomerates including CBS and Time Warner Inc have seen additional revenue as they make TV programs and movies available through cable providers’ TV Everywhere initiatives as well as other streaming media offerings from Amazon and Netflix.

343,CMCSA,Comcast sees growth from NBCUniversal stronger than anticipated,"(Reuters) - Stronger-than-expected growth in NBCUniversal’s entertainment unit gave Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) the impetus to buy the rest of the company from General Electric Co (GE.N) two years earlier than expected. “NBCUniversal’s 2012 results highlight in particular the improving performance of our broadcast businesses,” Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Roberts said in a call with analysts. “NBC’s prime time performance this fall has been improving. “While we recognize it is early in the turnaround, this is driving a big swing in momentum which should continue to help the network.” NBCUniversal’s cable networks, such as the Golf Channel, E! and Bravo among others, rose 3.3 percent to $8.77 billion last year. Cable networks have become the main growth driver in the last few years for the industry. Roberts said the numbers made an even stronger case for buying out GE’s 49 percent stake for $16.7 billion. The deal values NBCUniversal at $39 billion. Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, who owns 273,000 of Comcast said he liked the deal because Comcast will be able to make money on NBC’s programming as new ways to watch content emerge. “There is a myriad of distribution systems that will pay for NBC content in the future,” he said. Comcast said NBCUniversal’s total revenue last year rose 13 percent to $23.81 billion. Its broadcast TV network, NBC, a long-time industry laggard, saw the biggest revenue growth, gaining 27.4 percent to $8.15 billion on the strength of popular television events such as the Olympics and the 2012 Super Bowl. Comcast shares touched a multi-year high of $42 on the Nasdaq, before falling back to $39.99 in later afternoon trade, still up 2.6 percent from Tuesday’s close. Marrying Comcast’s more than 22 million cable subscribers with its own and NBCUniversal’s content assets is how the company “strategically differentiates” itself from its competitors, Roberts said. Its rivals Viacom (VIAB.O) and Time Warner (TWX.N), separate content from distribution. NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke, a longtime confidante of Roberts, has targeted the Universal Studios theme parks as a rich vein to tap for both growth and investment. Burke, who once ran EuroDisney, cited theme parks as a major area of growth in 2013. For the second year in a row, Comcast said it would boost its capital investment plan at NBCUniversal, aiming for a 25 percent increase with a big chunk of that pledged to new theme park attractions. Comcast plans to bring its “Harry Potter” attraction to Hollywood, for instance, taking aim at Disney’s (DIS.N) core market. Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan estimates that Comcast invested $155 million in theme parks last year. “The parks are doing fabulously,” said Harrigan. “They were the poor cousin of Disney but not anymore.” Harrigan called NBCUniversal a “work in progress” that was still stabilizing. While he agrees that NBCUniversal is headed in the right direction, he said the Universal studio’s full-year operating cash flow in 2012 was underwhelming at $79 million, up from $24 million in 2011. In addition to the parks, Burke also spotlighted for growth affiliate fees for NBC’s cable networks, fees that pay-TV operators give to programmers to distribute their networks, and retransmission consent fees, or payments made to air a network’s broadcast signal. He also said that the rate advertisers pay for commercials on NBCUniversal properties is lower than rivals with weaker ratings and could also improve this year. Comcast, which ranks as the nation’s largest pay-TV operators and still receives the majority of its revenue from its core cable systems business, said it would invest 10 percent more in cable capital expenditures in a bid to increase Internet speeds. As with most cable companies, its cable unit’s growth is coming largely from its Internet service. Last year, it added 1.2 million Internet customers while it lost 336,000 video customers. The cable business’ programming costs should rise in the low double digits this year, Comcast said. Comcast signed a new distribution agreement with Fox on Tuesday for an undisclosed sum that includes the rights for live and on-demand shows, as well as access to Fox’s programs on mobile devices.

345,CMCSA,"US STOCKS-Wall St rally stalls, S&P; 500 skims November 2007 high","* S&P; 500 hits highest intraday level since Nov 1, 2007 * Obama urges $50 billion infrastructure spending * Comcast jumps on news it will buy rest of NBC Universal * Indexes: Dow down 0.3 pct; S&P; flat; Nasdaq up 0.2 pct By Angela Moon NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday amid investor caution after the S&P; 500 index briefly hit its highest intraday level since November 2007. The benchmark index got a boost from Comcast Corp, which said it will buy the rest of NBC Universal for $16.7 billion from General Electric Co. Equities have been strong performers until recently, buoyed largely by healthy growth in corporate earnings, which helped the S&P; 500 to rise 6.5 percent so far this year. The Dow industrials are about 1 percent away from an all-time intraday high, reached in October 2007. Those gains have left the market vulnerable to a pullback as investors are likely to take profit amid a dearth of new catalysts. While analysts see an upward bias in stocks, recent daily moves have been small and trading volumes light with indexes at multi-year highs. “I was expecting a 12-15 percent return on the S&P; for the whole year of 2013, and we have done about half of that in just 5-6 weeks,” said Jack De Gan, principal at Harbor Advisory in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. “We will hit resistance, but the fundamentals and (microeconomic) picture are looking good, so if there is a correction, it’s going to be a brief one.” The Dow Jones industrial average was down 39.17 points, or 0.28 percent, at 13,979.53. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 0.80 points, or 0.05 percent, at 1,520.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 7.01 points, or 0.22 percent, at 3,193.50. Investors shrugged off the latest economic data, which showed that retail sales rose just 0.1 percent, as expected, in January as tax increases and higher gasoline prices restrained spending. The S&P; 500 was well above its 50-day moving average of 1,460.92, a sign the market could be overbought. Comcast agreed late Tuesday to buy General Electric Co’s  remaining 49 percent stake in NBC Universal for $16.7 billion. Comcast jumped 4.4 percent to $40.70 as the S&P;’s top percentage gainer while Dow component GE was up 3.3 percent to $23.33. Deere & Co reported earnings that beat expectations and raised its full-year profit outlook. After initially rallying in premarket trading, the stock fell 3 percent to $91.13. According to the latest Thomson Reuters data, of the 353 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported results, 70.3 percent have exceeded analysts’ expectations, above a 62 percent average since 1994 and 65 percent over the past four quarters. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P; 500 companies are estimated to have risen 5.3 percent, according to the data, above a 1.9 percent forecast at the start of the earnings season.

Baker and Peter Lauria Feb 12 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp clinched full control of NBC Universal for $16.7 billion on Tuesday, the latest in a series of deals that have taken the cable operator from humble roots in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Manhattan’s iconic Rockerfeller Center. The nation’s largest cable operator unveiled plans on Tuesday to buy out General Electric Co’s remaining 49 percent stake in the NBC Universal joint venture. That gives it full control of one of the industry’s largest and most profitable stable of cable networks, as well as the NBC broadcast network with its recognizable peacock logo. Combining properties such as USA Network, Universal Studios and more than 22 million cable subscribers, the deal completes a 50-year transformation for Comcast, which was founded by Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts’ father, Ralph, in 1963. Comcast bought 51 percent of NBC Universal in 2011 after winning antitrust approval from the Justice Department. Tuesday’s deal comes at least two years sooner than planned and creates a $39 billion business owed primarily to the success of marrying cable distribution with cable programming. The rational behind the deal differentiates Comcast from rivals such as Time Warner Cable Inc, which separated content from distribution. “The reality is content has gotten stronger and stronger and safer and safer, so Comcast should be trading at a premium to the cable operators. They are an integrated media and entertainment company. They are not just a cable operator,” said John Tinker, an analyst at Maxim Group. In addition to the main deal, which pushed up Comcast shares about 7 percent in after hours trading, Comcast will also gain full control of the floors NBC uses at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City and CNBC’s headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, for about $1.4 billion. Comcast said it would fund the deal with $11.4 billion of cash on hand, $4 billion in senior unsecured notes to be issued to GE, $2 billion in credit facility borrowings and the issuance of $725 million in subsidiary preferred stock to GE. “Given that media stocks have gone up quite a bit, it’s a very attractive price, a fair price because we had a formula buyout,” Roberts, who is also chairman of the company, said in an interview with Reuters. Separately, Comcast said it would increase its dividend by 20 percent and it would buy back $2 billion in stock this year. GE also said it would accelerate its own share buy-back program to $10 billion this year. “People may have their own opinions on whether it’s good or bad strategically, but it doesn’t leave any unanswered questions financially. For a transaction of this nature and this size, it’s a relatively low-risk structure,” Brean Capital analyst Todd Mitchell said. Since reaching the deal to sell its majority stake in NBC Universal, GE officials have made clear they eventually planned to exit the entertainment business entirely. So the moves announced on Tuesday culminate a long-planned exit from the entertainment business. Comcast shares rose to $41.75 after the market close from  $38.97 in regular trading. LONG-HELD AMBITIONS Comcast turned its attention to NBC after a failed $54 billion hostile takeover attempt of Walt Disney Co in 2004 that ultimately led to the resignation of that company’s CEO, Michael Eisner, after more than 20 years on the job. While Comcast held the title of the nation’s leading cable operator by a wide margin, its status as a content player was always second tier, with middling networks such as E!, G4 and Golf forming the basis of its channel portfolio. A source familiar with the situation said talks accelerated in July 2012 when NBC Universal sold its stake in A&E; Television Networks for $3 billion. Comcast and GE were debating how to use the proceeds, with Comcast wanting to keep the cash in the company while GE wanted a dividend. When it first bought NBC Universal, Comcast tread lightly, in part to smooth the way for regulatory approval. Among the concessions it offered to help seal the original deal was to adopt a hands-off policy towards the news division to ensure its independence, ensure diversity by agreeing to carry networks aimed at minority audiences and remove itself from management decisions regarding online video site Hulu. Comcast owns a passive stake in Hulu, with News Corp and Disney controlling the website’s management. Comcast also agreed to ‘net neutrality’ provisions to ensure traffic to competitor websites was not interfered with and to make NBC’s programming available to other cable and satellite TV distributors on equal terms. Because the Justice Department looked at the 2011 transaction, this one would not need to be investigated, said Richard Brosnick, an antitrust expert with law firm Butzel Long. “The only way that the government would look further at this is if Comcast violated its consent decree,” said Brosnick. A source close to Comcast said the company did not anticipate it would be required to file for antitrust approval with either the Justice Department or the Federal Communications Commission. Comcast has slowly but steadily replaced NBC’s former regime with its own people since closing the deal. Steve Burke, the longtime top lieutenant to Roberts at Comcast, runs NBC Universal. Former CEO Jeff Zucker is gone. So too is former NBC Entertainment chief Jeff Gaspin and longtime sports producer Dick Ebersol, among others. In February, Steve Capus announced he was leaving as head of NBC News. That decision, according to sources, was motivated in part by Comcast’s installing one its executives, Patricia Fili-Krushel, into the newly created position of chairman of NBC Universal News Group and making Capus, along with CNBC president Mark Hoffman and MSNBC president Phil Griffin, report to her. Indeed, the only executives that still remain from the old regime are the leaders of cable networks and Universal Studios head Ron Meyer, who ranks as the longest-serving movie studio chief in Hollywood. On the cable side, in addition to Hoffman and Griffin, Bonnie Hammer now runs all of NBC’s entertainment-oriented cable networks and Lauren Zalaznick leads its digital operations. Bob Greenblatt, the former head of Showtime, now runs the NBC broadcast network and Mark Lazarus leads the sports division. In addition to the GE deal, Comcast reported a 6 percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. In its cable business, it lost a better-than-expected 7,000 net video customers. For the fourth quarter, NBC Universal’s revenue rose 5 percent to $6.01 billion. Morgan Stanley served as Comcast’s financial adviser and Davis Polk & Wardell was its legal adviser. J.P. Morgan was financial adviser to GE and Weil, Gotshal & Manges was the legal adviser.    (Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston, Jennifer Saba in New York, Diane Bartz in Washington and A.

350,CMCSA,"Court grills FCC, Tennis Channel in Comcast discrimination suit","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Court of Appeals judges on Monday hit hard against the Federal Communications Commission and Tennis Channel in a case alleging Comcast Corp discriminated against the sports network, even raising the possibility of rendering the entire case moot because it might have been filed too late. A three-judge panel raised a number of technical concerns with the arguments of the regulator and the sports channel - including an underpinning one of timing - as it weighs whether Comcast can be required to distribute the network to as many subscribers as it does its own affiliated sports channels. In what Comcast has called “dramatic regulatory overreach,” the FCC in 2012 sided with Tennis Channel and an administrative law judge, ruling that the top U.S. cable operator unfairly placed the channel in a more expensive and thus less-watched tier than its own Golf Channel and NBC Sports Network. The rule, reached by a 3-2 commission vote along party lines, required Comcast to put Tennis Channel on par with its own sports network. It was the first time a cable network prevailed over a cable operator under the FCC’s 1993 federal anti-discrimination program carriage rules. Comcast has argued that the FCC’s requirement infringed upon its freedom of editorial judgment and freedom of speech, but Judge Harry Edwards repeatedly brought the conversation back to the question whether Tennis Channel’s complaint came too late. “You can’t come up at any time eight or 10 years later and say, ‘You know what, I hate the contract,” Edwards said. Tennis Channel filed its complaint with the FCC in 2010 after signing the contract with Comcast in 2005. Comcast said the contract stipulated the placement, and an old FCC rule limited timing of disputes of such agreements to one year. The FCC said the timing was fair because the complaint came within a year of notifying Comcast of its intent to do so as well as Comcast turning down the request to be moved to a higher viewing tier. “If you are essentially upset about the contract, too bad,” Edwards said, calling the regulator’s new interpretation of its own statute of limitations “ridiculous.” Tennis Channel argues that an earlier complaint would have been “premature” because at the time it could not have been compared to the popular Golf Channel and Versus sports networks. But in late 2008 it gained rights to the U.S. Open and high-definition ability, making it more competitive. A lower tier, it now says, deprives it of advertising revenue and higher per-subscriber fees collected from Comcast for content. Judge Stephen Williams raised concerns about the unclear financial implications of requiring Comcast to move Tennis Channel as the FCC and the network say that Comcast weighed the costs of having Tennis Channel in a higher viewing tier but did not adequately analyze the benefits. Comcast argues that it did, and found none. Judge Brett Kavanaugh delved more into the question of freedom of speech. The U.S. Congress differentiates how much regulatory power can be wielded over companies that can dictate market prices and those that cannot, and Kavanaugh said so-called “non-market powers” could not be forced to “carry the speech they don’t like.” That aligned with the arguments of Comcast’s lawyer, Miguel Estrada. “If there’s no market power consideration, I am entitled under the First Amendment to like my speech better than yours,” he said. As long as the case remains outside of the arguments about Comcast being such a market power, Kavanaugh said that forcing the cable operator to change how they treat Tennis Channel “seems contrary to our traditions.” The court is expected to decide in the next few months based on Monday’s arguments and written briefs submitted earlier.

351,CMCSA,"Court grills FCC, Tennis Channel in Comcast discrimination suit","WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Court of Appeals judges on Monday hit hard against the Federal Communications Commission and Tennis Channel in a case alleging Comcast Corp  discriminated against the sports network, even raising the possibility of rendering the entire case moot because it might have been filed too late. A three-judge panel raised a number of technical concerns with the arguments of the regulator and the sports channel - including an underpinning one of timing - as it weighs whether Comcast can be required to distribute the network to as many subscribers as it does its own affiliated sports channels. In what Comcast has called “dramatic regulatory overreach,” the FCC in 2012 sided with Tennis Channel and an administrative law judge, ruling that the top U.S. cable operator unfairly placed the channel in a more expensive and thus less-watched tier than its own Golf Channel and NBC Sports Network. The rule, reached by a 3-2 commission vote along party lines, required Comcast to put Tennis Channel on par with its own sports network. It was the first time a cable network prevailed over a cable operator under the FCC’s 1993 federal anti-discrimination program carriage rules.

353,CMCSA,UPDATE 3-U.S. Supreme Court rules for Comcast in class action,"* Comcast accused of overcharging cable TV subscribers * In 5-4 vote, court says class was improperly certified By Jonathan Stempel March 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in favor of Comcast Corp in a case over how much it charged a group of cable TV subscribers, the latest blow against consumers hoping to pursue class action lawsuits. In a 5-4 decision, the court said 2 million subscribers in the Philadelphia area could not sue Comcast as a group. These subscribers claimed in an antitrust lawsuit that the largest U.S. cable TV company overcharged them as part of an effort to monopolize the market. But Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority that the subscribers fell “far short” of establishing that damages could be accurately measured for the entire group. He said the proposed class was too diverse in the claims they raised and in where they lived, causing individual damages calculations to “overwhelm” issues common to everyone. Wednesday’s decision overturned an August 2011 ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Comcast’s hometown of Philadelphia, which had allowed the class action to go forward. It came nearly two years after the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Wal-Mart Stores Inc v. Dukes, which threw out a giant gender discrimination lawsuit because the employees had too little in common to sue together. Wal-Mart came just two months after the court in AT&T; Mobility v. Concepcion upheld contracts that required customers to arbitrate disputes individually, not as a class. “The court is building on Dukes by limiting class actions in the commercial area,” said Michael Waterstone, an associate dean at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who is not involved in the Comcast case. “It will make it harder for groups of people with small claims against large corporate defendants to bring class claims for damages.” Barry Barnett, a lawyer for the subscribers, said he is reviewing the decision. Comcast spokeswoman Jenni Moyer said the company was pleased with the decision. Several business and conservative groups, as well as chipmaker Intel Corp, supported Comcast’s appeal. Comcast shares rose 16 cents to $41.63 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. In their $875 million lawsuit, Caroline Behrend and other cable TV subscribers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware said Comcast was able to stifle competition through a successful strategy of buying rivals or swapping coverage areas. They said this enabled the company to triple market share, which peaked at 77.8 percent in 2002. Comcast countered that the subscribers should not be allowed to sue together, saying they hailed from 649 franchise areas facing different competitive conditions. The trial court accepted only one of the subscribers’ four theories of antitrust liability: that Comcast’s activity reduced competition from “overbuilders” that build networks in areas where incumbent providers already operate. But it said damages could be determined classwide on that theory, relying on a statistician hired by the subscribers who compared actual cable TV prices with hypothetical prices that he said would have prevailed absent any anticompetitive activity. The 3rd Circuit agreed that the trial court could find a common methodology to justify awarding damages to a class. But Scalia wrote that by focusing on damages, the 3rd Circuit ignored precedents requiring that it examine whether “common questions” among class members predominate. “There is no question that the model failed to measure damages resulting from the particular antitrust injury on which (Comcast’s) liability in this action is premised,” Scalia wrote. Cory Andrews, a lawyer at the Washington Legal Foundation who wrote a brief supporting Comcast, said: “The idea behind a class action is that it’s more efficient to litigate many cases at once, but the court is saying we’re not going to a certify a class absent evidence it is worthy of certification.” Wednesday’s vote breakdown was a familiar one, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito joining Scalia’s opinion. The more liberal justices dissented, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer penning an unusual joint dissent, joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Ginsburg and Breyer said they would have dismissed the appeal, saying the court erred in reformulating the case to focus on issues that Comcast had not pressed in lower courts and which the subscribers did not have a fair chance to address. The dissent also said the court erred in overturning factual findings made by two lower courts over whether the subscribers’ damages model was legitimate. Joshua Davis, a University of San Francisco law professor who worked on a brief supporting the subscribers, said the court decision would tend to benefit “large corporations with strong market power,” whlie hurting smaller businesses and consumers. “Class certification is often crucial for private plaintiffs because it’s too expensive to litigate individually,” he said. The Supreme Court has not always ruled for businesses in recent class action cases. Last month, the court let shareholders of Amgen Inc  sue the biotechnology company as a group without first having to show that misinformation had materially and fraudulently inflated its stock price. Decisions in other class action cases are also coming up. In February, the court heard arguments on whether American Express Co could force merchants into arbitration to litigate an antitrust claim, rather than allow a class action lawsuit, as a condition of accepting its charge cards. And on Monday, the court considered whether doctors may collectively arbitrate a payments dispute with Oxford Health Plans LLC, though the governing agreement did not mention class actions.

354,CMCSA,Supreme Court rules for Comcast in class action,"(Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in favor of Comcast Corp in an antitrust case over how much it charged cable TV subscribers, further curtailing the ability of people to pursue class action lawsuits. In a 5-4 decision, the court said a group of cable TV subscribers in the Philadelphia area who accused Comcast of overcharging them as part of an effort to monopolize the market could not sue as a group. “The permutations involving four theories of liability and 2 million subscribers located in 16 counties are nearly endless,” Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority. Comcast’s subscribers fell “far short of establishing that damages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis,” he continued. “There is no question that the model failed to measure damages resulting from the particular antitrust injury on which (Comcast’s) liability in this action is premised.” Wednesday’s decision came in one of several class action cases being addressed this term by a court whose recent decision-making is often considered friendly to businesses and unfriendly to consumers. They follow a landmark 2011 decision in Wal-Mart Stores Inc v. Dukes where the court threw out a giant employment discrimination lawsuit because the female plaintiffs did not have enough in common to sue together. Wednesday’s vote breakdown was a familiar one, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito joining Scalia’s opinion. The more liberal justices dissented, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer penning an unusual joint dissent, joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Comcast did not immediately comment, saying its lawyers were reviewing the decision. Barry Barnett, a lawyer for the subscribers, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While not as sweeping as the Wal-Mart ruling, the Comcast decision addressed a key issue in class action litigation: what kind of evidence must be presented in the early stages of a case before a judge can allow a class action to go forward. Led by Caroline Behrend, subscribers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware in an $875 million lawsuit dating from 2003 accused the largest cable TV company of overcharges through its effort to monopolize the Philadelphia area market. The subscribers said that by buying rivals or swapping coverage areas, Philadelphia-based Comcast was able to triple its market share, which peaked at 77.8 percent in 2002. Comcast said the case was too big, covering subscribers in 649 franchise areas facing different competitive conditions. In August 2011, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said a trial judge could decide the subscribers had a common methodology to justify awarding damages to a class. But in reversing that ruling, Scalia said that in focusing on damages, the 3rd Circuit failed to do what Supreme Court precedents require: examine whether “common questions” among class members predominate over individual questions. “By refusing to entertain arguments against (subscribers’) damages model that bore on the propriety of class certification, simply because those arguments would also be pertinent to the merits determination, the Court of Appeals ran afoul of our precedents requiring precisely that inquiry,” Scalia wrote. Ginsburg and Breyer said they would have dismissed the appeal, saying the court erred in reformulating the case to focus on issues that Comcast had not pressed in lower courts and which the subscribers did not have a fair chance to address. The dissent also said the court erred in overturning factual findings made by two lower courts over whether the subscribers’ damages model was legitimate.

356,CMCSA,Supreme Court sends back lawsuit on washing machines,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday wiped out an appeals court ruling in favor of consumers who bought front-loading washing machines made by Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N). The court said the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision endorsing a group lawsuit, known as class action certification, had to be reconsidered in light of the Supreme Court’s 5-4 ruling last week in another consumer case involving Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O). The class action lawsuit against Whirlpool said that the high-efficiency washers were defective because they emitted unpleasant odors. In the Comcast case, the court ruled in favor of the cable company over how much it charged a group of cable TV subscribers. The court said 2 million subscribers in the Philadelphia area could not sue Comcast as a group. Whirlpool’s lawyers, in a petition seeking high court review, said that the case would also affect similar claims against the company and other manufacturers, including General Electric Co (GE.N) and Sears (SHLD.O). Jonathan Selbin, a lawyer representing consumers in the litigation, said he viewed the Supreme Court’s decision as a victory because the justices declined to hear oral arguments and rule on Whirlpool’s petition. He said he is “cautiously optimistic” that the appeals court will find that the Comcast ruling will not have an impact on how the case comes out the second time around. Whirlpool did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

360,CMCSA,WRAPUP 2-Major media companies top estimates in shaky ad market,"* All three shy of revenue expectations * TV advertising seen as key to results * Viacom, Comcast shares up; Time Warner off By Jennifer Saba and Liana B. Baker May 1 (Reuters) - Some of the biggest U.S. media conglomerates beat earnings expectations on Wednesday, though Time Warner Inc, Viacom Inc and Comcast Corp all found their television businesses under scrutiny in a tough advertising market. Time Warner posted a profit that topped even the most optimistic Wall Street estimate by 4 cents, and Comcast  and Viacom both beat expectations by one penny. But all three were just shy of revenue expectations. Even though they operate a range of businesses outside of TV, investors focused on ad performance because it is a key revenue source for media companies. “That advertising number is the first thing people look at when they look at the earnings release,” said Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities. Viacom’s stock got the strongest lift from its results, with shares rising 3.7 percent to $66.33 in afternoon trading, after touching a new multiyear high earlier in the session. The company reported a 6 percent drop in revenue because of a weak slate of movies from its studio Paramount Pictures, but advertising revenue turned positive during the quarter. Its cable network properties, including MTV and  Nickelodeon, posted a 2 percent rise in advertising revenue in the United States. Viacom has been struggling with a decline in TV ratings, which are the currency for commercials. The children’s network Nickelodeon in particular was a drag. “Viacom had ratings pressure for a long time, so it’s significant that they have turned the corner in terms of ad growth, which is now positive instead of negative,” said Brett Harriss, an analyst with Gabelli & Co. For Time Warner, on the other hand, first-quarter ad revenue at cable properties including TNT and news channel CNN fell 1 percent. UBS analyst John Janedis said in a note to clients he thinks it had to do with weak ad rates and what he characterized as “slow demand.” Part of the decline had to do with the timing of the 2013 NCAA college basketball tournament, a huge TV draw that partially slipped into a different quarter. But ratings also fell, with Evercore Partners estimating a decline of 4 percent for Time Warner’s cable networks in the quarter. The company said second-quarter ad revenue at its networks will be up in the high single digits in percentage terms. Time Warner shares fell 1.1 percent to $59.12, recouping some of their earlier losses. Comcast, which unlike the other two companies combines media properties with a cable television system, benefited more from cable than from its media unit. The company lost more video customers than expected but gained more Internet subscribers than estimated. On the other hand, operating cash flow at NBC Universal was a negative $35 million, much worse than a year earlier. Revenue at NBC also fell because the network did not have the lucrative Super Bowl this year, TV’s premiere advertising event. Shares rose 1.7 percent to $41.99, giving back some of their earlier gains.",5012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/media-results/wrapup-2-major-media-companies-top-estimates-in-shaky-ad-market-idUSnL2N0DI1020130501

The unanimous ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reverses a 2012 decision from the Federal Communications Commission that Comcast unfairly placed the sports channel in a more expensive and thus less-watched viewing tier than its own Golf Channel and NBC Sports Network. Tennis channel on Tuesday said it planned to seek further review of the case. The FCC had voted 3-2 along party lines to require Comcast to put Tennis Channel on par with its own sports network, marking the first time a cable network prevailed over a cable operator under the FCC’s 1993 federal anti-discrimination program carriage rules. Comcast, however, argued that the FCC’s requirement infringed upon its freedom of editorial judgment and speech and that its placement of the Tennis Channel was based on the financial analysis, not discrimination against a rival. Siding with Comcast in his opinion, Judge Stephen Williams said the latter argument was enough because the FCC did not present evidence to establish how Comcast would financially benefit from distributing the Tennis Channel more broadly. “Without showing any benefit for Comcast from incurring the additional fees for assigning Tennis a more advantageous tier, the Commission has not provided evidence that Comcast discriminated against Tennis on the basis of affiliation,” he wrote. Williams had raised those concerns at oral arguments earlier this year, when he said the financial implications of requiring Comcast to move Tennis Channel were unclear. The FCC and the sports network said that Comcast weighed the costs of having Tennis Channel in a higher viewing tier but did not adequately analyze the benefits. Comcast argued that it did, and found none. Tennis Channel said in a statement that Comcast’s “clear pattern of discrimination ... warrants further review of the panel’s decision and we intend to seek that review.” The FCC had no comment on its plans to advance the case. “Tennis Channel received exactly the carriage it bargained for and agreed to. Comcast’s decision to carry Tennis Channel was the product of legitimate business considerations, not affiliation,” Comcast said in welcoming Tuesday’s ruling. The case is Comcast Cable Communications, LLC v. Federal Communications Commission, U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, No. 12-1337.

367,CMCSA,Universal lures 'Dark Knight' producer Tull from Warner Brothers,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - NBCUniversal, cable giant Comcast’s Hollywood unit, has signed Thomas Tull, luring the producer behind big budget blockbusters such as “The Dark Knight” and “Man of Steel” away from Warner Brothers and beating out other studios including Sony and 20th Century Fox. The agreement with NBCUniversal is scheduled to be announced on Wednesday, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction. Financial details are not immediately available. Tull, a former investment banker, started Legendary Entertainment in 2000 with $500 million from private equity investors and in 2005 signed a seven-year deal with Warner Brothers to jointly produce up to 40 films. Legendary, which also produced “The Hangover” series of films, generally provides half the financing for movies whose budgets can run to $200 million or more. Warner Brothers co-financed the films and also collected a fee to distribute them. Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner, made a last minute bid to keep the producer, according to a person with knowledge of the overture. Tull’s company produced two of the industry’s ten top-selling films for Warner Brothers, “The Dark Knight” and “The Dark Knight Rises,” according to the site Box Office Mojo. Its latest movie, the science fiction film “Pacific Rim,” is scheduled to be released by Warner on July 12. Legendary provided 75 percent of the film’s $180 million budget. Representatives for Legendary and NBCUniversal declined comment. Legendary started a comic book unit in 2010 and in June said it hired Bruce Rosenblum, formerly the head of Warner Brothers TV, to head its television and digital media operations. Earlier this year, Legendary also announced an agreement with China Film Co., the largest and most influential film company in China, to co-produce movies.

369,CMCSA,"Media owners keep Hulu website, may bring in partners","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal said on Friday they decided to keep their video streaming website, Hulu, and will invest $750 million to help it grow. Hulu’s owners are still talking to companies that could become partners for the service, a source with knowledge of the discussions said. One is Time Warner Cable Inc, which had offered to make an equity investment in Hulu, two sources told Reuters. The role of future partners has not been determined. Time Warner Cable spokesman Justin Venech had no comment. Disney spokesman Kevin Brockman and Fox spokesman Dan Berger had no comment beyond the companies’ statement. This is the second time the media companies have decided against selling Hulu. They had collected bids from parties including satellite provider DirecTV and former News Corp president Peter Chernin, sources had previously told Reuters. DirecTV had offered more than $1 billion for Hulu, sources said. The first time they weighed selling Hulu was in 2011. Comcast is restricted from making business decisions related to Hulu as part of its settlement with the U.S. government when it acquired NBC Universal. Hulu, launched in 2008, attracts more than 30 million unique monthly visitors, the companies said. The service has more than 4 million subscribers and generates revenue of about $700 million through subscriptions and a free ad-supported service. In a statement on Friday, Chase Carey, Fox’s president and chief operating officer, said Hulu’s owners “had meaningful conversations with a number of potential partners and buyers, each with impressive plans and offers to match.” “But with 21st Century Fox and Disney fully aligned in our collective vision and goals for the business, we decided to continue to empower the Hulu team,” Carey said. After mulling the bids, the owners decided to put more money in to Hulu to expand a business that attracts customers who watch TV shows and movies increasingly through Internet-connected televisions and mobile devices. Hulu competes with services such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Instant Video service. “Hulu has emerged as one of the most consumer friendly, technologically innovative viewing platforms in the digital era,” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement. Disney shares closed 0.6 percent higher at $66.98 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

371,CMCSA,"UPDATE 3-'Arrested' bump disappoints Netflix investors, shares drop","(Rewrites lead; adds comments from Netflix executives, updates share price) By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, July 22 (Reuters) - Quirky comedy “Arrested Development” lured new subscribers to  Netflix Inc’s  streaming service in the second quarter, but not enough to impress investors who sent its shares tumbling 4 percent in after-hours trading on Monday. “Arrested Development,” which Netflix dusted off seven years after it last ran on Fox, generated “a small but noticeable bump in membership,” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Chief Financial  Officer David Wells said in a letter to shareholders. Netflix said it added 630,000 streaming customers in the United States, hitting the middle of a forecast the company issued in April. Wall Street analysts were unimpressed after the market sent the company’s share price up 183 percent this year, the biggest gainer on the S&P; 500 index, in reaction to buzz about shows such as “Arrested Development” and “House of Cards.” On Monday, shares of Netflix fell 4 percent in after-hours trading to $251.50, down from their earlier $261.96 close on the Nasdaq. “It was a good quarter, but not good enough,” said Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia. “The stock had run up too much, too quickly.” Wall Street analysts on average expected Netflix to add 700,000 new customers to the U.S. streaming service, the largest part of its business, Bhatia said. Netflix beat analysts’ forecasts with $29 million in profit, or 49 cents per share, and up from $6 million a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 40 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Reveue for the quarter was $1.07 billion, up 20 percent from $889 million a year earlier. The company shook up Hollywood last week with 14 Emmy nominations for original series including “Arrested Development” and political thriller “House of Cards,” the first Internet series to nab Emmy nods in major categories. The shows are part of a push into original content that Netflix hopes will bring in new subscribers. Hastings said the company was pleased with the response to its original programming. “The strategy is just beginning,” he said in an interview. “The payoff is continued rapid membership growth. If we can continue our rapid membership growth, we’ll feel very pleased.” The original shows are grabbing “TV-sized audiences,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a video webcast with executives, an unusual format that replaced the traditional quarterly conference call. The company declined to provide viewership figures for the shows. Netflix, in its shareholder letter, forecast it will add up to 1.5 million U.S. streaming customers in the current quarter. That guidance “looks like a little light,” Gabelli & Co analyst Brett Harriss said. “Netflix needs to add a substantial amount of subscribers to justify the current valuation.” The company reported 29.8 million U.S. streaming customers at the end of June, and 7.8 million international streaming customers. Netflix is working to add subscribers to pay the cost of movies and TV shows from Hollywood studios, its original shows, and a push into foreign territories. At the same time, it is facing competition from online players such as Amazon.com Inc  and Hulu, which is getting a cash infusion of $750 million from owners Walt Disney Co, 21st Century Fox  and Comcast Corp. “Now that Hulu has more money to spend, content prices may rise further,” Hastings and Wells said in their letter. “But we have many multi-year deals in place to mitigate this.”     (Additionals reporting by Liana B.

374,CMCSA,NBC Universal's fortune reversal lifts Comcast results,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp posted a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, as it added more Internet customers than expected on the cable side and saw a more than 20 percent increase in operating cash flow at its NBC Universal unit. Its shares rose more than 6 percent in morning trading to $45.30 on the better-than-expected results. Analysts said Comcast’s cable business outperformed in what is generally a seasonally weak quarter for the industry, when colleges close for the summer and people disconnect cable service ahead of a move. “The second quarter is always tough for the cable business. But you’d never know it from Comcast’s second-quarter results,” Moffett Research analyst Craig Moffett said. “This consistency speaks to the tight ship Comcast is running these days.” Comcast’s cable unit, which has the most U.S. subscribers of any cable company with 21.7 million, added 187,000 high-speed Internet customers on a net basis. This beat analysts’ expectations of 150,500 additions, which Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount. Comcast, like its smaller rivals, increasingly relies on Internet customers for growth as they continue to lose cable TV subscribers and grapple with rising programming costs. Comcast lost about 159,000 video subscribers in the quarter, which slightly beat estimates of a loss of 159,700 subscribers, according to Street Account. The cable industry faces a challenge from customers who consume an increasing amount of Internet video and subscribe to lower-cost alternatives such as Netflix. Comcast clinched full control of NBC Universal for $16.7 billion earlier this year by buying out General Electric’s stake a few years ahead of schedule. It owns broadcaster NBC, the film studio Universal and a host of cable channels. While the unit is viewed by Wall Street as a perennial money loser in need of a turnaround, it made money for Comcast in the second quarter. Operating cash flow at NBC Universal rose 21 percent to $1.191 billion, driven by the box office performance of the action movie “Fast and Furious 6” and a strong quarter at its cable network units, which oversees channels such as Bravo, E! and the Golf Channel. Chief Executive Brian Roberts said NBC Universal has “real momentum, with solid growth in revenue and double-digit cash flow growth.” NBC also generated $2.1 billion in advance sales for commercial time for the upcoming TV season after wrapping up the so-called “upfront” negotiations. NBC confirmed on Wednesday it secured 7 to 8 percent increases in ad rates above last year. Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said NBC Universal’s performance beat his estimates, partly driven by broadcast network ratings, which benefited from the return of hit singing show “The Voice” in the second quarter. “On the TV side you can really see a benefit in primetime ratings at NBC and a 13 percent increase in advertising revenue, which was more than people had modeled,” he said. In July, Comcast’s movie studio Universal signed Thomas Tull, the founder of film production company Legendary Entertainment that made big-budget blockbusters such as “The Dark Knight” and “Man of Steel”, luring him away from rival Warner Brothers. NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke said on Thursday that the deal “will take a while to get moving.” He said Legendary will make its own films that Universal can co-finance, while Legendary will also co-finance some Universal movies. “On the big film side, the riskiest and in some ways the hardest part of the business right now, we will have a partner in Legendary that has a real passion for that,” Burke said. Comcast posted a second-quarter profit of $1.73 billion, or 65 cents a share, compared with $1.3 billion, or 50 cents a year ago. It beat Wall Street analysts’ estimates by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $16.27 billion. Analysts, on average, expected $16 billion.

Comcast “believes the network’s assets have meaningful value, and would be prepared to make a bid to acquire either the network (under a plan of reorganization) or substantially all of its assets,” the media conglomerate said in court documents. Comcast also said that it wanted the court to appoint a trustee to replace the network’s management, which is at a “complete impasse,” according to court documents. The network’s three-member board consists of representatives of Comcast, the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association and the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball, according to documents filed by a Comcast affiliate. The network has been locked in a dispute with cable and satellite television providers over how much it should receive per subscriber, which has limited the network’s reach. Comcast, which loaned the network $100 million through an affiliate, also said it was prepared to provide the financing necessary to keep the network operating until the bankruptcy could be resolved. The Astros called the filing “improper,” although the team had not been paid its media rights fees by the network for the last three months, according to a Friday press release. Creditors can put a company into bankruptcy involuntarily if they can prove the debtor is not paying its bills. The company generally has about 20 days to respond to the filing. Creditors of Allied Systems Holding Inc, a major hauler of cars for auto dealers that was majority owned by private equity firm Yucaipa Cos, used an involuntary bankruptcy petition to force the company into Chapter 11 last year.

383,CMCSA,REFILE-Director abandons CNN documentary on Hillary Clinton,"(Fixes garbled sentence in 3rd paragraph) By Liana B. Baker and Gabriel Debenedetti Sept 30 (Reuters) - Cable news network CNN has canceled a documentary on Hillary Rodham Clinton after the director said pressure from the Clinton camp as well as Republican leaders made it too difficult to complete the film. A CNN spokeswoman confirmed on Monday that the program would be canceled, saying director “Charles Ferguson has informed us that he is not moving forward with his documentary about Hillary Clinton.” Political observers widely expect Clinton to run for president in 2016 as her early polling numbers make her the Democratic frontrunner. Clinton, the former U.S. Secretary of State, has said she is still considering her options. In a blog post on the Huffington Post website, Ferguson, who had been tapped by CNN to direct to the film last year, said pressure from Clinton’s aides started as soon as he joined the project. He said he had found it difficult to get anyone to cooperate and speak about Clinton. “When I approached people for interviews, I discovered that nobody, and I mean nobody, was interested in helping me make this film. Not Democrats, not Republicans - and certainly nobody who works with the Clintons, (who) wants access to the Clintons, or dreams of a position in a Hillary Clinton administration,” Ferguson said in the blog post. Clinton representatives could not be reached for comment. Ferguson said he was surprised that “prominent Democrats made it known both to CNN and to me” that they weren’t happy with the project. Ferguson also cited pushback from the Republican Party. In August, Republican leaders sent letters of protest to both CNN and NBC, complaining that their planned programs amounted to political ads for Clinton, the wife of former President Bill Clinton. The NBC television network is planning a dramatic miniseries from its entertainment unit, which is separate from its news division. NBC did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday. Republican leaders had resolved to boycott any 2016 presidential debates sponsored by CNN, which is owned by Time Warner Inc, and NBC, owned by Comcast Corp, if the networks went ahead with the projects. Ferguson said he was not pressured by CNN to cancel the project, and that the network’s president, Jeff Zucker, had pledged his support behind the film. “Neither political party wanted the film made. After painful reflection, I decided that I couldn’t make a film of which I would be proud. And so I’m cancelling,” Ferguson said in the blog post.   (Reporting by Liana B.

384,CMCSA,Comcast rolls out remote control accessed through Twitter,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp announced on Wednesday that it developed a new remote control feature in partnership with Twitter that allows users to turn the channel through a tweet. The “See It” button enables viewers to tune in to a live or On Demand show like Sunday Night Football or “The Voice” through their set-top box or mobile device. In addition, the button will let users program digital video recorders or to buy movie tickets through Fandango. “Now with See It, they’ll be able to tune in directly from Twitter,” Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter, said in a statement. Comcast and Twitter said they are in discussions with other distribution partners and TV networks to use the feature to promote their content. The hope is the “See It” button will become as ubiquitous as the Facebook “like.” “There is a lot of promotion and discussion around entertainment on Twitter but the link around that consumption is broken,” Sam Schwartz, Comcast chief business development officer told Reuters. “This is another tool to help people find what they want to watch.” With the See It button, a tweet promoting “The Voice” will let a Comcast Xfinity subscriber directly watch, record or remind a viewer directly through that tweet. Media companies will also have a better sense of how to target Twitter efforts since they will be armed with aggregate data of people watching programs. “We will know how many of those tweets generate consumption back on TV,” Schwartz said. Twitter, which is getting ready to make one of the most highly anticipated public stock debuts since Facebook, is trying to capitalize on its relationship with those who use social media while they watch TV. The 140-character messaging platform is setting its sights on grabbing a piece of the TV advertising market, the first stop for brands that spend billions of dollars a year for TV commercials. One of Twitter’s efforts is a program called Amplify, that allows broadcasters to show video clips and ads through tweets that are coordinated with what is being shown on TV. Comcast, the owner of NBC and the largest cable provider in the United States, said the network is participating in the Amplify program.

Comcast unveiled its X1 cloud-based platform last year and has expanded the service which has an advanced interface, a more complete search function, and a better digital video recorder to nearly all of its markets. John Malone, the billionaire chairman of Liberty Media who made his name in the cable industry, has been calling on Comcast to share its technology with smaller players. Cable companies should team up to create a rival to Internet streaming service Netflix, Malone said on October 10. He thinks Comcast will share its technology with the rest of the industry. Rising programming costs from media companies have combined with online streaming competition from telecom companies such as Verizon and AT&T; are pressuring the cable industry. “The industry needs to be much more coordinated. That’s the theme this year with Malone being in it. It’s all about coordination and consolidation at that point,” said Macquarie analyst Amy Yong. Malone’s Liberty Media has a large stake in cable operator Charter Communications and has been circling Time Warner Cable as a potential acquisition target. Time Warner Cable reports its third-quarter results on Thursday The cable industry also faces another challenge as customers who consume an increasing amount of Internet video, subscribe to lower-cost alternatives such as Netflix. Smit said putting Netflix on its set top boxes was not a priority for Comcast since customers can get that service in several ways. Smit’s remarks were made after Comcast posted quarterly a profit that beat analyst estimates on Wednesday. Shares fell 1.4 percent to $47.05 per share after the company lost more video subscribers than expected and added an amount of high speed Internet customers that missed estimates. Comcast lost about 129,000 video subscribers in the quarter, which was worse than the loss of 102,000 subscribers Wall Street analysts were expecting, according to Street Account. Comcast, like its smaller rivals, increasingly relies on Internet customers for growth as they continue to lose cable TV subscribers to competitors such as and grapple with rising programming costs.

397,CMCSA,Time Warner CEO sees growth for HBO; Q3 profit tops view,"(Reuters) - Time Warner Inc’s third-quarter profit beat estimates, driven by growth at its cable networks, and its chief executive said on Wednesday a new cable package offered by No. 1 cable operator Comcast would help HBO expand its subscriber base. Comcast Corp said in October it would offer a promotion that included HBO, the premium cable channel, and its HBO Go online service in a pared-down basic cable package of about 10 channels as well as Internet access for about $50 a month. The move was closely watched by investors and analysts, who see it as a test for HBO to be sold in a different format, and as a sign that one day customers will be able to buy smaller packages of channels. Speaking on a conference call with analysts, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said the package “could be an effective way” for HBO to reach the 8 million or 10 million homes that currently have Internet subscriptions, but no video service. HBO is still figuring out how to get a bigger slice of the 60 million to 70 million U.S. customers who pay for a television subscriptions but don’t have HBO. Finance chief John Martin said the company is seeing “some encouraging subscriber trends at HBO” that will drive subscriber revenue to accelerate next year. Bewkes insisted that if the small cable bundles become popular, Time Warner Cable’s basic channels such as TNT and TBS would still be included in the packages. “If there’s viability and consumer attractiveness for people trying to get basically a more focused, more valuable and less expensive basic cable package, our channels will be in there,” Bewkes said. Bewkes updated the timing for the spinoff of Time Inc, saying that Time Warner Inc’s publishing assets will become an independent company in the second quarter of 2014. The company announced the spinoff earlier this year. On October 31, longtime news executive Norman Pearlstine said he was leaving Bloomberg LP to return to Time Inc in the newly created job of executive vice president and chief content officer, reporting to CEO Joe Ripp. Revenue at the publishing unit fell 2 percent to $818 million in the third quarter, the company said. Revenue at its cable business, including Turner Broadcasting channels such as CNN as well as HBO, increased 5 percent to $3.5 billion. Advertising was up 11 percent to $96 million. “A strong advertising demand environment has helped,” said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger. “But the main story for the stock has been, and continues to be, anticipated acceleration of subscription fees.” Time Warner has forecast significant percentage gains in subscription fees when it renews contracts with pay TV operators through 2014 and 2015. Revenues fell 7 percent to $2.7 billion at its Film and TV Entertainment unit that includes Warner Brothers. It blamed the decline partly on a tough comparison to a year ago, when it benefited from the strong box office from the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises.” Net income for Time Warner was $1.18 billion, or $1.26 cents per share, up from $822 million, or 84 cents a share, a year ago. Adjusting for discontinued operations and other items, earnings per share were $1.01, which beat Wall Street estimates by 12 cents. Revenue rose 0.2 percent to $6.86 billion.

398,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-Time Warner CEO sees growth for HBO; Q3 profit tops view,"(Adds CEO remarks from conference call, analyst quote, Comcast details) By Liana B. Baker Nov 6 (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc’s third-quarter profit beat estimates, driven by growth at its cable networks, and its chief executive said on Wednesday a new cable package offered by No. 1 cable operator Comcast would help HBO expand its subscriber base. Comcast Corp said in October it would offer a promotion that included HBO, the premium cable channel, and its HBO Go online service in a pared-down basic cable package of about 10 channels as well as Internet access for about $50 a month. The move was closely watched by investors and analysts, who see it as a test for HBO to be sold in a different format, and as a sign that one day customers will be able to buy smaller packages of channels. Speaking on a conference call with analysts, Time Warner  CEO Jeff Bewkes said the package “could be an effective way” for HBO to reach the 8 million or 10 million homes that currently have Internet subscriptions, but no video service. HBO is still figuring out how to get a bigger slice of the 60 million to 70 million U.S. customers who pay for a television subscriptions but don’t have HBO. Finance chief John Martin said the company is seeing “some encouraging subscriber trends at HBO” that will drive subscriber revenue to accelerate next year. Bewkes insisted that if the small cable bundles become popular, Time Warner Cable’s basic channels such as TNT and TBS would still be included in the packages. “If there’s viability and consumer attractiveness for people trying to get basically a more focused, more valuable and less expensive basic cable package, our channels will be in there,” Bewkes said. Bewkes updated the timing for the spinoff of Time Inc, saying that Time Warner Inc’s publishing assets will become an independent company in the second quarter of 2014. The company announced the spinoff earlier this year. On Oct. 31, longtime news executive Norman Pearlstine said he was leaving Bloomberg LP to return to Time Inc in the newly created job of executive vice president and chief content officer, reporting to CEO Joe Ripp. Revenue at the publishing unit fell 2 percent to $818 million in the third quarter, the company said. Revenue at its cable business, including Turner Broadcasting channels such as CNN as well as HBO, increased 5 percent to $3.5 billion. Advertising was up 11 percent to $96 million. “A strong advertising demand environment has helped,” said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger. “But the main story for the stock has been, and continues to be, anticipated acceleration of subscription fees.” Time Warner has forecast significant percentage gains in subscription fees when it renews contracts with pay TV operators through 2014 and 2015. Revenues fell 7 percent to $2.7 billion at its Film and TV Entertainment unit that includes Warner Brothers. It blamed the decline partly on a tough comparison to a year ago, when it benefited from the strong box office from the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises.” Net income for Time Warner was $1.18 billion, or $1.26 cents per share, up from $822 million, or 84 cents a share, a year ago. Adjusting for discontinued operations and other items, earnings per share were $1.01, which beat Wall Street estimates by 12 cents. Revenue rose 0.2 percent to $6.86 billion. Analysts expected $6.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Time Warner shares fell 17 cents, or 0.2 percent to $68.06.   (Reporting by Liana B.

399,CMCSA,UPDATE 4-Dish says closer to deal to keep Disney networks on board,"(Adds comments from conference call, new analyst comments) By Liana B. Baker and Sinead Carew Nov 12 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp is closer to reaching a large-scale programming deal with Disney that would help the satellite TV provider avoid a possible blackout of popular networks such as ABC and ESPN, Chairman Charlie Ergen said on Tuesday. He added that he is keeping the company’s options open with regards to possible alliances for use of billions of dollars worth of wireless spectrum the company has amassed. Shares rose more than 5 percent after the No. 2 U.S. satellite TV company reported better-than-expected subscriber numbers and revenue in the third quarter. Disney and Dish’s programming agreement expired at the end of September, but they have been in discussions and have so far averted a blackout of Disney’s top networks such as ABC and ESPN for the satellite provider’s 14 million customers. Ergen said that Disney is seeking a long-term contract lasting several years and “both sides are trying to look at where the technology is going...and what the world might look like in several years,” echoing comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger last week. Dish may be trying to get more flexibility out of Disney in a new contract that would include better digital rights and the ability to put channels on different tiers, said ISI analyst Vijay Jayant. Ergen also said it was too soon to finalize Dish’s strategy regarding the wireless spectrum the company has spent billions amassing. He analysts he would likely know more early next year after upcoming auctions of spectrum controlled by the government and bankrupt communications firm LightSquared. Ergen noted that anti-collusion rules will force a pause in any negotiations between applicants in the government auction starting from Nov. 15. The executive, who founded Dish 33 years ago, said he would look for ways to use wireless spectrum to enhance its video offerings rather than on areas such as voice, data and texting services which traditional wireless operators already “do pretty well.” “We have to make our video ubiquitous so that’s our focus,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that we would do other things but ideally it would be video-centric.” Otherwise Ergen said that he is keeping all options open, from the possibility for a purchase of No. 4 U.S. mobile operator T-Mobile US, to forging a partnership, building a wireless network or even selling Dish’s spectrum. Ergen also said that the news today that US Airways and AMR had reached a government antitrust settlement on their merger could bode well for a deal one day with DirecTV because it means the government is willing to “negotiate things.”  The two satellite companies attempted a merger that was blocked by regulators in 2001. “There’s obviously a business case that makes a lot of sense for consolidation in the satellite industry,” Ergen said. Dish added a surprise 35,000 video customers in the quarter.  Wall Street analysts, on average, had looked for Dish to lose 39,000 subscribers, according to market research firm StreetAccount. Revenue also topped analysts’ estimates. The gains underlined how satellite services are gaining customers by undercutting cable rivals on price. DirecTV  also added more customers than expected in the quarter, while cable providers Time Warner Cable Inc, Comcast Corp  and Charter Communications Inc all lost video subscribers. Dish also got a bit of a boost from Time Warner Cable’s protracted fight with CBS Corp. “Dish’s Q3 operating results were surprisingly good, as were DirecTV’s, boosted perhaps by the travails at Time Warner Cable, which got smoked in its programming dispute with CBS,” said Craig Moffett, a research analyst at MoffettNathanson. Revenue generated per subscriber rose to $81.05 from $76.99. Dish reported net income of $315 million, or 68 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a net loss of $158 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2 percent to $3.60 billion, compared with expectations of $3.58 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

407,CMCSA,Comcast tests new ad tech to help networks capture binge viewers,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable operator, is testing new advertising technology that inserts up-to-date commercials into past episodes of TV shows that are available on demand, a development that could help television networks generate additional revenue. As people get used to catching up on or binging on older episodes of shows through online services like Netflix and Hulu, cable companies and TV networks are plying viewers with past episodes from current seasons that can be watched on demand through their cable set-top boxes. The new technology is meant to give TV networks a way to earn ad dollars from earlier episodes. Currently, most advertisers only pay for ads watched live or within three days after a show airs. That could change if Comcast’s technology, which it developed in partnership with Nielsen, is widely adopted. With the new service it is testing, Comcast will take the same commercials that aired live and insert them into a show’s older episodes that are watched on demand. TV networks can try to broker deals with advertisers to pay for the additional viewership, which will be measured by Nielsen. For now, the technology only applies to shows on broadcast TV networks. Comcast subscribers cannot fast-forward ads when they watch on-demand shows from the broadcast networks. Comcast is testing the new ad service with shows on NBC, the broadcast network it owns, as well as Walt Disney Co’s ABC network, said Matt Strauss, Comcast’s senior vice president of video services. CBS is also interested, Strauss said. The company aims to make the service available for the ad market next year. “This becomes a new way for programmers to monetize not just the most recent episode, but every episode, which has pretty big implications,” Strauss said. The video on-demand market for ads totals about $1 billion year, according to research firm Rentrak and can grow with these new developments. It is unclear if advertisers are on-board with paying networks for the new on-demand credits and it’s up to the networks to pitch them, Strauss said. Comcast is the biggest cable provider with more than 22 million video subscribers, providing a large potential audience to test the idea with advertisers.

411,CMCSA,Exclusive: Comcast taps JPMorgan on potential Time Warner Cable bid - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top U.S. cable provider Comcast Corp has tapped JPMorgan Chase & Co for advice as it evaluates a potential bid for Time Warner Cable Inc, people familiar with the matter said. Comcast brought in the bank to help review options as speculation about cable industry consolidation increased in the past several months, one of the people said. Comcast does not plan to make a pre-emptive bid for No. 2 cable provider Time Warner Cable, the subject of a months-long pursuit by much smaller rival Charter Communications Inc, but could jump in if signs emerge that Charter is getting close to a deal, the people said. Comcast, which has a market value of more than $127 billion, might also decide against doing any deal, they added. The people asked not to be identified by name because the matter is not public. Representatives for Comcast and JPMorgan declined to comment. Time Warner Cable, which has said it was open to a deal at the right price, considers Comcast to be the best merger partner because the larger rival can afford to make an all-cash offer and provides a better geographic fit, separate people familiar with the matter have said. Charter has a market value of about $13 billion, much less than Time Warner Cable’s $37 billion, and would need to raise a large amount of debt to finance a deal. A Comcast takeover bid would likely face close scrutiny from antitrust regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission because it would create a dominant company controlling more than one third of the pay TV market. Comcast currently has 23 million video subscribers while Time Warner Cable has about 12 million. In comparison, third-ranked Cox Communications has 4.5 million and No.4 player Charter has 4.2 million. Newly installed FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has also spoken out in favor of competition. A former chief at both the cable industry and wireless industry trade groups, Wheeler spent his first days in office taking a hard line against wireless providers and continuously speaking about promoting competition. But a large cable merger is still possible because cable operators generally do not offer services in the same markets and instead compete with satellite and telcom TV services, industry experts have said. Charter, in which cable billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp owns a 27 percent stake, has its own challenges. The company offered to buy Time Warner Cable earlier this spring, but was rebuffed because it did not offer a premium, Reuters previously reported. And any deal has gotten much more expensive since, with takeover speculation pushing Time Warner Cable’ shares above $130 from the mid $90s in May — when Charter first approached the company. Charter’s pursuit of Time Warner Cable also attracted the interest of privately held Cox Communications, which is examining its own options for a deal with the second-largest U.S. cable operator, people familiar with the matter said. Any suitor would likely need to bid at least $150 per share to be considered seriously by Time Warner Cable’s board, one person familiar with the matter said. A tie-up with Charter raises particular concerns for Time Warner Cable because any offer from the smaller rival would have a large stock component and heavily indebt the combined company, people familiar with the matter have said. Charter’s stock price has increased about 70 percent this year, which could be viewed as an inflated currency by Time Warner Cable shareholders. Depending on the amount of debt it raises, a Charter-Time Warner Cable combination could push up the merged company’s leverage ratio to five or six times. Time Warner Cable’s current leverage is just over three times while Charter’s leverage ratio is 4.9 times. Steve Soranno, an equity analyst at Calvert Investment Management, which has $13 billion under management and owns Time Warner Cable shares, said he is not convinced if he wants to hold shares in a merged Charter-Time Warner Cable. One of the reasons the firm likes Time Warner Cable is because the company has been reducing its debt level and has a stable cash flow structure, he said. “In order to accept a deal with Charter, shareholders have to accept a fundamentally different capital structure with a heck of a lot more debt. How solid is its growth profile? How solid is the stock you’re getting?” Soranno said.

412,CMCSA,NBC climbs ratings mountain with live 'Sound of Music' special,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. network NBC’s live telecast of the musical “The Sound of Music” played to the tune of 18.5 million viewers, the Comcast Corp-owned broadcaster said on Friday, helping NBC inject some momentum into its entertainment division. The three-hour production on Thursday starring country singer Carrie Underwood as Maria, the would-be nun who falls in love with an anti-Nazi Austrian captain, was NBC’s best non-sports draw in the 18 to 49 age group most coveted by advertisers since the finale of hospital drama “ER” in 2009. “The Sound of Music” telecast, which was based on the 1959 stage version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein show rather than the Oscar-winning 1965 film starring Julie Andrews, was the top overall draw on U.S. prime-time TV on Thursday, according to Nielsen figures. NBC has languished at the bottom or near it in overall viewers in recent years, dragged down by poorly rated entertainment offerings compared with rivals CBS, Fox and ABC. But for the TV season that started in September, NBC ranks second among overall viewers and first among 18-to-49-year olds, according to Nielsen data through December 1. Its ratings hits include “Sunday Night Football” and singing competition “The Voice.” Although critics commended NBC for taking a risk on an expensive production, which reportedly cost $9 million and required several sets and lavish costumes, they sounded a sour tone on the performances, particularly Underwood. “As her multiple Grammys and her legion of country music fans will attest, the quality of Underwood’s singing voice is not the problem,” USA Today’s Robert Bianco wrote. “It’s that she doesn’t know how to use that voice to sing in character, or what to do with her face when she’s trying.” The 30-year-old singer, who has become one of biggest country stars since winning the singing contest “American Idol” in 2005, has little experience acting compared to her co-star, “True Blood” actor Stephen Moyer as Captain von Trapp. Veteran Broadway stars Audra McDonald (Mother Abbess), Laura Benanti (Elsa Schrader) and Christian Borle (Max Detweiler) rounded out the cast of the musical famous for hit songs “My Favorite Things” and “Edelweiss.” “Underwood nails the look of a virginal almost-nun, but goes no deeper than that.

413,CMCSA,NBC climbs ratings mountain with live 'Sound of Music' special,"LOS ANGELES, Dec 6 (Reuters) - U.S. network NBC’s live telecast of the musical “The Sound of Music” played to the tune of 18.5 million viewers, the Comcast Corp-owned  broadcaster said on Friday, helping NBC inject some momentum into its entertainment division. The three-hour production on Thursday starring country singer Carrie Underwood as Maria, the would-be nun who falls in love with an anti-Nazi Austrian captain, was NBC’s best non-sports draw in the 18 to 49 age group most coveted by advertisers since the finale of hospital drama “ER” in 2009. “The Sound of Music” telecast, which was based on the 1959 stage version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein show rather than the Oscar-winning 1965 film starring Julie Andrews, was the top overall draw on U.S. prime-time TV on Thursday, according to Nielsen figures. NBC has languished at the bottom or near it in overall viewers in recent years, dragged down by poorly rated entertainment offerings compared with rivals CBS, Fox and ABC. But for the TV season that started in September, NBC ranks second among overall viewers and first among 18-to-49-year olds, according to Nielsen data through Dec. 1. Its ratings hits include “Sunday Night Football” and singing competition “The Voice.” Although critics commended NBC for taking a risk on an expensive production, which reportedly cost $9 million and required several sets and lavish costumes, they sounded a sour tone on the performances, particularly Underwood. “As her multiple Grammys and her legion of country music fans will attest, the quality of Underwood’s singing voice is not the problem,” USA Today’s Robert Bianco wrote. “It’s that she doesn’t know how to use that voice to sing in character, or what to do with her face when she’s trying.” The 30-year-old singer, who has become one of biggest country stars since winning the singing contest “American Idol” in 2005, has little experience acting compared to her co-star, “True Blood” actor Stephen Moyer as Captain von Trapp. Veteran Broadway stars Audra McDonald (Mother Abbess), Laura Benanti (Elsa Schrader) and Christian Borle (Max Detweiler) rounded out the cast of the musical famous for hit songs “My Favorite Things” and “Edelweiss.” “Underwood nails the look of a virginal almost-nun, but goes no deeper than that. Blank stares and placid smiles,” wrote Marc Bernardin of trade magazine the Hollywood Reporter. Critics’ opinions also echoed the live reaction on Twitter from viewers, who were mixed on Underwood’s performance. NBC’s “The Sound of Music” harked back to the early days of U.S. television when live musicals were often shown.

415,CMCSA,"UPDATE 1-Time Warner Cable, Charter execs see benefits of deals but in no rush","By Liana B. Baker Dec 9 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable’s incoming chief executive Rob Marcus said on Monday he is in no hurry to sell the company, while Charter’s CEO Tom Rutledge, a potential suitor, said the  smaller company sees benefits in growing through acquisitions. Speaking at an investment conference hosted by the bank UBS, Marcus said his job as CEO will be to do what is best for shareholders. He said he would be open to selling the company only if a deal benefits investors. “Whether or not Time Warner Cable will participate in M&A; is and always has been, whether as a buyer or seller, 100 percent driven by what’s in the best interest of our shareholders,” Rutledge said. Time Warner Cable is the subject of takeover speculation and is being circled by suitors such as Charter Communications Inc , Comcast Corp and privately held Cox. Charter’s CEO Tom Rutledge said later at the UBS conference that Charter does not have to do an acquisition to grow, but there are major opportunities Charter can pursue once it reaches a larger scale. Charter has been speculated to become an industry consolidator since cable billionaire John Malone took a 27 percent stake in the company in the spring. If Charter was able to become larger through an acquisition, Charter would save on programming costs, could create a national advertising product, and expand its telecom services, Rutledge said. It might also develop Internet video streaming products, known as “over-the-top” services, he added. Rutledge did not comment directly on merger speculation regarding Time Warner Cable but did acknowledge that low interest rates create the best situation he’s “ever seen” to borrow large sums of money. Charter has a market value of about $13 billion, much less than Time Warner Cable’s $37 billion, and would need to raise a large amount of debt to finance a deal. Rutledge said his favorite acquisition targets are the ones that he can turn around, such the cable company Bresnan, which his company bought for $1.62 billion from Cablevision earlier this year. “The bigger opportunity in most M&A; that I’m interested in is the opportunity to operate and to unleash the full power of these networks, by unburdening them of analog signals, and standing up products that work the marketplace and growing the business,” Rutledge said. Charter is converting its analog video signals to digital which frees up bandwidth to provide other services such as broadband Internet. Time Warner Cable’s networks are not all digital yet, while Comcast has made the full transition to digital. While Time Warner Cable’s Marcus refrained from discussing the takeover speculation at length at the conference, he did say in a question-and-answer session there would be general benefits to consolidation in cable, such as eliminating overhead and reducing programming and infrastructure costs. Marcus said he is “committed to fixing” the company’s residential business, which has suffered major declines over the past few years, while also expanding the business services unit. He forecast business services would grow to $5 billion in revenue over the next four to five years. He said the recent hiring of Dinni Jain as chief operating officer was an example of an improvement to Time Warner Cable’s management team.

418,CMCSA,Exclusive: Comcast weighs three options for Time Warner Cable deal: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp is examining three scenarios for a potential deal with Time Warner Cable, including a full takeover bid for the second-largest cable operator, people close to the situation said on Monday. Top cable provider Comcast is also considering whether it could buy some selective Time Warner Cable markets, or team up with another cable company besides Charter Communications Inc to bid for all of Time Warner Cable, the people said. Besides Comcast and Charter, privately held Cox Communications Inc also has interest in a potential deal involving Time Warner Cable, people familiar with the matter have previously said. Comcast, which has a market capitalization of roughly $127 billion, could ultimately decide not to do any deal, said the people, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with media organizations. A full takeover of Time Warner Cable makes sense because the company has geographic markets complementary to Comcast, while taking on a partner would give them opportunity to pick and choose key markets, one of the people said. Analysts say buying all of Time Warner Cable would also face tough regulatory scrutiny. Comcast is weighing all three options equally at this point and would wait to see what kind of offer Charter come up with before pursuing any one of the options, the person added. Comcast is being advised by JPMorgan Chase & Co on a potential deal for Time Warner Cable, Reuters previously reported. Representatives for Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Cox declined to comment. Charter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The potential entry of Comcast into a still-developing bidding war could complicate months-long efforts by Charter and its largest shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, to acquire Time Warner Cable. Charter, the No. 4 cable player in which John Malone’s Liberty Media owns a 27 percent stake, is preparing to send an offer letter for Time Warner Cable as soon as this week, valuing the larger rival at below $135 per share, Reuters reported on Friday. But it remains unclear whether the expected cash and stock bid from Charter, which would provide little premium to Time Warner Cable’s current trading prices, would gain traction with the larger rival’s shareholders or its management. Charter has a market value of $13 billion, which is much smaller than Time Warner Cable’s $37 billion market value. Shares of Time Warner Cable ended 0.6 percent higher at $132.09 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Any bid would need to be at least $150 per share to be considered seriously by the company’s board, a person familiar with the company’s thinking previously said. Liberty Media’s Chairman John Malone and its CEO Greg Maffei met with some of Time Warner Cable’s largest shareholders in Denver last week and pitched the merits of a combination with Charter, other people familiar with the matter said. Attendees at the meeting included representatives from the hedge fund Paulson, as well as institutional investors such as Dodge & Cox, Capital Research and Wellington. A spokesman for Dodge & Cox declined to comment while representatives from the other shareholders as well as Liberty Media did not respond to requests for comment on the meeting. Some of the shareholders, however, told the executives that they would not entertain a deal without a substantial premium, some of the people said. One of the Time Warner Cable shareholders in attendance, for example, said they would not be interested in doing a deal for less than 8 times Time Warner Cable’s 2013 earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITDA), the people said. A deal at that multiple would imply a bid price above $140. Time Warner Cable is currently trading at 7.6 times its 2013 EBIDTA, while Charter is trading at 9.5 times, according to Brean Murray analyst Todd Mitchell. Charter’s multiple is viewed as inflated because it trades more richly than the less than 7 times multiple of Comcast’s cable unit, which is the most well-regarded cable operator by investors, Mitchell said.

Although many in the market expect the Fed to begin to wind down its market-friendly $85 billion a month in asset purchases in March, some are betting on an earlier tapering of stimulus after a recent string of better-than-expected economic data. U.S. consumer prices were flat in November, but a bounce back in the annual inflation rate from a four-year low will probably give the Fed cover to start the taper. Separate data showed the U.S. current account deficit was the smallest in four years in the third quarter as exports increased and more income was earned abroad. The Fed has said its current policy is data-dependant, and some market participants believe the U.S. central bank will upgrade its estimates for economic activity after a two-day meeting that is set to begin later on Tuesday. “The Fed meeting begins today so I don’t expect the market to do much after yesterday’s strong performance,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “The news remains consistent with an economy that continues to gain traction and the market has discounted a Fed move.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.28 points or 0.05 percent, to 15,892.85, the S&P; 500 lost 3.49 points or 0.2 percent, to 1,783.05 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 6.391 points or 0.16 percent, to 4,023.126. KKR & Co said Monday it would acquire its specialty finance company KKR Financial Holdings in a $2.6 billion deal, paid for with KKR shares trading at an all-time high. KFN shares rose 27.5 percent to $12.05 while KKR slipped 2.9 percent to $24.36. Facebook shares rose 1.8 percent to $54.81 after the Wall Street Journal reported the social network will begin selling video ads later this week. Shares of 3M rose 2.6 percent to $131.02 after the industrial conglomerate affirmed its outlook and raised its dividend. AT&T; said it would sell its wireline operations in Connecticut to Frontier Communications for $2 billion in cash, partly to fund the expansion of its 4G network. Frontier shares jumped 8.5 percent to $4.77. Boeing’s board raised the company dividend about 50 percent on Monday and approved $10 billion in new share buyback authority that the company said it would use in the next two to three years.

426,CMCSA,'Fast and Furious 7' to be released in April 2015 -Vin Diesel,"NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - “Fast and Furious 7,” the action film that was shut down after the sudden death in a car crash last month of actor Paul Walker will be released in April 2015, the star of the series, Vin Diesel, said on Sunday. Diesel posted a message on his Facebook page saying “Fast and Furious 7 will be released ... April 10th 2015!,” adding “P.s. He’d want you to know first ...,” in an apparent reference to Walker, who was killed on Nov. 30 in a fiery car wreck in Santa Clarita in Southern California. The film, the seventh in a series of hit films about car racing, was originally slated for release on July 11 next year, according to Universal Pictures, which is owned by Comcast Corp. Walker became a symbol of street-racing and car culture in his role as law enforcement officer Brian O’Conner in the “Fast & Furious” series. Days after the accident, which killed the car’s driver as well as Walker, 40, Universal suspended production of the new movie. The Diesel-led “Fast & Furious” movies, which have grossed more than $2 billion at the global box office, are one of two major franchises, along with the animated “Despicable Me” films, that helped turn around Universal Pictures in recent years.

427,CMCSA,Exclusive: Universal takes writedown on new Keanu Reeves film,"Los Angeles (Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures movie studio has taken unspecified write-downs for its $175 million, Keanu Reeves film “47 Ronin” that opens on Christmas Day, the studio has acknowledged, as Hollywood neared the end of a year of big budget bombs. The film, a fantasy action film about a group of samurai in 18th century Japan, cost $175 million to make, according to people with knowledge of its budget. It is expected to gross between $17 million and $20 million for the five-day Christmas Day holiday period through Sunday December 29, Hollywood experts have forecast, a particularly weak showing for a big budget film. “Universal Pictures regularly evaluates its film slate for potential adjustment,” said a Universal official. “In the case of ‘47 Ronin,’ we adjusted film costs in previous quarters and as a result, our financial performance will not be negatively impacted this quarter by its theatrical performance.” Universal did not disclose the size of the earlier write-downs. Although Hollywood executives cautiously predict a record year at the box office, many had their own big budget misfires. Walt Disney wrote down the costs of the $215 million Johnny Depp western “The Lone Ranger,” which it had said lost more than $160 million. Earlier in the year, Dreamworks Animation took an $87 million write down for its 2012 holiday film “Rise of the Guardians,” while Warner Brothers’ “Jack the Giant Slayer” generated $197.7 million in worldwide ticket sales and cost $195 million to make. (Studios generally get half the ticket sales.) Sony cited the “theatrical underperformance” of the $150 million thriller “White House Down” as one reason its studio recorded a $181 million loss in its second quarter. Universal’s “47 Ronin” tells the story of a half-Japanese former slave, played by Keanu Reeves, who joins a band of outcast samurai intent on avenging the death of their master and who battle mythic beasts and shape-shifting witches. It was initially scheduled for release in November 2012, but was moved to February 2013 for more work on the 3D visual efforts, before it was postponed to Christmas Day. The film has grossed an estimated $6.2 million in three foreign markets, including Japan and Singapore, Universal said. Powered by hits “Despicable Me 2” and “Fast & Furious 6,” the studio had a record year at the box office in 2013, it said earlier in the year, crossing $2 billion mark in international ticket sales for the first time in its 101-year history. It also had its best year in the domestic market, with $1.4 billion in North American film sales, third behind Warner Brothers and Walt Disney, according to Box Office Mojo. On December 23, Universal said it had pushed back its car chase movie “Fast & Furious 7” by nine months to April 2015 after co-star Paul Walker died in a car crash.

431,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-Time Warner Cable staunched subscriber bleed in Q4,"By Liana B. Baker LAS VEGAS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc  shed 215,000 video subscribers in the fourth quarter but added about 40,000 high-speed Internet home customers, its chief financial officer said on Wednesday. That marked an improvement from the third quarter for a cable company that’s the subject of takeover speculation. It lost 304,000 video customers, almost double the number Wall Street investors had expected, and 24,000 Internet users during that period. Chief Financial Officer Arthur Minson said the company has seen favorable trends so far in January, after having added 60,000 subscribers in December - 40,000 more than it managed in the same month a year earlier. “Seven of the last eight weeks have been a little bit better than last year so we have our mojo back on the subscriber side, and we’re very optimistic as we head into the year,” Minson told an investor conference held on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Liberty Media Corp, which has a large stake in cable operator Charter Communications Inc, has made no secret of its pursuit of No.2 cable provider Time Warner Cable, which is being circled by other suitors such as Comcast Corp  and privately held Cox, industry sources have said. Liberty Chairman John Malone argues new managers such as Charter Chief Executive Tom Rutledge could do a better job running the company, which has suffered some of the industry’s worst subscriber losses in past years. Malone, whose Liberty Media owns 27 percent of Charter Communications, the country’s fourth largest cable operator, is expected to make a bid to buy Time Warner Cable in coming weeks. Comcast, the nation’s largest, is mulling a bid as well. If a company comes along with an offer that is better than the value the company can create on its own, “that’s something we need to take a hard look at,” Minson said on Wednesday. But he added any deal would have a “high bar.”",1082014,http://www.reuters.com/article/ces-timewarnercable/update-1-time-warner-cable-staunched-subscriber-bleed-in-q4-idUSL2N0KI1H820140108
432,CMCSA,Video service Hulu adds new shows to original series slate,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Video streaming website Hulu is expanding its slate of original programming in 2014 and will introduce four new series including reality TV satire “The Hotwives of Orlando” and supernatural comedy “Deadbeat.” Hulu on Wednesday announced it also will release new episodes this year of six other exclusive series, including comedian Seth Meyers’ animated superhero show “The Awesomes,” and “Moone Boy,” starring “Bridesmaids” actor Chris O’Dowd. The video streaming site, which offers next-day repeats of shows on broadcast TV networks ABC, Fox and NBC, is expanding its original programming to lure new viewers. The company competes with services like Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Instant Video. Hulu offers free movies and TV shows for viewing on a computer through advertising-supported Hulu.com. It charges $8 a month for additional shows through Hulu Plus, which can be streamed on Internet-connected TVs and mobile devices. The service is owned by Walt Disney Co, 21st Century Fox and Comcast Corp. Last year the media giants considered selling the website but decided to keep it and invest $750 million. A “significant portion” of that investment “will go toward bringing exclusive first-run content onto the service,” Charlotte Koh, head of development for Hulu Originals, said in an interview. “We are definitely increasing the number of shows we are producing in-house and acquiring,” she said. “The breadth and variety of it is becoming a little wider.” Last year, Hulu released about 20 exclusive shows, including original productions and imports of foreign series. This year’s “The Hotwives of Orlando” is a spoof of Bravo’s “Real Housewives” reality TV series and is produced by Paramount Digital Entertainment, the studio behind “Burning Love,” a satire of “The Bachelor” dating competition. “Deadbeat,” a co-production with Lionsgate Television, is a comedy about a medium who helps ghosts settle unfinished business. Stars include Tyler Labine of former CW show “Reaper” and “So You Think You Can Dance” host Cat Deeley. Hulu’s other new shows are “The Next Step,” about a group of teen dancers, and “The Bridge,” a Scandinavian crime drama. Hulu’s revenue was expected to reach $1 billion in 2013, according to a December 18 blog post from CEO Mike Hopkins. The service launched in 2008. The company will announce more shows for 2014 later this year, Koh said.

436,CMCSA,Golden Globe Awards draws best TV audience in 10 years,"LOS ANGELES, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Sunday’s telecast of the 71st annual Golden Globe Awards drew its best audience in the past decade as 20.9 million people tuned in to watch the Hollywood awards show, Comcast Corp-owned network NBC said on Monday. The three-hour awards show, which honors the year’s achievements in film and television, rose 6 percent in total viewers compared to last year and was up 2 percent in the 18-49 age group most coveted by advertisers, according to early figures from Nielsen Media Research. The show hosted for a second consecutive year by comedians Tina Fey and Amy Poehler paid dividends again for NBC as the Golden Globe Awards beat other televised ceremonies such as the Emmys and People’s Choice Awards for viewers. Fey and Poehler, who poked fun at their peers and themselves, have earned critical praise for their performances over the past two years, compared to the mixed reviews for predecessor, acidic British comic Ricky Gervais. The duo have already signed on to host next year’s Golden Globes. Big film winners at the Golden Globes, which are handed out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, were historical slavery drama “12 Years a Slave” and 1970s corruption romp “American Hustle.”",1132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/television-goldenglobes-ratings/golden-globe-awards-draws-best-tv-audience-in-10-years-idUSL2N0KN1RK20140113

438,CMCSA,Charter takes rejected Time Warner Cable bid to investors,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc on Monday formally offered to acquire larger rival Time Warner Cable for $37.3 billion, sparking what is likely to be a contentious battle for control of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator. Charter, the No. 4 cable operator, proposed paying $132.50 per share - barely higher than where Time Warner Cable shares closed on Monday - consisting of around $83 per share in cash and its own stock. Monday’s offer is the boldest sign yet that cable billionaire and dealmaker John Malone thinks that new managers could do a better job running the company, which has fallen behind by not investing enough in taking on competitors and shifting to digital technology. Malone’s Liberty Media Corp owns 27 percent of Charter. Including debt, the deal is worth $62.35 billion. Time Warner Cable shareholders would get 45 percent ownership in the combined company. The letter was Charter’s third attempt to buy the company, according to its executives, and within a few hours of receiving it, Time Warner Cable’s board rejected the offer as “grossly inadequate.” “In essence, these guys are just trying to get a premium asset at a bargain basement price,” said Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Officer Rob Marcus in an interview. “This makes the job of fending it off rather straightforward. Our shareholders will see it as what it is, an attempt to steal the company.” Marcus, who took over the top post on January 1 after eight years, said the board told Charter it was open to a price of $160 per share, consisting of $100 in cash and $60 per share of Charter’s stock. Charter now plans to take the deal directly to Time Warner Cable shareholders, said Charter’s CEO Tom Rutledge in an interview. “(Time Warner Cable) came back to us with a design to be dismissive. They have not engaged with us. All of the conversations have been one way,” Rutledge said. Rutledge, who spent 23 years at Time Warner Cable earlier in his career, told Reuters he could run the company better and pointed to how Time Warner Cable shed more than 500,000 video subscribers in the past two quarters. Rutledge said Time Warner Cable shareholders should be happy with the $83 per share cash component of the deal, since it is not that far off the stock price before the takeover speculation began six months ago. “The purpose of going to the public is to talk to Time Warner shareholders and to ask them to consider how valuable this deal is and to ask management and the board to engage,” he said. He added that a proxy contest in which Time Warner Cable shareholders could vote in new directors friendly to a Charter bid was a possibility. The season for naming such rival board slates starts this week. Time Warner Cable’s Chief Financial Officer Arthur Minson said he doubted Charter could launch a viable proxy fight. “Essentially what you’d have to do is try to get new board members who would have to breach their fiduciary duty by trying to sell the company to Charter cheaply,” Minson said. Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said she expects Charter to raise its bid. “This is just the opening round of the negotiations,” Yong said. “This was Charter sending notice that they won’t overpay.” Charter CEO Rutledge wouldn’t comment on whether the company would consider a higher offer, and said the company would be disciplined about raising the bid. The letter was necessary, he said, because talks with the board had not progressed in the past six months. A hostile move is unusual, he admitted, in the clubby cable industry, where companies do not directly compete with each other. Rutledge said Charter had financing was in place and banks could sign commitment letters “in a matter of days.” Charter stock was up 1.3 percent in after-hours trading while Time Warner Cable shares were up 1.8 percent at $135. ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said that “we think an ultimate consolidation of the two companies would be beneficial for both sets of shareholders.” Rutledge declined to give an estimate on potential cost savings from a deal but said they were “significant” and his company had told Time Warner Cable what they were. Reuters has previously reported that Liberty management had told investors that synergies could be as high as $700 million. Liberty Media, Charter’s largest stockholder, has the option to invest more equity in the company and wants to maintain its current 27 percent stake in the company. In a statement, a Liberty spokeswoman said, “We support Charter’s efforts and look forward to participating.” Rutledge said he was not in talks with Comcast Corp to get the No. 1 U.S. cable provider involved in the bidding process. Marcus at Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Comcast. “This is Charter bidding for Time Warner. That’s the only discussion we have going,” he said. Comcast, which has been seen as a candidate to bid alone or jointly for Time Warner Cable, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Time Warner has become one of the industry’s weakest performers. Leichtman Research Group estimates that over the past two years, the company lagged rivals by losing nearly 10 percent of nearly 13 million video customers. Minson, the finance chief, said Time Warner Cable would increase its capital investment this year to improve the company’s product and reliability. Charter said Goldman Sachs and Liontree Advisors were lead advisers. Guggenheim Securities was also a financial adviser to Charter. BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc are also financial advisers to Charter, and together with Goldman Sachs, are leading the financing for the transaction. The law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Kirkland & Ellis LLP are also representing Charter.

One possibility is that Charter buys all of Time Warner Cable and sells off some of its markets and subscribers to Comcast, one of the people said. It was not immediately clear which geographic markets are under discussion, but analysts have said that Comcast would be interested in Time Warner Cable’s largest markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. The two companies held similar discussions late last year but those talks did not progress at that time. Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter declined to comment. A successful tie-up would take out Comcast from the bidding for Time Warner Cable. Comcast, which has also evaluated a takeover bid for all of Time Warner Cable, was seen as the only likely suitor besides Charter. Analysts have said any attempt to merge the two largest cable operators, however, would face tough scrutiny from U.S. regulators. Securing backing from Comcast could also allow Charter, with a market capitalization of around $14 billion, to pay more for Time Warner Cable, which has a much larger market value of $38 billion. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, formally announced its $132.50 per share bid for Time Warner Cable on Monday, which the larger rival promptly rejected as too low. Time Warner Cable instead made a counter proposal worth $160 per share, including $100 in cash and the rest in stock. A number of large Time Warner Cable shareholders would support a deal with Charter if the company sweetens its bid to $145 to $150 per share, Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday. Charter has said the combined company may have to do “swaps and divestitures” of cable systems to serve regions more efficiently, according to its investor presentation on Wednesday.

443,CMCSA,Time Warner Cable deal likely to have strings attached by regulators,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Any expansion by cable provider Comcast, including a deal with Charter Communications to split provider Time Warner Cable between them, would get a tough review from U.S. regulators, who might use the proposal to force Internet providers to treat all traffic equally, antitrust experts said. Charter Communications Inc reached out to Comcast Corp this week about teaming up to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, according to people familiar with the matter. Comcast is the top U.S. cable provider and video provider, Time Warner Cable is No. 2 and Charter is the fourth largest. The Federal Communications Commission and U.S. antitrust authorities will closely scrutinize any deal between the companies since it would involve a vast range of content, video, cable and telephony. But ultimately the government would be unlikely to try to stop a deal, said Robert Doyle, an antitrust expert at Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC, who argued that some antitrust concerns could probably be remedied by strategic asset sales. “We don’t think this is one that rises to the level of a challenge,” he said, referring to a lawsuit that the Justice Department could file to stop a deal. Antitrust experts agreed, however, that any approval - particularly for Comcast - would almost certainly come with strings attached. In particular, the FCC could require the companies to treat all traffic the same, which means that companies such as Comcast with lots of content would be deterred from charging customers more if they watch movies or shows owned by other providers, such as Netflix Inc. That is no small matter. Netflix’s share price fell following Tuesday’s decision by U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to reject federal “net neutrality” rules that required Internet providers to treat all web traffic equally. Antitrust expert Jacqueline Grise of the law firm Cooley LLP said there was no guarantee a deal would be approved. The merger proposal would get a careful look from antitrust regulators, but the companies might craft a “creative solution” to satisfy the government, she said. The net neutrality condition is similar to one that Comcast was required to agree to in order to win approval for a $30 billion deal to take control of NBC Universal in 2011. Those conditions expire in 2018. Or, again echoing a condition in the 2011 deal, regulators could require Comcast to make content available to online providers, said Grise. Harold Feld of the group Public Knowledge, which campaigns for the preservation of an open Internet, agreed that the 2011 agreement could lead to similar conditions should the Time Warner transaction go ahead. “The conditions that they (regulators) would want, if I were Comcast I’m not sure I would want to take,” he said. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, formally announced its $132.50 per share bid for Time Warner Cable on Monday, which the larger rival promptly rejected as too low. Bert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, urged regulators to reject the gobbling up of Time Warner Cable. “I’m very worried about control over the pipes that allow the cable company to discriminate against content particularly in the absence of a net neutrality rule. If the deal goes through, we’re likely to see a spiral of consolidation both at the pipe end and the content end,” he said. “What’s so wrong with having Time Warner (Cable) remaining an independent company?” ",1172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-timewarnercable-comcast-antitrust/time-warner-cable-deal-likely-to-have-strings-attached-by-regulators-idUSBREA0G16V20140117

446,CMCSA,Comcast adds Barclays as adviser on Time Warner Cable deal: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp has added Barclays Plc as an adviser as it evaluates a potential deal for Time Warner Cable Inc, according to people familiar with the matter. Comcast, the top U.S. cable company, hired Barclays late last year to review its deal options, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co, which it had earlier tapped for advice, the people said. The people asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives from Comcast and Barclays declined to comment. Reuters reported on December 6 that Comcast brought in JPMorgan as speculation about cable industry consolidation increased in the prior several months. After six months of an unsuccessful pursuit, Charter Communications Inc made a formal offer to buy Time Warner Cable for $132.50 per share, or $37.3 billion, based on shares outstanding. Charter approached Comcast last week to discuss carving up Time Warner Cable’s systems and subscribers, after the second-largest U.S. cable company rejected its offer, Reuters reported. Comcast also has been weighing a bid of its own. A deal for Time Warner Cable, if consummated, would generate handsome payouts for the banks involved, as well as much-sought-after bragging rights that come with a marquee transaction. In a successful deal, banks advising Charter would split roughly $74 million to $92 million in advisory fees while Time Warner Cable’s advisers could reap $81 million to $101 million, according to preliminary estimates by consulting firm Freeman & Co LLC. Charter’s financing banks - led by Goldman Sachs Group, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group and Deutsche Bank - would also share $325 million to $445 million in financing fees, Freeman & Co estimates. Charter has said it is lining up $20.5 billion in new debt and also arranging $3.5 billion in bridge financing. Estimating potential fees for Comcast’s advisers is difficult since its deal plans are not yet public. Time Warner Cable is working with Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company and Citigroup. Charter has turned to Goldman Sachs and LionTree as lead financial advisers, and is working with other advisers that include Guggenheim Securities, Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. Charter, the No. 4 U.S. cable provider, and Comcast are in preliminary discussions about how to structure a potential alliance, Reuters reported last week. One possibility is that Charter buys all of Time Warner Cable and sells off some of its markets and subscribers to Comcast. It was not immediately clear which geographic markets are under discussion, but analysts have said that Comcast would be interested in Time Warner Cable’s largest markets, such as New York and Los Angeles. Time Warner Cable, which has said it was open to a deal at the right price - or $160 per share - considers Comcast to be the best merger partner because the larger rival can afford to make an all-cash offer and provides a better geographic fit, separate people familiar with the matter have said.

Discussions between Comcast Corp and Charter Communications Inc have gotten more substantive in recent days, partly because Comcast felt takeover target Time Warner Cable was seeking too high a price for itself, the person said on Friday. Comcast is interested in acquiring Time Warner Cable’s New York City market since it already has operations in neighboring Connecticut and New Jersey, the person added.

Los Angeles, one of Time Warner Cable’s largest markets, is less attractive to Comcast, the person said. In one scenario being discussed between the two companies, Charter would first acquire Time Warner Cable, and then later sell off markets to Comcast to generate cash. “A combined Time Warner Cable and Charter could pay off its debt quickly if it turns around and sells off some pieces to Comcast,” the person added. The timing of an agreement between Comcast and Charter was not yet known and talks could fall apart at any time, the person cautioned.

For the first time, customers with Comcast’s Xfinity TV X1 set-top box can stream live all Olympic sporting events on their televisions, through an app called NBC Sports Live Extra, as well as on tablets and mobile phones. Other pay TV subscribers can access the app only through mobile devices. More than 1,000 hours of Olympics competition, from figure skating to curling, will be streamed live from the games in Sochi, Russia, starting February 6. The online content will supplement the more than 500 hours broadcast on Comcast-owned NBC and four of its cable channels. Another 200 hours will be available through video on-demand. For the Sochi games, Comcast will try out other new features. In some markets, NBC’s prime time Olympics coverage will be available on-demand immediately after it starts, so that customers tuning in late can start at the beginning. A new feature called “SEEiT” will let people tune in to events being discussed online on Twitter. Xfinity X1 customers can click on a “SEEiT” button in a tweet to watch, or record, the event on their televisions. Others can switch to the competition on their phones or tablets. New Xfinity TV subscribers will receive immediate access to online and mobile content before any cable TV equipment is installed in their homes. Mobile and online viewing — known in the industry as TV Everywhere — surged during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. NBC streamed events live for customers who logged in with proof of a pay TV subscription, and aired tape-delayed broadcasts on TV in prime time. The media company hopes new digital features will increase Olympics viewership and help familiarize customers with its most up-to-date digital and mobile technology, said Sree Kotay, chief software architect for Comcast Cable. With a large audience focused on the games for two weeks, “we think it’s a fantastic test bed,” Kotay said in an interview. NBC spent $775 million for rights to broadcast the Sochi games and executives say they expect to make a profit. The network had brought in more than $800 million in Olympic ad revenue as of early January, NBC said at a January 7 press event.

460,CMCSA,Comcast adds video customers; NBC Universal unit improves,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) on Tuesday reported that it added more video subscribers than expected in the fourth quarter and beat cash flow estimates at its NBC Universal media unit, sending shares up more than 1 percent. Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, said it added cable video subscribers for the first time in more than six years, helping to more than offset a slight miss in quarterly profit. The 43,000 new video subscribers topped estimates of a gain of 1,600 customers, according to StreetAccount. In the third quarter, it lost 129,000 video subscribers. “Comcast’s return to positive video subscriber growth, even if it is only for a single quarter, is an unmistakable sign that their days of losing share to satellite are almost over,” said MoffettNathanson Research analyst Craig Moffett, referring to rivals DirecTV DTV.O and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O). Executives said its cloud-based “X1” video operating system as well as an increase in subscribers buying “triple-play” packages of Internet, cable and phone helped retain customers in the quarter. Comcast increased its dividend by 15 percent to 90 cents per share annually, authorized a new $7.5 billion stock repurchase program and said it would buy back $3 billion in stock this year. NBC Universal’s operating cash flow rose 14.3 percent to $1.34 billion, topping analysts’ estimates of $1.21 billion. “The reason why the stock is up is that NBCU is doing much better than what people are expecting, in terms of advertising, broadcast and at its cable networks,” Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said. While the quarterly subscriber numbers were a highlight, Comcast Cable Chief Executive Officer Neil Smit said it would be a while before the company added video customers on a full-year basis. The company said programming expenses would rise 9 percent to 10 percent in 2014, compared with a year ago as it grappled with higher fees charged by broadcasters and sports networks. Comcast will offset the costs by raising cable prices, Comcast Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis said. The company said capital expenditures will increase to 14 percent of cable revenue as it invests more in the “X1” system and expands services like Internet and phone to businesses. Smit, the cable executive, confirmed that Comcast had partnered with Cox, the third-largest cable operator, to license its X1 platform and was working with Cox to find ways to tap the product. Talks between the two was first reported by Reuters earlier Tuesday. The company is considering boosting its cable subscriber base on the U.S. East Coast and has been in talks with Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) to carve up Time Warner Cable’s cable systems, a source has told Reuters. But executives avoided any mention of its cable consolidation strategy on Tuesday. Free cash flow fell 22 percent to $1.4 billion in the quarter, compared with a year ago, due to higher capital expenditures and working capital. Comcast added 397,000 high-speed Internet customers, topping estimates of a gain of 350,000 customers. Comcast recorded fourth-quarter net income of $1.91 billion, or 72 cents a share, compared with $1.52 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year ago. Adjusted for a tax gain, the company’s earnings per share were 66 cents per share, which missed analysts’ estimates by 2 cents.

465,CMCSA,Comcast in talks to license technology to Cox -sources,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the No. 1 U.S. cable operator, is in advanced discussions about licensing its “X1” video operating system to Cox Communications, the third-largest cable operator, according to people familiar with the matter. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said on January 7 that the company is looking to license its latest cloud-based technology to other cable operators. Comcast has been in talks to provide Cox with a “white label” version of the product without using Comcast’s Xfinity product name, two sources said. The sources would not speak on the record because the talks were private. The X1 technology platform has a search function that combines shows and movies from live TV, library and content from digital video recorders. It also has an interface that is considered to be the most advanced in the cable industry, featuring Internet applications, viewing recommendations and voice control. The video product being licensed would use Comcast’s software, but would be customized to work within Cox’s cable system. Georgia-based Cox Communications is a unit of Cox Enterprises and has 4.5 million video subscribers. An agreement is not yet final so it was not clear when the two companies would have a deal in place, or how many Cox subscribers would have access to the product. Representatives for Cox and Comcast declined to comment. Comcast has invested about $2 billion in building its cloud-based platform, said Brean Capital analyst Todd Mitchell. Licensing its wares and collecting fees from other operators would help generate additional revenue from the investment. Mitchell said Comcast and Cox could also save money by using the same technology because they could buy products from the same vendors. John Malone, the chairman of Liberty Media Corp who is driving cable industry consolidation in the United States and Europe, has been calling on Comcast to share its technology with smaller players to help them compete against the satellite and telecommunications industry. Cable companies serve different markets and do not directly compete with one another.

468,CMCSA,"As Olympics loom, NBC leads in the race for prized viewers","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s NBC network, for years a ratings laggard, is ahead in a key contest among broadcasters even before it attracts millions of viewers this month to its marquee event, the Winter Olympics. “The Blacklist,” which stars James Spader as a master criminal who helps the FBI, and the second-year drama “Chicago Fire” have pushed NBC into the lead among viewers 18 to 49, the group most prized by advertisers. NBC will begin its Olympics telecast on February 6 from Sochi, Russia, boosting ratings and giving the network its biggest opportunity this season to promote its regular primetime lineup. The network’s overall ratings increased by 11 percent this season from a year earlier, to 9.2 million primetime viewers on average, according to the Nielsen ratings agency. That helped increase operating cash flow at Comcast’s broadcast segment by 54.8 percent to $140 million in the fourth quarter, the cable giant said on Tuesday. Revenue increased by 11.5 percent, to $2.2 billion in the quarter. “The turnaround in broadcast is happening even faster than we had anticipated,” Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts said in an earnings conference call with analysts. To lift the network out of the ratings basement, NBC in 2010 named Bob Greenblatt as its entertainment chairman, hiring him from premium CBS-owned cable channel Showtime after his success with shows including serial killer drama “Dexter” and “Weeds,” about a pot-dealing suburban mom. At NBC, Greenblatt added a fall season of popular singing contest “The Voice,” which he used as a lead-in to launch the drama “Revolution” last season and “Blacklist” this season. For the season that ended in May 2013, NBC finished fourth among the major broadcasters and third among ages 18 to 49. NBC now ranks second in overall viewers after CBS, which is averaging 11.4 million viewers through January 26, according to Nielsen. The agency counts viewers as those who watch live or recorded programs up to seven days later. Among viewers aged 18 to 49, NBC averages nearly 3.7 million viewers, ahead of 3.3 million for CBS. The numbers include its Sunday night NFL telecasts. “There’s little question that NBC has been turned around,” said Tom Eagan, an analyst Northland Securities, who rates Comcast “outperform.” “Blacklist,” starring James Spader as one of the FBI’s most-wanted fugitives, is the season’s top-rated new series and 12th overall, attracting an average of 14.1 million viewers. “Chicago Fire” improved Tuesday 10 p.m. ratings by 21 percent, according to Nielsen figures made available by NBC. Its audience averages 10.6 million. “We have some real momentum this year,” said NBC’s Greenblatt said on January 19 at a Television Critics Association meeting, where the network promoted its upcoming shows. The network is entering year three of a three- to five-year turnaround effort, he said. Greenblatt acknowledged programming challenges on Thursday night, where comedies including “The Michael J. Fox Show” have scored low ratings. He said NBC had taken steps to avoid a repeat of last season, when it enjoyed a strong fall only to see ratings drop after “Sunday Night Football” ended, and “The Voice” and “Revolution” took a break for several weeks mid-season. This year, “Blacklist” is staying on the air through January, and NBC debuted “Chicago Fire” spinoff “Chicago P.D.” on January 8. “The Voice” will return after the Olympics, on February 24.

470,CMCSA,Comcast beefs up online offering with Warner Brothers movies,"Feb 11 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp will offer its subscribers the option to buy “Gravity” and other Warner Brothers movies for download and streaming, expanding the largest U.S. cable operator’s push into digital movie sales, the company said on Tuesday. Comcast began selling digital movies in November and already offers titles from Lions Gate Entertainment Corp, 20th Century Fox and Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast. Customers can buy the films through Comcast’s Xfinity TV platform, which allows subscribers to watch content on any device, sometimes weeks ahead of a movie’s DVD release. Warner Brothers films available for download include “42,” “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy and “The Hangover Part III,” the two companies said in a statement. “Gravity” will be available starting Tuesday, and other Warner Brothers movies and TV shows will follow in the coming weeks. The agreement was the second of the day by Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner Inc, to license its content. In a separate announcement, it said it would license “Tom and Jerry” and other shows from its Warner Brothers Animation studio to German subscribers of LOVEFiLM, an Amazon.com Inc  owned film subscription service with more than 2 million members in Britain and Germany.",2112014,http://www.reuters.com/article/comcast-movies/comcast-beefs-up-online-offering-with-warner-brothers-movies-idUSL2N0LG1MM20140211
471,CMCSA,Comcast takeover of Time Warner Cable to reshape U.S. pay TV,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s proposed $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc could face close scrutiny from U.S. antitrust regulators because of the deal’s potential to reshape the country’s pay TV and broadband markets. The company resulting from the merger of the top two U.S. cable service providers would boast a footprint spanning from New York to Los Angeles, with a near 30 percent share of the pay TV market as well as a strong position in providing broadband Internet services. The all-stock deal, announced on Thursday, would put Comcast in 19 of the 20 largest U.S. TV markets, and could give it unprecedented leverage in negotiations with content providers and advertisers. The friendly takeover came as a surprise after months of public pursuit of Time Warner Cable by smaller rival Charter Communications Inc, and immediately raised questions as to whether it would be blocked by the Department of Justice or the Federal Communications Commission. Time Warner Cable shares jumped 6.8 percent to $144.50, still substantially short of the $158.82 per share value that Comcast put on its offer, indicating investors’ worries about regulatory clearance. Comcast shares fell 3.5 percent, cutting the per-share offer value to $154. “I don’t know if the deal is too big to fail to be approved but it is definitely too big to sail through either the Department of Justice or the FCC without serious, serious examination,” said former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt. “Only Comcast could have paid this price and the combined company, if approved, would tilt the balance of power at every negotiating table in media and content and broadband and equipment industries.” Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said he was confident about getting the green light from regulators as the two companies plan to divest 3 million subscribers, so that their combined customer base of 30 million would represent just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market. He said no decisions have been made on which markets to sell. The new cable giant would still tower over U.S. satellite competitor DirecTV, which has about 20 million video customers. Comcast argued that the acquisition would be beneficial to consumers in that it would roll out its more advanced cloud-based set-top boxes to Time Warner Cable customers. It also said the deal would eventually result in higher broadband speeds. “Significantly, it will not reduce competition in any relevant market be because our companies do not overlap or compete with each other,” Roberts said. “In fact, we do not operate in any of the same zip code.” The new partners are concentrated in different cities. Comcast would fill in its New Jersey and Connecticut portfolio with Time Warner Cable’s New York City customers, for instance, and add major markets such as Los Angeles and Dallas. Hedge fund manager John Paulson, whose Paulson & Co is one of Time Warner Cable’s top 10 shareholders, called the merger “a dream combination.” If successful, the deal will be the second time in little more than a year that Comcast has helped reshape the U.S. media landscape after its $17 billion acquisition of NBC Universal was completed in 2013. “The negative is that NBC Universal ownership further complicates regulatory approval with implications even for usage-based pricing,” Wunderlich Securities Matthew Harrigan said in a research note. Representatives for the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department could not be reached for comment. Comcast’s offer price is roughly what Time Warner Cable demanded from Charter and a 17 percent premium from the No. 2 cable provider’s closing price on Wednesday. Charter shares slid 6.2 percent. Comcast and Time Warner Cable expect to create $1.5 billion in operating savings, with 50 percent of those savings expected in the first year. The proposed deal will be accretive to Comcast, which plans to expand its stock buyback program to $10 billion at the close of the transaction. Comcast is interested in advertising synergies it would gain by owning the New York City market as well as the opportunity to expand its business services unit, its fastest-growing cable division, to a larger footprint. “For Comcast, adding New York and Los Angeles has advertising potential, along with Time Warner Cable’s sports assets, which provides an acquisition target that is simply too compelling to ignore, especially with an (under-leveraged) balance sheet,” said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. The two companies expect to close the deal, which would give roughly 23 percent of the merged company to Time Warner Cable shareholders, by the end of the year. Unusually for a transaction of this size, there is no break-up fee. Analysts noted that smaller cable operator Charter, which went hostile this week by nominating a slate of directors to replace the entire board of Time Warner Cable, could still be a candidate to acquire some of the assets to be divested.

472,CMCSA,CORRECTED-UPDATE 7-Comcast takeover of Time Warner Cable to reshape U.S. pay TV,"(Corrects paragraph one stock symbol for Comcast. The error first occurred in Update 1) By Liana B. Baker Feb 13 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s proposed $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc could face close scrutiny from U.S. antitrust regulators because of the deal’s potential to reshape the country’s pay TV and broadband markets. The company resulting from the merger of the top two U.S. cable service providers would boast a footprint spanning from New York to Los Angeles, with a near 30 percent share of the pay TV market as well as a strong position in providing broadband Internet services. The all-stock deal, announced on Thursday, would put Comcast in 19 of the 20 largest U.S. TV markets, and could give it unprecedented leverage in negotiations with content providers and advertisers. The friendly takeover came as a surprise after months of public pursuit of Time Warner Cable by smaller rival Charter Communications Inc, and immediately raised questions as to whether it would be blocked by the Department of Justice or the Federal Communications Commission. Time Warner Cable shares jumped 6.8 percent to $144.50, still substantially short of the $158.82 per share value that Comcast put on its offer, indicating investors’ worries about regulatory clearance. Comcast shares fell 3.5 percent, cutting the per-share offer value to $154. “I don’t know if the deal is too big to fail to be approved but it is definitely too big to sail through either the Department of Justice or the FCC without serious, serious examination,” said former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt. “Only Comcast could have paid this price and the combined company, if approved, would tilt the balance of power at every negotiating table in media and content and broadband and equipment industries.” Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said he was confident about getting the green light from regulators as the two companies plan to divest 3 million subscribers, so that their  combined customer base of 30 million would represent just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market. He said no decisions have been made on which markets to sell. The new cable giant would still tower over U.S. satellite competitor DirecTV, which has about 20 million video customers. Comcast argued that the acquisition would be beneficial to consumers in that it would roll out its more advanced cloud-based set-top boxes to Time Warner Cable customers. It also said the deal would eventually result in higher broadband speeds. “Significantly, it will not reduce competition in any relevant market be because our companies do not overlap or compete with each other,” Roberts said. “In fact, we do not operate in any of the same zip code.” The new partners are concentrated in different cities. Comcast would fill in its New Jersey and Connecticut portfolio with Time Warner Cable’s New York City customers, for instance, and add major markets such as Los Angeles and Dallas. Hedge fund manager John Paulson, whose Paulson & Co is one of Time Warner Cable’s top 10 shareholders, called the merger “a dream combination.” If successful, the deal will be the second time in little more than a year that Comcast has helped reshape the U.S. media landscape after its $17 billion acquisition of NBC Universal was completed in 2013. “The negative is that NBC Universal ownership further complicates regulatory approval with implications even for usage-based pricing,” Wunderlich Securities Matthew Harrigan said in a research note. Representatives for the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department could not be reached for comment. Comcast’s offer price is roughly what Time Warner Cable demanded from Charter and a 17 percent premium from the No. 2 cable provider’s closing price on Wednesday. Charter shares slid 6.2 percent. Comcast and Time Warner Cable expect to create $1.5 billion in operating savings, with 50 percent of those savings expected in the first year. The proposed deal will be accretive to Comcast, which plans to expand its stock buyback program to $10 billion at the close of the transaction.

473,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-Time Warner Cable bonds snap tighter on Comcast deal,"By Danielle Robinson Feb 13 (IFR) - The bond spreads of Time Warner Cable  tightened sharply Thursday, as did the cost of insuring the company’s debt against default, after news it would be acquired by Comcast. TWC’s bonds had tightened by 145bp by midday on Thursday on word of the US$45.2bn all-stock deal merging the two largest US cable operators into a media colossus. Its 4.00% 2021s were trading at 76bp bid, in a whopping 145bp from 221bp on Wednesday before the deal was announced. “TWC bonds were trading at junk and now they are looking at the possibility of an A rating,” Moody’s senior analyst Neil Begley told IFR. “It’s amazing.” The deal seems to have foiled the hopes of cable pioneer John Malone, who had waged a bitter eight-month battle to acquire TWC by Charter Communications, whose biggest shareholder is his Liberty Media Corp. Bondholders had feared a takeover by double-B rated Charter would have over-leveraged the new entity and sent some US$25bn of TWC bonds into junk-ratings territory. “Comcast is just a much better credit than Charter,” said one syndicate manager. “Simple as that.” Comcast is rated A3/A-/A- by Moody’s, S&P; and Fitch. “This deal won’t change Comcast’s rating,” said Begley from Moody’s, which announced it was taking TWC’s Baa2 rating off review for downgrade and putting it on review for upgrade. “It’s more a question of whether we would raise the TWC rating,” he said. The deal still needs regulatory approval. TWC’s credit default swaps - the cost, in other words, of insuring the company’s debt against default - also tightened dramatically on Thursday in response. Its five-year CDS tightened around 108bp - a whopping 60% - to around 74bp in another sign of the favorable reaction to the deal, which caught many in the market by surprise. Malone’s Charter Communications had been dialling up the pressure to get TWC in recent days. Charter offered US$132.50 per share in a deal that would have seen the combined company’s leverage soar from around 3.5 times earnings to seven times. After TWC chairman and chief executive Robert Marcus and his management team rejected the Charter offer outright, Charter effectively declared war by nominating 13 independent directors to wipe out TWC’s existing board. That move would have meant a full-scale proxy battle at TWC’s shareholder meeting in May. Begley of Moody’s said the tie-up with Comcast would likely generate more than double the cost savings of a deal with Charter. “We think the combined company could benefit from as much as US$1bn of cost savings, because Comcast’s cable operating cash flow margins were about 500bp greater than TWC’s last year,” he said. The Comcast-TWC deal could also reap major commercial opportunities, as it will create a customer reach that would rival that of telecom giants AT&T; and Verizon. Because Comcast’s acquisition is intended to be an all-cash deal, some leveraged finance bankers will miss out on the fees from the debt that likely would have been needed to push through a deal with Charter.",2132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/timewarnercable-credit/update-2-time-warner-cable-bonds-snap-tighter-on-comcast-deal-idUSL2N0LI10C20140213
474,CMCSA,"Banks set to earn $143 million in Comcast, Time Warner Cable deal fees","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s proposed $45.2 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc would generate as much as $143 million in investment banking fees, providing a rare boon to Wall Street banks grappling with a dearth of large corporate takeovers. JPMorgan Chase & Co, former top Morgan Stanley banker Paul Taubman and Barclays, which together advised Comcast, would split an estimated $51 million to $68 million in advisory fees if the proposed deal goes through, according to estimates by Freeman & Co LLC. Financial advisers to Time Warner Cable - Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company, Citigroup Inc and Centerview Partners - are set to share $57 million to $75 million in fees, the estimates show. However, a number of other banks backing a rival bidder, Charter Communications Inc, would likely miss out on the several hundred millions of dollars in potential fees. Because Charter’s cash and stock offer for Time Warner Cable, unlike Comcast’s all-stock bid, involved a large borrowing, banks advising Charter could have earned more than $500 million in advisory and financing fees, according to Freeman & Co estimates in January. Charter, which made a hostile $37.3 billion bid for Time Warner Cable, was working with Goldman Sachs Group, LionTree, Guggenheim Securities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group and Deutsche Bank. The proposed combination between Comcast and Time Warner Cable is this year’s biggest transaction globally, and the largest since Verizon Communications Inc’s $130 billion deal last year to buy out Vodafone Group Plc’s stake in Verizon Wireless. The deal is also yet another coup for Paul Taubman, who is advising key corporate clients on his own after leaving Morgan Stanley in early 2013. The former co-head of Morgan Stanley’s institutional securities unit left the Wall Street firm after it became clear that Chief Executive James Gorman planned to choose his long-time rival Colm Kelleher as the sole head of the unit. Taubman was the No. 13 mergers adviser in 2013 globally thanks to his role advising Verizon on the buyout of the Verizon Wireless stake, putting him ahead of entire banks such as Evercore Partners, Moelis & Co and Jefferies in the coveted league table of financial advisers.

Comcast has used the New York-based law firm repeatedly for antitrust matters, most notably its successful bid to buy a majority of NBC Universal from General Electric Co (GE.N). A team of Davis Polk lawyers helped win U.S. Justice Department approval for that deal in January 2011. The two cable giants are proposing a $45.2 billion combination that is likely to face scrutiny from antitrust enforcers because of the deal’s potential to reshape pay TV and broadband markets in the United States. The antitrust team will be led by Arthur Burke, a Comcast spokeswoman said. Burke is a member of Davis Polk’s litigation department, according to the firm’s website. Burke was involved in the 2011 settlement with the Justice Department which allowed Comcast to take control of NBC Universal. In a news release, the companies said that Comcast’s legal advisers were Davis Polk as well as Willkie Farr & Gallagher and that Time Warner Cable’s legal advisers were Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The firms all declined to comment on their roles. Two of the firms worked with the same clients in at least one past lawsuit. In 2006, the America Channel, a cable network dedicated to telling the personal stories of Americans, sued Comcast and Time Warner Cable, alleging that they violated federal antitrust law by refusing to carry the channel. A U.S. District Court judge in Minnesota dismissed the lawsuit the next year. Davis Polk represented Comcast, while Paul, Weiss represented Time Warner Cable. Davis Polk has also worked for Comcast in an ongoing antitrust class action in federal court in Philadelphia, where local subscribers have accused the company of running an illegal monopoly. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated an order for class certification and sent the case back to U.S. District Court, where a new motion for certification is pending. Another lawyer who worked on the Comcast-NBC deal was Bill Baer, who at the time was a partner at Arnold & Porter representing General Electric, which then owned NBC Universal. Baer is now the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, setting up a potential reunion at the negotiating table if the Justice Department turns out to be the agency that reviews the latest Comcast deal. The Justice Department shares antitrust review authority with the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. While the FCC is almost certain to be involved, it was not certain on Thursday which of the other two would be. Baer listed his involvement in the 2011 settlement as one of his “significant legal activities” in a questionnaire he filled out for the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee before his confirmation to the Justice Department post. He assumed his office in January 2013. Lawyers with expertise in conflicts of interests said on Thursday that Baer’s work on the Comcast-NBC-GE deal was unlikely to require his disqualification now. His client in the earlier matter was GE, which is not a party to the proposed merger. Government lawyers are generally prohibited from working on matters that they handled while in private practice. “The GE work - selling NBC to Comcast - is a different matter than Comcast’s acquisition of Time Warner Cable. So I don’t see any problem,” Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University, said in an email. The Justice Department declined to comment on Baer’s role.

483,CMCSA,CORRECTED-Comcast again turns to Davis Polk for Time Warner Cable antitrust case,"(Changes Time Warner to Time Warner Cable in headline and paragraphs 4, 6, 7) By David Ingram WASHINGTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp will again be working with its longtime antitrust counsel at Davis Polk & Wardwell, as the communications and entertainment group seeks to navigate the U.S. approval process to merge with rival Time Warner Cable Inc. Comcast has used the New York-based law firm repeatedly for antitrust matters, most notably its successful bid beginning in 2009 to buy a majority of NBC Universal from General Electric Co . A team of Davis Polk lawyers helped win U.S. Justice Department approval for that deal in January 2011. The two cable giants are proposing a $45.2 billion combination that is likely to face scrutiny from antitrust enforcers because of the deal’s potential to reshape pay TV and broadband markets in the United States. In a news release, the companies said that Comcast’s legal advisers were Davis Polk as well as Willkie Farr & Gallagher and that Time Warner Cable’s legal advisers were Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The firms all declined to comment on their roles. Two of the firms worked with the same clients in at least one past lawsuit. In 2006, the America Channel, a cable network dedicated to telling the personal stories of Americans, sued Comcast and Time Warner Cable alleging that they violated federal antitrust law by refusing to carry the channel. A U.S. District Court judge in Minnesota dismissed the suit the next year. Davis Polk represented Comcast, while Paul, Weiss represented Time Warner Cable. Davis Polk has also worked for Comcast in an ongoing antitrust class action in federal court in Philadelphia, where local subscribers have accused the company of running an illegal monopoly. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated an order for class certification and sent the case back to U.S. District Court, where a new motion for certification is pending. Arthur Burke, a partner at Davis Polk in New York, has most often been involved in Comcast’s antitrust cases, including the 2011 settlement with the Justice Department over NBC Universal. He did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Another lawyer who worked on the Comcast-NBC deal was Bill Baer, who at the time was a partner at Arnold & Porter representing General Electric, the seller of NBC Universal to Comcast. Baer is now the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, setting up a potential reunion at the negotiating table if the Justice Department turns out to be the agency that reviews the latest Comcast deal. The Justice Department shares antitrust review authority with the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. While the FCC is almost certain to be involved, it was not certain on Thursday which of the other two would be. Baer listed his involvement in the 2011 settlement as one of his “significant legal activities” in a questionnaire he filled out for the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee before his confirmation to the Justice Department post. He assumed his office in January 2013. Lawyers with expertise in conflicts of interests said on Thursday that Baer’s work on the Comcast-NBC-GE deal was unlikely to require his disqualification now. His client in the earlier matter was GE, which is not a party to the proposed merger. Government lawyers are generally prohibited from working on matters that they handled while in private practice. “The GE work - selling NBC to Comcast - is a different matter than Comcast’s acquisition of Time Warner Cable. So I don’t see any problem,” Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University, said in an email. The Justice Department declined to comment on Baer’s role.

484,CMCSA,RPT-Massive cable deal would make Comcast too powerful for some,"(Repeats story with no change to text) By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Consumer advocates and U.S. lawmakers are worried that Comcast Corp’s proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc will create a company with too much power to decide what Americans can watch on television and do online, and they expect intense regulatory scrutiny of the deal. Their concerns are intertwined with a recent court decision to overturn U.S. open Internet rules, which enforced the principle that Internet service providers should treat all Web traffic equally and should not give preferential treatment to their own movies, websites and content. Comcast, a major provider of Internet services, is committed to network neutrality until 2018. Separately, some media companies are concerned that Comcast would attempt to pay them less for their television shows, movies and other content, and have scheduled discussions with their attorneys with an eye toward lobbying regulators in Washington, said an antitrust attorney who spoke privately to protect business relationships. Comcast’s proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable would combine the country’s top two cable providers into a colossus that could reshape the U.S. pay television and broadband Internet industry. The deal would put Comcast in 19 of the nation’s 20 largest TV markets. The deal will be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission and either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, the two agencies that share antitrust oversight in the United States. Eight antitrust experts interviewed by Reuters were split  on whether the merger would be approved. While Comcast has agreed to divest 3 million Time Warner Cable subscribers to keep their combined share of the U.S. pay television market at under 30 percent, it is unclear if that is enough to satisfy antitrust regulators, the experts said. A Comcast-Time Warner combination could be especially troubling in light of the court ruling that struck down FCC rules aimed at preventing broadband service providers from favoring one website over another, said Bert Foer, head of the American Antitrust Institute. “I hope it (the deal) is going to be fought tooth and nail,” said Foer. “You’re creating this giant and you’re doing it in the absence of a network neutrality rule. That’s dangerous to democracy.” Foer said that agreements between Comcast and federal agencies that were put in place at the time of the Comcast and NBC Universal merger in 2011 to assure network neutrality would end in 2018 and were nothing more than a “short-term bandage.” The advocacy group Consumer Watchdog bluntly called on the FCC and Department of Justice to block the creation of “an unjustifiable monopoly” that could raise prices to customers and would have “no incentive to improve broadband service.” Antitrust authorities often challenge mergers or extract concessions when head-to-head competition would be diluted, although there are few areas of the United States where two cable companies compete directly. Reed Hundt, FCC chairman during the Clinton administration, said the current spotlight on the issue of open internet principles meant the commission would carefully examine the size and power of the new combined company. “The FCC will look at that broadband market share and they will say, ‘Chairman Wheeler promised an open internet, what does this deal mean for that?’” he said. “The FCC will take a hard look at what is the durable, long-lasting, truly open internet commitment,” Hundt said. Robert McDowell, a former FCC commissioner who voted to approve Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal, said the company could be asked to extend its net neutrality commitment, and if they do so, chances of approval are good. “Comcast understood going into this that they’ll have to agree to at least all of the same merger conditions that were put into the NBC merger deal plus some other things too. They will probably see an extension of the term of those conditions,” McDowell said. Amy Klobuchar, chairwoman of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, promised a hearing “to carefully scrutinize the details of this merger and its potential consequences.” No date has been set so far. The Republican-run House Judiciary Committee is also expected to hold a hearing “to ensure that the interests of American consumers and overall competition in the marketplace is protected.” Senator Al Franken was a critic of Comcast’s previous deal with NBC Universal. On Thursday he wrote to both FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and top U.S. antitrust officials with “serious reservations” about Comcast’s latest move. “A handful of cable providers dominate the market, leaving consumers with little choice but to pay high bills for often unsatisfactory service. I am concerned that Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner would only make things worse,” wrote Franken, a Minnesota Democrat. The Justice Department has stopped a couple of notable deals recently, particularly a proposed merger of AT&T; with T-Mobile USA. Other deals it sued to stop - like the Anheuser-Busch InBev  deal to buy Grupo Modelo and US Airways merger with American Airlines - were allowed to go ahead after the companies pledged big asset sales. The companies maintain that customers will benefit from the merger as services and technology improves. “This transaction is pro-consumer, pro-competitive and approvable,” said Comcast executive vice president David Cohen. However, “we’re certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly,” he added. Wall Street analysts said the deal would give Comcast a stronger hand in negotiations with content providers such as Walt Disney Co, CBS Corp and Fox. Media companies collectively receive billions of dollars a year from pay TV operators for their programming. “Content providers would face a negotiating behemoth with close to 30 million subscribers that, oh by the way, is vertically integrated with a direct competitor (NBC Universal),” Moffett Nathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note to clients. “Expect them to complain vehemently.” A Disney spokesman did not respond to requests for comment, and Fox had no comment. CBS’ chief executive Les Moonves said in a CNBC interview that “if you have the right content, you’re always going to have the (pricing) power.” The deal has generated “considerable opposition” among programmers who fear they will be offered less money for their content, said the antitrust attorney. “This is a very problematic deal. ... And I don’t know if it can be corrected,” he said.

485,CMCSA,RPT-DEALTALK-How Charter's Time Warner Cable bid woke up a 'sleeping beast',"(Repeats with no changes ( By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Talks between Comcast Corp  and Charter Communications Inc over how they could together buy Time Warner Cable Inc quickly soured as the two bickered over price and the feasibility of engineering a split of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, had been pursuing Time Warner for months, but was not making any headway as its larger rival - nearly three times its size by market value - asked for $8 billion more than what it had offered. But Comcast actually believed Time Warner Cable’s $160 per share counter to Charter’s $132.50 per share bid was reasonable, several people familiar with the situation said on Thursday. At the same time, it worried that splitting a public company with assets in multiple markets and millions of subscribers would be tough, made even harder by the acrimony that had built up over the past eight months between Charter and Time Warner Cable. On Feb. 4 Comcast and Charter met in a last-ditch attempt to see if they could work out their differences, the sources said. They could not. So later in the day, Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts called Time Warner Cable’s Rob Marcus to say that he was ready to make a bid for all of Time Warner Cable at a figure close to the asking price, according to the sources. On Thursday, the two announced a $45.2 billion all-stock deal to create a cable behemoth, with an empire stretching from New York to Los Angeles. The deal is the largest M&A; transaction so far this year and the third-largest in the media and entertainment sector of all time, according to Thomson Reuters data. If the deal closes, it could give Comcast unprecedented leverage in negotiations with content providers and advertisers. For that reason it is also likely to come under keen regulatory scrutiny. Representatives for Time Warner Cable, Comcast and Charter declined to comment on details of the negotiations. All the sources asked not to be named because the conversations were private. Interviews with several people who were intimately involved in negotiations, however, paint a picture of what went on behind the scenes over the last few days as the deal came together and how Charter lost a prize that it had worked so hard to win. In some ways, these sources said, the two companies have Charter to thank for the deal. Although Comcast, the top U.S. cable operator, had always been intrigued by the idea of buying Time Warner Cable, a deal was not on its list of priorities until Charter put it in play last summer. In the end, one of the sources said, all Charter did was “wake up the sleeping beast.” John Paulson, whose Paulson & Co hedge fund is one of Time Warner Cable’s top 10 shareholders, said of Comcast in an interview with Reuters: “They’re gentlemen, old school businessmen. But they’re also aggressive.” Charter’s next steps were not clear on Thursday. It had nominated a slate of directors to replace the entire board of Time Warner Cable on Tuesday, but was kept in the dark as its prize was slipping away to another buyer. Time Warner Cable CEO Marcus, in the job for just 44 days, said in an interview that the deal, while good for his shareholders, is bittersweet for him. “I was looking forward to thousands of days, not tens of days doing this job,” Marcus said. Still, the former Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP M&A; lawyer who over the past eight years had served in various roles at Time Warner Cable, including its top dealmaker and chief operating officer, just pulled off one of his largest deals ever. And thanks to his tenure at the company, he could take home some $50 million after it closes. “Sometimes you don’t have control over how things unfold,” Marcus said. Things moved quickly over the last 10 days, the sources said. After months of pursuing Time Warner Cable without success and speaking informally with Comcast last year, Charter approached Comcast once again in the middle of January about teaming up. The idea was for Charter to buy all of Time Warner Cable and later sell off select systems to Comcast. Comcast, with a $138 billion market value, dwarfs Charter’s $13.43 billion, as well as Time Warner Cable’s $40 billion market capitalization as of Thursday. But as the two discussed options, Comcast became increasingly uncomfortable with Charter’s hostile approach and more skeptical that Charter would be able to win Time Warner Cable’s blessing with its offer, the sources said. Comcast also became increasingly excited about the prospect of buying Time Warner Cable on its own. Comcast felt that it could pay between $150 and $160 per share for Time Warner Cable, the sources said. Initially it was also willing to put cash along with stock into the deal. But one of the sources said Time Warner Cable wanted an all-stock deal and for Comcast to use the cash instead to initiate a large share buyback program after the transaction closed to boost the share price of the combined company. That meant Time Warner Cable shareholders would end up owning 23 percent of the combined company and also not have to pay taxes as a result of the transaction. In return for paying the price, however, Roberts had one demand: Comcast would not pay a reverse break-up fee, or the penalty that a buyer pays to the seller if it fails to close a deal, typically because of regulatory reasons, the sources said. The request was unusual for a deal that was sure to face regulatory scrutiny. A few years ago, for example, AT&T; Inc  agreed to pay as much as $6 billion as reverse breakup fee, paid in cash and spectrum, as part of its deal to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion. The deal was shot down by regulators, and AT&T; had to pay the fees. Some lawyers said such fees are rare in the cable industry, however. “These businesses operate fairly independent enough and if this deal does not get approved, there is not going to be that much damage to Time Warner Cable,” said Robert Townsend, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster’s global M&A; practice. Comcast CEO Roberts said he did not recall ever agreeing to a reverse termination fee, not even in its $30 billion buyout of majority of NBC Universal in 2009. Time Warner Cable’s board determined that the proposed transaction should get regulatory approval because the companies do not operate in the same markets, the sources said. They agreed to Comcast’s condition. Talks were further aided by the fact that executives from the two companies knew each other and were friendly, the sources said. They also had worked together on a deal previously. In 2006, the two split up bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications in a complicated $17.6 billion transaction. Marcus was Time Warner’s lead negotiator on the deal at that time. This time around, the two chief executives, along with Comcast Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis and Time Warner Cable’s Arthur Minson, negotiated key points of the deal by phone as well as in-person meetings in New York, without relying much on advisers. The two sides agreed a final deal price of $158.82 per share on Monday morning, and the board of each company approved the transaction on Wednesday evening. “Throughout the whole process with Charter, I consistently said one thing - insufficient value. They didn’t value the unique asset that was Time Warner Cable,” Marcus said. “On the simplest level, the TWC-Comcast merger was superior.”",2142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/timewarnercable-comcast/rpt-dealtalk-how-charters-time-warner-cable-bid-woke-up-a-sleeping-beast-idUSL2N0LJ04D20140214

That’s dangerous to democracy.” Foer said that agreements between Comcast and federal agencies that were put in place at the time of the Comcast and NBC Universal merger in 2011 to assure network neutrality would end in 2018 and were nothing more than a “short-term bandage.” The advocacy group Consumer Watchdog bluntly called on the FCC and Department of Justice to block the creation of “an unjustifiable monopoly” that could raise prices to customers and would have “no incentive to improve broadband service.” Antitrust authorities often challenge mergers or extract concessions when head-to-head competition would be diluted, although there are few areas of the United States where two cable companies compete directly. Reed Hundt, FCC chairman during the Clinton administration, said the current spotlight on the issue of open internet principles meant the commission would carefully examine the size and power of the new combined company. “The FCC will look at that broadband market share and they will say, ‘Chairman Wheeler promised an open internet, what does this deal mean for that?’” he said. “The FCC will take a hard look at what is the durable, long-lasting, truly open internet commitment,” Hundt said. Robert McDowell, a former FCC commissioner who voted to approve Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal, said the company could be asked to extend its net neutrality commitment, and if they do so, chances of approval are good. “Comcast understood going into this that they’ll have to agree to at least all of the same merger conditions that were put into the NBC merger deal plus some other things too. They will probably see an extension of the term of those conditions,” McDowell said. Amy Klobuchar, chairwoman of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, promised a hearing “to carefully scrutinize the details of this merger and its potential consequences.” No date has been set so far. The Republican-run House Judiciary Committee is also expected to hold a hearing “to ensure that the interests of American consumers and overall competition in the marketplace is protected.” Senator Al Franken was a critic of Comcast’s previous deal with NBC Universal. On Thursday he wrote to both FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and top U.S. antitrust officials with “serious reservations” about Comcast’s latest move. “A handful of cable providers dominate the market, leaving consumers with little choice but to pay high bills for often unsatisfactory service. I am concerned that Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner would only make things worse,” wrote Franken, a Minnesota Democrat. The Justice Department has stopped a couple of notable deals recently, particularly a proposed merger of AT&T; with T-Mobile USA. Other deals it sued to stop - like the Anheuser-Busch InBev  deal to buy Grupo Modelo and US Airways merger with American Airlines - were allowed to go ahead after the companies pledged big asset sales. The companies maintain that customers will benefit from the merger as services and technology improves. “This transaction is pro-consumer, pro-competitive and approvable,” said Comcast executive vice president David Cohen. However, “we’re certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly,” he added. Wall Street analysts said the deal would give Comcast a stronger hand in negotiations with content providers such as Walt Disney Co, CBS Corp and Fox. Media companies collectively receive billions of dollars a year from pay TV operators for their programming. “Content providers would face a negotiating behemoth with close to 30 million subscribers that, oh by the way, is vertically integrated with a direct competitor (NBC Universal),” Moffett Nathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note to clients. “Expect them to complain vehemently.” A Disney spokesman did not respond to requests for comment, and Fox had no comment. CBS’ chief executive Les Moonves said in a CNBC interview that “if you have the right content, you’re always going to have the (pricing) power.” The deal has generated “considerable opposition” among programmers who fear they will be offered less money for their content, said the antitrust attorney. “This is a very problematic deal. ... And I don’t know if it can be corrected,” he said.

489,CMCSA,Fitch Rates Comcast's Sr. Unsecured Notes 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Comcast Corporation's (Comcast) benchmark size, senior unsecured notes maturing  2024 and 2044. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for general  corporate purposes which may include the repayment of amounts outstanding under  the company's commercial paper program and a portion of NBCUniversal's $900  million principal amount of 2.1% notes due April 2014. The notes will be  guaranteed by Comcast's subsidiaries included in the company's cross-guaranty  structure. The Rating Outlook for all of Comcast's ratings is Stable. As of Dec.  31, 2013 Comcast had approximately $48.6 billion of debt outstanding, including  $11.2 billion outstanding at NBCUniversal Media, LLC (NBCUniversal). KEY RATING DRIVERS --Comcast's pending merger with TWC is strategically sound and creates  significant opportunity to realize operating and capital spending efficiencies  with minimal execution risk and enables the combined entity to effectively  compete on a national scale for incremental commercial segment business.   --The all-stock consideration structure of the merger with TWC is not expected  to have a material impact on Comcast's credit protection measures. --Comcast's capital structure and financial strategy remains intact and centered  on reducing leverage to its target of between 1.5x and 2.0x.  --Fitch does not expect any material change to Comcast's capital allocation  strategy over the near term and believes there is sufficient capacity within the  ratings to accommodate a contemplated expansion of Comcast's share repurchase  authorization. Comcast's ratings reflect its strong competitive position as one of the largest  video, high-speed Internet and phone providers to residential and business  customers in the U.S. and the company's compelling subscriber clustering  profile. In Fitch's view, NBCUniversal's size, scale, leading brand positions,  and diversity of operations and business risk as one of the world's leading  media and entertainment companies, all lower the business risk attributable to  Comcast's credit profile. These factors also create new avenues for revenue and  cash flow growth while limiting the near-term impact on Comcast's balance sheet  and credit profile.  The pending merger with TWC enables Comcast to extend its operating strategies  and technology roadmap into TWC's operations, creating the opportunity to  realize material operating cost and capital spending efficiencies.  Fitch points  out that Comcast's cable-segment EBITDA margin was nearly 500 basis points  higher than the comparable TWC EBITDA margin during the year ended 2013.   Comcast's ability to successfully establish its key operating strategies within  TWC's legacy operations creates a potential $1 billion EBITDA benefit for the  combined entity.  Additionally, the national scope of the combined entities'  cable infrastructure will position the company to effectively compete for a  higher tier commercial business.  Combined commercial-segment revenues totaled  approximately $5.5 billion during 2013, representing the second-fastest growing  business segment of the combined entity.  Fitch anticipates the merger with TWC  will close by the end of 2014.   Fitch estimates that approximately $73.6 billion of debt and preferred stock was  outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2013 on a pro forma basis translating into pro forma  leverage of 2.5x.  The pro forma leverage represents a modest increase relative  to Comcast's actual leverage of 2.2x (Fitch calculation).  Fitch expects  Comcast's credit profile will strengthen on a pro forma basis with consolidated  pro forma leverage of 2.2x by year-end 2014, approaching 2x by the end of 2015  in the absence of significant cost or operating synergies. Comcast's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility are strong based  on Fitch's expectation that the company will continue to generate material  amounts of free cash flow (FCF). Fitch acknowledges that Comcast's share  repurchase program represents a significant use of cash; however, Fitch believes  that the company would reduce the level of share repurchases should the  operating environment materially change, in order to maximize financial  flexibility. The liquidity position is further supported by cash on hand (which  totaled $1.7 billion on a consolidated basis as of Dec. 31, 2013) and $4.7  billion of collective available borrowing capacity (as of Dec. 31, 2013) from  Comcast's two revolving credit facilities. Commitments under Comcast's $6.25  billion revolver will expire during June 2017 while the commitments related to  NBCUniversal Enterprise's $1.35 billion revolver expire during March 2018.  Comcast's debt maturity profile is well-laddered and within Fitch's FCF  expectation. Maturities total approximately $1.9 billion during 2014 (including  $900 million at NBCUniversal Media) excluding outstanding commercial paper,  followed by $3.4 billion during 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES: --A positive rating action would likely coincide with Comcast achieving and  committing to a financial policy consistent with an 'A' rating, including  maintaining its leverage below 1.5x on a sustained basis. Comcast would need to  demonstrate that its operating profile will not materially decline in the face  of competition and less than robust housing and employment conditions.  --Negative rating actions would likely coincide with discretionary actions of  Comcast's management including, but not limited to, the company adopting a more  aggressive financial strategy, or event-driven merger and acquisition activity,  that drive leverage beyond 2.5x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan.

490,CMCSA,Comcast filings with regulators expected at end of March,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp said on Thursday it plans to submit documents on its proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc to U.S. regulators by the end of March, when antitrust and public interest reviews will be launched. The proposed merger between the two biggest U.S. cable service providers is expected to draw intense scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, which reviews whether deals are in the public interest, and either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, which share antitrust oversight. The deal has drawn concern from consumer advocates and some lawmakers who worry that the new company’s size would give it too much power to decide what Americans can watch on TV and do online. Comcast is targeting the end of March to submit its application to the FCC, spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said. Companies usually have 30 business days to file with the FCC after a deal’s announcement. Around the same time, Comcast will also submit documents asking antitrust regulators for approval, she said. The FTC and Justice Department will then determine which agency will take the lead on the review. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and Justice Department antitrust chief William Baer sent a rare public signal of skepticism earlier this month on a potential deal between wireless carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc. No deal has been officially proposed yet between those companies. On Thursday, Wheeler was asked whether he had similar concerns about the proposed tie-up between Comcast and Time Warner Cable. “It was an interesting situation in that Sprint/T-Mobile actually came to us and said: ‘We’re thinking about this, what do you think about it?’ Comcast never did,” Wheeler said. “So I’m in a position right now of sitting and waiting for Comcast to file their requisite documents so that we can begin our consideration. “We’ll wait to give it a full, fair, open hearing,” he added. Comcast, which pledged upfront to several concessions that federal regulators were likely to request, has maintained that customers will benefit from the merger as services and technology improve. “All we can ask for is a full, fair, and open hearing - and I think Chairman Wheeler’s message is that is what we will get,” Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen said on Thursday. “In the broadband space and in the video space, we’re not depriving a single consumer in America of a choice that he or she has today,” Cohen told reporters after the deal was announced last week. The chief executive officer of DirecTV, which competes against Comcast and Time Warner Cable in the pay TV market, on Thursday urged careful regulatory scrutiny of their proposed deal, saying it might create an “effective broadband monopoly” in two-thirds of the United States. Mike White, the DirectTV CEO, said his company, the nation’s largest satellite TV provider, was still determining what position to take with regulators who will review the merger.

491,CMCSA,DirecTV CEO urges U.S. scrutiny of Comcast-TWC broadband reach,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White on Thursday called for U.S. regulatory scrutiny of Comcast Corp’s proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc and the “effective broadband monopoly” he said it might create in as much as two-thirds of the United States. White said his company, the nation’s largest satellite TV provider, was still determining what position to take with Washington regulators who will review the merger. The deal will be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission and either the U.S. Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, the two agencies that share antitrust oversight in the United States. “If the deal is approved as proposed, it clearly represents an unprecedented media concentration in one company,” White told analysts on a conference call after DirecTV reported quarterly results. “One of the challenges is to try and ensure that it is appropriately scrutinized,” he said. Comcast, when it announced the deal on February 13, said it would not reduce competition because the two cable providers do not compete in any markets. Comcast also said the deal would benefit consumers, in part because it would eventually result in higher broadband speeds. Representatives for Comcast could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.

494,CMCSA,"Dish profit rises, chairman criticizes Comcast/TWC deal","(Reuters) - Satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp reported a 38 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit on Friday and the company’s chairman said he saw “nothing good” for competitors if U.S. regulators approve the merger of Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. Dish shares rose 1.6 percent to $57.97 after it reported earnings-per-share of 63 cents, beating the 41-cent consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen said the combination of Comcast and Time Warner Cable would concentrate broadband, video and content in a “nationwide player.” “That’s going to send a seismic shift across our industry in ways that maybe we can’t predict today,” he said on a conference call after the satellite TV provider released its results. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, said on February 13 that it had agreed to acquire No. 4 Time Warner Cable in an all-stock deal for $45.2 billion. The proposal faces reviews from U.S. regulators who will study its effect on competition. Comcast has argued that the combination would not reduce competition because the two cable providers do not compete in any markets. The company pledged to divest 3 million subscribers, so the combined customer base of 30 million would represent just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market. Ergen said the deal, if approved, “certainly doesn’t hurt the case for consolidation” of satellite TV providers. The U.S. government blocked a deal between Dish and DirecTV in 2002. “If you take the No. 1 and 4 providers and put them together, it would be hard to see why you couldn’t put the No. 2 and 3 providers together,” he said. DirectTV is the nation’s second largest pay TV provider after Comcast, and Dish is third. Ergen said the merger would create advantages for the cable operator in negotiations with media companies that supply programming. “When they can combine and go buy content, they can go buy content cheaper than anybody else,” he said. “I see nothing good in that transaction for content owners, broadband providers, or video distribution companies” other than Comcast and NBC, he said. Dish is still reviewing the deal’s impact and will present options to its board, Ergen said. He said it was too early to say if Dish would oppose the merger. A Comcast spokesman had no comment on Ergen’s remarks. Investors have been waiting to learn more about Dish’s strategy for the wireless spectrum the company has spent billions amassing. Asked on Friday if he would consider going after wireless carrier T-Mobile USA to potentially compete against Japanese mobile operator Softbank, which owns rival Sprint Corp, Ergen said it was unlikely. Dish tried to derail Softbank’s plans to buy Sprint last year by bidding for the carrier but ultimately lost. “Certainly we’ve had experience competing against Softbank and (are) realistic to know that we’re not going to outbid Softbank in any transaction,” Ergen said. Ergen said he was “cautiously optimistic” Dish will reach a deal with Walt Disney Co before the company’s next quarterly conference call. The companies have extended a now-expired contract and are negotiating the terms for Dish to carry ESPN and other Disney-onwed networks. For the quarter that ended in December, Dish said its stable of U.S. customers reached about 14.1 million as it added 8,000 pay-TV subscribers. The average revenue generated per subscriber rose 5 percent to $81.24. Dish’s net income for the quarter reached $288 million compared with $209 million a year earlier. Revenue rose about 7 percent to $3.54 billion. ",2212014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-dish-results/dish-profit-rises-chairman-criticizes-comcast-twc-deal-idUSBREA1K0RS20140221

497,CMCSA,"Not a typo, monopsony in spotlight in U.S. cable deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If U.S. antitrust enforcers decide to challenge the proposed $45 billion merger of Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc, it may be because of an idea with a funny-sounding name that has been gaining currency in government offices. The idea is monopsony power, the mirror image of the better-known monopoly power but a concept that is just as old. A monopoly is one seller with many buyers, while a monopsony (pronounced muh-NOP-suh-nee) is one buyer with many sellers. A textbook example is a milk processor that is the only option for dairy farmers to sell to, and that then forces farmers to sell for less. The U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division is all but certain to examine the potential monopsony power, or buying power, that a combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable would have over media companies that provide TV programming, according to lawyers with expertise in antitrust law. The combined company would have a near 30 percent share of the U.S. pay television market, Comcast has said, as well as be a major provider of broadband Internet access. “It’s a potential concern,” said Maurice Stucke, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer who is now a University of Tennessee professor and of counsel at the law firm GeyerGorey. “It’s not as much in the limelight as monopoly, but monopsony has always been part of the antitrust laws,” he said. Monopsony concerns tend to have a lower profile because they may not directly affect consumers. The harm to the market comes if suppliers go out of business, which reduces society’s overall output, or if suppliers have less money to invest in new technology, equipment and expansion. Consumers may even benefit from monopsony if a company cuts its prices, although the savings are not always passed along. In the case of Comcast-Time Warner Cable, it could be argued that a more powerful pay TV operator may be able to lower fees if it can negotiate lower programming costs with the TV studios. “It’s a monopsony problem when it threatens to decrease output. If all it does is reduce cost, it’s a good thing,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, a University of Iowa law professor. He added: “Monopsony is one of those things that is frequently claimed and rarely proven.” Princeton University economist Paul Krugman criticized the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger in a February 15 post on his New York Times blog titled, “Monopsony Begets Monopoly, And Vice Versa.” Comcast “is able to extract far more favorable deals from content providers than smaller rivals,” Krugman wrote. “And if it’s allowed to acquire (Time Warner Cable), it will be even more advantaged.” Others say it is hard to see how a media conglomerate like Walt Disney Co, or even smaller content providers, would feel much pain from slightly lower payments or from one fewer way to distribute shows. “Given the rapidly increasing number of avenues for distributing content, I think that’s far-fetched,” said Jeffrey Eisenach, an economic consultant who has done work for Comcast in the past but is not working on the merger. Asked about the possibility of a monopsony challenge, a spokeswoman for Comcast pointed to a 2009 federal appeals court ruling that said there was “overwhelming evidence” that the communications marketplace was competitive. The ruling threw out a regulation designed to limit market share among companies such as Comcast to 30 percent. “Today there are even more types of video competition than when the court threw out the case,” Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice wrote in an email. She said TV networks can distribute their programs to consumers in many ways, such as DirecTV’s satellite service or Verizon’s FiOS video service. There are also video streaming sites, such as Netflix and Hulu. Antitrust experts said Comcast and Time Warner Cable may be able to address some government concerns by extending the terms of a settlement that Comcast signed with the Justice Department in 2011 to secure approval to buy NBC Universal. For instance, Comcast promised to make programming, such as cable news channel CNBC, available to competing pay-TV companies. Review of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal is expected to take several months. Either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission will examine it for antitrust compliance, while the Federal Communications Commission will rule on whether it is in the public interest. The antitrust standard is whether the deal would substantially lessen competition. If government lawyers believe it would, they could sue in federal court. Sometimes even the threat of a suit is enough to scuttle a deal. Monopsony has been getting more attention within the Justice Department. A senior staff economist, Gregory Werden, wrote a paper in 2007 arguing that the original U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, was designed to protect sellers as well as end-user consumers. In 2010, the department drew attention to monopsony concerns when it released revised guidelines for corporations considering mergers. The guidelines replaced a document from 1997 and included an expanded discussion of monopsony. When suppliers do not have “numerous attractive outlets for their goods or services,” the two agencies “may conclude that the merger of competing buyers is likely to lessen competition in a manner harmful to sellers,” the guidelines said. Wal-Mart Stores Inc has routinely faced criticism that it has monopsony power because of its ability to drive down the prices it pays suppliers. But the retail giant’s defenders say there is little evidence that suppliers are hurt, and Wal-Mart’s low prices for customers also make it popular. Monopsony is most often an issue in agriculture. In 1999, the Justice Department feared that Cargill Inc’s plan to acquire part of Continental Grain Co would concentrate the market for buying corn, soybeans and wheat, and it approved the acquisition only after the global commodities trader agreed to sell off grain elevators. The Justice Department sued in 2008 to block the combination of two of the top four U.S. beef packers, JBS SA and National Beef Packing Co, saying it would have hurt both cattle suppliers and consumers. The companies abandoned the deal four months later. In the context of the pay TV market, a key question is how a channel would fare if it were not carried by a merged Comcast-Time Warner Cable. “If you’re told you can’t reach 30 percent of a potential market, how significant is that for a competitor who wants to produce? That’s a technical question,” said Peter Carstensen, a University of Wisconsin law professor. “You’ve got to put the data together. You’ve got to come up with a plausible story, with witnesses, with the econometrics, to make that case,” he said, “and whether that can be done convincingly, I don’t know.” ",2212014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-comcast-monopsony-analysis/not-a-typo-monopsony-in-spotlight-in-u-s-cable-deal-idUSBREA1K1VI20140221

501,CMCSA,Netflix to pay Comcast for faster speeds,"(Reuters) - Netflix has agreed to pay one of the largest broadband providers in the United States Comcast Corp for faster speeds, throwing open the possibility that more content companies will have to shell out for better service. Comcast and Netflix made the joint announcement on Sunday, marking the first time that Netflix is paying for faster speeds in the U.S. after customers complained about slow service. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The arrangement comes as federal regulators are wrestling with an issue known as “Net neutrality” concerning broadband providers and whether they can slow down traffic to particular websites, potentially forcing content companies to pay for faster Web service. The Federal Communications Commission said last week it plans to rewrite the rules after a U.S. court struck down the commission’s previous version. The issue is being closely watched as millions of people view movies and TV shows through streaming services offered by such companies like Netflix and Amazon. Netflix, which got its start as a DVD-by-mail service, has 44 million subscribers worldwide and 34 million in the U.S. alone. About 7 million subscribers pay for mail delivery services. The companies said in a statement that they have been “working collaboratively over many months” to strike a multi-year agreement. Netflix will not receive preferential network treatment, the companies said. As part of the deal, Netflix will deliver its movies and TV programs to Comcast’s broadband network directly as opposed through third party providers, giving viewers faster streaming speeds for watching movies and TV programs. It also could force Netflix to strike similar arrangements, known in the industry as interconnect agreements, with other major broadband providers like Verizon and AT&T.; With more than 44 million subscribers throughout the world, Netflix has been making an effort to connect directly with broadband Internet providers. It has struck similar deals with Cablevision and Cox, though Netflix did not pay for these connections. The arrangement with Netflix comes on the heels of Comcast’s agreement to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, a deal that will draw the scrutiny of U.S. antitrust enforcers. The combined company would have a near 30 percent share of the U.S. pay television market, as well as be the major provider of broadband Internet access.

507,CMCSA,Consumer class actions get boost from U.S. top court,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Supreme Court gave consumers a victory on Monday by allowing them to proceed with class-action lawsuits alleging that millions of front-loading washing machines they bought suffered from mold or musty odors. By refusing to hear the appeals in three lawsuits, the court allowed claims against Whirlpool Corp, Sears Holdings Corp and a unit of Germany’s BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeraete GmbH to move forward as class actions in lower courts. Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers had urged the Supreme Court to hear the companies’ appeals. The court has in recent years cut back on the ability of plaintiffs to pursue class actions, which can lead to bigger jury awards and settlements than individual lawsuits, in cases against AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. At issue in the washing-machine cases was whether claims about alleged defects in Whirlpool washers, Kenmore-brand washers made for Sears by Whirlpool, and BSH Home Appliance Corp washers were similar enough to be heard at the same time. Consumers said that the machines did not clean themselves properly, while the companies said only a small number of machines had problems. Whirlpool said in a statement that it would keep vigorously defending against the lawsuits, which it called an “attack” on American manufacturing. “The facts remain unchanged: the vast majority of class members have not been harmed and never will be,” it said. Sears said in a statement that it disagreed with the decision and that an “overwhelming majority” of owners of its Kenmore front-loading washers were pleased with them. BSH declined to comment. Samuel Issacharoff, a New York University law professor who represents Sears and Whirlpool consumers, called the court’s decision “a big win,” adding: “There is nothing un-American about manufacturers having to stand behind their products.” The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago had allowed consumers to pursue respective claims as groups against Whirlpool in Ohio, and Sears in six U.S. states. Those courts’ initial rulings for the consumers were later thrown out after the Supreme Court ruled for Comcast last March over cable TV subscribers who accused it of overcharging them. The court said the proposed Comcast class was too diverse. The 6th Circuit and 7th Circuit nonetheless later ruled for the washing-machine plaintiffs a second time. Sears had said the 7th Circuit decision by Judge Richard Posner “opens the door to class actions based on any mass-produced product’s failure to meet expectations of a handful of consumers, no matter how few other buyers had the same problem.” Another appeals court, the 9th Circuit, had refused to let BSH appeal a December 2012 ruling by a federal judge in Santa Ana, California, allowing a class action against that company to go ahead. Whirlpool is based in Benton Harbor, Michigan; Sears in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, and BSH Bosch in Munich. The cases are BSH Home Appliances Corp v. Cobb et al, 13-138; Sears, Roebuck & Co v.

513,CMCSA,"UPDATE 2-Netflix may need to pay AT&T;, Verizon for faster speeds","By Liana B. Baker and Lisa Richwine Feb 24 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc, which agreed to pay Comcast Corp for faster video delivery, may have to make similar arrangements with other broadband providers to ensure customers get trouble-free access to its streaming movies and TV shows. Verizon Communications’ chief executive said on Monday he expects Netflix will pay the telecom company for faster speeds after Netflix customers complained about slow connections to Verizon’s FiOS service. AT&T; spokesman Mark Siegel said in a statement on Monday that “we’re in discussions with Netflix to establish a more direct connection between our networks, similar to agreements we have with others, so that AT&T; broadband customers who use Netflix can enjoy an even better video experience.” Talks with telecom companies that provide broadband Internet access gained momentum after Sunday, when Netflix agreed to pay Comcast Corp for faster speeds. Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould said the agreement with Comcast removed uncertainty and likely involved small payments since Netflix agreed voluntarily to the arrangement. “This is probably a template for the deal that will get done with other broadband providers,” said Gould, who has an “equal weight” rating on Netflix shares. “We are assuming the payments are not going to materially change the business model.” Netflix shares rose 3.4 percent to close at a record $447 on Nasdaq. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said on CNBC, where he discussed Verizon’s talks with Netflix, that the two companies have been in negotiations for a year. These deals hinge on whether Netflix can set up direct access to Verizon, known as an “interconnect agreement,” rather than go through a third party. Verizon provides millions of U.S. customers with its FiOS broadband service and Netflix speeds have slowed on that network in recent months, leading to complaints. Interconnect deals have been common in the broadband industry for years. Comcast has agreements in place with Google Inc and Yahoo Inc, according to a source familiar with the matter. Many providers including Cox, Cablevision and Google Fiber directly connect to the Netflix network through a service the streaming company developed called Open Connect. Those providers have not seen their speeds deteriorate in recent months. But others, including AT&T; and Verizon, have opted not to use Open Connect. Shares of Cogent Communications, one of the companies that took care of the Internet traffic exchange between the Comcast and Netflix networks, fell 7 percent on Monday as investors worried that these deals would take away Cogent’s business. Cogent’s chief executive Dave Schaeffer played down the effect of the Comcast-Netflix agreement on its business and reaffirmed the company’s annual revenue forecast. “It doesn’t mean that revenue goes away from Cogent. It just means that some of the growth in revenue may not occur through us,” he said. McAdam, the Verizon CEO, spoke out in favor of telecom companies signing deals with Netflix. “It shows you don’t necessarily need a lot of regulation in a dynamic market here. Doing these commercial deals will get good investment and good returns for both parties,” McAdam said. Asked about discussions with Verizon or other providers, Netflix spokesman Joris Evers said “we talk to all major ISPs all the time to make sure Netflix users get the best possible experience.”",2252014,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-fios/update-2-netflix-may-need-to-pay-att-verizon-for-faster-speeds-idUSL1N0LT1TK20140225
514,CMCSA,"TiVo beats on sales, sees gains from Comcast-Time Warner deal","(Reuters) - Digital video recorder maker TiVo Inc (TIVO.O) reported a better-than-expected 20 percent rise in quarterly revenue and said it expects to benefit from Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) $45.2 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable TWC.N. The deal will give Comcast, a key cable customer of TiVo, access to 19 of the 20 largest U.S. TV markets and is widely expected to reshape the country’s pay TV and broadband markets. TiVo also said Comcast plans to expand the integration of Xfinity On Demand, the cable company’s digital store of movies and TV shows, on TiVo’s set-top boxes to its entire market. “To the extent (the expansion) continues to apply to the digital markets that Comcast may acquire, we certainly look at that as a potential benefit,” Chief Executive Tom Rogers told Reuters. Cable subscribers are increasingly turning to TiVo’s set-top boxes which also allow them to access online video services such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Hulu and Google Inc’s (GOOG.O) YouTube. Analysts expect Netflix’s recent deal to pay Comcast more for faster broadband speeds to benefit TiVo. The agreement is likely to drive more subscribers to buy Tivo’s set-top boxes as streaming Netflix on Comcast-owned-and-operated boxes have TV and movie rights content conflicts, Albert, Fried & Co analyst Rich Tullo wrote in a pre-earnings note. TiVo’s cable customers also include Virgin Media Inc VMED.O, DirecTV DTV.O, Ono ONOCA.UL, RCN and Suddenlink. Comcast reported last month that it added more video subscribers than expected in the fourth quarter, while DirecTV reported a higher-than-expected rise in U.S. subscribers. TiVo said it added 319,000 net subscribers in the fourth quarter ended January 31, including 313,000 subscribers in its cable and satellite television business, which provides digital video recording service through its own and service providers’ set-top boxes. The company forecast first-quarter profit of $5 million-$8 million and service and technology revenue of $85 million to $87 million. TiVo posted a net profit of $710,000, or 1 cent per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of $15.8 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding an unanticipated non-cash charge of $4.8 million, profit was 2 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $106.3 million from $88.9 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 4 cents per share on revenue of $84.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

515,CMCSA,"UPDATE 1-TiVo beats on sales, sees gains from Comcast-Time Warner deal","By Sruthi Ramakrishnan Feb 26 (Reuters) - Digital video recorder maker TiVo Inc  reported a better-than-expected 20 percent rise in quarterly revenue and said it expects to benefit from Comcast Corp’s $45.2 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable . The deal will give Comcast, a key cable customer of TiVo, access to 19 of the 20 largest U.S. TV markets and is widely expected to reshape the country’s pay TV and broadband markets. TiVo also said Comcast plans to expand the integration of Xfinity On Demand, the cable company’s digital store of movies and TV shows, on TiVo’s set-top boxes to its entire market. “To the extent (the expansion) continues to apply to the digital markets that Comcast may acquire, we certainly look at that as a potential benefit,” Chief Executive Tom Rogers told Reuters. Cable subscribers are increasingly turning to TiVo’s set-top boxes which also allow them to access online video services such as Netflix Inc, Hulu and Google Inc’s YouTube. Analysts expect Netflix’s recent deal to pay Comcast more for faster broadband speeds to benefit TiVo. The agreement is likely to drive more subscribers to buy Tivo’s set-top boxes as streaming Netflix on Comcast-owned-and-operated boxes have TV and movie rights content conflicts, Albert, Fried & Co analyst Rich Tullo wrote in a pre-earnings note. TiVo’s cable customers also include Virgin Media Inc , DirecTV, Ono, RCN and Suddenlink. Comcast reported last month that it added more video subscribers than expected in the fourth quarter, while DirecTV reported a higher-than-expected rise in U.S. subscribers. TiVo said it added 319,000 net subscribers in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, including 313,000 subscribers in its cable and satellite television business, which provides digital video recording service through its own and service providers’ set-top boxes. The company forecast first-quarter profit of $5 million-$8 million and service and technology revenue of $85 million to $87 million. TiVo posted a net profit of $710,000, or 1 cent per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of $15.8 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding an unanticipated non-cash charge of $4.8 million, profit was 2 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $106.3 million from $88.9 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 4 cents per share on revenue of $84.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

516,CMCSA,Comcast would consider a spinoff of subscribers: source,"(Reuters) - Comcast is considering spinning off the 3 million subscribers it has offered to divest as part of its proposed $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable, into a publicly traded company, according to sources familiar with the matter. The sources, who did not want to be named because the plans are private, said that Comcast had not yet made a decision and this is just one option it is considering. Comcast has said it is willing to divest 3 million subscribers to reduce U.S. regulators’ competitive concerns. Comcast has said it plans to submit documents on its proposed Time Warner Cable acquisition to U.S. regulators by the end of March, when antitrust and public interest reviews will be launched. The deal has drawn concern from consumer advocates and some lawmakers who worry that the new company’s size would give it too much power to decide what Americans can watch on TV and do online. Comcast may sell the cable systems - whose location has yet to be determined - to a strategic buyer but a spinoff may be more tax efficient to shareholders of the combined company, the person added. Bloomberg first reported the news of the potential spinoff on Friday. The sources told Reuters that a spinoff was only one of several possibilities for the subscribers it needs to divest as part of the deal, which a second source said have already attracted interest from potential buyers. It is not even clear whether the final number of subscribers to be divested will be the same as the three million initially mentioned, the second source said. Liberty Media Chief Executive Greg Maffei said on Friday that Charter Communications would consider buying the subscribers Comcast is looking to divest. Liberty Media owns 27 percent of Charter.

518,CMCSA,Liberty says Charter would look at buying Comcast divestitures,"(Reuters) - Charter Communications would consider buying subscribers that Comcast could divest as part of its proposed Time Warner Cable takeover, Greg Maffei, chief executive of Charter’s largest stakeholder, Liberty Media, said on Friday. These were Liberty Media’s first comments since Charter Communications (CHTR.O), in which it has a 27 stake, lost out on acquiring Time Warner Cable TWC.N to Comcast. Although Comcast, the top U.S. cable operator, had always been intrigued by the idea of buying Time Warner Cable, a deal was not on its list of priorities until Charter put it in play last summer. Maffei told a conference call that Charter could still go after Time Warner Cable if regulators reject the Comcast deal, although he expects it to win approval, though perhaps with “onerous conditions.” Maffei said he thinks the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal will ultimately be approved by regulators but said if the deal were to fall through, Liberty and Charter Communications (CHTR.O) are leaving the option on the table of acquiring Time Warner Cable. Maffei said he wants Liberty and Charter to be “flexible both for acquisitions of other systems or potentially the divestitures out of Time Warner or if the Time Warner deal is not able to be completed — looking back at the whole thing,” he said. Comcast has said it is willing to divest 3 million subscribers. While Charter, driven by Liberty Media, missed out on acquiring Time Warner Cable, Maffei did not rule out further cable deals. “We certainly learned in this process that there were many investors who are interested in investing in cable consolidation either with Charter or alongside Liberty. And I suspect if a need arises for additional equity for a cable consolidation play, we’ll see a lot of interest,” he said. Liberty last month offered to buy out Sirius XM’s minority shareholders in a deal that could be worth more than $10 billion. The deal would make the entire asset part of Liberty’s portfolio and take the public shares off the market. Liberty currently owns more than half of Sirius XM. Shareholders such as consumer advocate Ralph Nader have spoken out against the deal, an offer of $3.68 per share that provides little premium to shareholders. Sirius XM shares were trading at $3.62 per share on Friday. Liberty said it still wants to go through with the deal and use Sirius XM’s cash for share repurchase or strategic acquisitions. Maffei said Liberty was in touch with Sirius XM’s special committee, which is studying the offer. While he suggested there could be a bit of room for Sirius XM’s committee to negotiate a higher price, he said that a deal does not have to get done and in terms of price, “there certainly are limits to what would be appealing.” Maxim Securities analyst John Tinker said that Maffei is in full negotiating mode and “is very clear that at a certain price they don’t need to do the deal.” ",2282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-liberty-charter/liberty-says-charter-would-look-at-buying-comcast-divestitures-idUSBREA1R1KR20140228

521,CMCSA,U.S. Sen. Franken sees higher prices if Comcast buys Time Warner Cable,"WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Al Franken warned telecommunications regulators on Thursday that Comcast Corp’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc  could mean “higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service for consumers.” Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, said on Feb. 13 it had agreed to acquire No. 4 Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion. The proposal faces reviews from U.S. regulators who will study its effect on competition. In a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, said Comcast had failed to live up to a long list of promises made when its 2011 agreement to acquire NBC Universal won U.S. approval. Comcast responded that it was “proud of our track-record on complying with the conditions from our past transactions.” “We’ve gone above and beyond in compliance with most conditions, including our low-income broadband program, the amount of local news programming and investment in local stations, the amount of on-demand programming, especially children’s programming,” said spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice. Franken complained that Comcast had interfered in 2007 with BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer network that Comcast viewed as a competitor to its cable offerings. The FCC subsequently passed rules requiring all data be treated equally by Internet providers, although those rules were struck down by a federal appeals court. Comcast agreed, however, in 2011 to net neutrality provisions to win approval for the NBC Universal deal. Net neutrality requires that all data be treated equally by Internet providers. Still, Franken said, “The underlying merits of the dispute and the conduct at issue remain relevant to the FCC’s consideration of Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable.” Franken also cited a study by the Free Press consumer advocacy group, which found Comcast had failed to live up to promises to increase local news and programming. “The FCC should scrutinize whether these allegations have merit,” Franken wrote. He also questioned whether Comcast had lived up to promises to provide reasonably priced broadband to customers who did not take cable. Franken noted that the advocacy group Public Knowledge, had petitioned the FCC in 2012 to look into Comcast’s use of data caps for some users. “The FCC should examine this issue in connection with Comcast’s proposed acquisition,” he wrote. A source close to Comcast said on Thursday the company had no data caps, which limit Internet use, outside of a few test areas. The source was not authorized to speak on the record and requested anonymity. In an early 2013 report that Comcast did on its merger with NBC Universal, the company said it had introduced three independent networks, was investing in news and children’s programming and had donated broadband access to schools, libraries and areas with many low-income residents. Comcast has argued that the combination would not reduce competition because the two cable providers do not compete in any markets. The company pledged to divest 3 million subscribers, so the combined customer base of 30 million would represent just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market. An FCC spokesman declined to say whether the agency was looking any of the allegations made by Franken.",2282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/timewarnercable-comcast-franken/u-s-sen-franken-sees-higher-prices-if-comcast-buys-time-warner-cable-idUSL1N0LW2Z320140228
522,CMCSA,Fake emergency alert in movie ad draws fines for U.S. media firms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. advertisement for a movie that sounded like an emergency alert has drawn fines of $1.9 million for media companies Viacom Inc and Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal and ESPN, co-controlled by Walt Disney Co. after viewer complaints. The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it found the three companies “apparently willfully and repeatedly violated” the rules that prohibit the use of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) sounds for purposes other than to warn viewers of national emergencies. Several consumers had complained about the trailer for the movie “The Olympus Has Fallen” shown on the television channels Comedy Central, ESPN and SyFy in March of 2013. The FCC review confirmed that the 30-second ad for the movie used portions of EAS codes and alert signals, accompanied by text “this is not a test” and “this is not a drill,” which caused “the transmission of false distress signals.” Viacom now faces $1.1 million in penalties for airing the ad 108 times on seven of its channels; NBCUniversal faces a charge of $530,000 for showing the trailer 38 times on seven of its cable networks; and ESPN faces a penalty of $280,000 for showing the promo 13 times on three of its networks. During the investigation, Viacom and NBCUniversal had argued they were not liable for the promos and were not subject to the FCC’s rules on EAS signals as they were not participants in the EAS program. The regulators disagreed. The EAS is a national public warning system that ensures the U.S. president could address all Americans during a national emergency and allows federal, state, and local authorities to deliver emergency information, such as Amber Alerts about missing children or tornado warnings. The FCC has been going after EAS violators following what it says has been a recent spike in consumer complaints. In November, the agency proposed a similar $25,000 fine to Turner Broadcasting, a cable unit of Time Warner Inc, for a promo for the Conan O’Brien comedy show on TBS.

526,CMCSA,Comcast expands low-income Internet service as merger review nears,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp on Tuesday said its discounted Internet service for low-income families will be available indefinitely, a move that should please U.S. regulators as the company seeks approval for its $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable. Internet Essentials is Comcast’s broadband Internet program for some low-income families with children. It costs $9.95 a month and offers a discount with other perks. The program has enrolled about 300,000 families since it launched in 2011. Some 2.6 million U.S. families are eligible, according to Comcast. It was originally expected to run through the end of the 2013-2014 school year. As part of Comcast’s proposed merger, the offer will be available in 19 of 20 largest U.S. cities as Comcast expands into Time Warner Cable’s markets, Comcast executives said, calling Internet Essentials the largest broadband adoption program by both geography and subscribers. “I don’t think there’s a broadband adoption program in the country, private or government, that has the reach or has had the impact of Internet Essentials,” said Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen. The program has become one way Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, is fulfilling a promise of broader deployment and adoption of broadband it made to federal regulators to gain approval for its NBC Universal merger in 2011. It could become a bargaining chip as Comcast seeks federal approval of its $45.2 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc. The U.S. Justice Department, which reviews antitrust concerns, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which studies whether deals are in the public interest, have yet to review the proposed merger. “I think the FCC’s going to find that to be a very appealing public-interest benefit,” Cohen told reporters on February 13, after the companies announced merger plans. Cohen said on Tuesday that in discussing the merger at upcoming meetings in Washington, he planned to emphasize, among other issues, the expansion of Comcast’s commitments, such as to low-income broadband, children’s programming and local news, to Time Warner Cable’s markets. Since its launch, Comcast has expanded the program to serve not only families with children who qualify for free or cheaper school lunches, but also homeschoolers and those studying at parochial, private and cyber schools. Only families who had not been Comcast customers within 90 days of applying can qualify for the program. Public-interest advocates and some lawmakers have started sounding concerns that Comcast has not fully complied with the promises it made in 2011, including those aimed at improving the services for low-income customers. Comcast rejected those claims and said in an annual report last week that it delivered, and in some cases over-delivered, on those promises. The FCC and the Justice Department were expected to launch their reviews of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal at the end of the month, after Comcast submits required documents. The reviews were likely to take months to complete. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee planned to hold a hearing on the merger on March 26.

527,CMCSA,Verizon in talks with content providers for online video service,"NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications  is in talks with content providers to deliver web-based TV services to mobile platforms, chief executive Lowell McAdam, said at an investor conference on Tuesday. A day earlier, Dish Network Corp and Walt Disney Co  announced a landmark deal that will allow the No. 2 satellite TV provider to deliver Disney-owned network content online, outside of a traditional TV subscription. Verizon’s goal “is to work with the content providers,” said  McAdam at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference. “I have personally had discussions with the CEOs of the large content companies, and we would love to partner with them to see how we can take FiOS contact mobilely across the country.” he said. McAdam said the company could also look at providing a service delivered over wireless airwaves and not just broadband. According to PwC’s annual entertainment and media forecast, North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on entertainment from services such as Netflix that are offered over the top, meaning they are utilized over a network but not offered by the network operator. “I think you can actually get a virtuous cycle where broadcast viewing goes up and over-the-top viewing goes up, if you time this properly,” McAdam said. In January, Verizon acquired Intel Corp’s OnCue service for an undisclosed sum to accelerate its push into next-generation video services, including integrating it with Verizon’s FiOS fiber-based Internet and TV service that has more than 5 million video subscribers, about 5 percent of pay TV households. The company said it was open to providing over-the-top content to any device. McAdam also stressed that Verizon expects Netflix to pay for faster video delivery as part of a so-called interconnect deal,  in an arrangement similar to the one the video provider has made with Comcast Corp. “I have spoken live and via email with (Netflix CEO) Reed Hastings, and I believe that we will get some sort of an arrangement with them as well,” said McAdam.",3042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-onlinetv/verizon-in-talks-with-content-providers-for-online-video-service-idUSL1N0M11PV20140304

As part of Comcast’s proposed merger, the offer will be available in 19 of 20 largest U.S. cities as Comcast expands into Time Warner Cable’s markets, Comcast executives said, calling Internet Essentials the largest broadband adoption program by both geography and subscribers. “I don’t think there’s a broadband adoption program in the country, private or government, that has the reach or has had the impact of Internet Essentials,” said Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen. The program has become one way Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, is fulfilling a promise of broader deployment and adoption of broadband it made to federal regulators to gain approval for its NBC Universal merger in 2011. It could become a bargaining chip as Comcast seeks federal approval of its $45.2 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc. The U.S. Justice Department, which reviews antitrust concerns, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which studies whether deals are in the public interest, have yet to review the proposed merger. “I think the FCC’s going to find that to be a very appealing public-interest benefit,” Cohen told reporters on February 13, after the companies announced merger plans. Cohen said on Tuesday that in discussing the merger at upcoming meetings in Washington, he planned to emphasize, among other issues, the expansion of Comcast’s commitments, such as to low-income broadband, children’s programming and local news, to Time Warner Cable’s markets. Since its launch, Comcast has expanded the program to serve not only families with children who qualify for free or cheaper school lunches, but also homeschoolers and those studying at parochial, private and cyber schools. Only families who had not been Comcast customers within 90 days of applying can qualify for the program. Public-interest advocates and some lawmakers have started sounding concerns that Comcast has not fully complied with the promises it made in 2011, including those aimed at improving the services for low-income customers. Comcast rejected those claims and said in an annual report last week that it delivered, and in some cases over-delivered, on those promises. The FCC and the Justice Department were expected to launch their reviews of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal at the end of the month, after Comcast submits required documents. The reviews were likely to take months to complete. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee planned to hold a hearing on the merger on March 26.",3042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-comcast-internet/comcast-expands-low-income-internet-service-as-merger-review-nears-idUSL1N0M111820140304
529,CMCSA,"U.S. antitrust chief recused on Comcast, Time Warner Cable review","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. antitrust enforcer, Bill Baer, will be recused from reviewing Comcast Corp’s proposed deal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. The investigation of the $45.2 billion deal will be overseen by two other Justice Department officials: Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Renata Hesse and Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Gelfand, a litigator. In a statement announcing the decision, the Justice Department did not say why Baer, who heads the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, had recused himself. When Comcast was buying NBC Universal, a deal concluded in early 2011, Baer, then a partner at the law firm of Arnold & Porter, represented NBCU’s owner, General Electric. Hesse has significant experience with big mergers. While at the FCC, she headed the team that reviewed AT&T;’s proposed merger to buy T-Mobile USA. The U.S. government challenged that deal in 2011, and the companies eventually gave up. The Comcast will also be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission. Consumer advocates have criticized the proposed transaction since a combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable would have a near 30 percent share of the U.S. pay television market and would be a major provider of broadband Internet access. As the U.S. agencies prepare to review the deal, Comcast has been working to burnish its reputation with regulators. On Tuesday, it announced that its discounted Internet service for low-income families, Internet Essentials, will be available indefinitely.

534,CMCSA,Media executives question Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal,"(Reuters) - One of the top executives of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has raised questions about Comcast’s potential dominance of the U.S. broadband Internet market if regulators allow its $45.2 billion merger with Time Warner Cable to be completed. Speaking at an investor conference on Tuesday, Chase Carey, Fox president and chief operating officer, said the “broadband issue” will be front and center when U.S. regulators review the tie-up that merges the No. 1 and No. 2 cable operators. Asked about concerns over the merger, Carey said, “Probably the issue that will come out of it, and that will ultimately get focused on, is really the broadband issue. Is there choice in broadband? Are you really headed toward every home having simply one broadband provider, and what are the implications of that?” If its bid for Time Warner Cable is approved, Comcast would be the Internet provider to about 40 percent of U.S. households paying for high-speed Internet access, analysts estimate. As TV service becomes more personalized with new navigation tools and targeted advertising, broadband infrastructure, and who controls that service, will become even more critical, Carey said. There has not been any pushback so far from companies against the deal, he added. “We haven’t seen any filings yet and how does that get addressed? I assume there will be aspects of that that are addressed,” he said. “Potentially, you may have for most of the country, simply one wired broadband pipe and again that’s the piece that will get, at the end of the day, most focused on,” he said. Comcast did not respond to a request for comment. Also at the same conference, Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes predicted a government role in bolstering post-merger competition. “In the longer run there are some questions on competition that any deal like this will look at, the government will look at and make sure the appropriate conditions are in place to optimize competition,” Bewkes said. DirecTV’s CEO Mike White, who was already called for regulatory scrutiny of the deal, said on Tuesday, that the government will likely focus on “all the aspects of Internet, from net neutrality to you name it.” He also said the government should consider whether Comcast is a national business instead of a local one which “requires the government to take a different perspective.” Once Comcast files its merger documents with regulators, the Justice Department and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission will both take months to review the merger’s impact on competition, focusing on antitrust and public interest concerns respectively.

536,CMCSA,SoftBank CEO says Sprint could shake up U.S. 'oligopoly',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of Japan’s SoftBank Corp on Tuesday called the U.S. wireless market an oligopoly plagued by slow speeds and high prices and said his company’s Sprint Corp could shake up the competition, but it would require a scale that Sprint cannot reach alone. Masayoshi Son, the billionaire chief of SoftBank, in his first public speech to a U.S. audience since his company gained control of Sprint last year, lambasted the U.S. wireless market as offering “pseudo-competition.” Son did not directly speak about his efforts to engineer a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile US Inc, the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers, but told reporters he hoped to meet again sometime with U.S. regulators, who so far have given a cold shoulder to such a deal. He made a pitch for Sprint to not only challenge its traditional wireless competitors — No. 1 player Verizon Communications Inc and No. 2 AT&T; Inc — but also wireline Internet providers such as Comcast Corp. “I brought the network war and price war (to Japan). I’d like to bring that to the States,” Son told an audience of industry officials at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “I would like to provide an alternative to the oligopolistic situation that two-thirds of American households can only get access to one or two providers. I’d like to be a third alternative with 10 times the speed and lower price.” Son said Sprint has the same type of radio frequencies that helped SoftBank compete in Japan and SoftBank has technologies that could boost speeds and lower prices, but his companies needed more towers and other support to properly challenge the biggest Internet providers. “We have the spectrum. We have the technology. But we need scale, efficiency to make an investment for the network,” Son told reporters after his speech. “We are already free cash-flow negative. So we can start a small fight but it does not scale, it does not last, it’s not sustainable. We need to have a real fight, a long and deep and heavy fight. And for that, we need scale.” Both the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Tom Wheeler, and U.S. antitrust chief William Baer expressed skepticism about a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile after Son’s round of meetings in Washington in February. SoftBank is now focused on convincing the parties involved with the merits of a merger, a senior company executive said, adding that any moves toward pursuing a deal were now on hold. The official declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the matter publicly. Son, who once threatened to set himself on fire as he pushed Japanese regulators to let him set up a high-speed Internet service, has shown he does not give up easily. He said he wasn’t planning on new meetings with U.S. regulators during this trip, “but whenever we have the opportunity sometime in the future, that is I think necessary.” Son has repeatedly expressed his desire to make SoftBank the biggest mobile-related corporation in the world, and in the past has harshly criticized U.S. mobile networks and the degree of competition in the industry. The potential for the deal and Son’s criticisms have given an edge to the dynamic among top wireless executives. “If Mr. Son is having a bad experience with US wireless, it must be because he’s using Sprint,” Jim Cicconi, AT&T;’s senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, said jokingly in an emailed statement.

Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the committee, said the panel would meet on April 2 to discuss plans by Comcast, the No. 1 U.S. cable operator, to buy TWC for $45.2 billion. TWC is the No. 2 U.S. cable operator. Both companies are major broadband Internet providers. On March 26, the panel will discuss the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act, known as STELA, which expires at the end of 2014 and tackles, among other issues, the retransmission of broadcasting content by satellite companies. Congress must reauthorize the measure. The planned Comcast merger with Time Warner Cable has raised eyebrows even though the companies directly compete against each other in very few markets. “Millions of Americans rely on cable connectivity to receive the programs they love and to access the Internet at the fast speed needed as we conduct more of our lives online,” Leahy said in a statement. “The pending merger is an important opportunity to examine how Americans access these valuable services.” Critics of the deal say it could give one company too much power over what Americans see online and watch on television.

543,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-SoftBank CEO says Sprint could shake up U.S. 'oligopoly',"By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Japan’s SoftBank Corp on Tuesday called the U.S. wireless market an oligopoly plagued by slow speeds and high prices and said his company’s Sprint Corp could shake up the competition, but it would require a scale that Sprint cannot reach alone. Masayoshi Son, the billionaire CEO of SoftBank, in his first public speech to a U.S. audience since his company gained control of Sprint last year, lambasted the U.S. wireless market as offering “pseudo-competition.” Son did not directly speak about his efforts to engineer a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile US Inc, the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers, but told reporters he hoped to meet again sometime with U.S. regulators, who so far have given a cold shoulder to such a deal. He made a pitch for Sprint to not only challenge its traditional wireless competitors - No. 1 player Verizon Communications Inc and No. 2 AT&T; Inc - but also wireline Internet providers such as Comcast Corp. “I brought the network war and price war (to Japan). I’d like to bring that to the States,” Son told an audience of industry officials at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “I would like to provide an alternative to the oligopolistic situation that two-thirds of American households can only get access to one or two providers. I’d like to be a third alternative with 10 times the speed and lower price.” Son said Sprint has the same type of radio frequencies that helped SoftBank compete in Japan and SoftBank has technologies that could boost speeds and lower prices, but his companies needed more towers and other support to properly challenge the biggest Internet providers. “We have the spectrum. We have the technology. But we need scale, efficiency to make an investment for the network,” Son told reporters after his speech. “We are already free cash-flow negative. So we can start a small fight but it does not scale, it does not last, it’s not sustainable. We need to have a real fight, a long and deep and heavy fight. And for that, we need scale.” Both the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Tom Wheeler, and U.S. antitrust chief William Baer expressed skepticism about a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile after Son’s round of meetings in Washington in February. SoftBank is now focused on convincing the parties involved with the merits of a merger, a senior company executive said, adding that any moves toward pursuing a deal were now on hold.

544,CMCSA,Comcast deal may offer media companies leverage on fees,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Media companies plan to press Comcast Corp for higher fees in the coming year, seeing an opportunity to squeeze better terms from the U.S. cable company as regulators review its planned takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc. Comcast and Time Warner Cable paid nearly $14 billion to content companies last year for rights to distribute their films, television shows and sporting events. Broadcasters and cable television networks have “assignment clauses” in their contracts with Time Warner Cable that require the networks to sign off before Comcast can merge the two cable operators’ agreements, according to people who have negotiated agreements in the past. Media executives say most programmers will push for higher rates in return for expanding their deals to cover digital distribution of their content. They declined to give specifics, citing confidential contracts. “Media companies selling programming can be expected to leverage the policy and politics surrounding the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger to extract sizeable and unusual concessions,” said Jimmy Schaeffler, chairman of pay TV consultant firm The Carmel Group. Comcast is expected in March to formally request a Federal Communications Commission review of the $45.2 billion Time Warner Cable deal. The combined company will control almost 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market and about a third of the high-speed Internet market. While content providers are broadly concerned about the long-term negotiating clout of the new company, many of them are looking for immediate ways to benefit from the merger, according to media executives who requested anonymity because their negotiations with Comcast will be private. Media companies see increased value for their content following a recent deal by satellite operator Dish Network Corp to pay Walt Disney Co for the rights to stream ESPN, ABC and other programs over the Internet. Analysts say Disney likely pocketed higher subscriber fees from Dish for channels such as ESPN and Disney Channel. In 2013, ESPN was paid an industry average fee of $5.54 per subscriber per month while Disney Channel received $1.15 per subscriber per month, according to SNL Kagan. CBS Corp CEO Leslie Moonves hinted at an investor conference this week that he would push for better terms from Comcast. “There’s going to be a lot of discussions going on about how you get those two contracts together,” he said, referring to the melding of Comcast and Time Warner Cable’s licensing agreements. “There are certain things that we want to stay out of that deal and there are certain things probably that Comcast doesn’t want,” Moonves said. Comcast currently pays the industry’s lowest rates because of its size. Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus has dismissed the notion that the merged company will bully programmers. “I just find that whole line of concern to be totally ironic,” Marcus said on Wednesday, “given the experience that we have all had over the last dozen years or so where programming costs have risen at a level that far exceeds the price that customers will actually bear.” Time Warner Cable’s programming costs have increased in the last five years by 42 percent, from $23.60 a subscriber in 2008 to $33.62 a subscriber in 2013, according to financial filings. Its overall programming costs will increase to $5.2 billion in 2014, an 8.3 bump percent from 2013. Some programmers are looking at adding digital rights to their contracts with Comcast to push for better terms. The model is Disney’s long-term deal with Comcast in 2012 that included added payments for WatchESPN and WatchDisneyChannel apps and other digital content. Since then, Disney announced a video streaming agreement with Dish and is negotiating a similar one with DirecTV, under which the satellite provider would pay more for the rights to use ESPN, the Disney Channel and content from its ABC stations in an Internet-delivered video service. Media executives say most of their contracts are outdated and they see an opening as Comcast and other cable operators beef up their digital and on-demand offerings to compete against the likes of Netflix Inc. CBS signed a 10-year agreement with Comcast in 2010, that “greatly expanded on-demand access” to its CBS and Showtime programming, according to a press release at the time. But that deal does not give Comcast the ability to stream video online or to offer video outside the home, and limits the amount of video on demand, said a person with knowledge of the arrangement. A spokesman for CBS declined to comment. A Comcast spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Analysts say Comcast could eventually institute “usage based pricing” to charge its subscribers for the broadband they use. Content owners want to make sure they are not left out of such arrangements, which they fear could put their own direct-to-consumer apps at a disadvantage. “If I was a media company, I’d be down there with Comcast every few days asking for what I want,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson Research. “It’s time to haggle.” ",3132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-timewarnercable-content/comcast-deal-may-offer-media-companies-leverage-on-fees-idUSBREA2C2CV20140313

547,CMCSA,Exclusive: States to probe Comcast plan to buy Time Warner Cable,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Florida and other U.S. states will join the Justice Department in seeking to determine if Comcast’s plan to merge with Time Warner Cable is legal under U.S. antitrust law, Florida officials told Reuters. Comcast shares slipped just over 1 percent, trading at $49.68 slightly before midday. “We are part of a multistate group reviewing the proposed transaction along with the U.S. DOJ Antitrust Division,” the Florida attorney general’s office said in an email sent late on Tuesday. It was not known how many states had joined the task force. Indiana officials were also looking at the deal to determine “the potential impact in Indiana.” Erin Reece, a spokeswoman for the Indiana attorney general’s office, did not say whether Indiana was part of the multistate group. Pennsylvania, where Comcast is headquartered, was “reviewing the case independently,” said Joe Peters, a spokesman for the s state’s attorney general’s office. The attorneys general group is focused on broadband rather than cable in assessing the $45.2 billion deal, according to a source familiar with the effort who was not authorized to speak on the record. Comcast had no comment on the states’ review of its proposed deal. Comcast has argued the combination would not reduce competition because the two cable providers do not compete in any markets. The company pledged to divest 3 million subscribers, so the combined customer base of 30 million would represent just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market. A combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable would also have roughly one-third share of the high-speed Internet market. Comcast, which is the No. 1 U.S. cable provider, said on February 13 it had agreed to acquire No. 4 Time Warner Cable. Shares of Time Warner Cable were down 0.4 percent at $135.98 near midday. The deal generated criticism from some lawmakers and consumer groups concerned that there were already too few options for Americans signing up for broadband or cable service. Content providers, the producers of television shows and movies, also worry that a merger of the two cable giants will mean too few buyers for their products, and that those buyers will be able to push their fees down. Comcast, which owns large amounts of content after its 2011 merger with NBC Universal, and Time Warner Cable paid nearly $14 billion to content companies last year for the rights to show their films, television shows and sporting events. The involvement of states typically gives the Justice Department additional resources - and sometimes creates additional pressure - to ensure that a proposed transaction complies with antitrust law. The Federal Communications Commission must also approve the deal before it can close.

549,CMCSA,Time Warner Cable CEO to get $80 million in golden parachute,"(Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Rob Marcus stands to make about $80 million if Comcast’s deal to buy Time Warner Cable closes, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday. Marcus will receive about $20 million in cash, a $2.5 million bonus if certain targets are hit and $56.5 million in equity. Comcast Corp has agreed to buy the No. 2 cable provider in the United States for $45 billion. While striking for a CEO who has been in the top job for barely three months, his “golden parachute” is nothing new in the rough and tumble of big corporations, where well timed deals or even firings often bring big payouts for the executives involved. H.J. Heinz CEO William Johnson, for example, was set to reap about $56 million in last March after the ketchup maker’s acquisition by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. In another instance, Nokia CEO Stephen Elop received an 18.8 million euro ($25.5 million) termination payment after he negotiated the sale of its handset business to Microsoft Corp. Their defenders point to such packages as needed to provide financial security to executives so they would be open to a deal without being worried about being out of a job. Also as part of the Comcast deal, Time Warner CFO Arthur Minson will get a severance package of about $27 million. Marcus took over the chief executive position of Time Warner Cable on January 1 from longtime head Glenn Britt, who retired at the end of last year as an intense jockeying to buy the company started to play out. Britt does not receive a golden parachute in the deal. Charter Communications, a smaller cable rival backed by John Malone, launched an aggressive bid to buy the company for about $37 billion before Comcast swooped in with a sweeter deal.

The discussions are in early stages and there are a lot of hurdles to be crossed before a definitive agreement could be reached, the Journal said. (link.reuters.com/reb87v) Apple, which wants its TV service’s traffic to be separated from public internet traffic over the “last mile” for faster transmission, is looking for special treatment from Comcast’s cables to bypass congestion, the report said. Comcast and Apple declined to comment on the report. Apple has been in talks for a faster TV set-top box with Time Warner Cable Inc, which recently agreed to be bought by Comcast. Apple’s $99 TV box competes with similar streaming devices from Roku and Google Inc. Netflix agreed last month to pay Comcast Corp for faster speeds, throwing open the possibility that more content companies will have to shell out for better service. The Federal Communications Commission is in the process of drafting a new “net-neutrality” bill that would ensure that network operators disclose exactly how they manage Internet traffic and that they do not restrict consumers’ ability to surf the Web or use applications.

553,CMCSA,Tech leads Wall Street lower as Ukraine casts a shadow,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Monday, with some of the market’s recent best performers like technology and biotech shares leading the way down. Concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate gave investors a reason to drop some of the market’s biggest trading favorites. The Nasdaq fell below its 50-day moving average earlier, in a sign of weakening near-term momentum. Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) tumbled 6.7 percent to close at $378.90, with fellow Internet names Facebook Inc (FB.O) down 4.7 percent at $64.10 and TripAdvisor Inc (TRIP.O) down 3.9 percent at $97.58. All three had scored sharp gains in 2013. The Nasdaq biotechnology index .NBI, which jumped 66 percent last year, fell 3 percent in its fourth straight daily decline. Over those four sessions, the biotech index slid 9 percent. On Friday, the index marked its worst day since October 2011. “Biotech stocks have gone parabolic over the past few months, so this is a necessary correction to that,” said Mark D’Cruz, senior investment analyst at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio. “A lot of that interest came from outside traditional biotech investors, who are now being scared off ... Biotechs really have to prove themselves this year, prove that their drugs can deliver.” Ukraine announced the evacuation of its troops from Crimea, essentially yielding the region to Russian forces, which seized a Ukrainian marine base. While few U.S. companies have excessive exposure to the region, investors are concerned about the potential economic fallout from any escalation in tensions. U.S. President Barack Obama, who has imposed personal sanctions against some of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s political and business allies, began crisis talks with his European allies over how to respond in the biggest East-West conflict since the Cold War. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 26.08 points or 0.16 percent, to end at 16,276.69. The S&P; 500 .SPX dropped 9.08 points or 0.49 percent, to finish at 1,857.44. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC slid 50.403 points or 1.18 percent, to close at 4,226.385. “The S&P; 500 is having a difficult time moving past its existing highs around 1,880. While the level represents a stunning rally of approximately 180 percent from the bottom set in March 2009, investors should be aware of the resistance the market is currently facing,” said Dan McElwee, executive vice president of Ventura Wealth Management in Ewing, New Jersey. On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners beat advancers by 1,924 to 1,142. On the Nasdaq, 1,960 stocks fell and 673 shares rose.

The Nasdaq’s losses took it below its 50-day moving average, a sign of weakening near-term momentum, and almost 80 percent of issues traded on the exchange were lower.

563,CMCSA,"Americans take dim view of Comcast, Time Warner Cable deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A majority of Americans are skeptical about the proposed merger of Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N, and they are not convinced the U.S. government is doing enough to prevent monopolies generally, according to a Reuters/Ipsos online poll released on Wednesday. The poll found that 52 percent of those surveyed believed that mergers such as the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal result in less competition and are bad for consumers, while 22 percent believe they allow cable and internet providers to be more efficient and provide better service to consumers. The two rivals said last month they were planning a $45 billion combination that would have just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market and a similar share of the high-speed Internet market. The deal is expected to draw close scrutiny from antitrust enforcers and communications regulators, as well as from members of the U.S. Congress. “These types of mergers give people pause. They make them a little bit nervous about how it will affect them as consumers,” Ipsos pollster Julia Clark said. The sentiment surrounding another recent U.S. merger, the tie-up of American Airlines (AAL.O) and US Airways into the world’s biggest airline, was not quite as cold. The poll found that 42 percent believed it was bad for consumers, while 29 percent felt the opposite way. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online from Thursday to Monday. Its results were based on answers from 1,368 Americans. The data were weighted to the U.S. population by factors such as gender and age. The poll is precise to plus or minus 3 percentage points, based on a measure of accuracy that statisticians call a credibility interval. Skepticism of the mergers varied significantly based on education level, according to the poll. For Comcast-Time Warner Cable, 62 percent of people with a college degree or more took a negative view of the deal, but that number fell to 57 percent among people with some college experience and 42 percent among those with none. The two companies defended their merger, saying it would not remove a competitor from any market because they do not currently overlap. “In fact, the scale of our combined company will help us to innovate even faster and accelerate the deployment of services such as increased broadband speeds and expanded TV options,” Time Warner Cable said in a statement to Reuters. Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said in a separate statement that the transaction would bring consumers benefits such as faster Internet speeds, better programming choices and lower costs, “all things that we think consumers will like.” The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on the cable merger for April 9. American Airlines said in a statement: “We are taking the best of both US Airways and American Airlines to create a formidable competitor with an expanded network that provides a real choice for global and domestic travel.” The poll found a significant share of people who did not state a strong opinion about the mergers. For the cable deal, 26 percent said they did not know how they felt, while for the airline deal, 28 percent said they did not know. Clark said those numbers were above average for a poll about public affairs. “People are acknowledging that this isn’t something that they have enough knowledge about to have a strong opinion,” she said. Although mergers receive significant media attention, antitrust enforcement has not regularly been in the U.S. headlines since a long-running government battle with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) beginning in the 1990s. U.S. mergers and acquisitions above a certain size must be submitted for review to antitrust enforcers, who may seek to block a deal if they believe it would be anticompetitive. The enforcers at the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) try to promote competition in other ways, including criminal investigations into cartel price-fixing or civil inquiries into alleged collusion. Asked in the poll to evaluate how the federal government was doing preventing monopolies and ensuring competition, 30 percent said they approved and 42 percent said they disapproved. Twenty-eight percent said they did not know. The answers revealed a significant partisan split, as Democrats approved of the government’s job by a 45-33 margin and Republicans disapproved by a 56-23 margin. Enforcement policy has been under the control of Democratic appointees of President Barack Obama since 2009. An FTC spokesman and a Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Despite the dissatisfaction, the poll found no consensus about companies that ought to be broken up. Asked to name a company or industry in the United States where there was an illegal monopoly, common answers included none, government, cable, oil, Microsoft and banking. Thousands of lawyers, economists and other antitrust experts are converging in Washington, D.C., this week for what is billed as the largest conference on competition law in the world. The meeting of the American Bar Association’s antitrust section runs through Friday at a hotel two blocks from the White House.

569,CMCSA,A string of mega deals drives global M&A; recovery in first quarter,"LONDON (Reuters) - A string of large transactions drove the value of global mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) activity up by 54 percent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, reflecting greater deal-making confidence among chief executives. The value of worldwide announced deals totaled $710 billion in the first three months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data, which includes competing bids for Time Warner Cable and SFR. Global M&A; is up 35 percent excluding these competing bids. Almost half of the M&A; pot came from deals worth $5 billion or more. The number of deals however dropped by 14 percent, the slowest year-to-date period for dealmaking by number of deals since 2003. This means fewer but larger deals have been driving activity so far this year. “There have been several transformational deals and companies have made some bold and aggressive moves. I’m hopeful that we’ll see more of this in 2014.”, said Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A; at JP Morgan. “We’ve seen something of a return of animal spirits.” Comcast Corp trumped Charter Communications with a bid valuing Time Warner Cable at $70.6 billion in enterprise value, the largest transaction in the works since January. Earlier this year, Ireland-based Actavis. the world’s second-largest generic drugmaker, spent $23.8 billion to buy U.S. specialty pharmaceuticals firm Forest Laboratories, its largest acquisition ever. Facebook also made its boldest M&A; move, paying $19.4 billion for its acquisition to grab mobile messaging services firm Whatsapp. While the U.S. continues to stage most of the M&A; action with 51 percent of the market by value of deals so far this year, Europe and Asia-Pacific are gradually catching up with 24 percent and 16 percent of the market. Asia-Pacific had the strongest start of the year on record with announced deals worth $113 billion and 1,751 transaction, according to Thomson Reuters data. M&A; activity in France rose by 673 percent, boosted by SFR and L’Oreal, two of the biggest deals so far this year.

Deals between 1 billion and 5 billion dollars, which usually constitute the sweet spot and are a barometer for the health of the M&A; market, are up 17.5 percent with 91 transactions so far this year. “The pipeline at the moment looks healthier than the number of deals being announced, which means getting deals done remains difficult,” said Jonathan Rowley, co-head of M&A; in Europe, Middle East and Africa at UBS. More generally, high valuations in the equity market and regulatory risk continue to hold back a stronger uptick in M&A; activity, which is still down 17 percent compared to the first quarter of 2007 when M&A; peaked before the crisis, according to TR data. “The number one hurdle is valuation as the pricing of assets is reasonably full and makes it difficult for bidders to pay a premium to the share price,” said Rowley. Regulatory risk is especially threatening Telecoms, Media and Technology (TMT), the most active sectors for M&A; at the moment with a combined 39 percent market share according to TR data, as anti-trust watchdogs around the world seek to protect customers against potential cartels. AT&T;’s blocked acquisition of Deutsche Telekom’s U.S. unit by the U.S. competition authority is still clouding prospects of greater consolidation in the U.S. telecom market. In Europe, the European Commission’s verdict in May over Hutchison’s acquisition of O2 Ireland and Telefonica’s move to buy E-Plus from KPN in Germany is likely to set the mood for in-market consolidation in the industry. “The challenge for M&A; generally is that deals have such a long gestation period and it only takes one bump in the road to slow things down.”, said Greg Lemkau, co-head of global M&A; at Goldman Sachs. “But while there will always be geopolitical or macro risks, the risk that is more acute to M&A; right now is the regulatory environment.” With the main ingredients for M&A; now in place - cheap funding, cash-rich corporates, a relatively stable macroeconomic environment and strong equity market -, those having the guts to complement organic growth through acquisitions have so far been rewarded on average. “It’s an opportune time for CEOs to think about their ‘dream deal’”, said Lemkau. Another encouraging sign is that most acquirers of the biggest transactions so far this year saw their share price rise on the back of their deals, except Facebook. “Immediate stock price reaction is something people are focused on, perhaps overly so, but it does influence the psyche of boards and CEOs. I don’t think this recent wave of positive stock price reaction is driving companies to do deals solely for that reason, but it has reduced one of the key anxieties of an acquirer,” said Lemkau. Finally, activist investors targeting underperforming companies are expected by bankers to aim at more firms in the United States and even in Europe following recent successes. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn pocketed $600 million earlier this year after his successful push within Forest Laboratories to sell to Actavis. Recent companies targeted by activist investors include UK retailer Morrisons, UK transport companies Firstgroup, Swiss bank UBS, U.S. computer network equipment Juniper Networks, eBay, Abercrombie and several oil & gas majors. While importing the activist model from the United States to Europe is unlikely to bring the same results because boards and executives are more closely aligned in Europe, targeted activism handled behind closed-doors could well lead to more M&A.; “Activist investors and funds are increasingly targeting Europe; obviously, they are adapting their approach to the European corporate landscape,” said Yoel Zaoui, co-founder of Zaoui & Co advisory boutique, who recently advised L’Oreal and Peugeot alongside his brother Michael on two of the largest transactions in Europe since the beginning of the year.

571,CMCSA,Comcast divestitures may be worth roughly $18 billion: source,"(Reuters) - The 3 million subscribers that Comcast Corp plans to divest as part of a proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc might be worth roughly $18 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter. The company has received strong interest from other cable companies and investors, the source added. While the subscribers could be sold off, Comcast is also considering a spinoff of the assets into a separate publicly traded company. At $18 billion, the 3 million subscribers would be valued at approximately $6,000 each. The value of the subscribers can change, depending on their location and the financial health of their cable network, the source added. ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said $6000 per subscriber would only be a reasonable valuation for a top tier cable market, and would represent a premium to other publicly listed cable companies that average between $4000-$5000 per subscriber. “We don’t know which markets these are, but if these are contiguous subscribers in smaller markets and not New York for example, I don’t know if Comcast can get $6000 per subscriber,” he said. Comcast said on Monday it is planning to increase its share buyback program by more than 80 percent as the $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable undergoes regulatory review. Comcast is considering adding $2.5 billion to its current $3 billion buyback plan, a Comcast representative said. The size of the repurchase could be higher, depending on the proceeds from the sale of assets related to the divestitures, the company added. Comcast can increase the buyback after Time Warner Cable shareholders vote to approve the deal, the company said. A date has not been set yet for the vote. Comcast has said it is willing to divest 3 million subscribers to reduce the concerns about competition of U.S. regulators. The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission are expected to take months to review the merger, focusing on antitrust and public interest concerns, respectively After the takeover, Comcast would have a footprint spanning from New York to Los Angeles, with a nearly 30 percent share of the pay TV market, as well as a strong position in providing broadband Internet services. Bloomberg earlier reported on the increased share repurchase and that Comcast divestitures could be worth at least $17.6 billion.

573,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-Cisco rival Arista Networks files for IPO,"* Arista led by ex-Cisco exec Jayashree Ullal, also top shareholder * Arista’s switches power data centers of Facebook, Citigroup, Comcast * Lists Morgan Stanley and Citigroup lead underwriters   (Adds industry background, details from IPO filing) March 31 (Reuters) - Arista Networks Inc, which makes network switches for large data centers, filed for an initial public offering on Monday, the latest in a string of cloud computing firms tapping investor enthusiasm around the technology. Arista’s filing comes a week after data storage provider Box Inc filed to raise up to $250 million in one of Silicon Valley’s most highly anticipated IPOs of the year. Box rival Dropbox is expected to file plans for an IPO in the coming months. Santa Clara, California-based Arista listed Morgan Stanley and Citigroup as lead underwriters to the offering in its IPO filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. The company, whose competitors include Cisco Systems Inc , said it would raise $200 million from the offering, but the final size of the IPO could be different. The company, led by former Cisco executive Jayashree Ullal, builds switches that handle traffic at large internet data centers for companies including Facebook Inc, Yahoo Inc , Comcast Corp and Citigroup Inc. Ullal has been CEO since October 2008 and is also Arista’s largest individual shareholder, according to the IPO filing. Cloud technology distributes large amounts of data and applications across multiple servers, allowing companies to cut costs by outsourcing data management and computing needs. Reuters reported in November that Arista had selected banks for a possible IPO. Industry analysts have estimated that the company could be valued at about $2.5 billion. Arista said it would list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ANET”. It did not reveal how many shares it planned to sell or their expected price. The company was started in 2004 by Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton, a computer science professor at Stanford University, with $100 million in funding. The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filing is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different.

575,CMCSA,Comcast: Business services is sweet spot in Time Warner Cable deal,"(Reuters) - Selling Internet and phone service to businesses is hardly the sexiest part of the cable industry, but it has got a definite allure for the architects of the $45.2 billion merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable. The two companies’ sales to businesses of broadband Internet, voice lines and network services already total more than $5 billion, with the growth rate of 20 percent or more expected to be kept up at both the companies’ business units. If the merger is approved, the two companies’ networks will run through 23 of the 25 largest cities - including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas - giving the merged company a reach that rivals AT&T; and Verizon in the $60 billion market for core telecom services such as Internet access and voice services, according to IDC. The push to grab more business clients also reflects how cable companies are searching for new growth avenues as their traditional business, selling TV services to residential clients, matures. “If the Time Warner Cable deal is meant to come about, and therefore we have a bigger footprint, then it opens up a great landscape to bring customers business solutions they never had before,” Comcast’s president of business services Bill Stemper said in an interview. Unlike fickle residential customers who often defect for satellite and telephone competitors, businesses tend to sign long-term contracts with at least six months lead time. Equally important, these contracts have richer margins than serving home customers. Comcast, for example, can bring in more than $50,000-$100,000 per month and potentially millions in revenue per year from a single customer like a large hospital. Last year, Comcast generated $3.2 billion in business service sales, growing at a 26 percent rate, while revenue for residential cable increased 3 percent. The 22 percent growth in Time Warner Cable’s $2.3 billion business service sales helped to offset a small 1.2 percent increase in its residential sales. That being said, this remains a small slice of revenue - about 10 percent for Time Warner Cable, and about 8 percent of Comcast’s cable unit. Both companies have a diverse roster of clients, with Comcast’s ranging from potato chip maker Utz to Grady Health, a public health system in Georgia. Time Warner Cable’s clients include Hospital Corporation of America and energy holding company SCANA Corp. With Time Warner Cable’s top markets New York and Los Angeles in the mix, Comcast can now serve new branches of clients it already has in Philadelphia and Chicago. “That allows us to go to a business whether they’re headquartered in New York or have a key linchpin site in New York, and speak to them about how these same services can serve more of these sites,” Comcast’s Stemper said. So far, both cable operators generate most of their sales in small-to-medium sized businesses, companies with 20 or fewer employees. However, in the past few years they have made a push for bigger companies with as many as 500 employees. Indeed, executives at both companies have said the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger will give it an entry to bigger customers, and a chance to get more business from the largest Fortune 500 companies, which could steal market share served by telecom providers such as AT&T;, Verizon and CenturyLink. “The combined entity offers a very compelling value proposition to large enterprise companies that require a nationwide provider of communication services,” said Phil Meeks, Time Warner Cable’s executive vice president and chief operating officer of business services. Meeks said Time Warner Cable is also already serving some Fortune 500 companies through its cloud computing arm it acquired in 2011 called NaviSite. Still, the combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable could face some major obstacles in moving beyond the small businesses clientele. “The higher you move upmarket, the tougher it’s going to be. The combined company will have a bigger regional footprint than AT&T; and Verizon but AT&T; and Verizon have developed a national structure that’ll be hard to crack,” IDC analyst Matt Davis said. Verizon spokeswoman Janet Brumfield said the company has amassed what it believes is the greatest set of assets in the enterprise business, serving 96 percent of Fortune 1000 companies. AT&T; declined to comment. Meanwhile, Comcast and Time Warner Cable are looking at developing a presentation to existing and potential clients, but they can only start actually selling the services once the deal closes, Meeks said. They are also in pursuit of the same three sectors: healthcare, government and education. The executives leading the business units, Stemper and Meeks, have similar backgrounds, both having worked at Cox Communications, one of the first cable companies to get into business services two decades years ago, and AT&T;, which they are both now competing with. Even without the deal, Stemper from Comcast said of annual business services revenue: “we see the ability to grow to the $4 billion, $5 billion and $6 billion-plus (range) in the road ahead.” ",4012014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-twc-business-analysis/comcast-business-services-is-sweet-spot-in-time-warner-cable-deal-idUSBREA3022F20140401

578,CMCSA,Comcast defends Time Warner Cable deal as U.S. review kicks off,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp sought to rebut critics of its planned $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc, arguing that newcomers like Google Inc and Apple Inc would ensure competition in both Internet and video markets. In a 175-page filing with the Federal Communications Commission that kicks off the FCC’s review of the deal, Comcast argues that combined with Time Warner Cable, it will compete with an “array of sophisticated companies with national or even global footprints” such as Google, Netflix Inc or Verizon that have gained ground against Comcast. “In the evolving video marketplace in which these companies have thrived, there is no reason why a cable company should be limited in evolving as well,” Comcast’s filing said. “Over the last few years, our competitors have evolved into being much larger companies by revenue, by cash flow and or by customers than we are to all have a larger geographic scope than we have,” Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen told reporters after the filing was made public on Tuesday. If approved by the Justice Department and the FCC, the merger would result in a company that would serve just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market, after Comcast’s plan to divest 3 million subscribers. The merged provider would also serve between 20 percent and 40 percent of U.S. broadband subscribers, depending on whether wireless broadband offered by telecom companies is included, Comcast said. Opponents have raised concerns that the sheer size of the merged company would give it too much control over what Americans can watch on television and do online as Comcast boosts its power as a buyer of web and pay-TV content. “The great equalizer is that for many of those companies, they don’t own the network in the high-speed video marketplace,” said Chris Lewis, vice president for government affairs at consumer interest group Public Knowledge, referring to Google, Apple, Netflix and other content providers Comcast cited as its growing competitors. Cohen and Time Warner Cable’s finance chief Arthur Minson are expected to hear about these concerns when they testify at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll last month found a majority of Americans skeptical about the proposed merger, with 52 percent of the 1,368 surveyed people saying that mergers such as the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal result in less competition and are bad for consumers. Comcast shares on Tuesday traded at their lowest level since the Time Warner deal was announced in February, a four-month low of $48.24 per share, and were 0.3 percent lower in the session. Since announcing its bid, Comcast has underscored that the merger combines two companies that do not directly compete in any markets, meaning no consumer would lose a choice of an Internet or cable provider. It has argued that Time Warner Cable’s customers would see a boost in quality of their services and the speed of their Internet. However, while lack of direct competition does away with major antitrust concerns that could trigger a block from the Justice Department, the FCC gets much broader leeway in examining whether the deal is in the public interest. Cohen said in more than 98 percent of the broadband markets served by Comcast and Time Warner Cable, customers have another Internet service choice offered by a top-ten telecom provider, delivered through fiber or new-generation DSL, plus newer entrants such as Google Fiber. Comcast also made the case that its sales of service including broadband to small and large businesses could present companies with an alternative to telecom providers such as Verizon and AT&T.; The company also reaffirmed its commitment to so-called network neutrality rules, which ban Internet providers from slowing down or blocking access to content online, and that have been struck down by a court as formal FCC rules in January.

579,CMCSA,U.S. mulls impact of Comcast-TWC deal on programming: cable executive,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Executives from Veria Living, a U.S. cable television channel, met in March with Justice Department officials who are digging into the Comcast deal to buy Time Warner Cable, even before the government was formally notified of the proposed transaction, Veria’s CEO told Reuters. Veria chief Eric Sherman said he and other company executives met with nine Justice Department antitrust attorneys, including two trial attorneys, on March 10 for nearly 90 minutes after Veria contacted the department. Comcast Corp said in February that it planned to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion, and formally requested antitrust approval on March 31. Sherman told Reuters that the Justice Department attorneys asked about obstacles that small independent channels like Veria Living might face in getting picked up by cable giants like Comcast or Time Warner Cable. That line of questioning suggests one of the elements that the U.S. government could focus on as it considers the potential implications of the merger. The Federal Communications Commission will examine whether the deal is in the public interest while the Justice Department will determine whether it complies with antitrust law. Smaller channels worry that since Comcast also owns NBC Universal, which has its own rich trove of movies and television shows, they will have little chance of being added to a cable network’s lineup. That situation will become worse if Time Warner Cable becomes part of Comcast, some small channels have said. The problem of content providers was also an issue when the government approved Comcast’s purchase of NBC Universal in 2011. As part of that approval, Comcast pledged to provide 10 new independent channels. It has added five so far. Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said that the company was proud of its relationship with independent programmers. “Channel carriage has costs both in direct and indirect ways which must be balanced for our consumers. We continue to work to carry a wide variety of channels that our customers most want in a balanced way,” Fitzmaurice said in a statement. Veria, which focuses on health and wellness programming, is carried by DISH Network, FiOS, RCN and others but not by Comcast or Time Warner Cable.

581,CMCSA,UPDATE 3-Comcast defends Time Warner Cable deal as U.S. review kicks off,"* Comcast launches formal review by U.S. FCC * Reiterates pledge to divest 3 million subscribers * Says merger would not eliminate cable or broadband competition   (Recasts throughout; adds details on broadband market) By Alina Selyukh and Liana B. Baker WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, April 8 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp  sought to rebut critics of its planned $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc, arguing that newcomers like Google Inc and Apple Inc would ensure competition in both Internet and video markets. In a 175-page filing with the Federal Communications Commission that kicks off the FCC’s review of the deal, Comcast argues that combined with Time Warner Cable, it will compete with an “array of sophisticated companies with national or even global footprints” such as Google, Netflix Inc or Verizon that have gained ground against Comcast. “In the evolving video marketplace in which these companies have thrived, there is no reason why a cable company should be limited in evolving as well,” Comcast’s filing said. “Over the last few years, our competitors have evolved into being much larger companies by revenue, by cash flow and or by customers than we are to all have a larger geographic scope than we have,” Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen told reporters after the filing was made public on Tuesday. If approved by the Justice Department and the FCC, the merger would result in a company that would serve just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market, after Comcast’s plan to divest 3 million subscribers. The merged provider would also serve between 20 percent and 40 percent of U.S. broadband subscribers, depending on whether wireless broadband offered by telecom companies is included, Comcast said. Opponents have raised concerns that the sheer size of the merged company would give it too much control over what Americans can watch on television and do online as Comcast boosts its power as a buyer of web and pay-TV content. “The great equalizer is that for many of those companies, they don’t own the network in the high-speed video marketplace,” said Chris Lewis, vice president for government affairs at consumer interest group Public Knowledge, referring to Google, Apple, Netflix and other content providers Comcast cited as its growing competitors. Cohen and Time Warner Cable’s finance chief Arthur Minson are expected to hear about these concerns when they testify at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll last month found a majority of Americans skeptical about the proposed merger, with 52 percent of the 1,368 surveyed people saying that mergers such as the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal result in less competition and are bad for consumers. Comcast shares on Tuesday traded at their lowest level since the Time Warner deal was announced in February, a four-month low of $48.24 per share, and were 0.3 percent lower in the session. Since announcing its bid, Comcast has underscored that the merger combines two companies that do not directly compete in any markets, meaning no consumer would lose a choice of an Internet or cable provider. It has argued that Time Warner Cable’s customers would see a boost in quality of their services and the speed of their Internet. However, while lack of direct competition does away with major antitrust concerns that could trigger a block from the Justice Department, the FCC gets much broader leeway in examining whether the deal is in the public interest. Cohen said in more than 98 percent of the broadband markets served by Comcast and Time Warner Cable, customers have another Internet service choice offered by a top-ten telecom provider, delivered through fiber or new-generation DSL, plus newer entrants such as Google Fiber. Comcast also made the case that its sales of service including broadband to small and large businesses could present companies with an alternative to telecom providers such as Verizon and AT&T.; The company also reaffirmed its commitment to so-called network neutrality rules, which ban Internet providers from slowing down or blocking access to content online, and that have been struck down by a court as formal FCC rules in January. Comcast, thanks to a condition placed on its 2011 merger with NBC Universal, is now the only company bound to uphold net neutrality for the next five years and has promised to apply it post-merger when it becomes larger. The FCC is now reviewing how to rewrite the net neutrality and the treatment of web traffic, including the fees content companies pay Internet service providers in so-called interconnection deals, is likely to be part of the agency’s review of the merger.

583,CMCSA,U.S. lawmakers press Comcast on Time Warner Cable merger,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc executives sought to reassure lawmakers on Wednesday that their planned merger would not send cable TV prices skyrocketing but found a fair amount of congressional skepticism. The Senate Judiciary Committee held the first public hearing on the proposed $45.2 billion merger between the two largest U.S. cable companies, a deal that has raised eyebrows among public interest groups and some lawmakers. Comcast promises that it will benefit consumers without eliminating any choices. “My concern is that as Comcast continues to get bigger, it will have even more power to exercise its leverage and squeeze consumers,” said Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat who has often opposed media concentration. “I’m against this deal,” Franken added. “I believe this deal will result in fewer choices, higher prices, and even worse service for my constituents.” Lawmakers can be a powerful voice on merger deliberations although they will have no formal role in deciding whether the Comcast deal gets the green light from the Justice Department, which ensures the merger complies with antitrust law, and the Federal Communications Commission, which has a broader public-interest standard. In a bid to make the merger more palatable, Comcast has pledged to divest 3 million subscribers, keeping the combined company’s customer base just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television market. The merged company would also serve between 20 percent and 40 percent of the high-speed Internet market, Comcast said in a filing on Tuesday with the FCC. “If this transaction is approved, it will give us the scale and reach to innovate and compete against our national and global competitors. ... The transaction will not lead to any reduction in competition or consumer choice in any market,” Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen told lawmakers. “There is nothing in this transaction will cause anyone’s cable bills to go up,” Cohen said, reiterating that the two merging companies do not compete against each other anywhere. The company also argues that its rivals no longer consist of other cable or satellite TV companies, but also companies like Google Inc, Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. These companies have made progress in competing against Comcast with video content, while cable operators have lost subscribers. The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on the deal on May 8, the panel said on Wednesday. The FCC’s review of the merger is expected to focus on how Comcast would manage Internet traffic crossing its networks. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, urged Comcast to extend its commitment to so-called network neutrality beyond 2018. In January a court struck down FCC’s net neutrality rules that ban Internet providers from slowing down or blocking access to content online, but Comcast remains bound by them through 2018 as a condition of its 2011 merger with NBC Universal. “The conditions that currently apply to Comcast should not be seen as the end point, but rather the minimum level of protection that should apply to promote competition online,” Leahy said. “I urge Comcast to support stronger rules that will protect consumers and drive innovation.” Cohen replied that the FCC, which is looking to rewrite the rules, would probably get new industrywide net neutrality rules in place quickly enough that Comcast would not need to make such a commitment. “I can’t imagine that the commission is not going to have those rules in place well before 2018,” he said. Cohen, sitting next to Time Warner Cable’s finance chief Arthur Minson, testified alongside an independent programmer and a smaller Wi-Fi company who said they worried the larger Comcast would use its power to bully them. Senator Richard Blumenthal said he was concerned that a bigger Comcast would have a strong incentive to overcharge for sports programming sold to other broadcasters. He also noted that cable bills were going up faster than inflation. “These markets are plagued with anticompetitive conduct,” said the Connecticut Democrat. While large content providers such as Disney have few concerns about the merger, some small, upcoming channels worry that a bigger, stronger Comcast will essentially decide if they succeed or fail. James Bosworth, head of the golf-oriented Back9 Network, said Comcast was reluctant to pick up independent programming that competed against its own, like the Golf Channel. The Internet is not a viable option for new channels because online advertising rates are so much lower than broadcast rates, Bosworth told lawmakers. “Americans watch 20 times more video on television than online,” he added. Their concerns were echoed by Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official who is now a vocal opponent of the merger as head of Washington-based public interest group Public Knowledge. “The issue before antitrust officials and communications regulators is really very, very simple,” Kimmelman said. “If we want more innovative, low-price Internet-delivered services, this merger must be rejected.” ",4092014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-timewarnercable-cohen/u-s-lawmakers-press-comcast-on-time-warner-cable-merger-idUSBREA3816X20140409

585,CMCSA,"US STOCKS-Wall St climbs for second day, Fed minutes on tap","* Internet, biotech stocks lead gains * Fed minutes scheduled for release at 2:00 p.m. EDT * Senator opposes Comcast deal to buy Time Warner Cable * Indexes up: Dow 0.3 pct, S&P; 0.3 pct, Nasdaq 0.7 pct   (Updates to midday) By Angela Moon NEW YORK, April 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose for a second session on Wednesday, buoyed by a rise in Alcoa shares ahead of the release of minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Alcoa Inc gained 3.6 percent to $12.98 as the best performer on the S&P; 500 after it reported a decline in first quarter adjusted profit but earnings still came in ahead of analysts’ expectations. S&P; 500 companies’ first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased just 1 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent. U.S. stocks had advanced in the prior session to snap a three-day losing streak as investors bought beaten-down social media and Internet shares. Despite the three-day selloff, the benchmark S&P; 500 index  managed to hold above its 50-day moving average around 1,840, a key support level. The index has successfully defended the 1,840 area several times over the past month. The day’s gains were gain led by Internet and biotechnology stocks that had tumbled recently. The Nasdaq biotechnology index was up 2.2 percent at 2,409.72 and the Global X social media index was up 1.8 percent at $18.83. “In recent days, in general, large caps outperformed small caps, and low-beta companies outperformed those with higher betas,” said U.S. Bank Wealth Management’s equity research team, in a note to clients. Low beta refers to less volatile stocks that also offer less potential return. “While investor sentiment remains fragile, we continue to maintain a constructive outlook for equities, believing that the path of least resistance is still up.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.81 points or 0.34 percent, to 16,311.95, the S&P; 500 gained 5.55 points or 0.3 percent, to 1,857.51 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 28.137 points or 0.68 percent, to 4,141.123. Year-to-date, five of the ten S&P; 500 Index sectors are up and five are down, according to Wells Fargo Advisors. The utility sector leads the rest with a 9.5 percent increase, while the consumer discretionary sector has been the greatest laggard with a 5.5 percent decline. The Fed is expected to release the minutes from its March meeting at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT). The Fed needs to be more specific about what economic conditions would prompt it to raise interest rates from current rock-bottom levels, a pair of top Fed officials normally at odds on policy said on Tuesday. Earnings season gets under way this week, with results due from retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond after the close, while financials JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co  close out the week with results on Friday. Investors will be looking at the impact of harsh winter weather on first-quarter earnings, and signs of optimism for the second-quarter. U.S. wholesale inventories rose at a slower 0.5 percent pace in February, in line with expectations, after a revised 0.8 percent gain in January, which could support views that restocking did not help the economy in the first quarter. General Motors Co shares lost 2 percent to $33.83. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the automaker is being fined $7,000 a day for missing an April 3 deadline to provide information about its recall of 2.6 million cars for defective ignition switches. Morgan Stanley subsequently cut the stock to “underweight.” Intuitive Surgical Inc estimated first-quarter revenue well below analysts’ average expectation, mainly due to a 60 percent drop in sales of its flagship da Vinci robot system. Its shares slumped 7 percent to $455.27. The PHLX medical device index lost 0.3 percent. Constant Contact Inc surged 27.8 percent to $28.02 after the online marketer said it expects quarterly revenue to rise by more than 15 percent. Shares of Blackstone-backed hotel chain La Quinta Holdings Inc made a subdued market debut as investors took the view the stock was fully priced in a crowded IPO market. La Quinta’s shares, which priced below the expected range at $17, fell as much as 4 percent in early trading but rose nearly 3 percent to $17.50 by midday.

591,CMCSA,"Comcast, Time Warner to face lawmakers on merger plan","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Executives from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N are expected to defend their plan to merge as they go before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, the first hearing since the $45.2-billion deal was announced in February. The proposed merger has stirred the ire of public interest groups who worry that a bigger Comcast would have too much clout over fast-growing broadband, free rein to raise cable rates and more power over what Americans watch on television. David Cohen, executive vice president of Comcast, and Arthur Minson, TWC’s finance chief are expected to argue that their cable and broadband services do not compete with each other. Time Warner customers also stand to get faster Internet speeds and better cable service, the companies have said. Further, they are likely to reiterate that Comcast faces competition in both Internet and video markets from the likes of Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) - an argument Comcast made in filings with the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday. A primary concern for Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and chair of the committee, is “diverse and independent video programming.” “Cable companies play a dominant role in how many people in this country get information. Consumers deserve to know how a merger between two of the largest companies in this industry will impact them,” Leahy said in prepared testimony. Senator Amy Klobuchar, chair of the committee’s antitrust panel and a Minnesota Democrat, is worried about both cable and broadband. “I will specifically be looking at how the proposed merger will impact prices and service, how it would affect Comcast’s control over programming and what people are able to watch, and how it would change Comcast’s control over people’s access to the Internet,” she said in a statement. Also due to appear on Wednesday is Gene Kimmelman, head of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge and a vocal opponent of the merger. Kimmelman was at the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division in 2011 when it approved the merger of Comcast and NBC Universal but stopped AT&T;’s (T.N) proposed purchase of T-Mobile USA (DTEGn.DE). “The merger will even more firmly entrench Comcast as the gatekeeper at the crossroads of Internet, television, and communications innovation,” Kimmelman’s testimony says. In an effort to win approval Comcast has pledged to divest 3 million subscribers so the combined company’s customer base of 30 million would be just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television market. The combined company would also serve between 20 and 40 percent of the high-speed Internet market, Comcast said in Tuesday’s filing. Rounding out Wednesday’s panel are James Bosworth from Back9Network, an independent golf channel; Richard Sherwin from Spot On Networks, a managed Wi-Fi provider; and Christopher Yoo, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. The Justice Department will review the merger to ensure it complies with antitrust law. The Federal Communications Commission has a broader public interest standard. Attorneys general from Florida, Indiana and several other states are also looking at the deal.

Public interest groups and some lawmakers have opposed a merger, saying it would allow Comcast to raise cable television rates and gain more power over what Americans watch on TV or online. In Tuesday’s newspaper, the newspaper’s editorial board said these concerns were not enough for the Federal Communications Commission to “take the severe step” of blocking a deal, but warranted conditions “that allow a crackdown” if cable companies begin to treat competitors and upstarts unfairly. “The government’s smartest move is not to block the merger, but to make clear that regulators will respond if big industry players begin to violate basic principles of market fairness,” the editorial said. The FCC will determine whether the merger is in the public interest and the Justice Department must decide whether it complies with antitrust law. Comcast last week laid out the arguments in favor of its deal in a lengthy public interest filing at the FCC and then at a congressional hearing. The company has said its business faces powerful competitors like Google Inc or Apple Inc, and has stressed that Comcast and Time Warner Cable do not directly compete in any market. The Washington Post laid out some arguments for and against the deal and concluded that the foggy outlook for the future of communications and entertainment “recommends a degree of regulatory caution.” (Read the editorial here: wapo.st/1hQFUxl ) More than 50 consumer advocacy groups and Democratic Senator Al Franken, a vocal critic of media concentration, oppose the merger.

594,CMCSA,Comcast in talks with Charter over divestitures: source,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) is in talks with Charter Communications (CHTR.O) over selling or spinning off roughly 3 million subscribers worth approximately $18 billion to $20 billion as part of the divestitures related to its $45.3 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable TWC.N, according to a source familiar with the matter. The talks center around either a straight sale of 3 million or so subscribers, or the potential creation of a spinoff in which Charter would buy a substantial minority stake, the source added. There may be other options the two companies are discussing, the source said, adding that while the negotiations with Charter are serious, they are still in the early stages and could fall apart. Other cable companies also are interested in Comcast’s divested subscribers, according to the source. The Financial Times first reported the news of the talks with Charter. A Comcast spokesman declined to comment on Saturday while representatives for Time Warner Cable and Charter could not be reached for comment. Executives from Comcast and Time Warner Cable earlier this month sought to reassure lawmakers that the merger between the two largest U.S. cable companies would not result in higher prices for cable TV and Internet packages. Comcast already has pledged to divest 3 million subscribers to keep the combined company’s subscriber base just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television market. The source said that the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal has to be approved by regulators before any divestitures occur. However, Comcast could reach an agreement earlier with another cable company such as Charter, whose largest investor is John Malone’s Liberty Media LMCA.O, that would be contingent on the merger being approved by regulators. The 3 million subscriber number could still change but, the source said, it would unlikely be as large as 5 million subscribers. The location of the subscribers in question was unknown. The merged company would serve between 20 percent to 40 percent of high-speed Internet customers in the United States, Comcast has said in a Federal Communications Commission filing. The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee is expected to hold a hearing on the deal early next month.

596,CMCSA,Netflix gloves come off against Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger,"April 21 (Reuters) - Video streaming service Netflix on Monday became the most visible company with a business relationship with Comcast to oppose the No. 1 cable operator’s $45.3 billion merger with Time Warner Cable. “It’s more in the public interest to either not have them merge or if the government goes ahead with it, to at least put some significant merger agreements, settlements in there,” Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said in a webcast following the company’s quarterly results. Netflix added in a quarterly letter to shareholders that Comcast would control access to broadband in a majority of U.S. homes while also having “anticompetitive leverage” to charge arbitrary fees on companies that rely on its Internet service. Until now, the only vocal advocates calling for an outright rejection of Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger had been public interest and consumer groups such as Public Knowledge and the Consumers Union, as well as Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat who has often opposed media concentration. Netflix has tussled with the cable operator in recent months over the speed Comcast delivers the online streaming service to its cable customers. In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service. While Netflix and Comcast announced the news in a joint statement that sounded friendly at the time, just a month later, Netflix’s Hastings blasted Comcast for charging these interconnection fees in a blog post. In an interview with Reuters on Monday, the Netflix executive said he favors the federal government imposing “some enduring form of no-fee interconnect” if the merger is approved by regulators. Comcast quickly responded with a lengthy statement. “Netflix’s opposition to our Time Warner Cable transaction is based on inaccurate claims and arguments,” the cable operator said. “There has been no company that has had a stronger commitment to openness of the Internet than Comcast.” The cable operator noted that, as part of its 2011 acquisition of NBC Universal, it is the only Internet provider that is legally bound to follow the U.S. Federal Communications Commission’ net neutrality rules. Comcast charged that Netflix is using the interconnection argument to “shift its costs from its customers to all Internet customers, regardless of whether they subscribe to Netflix or not.” Netflix’s decision to publicly oppose Comcast’s plan to merge with Time Warner Cable may give the company headaches when it makes its case to the Justice Department that their deal is legal under antitrust law, said Allen Grunes, an antitrust expert with Geyer Gorey LLP law firm. “The significance here is that we know from the (2011) Comcast NBCU deal that DOJ (Justice Department) was worried about Netflix,” said Grunes. “I suspect that Netflix has a whole bunch of information and concerns that could support DOJ bringing a case because this is the person whose business is placed at risk.” Critics of the merger say that a bigger, more powerful Comcast would have the power to throttle Internet traffic. Since announcing its bid for Time Warner Cable in February, Comcast has underscored that the merger combines two companies that do not directly compete in any markets, meaning no consumer would lose a choice of an Internet or cable provider. It has argued that Time Warner Cable’s customers would see a boost in quality of their services and Internet speeds.   (Reporting by Liana B.

597,CMCSA,UPDATE 3-Netflix plans to raise prices as U.S. streaming subcribers grow,"(Adds CEO comments, updates stock price) By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, April 21 (Reuters) - Video streaming service Netflix Inc said it intends to raise the monthly subscription price for new customers by $1 or $2 a month to help the company buy more movies and TV shows and improve service for its 48 million global subscribers. Investors welcomed the announcement by Netflix, which had suffered from a consumer exodus and stock plunge after it announced an unpopular price increase in July 2011. The company’s shares jumped 6.7 percent in after-hours trading to $371.97, after the company released plans for a price hike and posted a rise in first-quarter profit that beat Wall Street expectations. Chief Executive Reed Hastings said Netflix had improved its selection of TV shows and movies and added original series like critically acclaimed Kevin Spacey thriller “House of Cards.” With added revenue from higher prices, “we will be able to license much more content and deliver it in very high quality video,” Hastings said on a webcast. The company, in a quarterly letter to shareholders, said it plans to impose “a one or two dollar increase, depending on the country, later this quarter for new members only.” It did not name the countries. Existing customers would keep their current price “for a generous time period,” it said. Netflix has “room to raise prices,” FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said, because “they’re still seeing a lot of demand” for the service. The company said in its earnings report it added 2.25 million customers to its U.S. streaming business during the quarter that ended in March, in line with the company’s earlier guidance, for a total of 35.7 million. In international markets, its customer base reached 12.7 million, a gain of 1.8 million during the quarter. Net income for the quarter reached $53 million, an increase from $3 million a year earlier. Earnings-per-share came in at 86 cents, topping the average forecast of 83 cents, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the quarter, it released the second season of critically acclaimed Kevin Spacey drama “House of Cards.” Netflix is investing in original series, such as “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black” to attract and keep subscribers. If faces competition from online video players like Amazon.com Inc and Hulu, as well as on-demand content from cable operators. Netflix also said it opposed Comcast Corp’s  proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc. In March, Netflix reluctantly agreed to pay “interconnection” fees to Comcast for faster delivery of its TV shows and movies. “Comcast is already dominant enough to be able to capture unprecedented fees from transit providers and services such as Netflix,” the company said in its letter. “The combined company would possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers.” Netflix said those fees had improved Netflix service for Comcast customers, but singled out AT&T;’s fiber-based U-Verse as providing “lower performance” than many other providers.

598,CMCSA,"Netflix blasts AT&T; fiber network; opposes Comcast, TWC merger","NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc, the video streaming service, on Monday criticized AT&T;’s high-speed fiber network as inadequate and slow, while renewing its call for AT&T; to interconnect directly with Netflix. Netflix made the remarks in a letter to shareholders on its first-quarter results. The company has been calling for greater protections for open Internet rules, also known as net neutrality, which require Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or tiered charges. Netflix, in a letter signed by its chief executive, Reed Hastings, and chief financial officer, David Wells, said AT&T;’s fiber-based U-verse service has “lower performance than many DSL” Internet service providers. The letter came hours after AT&T; said it expects to expand its fiber network and TV services to up to 21 U.S. cities. AT&T; did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a March blog post, AT&T; dismissed Netflix’s call for free interconnection as an “arrogant” and unfair attempt to force others to pay for the content provider to gain access to faster broadband speeds and better services. “The 249 customer comments on AT&T;’s anti-Netflix blog post indicate that AT&T; customers expect a good quality Netflix experience given how much they pay AT&T; for their Internet service,” the Netflix letter said. Netflix added that AT&T; can connect directly with Netflix for free, saying that doing so would “quickly improve their customers’ experience.” Netflix also adressed wider tensions with the Internet service providers it relies on to distribute its services. The company said it opposes the proposed merger between Comcast  and Time Warner Cable because it would give Comcast a monopoly over high-speed broadband and allow it to charge “unprecidented fees” from transit and service providers like Netflix. AT&T;, which is fighting rivals such as Google Inc  as well as cable companies with its fiber-based product, on Monday said it is considering providing broadband Internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second and its U-verse television service in some metropolitan areas, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. Before the company can enter these markets, it must make  agreements with local leaders in each city. The services are currently available in Austin, Texas, and some surrounding communities, and will be rolled out in parts of Dallas this summer, the company said. AT&T; said it may consider expanding its reach to 100 cities eventually. U-verse launched in 2006 and currently has 10.7 million combined Internet and TV customers.

599,CMCSA,Comcast nears deal with Charter on $18-$20 billion in divestitures: source,"(Reuters) - Comcast may divest about 4 million subscribers after its merger with Time Warner Cable and is working to reach an accord to sell a portion of those customers to Charter Communications, a source familiar with the matter said Tuesday. Comcast is studying what could be a two-phase process, where Charter would first acquire up to 1.5 million subscribers directly from Comcast, the source said on condition of anonymity because discussions were continuing and a final agreement had not been struck. Comcast would then spin off the rest of the 2.5 million subscribers into a separate, publicly traded company, which Charter would take a minority stake in, the source added. The roughly 4 million subscribers are worth between $18 billion and $20 billion, said the source. Comcast and Charter would also swap about 1 million cable subscribers, including Charter’s subscribers in Los Angeles. It was not yet clear what markets Comcast would swap with Charter or spin off, although the companies would likely trade subscribers adjacent to their exisiting markets. Any agreement the companies reach would be contingent on Comcast’s $45.3 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable being approved by regulators, a process that could take many more months while the Justice Department and U.S. Federal Communications Commission study that deal. While the source characterized the negotiations as serious, the deal could still fall apart and other cable companies and private equity firms may be interested in the divestitures. Representatives for Comcast and Charter declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg both reported parts of the deal earlier on Tuesday. Comcast and Charter originally teamed up last year to try to find a way to carve up Time Warner Cable. But talks soured as the two bickered over price and the feasibility of engineering a split of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator.

Comcast’s chief financial officer, Michael Angelakis, said on Tuesday there was no timeline governing when the company will make a decision regarding the divestitures.

606,CMCSA,Netflix gloves come off against Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger,"(Reuters) - Video streaming service Netflix on Monday became the most visible company with a business relationship with Comcast (CMCSA.O) to oppose the No. 1 cable operator’s $45.3 billion merger with Time Warner Cable TWC.N. “It’s more in the public interest to either not have them merge or if the government goes ahead with it, to at least put some significant merger agreements, settlements in there,” Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said in a webcast following the company’s quarterly results. Netflix added in a quarterly letter to shareholders that Comcast would control access to broadband in a majority of U.S. homes while also having “anticompetitive leverage” to charge arbitrary fees on companies that rely on its Internet service. Until now, the only vocal advocates calling for an outright rejection of Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger had been public interest and consumer groups such as Public Knowledge and the Consumers Union, as well as Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat who has often opposed media concentration. Netflix has tussled with the cable operator in recent months over the speed Comcast delivers the online streaming service to its cable customers. In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service. While Netflix and Comcast announced the news in a joint statement that sounded friendly at the time, just a month later, Netflix’s Hastings blasted Comcast for charging these interconnection fees in a blog post. In an interview with Reuters on Monday, the Netflix executive said he favors the federal government imposing “some enduring form of no-fee interconnect” if the merger is approved by regulators. Comcast quickly responded with a lengthy statement. “Netflix’s opposition to our Time Warner Cable transaction is based on inaccurate claims and arguments,” the cable operator said. “There has been no company that has had a stronger commitment to openness of the Internet than Comcast.” The cable operator noted that, as part of its 2011 acquisition of NBC Universal, it is the only Internet provider that is legally bound to follow the U.S. Federal Communications Commission’ net neutrality rules. Comcast charged that Netflix is using the interconnection argument to “shift its costs from its customers to all Internet customers, regardless of whether they subscribe to Netflix or not.” Netflix’s decision to publicly oppose Comcast’s plan to merge with Time Warner Cable may give the company headaches when it makes its case to the Justice Department that their deal is legal under antitrust law, said Allen Grunes, an antitrust expert with Geyer Gorey LLP law firm. “The significance here is that we know from the (2011) Comcast NBCU deal that DOJ (Justice Department) was worried about Netflix,” said Grunes. “I suspect that Netflix has a whole bunch of information and concerns that could support DOJ bringing a case because this is the person whose business is placed at risk.” Critics of the merger say that a bigger, more powerful Comcast would have the power to throttle Internet traffic. Since announcing its bid for Time Warner Cable in February, Comcast has underscored that the merger combines two companies that do not directly compete in any markets, meaning no consumer would lose a choice of an Internet or cable provider. It has argued that Time Warner Cable’s customers would see a boost in quality of their services and Internet speeds.

607,CMCSA,UPDATE 4-Netflix plans to raise prices as U.S. streaming subscribers grow,"(Adds CEO comments paragraph 6, Comcast comment paragraph 15) By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, April 21 (Reuters) - Video streaming service Netflix Inc said it intends to raise its subscription price for new customers by $1 or $2 a month to help the company buy more movies and TV shows and improve service for its 48 million global subscribers. Investors welcomed the announcement on Monday by Netflix, which had suffered from a consumer exodus and stock plunge after it announced an unpopular price increase in July 2011. The company’s shares jumped 6.7 percent in after-hours trading to $371.97, after the company released plans for price hikes and posted a rise in first-quarter profit that beat Wall Street expectations. Chief Executive Reed Hastings said Netflix had improved its selection of TV shows and movies and added original series like critically acclaimed Kevin Spacey thriller “House of Cards.” With added revenue from higher prices, “we will be able to license much more content and deliver it in very high quality video,” Hastings said on a webcast. The company, in a quarterly letter to shareholders, said it plans to impose “a one or two dollar increase, depending on the country, later this quarter for new members only.” Subscription fees will rise in each of the 41 countries where Netflix operates, Hastings said in an interview. Existing customers will keep their current price for one to two years, he said. Netflix has “room to raise prices,” FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said, because “they’re still seeing a lot of demand” for the service. The company said in its earnings report it added 2.25 million customers to its U.S. streaming business during the quarter that ended in March, in line with the company’s earlier guidance, for a total of 35.7 million. In international markets, its customer base reached 12.7 million, a gain of 1.8 million during the quarter. Net income for the quarter reached $53 million, an increase from $3 million a year earlier. Earnings-per-share came in at 86 cents, topping the average forecast of 83 cents, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the quarter, it released the second season of critically acclaimed Kevin Spacey drama “House of Cards.” Netflix is investing in original series, such as “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black” to attract and keep subscribers. If faces competition from online video players like Amazon.com Inc and Hulu, as well as on-demand content from cable operators. Netflix also said it opposed Comcast Corp’s  proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc. In March, Netflix reluctantly agreed to pay “interconnection” fees to Comcast for faster delivery of its TV shows and movies. “Comcast is already dominant enough to be able to capture unprecedented fees from transit providers and services such as Netflix,” the company said in its letter. “The combined company would possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers.” Netflix said those fees had improved Netflix service for Comcast customers, but singled out AT&T;’s fiber-based U-Verse as providing “lower performance” than many other providers. Comcast responded in a statement that the Netflix opposition to the planned merger was “based on inaccurate claims and arguments.” “There has been no company that has had a stronger commitment to openness of the Internet than Comcast,” the company said.

609,CMCSA,"AOL, Microsoft lure advertisers with TV-style shows","NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Technology powerhouses like Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc are flexing their muscles as storytellers, parading TV network-style shows before advertisers at an annual digital content showcase in New York next week. With an eye on the big bucks such shows can command, Microsoft will trot out a soccer reality show called “Every Street United.” Sony Corp’s digital network Crackle will serve up Jerry Seinfeld’s “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New Yorkers called “Connected.” This is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long “NewFronts” event - modeled after the annual “upfronts” where broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison Avenue. Yahoo Inc is also looking for longer original programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the deals have yet to be finalized. Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo’s earnings call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more focused investments in original content. “We are going to see more original content overall and no doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV because they have their eyes on TV dollars,” said Kris Magel, chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying division of Interpublic Group of Cos. But TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online video commercials that usually run before and during a program, advertisers and analysts said. “Online video just doesn’t offer nearly the reach that broadcast does,” said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. AOL has spent about half a billion dollars over the last three years on shorter content. On Wednesday, it also inked a deal with Miramax to stream the independent studio’s films on the AOL network for free, but with ads. “Internet companies are bucketed into the snackable short form space,” Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video, said. “But we are seeing the growth in the consumption of content on big screens.” At the NewFronts, which starts on April 28, Microsoft will show longer original shows produced by the company’s Xbox Entertainment Studios that exploit the Internet’s strengths. “The challenge TV has is it’s not very effective in being able to reach a very discrete target audience and measure it and have more interactive components,” said Scott Ferris, general manager of TV and video advertising for Microsoft. “We have very engaged, high-quality audiences.” Online series can get messages in front of people who watch little TV, said Peter Naylor, senior vice president of sales for Hulu.com. The website, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and 21st Century Fox, will also pitch shows to advertisers next week. “There is a segment of the video universe that is very, very hard to reach through traditional television,” Naylor said. “Online video is a way to reach those light TV viewers.” But because online viewers have to search for content, advertisers may end up paying more to reach them than on TV. The cost per thousand (CPM) for a commercial on a cable network, for example, might be between $10 to $30, depending on the show and the demographic, estimates Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. For online video, a CPM for a comparable demographic could be in the range of $20 to “There is a lot of aspiration in the NewFronts initiatives,” said Wieser. “The reality is traditional TV budgets are intended for content vehicles that are TV-like. (Content) with short term, low budgets with unknown or even known talent is unlikely to capture anything resembling a meaningful TV budget.” Another hurdle is that the money that presenters make from the NewFronts is not tracked by the Internet Advertising Bureau which hosts the event. Ari Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry’s annual showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue online. However, it may take some time before online shows become mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars. Until then, the NewFronts “is more of a showcase for what’s new and exciting,” Bluman said.

614,CMCSA,"UPDATE 2-Netflix sees competition down, fees up if Comcast, TWC combine","(Adds comment from Comcast) By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON, April 24 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc, which opposes the proposed Comcast deal to buy rival Time Warner Cable Inc, outlined on Thursday the ways it thinks competition will be hurt if the merger goes ahead, most notably in the extraction of “arbitrary tolls.” The popular video streaming service responded in a letter to Senator Al Franken, a vocal critic of the deal, saying a combined Comcast Corp and TWC, would mean video providers would pay more to get their movies and television shows into viewers’ living rooms. “Comcast is limiting the capacity of connections between its network and other networks, unless the network agrees to pay Comcast for access,” Netflix Vice President Christopher Libertelli wrote in the letter to Franken, a Minnesota Democrat. “Consumers experience these delays as slow page loads, poor streaming quality, and frequent streaming pauses,” Libertelli wrote in the letter released by the senator’s office. In a response, Comcast accused Netflix of trying to shift the costs of its bandwidth-heavy business onto all Internet users rather than just Netflix users, and said it has many agreements similar to the one with Netflix. “Those agreements have not harmed consumers or increased costs for content providers. If anything, they have decreased the costs those providers would have paid to others,” said Jennifer Khoury, a Comcast spokeswoman. Comcast, the No. 1 U.S. cable company that also owns NBC Universal, said in February it would buy rival cable and broadband provider Time Warner Cable, angering consumer groups who fear the pricing power of the combined entity. Franken soon joined the criticism, and Netflix came out in opposition to the deal on Monday. Netflix made a similar point in a blog post on Thursday. “We’re very concerned that a combined Comcast-TWC will place toll taking above consumer interests,” wrote Ken Florence, vice president of content delivery at Netflix. “Comcast is double dipping by getting both its subscribers and Internet content providers to pay for access to each other.” Netflix streaming accounts for nearly one-third of all Internet traffic in North America during peak times, according to research by broadband networking equipment company Sandvine Corp. Comcast has defended the merger by saying that the two companies do not directly compete in any market, meaning no consumer would lose a choice of an Internet or cable provider. A Senate panel has already met to consider the merits of the deal. The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on the issue on May 8.

With an eye on the big bucks such shows can command, Microsoft will trot out a soccer reality show called “Every Street United.” Sony Corp’s digital network Crackle will serve up Jerry Seinfeld’s “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New Yorkers called “Connected.” This is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long “NewFronts” event - modeled after the annual “upfronts” where broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison Avenue. Yahoo Inc is also looking for longer original programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the deals have yet to be finalized. Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo’s earnings call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more focused investments in original content. “We are going to see more original content overall and no doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV because they have their eyes on TV dollars,” said Kris Magel, chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying division of Interpublic Group of Cos. But TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online video commercials that usually run before and during a program, advertisers and analysts said. “Online video just doesn’t offer nearly the reach that broadcast does,” said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. AOL has spent about half a billion dollars over the last three years on shorter content. On Wednesday, it also inked a deal with Miramax to stream the independent studio’s films on the AOL network for free, but with ads. “Internet companies are bucketed into the snackable short form space,” Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video, said. “But we are seeing the growth in the consumption of content on big screens.” At the NewFronts, which starts on April 28, Microsoft will show longer original shows produced by the company’s Xbox Entertainment Studios that exploit the Internet’s strengths. “The challenge TV has is it’s not very effective in being able to reach a very discrete target audience and measure it and have more interactive components,” said Scott Ferris, general manager of TV and video advertising for Microsoft. “We have very engaged, high-quality audiences.” Online series can get messages in front of people who watch little TV, said Peter Naylor, senior vice president of sales for Hulu.com. The website, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and 21st Century Fox, will also pitch shows to advertisers next week. “There is a segment of the video universe that is very, very hard to reach through traditional television,” Naylor said. “Online video is a way to reach those light TV viewers.” But because online viewers have to search for content, advertisers may end up paying more to reach them than on TV. The cost per thousand (CPM) for a commercial on a cable network, for example, might be between $10 to $30, depending on the show and the demographic, estimates Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. For online video, a CPM for a comparable demographic could be in the range of $20 to $40. “There is a lot of aspiration in the NewFronts initiatives,” said Wieser. “The reality is traditional TV budgets are intended for content vehicles that are TV-like. (Content) with short term, low budgets with unknown or even known talent is unlikely to capture anything resembling a meaningful TV budget.” Another hurdle is that the money that presenters make from the NewFronts is not tracked by the Interactive Advertising Bureau which hosts the event. Ari Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry’s annual showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue online. However, it may take some time before online shows become mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars. Until then, the NewFronts “is more of a showcase for what’s new and exciting,” Bluman said.

621,CMCSA,Univision says Comcast buy of TWC could be 'bad for Hispanic audiences',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Spanish-language television network Univision [UVN.UL] said on Monday that Comcast Corp’s plan to buy rival Time Warner Cable Inc could be “bad for Hispanic audiences.” Univision President Randy Falco said on a conference call with media analysts that the proposed $45 billion deal, which would bring together the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable providers, was a “cause for concern.” “We are hoping at the very least there is that scrutiny and potentially much tougher restrictions added to the existing consent decree (prompted by a 2011 deal) that will protect Comcast competitors such as Univision who are serving minority communities in particular,” said Falco. Falco stopped short of asking the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission, which are reviewing the deal to ensure it is legal, to block it outright.   On the call, Falco said a primary worry was that Comcast, with its range of movies, television shows and sports shows, would be reluctant to carry networks that it did not own, such as Univision.  In particular, he complained that Comcast balked at distributing Univision’s sports network while others, including Time Warner Cable, did carry it.  Falco noted also that if the Comcast/Time Warner Cable deal is approved, the new, larger Comcast would serve 91 percent of all Hispanic households and be the top distributor in 19 of the top 20 Hispanic markets. Also Monday, Comcast announced a deal with Charter Communications Inc as part of Comcast’s efforts to win regulatory approval for its mega merger. If finalized, that agreement would leave Comcast with less than 30 percent of the U.S. residential cable or satellite TV market, a step aimed at pleasing regulators. Charter would have about 6 percent of the pay-TV market, with an eventual shot at climbing to 9 percent. That deal is contingent on Comcast closing the Time Warner Cable acquisition.

628,CMCSA,Fitch Affirms Comcast's IDR at 'A-' Following Asset Divestiture,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) assigned to Comcast Corporation (Comcast) and its wholly owned  subsidiaries included in Comcast's cross-guaranty structure. Fitch has also  affirmed the 'A-' IDR assigned to NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. (Enterprise).  The Rating Outlook on all of these ratings remains Stable.   Approximately $48.1 billion of Comcast's consolidated debt and preferred stock,  including $11.2 billion outstanding at NBCUniversal Media, LLC (NBCUniversal  Media) as of March 31, 2014, is affected by Fitch's action. Fitch's action follows the company's announcement that it has entered into a  series of agreements with Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter) whereby Comcast  will divest approximately 3.9 million video subscribers following the closing of  the Comcast and Time Warner Cable, Inc. (TWC) merger.  The divestiture  transaction is expected to enhance Comcast's ability to secure required  regulatory approval in connection with its pending merger agreement with TWC.  The Charter agreements consist of three separate transactions including: (1) an  asset sale transaction, (2) a contribution and spin-off transaction, and (3) an  asset exchange transaction.  These transactions are subject to several closing  conditions including closing the previously announced merger agreement between  Comcast and TWC and the receipt of required regulatory and shareholder  approvals.  Comcast anticipates the merger with TWC will close by the end of  2014 and that the transactions with Charter and the spin-off transaction will be  reviewed in parallel by the FCC and Department of Justice.    KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch expects the asset divestiture transactions will not have a material  impact on Comcast's operating profile pro forma for the TWC merger and will be  executed in a leverage-neutral manner.  --Proceeds from the asset divestitures will total approximately $14 billion.   Fitch expects Comcast to use the proceeds to reduce outstanding debt and to  repurchase shares of its common stock.   --The transactions should lead to an improved subscriber clustering profile  enabling the company to deliver improved technology deployments, greater  operating efficiencies, and enhanced customer service. --Comcast's merger with TWC remains strategically sound after considering the  asset divestitures, creates significant opportunity to realize operating and  capital spending efficiencies with minimal execution risk and enables the  combined entity to effectively compete on a national scale for incremental  commercial segment business. Fitch remains confident that Comcast can deliver  operating efficiencies of $1.5 billion through its merger with TWC.   --Comcast's capital structure and financial strategy remain intact and centered  on reducing leverage to its target of between 1.5x and 2.0x.  --Fitch does not expect any material change to Comcast's capital allocation  strategy over the near term and believes there is sufficient capacity within the  ratings to accommodate a contemplated expansion of Comcast's share repurchase  authorization.    Fitch continues to believe that Comcast's leverage as of year-end 2014 pro forma  for the TWC merger and the asset divestitures will approximate 2.2x, unchanged  from previous expectations, and approach 2x by the end of 2015 in the absence of  significant cost or operating synergies.  The cable systems to be divested  generate approximately $3 billion of EBITDA.  The loss of EBITDA generation will  be offset with approximately $9 billion of debt reduction.   Fitch's expectation that shareholder returns as a percentage of pre-dividend  cash flow will increase over the medium term is incorporated into the ratings.   Comcast previously indicated that share repurchases should total $5.5 billion  during 2014 including $3 billion within its current plan and an additional $2.5  billion when shareholder approval of the TWC merger is obtained.  Furthermore,  the company expects to expand the share repurchase authorization by an  additional $10 billion upon closing of the merger with TWC.  The asset  divestment transactions create additional capacity for share repurchase  activity. The pending merger with TWC enables Comcast to extend its operating strategies  and technology roadmap into TWC's operations, creating the opportunity to  realize material operating cost and capital spending efficiencies.  Fitch points  out that Comcast's cable-segment EBITDA margin was nearly 500 basis points  higher than the comparable TWC EBITDA margin during the year ended 2013.   Comcast's ability to successfully establish its key operating strategies within  TWC's legacy operations creates the potential for a significant EBITDA benefit  for the combined entity.  Additionally, the national scope of the combined  entity's cable infrastructure will position the company to effectively compete  for a higher tier commercial business.         Comcast's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility are strong based  on Fitch's expectation that the company will continue to generate material  amounts of free cash flow (FCF). Fitch acknowledges that Comcast's share  repurchase program represents a significant use of cash; however, Fitch believes  that the company would reduce the level of share repurchases should the  operating environment materially change, in order to maximize financial  flexibility. Comcast's liquidity position is further supported by cash on hand  (which totaled $3.1 billion on a consolidated basis as of March 31, 2014) and  $6.3 billion of collective available borrowing capacity (as of March 31, 2014)  from Comcast's two revolving credit facilities. Commitments under Comcast's  $6.25 billion revolver will expire June 2017 while the commitments related to  Enterprise's $1.35 billion revolver expire March 2018.  Comcast's debt maturity profile is well-laddered and within Fitch's FCF  expectation. Maturities total approximately $1.9 billion during 2014 (including  $900 million at NBCUniversal Media) excluding outstanding commercial paper,  followed by $3.4 billion during 2015. Comcast's ratings reflect its strong competitive position as one of the largest  video, high-speed Internet and phone providers to residential and business  customers in the U.S. and the company's compelling subscriber clustering  profile. NBCUniversal's portfolio of leading cable networks as well as the  growing importance of its theme parks business are key considerations supporting  Fitch's ratings and a strength of the company's credit profile. Outside of a change to Comcast's financial strategy or additional event-driven  M&A; activity, rating concerns center on Comcast's ability to adapt to the  evolving operating environment while maintaining its relatively competitive  position, given the challenging competitive environment and soft housing and  employment trends. Considering the mature nature of video services and growing  penetration of high-speed data services, Comcast's ability to grow consumer  revenues while maintaining operating margins remains a key rating consideration. RATING SENSITIVITIES: --A positive rating action would likely coincide with Comcast achieving and  committing to a financial policy consistent with an 'A' rating, including  maintaining its leverage below 1.5x on a sustained basis. Comcast would need to  demonstrate that its operating profile will not materially decline in the face  of competition and less than robust housing and employment conditions.  --Negative rating actions would likely coincide with discretionary actions of  Comcast's management including, but not limited to, the company adopting a more  aggressive financial strategy, or additional event-driven merger and acquisition  activity, that drive leverage beyond 2.5x in the absence of a credible  deleveraging plan.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Comcast Corporation --IDR at 'A-';  --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial Paper at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --$6.25 billion revolving bank facility (co-borrower with Comcast Cable  Communications LLC) at 'A-'.

631,CMCSA,Univision says Comcast buy of TWC could be 'bad for Hispanic audiences',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Spanish-language television network Univision said on Monday that Comcast Corp’s plan to buy rival Time Warner Cable Inc could be “bad for Hispanic audiences.” Univision President Randy Falco said on a conference call with media analysts that the proposed $45 billion deal, which would bring together the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable providers, was a “cause for concern.” “We are hoping at the very least there is that scrutiny and potentially much tougher restrictions added to the existing consent decree (prompted by a 2011 deal) that will protect Comcast competitors such as Univision who are serving minority communities in particular,” said Falco. Falco stopped short of asking the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission, which are reviewing the deal to ensure it is legal, to block it outright. On the call, Falco said a primary worry was that Comcast, with its range of movies, television shows and sports shows, would be reluctant to carry networks that it did not own, such as Univision. In particular, he complained that Comcast balked at distributing Univision’s sports network, while others, including Time Warner Cable, did carry it. Falco noted also that if the Comcast/Time Warner Cable deal is approved, the new, larger Comcast would serve 91 percent of all Hispanic households and be the top distributor in 19 of the top 20 Hispanic markets. Comcast said in response it “has had an extraordinary, long-standing commitment to Hispanic programming and through the transaction with Time Warner Cable, we are committed to bringing high-quality Hispanic content to millions of additional Americans.” “This transaction will not lead to any reduction in competition or consumer choice in any market because Comcast and Time Warner Cable serve separate and distinct geographic areas,” the company’s statement added. “We will not have undue power in negotiating with programming networks, and we have a great record of working with programmers from the largest to the smallest.” Also on Monday, Comcast announced a deal with Charter Communications Inc as part of Comcast’s efforts to win regulatory approval for its mega merger. If finalized, that agreement would leave Comcast with less than 30 percent of the U.S. residential cable or satellite TV market, a step aimed at pleasing regulators. Charter would have about 6 percent of the pay-TV market, with an eventual shot at climbing to 9 percent. That deal is contingent on Comcast closing the Time Warner Cable acquisition.

635,CMCSA,Singer Gwen Stefani joins judges panel on NBC's 'The Voice',"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Singer Gwen Stefani will be sitting alongside fellow star musicians Pharrell Williams, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton in the forthcoming season of NBC’s singing talent competition “The Voice,” the Comcast Corp-owned network said on Tuesday. Stefani, 44, who rose to fame as the blonde-haired sultry lead singer of Southern California rock group No Doubt, will join Pharrell in taking over from current judges, Colombian singer Shakira and R&B; star Usher.   NBC also said that Christina Aguilera, one of the show’s original four celebrity coaches, will return for the eighth season next year. She took a hiatus from “The Voice” after season five, and is expecting a child. The Emmy-winning show has outpaced competition from Fox’s reality singing contest “American Idol,” averaging about 13.8 million viewers per episode this season, trumping “Idol” by about 3 million viewers per episode.  The show’s celebrity panel of judges led by Aguilera, Maroon 5 frontman Levine and country music star Shelton, has been credited with helping it draw viewers. “The Voice” is also considered a coveted spot to promote songs, such as Maroon 5 and Aguilera’s “Moves Like Jagger” that became a hit in 2011, after the singers performed it on the show.  Grammy-winning Stefani is best known for No Doubt hits including “Don’t Speak” and “Hey Baby,” and her solo career with songs such as “Hollaback Girl.” The singer, who also has a successful clothing line, L.A.M.B., is returning to the spotlight after the birth of her third child. She will join fellow “Voice” newcomer Pharrell to perform on the show’s telecast next week, each performing their latest hits.

637,CMCSA,Exclusive - Comcast nears deal to stream EA games to TVs: sources,"LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Comcast Corp may soon allow customers using its cloud-connected X1 cable box system to buy games from Electronic Arts Inc through their televisions, according to five sources briefed on the plans. Such a partnership would come as the cable company seeks to protect its turf against a new wave of challengers. After two years of testing, Comcast and EA, are close to reaching an agreement to stream video games such as “FIFA” and “Madden,” into the living rooms of some of Comcast’s more-than 22 million customers across the United States, said the sources, who declined to speak publicly before a deal had been struck. Comcast would make the games available on X1, a video operating system with apps and an interface that is considered the most sophisticated in the cable industry, the sources said. It features Internet applications, viewing recommendations and voice control. If the agreement goes through, it would mark the boldest step yet by a cable company to muscle into the territory of leading video-game console manufacturers such as Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp. Comcast has been beefing its x1 system with new features to stop potential customer defections to rival video streaming systems such as Apple TV and Amazon.com Inc’s FireTV, which was launched just last month with a slew of games. Apple TV allows users to stream games from their iOS phones and tablets to TV sets, and developers expect Apple to bring gaming directly to its streaming box. FireTV was released with over 100 free and paid games from the likes of Disney and Electronic Arts. Comcast and EA’s aim is to make buying games as easy as ordering a pay-per-view movie, sources said. This could create a new distribution model that circumvents console and video-streaming device makers. EA and Comcast, which is awaiting regulatory approval for its $45 billion proposal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, declined to comment. The TWC deal, which would make Comcast the country’s largest cable provider, highlights Comcast’s desire to thwart the fresh challenge from the video and entertainment upstarts. For Electronic Arts, a deal with Comcast could represent an important new revenue opportunity. The video game industry has yet to see a sustained recovery in sagging software sales despite robust hardware sales driven by the November launches of Microsoft’s Xbox One and Sony’s PlayStation 4 consoles. In January, Redwood City, California-based EA lowered its 2015 revenue forecast - prompted by the sooner-than-expected drop in sales of games for older consoles after the release of the new devices. Under the agreement now being hashed out with Electronic Arts, Comcast will offer action, sports and casual titles from EA’s portfolio, including potential titles such as “FIFA,” “Madden,” “Monopoly” and “Plants vs. Zombies,” the people said. The game offerings have not been finalized. Customers will be able to turn their tablets into controllers to play the games. Revenue share terms and the exact release date have not been decided. Comcast has been bulking up the capabilities of its X1 service, which can store content on the cloud, and experimenting with new ways to reach viewers. Last fall, it started selling movies for download and streaming through its set-top boxes and XFINITY TV website, which created a new path for Hollywood studios to generate revenue from films after their theater run ends. While Comcast added video subscribers for the past two quarters, after years of losses, it is facing increasing competition for viewership, both online and through streaming boxes. The Xbox and PlayStation, for instance, are now marketed as living room entertainment hubs that offer more than just games. Microsoft and Sony have added media features to their consoles over the past two years like original programming, online video and TV apps — including Comcast’s XFINITY on-demand service. But cable companies so far have not been able to load their set-top boxes with the technology to support gaming. Comcast will focus on casual and family games at first and consider offering other first-person shooter and action games later based on user preferences, the sources told Reuters.

638,CMCSA,"Comcast to bring its X1 service to L.A., New York within year of merger","Los Angeles (Reuters) - Within a year after its $45 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N closes, Comcast Corp aims to make its advanced X1 cable service available in areas such as New York and Los Angeles and other markets where it will gain a commanding new presence. “We’ll be within the first markets in a year,” Neil Smit, president and chief executive of Comcast’s cable unit, told Reuters. The new technology would “bring considerably higher Internet speeds to Time Warner Cable customers” in those cities, Smit said, and give them access to such X1 services as Internet applications, viewing recommendations and voice control. Features offered by the cloud-connected X1 cable box system could help Comcast pick up subscribers in major cities where Time Warner Cable’s growth has stalled in recent years. Gaining entry to the New York and Los Angeles markets was part of the strategic rationale behind Comcast’s offer to buy TWC. In Los Angeles, satellite operators have emerged as big providers of pay television services, while in New York, Verizon’s video services has taken significant market share. Time Warner Cable’s new advanced cable boxes should be capable of running Comcast’s X1 operating system, Smit said in a recent interview at a cable industry show in Los Angeles, making the transition easier. Comcast is waiting for regulatory approval of the Time Warner Cable deal. To that end, it announced last week it would divest 3.9 million subscribers to Charter, a complicated deal under which Comcast will trade some of its cable systems to Charter. The TWC and Charter deals would leave Comcast a strong presence on both the East and West coasts and Texas. Smit was unable to say how much the upgrades and rollout will cost. He said the timing can still change, depending on the state of the acquired systems, which Comcast has not been able to assess in depth. “Basically you want to enable enough data to pass through the network to deliver to the needs of the customer whether it’s television channels or broadband,” he said.

640,CMCSA,"RPT-Comcast to bring its X1 service to L.A., New York within year of merger","Los Angeles, May 4 (Reuters) - Within a year after its $45 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc closes, Comcast Corp aims to make its advanced X1 cable service available in areas such as New York and Los Angeles and other markets where it will gain a commanding new presence. “We’ll be within the first markets in a year,” Neil Smit, president and chief executive of Comcast’s cable unit, told Reuters. The new technology would “bring considerably higher Internet speeds to Time Warner Cable customers” in those cities, Smit said, and give them access to such X1 services as Internet applications, viewing recommendations and voice control. Features offered by the cloud-connected X1 cable box system  could help Comcast pick up subscribers in major cities where Time Warner Cable’s growth has stalled in recent years. Gaining entry to the New York and Los Angeles markets was part of the strategic rationale behind Comcast’s offer to buy TWC. In Los Angeles, satellite operators have emerged as big providers of pay television services, while in New York, Verizon’s video services has taken significant market share. Time Warner Cable’s new advanced cable boxes should be capable of running Comcast’s X1 operating system, Smit said in a recent interview at a cable industry show in Los Angeles, making the transition easier. Comcast is waiting for regulatory approval of the Time Warner Cable deal. To that end, it announced last week it would divest 3.9 million subscribers to Charter, a complicated deal under which Comcast will trade some of its cable systems to Charter. The TWC and Charter deals would leave Comcast a strong presence on both the East and West coasts and Texas. Smit was unable to say how much the upgrades and rollout will cost. He said the timing can still change, depending on the state of the acquired systems, which Comcast has not been able to assess in depth. “Basically you want to enable enough data to pass through the network to deliver to the needs of the customer whether it’s television channels or broadband,” he said. Time Warner Cable has already been upgrading its capabilities in several high-priority markets, such as Los Angeles and New York, which will accelerate the rollout, Smit said.

641,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-NBC makes surprise play to sign Olympics TV rights through 2032,"(Adds contract details, rival media companies and media analyst comment) By Liana B. Baker May 7 (Reuters) - NBC Universal, the media unit of cable operator Comcast Corp, is paying $7.65 billion for the rights to six Olympic Games, surprising competitors by keeping its grip on the valuable live sports event for the next two decades. The agreement, announced on Wednesday in a joint statement with the International Olympic Committee, includes media rights across broadcast television, cable TV, internet and mobile platforms, and extends NBC’s previous contract by 11 years. NBC sealed the exclusive deal to broadcast three winter games and three summer games from 2022 to 2032 before any other media companies could even bid. The IOC did not approach ESPN, a network spokesman said, and neither were Fox nor CBS. NBC and rival networks have been stocking up on live sports content, which are popular with advertisers because large audiences watch in real-time and do not skip the TV commercials. “It was a smart preemptive move to get control of the situation early,” said Steve Ridge, media strategy group president at the consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates, who added that advertising demand for the Olympics remains strong. IOC president Thomas Bach said the organization wanted to build a long-term partnership with NBC, which also made the financial commitment. The IOC “did not see any reason to take any risk” by talking to other networks, Bach said. The host cities of the six Olympic Games have not been selected yet. The next Olympics to be decided is expected to be announced in 2015 for the winter games of 2022. The United States has not had an Olympics since the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games and could be back in the running to host the Summer Games of 2024 because interest is gaining momentum at home and among IOC members. Comcast, which clinched full control of NBC Universal last year, used the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, as a spring board to promote its prime time lineup and boost viewership of its cable networks. Live streaming online options of Olympic events from the games in Sochi also attracted tens of millions of dollars in advertising. Macquarie analyst Amy Yong estimates that Comcast paid 20 percent more for each contest than it did on its last contract, which she said was is in line with other sports media deals. The Olympics haven’t always scored for NBC. The unit lost $223 million at the Vancouver Winter Games in 2010, according to General Electric, which owned NBC at the time. Olympics with prime time live events usually have better ratings. NBC agreed in 2011 to spend $4.38 billion on the U.S. broadcasting rights for four Olympic games until 2020 when the games are in Tokyo. After that deal was announced, NBC executives had said the network should reap a profit from that contract. NBC added on Wednesday that it had to agreed pay an extra $100 million signing bonus to promote the Olympics brand for five years beginning in 2015.

643,CMCSA,"Dish Network says cannot afford to bid against rivals for DirecTV, T-Mobile","(Reuters) - Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) Chairman Charlie Ergen said on Thursday he wanted to avoid pricy bidding wars with deep-pocketed rivals for targets such as T-Mobile and DirecTV, even if they could help the satellite television operator. Merger speculation in the pay-TV and telecommunications industries has heated up in the past few months, with Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and DirecTV’s DTV.O reported talks with AT&T; about a sale. Sprint Corp (S.N), controlled by Softbank Corp’s (9984.T) Masayoshi Son, has also made no secret of its interest in T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N, which some bankers have floated as a potential target for Dish as well. When asked on a conference call about Dish’s merger options, Ergen said the company, which attempted to buy DirecTV more than a decade ago, would not make a new approach at its current price, even though a tie-up would provide lots of synergies. “(DirecTV) looks to be too frothy, but it could make a lot of sense for an AT&T; or Verizon, or somebody else who has a different motivation,” he said. Shares of Dish and DirecTV each closed 4 percent lower on Thursday following the comments. Unlike DirecTV, Dish has amassed billions in wireless airwaves over the past few years under Ergen. He may have suffered a setback on one of his wireless investments on Thursday, when a U.S. bankruptcy judge ruled that his $1 billion debt in the LightSquared bankruptcy should be subordinated and questioned Ergen’s credibility. Ergen said Dish was not in a position to outbid Sprint should it make a move for smaller rival T-Mobile but if Sprint does not proceed, T-Mobile, which is majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) would be of “strategic interest” to Dish. Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Officer Tim Hoettges reiterated on Thursday he would be in favor of building a stronger third player in the U.S. market through a merger, but said U.S. regulators don’t appear to want one. As the U.S. pay-TV market matures, Dish has been developing an Internet-based TV product and has reached a programming agreement with Disney and is in talks with other media companies. The upcoming service is being closely watched because it would mark the first time a big operator unveiled a purely web-based service outside of a traditional TV subscription. “We have enough programming contracts to launch this service now, but we don’t anticipate we would launch before the end of the year,” Ergen said.

645,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-U.S. lawmakers air concerns over Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal,"(Adds lawmaker pressure to show more rural programming) By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - Lawmakers expressed concern about combining the top two U.S. cable operators at a congressional hearing Thursday to discuss  Comcast’s  plan to merge with Time Warner Cable Inc. While none of the lawmakers asked regulators to block the transaction, both Republicans and Democrats cautioned there were potential negatives in the $45 billion deal. Representative Blake Farenthold, a Texas Republican, worried that small programmers may not be able to sell video to cable operators. “I don’t want to sound hostile to this merger,” he said, but noted constituents and interest groups have raised concerns. Representative John Conyers, a Democratic critic of big mergers in general, said a combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable would have 30 percent of the cable market, at least 40 percent of the broadband market, 19 of the 20 biggest cable markets and a major Spanish-language channel, as well as movies and television shows and sports programming. “Comcast is a cable company and a programmer. That raises a double concern with me,” said Conyers. “I don’t know if it’s resolvable.” Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen tried to allay the concerns. “This transaction has the potential to slow the increase in prices. ... Consumers are going to be the big winners,” he told a hearing of the House of Representatives’ antitrust panel. A trio of lawmakers pressed Cohen on why the company decided to reduce the number of areas where it showed programming from Rural Media Group, whose founder, Patrick Gottsch, testified. Representative Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, said: “A lot of people who move from the farm to the urban area still want to be connected to the farm.” Cohen said the decision was made because of a shortage of bandwidth, and was not necessarily permanent. “We carry 160 independent programming networks,” he said. “We’re a company that really tries to find the niches of programming that customers in particular markets are interested in.” Comcast faced tough criticism from Dave Schaeffer, CEO of Cogent Communications Group Inc, which has been a high-speed go-between for Netflix Inc and Comcast. In February, Netflix agreed to pay Comcast to connect directly. Schaeffer said that, after years of free connections, Comcast demanded Cogent pay to remedy Netflix’s balky speed. Schaeffer said Cogent offered to pay some hardware costs, but that Comcast had remained silent and no agreement was reached. “That’s not a free market. That’s an abuse of market power,” he said. Cohen disagreed. “We did not force Netflix to enter into an interconnection deal with us. That was Netflix’ idea,” he said, noting that the company said it wanted to “cut out the middleman.” Cohen said he could not disclose the terms of the deal but added, “It has been publicly reported that Netflix is paying not more to us under this agreement, but less (than they paid Cogent).” Netflix has been critical of the agreement it made, with one executive calling it “double-dipping” since Comcast customers and Netflix both pay to have the movies and TV shows delivered to living rooms. The American Cable Association’s Matthew Polka also worried about video programming and urged the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission, which must review the deal, to ensure Comcast does not raise prices or withhold shows from smaller rivals. Comcast said on April 28 that it was willing to divest nearly 4 million subscribers to win approval for the deal. That would leave it with 29 million subscribers if the deal goes through.

647,CMCSA,RPT-Comcast to face trio of critics at congressional merger hearing,"(Repeats story released earlier on Thursday with no changes) By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - Comcast’s plan to merge with Time Warner Cable Inc is expected to face criticism from an independent network, small and medium-sized cable operators and a former Internet partner when U.S. lawmakers meet on Thursday for a second time to discuss the controversial deal. The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel will hear from Comcast Corp Executive Vice President David Cohen. The company argues its proposed $45 billion deal to merge the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable operators would not hurt consumers since the companies overlap geographically in very few places. Among the critics due to testify is Dave Schaeffer, CEO of Cogent Communications Group Inc, which has been a high-speed go-between for Netflix and Comcast. In February, Netflix Inc agreed to pay Comcast an unknown sum to connect directly. Shaeffer said in prepared testimony that, after years of free connections “Comcast demanded that Cogent enter into a commercial relationship” to remedy Netflix’s balky speed. Shaeffer said Cogent offered to pay for some hardware costs, but that Comcast had remained silent. In Comcast’s prepared testimony, Cohen argued that Netflix chose the option of a direct connection and that such deals are neither novel nor unusual. Netflix has been critical of the agreement it made, with one executive calling it “double-dipping” since Comcast customers and Netflix both pay to have the movies and television shows delivered to living rooms. A second critic of the merger to testify will be Patrick Gottsch, founder of Rural Media Group, whose RFD-TV channel provides programs aimed at farmers and about rural living. Gottsch complained that, after Comcast bought NBC Universal in 2011, it dropped some television channels. “Because there is no clear business reason to understand Comcast’s decision, we can only speculate that RFD-TV has become competitive with Comcast’s affiliated programming,” Gottsch wrote in his testimony. The American Cable Association’s Matthew Polka also worried about video programming and urged the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission, which must review the deal, to ensure Comcast does not raise prices or withhold shows from smaller rivals. Comcast said on April 28 that it was willing to divest nearly four million subscribers to win approval for the deal. That will leave Comcast with 29 million subscribers if the deal goes through.

652,CMCSA,WWE shares slammed as NBC Universal TV deal fails to impress,"(Reuters) - World Wrestling Entertainment Inc (WWE.N) lost almost half its market value on Friday as its new cable deal with Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBCUniversal failed to convince investors it had achieved its desired revenue increase from TV deals. Shares of WWE, which produces “Monday Night Raw” and “Friday Night SmackDown,” fell as much as 47 percent before trading 43 percent lower at $11.29 at mid-afternoon. Asked about the selloff, Chief Strategy and Financial Officer George Barrios said in an interview that investors have a “different perspective on how they were thinking about the opportunity in WWE and we have to let that shake itself out.” WWE said on Thursday it had entered into a multi-year licensing partnership with NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment for its flagship shows for an undisclosed sum. All its TV deals, including renewals in the United States, United Kingdom and Thailand have increased TV revenue by $90 million to an average value of $200 million per year, it said in a statement. Analysts said on Friday the company had been too upbeat about the opportunity to increase the rights fees it stood to gain from its U.S. TV deal. “Given management’s more optimistic tone and the fact that other major sports franchises have garnered much higher increases, this outcome is likely to be viewed as disappointing,” said CJS Securities analyst Daniel Moor in a research note. On December 10 at a UBS conference Barrios compared Nascar’s $820 million annual deal with FOX (FOXA.O) and NBC, with the roughly $100 million WWE got at the time, citing a “massive opportunity” to close that gap. Since those comments were made until Friday’s selloff, WWE shares had gained 37 percent. Barrios said he did not think his comments were too upbeat. “We never said specifically what we thought we’d get. What we did say is, look, the market is really valuing live content and we think we should be worth more, and we were right. We were worth more,” he said, pointing to how WWE secured an overall increase in revenue from all of its TV deals combined. WWE also made a big bet this year on a TV streaming product which costs subscribers $9.99 a month. As of April 6, the company had 667,000 subscribers. Barrios said the company’s research shows that 2 million to 2.5 million people could sign up. PAA Research analyst Brad Safalow said WWE could spend $25 million to $60 million to support the streaming service in 2015 and that investors are questioning when it would become profitable. WWE has forecast a net loss of $45 million to $52 million for 2014.

654,CMCSA,UPDATE 3-'Godzilla' tramples rivals with monster $93 mln debut,"(Adds details on possible sequel paragraphs 1, 10) By Lisa Richwine and Chris Michaud LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - “Godzilla,” a remake of the classic Japanese monster movie, crushed its box office competitors over the weekend, devouring $93.2 million in the United States and Canada for the year’s second-biggest debut and spawning talk of a sequel. The smashing performance makes the film a hit for Legendary Pictures, the independent studio headed by Thomas Tull that financed 75 percent of the $160 million production, and its partner Warner Bros., which said the new take on “Godzilla” was on its way to becoming a franchise. The giant lizard trounced second-place finisher, Seth Rogen comedy “Neighbors,” which led sales a week ago and earned $26 million from Friday through Sunday, ahead of superhero sequel “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” with $16.8 million, according to estimates from tracking firm Rentrak. “Godzilla” added $103 million in international markets where it opened on Wednesday for a global total of $195 million, said Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc. The movie is the latest Hollywood remake of the 1954 Japanese film about a mutant monster created when U.S. nuclear weapons testing goes awry. The new film stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a naval officer who battles the rampaging beast from Hawaii to San Francisco. “Godzilla” roared past industry forecasts which called for an opening of about $70 million. Its $93.2 million nipped at April’s $95 million debut for “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.” Dan Fellman, president of domestic distribution for Warner Bros., said the film played well in all markets, which boded well for more Godzilla films. “We have a franchise in the making, and we’re looking at sequels as we speak,” Fellman said. Legendary controls the rights to future “Godzilla” installments. Warner Bros. has an option to co-finance any sequels and distribute them, according to a source with knowledge of the arrangement. Legendary Pictures’s President Jon Jashni said female and more mature audiences boosted the film’s fortunes. “Those who thought a Godzilla movie might not necessarily be for them ... and that feeds on itself,” he said. Legendary is one of Hollywood’s most prolific producers of big-budget films, among them director Christopher Nolan’s two “Dark Knight” installments, which the studio made with Warner Bros. Last year, Legendary reached a five-year agreement to produce films for Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures. “The Amazing Spider-Man 2,” starring Andrew Garfield, brought worldwide sales to $633 million through Sunday, said distributor Sony Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp. New Walt Disney Co movie “Million Dollar Arm” debuted in fourth place with $10.5 million. “Mad Men” star Jon Hamm plays a real-life sports agent who seeks to turn Indian cricket players into U.S. baseball stars in the $25 million film. Comedy “The Other Woman” earned $6.3 million for fifth place. It was released by 20th Century Fox, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox.

655,CMCSA,U.S. should reject Comcast-TWC merger - NY Times editorial,"WASHINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators should challenge the proposed $45 billion merger of the two largest American cable providers, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc, the New York Times said in an editorial in Tuesday’s newspaper. The editorial, headlined “A Cable Merger Too Far,” said there were good reasons for the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission to block the proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable by Comcast. The Times cited limited competition in the high-speed Internet market and Comcast’s negotiating power with Web content companies and TV programmers. “The merger will concentrate too much market power in the hands of one company, creating a telecommunications colossus the likes of which the country has not seen since 1984 when the government forced the breakup of the original AT&T; telephone monopoly,” the editorial said. “By buying Time Warner Cable, Comcast would become a gatekeeper over what consumers watch, read and listen to.” The Federal Communications Commission is reviewing whether the merger is in the public interest, and the Justice Department will decide whether it complies with antitrust law. Public interest groups and some legislators have opposed the combination. Comcast has argued that its business faces powerful competitors like Google Inc or wireless carriers like AT&T; Inc, and has stressed that Comcast and Time Warner Cable do not directly compete in any market. AT&T;, the No. 2 wireless carrier, has proposed buying the largest U.S. satellite TV company, DirecTV, for $48.5 billion, which the Times said only increased concerns about Internet and TV market consolidation. A Washington Post editorial in April said regulators should approve the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, but with conditions. However, the Times said conditions, such as requiring the merged company not to give favored treatment to established content providers like Netflix, may not be enough. “ ... This merger would fundamentally change the structure of this important industry and give one company too much control over what information, shows, movies and sports Americans can access on TVs and the Internet,” the newspaper said. “Federal regulators should challenge this deal.” To read the editorial, click here: nyti.ms/1myB1Pi   (Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)",5272014,http://www.reuters.com/article/comcast-timewarnercable-newyorktimes/u-s-should-reject-comcast-twc-merger-ny-times-editorial-idUSL1N0OD0JB20140527
656,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-Fox TV network chief to depart after ratings slump,"(Recasts with ratings figures and background on programming) By Eric Kelsey LOS ANGELES, May 29 (Reuters) - Kevin Reilly, the top executive at Fox broadcast television, is leaving the network next month, the company said on Thursday, after Fox slumped to last place in ratings among the big U.S. broadcasters. Reilly’s seven years as chairman of entertainment at Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s broadcast division ended with marquee programs like “American Idol” and “Glee” suffering sharp ratings drops. Fox has also lost its top ranking among viewers in the 18-49 age group that advertisers value most. Reilly said in a statement that he and Fox Networks Group chairman and chief executive officer, Peter Rice, had been discussing his departure for a while. “It felt like the timing was as right as it could be,” Reilly, who joined Fox in 2007 and was named chairman of entertainment in 2012, said in the statement. The move comes after the network presented its fall stable of programming to advertisers earlier this month. Fox said that Reilly’s senior executives will report to Rice before the company names a replacement. The network averaged 7.3 million in daily primetime viewers this past season, according to Nielsen data. That was up from 7 million last year, but Fox fell one place to fourth behind, CBS, NBC and ABC, respectively. Its record haul of 111.5 million viewers in February for football’s Super Bowl did not deliver a significant improvement on overall viewership. The Super Bowl also failed to boost the coveted 18-49 audience, which remained flat and in second place with 3.1 million viewers on average. Fox’s current entertainment slate consists of critically acclaimed shows such as “The Mindy Project,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” and “New Girl,” but the shows have so far been unable to become ratings powerhouses for the network. In addition to struggling with falling audiences for  “American Idol” and “Glee,” the network jettisoned Simon Cowell’s singing contest “The X Factor” in February after three seasons. Fox also canceled the anticipated science-fiction drama “Almost Human” from executive producer and “Star Trek” director J.J. Abrams after one season. Fox was the top draw in the 18-49 age group for eight consecutive years before it was knocked to second in the 2012-13 season. NBC, under the ownership of Comcast Corp has managed to make a big comeback and now is the top network in the 18-49 age group. Reilly joined Fox from NBC, where he was the president of entertainment and oversaw the development of shows like hit comedies “The Office” and “30 Rock.” Reilly is also credited with helping usher in the current era of acclaimed and well-rated cable television from his time at Fox’s cable network FX where he introduced drama series such as “Nip/Tuck” and “The Shield.”   (Editing by Mary Milliken and Tom Brown)",5292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/television-fox/update-2-fox-tv-network-chief-to-depart-after-ratings-slump-idUSL1N0OF1SC20140529
657,CMCSA,UPDATE 3-Verizon demands Netflix stop messages on slow streaming,"(Adds context, paragraph 2, changes source in last paragraph to “a Comcast spokeswoman”) By Lisa Richwine and Marina Lopes LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc on Thursday demanded that Netflix Inc  immediately stop displaying messages to customers that place blame on Verizon’s broadband service for slow delivery of Netflix TV shows and movies. The letter is the latest sign of tension between content providers like Netflix and Internet service providers over who should pay the price for companies that stream heavy traffic online. In a cease-and-desist letter sent to Netflix, Verizon also asked the video streaming service to provide information including a list of customers on the Verizon network to whom Netflix delivered the notices, or face legal action. “Failure to provide this information may lead us to pursue legal remedies,” Verizon general counsel Randal Milch said in a letter to Netflix general counsel David Hyman. In mid-May, Netflix started a test of messages displayed on the screen for some customers when a video is buffering. The messages say that there is congestion on the network of Verizon or another Internet service provider. Netflix said on Thursday the test is continuing and meant to provide customers more information about their service, similar to a speed index that Netflix has published for months with a ranking of Internet service providers. “This is about consumers not getting what they paid for from their broadband provider,” Netflix spokesman Jonathan Friedland said. “We are trying to provide more transparency, just like we do with the ISP Speed Index, and Verizon is trying to shut down that discussion.” David Young, Verizon’s vice president of federal regulatory affairs, told Reuters he felt the messages were part of a Netflix agenda to promote its views in Washington. Netflix has been urging the Federal Communications Commission to prevent broadband providers such as Verizon from charging Netflix fees for faster delivery of videos. “That seems to be the motivation, to try to make a point or make points in that discussion that is going on in Washington D.C.,” Young said in a phone interview, though he wouldn’t specify the issues. In the letter, Verizon said the message’s assertions were deceptive and inaccurate and that the responsibility for slow streaming on the site falls on Netflix. Verizon said that in order to save money, Netflix relies on middlemen to distribute its content knowing that some of them have issues with congestion in some networks. In April, Netflix said it reluctantly signed a deal to pay fees to Verizon to bypass those middlemen and deliver content directly to the company, ensuring faster speeds. But Verizon is still working to implement the needed architecture and expects to finish improvements by the end of 2014, said Young. “I sincerely hope this is not a harbinger of things to come in terms of how Netflix treats its partners and our mutual customers,” Milch said in the letter. The Verizon notices came to light this week when a reporter who was a Verizon user tweeted about them. Comcast Corp , which also receives connection fees from Netflix, is not aware of any reports of Netflix buffering messages to its customers, a Comcast spokeswoman said.

658,CMCSA,"Sprint, T-Mobile deal to face fierce U.S. antitrust headwinds","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sprint Corp (S.N) and T-Mobile TMUS.N might have some fresh arguments to allay regulator skepticism about a merger, but the government may still be reluctant to approve shrinking the U.S. wireless market from four main players to three.     Analysts said a decline in shares of both companies on Thursday reflected those high regulatory hurdles. T-Mobile closed 2.3 percent lower and Sprint 4 percent lower.  Sprint, purchased by Japan’s Softbank Corp (9984.T) in 2013, has agreed to pay about $40 per share, or over $32 billion, for T-Mobile US, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, bringing to a head a long-discussed and controversial deal to reshape the U.S. cellphone market.   But top U.S. antitrust and communications enforcers have already warned that the wireless market is too concentrated. In 2011 the Justice Department stopped a bid by AT&T; Inc (T.N), No. 2 in the market, to buy struggling T-Mobile. Top dog Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T; each have roughly twice as many subscribers as either Sprint or T-Mobile, in the third and fourth spots by numbers of subscribers.  Bill Baer, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in January that it would difficult for his agency to approve a big wireless mergers. “It’s going to be hard for someone to make a persuasive case that reducing four firms to three is actually going to improve competition for the benefit of American consumers,” Baer told the New York Times.  Masayoshi Son, CEO of Softbank, trekked to Washington in February to seek the counsel of Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, but got a cool response to a potential merger. Wheeler has not hinted at any softening of that stance. Antitrust experts called the unusually public cautions from Wheeler and Baer a warning. “This is going to be a tough road for them. Tough,” said one expert, who spoke anonymously to protect business relationships. “In the wake of AT&T;/T-Mobile, this deal faces long odds.” The Justice Department noted T-Mobile’s role as a maverick and price-cutter as a reason to stop the earlier deal. That dynamic has not changed, said David Balto, a veteran of the Federal Trade Commission now in private practice.  “There’s a segment of the market which needs to have competition protected, which is the value (discount) segment,” Balto said. “This is where these guys go head to head.”     A third antitrust expert said the companies might have cards yet to play to win approval: “There may be good arguments (for the deal) that we just haven’t seen yet. But ... the odds are heavily against the deal.” SoftBank is likely to argue that the huge pending mergers of Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) with Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and AT&T; with DirecTV DTV.O reinforce the danger of creating a handful of media and telecom giants. That threat was underlined when the FCC in May voted to restrict AT&T; and Verizon in the 2015 auction of highly valued low-frequency airwaves.  But others say approval this year of a merger between US Airways and American Airlines was a sign regulators could be convinced of the merits of a deal that reduces the number of competitors but creates a stronger number three.  “They need a game-changing idea,” said Robert McDowell, a former Republican FCC commissioner.  “There has to be a new proposal in order to shake up the mindset of the Obama administration which has a ‘religious’ conviction against going from four to three national wireless carriers.

663,CMCSA,FCC looking into slow Internet download speeds,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators will review agreements between Netflix, Verizon, Comcast and other content and Internet providers to figure out whether they are causing slow web download speeds for some consumers, especially for streaming video content.  Consumers have complained to the Federal Communications Commission about the ongoing spat between Netflix and Internet service providers (ISPs). Both sides accuse each other of causing a slowdown in Internet speeds by the way they route traffic.  “At the heart of this is whether ISPs that provide connectivity in the final mile to the home can advantage or disadvantage content providers, and therefore advantage or disadvantage consumers,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday.  Large content providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) have historically paid middlemen or ISPs to deliver their content to consumers. The specifics of such agreements, known as “interconnection” and sometimes “peering,” have been secret and outside of the FCC’s regulatory scope. The FCC earlier this year launched a new effort to set rules regulating how broadband providers manage Internet traffic on their networks. Netflix has urged the agency to begin regulating such agreements to do away with fees that content companies pay. Though the FCC has not indicated that it plans to regulate the deals, the agency is now asking multiple Internet service providers and content companies, particularly video service providers, to provide details, Wheeler said. “Consumers need to understand what is occurring when the Internet service they’ve paid for does not adequately deliver the content they desire, especially content they’ve also paid for,” he told reporters after a monthly FCC meeting. “What we are doing right now is collecting information, not regulating. We are looking under the hood. Consumers want transparency. They want answers. And so do I,” he said.  In an earlier statement Wheeler said the commission is “not suggesting that any company is at fault.”  Consumer advocates, who support stricter regulatory oversight of relationships between content and Internet providers, welcomed the step and called on the FCC to make details of those agreements public. It is unclear whether the FCC plans to do so. Analysts pegged the FCC’s move as a win for Netflix, which on Friday welcomed the move toward more transparency. “Americans deserve to get the speed and quality of Internet access they pay for,” Netflix spokesman Joris Evers said in a statement. Netflix earlier this year agreed to pay fees to Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Comcast (CMCSA.O) to bypass middlemen and deliver content directly to the companies’ subscribers, ensuring faster speeds. “Netflix has been paying (for traffic delivery) since inception. It wants free, I get it, but someone has to pay for it,” Jim Cicconi, AT&T; Inc (T.N) senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, said earlier this week. Netflix streaming accounts for nearly one-third of North American web traffic during peak times, according to research by Sandvine Corp. Netflix vice president for global public policy, Christopher Libertelli, this week said the company already invests money in delivering traffic to the Internet provider. “We pay a lot of money to drop content at the doorstep of an ISP. All we’re really asking is for the ISPs to swing the door open,” Libertelli said at the Aspen Institute think tank. “This has become a new choke point.” The FCC has regulated “net neutrality” only on the part of the network that goes from the Internet service providers to the consumer, and has not delved into what happens before that. The agency’s proposed net neutrality rules keep that distinction.  Comcast, Verizon and AT&T; welcomed the FCC’s review on Friday. Internet providers pointed out that traffic exchange fees have long been negotiated through commercial agreements and said they hoped the review would focus on consumers and not a particular business model.

668,CMCSA,Universal to unveil second Harry Potter attraction,"ORLANDO,  Fla., June 17 (Reuters) - Universal Orlando kicks off previews on Wednesday of its much anticipated Diagon Alley, a second Harry Potter-themed attraction that is expected provide a boost for the park’s revenues and for tourism in central Florida. Universal has yet to fix a date for the opening of Diagon Alley this summer, but theme park experts predict a major bump in tourism based on the response to the original, a recreation of Hogsmeade Village, which required staggered entry times long after the June 2010 grand opening to control crowds. “There are heightened expectations for this expansion,” said Richmond-based theme park consultant John Gerner of Leisure Business Advisors. Universal did not respond to inquiries about company attendance expectations. In the month after the original Harry Potter attraction opened, bed tax revenue from hotel guests in Orange County jumped 21 percent over the previous year. “It certainly appeared to be a correlation to the Harry Potter opening,” said Peggy McGarrity, deputy county comptroller, who added that double-digit increases became standard thereafter. Universal and the Harry Potter franchise are being promoted all week on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. The network and resort are both owned by Comcast Corp. “It’s unusual you would have a national show like the Tonight Show to promote this. That’s an indication they are doing everything they can,” Gerner said. Universal is promising a red carpet event to unveil the park on Wednesday night with some of the film’s stars but is not saying which ones. Diagon Alley recreates the wizarding business district in London described in J. K. Rowling’s book and movie series. The attraction will be geared in large part toward eateries and souvenir shops, both of which have been bottlenecks in the Hogsmeade Village, home to the wizard school Hogwarts. Gerner said popular themed attractions can double their ticket price revenue from in-park sales. To visit both sections of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, guests will have to buy a more expensive two-park pass because Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley were built in separate Universal parks. The attractions are connected by a train featured in books and movies which is a themed ride in itself. Gerner said this is the first time a resort has found a way to seamlessly connect two separately ticketed parks to drive up ticket sales.

669,CMCSA,DEALTALK-Univision sees value in holding off on sale,"(For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on ) By Ronald Grover  and Liana B. Baker June 20(Reuters) - Univision Communications has had several informal sale talks in the past year, but the company’s board could take a year or longer to decide on a potential deal, as the company seeks to boost profits and pay down debt, people familiar with the matter said. Owners of the Spanish-language U.S. media company think it could fetch more by further improving its earnings ahead of an initial public offering or sale in 2015, according to three people familiar with the board’s thinking. Univision’s reluctance to commit to a formal sale process at this stage highlights the challenges that the company’s potential suitors face in winning what is widely considered to be one of the media industry’s most highly coveted businesses. The company held preliminary talks with CBS Corp and Time Warner Inc earlier this year, but those talks were preliminary in nature, the people said. The board, including members who represent private equity firms that bought Univision for $12.3 billion in 2007, could still decide to sell if Univision fetches an offer that is too good to turn down, said one of the people. For now Univision is focused on paying down its $9.2 billion in debt through its rising cash flow, that person added. New York-based Univision was taken private by a group of buyout firms including Haim Saban’s Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners. Mexican media company Televisa owns an 8 percent stake in Univision and has bought debt that could be converted into a stake of up to 30 percent. It holds three board seats and also collects hundreds of millions in licensing revenue and royalties every year from Univision which airs a large chunk of its programming. “It is unclear if Televisa would be willing to divest its stake or even acquire the remainder of the company at this juncture,” Barclays analyst Danish Agboatwala said. A representative for Televisa declined to comment on its plans. Univision reduced its debt by nearly $130 million in the first quarter ended March 31, its most recent quarter, compared to a year ago, according to a financial statement on its website. Net cash flow from operations more than tripled, to $77.8 million in the quarter that ended March 31, as the company enjoyed higher ratings at its UniMas broadcast network and Univision Deportes Network cable sports channel. Representatives for CBS and Time Warner Inc declined to comment. Univision spokeswoman Monica Talan said the company does not comment on rumors. The talks underscore the consolidation sweeping the telecoms, cable and satellite TV industry, which is being shaken up by Comcast Corp’s proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc and AT&T;’s agreement to buy satellite TV provider DirecTV. Walt Disney Co is another media company that could be interested in Univision, analysts said. Maxim Group analyst John Tinker said the fees that Univision collects from pay TV operators could appeal to Disney, while there could also be synergies with its theme park business since many park visitors are Spanish speaking.

670,CMCSA,UPDATE 3-AT&T; tells lawmakers DirecTV deal won't guarantee lower prices,"(Adds comments on reduction of prices, Comcast/Time Warner competition, rewrites throughout) By Marina Lopes and Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers grilled AT&T; Inc and DirecTV on Tuesday over a proposed merger that some Democrats and public interest groups fear will result in higher costs and less competition. The chief executives of the No. 2 wireless carrier and the largest U.S. satellite TV service provider testified about their proposed $48.5 billion deal at hearings in the House of Representatives and the Senate, and said the scale the merger would allow them to save on the high costs of negotiating rights to video content. But there were some tough reactions in Washington. “I am very, very skeptical as a senator, not just as a consumer,” senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said at a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel. Blumenthal asked AT&T; CEO Randall Stephenson whether he could commit to pass on the savings from lower content fees to consumers dollar-for-dollar. “No sir, I can’t,” Stephenson said, but added he hoped the merger would result in slower price increases for consumers. “One would have to believe in the market and the market pressures, and that market pressures will compete margins away and cost savings will find their way into prices.” Michael White, DirecTV’s Chief Executive added that he expected customers to see better value bundles. “It’s pretty hard to commit to lower prices on pure-play TV because of the price of content,” he said. The companies say their merger would also allow them to better compete with cable companies and provide improved Internet service to rural areas. But representatives of content producers and smaller cable operators spoke out against the deal, saying the combined company might wield too much power over the creation, distribution and costs of programming. The AT&T;/DirecTV merger is one of several roiling the cable and wireless industries. Consumer advocates are worried that consolidation might result in fewer choices and higher prices for consumers. The others mergers are Comcast Corp’s $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc and Sprint Corp’s  potential bid for T-Mobile US Inc. The Justice Department, which ensures mergers comply with antitrust law, and the Federal Communications Commission, which has a broader public-interest standard, will have to approve the deal. Lawmakers, although influential, do not have a formal role in deciding the fate of deals. Earlier on Tuesday, Stephenson also told House Judiciary Committee lawmakers that AT&T;’s proposed purchase of DirecTV does not compare with other mergers that are shaking up the telecommunications industry because the companies largely provide different services. Comcast, however, has stressed that its bid for Time Warner Cable would combine two companies that serve different markets, while AT&T; and DirecTV overlap in serving about 25 percent of U.S. households.

678,CMCSA,"Comcast profit boosted by internet subscriber growth, NBC","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s quarterly profit beat estimates as its high-speed Internet business added the most number of customers in six years and profitability improved at NBC Universal. The largest U.S. cable operator’s shares rose as much as 2.6 percent on Tuesday. Comcast added 203,000 net high-speed Internet customers in the second quarter ended June 30, higher than the 161,000 additions analysts expected, according to market research firm StreetAccount. A reasonable estimate for the timing of a shareholder vote on Comcast’s Time Warner Cable Inc (TWC) deal would be in the fall, Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis said. Comcast is seeking regulatory approval for its $45.2 billion bid for TWC, which will help it pick up customers in New York and Los Angeles and extend its X1 cable TV-cum-Internet service to those cities. The company has also been building up its WiFi network, aiming to have 8 million hot spots in 19 of the 30 largest U.S. cities this year. TWC has 34,000 hot spots. The TWC bid has sparked off consolidation efforts in the media and telecoms industry, as demand grows for broadband Internet and streaming video and music content. Telecom company AT&T; Inc, which hardly produces programs, said it would buy satellite TV company DirecTV for $48.5 billion. SoftBank Corp’s arguments for buying T-Mobile US Inc now hinge on creating a scaled counterpoint to Comcast, while Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s bid for Time Warner Inc is about matching Comcast’s leverage,  MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said. “The DOJ and/or FCC will be under tremendous pressure to block at least one of the mega-deals, lest they be viewed as being asleep at the switch.” Comcast’s cable business, which also houses the Internet business, lost 144,000 net video subscribers in the quarter — more than the 123,000 expected.  However, strong Internet business and services sales growth helped revenue grow 5.4 percent to $11.03 billion. Revenue at NBC Universal, the media and entertainment company Comcast bought last year, inched up 0.3 percent to $6.02 billion.  But operating cash flow jumped 20 percent due to broadcast television and filmed entertainment, analysts at JPMorgan, Jefferies and Brean Capital said. Net income attributable to Comcast rose 15 percent to $1.99 billion, or 76 cents per share. Excluding items, it earned 75 cents per share, higher than the average analysts’ estimate of 72 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3.5 percent to $16.84 billion — below an estimated $16.95 billion. Comcast shares were up 1.8 percent at $54.80 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. It gained 3.6 percent this year through Monday’s close. ",7222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-results/comcast-profit-boosted-by-internet-subscriber-growth-nbc-idUSKBN0FR12M20140722

683,CMCSA,Murdoch's Fox expected to push for Time Warner deal on Wednesday,"Aug 4 (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc is expected to make an aggressive case for merging with Time Warner Inc during its quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, though people familiar with the company’s plans have said it would not use that forum to raise its bid. Time Warner is due to report its financial results on Wednesday as well, marking the first time executives from both companies will publicly speak since the offer was first revealed on July 16. It will be an opportunity for Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes to defend his record for shareholder value. Fox’s Chief Operating Officers Chase Carey and James Murdoch will have the chance to discuss the more than $1 billion in cost savings and powerful combination of cable networks and sports programming. It is unclear whether Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of Fox, will make an appearance given the stakes. Fox has offered to buy Time Warner for about $80 billion, or about $85 per share, in a mix of cash and stock. Time Warner turned it down, saying its plan to go it alone “is superior to any proposal” from Fox. Though Fox is expected to raise its offer it will not rise beyond the range of $90 to $95 per share, a person familiar with Fox told Reuters on July 25. The timing of another offer is unclear. Some analysts have said that an even higher bid would be needed to win over Time Warner management and shareholders A spokesman for Fox declined to comment. A potential tie-up would create one of the world’s largest media conglomerates, dominating content production with two major studios, a stable of cable networks like Fox News and TNT, broadcast networks and pay-TV channel HBO. Faced with a rash of media distribution mergers, such as Comcast Corp’s proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and AT&T;’s $48.5 billion deal to buy DirecTV, programming creators are responding with their own potential deals to add clout for negotiations with cable and satellite distributors and new entrants like Netflix  and Amazon. Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger wrote in a note to investors on Friday that it would be in the interest of both companies to ink a deal. He and his team spoke to hundreds of Fox and Time Warner shareholders and concluded that “most people are supportive.” “To reject the $85 a share offer, you would have to believe that Time Warner would get to $95 a share on its own,” he wrote. “We don’t find very many people who think it will be easy to get there.” A Time Warner spokesman declined to comment. With a backdrop of a rebuffed deal, Time Warner will be on the hook to explain why it is better off going solo. Time Warner has outpaced its peers with 15.2 percent earnings per share growth for the past 5 years, nearly double the median for its competitors, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Can Time Warner demonstrate to shareholders that left alone, the value to shareholders would be meaningfully greater than the $85 bid on the table from Fox?” Alan Gould, managing director at Evercore Partners Inc, asked in a research note. For now, Gould pointed out that there does not seem to be an alternative bidder.

684,CMCSA,"UPDATE 1-DirecTV, AT&T; could own Houston sports network under bankruptcy plan","(Adds Comcast comment) By Tom Hals Aug 7 (Reuters) - DirecTV and AT&T; Inc would jointly own a Houston sports network under a plan to end the network’s bankruptcy, although current part-owner Comcast Corp warned it may challenge the proposal. The Houston Regional Sports Network, which operates as Comcast Sportsnet Houston, broadcasts the games of the Houston Astros baseball and Houston Rockets basketball teams. DirecTV Sports Networks would own 60 percent of Houston Regional Sports Network and AT&T; would own 40 percent, according to documents filed late Wednesday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. The plan must be put to a vote of creditors and approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Marvin Isgur. Comcast made clear it did not back the plan in its current form. “The reorganization plan presented raises significant concerns regarding the equitable treatment of the network and its various constituencies,” Comcast said in a statement. “We intend to exercise all of our available rights as part of a fair process.” The network was pushed into bankruptcy by a unit of Comcast Corp, which loaned the network $100 million and filed an involuntary bankruptcy against it in September. At the time, Comcast said the network should be put up for sale and that it was prepared to bid. The sports network owes the Astros $27.8 million for unpaid licensing fees from its 2013 season, and it has not paid the team at all for 2014, according to court documents. The Rockets was owed $44.4 million for its 2013-14 season,  court documents say. The network plans to repay some of what it owes the teams by pursuing legal claims against Comcast for exerting undue influence over the network and attempting to it at a knock-down price, according to court documents. Regional sports networks have risen sharply in value in recent years, thanks to exclusive rights to broadcast games and the loyalties of sports fans. The Houston network was formed in 2003 by the Astros and Rockets to broadcast their games as well as games of the Houston Dynamo soccer team and 150 college games. Comcast bought a stake in 2010. The network has failed to reach a majority of Houston-area viewers due to disagreements with cable and satellite television providers. The reorganization plan unveiled late Wednesday would allow the network to triple its market reach in the Houston area, according to court documents. The documents did not provide detailed financial information. As part of the plan to bring the network out of bankruptcy, new media rights agreements would be negotiated with the Astros and Rockets.

686,CMCSA,"Baseball, hockey leagues lose ruling in broadcast antitrust case","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge rejected an effort by Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, Comcast Corp and DirecTV to dismiss a lawsuit by fans unhappy about restrictions on watching their favorite teams play. Friday’s decision by U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan moves the antitrust lawsuit closer to a possible trial that examines restrictions on how games are broadcast.  “We are obviously pleased,” Ned Diver, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a telephone interview. “We don’t view it as a surprise that the court simply accepted that the leagues and their media partners are subject to the antitrust laws.” A DirecTV spokesman said the company does not discuss pending litigation. Comcast and the sports leagues did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.  At issue were agreements that limit where certain games can be broadcast, which consumers say result in “anticompetitive blackouts.”  Typically, regional sports networks have exclusive rights to broadcast professional baseball and hockey games in their home markets, but cannot broadcast those games elsewhere. Sports fans, however, complained that this lets professional sports leagues charge premium prices to watch games outside home markets - for example, if a San Francisco resident wanted to watch the New York Yankees. Scheindlin rejected an argument by Major League Baseball that it was protected from antitrust claims under an exemption it received from the U.S. Supreme Court in 1922, saying the exemption did not extend to contracts for broadcasting rights. The judge also rejected arguments by both leagues that the broadcasting restrictions had “pro-competitive” justifications, such as offering incentives for clubs to build local fan bases. She said “consciously depriving consumers of out-of-market games they would prefer” is generally not “a permissible aim under the antitrust laws.” Comcast and DirecTV argued they should not be liable because they had no role in creating the restrictions.

687,CMCSA,"Baseball, hockey leagues lose ruling in broadcast antitrust case","NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - A federal judge rejected an effort by Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, Comcast Corp and DirecTV to dismiss a lawsuit by fans unhappy about restrictions on watching their favorite teams play. Friday’s decision by U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan moves the antitrust lawsuit closer to a possible trial that examines restrictions on how games are broadcast. “We are obviously pleased,” Ned Diver, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a telephone interview. “We don’t view it as a surprise that the court simply accepted that the leagues and their media partners are subject to the antitrust laws.” A DirecTV spokesman said the company does not discuss pending litigation. Comcast and the sports leagues did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. At issue were agreements that limit where certain games can be broadcast, which consumers say result in “anticompetitive blackouts.” Typically, regional sports networks have exclusive rights to broadcast professional baseball and hockey games in their home markets, but cannot broadcast those games elsewhere. Sports fans, however, complained that this lets professional sports leagues charge premium prices to watch games outside home markets - for example, if a San Francisco resident wanted to watch the New York Yankees. Scheindlin rejected an argument by Major League Baseball that it was protected from antitrust claims under an exemption it received from the U.S. Supreme Court in 1922, saying the exemption did not extend to contracts for broadcasting rights. The judge also rejected arguments by both leagues that the broadcasting restrictions had “pro-competitive” justifications, such as offering incentives for clubs to build local fan bases. She said “consciously depriving consumers of out-of-market games they would prefer” is generally not “a permissible aim under the antitrust laws.” Comcast and DirecTV argued they should not be liable because they had no role in creating the restrictions. But Scheindlin found enough evidence that the companies defended the broadcast structure, and were “more than passive participants.” The cases are Laumann et al v. National Hockey League et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-01817; and Garber et al v. Office of the Commissioner of Baseball et al in the same court, No. 12-03074.

689,CMCSA,Online video stars mobilize for U.S. net neutrality,"LOS ANGELES, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Online video personalities are joining together to advocate for equal treatment of Internet traffic, aiming to stop the U.S. government from allowing what they worry will be fast and slow lanes for delivering content. The video creators are signing an online petition that will be submitted to the Federal Communications Commission, which is now considering new “net neutrality” rules governing how broadband providers route Internet traffic. Some stars have posted videos about the issue to rally their legions of fans. Internet campaigns have impacted policy issues in the past. In 2012, a massive online mobilization of Internet users and major websites helped sink anti-piracy legislation. Organizers hope the new effort, which they are starting to publicize on Wednesday, will raise the visibility of online video creators and the scope of their industry with regulators. The top stars have built careers by posting videos on Google Inc’s YouTube and other platforms. While many aren’t mainstream celebrities, they reach millions of fans daily. As of Wednesday, dozens of online personalities had joined the effort on www.videocreatorsfornetneutrality.org. Those creators represent more than 10,000 videos that have been viewed 5.2 billion times, according to the website. “This is a huge community, and they will be massively impacted by this,” said Michael Weinberg, a vice president at consumer group Public Knowledge, one of the organizers behind the petition. Another organizer is The Harry Potter Alliance, a group of  fans who advocate for social change. The FCC’s proposal, while prohibiting Internet providers from blocking content, suggests allowing some “commercially reasonable” deals where content companies such as Netflix  or Amazon.com could pay broadband providers such as Comcast Corp or Verizon Communications  to ensure smooth and fast delivery of their web traffic. Critics, which include Netflix, worry that such rules could result in “slow lanes” for content from sources that do not pay. Video creators are concerned that such rules would limit the ability of independent producers to reach audiences. The petitioners are asking the FCC to consider classifying Internet service as a public utility, a step advocates say would give the agency more power to stop potential net neutrality violators. Among the advocates are YouTube stars Hank Green and his brother John Green, a novelist who wrote the book that was the basis for the hit movie “The Fault in Our Stars.” In a video posted on their vlogbrothers YouTube channel, Hank Green stages a debate between himself as an Internet user, and himself as a representative of an Internet service provider. The video has been viewed more than 512,000 times. Hank Green said he decided to speak out because “the Internet, and particularly the flat and neutral Internet, was the most significant driver of new economic growth of the last 20 years,” and he doesn’t want new rules to interfere with that.

690,CMCSA,U.S. asks Comcast for more data to review Time Warner Cable merger,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. communications regulators on Friday asked Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) for additional details about its video and broadband operations, including its web traffic management practices, to review the company’s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N. The Federal Communications Commission is reviewing whether the proposed $45 billion merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest U.S. cable providers, is in the public interest. As is common with FCC merger reviews, the agency sought more information from the companies about their business and future plans than the companies first submitted in their application earlier this year.  Notably, the FCC asked numerous questions focused on Comcast’s broadband business, seeking an overview of the company’s competitors in each geographic area, use of data caps and tools for traffic management. Though analysts predict that the FCC will ultimately approve the merger, the regulators are expected to impose various conditions. Particular attention is on Internet traffic management issues as the FCC is working on new “net neutrality” rules that guide how Internet providers route web content on their networks and could use merger conditions in lieu of rules that are facing a heated debate.  In Friday’s letter to Comcast, the FCC asked for all documents related to “the Company’s decisions whether to block, stop, throttle, slow, favor, congest or otherwise hinder the transmission of any (online video distributor) service or other content ... or to favor, prioritize or otherwise advantage the Company’s relevant service over such competing service.”  The agency also asked for all documents related to how consumers may benefit or be disadvantaged by how Comcast, thanks to its size, negotiates Internet traffic delivery agreements with content creators or delivery services, which could mean companies like Netflix Corp Inc (NFLX.O) and Level 3 Communications Inc LVLT.N. Additionally, the FCC sought detailed tables on interconnections with other services carrying web traffic as well as network congestion. The FCC also sought data on consumer satisfaction and success getting and retaining customers, including in ethnic groups.  Similar requests went to Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications Inc CHRT.O, which has proposed to acquire some of Comcast’s subscribers to leave Comcast with less than 30 percent of the U.S. residential cable or satellite TV market. Most of the content of Comcast’s and others’ responses are unlikely to be public, because such business information is deemed highly confidential. The responses to the FCC are due by Sept. 11. (For the FCC's information request to Comcast, see bit.ly/1llRw4i) The Department of Justice is also reviewing the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger for antitrust issues, though the companies stress they do not directly compete in any market.

A proxy statement, prepared for the shareholders meetings of both companies in October to vote on the merger, also lays out the nearly $81.8  million golden parachute that Time Warner Cable’s chairman and chief executive, Robert D. Marcus, would receive. His payment includes cash, restricted stock, options and $300,000 to pay for financial planning services. In all, the company will hand out golden parachutes of more than $136 million to five of its top executives if the deal closes. Comcast Corp last February said it would buy Time Warner Cable Inc in a $45.2 billion stock swap that combines the two largest U.S. cable operators. The day before the deal was announced, the compensation committee of Time Warner Cable’s board approved retention grants for more than 1,800 employees that would pay twice the regularly scheduled annual equity awards granted for each person in 2014.  The awards, which the proxy said totaled approximately $316.4 million in restricted stock, were awarded to compensate for bonuses in 2015 and 2016 the employees would not receive, according to the proxy. The compensation committee also approved up to $100 million in supplemental bonuses to the more than 15,000 employees eligible to receive cash incentive bonuses. Those bonuses would equal 50 percent of each employee’s target bonus for 2014. “The supplemental bonus opportunity was intended to enhance employee retention during the pendency of the merger, while preserving incentives designed to keep employees focused on executing on TWC’s operating plan,” according to the proxy.

699,CMCSA,Exclusive: State attorneys general probing AT&T; deal for DirecTV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - State attorneys general working to determine whether Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) deal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N is legal have expanded their investigation to include AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) plans to buy DirecTV DTV.O, according to sources close to the merger probe. Some two dozen states were already coordinating with the U.S. Justice Department to interview critics and proponents of the Comcast merger, which some lawmakers and public interest groups fear will result in higher costs and less competition. The states have now broadened their focus to include AT&T;’s $48.5 billion proposed deal for DirecTV, the No. 1 U.S. satellite TV provider, according to sources close to the probe, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. New York and California are part of the multi-state review, the sources said. Florida acknowledged that it was part of the group. Indiana said it was looking at the deal but declined to say if it was working with the group of state attorneys general. It is not unusual for attorneys general to join a Justice Department investigation of a major merger that potentially affects consumers in their state. Asked about the expanded investigation, AT&T; spokesman Michael Balmoris said: “We look forward to discussions with these state attorneys generals on the significant consumer benefits created by this merger.” While antitrust experts have said they expect the AT&T; deal to be approved, the proposed transaction has raised hackles for several reasons. One is because of lost competition in the estimated quarter of U.S. homes where AT&T;, the No. 2 wireless carrier, offers U-Verse, fiber optic delivery of television programming, high-speed Internet and home phone service. DirecTV, a satellite alternative to local cable providers, is present in those markets. The attorneys general also are looking at programming issues, one source said. Content producers and smaller cable operators worry that the combined company might wield too much power over the creation, distribution and costs of programming. They also are asking questions about the merger’s effects on the development of high-speed broadband. As part of the deal, AT&T; pledged to expand broadband to 70 million consumer locations. The Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission must sign off on both deals before they can close.

702,CMCSA,"Deluged with comments, U.S. FCC to continue 'net neutrality' outreach","WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Monday will formally stop accepting public comments on proposed new Internet traffic, or “net neutrality,” rules but will continue reaching out to Americans as they review the controversial regulations. Monday is the deadline for submitting comments to the Federal Communications Commission on so-called Open Internet rules that regulate how Internet service providers (ISPs) manage traffic on their networks. A record 1.5 million comments have already flooded the agency since Chairman Tom Wheeler revealed his proposal in April. Consumer advocacy groups pounced on proposed rules they saw as creating fast and slow “lanes” on the web. Under the proposed rules, ISPs such as Comcast Corp  would be prohibited from blocking users’ access to websites or applications but could charge content companies, such as Netflix Inc, to ensure quick and reliable delivery of their traffic to users, as long as such deals are deemed “commercially reasonable.” The FCC plans several workshops in coming weeks on technological, economic and legal aspects of the rules, which will be open to the public in Washington and will be streamed live online. People can submit comments to FCC staff by email and on Twitter. The first two workshops on Tuesday will focus on policy approaches to the rules and how mobile broadband should be treated. No formal deadline exists for the FCC to set new rules, which require a majority vote at the five-member FCC for approval. The workshops are planned through early October, so the vote is unlikely before November. Wheeler has said he wanted to set new rules as quickly as possible, given the void created by a federal court’s rejection in January of the FCC’s earlier version. That means he could present a new draft of the rules before the end of the year. Responding to calls for action from advocacy groups and a segment by comedian John Oliver on his HBO show, Americans overwhelmed the FCC with comments through online automated submission forms, email and mail. The net neutrality submissions smashed the FCC’s previous record of 1.4 million comments submitted about singer Janet Jackson’s accidental breast exposure during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004. They also trumped more than 1 million comments the U.S. State Department last year said it had received on its environmental review of the Keystone XL pipeline. The outcry on net neutrality, triggered in part by what insiders said was a leak of the unfinished proposal,  has prompted Wheeler to alter the plan to ask whether “some or all” pay-for-priority deals should be banned and whether ISPs should be entirely reclassified to face regulations more like public utilities, an approach backed by advocacy groups. Wheeler has repeatedly reassured the public of his intent to  police any discrimination, which ISPs say would not be in their business interest anyway. FCC staff have also held several online question-and-answer sessions and are likely to do others.

703,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-Entropic to explore strategic options amid order delays,"(Adds details, share movement, analyst comments) By Soham Chatterjee and Lehar Maan Sept 16 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Entropic Communications Inc  said it was exploring strategic options amid order delays that it warned would continue through the year, hurting the company’s efforts to turn a profit. Entropic, which did not say what those options were, also lowered its revenue forecast for the current quarter blaming slower spending by telecom and cable customers in light of several big mergers. The company’s shares rose as much as 11 percent but lost some of those gains to trade 3.2 percent higher at $2.84 by midday. “We expect continued softness in the fourth quarter as we are again seeing new product deployment delays,” Chief Financial Officer David Lyle said in a statement on Tuesday. Entropic supplies chips for set-top boxes for cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. “The timing of the announcement is a little discouraging,” BWS Financial analyst Hamed Khorsand said. “The company has been going through a transition for several quarters and management has been continuously suggesting (fourth quarter) would be the turnaround point.” Entropic, which reported declining revenues in seven of its previous eight quarters, lowered its revenue forecast for the quarter ending Sept. 30 to $43 million, from its earlier outlook of between $49 million and $51 million. Also, the company said it now expects an adjusted loss of 15 cents per share for the third quarter, worse than its earlier loss forecast of 11 cents per share. Entropic said it had engaged Barclays to help explore strategic options and that it had not set a timetable for completion of the process. The company set in motion a restructuring plan in June, saying it would close and consolidate several offices globally, impacting 23 percent of its workforce and helping it save $24 million annually.

707,CMCSA,U.S. regulators look into treating Internet TV like cable,"WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering a  change in how it regulates Internet TV, potentially putting it on the same footing as traditional cable and satellite television, an FCC official familiar with the idea said on Tuesday. If formalized and approved, the change would help Internet TV services, such as ones being developed by Dish Network Corp , Sony Corp and Verizon Communications Inc , compete with traditional pay-TV for digital rights to major network programming. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, however, indicated the plan has not been circulated yet to the four FCC commissioners, who would have to vote to formally propose it and begin the process of collecting public comments. “Somebody found out that it was an idea that was being kicked around ... and that’s where it stands,” Wheeler said Tuesday. “I’m not ready to plant the flag,” he added. The idea concerns online subscription video services that offer scheduled programming similar to traditional pay-TV providers, and not online video services such as Netflix Inc  that stream content on-demand. Traditionally, the FCC has ensured that cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp could negotiate for rights to retransmit major network programming. Online video services have not had the same regulatory backing because they rely on a different technology and do not have their own video distribution facilities. Now, the FCC’s Media Bureau is proposing leveling the playing field with a technology-neutral definition of a “multichannel video program distributor,” said the FCC official who spoke anonymously to discuss matters that have not been made public. The goal behind the plan is to encourage new and stronger competition in the video market. “You want to make sure that you’re always keeping up with technology, you’re always keeping up with innovations in the marketplace. This falls into that kind of category,” Wheeler told reporters, when asked what prompted the consideration. A draft of the proposal tentatively concludes that Internet TV services should have the same access to major network programming as traditional pay-TV services and seeks comments on whether the obligations imposed on the two types of video services should also be the same, the FCC official said. It was unclear how quickly the proposal could come up for a vote by FCC commissioners, but it could potentially be as soon as Oct. 17. If adopted, analysts see the proposal as creating a possible new opening for Aereo, a video streaming company whose business model was questioned by a Supreme Court ruling in June that said the company had infringed broadcasters’ copyrights by capturing live and recorded programs through antennas and transmitting them to subscribers.

708,CMCSA,DEALS-European buyers buoy cross border deals while inversions slow,"LONDON/NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - European companies emboldened to spend their large cash balances on U.S. rivals have boosted global deal volumes by 60 percent so far in 2014, just as new government rules look set to dampen U.S. companies’ deal making abroad aimed at cutting taxes. After several years of economic stagnation, European chief executives are feeling more confident that the crisis is behind them. Keen to buy growth in an anemic economy and capitalize on cheap financing and ample cash reserves, they are pulling the trigger on deals in the faster-growing American economy. “In a world where Europe is slow, China is slowing, and the U.S. is actually accelerating, you want to be in the U.S. European companies realize they are underinvested in the best part of the world for the next several years,” said Michael Santini, global head of Deutsche Bank AG’s  industrials group. Global mergers and acquisitions have surged to $2.66 trillion year to date, up 60.1 percent from the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data as of September 26. That was the highest level since 2007, when deal volume hit $3.2 trillion. The volume of cross-border transactions is up 119 percent, passing the $1 trillion mark for the first time since 2007 and accounting for nearly 40 percent of total deals globally. In the year-ago period, cross-border deals made up just 29 percent of global activity. In the past two weeks alone, a slew of large cross-border deals were struck, led by German companies seeking to expand into the United States. Drugs and chemicals maker Merck KGaA agreed to buy U.S. based Sigma-Aldrich Corp for $17 billion; industrial group Siemens is acquiring U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand for $7.6 billion; and German car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen reached a deal to buy U.S.-based TRW Automotive Holdings Corp for $13.5 billion, including debt. “Several years of internal focus on efficiency and portfolio trimming, strong balance sheets as well as increased confidence of boardrooms have led to increased M&A; activity of German corporates,” said Jens Maurer at Morgan Stanley, responsible for M&A; in Germany. Not only German companies are looking for U.S. acquisitions, says Dirk Albersmeier, head of German M&A; at JPMorgan Chase . “The fact that so many German companies have announced deals in the past 10 days is a bit of a coincidence. It is unlikely that that pace will be kept up. Instead, you will see (outbound) transactions from other European countries,” he said. Norway’s Yara International and Chicago-based CF Industries are in talks on a merger that would create a $27.5 billion global fertilizer producer, while Sweden’s Electrolux in September struck a $3.3 billion deal to buy General Electric Co’s appliance business, its biggest deal ever. European M&A; as a result is up 83 percent from last year, totaling $685 billion, or 26 percent of the global market. Activity in the United States is up 63 percent to $1.23 trillion, accounting for the lion’s share of global deal making, with 46 percent, Thomson Reuters data show. However, some factors contributing to caution in boardrooms are the volatility in the Middle East, as well as heightened regulatory scrutiny around some of the biggest transactions. Sprint Corp and its parent, Softbank Corp, decided to end their pursuit of T-Mobile US after conceding that U.S. antitrust regulators would likely block  such a tie-up. The proposed mergers of Comcast Corp  and Time Warner Cable, and AT&T; and DirecTV  are also pending regulatory reviews. “There is continued caution around the regulatory environment as deals are getting bigger and industries are consolidating,” said Gregg Lemkau, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Group. The wave of European purchases of U.S. firms has counterbalanced activity earlier in the year in which at least 10 U.S. companies chased European targets in a so-called tax inversion. Such deals allow them to be domiciled in countries that have a lower corporate tax rate. But the U.S. Treasury Department last week announced a series of moves designed to make new inversions more difficult to do and less economically rewarding. The rules apply to deals that have been announced but not yet completed, including AbbVie’s agreement to buy Shire Plc for $54.7 billion and Medtronic’s  proposed $42.9 billion acquisition of Covidien Plc, raising doubts that the deals will proceed. The rules could also deter other U.S. companies, such as Pfizer, from seeking their own inversion deals. Pfizer had been looking for alternative deals after its $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca failed in May over price. The pace of inversions had already slowed in recent months. Since August, only one such deal was announced, when Burger King  said it planned to buy Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc for $11.5 billion and base the merged company in Canada. Multi-billion dollar deals are driving activity so far this year, with 76 deals worth more than $5 billion announced compared with 32 deals in the year-ago period, according to Thomson Reuters data. “This year has been about the return of the large strategic acquirers and the return of big deals,” Goldman Sachs’ Lemkau said. “The biggest companies are continuing to actively assess and pursue their most important strategic objectives via M&A.;” But some of these deals have been expensive. With stock markets at record-high levels, the average premium buyers paid over target companies’ four-week stock prices was 25.5 percent, down from 27.8 percent in the same period last year and 30.3 percent in 2012. But on an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) basis, valuations continued to climb. Buyers on average paid targets 12 times EBITDA in the first nine months of the year, compared with 11.2 times in the same period last year. That was the highest since 2007, according to Thomson Reuters data. For U.S. targets, buyers paid a much higher 14.6 times EBITDA, up from 11 times last year. “The single most important constraint at the moment is to justify valuations,” said Wilhelm Schulz, head of EMEA M&A; at Citigroup. “The good thing is that so far the market has been receptive to M&A; and in a low-yield environment, M&A; is still seen as a good solution, and a better option compared to share buy-backs or increased dividends.” Deutsche Bank’s Santini said some European buyers eyeing U.S. deals may choose to act sooner rather than later amid expectations U.S. rates will rise in 2015 while Europe will continue to hold rates at zero to try to stimulate growth. “The U.S. dollar could strengthen relative to the euro so the cost of acquisitions could be more economical today,” he said. Buyout firms have been forced to sit back and watch, with private equity-backed leveraged buyouts accounting for just 7.4 percent of total M&A; activity, compared with 10.3 percent this time last year. Goldman Sachs was the top M&A; adviser worldwide, with almost $777 billion worth of deals. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch rounded out the top five.

709,CMCSA,FCC pauses clock on Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Friday it paused its “shot-clock” on the review of the proposed $45 billion merger between the two largest U.S. cable providers, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc. The FCC, which will determine whether the deal is in the public interest, said it is stopping its informal 180-day clock to review the merger until Oct. 29, the new deadline for the public and stakeholders to comment, or until the agency is satisfied with Comcast’s response to requests for additional information. The deadline had been set for Oct. 8. On Friday, the FCC’s review of the merger was in day 85 of the 180-day self-imposed informal deadline to complete transaction reviews. The FCC’s review had been expected to be finished on or around Jan. 6.  The Department of Justice is also reviewing the proposed deal for antitrust issues. Consumer advocates and some competitors have urged the FCC to reject it, saying the combined company would have too much clout over what Americans watch on television and how they access the Internet. Comcast has stressed it does not directly compete with Time Warner Cable in any market and argued that, together, they could invest and innovate to bring better services to more Americans. As is common with major mergers, the FCC asked the companies in August for a lot of additional data on their video and broadband operations, including Web traffic management practices.  On Friday, the FCC said in a letter to the companies’ executives that Comcast and Time Warner Cable had submitted their responses belatedly, and the agency’s staff “has found that a number of the answers in each of your submissions are incomplete.” Comcast said it answered all the FCC’s questions and will work with the reviewers to sort out what is missing. “We will work with the staff to determine the additional information the FCC is seeking (including the document production that the FCC had asked us to delay filing) and will submit supplemental answers and documents quickly thereafter so that the FCC can complete its review early in 2015,” Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said in a statement. The FCC is weighing how to resolve a hitch in collecting Comcast’s programing and retransmission consent agreements after large media companies objected, saying the agency’s filing process threatens the documents’ high confidentiality.  Comcast said those agreements have already been submitted to the Justice Department, whose review is confidential. The FCC said a voluminous recent filing from Comcast - nearly 850-pages long - also warranted a delay in the deadline for public comments. Satellite provider Dish Network Corp had petitioned the FCC for a delay. Comcast’s lengthy document, submitted to counter filings from critics, included an analysis related to the question of its discrimination against non-affiliated programing, which introduced “a relatively substantial body of new material” that is “critical to the review,” the FCC added.

The deadline had been set for Oct. 8. On Friday, the FCC’s review of the merger was in day 85 of the 180-day self-imposed informal deadline to complete transaction reviews. The FCC’s review had been expected to be finished on or around Jan. 6. The Department of Justice is also reviewing the proposed deal for antitrust issues. Consumer advocates and some competitors have urged the FCC to reject it, saying the combined company would have too much clout over what Americans watch on television and how they access the Internet. Comcast has stressed it does not directly compete with Time Warner Cable in any market and argued that, together, they could invest and innovate to bring better services to more Americans. As is common with major mergers, the FCC asked the companies in August for a lot of additional data on their video and broadband operations, including Web traffic management practices. On Friday, the FCC said in a letter to the companies’ executives that Comcast and Time Warner Cable had submitted their responses belatedly, and the agency’s staff “has found that a number of the answers in each of your submissions are incomplete.” Comcast said it answered all the FCC’s questions and will work with the reviewers to sort out what is missing. “We will work with the staff to determine the additional information the FCC is seeking (including the document production that the FCC had asked us to delay filing) and will submit supplemental answers and documents quickly thereafter so that the FCC can complete its review early in 2015,” Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said in a statement. The FCC is weighing how to resolve a hitch in collecting Comcast’s programming and retransmission consent agreements after large media companies objected, saying the agency’s filing process threatens the documents’ high confidentiality. Comcast said those agreements have already been submitted to the Justice Department, whose review is confidential. The FCC said a voluminous recent filing from Comcast - nearly 850-pages long - also warranted a delay in the deadline for public comments. Satellite provider Dish Network Corp  had petitioned the FCC for a delay. Comcast’s lengthy document, submitted to counter filings from critics, included an analysis related to the question of its discrimination against non-affiliated programming, which introduced “a relatively substantial body of new material” that is “critical to the review,” the FCC added.

713,CMCSA,Verizon's Redbox Instant video streaming service to shut down,"NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Redbox Instant, a streaming video service operated by Verizon Communications Inc and Outerwall Inc’s Redbox, will shut down next week because the venture has not been as successful as hoped, the two companies announced Saturday. The service, which combined the Redbox DVD rental kiosk business with a streaming video offering from Verizon, was launched in 2013 to compete against online video company Netflix Inc, but never caught on with consumers. Redbox Instant will shut down on Oct. 7th, the companies said in a joint statement. “The joint venture partners made this decision after careful consideration,” the statement said. “The service had not been as successful as either partner hoped it would be.” Subscribers will receive an email notifying them of the termination of the service. A separate email will be sent on Oct. 10 with details on refunds, the statement said. The alliance marked Verizon’s first foray into video streaming outside its network operating region, but it never gained a foothold against online rivals such as Netflix, Amazon.com Inc and Hulu Plus. The telephone company had only offered Web video services to subscribers using its FiOS TV service, which competes with cable providers such as Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable .

714,CMCSA,CEO Bewkes needs to show Time Warner better alone than with Murdoch,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ten years ago, Walt Disney Co, having fended off a hostile bid from Comcast, had to make a case why it was better off as an independent company. It succeeded. Disney’s shares have soared more than 250 percent since. Now, Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes faces a similar moment of reckoning after rejecting a bid for $85 a share from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox.  Bewkes and other top brass will be under pressure at a meeting with analysts and investors next Wednesday to show they can repeat Disney’s magic. “Disney pleaded the case to get its share price up on their own,” said David Miller, an analyst with Topeka Capital Markets. “We think that Mr. Bewkes will attempt to drive home the same concept,” he said, adding it remained to be seen if Bewkes would manage to replicate Disney’s sterling stock performance. Time Warner is trading at around $73 - more than twice its price since Bewkes took over as CEO in 2008, but still below Murdoch’s original $85 bid. Fox had considered boosting the offer to as high as $95 a share, people familiar with the matter said.  Rejection has had its price. Time Warner shares have dropped 15 percent since Aug. 5, when Fox walked away from its offer. Fox shares are up 5.7 percent over the same period. “It’s too simple to say that Bewkes has to get the stock price over $85,” said Gabelli & Co analyst Brett Harriss.  “He has to tell us why he said no to Fox. Time Warner has said nothing - only that at no price would it combine with Fox.” Gabelli, an asset management firm, holds shares in Time Warner. Harriss thought a combined Fox and Time Warner would benefit both companies.  Bewkes, who last stood in front of investors during a similar meeting four years ago, will lay out a long-term vision for the company’s Warner Bros movie studio, Turner Broadcasting cable networks and pay TV channel HBO. Those plans could include letting consumers buy HBO without a cable subscription, given the popularity of the HBO GO mobile app, some analysts have said.  Topeka’s Miller said that a new broadband-only product similar to Netflix could crack open new markets. Topeka estimates that there are approximately 9 million households in the United States with Internet access but no pay TV and roughly 66 million households with pay TV but no HBO. Indeed, Bewkes has slowly changed his tune about Netflix that he once derided as a “200-pound chimp.” He said Monday, at a conference hosted by Hollywood website The Wrap, that he wished he personally owned the streaming video service, given its market value of around $30 billion. There are other signs of Time Warner’s long-term plan that have emerged over the past weeks.  Turner Broadcasting and Disney’s ESPN more than doubled their annual payments to the NBA under a new nine-year deal worth more than $22 billion. Collectively, TBS and ESPN will pay more than $2.5 billion, starting in the 2016-17 season, to the basketball league. The networks coughed up more to keep the rights out of the hands of Fox - which started its own sports network - and those of other rivals. The pricey content deal comes as Turner, which also operates the 24-hour news channel CNN, attempts to crack down on costs. The company, which employs about 14,000 full-time staffers, is poised to slash 10 percent of its workforce. Focusing on internal operations is how Disney jolted it shares, noted Topeka’s Miller - a strategy likely to be embraced by Bewkes.

715,CMCSA,Obama says unequivocally committed to 'net neutrality',"SANTA MONICA Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama declared himself fully committed to “net neutrality” on Thursday while U.S. regulators review controversial new regulations that would govern how Internet service providers (ISPs) manage traffic on their networks. The Federal Communications Commission has received a record 3.7 million comments since Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed new so-called Open Internet rules in April. Consumer advocacy groups criticized the rules for creating fast and slow “lanes” on the web.  “Net neutrality” refers to the idea that Internet service providers should enable equal access to all content regardless of source. The proposed rules would ban ISPs from blocking or slowing users’ access to websites but allow them to charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of traffic to users.  “I am unequivocally committed to net neutrality,” Obama said to applause from a group of company start-up founders in California. “It’s what has unleashed the power of the Internet, and we don’t want to lose that or clog up the pipes.” Obama said he was opposed to the idea of paid prioritization, which would allow some to pay more for exclusive access to customers on the web. Under the proposed rules, ISPs such as Comcast Corp would be prohibited from blocking users’ access to websites or applications but could charge content companies, such as Netflix Inc, to ensure quick and reliable delivery of their traffic to users. Obama acknowledged that the proposed rules had raised concerns among advocates of net neutrality. He noted that the FCC was independent but said Wheeler was aware of his views. “My appointee, Tom Wheeler, knows my position. I can’t, now that he’s there, I can’t just call him up and tell him exactly what to do,” Obama said. “But what I’ve been clear about, what the White House has been clear about, is that we expect whatever final rules to emerge to make sure that we’re not creating two or three or four tiers of Internet.

718,CMCSA,Netflix: Will continue to fight Comcast deal for Time Warner Cable,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Netflix Inc, stung at paying Comcast Corp for faster video delivery to its customers, said on Wednesday it had no intention of dropping its fight against Comcast’s plan to buy rival Time Warner Cable Inc. Netflix has said it is concerned about Comcast’s clout, which would grow with the acquisition of Time Warner Cable, in hampering Netflix’s ability to get movies and television from its servers to its subscribers’ television screens. “We continue to focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, to prevent large ISPs (internet service providers) from holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance in order to extract payments from us, other Internet content firms, and Internet transit suppliers,” Netflix said in a letter to shareholders. “We will continue to advocate for the U.S. government to block the merger of Comcast/TWC or, at the very least, prevent a combined entity from charging for interconnection,” the company said. In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service. Comcast took issue with the idea that paying for interconnection was appropriately addressed in a merger review. “Interconnection is not a Comcast-TWC transaction specific issue,” a company spokeswoman said in an email statement. “The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is looking at this issue in an industry wide examination, which is where it should be reviewed rather than in a deal that only affects one company in the marketplace.” ",10152014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-timewarnercable-comcast-netflix/netflix-will-continue-to-fight-comcast-deal-for-time-warner-cable-idUSKCN0I42SJ20141015

725,CMCSA,"Comcast reports higher quarterly revenue, profit","NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp reported on Thursday higher quarterly revenue and income as more people signed up for its high speed Internet service. Total revenue at the largest U.S. cable operator, which owns NBC Universal, rose to $16.79 billion in the third quarter, up 4 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts had been expecting $16.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Comcast said it added 315,000 net high speed Internet subscribers, a 5.8 percent uptick over the same period. About 81,000 customers canceled video subscriptions, far fewer than the net loss of 127,000 in the 2013 third quarter. Analysts had forecast a net loss of 93,000 subscribers, according to StreetAccount. The decrease in cable subscriptions is a closely watched figure that has taken on even more prominence given two major announcements from Time Warner Inc HBO and CBS Corp  last week. Both the pay TV network and broadcaster are launching services that allow people to watch programs with only a broadband connection. Cable and satellite distributors are seeking ways to stop consumers, especially younger ones, from dumping their cable subscriptions, or “cutting the cord.” On the media side, Comcast reported that revenue at NBC Universal division inched up 1.2 percent to $5.92 billion on the strength of advertising revenue at broadcast network NBC and its theme parks. Third quarter net income increased almost 50 percent to $2.59 billion, or 99 cents per share. Adjusted for a one-time tax settlement, earnings per share rose to 73 cents from 65 cents in the year-ago period. Comcast is in the process of acquiring Time Warner Cable , which it had agreed to buy for $45.3 billion earlier this year.

726,CMCSA,Neil Patrick Harris takes hosting talents to NBC variety series,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - With the Emmys and Tonys under his belt and his first Oscars hosting gig lined up, actor Neil Patrick Harris is turning his talents to anchor a new NBC variety show, the Comcast Corp-owned broadcast network said on Monday. Harris, 41, best known as the womanizing Barney Stinson on long-running CBS sitcom “How I Met Your Mother,” will host the new primetime series, which will feature live comedy skits, musical numbers, game shows and hidden camera pranks on celebrities, NBC said in a statement. The format of the yet-to-be-titled series is based on the popular British ITV show “Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway,” which has already been adapted in numerous European markets including German and Italian versions.  NBC has ordered 10 episodes of the U.S. series from ITV Studios America, which will be filmed in front of a live audience. No air date has been scheduled yet.   The show is the latest on Harris’s portfolio after it was announced earlier this month that he would be the host of the 2015 Oscars. The actor recently won a best musical actor Tony award for his Broadway stint in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” and co-starred in David Fincher’s hit thriller film “Gone Girl.” The new variety series follows NBC’s push towards televised event spectaculars, trying to draw people to watch live rather than delayed or on-demand programs.

727,CMCSA,U.S. regulators to vote on treating Internet TV like cable,"WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission in coming weeks will vote on whether Internet TV should have the same access to television programming as cable and satellite TV providers, which could shake up competition in the video industry. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler on Tuesday said he has asked his fellow commissioners to vote on a proposal that would help Internet TV services, such as ones being developed by Dish Network Corp, Sony Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, to compete with traditional pay-TV for digital rights to major network programming. The potential regulatory change concerns online subscription video services that offer scheduled programming similar to traditional pay-TV providers, and not online video services such as Netflix Inc that stream content on demand. Satellite provider DirecTV is another company that has indicated plans for an Internet video service and CBS Corp  this month revealed a plan for an Internet streaming service that would include scheduled programming. Time Warner Inc’s HBO will also launch a standalone online streaming product but its details are unclear. Traditionally, the FCC has ensured that cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp could negotiate for rights to retransmit network programming. Online video services have not had the same regulatory backing because they rely on a different technology and do not have their own video distribution facilities. Now, the FCC will vote on leveling the playing field with a technology-neutral definition of a “multichannel video program distributor,” with the goal of encouraging new competition in the video market. “Twenty-first century consumers shouldn’t be shackled to rules that only recognize 20th-century technology,” Wheeler said in a blog post on Tuesday. “Consumers have long complained about how their cable service forces them to buy channels they never watch. The move of video onto the Internet can do something about that frustration, but first Internet video services need access to the programs.” A draft of the proposal tentatively concludes that online TV services should have the same access to cable and local TV programs as traditional pay-TV services and seeks comments on whether the obligations imposed on the two types of video services should also be the same. If adopted, some analysts see the proposal as potentially also creating a new opening for Aereo, a video streaming company whose business model was questioned by a Supreme Court ruling in June that said the company had infringed broadcasters’ copyrights by capturing live and recorded programs through antennas and transmitting them to subscribers. The vote by four FCC commissioners, two Democrats and two Republicans, would formally propose the idea and begin the process of seeking public comments.

729,CMCSA,Comcast settles lawsuit over overcharging cable TV subscribers,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp has reached a $50 million settlement in a decade-old lawsuit accusing it of overcharging cable television subscribers, 1-1/2 years after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a larger version of the class-action case. The preliminary settlement, which requires court approval, calls for Comcast to pay $16.67 million in cash to current and former subscribers in Philadelphia and four nearby countries. Comcast will also offer current subscribers as much as $33.33 million in services via a $15 bill credit or free Internet upgrades or movies worth up to $43.90. More than 800,000 subscribers are believed to be included. Comcast denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Settlement papers were filed on Tuesday with the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, where Comcast is based. Neither Comcast nor lawyers for the plaintiffs responded immediately to requests for comment. The lawyers plan to seek as much as $15 million to cover fees and expenses. In the lawsuit, begun in December 2003, the plaintiffs accused Comcast of trying to monopolize the Philadelphia-area cable TV market and unfairly raising prices by buying rivals or swapping coverage areas, resulting in peak market share of 77.8 percent in 2002. In March 2013, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, threw out an earlier version of the lawsuit that covered more than 2 million subscribers. Scalia said the proposed subscriber class failed to show they were harmed in sufficiently similar ways, or that damages could be measured classwide rather than individually. A fourth amended complaint covering the smaller class was filed this April, and became the basis for the settlement. In a court filing, Eric Green, a retired Boston University law professor who mediated the settlement, said it was an “excellent result” for class members. The settlement covers Comcast customers in Philadelphia, Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties in Pennsylvania who subscribe to video programming services other than basic cable, or who did so between 2003 and 2008.     The case is Glaberson et al v. Comcast et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, No. 03-06604.

Senator Patrick Leahy last week wrote to top Internet service providers (ISPs), urging them to pledge that they would not enter any so-called paid prioritization deals, in which content companies would pay ISPs to ensure smooth and fast delivery of their traffic.  “We have repeatedly made clear - both to our customers and more generally to the public - ‘Comcast doesn’t prioritize Internet traffic or have paid fast lanes, and we have no plans to do so,’” Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen told Leahy in a letter dated Oct. 24 and viewed by Reuters late on Wednesday. AT&T;, in its response on Thursday, said it had no plans to strike deals with third parties to prioritize traffic as it travels the so-called last mile of the network from the ISP’s facilities to consumers’ screens “without the knowledge and direction of the end user.” The Federal Communications Commission received almost 4 million comments after it proposed new Web traffic, or “net neutrality” rules that prohibited ISPs from blocking content, but suggested allowing some “commercially reasonable” paid prioritization deals.  Verizon Communications Inc on Wednesday published its own response to Leahy, also asserting no plans for “fast lane” deals, and calling paid prioritization a “phantasm” and worries about it “demagoguery, since no major ISP has expressed an interest in offering ‘paid prioritization’ and all agree that the FCC has a valid legal path to prohibit it.”  Though FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has said he would not tolerate anti-competitive or anti-consumer prioritization, consumer advocates and other critics worry that opening the door for such arrangements could create “fast lanes” for some content and so relegate other websites and applications to “slow lanes.”  Instead, some critics have urged the FCC to reclassify ISPs so they are regulated more like public utilities. The broadband companies object, saying it would hamper investments and innovation. In their letters, Comcast, AT&T; and Verizon all argued that the FCC should choose other legal options to prevent harmful paid prioritization short of reclassification. “Departing from the longstanding, bipartisan light-touch approach to the Internet by reclassifying broadband ... would be risky and unnecessary,” Cohen wrote. AT&T;’s Tim McKone, executive vice president for federal relations, wrote that not all prioritization presents a threat to the openness of the Internet, pointing out examples like health or alarm monitoring. He also argued that reclassifying broadband would be a “legally dubious path” that would not actually prevent paid prioritization. The FCC is writing new net neutrality rules after a U.S. appeals court in January struck down their previous version in a case brought by Verizon.

Obama’s detailed statement on the issue of “net neutrality,” a platform in his 2008 presidential campaign, was a rare intervention by the White House into the policy setting of an independent agency. Shares of major Internet service providers Comcast Corp  and Time Warner Cable Inc fell sharply after Obama said ISPs should be reclassified to face stricter regulations and banned from striking paid “fast lane” deals with content companies. The president also said the Federal Communications Commission’s new rules should apply equally to mobile and wired ISPs, with a recognition of special challenges that come with managing wireless networks. “Simply put: No service should be stuck in a ‘slow lane’ because it does not pay a fee,” Obama, currently in Asia, said in a statement released by the White House. “That kind of gate keeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet’s growth.” Nearly 4 million comments flooded the FCC this year after Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed new Internet traffic rules in May that would prohibit the ISPs from blocking any content but allowed content companies to strike “commercially reasonable” deals to ensure their websites and applications load smoothly and swiftly. Although Wheeler had pledged to police any such paid-prioritization deals that would harm consumers, public interest groups worried that his proposed rules would create “fast lanes” for the companies that pay up and relegate others to “slow lanes.” ISPs say they have not and will not strike paid prioritization deals but have balked at the prospect of being regulated more like public utilities. “Reclassification ..., which for the first time would apply 1930s-era utility regulation to the Internet, would be a radical reversal of course,” Verizon Communications Inc said in a statement. Verizon in January won a federal court case challenging the FCC’s previous set of net neutrality rules, which allowed “commercially reasonable” discrimination of traffic but indicated the FCC would disapprove of pay-for-priority deals. The court supported the commission’s authority to regulate broadband access but said the agency was applying stricter rules to ISPs that did not jibe with the way the FCC classified them, which is as an information service. Consumer advocates have for years pressed the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service as a way to have more oversight authority, but ISPs have pledged they would fight the matter in court. Verizon on Monday said a “gratuitous” move to reclassify would probably not stand up in court, while AT&T; said it would expect to participate in a legal challenge. Wheeler, Obama’s friend and former major fundraiser, on Monday reiterated that he, too, opposed Internet fast lanes or harmful prioritization deals but said that approaches including reclassification of ISPs to regulate them more strictly raised substantive legal questions. “We must take the time to get the job done correctly, once and for all, in order to successfully protect consumers and innovators online,” Wheeler said. Obama and other White House officials acknowledged that the FCC, as an independent agency, would ultimately shape the regulations. But Republicans lawmakers quickly seized on Obama’s encroachment, days after their party won control of both houses of Congress in a midterm election largely viewed as a repudiation of the president’s policies. “Net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet,” said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. “It puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered.” Though lobbyists say legislative efforts to overturn new rules would face a White House veto, cable and wireless companies were expected to turn to Republican allies in Congress for stricter oversight of the FCC. “The president’s call ... would turn the Internet into a government-regulated utility and stifle our nation’s dynamic and robust Internet sector with rules written nearly 80 years ago for plain old telephone service,” said Senator John Thune, a Republican expected to lead the Senate Commerce Committee. Wheeler had originally pushed to reinstate net neutrality rules before the end of the year, but experts on Monday said the latest developments probably pushed the process into 2015. Time Warner Cable shares fell as much as 7.2 percent, and closed down almost 5 percent, while Comcast dropped as much as 6.1 percent and closed own 4 percent. Comcast, whose bid to buy Time Warner Cable is under regulatory review, was by far the most actively traded stock on U.S. markets.

The FCC had asked media companies to disclose their contracts with pay-TV providers as it reviewed AT&T; Inc’s  acquisition of DirecTV and Comcast Corp’s  merger with Time Warner Cable Inc. Media companies including Time Warner, Walt Disney Co  and CBS Corp had approached the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, saying the FCC’s order would cause “irreparable harm” to their business. The court said the merger proceedings and the FCC review can continue as the regulator has access to all the materials. “The stay order deals with a procedural matter that has never had anything to do with the substance of our transaction,” Comcast Vice President of Government Communications, Sena Fitzmaurice, said. As the court stated, the Commission can continue its review of the transactions while the stay is in effect, Fitzmaurice said.

752,CMCSA,U.S. FCC pauses Comcast-Time Warner merger review until Jan. 12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Monday once again paused its review of the proposed $45 billion merger of Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc, citing delays in getting documents from Time Warner Cable. The FCC is studying whether the merger, which would combine the two biggest U.S. cable companies, is in the public interest. It had self-imposed an informal 180-day countdown for the review, which will now be paused at day 104 until January 12. The FCC said it learned this month that Time Warner Cable had improperly withheld more than 7,000 documents the regulators had requested, based on an “inappropriate claim of attorney-client privilege.” The agency learned later that more than 31,000 requested documents were missing due to a vendor error. Time Warner Cable submitted the privileged documents in early December but expected to deliver a revised “privilege log” in mid-January. The FCC had asked the companies to respond to its data request by September 11. After the agency reviewers expressed concern about the delays, Time Warner Cable promised to produce the missing documents on Monday, but the FCC said it needed extra time to study new submissions. “The magnitude of the errors ... is material and the delays in rectifying them were substantial so that the tardy productions have interfered with the commission’s ability to conduct a prompt and thorough review of the pending applications,” FCC Media Bureau Chief William Lake wrote to the companies’ Washington officials on Monday. The FCC had paused the review from Oct. 3 to Dec. 3, first for the companies to respond to a massive data request and then to deal with a dispute over confidentiality of documents related to agreements with media companies. Pauses are common in large merger reviews. “Today’s delay is a procedural issue, not a substantive one,” Time Warner Cable spokesman Bobby Amirshahi said in a statement. “We already have provided the FCC more than five million pages of documents and we will continue to provide the FCC everything that they need to review this transaction.” Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said the companies remained on track for the review to be concluded early in 2015. “We are confident that any outstanding documents will be produced to the FCC in an expedited manner,” she said.

757,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-20 states join U.S. antitrust probe of Family Dollar merger,"(Adds details on Family Dollar earnings) By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Some 20 state attorneys general have joined the federal antitrust investigation of competing bids by Dollar General Corp and Dollar Tree Inc  to buy Family Dollar Stores  Inc, a development that potentially complicates the companies’ efforts to win U.S. approval for a deal. The attorneys general concern focuses on the likelihood that the loss of one of the chains would lead to higher prices for discount store customers, many of whom are poor, said two sources who spoke privately because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. Family Dollar, the No. 2 U.S. discount retailer, had previously disclosed that state attorneys general were involved in the federal investigation but gave no details. The 20 states looking at this deal are similar in number to those looking at Comcast Corp’s plan to buy Time Warner Cable Inc and Sysco Corp’s bid for US Foods Inc, both of which are high-profile deals. Florida is a member of the multi-state group, which joined the Federal Trade Commission to determine if the deals were legal under antitrust law, according to Whitney Ray, spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi. Vermont has also joined, said Jill Abrams, an assistant attorney general in the state. Iowa is also in the group, according to a source who was not authorized to speak to reporters. Indiana is looking into the mergers, but a spokesperson declined to say if it had formally joined the group. The presence of the state attorneys general gives the FTC additional lawyers to look at the case, much-needed knowledge of how the merging companies function in the state and how the deal would affect a state’s consumers, said Allen Grunes, an antitrust attorney with the Konkurrenz Group in Washington, DC. “There are times where federal government wants to do one remedy and you have a state or two who believe that there should be more done in their state. They at times will negotiate additional divestitures,” said Grunes. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar declined comment. Dollar General has previously said that it remained committed to the transaction and would continue to work with the FTC. Family Dollar, which has 8,100 discount stores in 46 states, has been targeted for a takeover by both Dollar Tree, which has 5,282 stores in 48 states, and by Dollar General, which is the big dog in discount retailing with 11,000 stores in 40 states. Family Dollar reported a 47 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday as margins fell due to higher discounting. Net income fell to $41.4 million, or 36 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended Nov. 29, from $78 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier. Family Dollar agreed to be bought by smaller rival Dollar Tree for $8.50 billion in cash and stock and rejected a hostile, $9.1 billion offer from Dollar General because of antitrust concerns. In December, Family Dollar shareholders voted by a wide margin to put off a vote approving the Dollar Tree offer, indicating interest in the higher offer despite its risk.

759,CMCSA,Fox loses U.S. copyright claims over Dish ad-skipper,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge has rejected portions of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s lawsuit seeking to stop Dish Network Corp from selling devices that let viewers skip over commercials when playing back shows. In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles rejected copyright claims that Fox had brought over the Hopper, Dish’s digital recording device. Gee invoked last June’s U.S. Supreme Court decision against the video streaming company Aereo Inc in concluding that Dish’s “sling” technology, which lets programs be viewed on a wide range of mobile devices, did not constitute a “public performance” that infringed Fox copyrights. However, Gee allowed Fox to pursue some claims on whether Dish violated a contract governing distribution of Fox programming.  In a statement on Tuesday, Fox spokesman Scott Grogin said the company welcomed Gee’s contract rulings, and was disappointed by her copyright findings. “This case is not, and has never been, about consumer rights or new technology,” Grogin said. “It’s always been about protecting creative works from being exploited without permission.” In a statement, Dish said it welcomed the ruling. “Consumers are the winners today, as the court sided with them on the key copyright issues in this case,” the company said. The 63-page decision is dated January 12 and had been under seal. It may narrow the remaining litigation in a 3-year-old battle in which broadcasters accused Dish of using technology that infringed copyrights, and threatened advertising revenue by letting subscribers skip over commercials. CBS Corp and Walt Disney Co’s ABC had settled similar litigation last year, as part of broader settlements allowing Dish to broadcast the networks’ programs.  Similar litigation against Dish by Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal had been put on hold pending developments in the Fox case. Fox had been scheduled to go to trial against Dish on Feb. 24, but the case has been put on hold until Oct. 1. Aereo, backed by billionaire Barry Diller, filed for bankruptcy in November after the Supreme Court effectively forbade its business model, involving the capture of programs on miniature antennas for retransmission to paying subscribers. The case is Fox Broadcasting Co et al v. Dish Network LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 12-04529.

760,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-U.S. FCC chief seeks tighter regulation of Internet providers,"(Adds specifics of plan, company comments) By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The top U.S. communications regulator on Wednesday proposed to tighten regulations on Internet service providers by treating them more like public utilities, an approach endorsed by President Barack Obama. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, in an op-ed on Wired.com, said he sought the “strongest open Internet protections ever proposed by the FCC” that would apply, for the first time, to both wireless and wired Internet services providers. The proposed rules to preserve net neutrality, the principle that all web traffic should be treated equally, would ban Internet providers from blocking or slowing down websites or charging companies for swifter delivery of their content in deals known as paid prioritization. But Wheeler also sought to address some Internet service providers’ concerns, proposing no price regulations, tariffs or requirements to give competitors access to their networks. That and the largely expected nature of the proposal prompted investors to bid up cable and telecom stocks, including Comcast Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc and Time Warner Cable. Wheeler’s latest proposal would reclassify Internet service providers as more heavily regulated “telecommunications services” under Title II of the communications law, instead of the current, more lightly regulated “information services.” Wheeler on Thursday will share his latest plan with other FCC commissioners. The five-member FCC will vote whether to enact new rules on Feb. 26. Such a change would represent a victory to smaller web companies and net neutrality activists who have argued that lack of such regulation would give unfair advantage to larger websites that can afford to pay for faster content delivery. That push has fueled widespread backlash from Internet providers, which argue that while they support net neutrality, such regulatory reclassification would impede investments and innovation. The broadband industry is expected to fight the rules in court, and Republicans in Congress are working on legislation to set net neutrality rules while restricting the FCC’s authority. Without Democrats’ support, any such legislation is expected to face Obama’s veto. Under the proposed rules, the FCC for the first time would fully apply anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules to mobile carriers alongside wired ISPs, such as cable companies. The FCC authority would also expand to previously unregulated deals that content companies, such as Netflix Inc , strike with Internet services providers on the back-end of the network, known as interconnection agreements.  The FCC would review them on a case-by-case basis. The FCC has been working on new net neutrality rules since a previous version was struck down in court in January 2014 in a case brought by Verizon. Wheeler initially proposed to allow “commercially reasonable” paid prioritization deals, which upset net neutrality advocates and helped draw more than 4 million comments from the public. Obama later sided with critics, calling in November for the “strongest possible” net neutrality rules. “We’re certainly encouraged to see that the FCC is heading in the same direction of safeguarding net neutrality with the strongest possible protections,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a press briefing on Wednesday. The debate over net neutrality has also put a sharp focus on the pending $45 billion merger of two of the largest cable companies, Comcast and Time Warner Cable. It is currently being reviewed by the FCC and Department of Justice. FCC officials on Wednesday said net neutrality rules “had nothing to do with any proposed transactions.” But UBS analysts said in a note that they would give the FCC “more than enough authority to police any negative consequences” of the merger and so lowered the regulatory review hurdle.

763,CMCSA,California Public Utilities Commission recommends to approve Comcast merger,"Feb 14 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp said on Friday that a California Public Utilities Commission Administrative (CPUC) law judge recommended  to approve its pending $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable and related transactions with Charter Communications. The approval, characterized by Comcast as an “important step” for the overall regulatory process, was proposed with a set of conditions, including making broadband available to un-served and under-served communities. Approval from California, the most populous U.S. state, is just one of a series of state and federal hurdles Comcast needs to clear to close the merger. Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen said the company was reviewing the proposed decision but that some of the recommended conditions “could prevent the full benefits of this transaction being realized by Californians, and create a more intrusive regulatory regime where innovative services could be hampered rather than helped.” In a statement, Cohen specifically cited the penetration rates and said the time frame related to making broadband more widely available to communities lacking service was “simply unattainable under market conditions.” “We look forward to working with the Commission as it creates conditions to approve this transaction that are fair to consumers in California and to our company,” he said. The overall approval of Comcast’s acquisition of Time Warner has been closely watched especially as regulators propose rules that adhere to net neutrality, or the notion that all internet providers should treat all web traffic equally. Comcast said it already has the vast majority of state and local approvals necessary to close the deal. It is working with the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice toward a close in early 2015.

Formed by the son of a Mexican immigrant in 2009, Estrella TV currently is distributed by Comcast in 16 markets on an unreimbursed, “must carry” basis under a contract that ends Thursday in Houston, Denver and Salt Lake City. The channel competes for viewers with Comcast’s Telemundo. Comcast, which also owns NBC Universal, has declined Estrella’s request to pay for its content and expand distribution to cities like Miami, with many Spanish speakers. Estrella is one of several independent programmers who have complained of being squeezed by Comcast. “They should give us increased distribution and we should get paid,” Estrella Chief Executive Officer Lenard Liberman told Reuters last week. Regulators are studying whether the proposed $45 billion merger between the two biggest U.S. cable operators would give one company too much control over what Americans watch on television and see on the Internet. Announced a year ago, the Comcast-Time Warner deal combines two companies that together would have 40 percent of the broadband market and 30 percent of the cable market. Estrella says it deserves to be paid because its ratings have gone from non-existent to respectable in just a few years. Comcast disagrees and accuses Estrella of cherry picking Nielsen data to present itself as stronger than it is. Comcast says it is in its own interest to support independent programming to make its customers happy. But it disagreed that a broadcaster that has had “must carry” status could be paid like a cable channel. “Comcast is proud to be the nation’s largest provider of Latino and multicultural television packages, with a distribution platform that delivers more than 60 Latino networks,” the company said in a statement. This dispute and others illustrate the challenges facing Comcast and Time Warner in winning approval for the merger. On Tuesday, analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson Research lowered the odds that the deal would get done. “We still believe the deal is more likely than not to be approved, but we are cutting our probability of approval (again) to 60/40,” he wrote in a research note.

767,CMCSA,"Comcast, Time Warner Cable hit with $20 billion racial bias lawsuit","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc have been sued for $20 billion for allegedly discriminating against African American-owned media and employing advocates such as the NAACP and the Rev. Al Sharpton to advance their bias. The lawsuit was filed on Friday in Los Angeles federal court by the National Association of African-American Owned Media as U.S. regulators review the proposed $45 billion merger between the two biggest U.S. cable operators. The same group filed a $10 billion lawsuit in December against AT&T; Inc and DirecTV, whose own proposed merger is also under regulatory review. According to the complaint, Comcast entered into “memoranda of understanding” with Sharpton, the NAACP and other advocacy groups to provide large cash “donations” in exchange for their not interfering with its alleged refusal to contract with African-American-owned media. The complaint said the agreements were struck after Comcast was criticized for similar failures in 2010 when it was buying part of entertainment company NBCUniversal, which it now fully owns. Sharpton and his National Action Network, the complaint said, allegedly received “over $3.8 million in ‘donations’ and as salary” for his work as an MSNBC host. The complaint also said Comcast and Time Warner Cable each have only one fully African American-owned channel, the Africa Channel, and that Time Warner Cable has acquiesced in Comcast’s discrimination in anticipation of the merger’s completion.

The owner of media and entertainment company NBCUniversal also increased its stock buyback program to $10 billion, of which it earmarked $4.25 billion for 2015, and raised its annual dividend to $1.00 per share from 90 cents. Comcast, which is awaiting approval from U.S. regulators for its $45 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable, said on Tuesday total revenue rose 4.8 percent to $17.73 billion in the quarter ended December. That was slightly higher than the $17.68 billion analysts on average had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Comcast inched up 0.6 percent to $1.93 billion, or 74 cents per share. Earnings was 77 cents per share after excluding items such as favorable income tax adjustments. Comcast added video customers for the third time in the last five quarters, picking up 6,000 new subscribers from October through December. But that was less than the 46,000 it brought in a year earlier. The number of new video subscribers is closely watched on Wall Street as pay TV operators fight to keep customers in the midst of competition from streaming video services. Comcast’s high-speed internet customers rose by 375,000, a similar gain to a year earlier. The company also added 123,000 voice customers during the quarter. At NBC Universal, revenue rose 2.3 percent to $6.62 billion, boosted by theme parks and the NBC broadcast network. While the Universal theme park in Florida lured visitors with a new Harry Potter attraction, NBC’s performance has improved with bigger audiences for shows including crime drama “The Blacklist.” Advertising revenue at cable networks dropped 5.6 percent in the quarter to $857 million amid a decline in ratings that has hit networks across the TV industry.

777,CMCSA,Rand Paul woos donors and hackers at tech conference,"AUSTIN, Tx., March 16 (Reuters) - As his likely rivals spent the weekend shaking hands in New Hampshire, potential Republican candidate Rand Paul flew to Texas to court the software developers and entrepreneurs who are likely to play a central role in the 2016 election. The libertarian-leaning Kentucky Senator tweeted, Snapchatted and Instagrammed his way through the South by Southwest Interactive conference as he sought to make inroads among an independent-minded crowd that could serve as an important source of money, votes and programming talent for his expected presidential bid. “If you want talent you gotta go where the talent is,” he said on Monday. It was the first time a potential candidate has participated in the conference, according to organizers. Paul spent much of the weekend talking about the shared DNA of the tech community and the libertarian movement, but he spent little time talking about net neutrality, the thorny question of how to ensure that all Internet traffic is treated equally. While many tech companies back recently approved rules that broadband providers such as Verizon and Comcast should be regulated like utilities, Paul and other Republicans have argued that the new regulations will choke off innovation. It’s an argument he has made in great detail in other forums. In front of this crowd, he framed the debate in the broadest terms possible. “I don’t want the government to screw up one of the greatest technologies we’ve had,” he told the conference on Sunday, drawing applause. The applause that line drew came as a surprise for tech consultant Warren Hanes, who said he thought many at the conference weren’t aware of his opposition to the new rules. “It’s possible there are people who simply responded emotionally to the issue of less regulation,” he said. Paul’s decision to spend the weekend in Texas, rather than early-voting states like Iowa or New Hampshire, highlight the crucial role the technology industry is likely to play in 2016 - both as a source of money and talent. While former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has locked down many big donors on Wall Street and Florida Senator Marco Rubio has made inroads with the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, Paul has worked hard to cultivate ties in Silicon Valley, where many entrepreneurs share his frustration with government eavesdropping. Campaigns have also engaged in a technology arms race since 2004 to find ever more sophisticated ways to target voters. Planting the flag at South by Southwest could help Paul build a cutting-edge operation. On Monday, he opened an office for his political-action committee at the Capital Factory, a shared-office space for technology startups in a downtown Austin high-rise. The tech industry gave twice as much money to Democratic President Barack Obama than his Republican rival Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. Paul’s conservative stances on social issues like gay marriage and abortion could prove troubling for many in the industry, where liberal social views are widespread. Mozilla Corp. CEO Brendan Eich, for example, resigned under pressure in 2014 after board members objected to his support for a previous campaign against gay marriage. Paul’s views on social issues are “a real problem for people like me,” said Jeff Boedeker, a producer at a multimedia company. Still, he says he believes the final say on abortion and same sex marriage will go to the courts, not the president, making support of Paul more palatable.

778,CMCSA,AT&T-DirecTV; merger escapes heat as all eyes on Comcast,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T; Inc’s proposed acquisition of satellite television company DirecTV is getting a smooth ride from U.S. regulators and industry rivals, who instead are directing their firepower at a merger deal between the nation’s two biggest cable operators. U.S. Federal Communications Commission filings and interviews with several people familiar with the Justice Department show the $48.5 billion AT&T-DirecTV; deal is getting far less attention than Comcast Corp’s agreement to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45 billion. At the core is how Comcast’s deal would bolster the company’s already dominant position in broadband Internet, an important growth area as more Americans drop cable subscriptions to watch video on the Web.       Each merger would create a company controlling more than a quarter of the pay TV market. But it is the Comcast deal that has triggered FCC and Justice Department inquiries resulting in hours-long depositions, hundreds of meetings and nearly 90,000 comments, according to disclosures and people who have met with the regulators. Muted opposition does not necessarily guarantee a painless regulatory process for AT&T; and DirecTV, but it does reduce pressure on regulators, whose bar is high for rejecting a merger, antitrust and FCC experts say.  With Time Warner Cable, Comcast would provide high-speed Internet access to almost 40 percent of Americans, according to SNL Kagan data.  Critics at advocacy groups and telecom, media and Web companies say they fear Comcast would gain unparalleled control over how content providers reach millions of pay-TV subscribers, as well as consumers’ access to video delivered by competitors over the Internet. By contrast, AT&T; covers about 17 percent of the broadband market, and DirecTV does not offer Internet access. “The customers aren’t anxious, and the competitors aren’t rattled,” said former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, now at law firm Covington & Burling. “The FCC or the Justice Department will be looking for markets where this will have an impact, and hardly anyone is telling them that there are such markets.” The FCC, which determines if deals are in the public interest, has received nearly 20 petitions to deny Comcast’s proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable, but only five such petitions for AT&T-DirecTV;, a review of disclosures shows.  The FCC has received about 14,000 “brief comments” on the AT&T; deal, many from members of the public concerned about the merger, according to a Reuters tally. On Comcast-Time Warner Cable, the agency has gotten about 88,000 such comments. FCC disclosures show officials there have held more than 300 meetings with supporters and opponents of Comcast’s proposed merger, compared with about 70 for AT&T-DirecTV.;  A critic of the AT&T-DirecTV; deal who met with the Justice Department said reviewers there asked “few questions” and gave “blank stares.”  The Justice Department, which looks at antitrust issues, and the FCC declined to comment for this story.  A Comcast spokeswoman declined to comment on comparisons with AT&T;’s merger. But she said merging with Time Warner Cable would not cause consumers to lose any video, broadband or phone choices as the two companies do not directly compete in any market. An AT&T; spokesman said the DirecTV acquisition received support from “labor, rural interests, the tech community, and many others eager for an alternative to cable.” ",3172015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-directv/att-directv-merger-escapes-heat-as-all-eyes-on-comcast-idUSKBN0MD25Y20150317

781,CMCSA,Comcast to form $4 billion investment arm with CFO at helm,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis will leave his position to head a new investment arm with up to $4.1 billion to invest in growth-oriented companies, Comcast said on Tuesday. The largest U.S. cable operator will shell out $4 billion and Angelakis will invest at least $40 million with the rest coming from senior members of a team he will appoint. Philadelphia-based Comcast, which already has a venture capital arm through Comcast Ventures, said the new company would begin operations in 2015 or early 2016. Comcast Ventures makes investments in startups in the range of $2 million to $15 million. Investments include online publisher Vox Media and e-commerce startup Birchbox. Investments made by Angelakis’ team would be in a range larger than Comcast Ventures but smaller than billion-dollar deals such as $45 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable, according to a source close to Comcast.  The new investment arm will likely identify late-stage startups and aim at “investing in and operating” them, the source said.  Technology, telecom and media companies such as Google Inc (GOOGL.O) , Verizon (VZ.N)  and Intel Corp (INTC.O) have investment arms that have invested in up-and-coming startups from healthcare to online entertainment. Industries that Comcast is looking to invest in have not been decided, the source said. Angelakis, whose resignation will be effective upon the earlier of the date on which Comcast’s new CFO commences employment or June 30, 2016, will also work with Comcast as senior adviser.  Angelakis will receive annual compensation of $8 million in his role as the CEO, Comcast said in a regulatory filing. He will also receive $100,000 for his role as senior adviser.

784,CMCSA,Charter beefs up cable muscle with Bright House deal,"(Reuters) - John Malone-backed Charter Communications Inc said it would buy Bright House Networks in a $10.4 billion deal as it expands its cable network after losing out to Comcast Corp in a fight for Time Warner Cable Inc. The U.S. cable TV industry has been rapidly consolidating in recent years to counter the growing popularity of satellite TV and Web-based entrants such as Netflix Inc. Comcast’s $45.2 billion offer for Time Warner Cable last year highlighted the changing landscape of the industry. If approved, the deal will cement Comcast’s No. 1 position and reshape the country’s pay TV and broadband markets. The Bright House deal will make Charter, in which Malone-controlled Liberty Broadband Corp is the biggest shareholder, the No. 2 U.S. cable TV provider. With Charter looking to close its gap with Comcast, the deal could be the first in a series of acquisitions. Analysts have cited Mediacom, CableOne and Suddenlink as potential targets for Charter. “I think it is inevitable most of the rest of the cable industry not owned by Comcast is sold to Charter,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak told Reuters. Wlodarczak also said Charter could go after Time Warner Cable if the Comcast deal fell through, the likelihood of which was roughly 20 percent. Charter’s shares rose as much as 8.5 percent to a record high of $199 on Tuesday. The company said it would pay Advance Newhouse — the owner of Bright House — $2 billion in cash and the rest in common and convertible preferred units of a new partnership created for the deal.   The deal will help Charter expand in Florida, a market where Bright House has a strong presence. Charter’s key markets include Alabama, Georgia, Michigan and California. Liberty Broadband said it would buy $700 million of newly issued shares of Charter.   After the deal closes, Advance Newhouse would likely own 26.3 percent of Charter and Liberty Broadband’s stake would slip to 19.4 percent. The deal is contingent on the expiration of Time Warner Cable’s “right of first offer” for Bright House, which has an agreement for sharing programming rates with the larger cable operator. Goldman Sachs and LionTree Advisors are financial advisers to Charter and UBS Investment Bank is adviser to Advance Newhouse. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is the legal adviser to Charter.

Their review could be handed in as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. (bloom.bg/1CUPx9V) The final decision would be made by senior officials. Time Warner Cable shares closed down 5.4 percent at $149.61 on the New York Stock Exchange while Comcast shares ended down 2.1 percent at $58.42 on Nasdaq. A source close to Comcast said that discussions with the DOJ had been positive and that the Federal Communications Commission was still gathering material from companies, making it early for any discussion of conditions for a deal. The FCC, which as well as the Justice Department is reviewing the deal, earlier this month paused the informal countdown toward its decision as it awaited a court ruling related to how it should handle disclosures of some documents. The FCC pause would push the conclusion of the regulatory review to the middle of the year, a Comcast executive said in a March blog post. “There is no basis for a lawsuit to block the transaction,” a Comcast spokeswoman said in an emailed statement on Friday, adding that expected benefits to both consumers and businesses from the deal “...have been essentially unchallenged in the record - and all can be achieved without any reduction of competition.” The deal has faced severe scrutiny from several media companies and executives since its initial announcement over a year ago. On Friday, a coalition of companies, associations and public interest groups sent a letter to FCC Chair Tom Wheeler opposing the merger. “The combined company would, among other things: control over half of the high-speed residential broadband connections in the United States; dominate pay-TV across the nation; combine even stronger distribution muscle with NBC-Universal’s “must-have” video programming; and control critical advertising and set-topbox inputs,” the letter stated. “... the Commission should reject this merger because it would result in too much power in the hands of one company.”   (Reporting by Malathi  Nayak and Jennifer Saba; Writing by Bernard Orr; Editing by Leslie Adler)",4172015,http://www.reuters.com/article/comcast-timewarnercable/update-2-justice-dept-staff-may-oppose-comcast-time-warner-cable-deal-bloomberg-idUSL2N0XE1OK20150417

795,CMCSA,"Comcast, Time Warner Cable to meet DoJ officials over merger: WSJ","(Reuters) - Representatives of Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N are preparing to meet U.S. Department of Justice officials to discuss competition concerns raised by the planned $45 billion merger of the two cable giants, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. The meeting next Wednesday would aim to negotiate possible concessions addressing those concerns, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. The paper said it would be the first time the two cable giants have met with regulators since announcing their proposed deal a year ago.   Staffers at both the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission remain concerned the combined company would have too much power in the Internet broadband market and would have unfair competitive leverage against TV channel owners and businesses offering online video programming, the Journal said. Representatives of the two companies and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment on the Journal report. News of the planned meeting followed a report by Bloomberg on Friday that staff attorneys at the Justice Department’s antitrust division were nearing a recommendation to block the deal.  A spokesman for Time Warner Cable questioned the Bloomberg report, saying on Friday the company had been working productively with both the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission. A source close to Comcast said on Friday that discussions with the DOJ had been positive and that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was still gathering material from companies, making it early for any discussion of conditions for a deal. The Bloomberg report said Justice Department attorneys were  citing concerns for consumers as they lean against it and their review could be handed in as soon as next week. A final decision would be made by senior officials. Time Warner Cable shares closed down 5.4 percent at $149.61 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, while Comcast shares ended down 2.1 percent at $58.42 on Nasdaq. In its report on Saturday, the Journal said the Justice Department and the FCC were nearing the final stages of scrutinizing the deal. Discussions on potential remedies to concerns would be an indication that the two agencies had not yet made a firm or final decision on the merger, the paper said. But it added the meeting could be the first of many and said it was not clear whether the companies could offer concessions that would satisfy the regulators.

The call came from Democratic Senators Al Franken, Edward Markey, Ron Wyden, Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal, alongside Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, in letters to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. “Should the transaction survive the FCC’s and DOJ’s reviews, we believe that Comcast-TWC’s unmatched power in the telecommunications industry would lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and poorer quality services for Americans,” they wrote in a rare direct call for a rejection by multiple lawmakers. The company on Tuesday pushed back against the senators’ concerns. Spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice in a statement said the benefits of the deal were “demonstrated and real,” saying they included faster Internet speeds and better video services for more consumers and better connectivity for low-income Americans. “These benefits all come with no reduction in competition for consumers,” Fitzmaurice said, citing the combined company’s expected reach of less than 30 percent of the video market and about 35 percent of broadband subscribers. Comcast officials are scheduled to discuss the proposed merger with the Department of Justice reviewers on Wednesday in the company’s latest meeting with regulators who must approve the deal.

804,CMCSA,Boutique banks to suffer most if Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal vetoed,"(Reuters) - Hints that U.S. regulators could veto Comcast Corp’s proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc have investment bankers worried about whether they will get paid, with smaller advisory firms particularly on edge. Boutique investment banks such as Allen & Company, Centerview Partners and Paul Taubman’s PJT Partners have limited resources compared to their larger brethren, and they use them to win mandates on a few big deals. Yet it is megadeals such as the Comcast-Time Warner Cable buyout, that carry the most regulatory risk. “Big banks have many deals going on, and they can afford to lose one more, even though it is painful. Smaller firms are less diversified, so for them it’s much more painful,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. At least $140 million in investment banking advisory fees are at risk if the Department of Justice ends up blocking the deal. Bloomberg News reported on Friday that staff attorneys at the department’s antitrust division were nearing a recommendation to veto the takeover because of concern about its impact on consumers. As much as $170 million in fees on two smaller transactions tied to the Time Warner buyout involving Comcast rival Charter Communications Inc may be in peril too, according to estimates by consulting firm Freeman & Co LLC. To be sure, bankers often negotiate a provision that allows them to be paid a fraction of the agreed fee if the deal falls through. These agreements are not public, but Freeman & Co estimates they amount to just 10 to 15 percent of the fee with a consummated transaction. JPMorgan Chase & Co, former top Morgan Stanley banker Taubman and Barclays, which jointly advised Comcast, would split an estimated $51 million to $68 million in advisory fees if the proposed takeover goes through, according to Freeman. Financial advisers to Time Warner Cable - Morgan Stanley , Allen & Company, Citigroup Inc and Centerview Partners - are set to share $57 million to $75 million in fees, the estimates show. Taubman finished 2014 ranked 23rd in the worldwide mergers & acquisitions league tables based on four deals, according to Thomson Reuters data. However, without Comcast, his ranking would fall out of the top 100. Centerview, which worked on 45 announced deals and was ranked 12th last year, would fall to 15th without the cable deal. If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable takeover were to be scuttled, Charter and Comcast’s three-part transaction that swaps subscribers, divests some Time Warner Cable subscribers to Charter and creates a spinoff company called GreatLand Communications, would also be scrapped. That deal would generate up to $87 million for the advisers, according to Freeman. Charter’s $10.4 billion acquisition of closely held cable provider Bright House Networks, which Freeman said could generate up to $83 million in banker fees, can also be called off if Comcast-Time Warner Cable is not approved. Time Warner Cable has a right of first offer on Bright House, and could exercise it if Comcast walked away, analysts said. Liontree and Goldman Sachs, Charter’s advisers on the Time Warner Cable asset swap and the Bright House acquisition, would see a short-term loss in fees if Comcast’s takeover of Time Warner Cable fell apart. In the long run, though, they could come out on top. Charter has been vocal about its plans to go after Time Warner Cable should it become available again - a deal that could raise fewer antitrust red flags because it would involve less market concentration than the Comcast takeover.

The recommendation, which would, in effect, put the merger in the hands of an administrative law judge, would be seen as a strong sign the FCC does not believe the deal is in the public interest, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. A hearing could be a drawn-out process, and some regulatory experts describe the procedure as a deal-killer, although Comcast would be entitled to make its case for the acquisition, the newspaper said. Comcast said in a statement that it had meetings on Wednesday with the FCC and the Justice Department, but it declined any further comment. Comcast’s merger with Time Warner Cable would combine the nation’s two largest cable companies, which do not directly compete against each other in any markets. Opponents, however, have particularly focused on the combined company’s broadband market reach, worried about its potential gatekeeping power. The FCC has to decide that the deal is in the public interest and the Justice Department has to rule that it does not harm competition for the merger to go through. Comcast has pushed back against criticisms, arguing the deal would bring faster Internet speeds and better video services to more consumers.

816,CMCSA,Comcast drops Time Warner Cable bid after antitrust pressure,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp abandoned its $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable Inc on Friday after U.S. regulators raised concerns that the deal would give Comcast an unfair advantage in the cable TV and Internet-based services market. The collapse of the deal opens the door for other possible offers for Time Warner Cable, but also casts heightened regulatory risk on merger activity in the U.S. cable industry, which has been rapidly consolidating in the face of competition from satellite TV and Web-based services.  The proposed acquisition had faced criticism from some politicians, media company executives and consumer and industry groups, who had worried it would create a monolith with too much control over what Americans do online and watch on TV. Comcast had argued the merger would bring faster service and better video services to more Americans. “The pressure to consolidate in a very competitive industry is going to continue,” Maxim Group analyst John Tinker said. Charter Communications Inc lost out on a bid for Time Warner Cable last year, and Charter’s controlling shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, had since indicated continuing interest. “We believe that TWC will get a bid from Charter in the next three months, which we expect to be lower than the market expects,” Needham analysts said in a note. The analysts said they expected the opening bid at $130 to $135 per share. Time Warner Cable shares last traded at $152.52, up 2.5 percent on the day. Comcast shares were up 0.15 percent at $59.32 and Charter shares were down 0.8 percent at $182.18. ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONCERNS The Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would have created a company controlling almost 30 percent of the U.S. pay-TV subscribers, following promised divestitures, and would have provided high-speed Internet access to almost 40 percent of Americans, according to SNL Kagan data.  Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday that the merger would have posed an “unacceptable risk to competition and innovation.” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the companies’ decision to abandon the deal was “the best outcome for American consumers.” Comcast had argued that the Time Warner Cable deal would not be anti-competitive because the companies had no real geographic overlap. The company had also proposed to divest some assets to help address regulatory concerns. The collapse of the deal is a setback for Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts. “Today, we move on,” he said in a statement.

817,CMCSA,"Collapse of Comcast cable deal may chasten Wall Street, for a while","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s failed bid to buy Time Warner Cable Inc is the latest muscle flex by U.S. antitrust enforcers and will likely deter chief executives from pursuing aggressive transactions as a way to spend excess cash. Comcast, which had barely convinced regulators to allow it to buy NBC Universal four years ago, folded under pressure from the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice and scrapped its deal to buy its No. 2 rival on Friday. It comes two months after the Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust jurisdiction with the Justice Department, sued to block Sysco Corp’s proposed deal to buy its biggest rival US Foods. A court fight is ongoing. The one-two punch from regulators shows the U.S. government is reluctant to approve deals that will take out a main rival in industries with few competitors, and could prompt companies to eye deals outside their core areas or their home markets, dealmakers say. Spencer Kurn, analyst at New Street Research, said the government sent Comcast a clear message that they are too big right now, and the company is going to be hesitant to put deals in front of regulators where they could gain scale. “Before the (Time Warner Cable) deal came about, Comcast was looking internationally and said that they hadn’t found anything attractive to them. Given the restrictions in the U.S. they are likely to resume looking internationally again,” he said.  Perceptions of a bigger regulatory threat could also make buyers more risk averse and push them to lock in stronger  protections, such as securing consent from sellers that they do not have to pay penalties if regulators shoot down a deal. Comcast, for example, has emerged relatively unscathed from the deal collapse since it does not have to pay the so-called reverse break-up fee. Meanwhile, AT&T; had to pay $6 billion in cash and assets to T-Mobile when regulators killed its planned purchase of the smaller rival in 2011.  “What’s going to happen is that Wall Street will continue to go forward with some trepidation, trying to do some big deals,” said Carl Hittinger, an antitrust expert at law firm Baker & Hostetler LLP. “People are going to hesitate.” Indeed, the abortive bid for Time Warner Cable follows the public scuttling of AT&T;’s T-Mobile bid, as well as the quiet dismissal in 2014 of ambitions by SoftBank Corp, Sprint’s owner, to buy rival T-Mobile. In that instance, SoftBank decided not to make a formal bid for T-Mobile after both FCC chairman Tom Wheeler and the Justice Department’s antitrust chief expressed skepticism about a merger between any of the top four wireless phone companies. “One lesson for everyone: Don’t get too greedy,” said a top mergers and acquisitions lawyer who asked not to be identified to protect business relationships. “If you go from having four players in the market to three players, the government is going to be tough on you.” Given a tough regulatory atmosphere, some companies are planning to hold off with aggressive deals until after the next presidential election, hopeful that a potential Republican administration will be less aggressive in blocking mergers, people familiar with the discussions said. “This is an administration that is clearly looking at things very closely,” said Mike McCormack, a managing director at Jefferies. “It does seem the administration is less friendly to big business.” Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, said that many key industries such as telecommunications and food distribution are too consolidated as a result of years of mergers and may have little space for further tie-ups. To be sure, more deals will get done than not and bankers pointed out that deals such as Comcast-Time Warner Cable and Sysco-US Foods, which would reduce the number of direct competitors in given markets, would have struggled under any administration.  Another mega deal pending regulatory review, the proposed tie-up of AT&T; and DirecTV, will likely go through, analysts and bankers say. “Outside of the fact that you are talking about two massive deals, there really aren’t any comparisons to make between the two deals. We feel fairly comfortable that the deal will get done,” Angelo Zino, analyst at S&P; Capital IQ, said of the AT&T; deal.

The S&P; 500 also hit a record intraday high for a second straight day. Amazon surged 15 percent to a lifetime high after its revenue beat estimates. Google gained 3.6 percent after reporting higher quarterly results while Microsoft jumped 9.4 percent  after it topped estimates. The S&P; hit a high of 2,120.92. The Nasdaq rose as high as 5,100.371, the highest since its intraday record of 5,132.52 in March 2000. “The difference today contrasting with back then is, you have a lot of mature companies like Microsoft, EMC and Intel that can be looked at as almost blue chip companies that pay relatively high dividends,” said James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds in New York, comparing the fresh Nasdaq highs with those in 2000, right before the Internet bubble burst. “The froth really is in social media companies and when you compare it back then, the froth was pretty much everywhere.” At 2:29 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.29 points, or 0.17 percent, to 18,088.98, the S&P; 500  gained 6.29 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,119.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.44 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,096.50. While markets are at record highs, March-quarter earnings of S&P; 500 companies are expected to dip 1.3 percent, with revenues dropping 3.5 percent as the dollar hurts U.S. multinationals and low oil prices affect energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters data. Xerox slumped as much as 14 percent to a 52-week low of $11.32 after it cut its 2015 profit forecast, blaming the strong dollar. “This is a case of the equity market looking a little bit forward to oil being less of a drag going forward, and that earnings in the second half will be better than they are now,” said Anthony Valeri, an investment strategist for LPL Financial in San Diego.

821,CMCSA,UPDATE 4-Comcast drops Time Warner Cable bid after antitrust pressure,"* DOJ, FCC say merger would have given Comcast unfair advantage * Charter offer for Time Warner cable likely - analysts * Time Warner Cable shares up 2 pct, Comcast little changed   (Adds analyst comment, context) By Devika  Krishna Kumar April 24 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp abandoned its $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable Inc on Friday after U.S. regulators raised concerns that the deal would give Comcast an unfair advantage in the cable TV and Internet-based services market. The collapse of the deal opens the door for other possible offers for Time Warner Cable, but also casts heightened regulatory risk on merger activity in the U.S. cable industry, which has been rapidly consolidating in the face of competition from satellite TV and Web-based services. The proposed acquisition had faced criticism from some politicians, media company executives and consumer and industry groups, who had worried it would create a monolith with too much control over what Americans do online and watch on TV. Comcast had argued the merger would bring faster service and better video services to more Americans. “The pressure to consolidate in a very competitive industry is going to continue,” Maxim Group analyst John Tinker said. Charter Communications Inc lost out on a bid for Time Warner Cable last year, and Charter’s controlling shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, had since indicated continuing interest. “We believe that TWC will get a bid from Charter in the next three months, which we expect to be lower than the market expects,” Needham analysts said in a note. The analysts said they expected the opening bid at $130 to $135 per share. Time Warner Cable shares last traded at $152.52, up 2.5 percent on the day. Comcast shares were up 0.15 percent at $59.32 and Charter shares were down 0.8 percent at $182.18. ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONCERNS The Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would have created a company controlling almost 30 percent of the U.S. pay-TV subscribers, following promised divestitures, and would have provided high-speed Internet access to almost 40 percent of Americans, according to SNL Kagan data. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday that the merger would have posed an “unacceptable risk to competition and innovation.” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the companies’ decision to abandon the deal was “the best outcome for American consumers.” Comcast had argued that the Time Warner Cable deal would not be anti-competitive because the companies had no real geographic overlap. The company had also proposed to divest some assets to help address regulatory concerns. The collapse of the deal is a setback for Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts. “Today, we move on,” he said in a statement.

827,CMCSA,UPDATE 3-Deal questions loom as Time Warner Cable reports subscriber uptick,"* CEO declines to answer questions about M&A; on conference call * Adds 30,000 residential video customers vs 11,800 estimate   (Adds executive comments from the call) By Subrat Patnaik and Jennifer Saba April 30 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc on Thursday reported a bigger-than-expected rise in video subscriptions for the first quarter but gave no indication of any merger deals after Comcast Corp withdrew its bid to buy the company. Since the Comcast deal was called off on Friday after U.S. regulators raised concerns, questions have arisen about whether Time Warner Cable is an acquisition target or if it would go it alone. On Monday, Reuters reported the Time Warner Cable was open to discussions with Charter Communications Inc. The future of the No. 2 U.S. cable provider is much on the minds of analysts. Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Officer Rob Marcus said in a conference call when asked about potential deals: “We’re not really going to respond to questions about any mergers and acquisitions.” The company said it added 30,000 residential video customers in the first quarter, its first increase since 2009. Analysts were expecting 11,800 subscribers.  The number of high-speed data subscribers also rose. “We feel great about the operating health of our business right now,” Marcus said. Shares of Time Warner Cable were down 0.6 percent at $156.98 in morning trading. “Time Warner Cable is unmistakably investing for growth,  and that has to raise questions about whether they would be willing to sell to Charter after all,” MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said. Time Warner Cable said it expected 2015 operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding special items, to be flat this year. Analysts also wondered whether Time Warner Cable would follow Verizon Communications Inc’s lead and start to offer smaller bundles to its customers, rather than traditional packages stuffed with hundreds of channels. Chief Operating Officer Dinesh Jain said there was still a lot of value in the triple-play package of video, broadband and landline services. “In terms of skinny packages, we don’t want to be pioneers on that,” he said. Net income attributable to the company fell to $458 million, or $1.59 per share, in the quarter from $479 million, or $1.70 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $1.87 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to almost 3.5 percent to $5.78 billion, below the analysts’ average estimate of $5.83 billion.

830,CMCSA,"Comcast profit beats estimates on internet, enterprise growth","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable operator, posted better-than-expected first-quarter profit, driven by strong growth in its high-speed Internet and business services. Comcast’s shares were up about 2 percent in pre-market trading on Monday morning after closing at $58.41 on Friday on the Nasdaq. Comcast, which increased its stock buyback program to $10 billion last quarter, said it would now earmark $6.75 billion for 2015, higher than the $4.25 billion it had previously set aside for the year. Comcast, which abandoned its proposed $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc in late April, said on Monday its total revenue rose 2.6 percent to $17.9 billion in the quarter ended March 31.

835,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-Netflix asks U.S. FCC to reject AT&T-DirecTV; merger unless changes made,"(Recasts with statement on Tuesday from Netflix spokeswoman) By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, May 5 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc has urged the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to reject the pending $48 billion merger of AT&T; Inc and DirecTV unless its concerns about the deal are addressed. A Netflix spokeswoman said on Tuesday that the video streaming company does not oppose the merger in principle but is  rather seeking remedies that would help resolve its competitive concerns. “While we are participating in the government’s review, we are not opposing the merger,” the spokeswoman, Anne Marie Squeo, said in a statement. “We’ve been highlighting concerns about AT&T;’s broadband practices and the need for appropriate remedies since last September.” According to regulatory disclosures posted on Tuesday, Netflix representatives met recently with more than 20 FCC officials and raised concerns about the combined company’s gatekeeping power as it would become the country’s largest pay-TV provider with potentially expansive broadband reach. Though the filing does not amount to a formal “petition to deny” the merger, it marks the strongest language yet from Netflix on the proposed merger of the No. 2 wireless carrier and the largest U.S. satellite-TV company. Previous FCC filings from Netflix on the deal called for approval with conditions. “The combination of these companies would increase the incentive and ability to limit competition and innovation in the online video space,” Squeo said. Netflix’s April 30 meeting with the FCC’s merger reviewers came just days after the agency’s strong opposition helped thwart another mega-deal between the two largest U.S. cable providers, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc . The growing online video and over-the-top video markets became a critical issue in the review of that merger, fueled by heated opposition from Netflix, Dish Network Corp, some media companies and public interest groups.

837,CMCSA,Cablevision shares jump after CEO says interested in 'deal',"(Reuters) - Shares of Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N jumped as much as 8 percent after Chief Executive James Dolan said he would be interested in a “deal” with Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N, Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and other cable operators. Consolidation in the New York cable TV marketplace would provide a “great deal of ingenuity and much more access to resources for the customers and lower prices,” Dolan said on Wednesday. He was speaking in Chicago at the Internet & Television Expo, a trade industry show formerly known as The Cable Show. Cablevision, controlled by New York’s Dolan family, operates primarily in the Greater New York area. The U.S. cable industry has been rapidly consolidating as it faces rising popularity of satellite TV and increasing competition from online video-streaming companies such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). Cablevision said last week it would offer Hulu’s video streaming service to customers under its Optimum plans. The company had said in March it would offer HBO’s standalone streaming service, HBO Now, to its Optimum Online internet customers.  Dolan said he was not interested in a deal with Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ.N) FiOS TV and internet service. CBS Corp’s (CBS.N) Sports Network joined Verizon’s FiOS’s new Custom TV lineup under its sports package, a Verizon spokesman told Reuters last week.  Cablevision shares were up 3percent at $20.97 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. The shares touched a high of $21.91, a level they have reached only the second time in the last three-and-a-half years.

839,CMCSA,Exclusive: Bright House Networks plans to drop merger with Charter - sources,"(Reuters) - Bright House Networks, the sixth largest U.S. cable operator, is preparing to abandon a $10.4 billion deal to be acquired by larger peer Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O), according to people familiar with the matter. Charter, the No. 4 U.S. cable operator, clinched the deal with Bright House in March contingent on completion of Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) $45.2 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N. Comcast walked away from the Time Warner Cable deal last month because of antitrust hurdles. Charter’s agreement with Bright House includes a 30-day provision for them to renegotiate a deal in this event. That period lapses in about two weeks. Even though negotiations are still formally continuing, Bright House, which is controlled by the Newhouse family, owner of magazine publisher Conde Nast, now believes it best to remain independent, the people said this week. Time Warner Cable has an agreement to negotiate programing rates for Bright House, as well as share technology, in exchange for a fee. Bright House would rather not change this arrangement by partnering with Charter, which is a smaller operator than Time Warner Cable, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Bright House Networks, Charter and Time Warner Cable representatives declined to comment. Last week, Charter Chief Executive Tom Rutledge said on the company’s earnings call he was negotiating with Bright House “in good faith.” Time Warner Cable has the right of first refusal in the event Bright House pursues a sale. The U.S. cable TV industry has been rapidly consolidating in recent years to counter the growing popularity of satellite TV and Web-based entrants such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). The Bright House deal would have made Charter, whose biggest shareholder is John Malone’s Liberty Broadband Corp, the No. 2 U.S. cable TV provider. It would have helped Charter expand in Florida, a market where Bright House has a strong presence. Charter’s key markets include Alabama, Georgia, Michigan and California. Charter is now in negotiations to acquire Time Warner Cable, people familiar with the matter have previously said. Time Warner Cable’s deal with Comcast fell through after U.S. regulators raised concerns that it would give Comcast an unfair advantage in the cable TV and Internet-based services market. Charter last week reported a first-quarter net loss of $81 million, or 73 cents per share, up from $37 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.

840,CMCSA,Comcast names Carlyle Group's Michael Cavanagh as CFO,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) on Monday named Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) Co-President Michael Cavanagh as chief financial officer, bringing on a prominent dealmaker after its failed attempt to acquire Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N.   The appointment, which takes effect in early summer, is a blow to Carlyle. The private equity firm had hired Cavanagh just last year from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), where he was seen a potential successor to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. Cavanagh, 49, replaces Michael Angelakis, who Comcast said in March would head its investment arm scheduled to start operations in 2015 or early 2016 with up to $4.1 billion to invest in growth-oriented companies. Glenn Youngkin, Cavanagh’s fellow co-president and co-chief operating officer at Carlyle, will assume sole responsibility of these roles. Carlyle has no immediate plans to replace Cavanagh, according to a person briefed on the matter and not authorized to discuss it publicly. Cavanagh is the second top executive to leave Carlyle in as many years. Last year, CFO Adena Friedman returned to NASDAQ OMX Group Inc (NDAQ.O) after three years at Carlyle to become the market exchange operator’s president.  “We see Cavanagh’s departure highlighting the cultural risk at Carlyle,” JPMorgan equity analysts wrote in a note. “Our expectation was that Cavanagh would bring big-company management to Carlyle, which is growing into a big company.” Carlyle is run by its founders, David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D’Aniello. Before joining Carlyle, Cavanagh was co-head of JPMorgan’s corporate and investment bank. He also had been the bank’s CFO for six years. Cavanagh will receive a base salary of $1.8 million for 2015 plus a cash bonus of up to four times that amount, Comcast said in a regulatory filing. He is also entitled to an additional incentive package of up to $22.5 million, the filing said.

852,CMCSA,RPT-Charter's Time Warner Cable bid faces $2 billion regulatory question,"(Repeats for more subscribers; no change to text) By Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, May 26 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable, entering into talks to be acquired by  Charter Communications Inc just a month after regulators killed a proposed takeover by Comcast Corp’s, was determined not to get burned a second time. It won such an insurance policy on Tuesday, when Charter included as part of its $56 billion takeover agreement a pledge to pay Time Warner Cable a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal goes south. Comcast, by contrast, had made no such pledge and was able to walk away scot-free when its bid collapsed. Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Rob Marcus said in an interview that the company had more leverage to negotiate various terms of the deal with Charter because it was a competitive process. Reuters reported that French telecom company Altice had been in talks about buying the company as well. Time Warner Cable’s insistence on a breakup fee reflects lingering worries that the Federal Communications Commission, which rejected the Comcast deal over concerns about its broadband market reach and the future of online video, could do something similar in this case. Charter, meanwhile, was willing to pledge $2 billion because it is confident the deal will go through and it ultimately won’t have to pay the fee, according to people close to the company who declined to speak on the record. Underscoring the high stakes involved, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler issued an unusually quick statement when the new deal was announced on Tuesday, reiterating that the agency will review the deal to determine whether it is in the public interest. “In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient,” Wheeler said. “The Commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved.” While one FCC official noted that “absolutely nothing about this transaction has been pre-judged” and other experts warned against reading any implicit indications of opinion in the comment, some insiders saw Wheeler’s statement as a reason for concern. “That’s a shot across the bow,” said one antitrust expert and former FCC official, who asked not to be identified to protect business relationships. “If I were the parties, I wouldn’t like that statement.” Although the FCC and the Department of Justice will both review the merger proposal, the former will present a higher hurdle for Charter because of its broad public interest standard. The Justice Department reviews deals’ antitrust impact and has to prove actual harm to consumers to stop a merger. One issue of concern for regulators is whether the combination of Charter and Time Warner Cable will result in higher prices for cable and broadband, said Gene Kimmelman, a veteran of the Justice Department who is now president of the public interest group Public Knowledge. “It will get a hard look and it will depend on whether they will work out conditions,” he said, adding that conditions usually can be worked out in such deals. Other industry analysts said Charter’s deal would be viewed as less risky than that of Comcast because of its relatively smaller scale and lack of major content assets like Comcast’s NBC Universal. “This is a qualitatively different deal,” said Adonis Hoffman, former chief of staff to FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and founder of Business in the Public Interest think tank. Charter kicked off a charm offensive in the deal’s favor on Tuesday, pledging to invest more in faster broadband, public WiFi networks and high-speed Internet connections for small and medium-sized businesses. It also promised more affordable telephone service and better video products, including high definition channels. Still, Charter will face tough questions on the U.S. broadband Internet market, of which the combined companies would control more than one-fifth, according to data from research firm MoffettNathanson. Wheeler said the FCC’s review of a possible Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination led regulators to begin to consider cable companies less as traditional pay-TV providers and more as Internet service providers. The regulators are likely to seek reassurances that the new company would not harm the growing online content competition, for instance by charging high fees for access to its network, experts say. Charter currently does not charge such fees. “One of the biggest questions about Charter and Time Warner Cable is whether the deal is in the public interest. Frankly, we’re skeptical,” said Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports. “Prices for cable and broadband continue to go up, and customer service is dismal.” And, as with any cable or Internet deal, regulators will look to see if Charter and Time Warner systems overlap, and require asset sales in areas where they do before approving any deal. Both Time Warner Cable and Charter are strongest along the eastern United States with a smattering of customers in Texas and California, although they directly compete in few, if any of those markets.

865,CMCSA,"Dear customers: That Minion isn't cursing. Sincerely, McDonald's","(Editor’s Note: Please be advised that paragraph 2 contains language that some readers may find offensive) By Ben Klayman July 10 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp is standing by its latest Happy Meal toy, denying that its Minions are the foul-mouthed playthings that some of its fast-food customers say they are. In videos posted online, some customers said they heard a curse when, by tapping one of the tiny plastic caveman characters against a hard surface, they activated its voice. Some commenters wrote they heard the words: “What the fuck.” “To me, it sure doesn’t sound like anything a kid should be hearing,” one commenter said on a YouTube video post. The restaurant chain on July 3 introduced a Happy Meal line of the toys inspired by the animated film “Minions,” a prequel to the “Despicable Me” movies that feature the small, yellow, gibberish-talking characters. In a statement, McDonald’s denied the toy used bad language, and a company spokeswoman said there was no plan to pull the toy from distribution. “We’re aware of a very small number of customers who have been in touch regarding this toy, and we regret any confusion or offense to those who may have misinterpreted its sounds,” McDonald’s said in the statement. “The allegation that this toy is saying anything offensive or profane is not true.” McDonald’s said the Minion Caveman toy emits three sounds - “para la bukay,” “hahaha” and “eh eh.” “Minions,” which opened in the United States on Friday, was made by Universal Pictures, which is owned by Comcast Corp, and Illumination Entertainment. A spokeswoman for Universal declined comment, referring questions to McDonald’s.

An official title for the sequel and the director have yet to be announced. “Jurassic World,” co-produced with Legendary Pictures, exceeded early expectations to achieve the largest opening weekend in movie history with $524.1 million at the global box office. The film added to an already stellar year for Universal Pictures, which became the fastest studio to hit $2 billion at the box office in a calendar year last month, buoyed by the success of February’s “Fifty Shades of Grey,” April’s “Furious 7” and May’s “Pitch Perfect 2.” In its earnings report on Thursday, Comcast said revenue at the film studio rose 93 percent from a year earlier to $2.3 billion, bolstered by “Furious 7” and “Jurassic World.” Upcoming Universal movies this year include M Night Shyamalan’s horror “The Visit,” drama “Everest,” Aaron Sorkin’s “Steve Jobs” biopic and Guillermo Del Toro’s gothic horror “Crimson Peak.”    (Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Mary Milliken, Lisa Von Ahn and Marguerita Choy)",7232015,http://www.reuters.com/article/film-jurassicworld/update-1-universal-pictures-jurassic-world-sequel-set-for-june-2018-idUSL1N1032IF20150723

Comcast, also the No.1 U.S. high-speed Internet provider, said on Thursday total revenue rose 11.3 percent to $18.74 billion in the second quarter ended June 30. Analysts on average had forecast revenue of $18.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

881,CMCSA,Shyamalan creeps into micro-budget horror with 'The Visit',"LOS ANGELES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Nana and Pop Pop seem like the perfect grandparents. They bake cookies, go for long walks and volunteer at a local psychiatric hospital. But after the sun goes down, things get weird in M. Night Shyamalan’s latest horror movie, “The Visit.” The film, out in theaters on Friday, follows teen siblings Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) as they are sent by their single mother to meet her estranged parents for the first time and stay with them for a week. Shyamalan, 45, known for supernatural movies such as “The Sixth Sense” and “Signs,” channels his own teen filmmaker self into the precocious Becca, an aspiring documentarian who films everything during their visit, including the bizarre behavior of her grandparents as night falls. The film was written, directed and produced by Shyamalan on a micro-budget of under $5 million. He partnered with horror producer Jason Blum and Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures for distribution. “I love constraints, both financially and creatively,” Shyamalan told Reuters. “Passive entertainment, where you do everything for the audience, is not what interests me. I want you to fill in gaps ... the budget helps you think like that.” The film has earned mixed reviews and is projected by BoxOffice.com to open with $17 million this weekend. “The Visit” follows Shyamalan’s first foray into television as the executive producer of Fox’s 10-part summer sci-fi mystery thriller “Wayward Pines.” The hit TV show, set in a town shrouded from the outside world, “directly affected ‘The Visit’ and how I shot it,” Shyamalan said, referring to the faster pace and smaller budgets of working in television. “It really taught me what’s important and how to get the things out of the actors fast and really concentrate,” Shyamalan said. “What it did for me is tell me how lazy I had become as a filmmaker.” “The Visit” marks the Philadelphia filmmaker’s return to the big screen after films that failed to spark up critics or box office, such as 2008’s supernatural “The Happening” and 2013’s  sci-fi movie “After Earth.” Shyamalan dismissed those lackluster performances and said he was focusing on bringing a refreshed self to movies and TV. “The whole point is to make different movies, make genre-bending movies,” he said. “It’s all about ‘Wayward Pines’ and ‘The Visit’ right now, that’s where my tonality is right now, dark humor and mysterious.”   (Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy, editing by Jill Serjeant and Nick Zieminski)",9112015,http://www.reuters.com/article/film-thevisit/shyamalan-creeps-into-micro-budget-horror-with-the-visit-idUSL1N11H02920150911

Trump, who coined the catch phrase “You’re fired,” stepped down from the show earlier this year because he decided to run as Republican candidate for U.S. president in 2016. He is currently leading opinion polls. Schwarzenegger said he was a huge fan of ‘The Celebrity Apprentice’ and “the way it showcases the challenges and triumphs of business and teamwork. I am thrilled to bring my experience to the boardroom and to continue to raise millions for charity.” The Austrian-born action hero and former bodybuilder has released a handful of movies since returning to the entertainment industry, but few have had the box office success he enjoyed in the 1980s and 1990s with films like “Conan the Barbarian” and “The Terminator.” His latest outing “Terminator: Genisys,” released in July, brought in a disappointing $90 million at the North American box office but fared much better overseas with about $350 million, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com    ",9142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nbc-celebrity-apprenctice/schwarzenegger-to-replace-trump-as-host-of-the-celebrity-apprentice-idUSKCN0RE1TO20150914

886,CMCSA,Comcast creates new enterprise services unit to target big businesses,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp has set up a new business services division to sell broadband, Wi-Fi, ethernet and other services to large companies in the Fortune 1000 list, hoping to attract new revenue, the U.S. cable and Internet provider said on Wednesday.  The new “Enterprise Services” unit will be under the company’s Comcast Business division, which currently offers services to small-to-medium businesses, Comcast said in a statement. Comcast Business is now targeting companies with large revenue figures and is taking on rivals in the business services market, such as wireless companies AT&T; and Verizon Communications Inc. Unlike residential customers who may switch to satellite or telephone players, businesses typically sign long-term contracts, bringing in steady sales. Moreover, the push to grab more business clients reflects how cable companies are searching for new growth as their traditional business, selling TV services to residential clients, matures.  Over the last six to nine months, Comcast has signed up 25 to 30 customers with $45 million in contracts, Bill Stemper, president of Comcast Business, said in an interview. Big banks are part of the list, he said without providing details.  Comcast, the largest U.S. cable operator, reported business services revenue, which includes sales to companies of broadband Internet, voice lines and network services, of $4 billion in 2014, up 22 percent from a year earlier. Its cable business was up 1.2 percent last year to $20.8 billion. “We have that $1 billion mark in our mind” for the new enterprise services unit, Stemper said. “In five to six years (the unit) should be starting to get to that level.” Comcast, which offers services in 39 states and the District of Columbia, will serve business customers in areas where it is absent, such as Los Angeles and New York City, through partnerships with other Internet providers such as Time Warner Cable and Cox Communications, Stemper said.

892,CMCSA,Comcast buys majority stake in Universal Studios Japan for $1.5 billion,"OSAKA (Reuters) - Comcast Corp said it will buy a majority stake in Universal Studios Japan for $1.5 billion, its biggest investment outside the United States and part of an aggressive expansion of its theme park business globally. Propelled by the huge popularity of Harry Potter attractions, its Universal Studios parks have become a core growth business for Comcast, which saw its $45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc fail on antitrust concerns this year. In addition to further investments undertaken at its U.S. parks, the No. 1 U.S. cable company is also planning a theme park in Beijing as well as an indoor theme park in Moscow. “We will make more investments - not only Osaka but also other areas,” Chief Executive Brian Roberts told a news conference. Comcast, which owns Universal Studios and Universal Theme Parks through its NBCUniversal unit, said it will buy 51 percent of USJ Co, the holding company for the theme park operator, from Goldman Sachs, Seoul-based private equity firm MBK and other owners. The deal gives USJ an enterprise value of $6.2 billion, Comcast said. Goldman Sachs, MBK and other current owners will retain an interest in the Japanese theme park operator. Thanks to its “Wizarding World of Harry Potter” attraction, which opened in July last year, annual visitors jumped by a fifth to a record 12.7 million visitors in the last financial year. Tokyo’s Disney Resort, which includes Disneyland and DisneySea, also had a record year with 31.4 million visitors though its growth was just 0.3 percent.  Roberts said that while a deal had only been finalised in the last few weeks, it had been on the company’s radar since its 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal. USJ had planned a Tokyo listing this year, but it was shelved due to concerns that three IPOs for Japan Post group companies in November worth a combined $11.5 billion would saturate the market, two sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.  Roberts said there were no plans for an IPO in the near term, although its new board would revisit the idea. The Osaka theme park opened in 2001 and listed on the Tokyo bourse’s Mothers Market for start-ups in 2007. Struggling with falling visitor numbers, it was delisted two years later and sold to a consortium led by Goldman Sachs. Media have reported that USJ is planning a new theme park on the Japanese southern island of Okinawa.

896,CMCSA,Fitch Affirms Comcast's IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) assigned to Comcast Corporation (Comcast) and its wholly owned  subsidiaries included in Comcast's cross-guaranty structure. Fitch has also  affirmed the 'A-' IDR assigned to NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. (NBCUniversal  Enterprise) and to NBCUniversal Media, LLC. (NBCUniversal) The Rating Outlook on  all of these ratings is Stable. Approximately $49.3 billion of Comcast's consolidated debt, including $9.2  billion outstanding at NBCUniversal and $4 billion outstanding at NBCUniversal  Enterprise as of June 30, 2015, is affected by Fitch's action. KEY RATING DRIVERS Consistent Capital Structure Policy: Comcast's capital structure and financial  strategy remains balanced between investing in its businesses, reducing leverage  to its target range of between 1.5x-2x, and returning excess capital to  shareholders.  Significant Financial Flexibility: Fitch believes Comcast's strong operating  profile and solid free cash flow (FCF) metrics afford the company a high degree  of financial flexibility at the current rating category. Comcast generated  approximately $7.8 billion of FCF during the LTM period ended June 30, 2015.  Going forward Fitch anticipates the company will consistently generate  consolidated FCF in excess of $7 billion. Consistent Capital Allocation Strategy: Comcast's capital allocation policy is  expected to remain relatively consistent and focused on returning capital to its  shareholders while continuing to invest in the strategic needs of its business.  Fitch expects that share repurchases will total approximately $6.75 billion  during 2015, in line with management guidance. Leading Market Positions: Fitch's ratings incorporate Comcast's strong  competitive position as one of the largest video, high-speed data and phone  providers to residential and business customers in the U.S. and the company's  compelling subscriber clustering profile with operations in 39 states and the  District of Columbia. In Fitch's view, NBCUniversal's size, scale, leading brand  positions and diversity of operations and business risk, and position as one of  the world's most prominent media and entertainment companies, lowers the  business risk attributable to Comcast's credit profile. The company also creates  new avenues for revenue and cash flow growth while limiting the impact on  Comcast's balance sheet and credit profile. Strength of Cable Networks: NBCUniversal's portfolio of leading cable networks  as well as the growing importance of its theme parks business are key  considerations supporting our ratings and are a strength of the company's credit  profile. Fitch considers cable networks one of the strongest subsectors in the  media and entertainment industry, which provides NBCUniversal with a revenue  base largely consisting of stable, recurring and high-margin affiliate fee  revenue generated from multichannel video programming distributors as well as  being a significant source of NBCUniversal's FCF generation. International Parks Investment:  The affirmation incorporates the company's  decision to purchase a 51% ownership stake in Universal Studios Japan (USJ) for  approximately $1.5 billion.  USJ's current ownership, consisting of Goldman  Sachs, MBK Partners, Owl Creek Asset Management and current management, retain a  49% stake in the company.  The investment marks a shift in Comcast's  asset-light, licensing fee model for its international parks businesses.   Furthermore, the investment presents an opportunity to geographically diversify  its operating profile and leverage the growth and return on investment Universal  Studios has captured in domestic markets.  Evolving Competitive Environment: Fitch believes that over-the-top (OTT) can  become a persistent, long-term drag on the pay-television sector.  The internet  is becoming another platform to distribute video content. Fitch expects that OTT  will have a broad impact on the sector affecting the size of pay-television and  cable network subscriber bases, advertising and affiliate fee revenues, and  programming costs.  However, in Fitch's view, OTT and its impact on  pay-television subscriber base will not materially affect Comcast's operating or  credit profile over the current ratings horizon.  Comcast has sufficient  flexibility within the current ratings to withstand modest subscriber losses due  to cord cutting.  That said, however the largest offset to the threat of OTT to  Comcast's cable business is that regardless of how a subscriber consumes video  content - through the internet or with a traditional video service - the  subscriber will still need to pay for network access (video or high-speed data  service).     LEVERAGE AND FINANCIAL POLICY Comcast's leverage metric through the LTM period ended June 30, 2015 was 2x, a  modest improvement from 2.1x as of year-end 2014. Fitch believes Comcast's  credit profile will be relatively consistent during 2015 and that leverage will  approximate 2x as of year-end 2015 and remain within the higher end of the  company's leverage target during the current ratings horizon.  Total debt  outstanding as of June 30, 2015 was approximately $49.3 billion, relatively  unchanged compared with year-end 2014 and a modest 1.4% increase relative to  year-end 2013.  Fitch's expectation that shareholder returns as a percentage of pre-dividend  cash flow will increase during the ratings horizon is incorporated into the  ratings.  Comcast returned approximately $4.8 billion of capital to its  shareholders through the year-to-date period ended June 30, 2015 in the form of  dividends and share repurchases reflecting an 84.5% increase compared to the  same period last year.  Shareholder returns during 2015 represented  approximately 93.1% of cash flow before dividends.  Approximately $6.4 billion  of share repurchase capacity remains under the current authorization as of June  30, 2015. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Reflecting the overall maturity of Comcast's services, Fitch's base case  assumes overall primary service unit (PSU) additions continue to slow,  reflecting increasing penetration of the company's service offering portfolio.   Importantly, Fitch believes that video service subscriber losses will continue  to moderate over the forecast period.  High-speed data subscriber growth remains  in mid-single digits while telephony subscriber growth is in low single digits.   --Comcast's cable business will continue to report low- to mid-single-digit  revenue growth during the forecast period as service ARPUs continue to grow in  light of the favorable revenue mix shift of subscribers taking more advanced  video services and higher speed (higher-priced) high-speed data service tiers as  well as increased overall service penetration.   --Cable segment margins decline modestly during the forecast period reflecting  ongoing programming cost increases.  The increased costs are offset somewhat by  Comcast's ability to shift its revenue mix to higher margin services such as  high-speed data services and commercial services, as well as improving  operational efficiencies.   --Cable segment capital intensity remains relatively consistent over the near  term before moderating somewhat as the deployment of the X1 platform and related  cloud DVR and wireless gateway spending winds down.   --Soft advertising market continues throughout the rating horizon forecast with  base advertising revenues flat to down 1% excluding political and Olympic  related spending.   --Mid-single-digit affiliate fee revenue growth within NBCU's cable network  segment  --NBCU's broadcast segment benefits from strong retransmission and reverse  compensation revenue growth.   --Theme park revenue growth is assumed at mid-single digits following the launch  of the Harry Potter attraction during 2014 and 2015. --Fitch's base case assumes no change in Comcast's financial policy or capital  allocation strategy.  In line with company guidance, we expect Comcast will  repurchase $6.75 billion of its common stock during 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action would likely coincide with Comcast committing to and  achieving a financial policy consistent with an 'A' rating, including  maintaining its leverage below 1.5x on a sustained basis. Comcast would need to  demonstrate that its operating profile will not materially decline in the face  of competition.  Negative rating actions would likely coincide with discretionary actions of  Comcast's management including, but not limited to, adopting a more aggressive  financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition activity that drive  leverage beyond 2.5x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan. LIQUIDITY Comcast's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility are strong based  on Fitch's expectation that the company will continue to generate material  amounts of FCF. Comcast generated approximately $7.8 billion of FCF during the  LTM ended June 30, 2015. Going forward, Fitch anticipates that the company will  consistently generate consolidated FCF in excess of $7 billion. Fitch acknowledges that Comcast's share repurchase program represents a  significant use of cash. However, Fitch believes the company would reduce the  level of share repurchases should the operating environment materially change,  in order to maximize financial flexibility.  The liquidity position is further supported by cash on hand (which totaled  approximately $3.5 billion on a consolidated basis as of June 30, 2015) and $7.4  billion of collective available borrowing capacity (as of June 30, 2015) from  Comcast's two revolving credit facilities. Commitments under Comcast's $6.25  billion revolver will expire during June 2017, while the commitments related to  NBCUniversal Enterprise's $1.35 billion revolver expire during March 2018. The  credit facilities provide a liquidity back-stop to the company's two commercial  paper (CP) programs.  Comcast maintains a $6.25 billion CP program (no  outstanding amount as of June 30, 2015) while NBCUniversal Enterprise has  established a $1.35 billion CP program under which approximately $705 million  was outstanding as of June 30, 2015. Comcast's debt maturity profile is well-laddered and within Fitch's FCF  expectation. The company does not have any scheduled maturities during the  remainder of 2015 excluding outstanding CP, followed by $2.5 billion, $2.6  billion and $4.1 billion during 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

899,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-Dish Networks petitions FCC to deny Time Warner-Charter merger,"(Adds comment from Charter, NAB’s petition against deal) Oct 13 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp said on Tuesday it filed a petition asking the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deny the proposed merger of Charter Communications Inc and Time Warner Cable, citing substantial harm to competitors and consumers. The petition said that the proposed deal would be no better for the public interest than the one proposed between Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. Dish said that a Time Warner-Charter merger would result in two broadband providers, the other being Comcast, controlling about 90 percent of U.S. high-speed broadband networks. Dish also quoted Sling TV Chief Executive Roger Lynch, who said the proposed merger would harm other emerging competitive online video products and services, and also affect the performance of traditional satellite television service, ultimately reducing competition and choice for consumers. “There is no more friendly broadband provider to Sling than Charter. Charter’s slowest speed is 60 Mbps, we have no data caps, no contracts and modem fees,” Charter spokesman Justin Venech said. Time Warner declined to comment. National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), a trade group of TV broadcasters, filed a petition against the deal at the FCC on Monday. Time Warner shareholders on Sept. 21 approved the company’s $56 billion takeover by Charter Communications. Charter said in May that it would buy Time Warner in a cash-and-stock deal that would make it the No. 2 U.S. Internet and cable company after Comcast.

901,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-Dish to test automated TV ad sales,"(Adds detail on Dish’s ad inventory and household reach) By Malathi Nayak NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp will begin experimenting with automated ad sales, moving away from the pay-TV industry’s years-old way of selling ads through phone calls, paperwork and in-person deal-making. Dish will open up a digital ad market to let advertisers buy linear television ads as a beta test before officially launching at a later date, the company said in a statement on Monday. “We’re bringing the ease of digital ad buying to the TV marketplace,” Adam Gaynor, vice president of media sales and analytics at Dish, said in an interview. Dish will work with ad-buying firms Rocket Fuel, TubeMogul and DataXu, the company said. Automated or programmatic ad technology allows each ad impression to be offered up by sellers on a digital ad exchange and buyers make real-time bids based on data about individuals they aim to target. Television still represents the largest slice of advertising revenue but digital advertising is growing quickly. Advertisers are expected to spend $70.6 billion this year on TV and $58.6 billion on digital media including mobile, according to research firm eMarketer. As more eyeballs shift to online video on digital services and advertisers get used to the flexibility of buying, selling and placing digital ads on the fly, the pay-TV industry is under pressure to follow suit. “Our goal is to go get online (advertising) budgets,” Gaynor said. Pay-TV providers collect customer data through set-top boxes. Dish’s automated ad market can reach 8 million households with set-top boxes that record data useful for targeted advertising. Dish will use 80 specifications like age, gender, and education and plans to bring in more data sets, Gaynor said. Dish’s set-top boxes record whether the ad ran on the TV set or was skipped which is feedback for advertisers, Gaynor said. Digital ads can be placed instantly. Television ads can be bought in real-time but it takes a couple of days to be slotted into programming, he added. Late last year, Walt Disney Co’s ESPN experimented with programmatic ad auctions for its SportsCenter show. Disney’s ABC and Comcast Corp’s NBC have tested programmatic ad-buying on their online video offerings. Pay-TV providers have access to two minutes per hour of ad time in local programming. While ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox and their affiliates sell ad slots independently, commercials from Dish’s ad inventory can run on channels such as the Food Network, Gaynor said.

902,CMCSA,"Comcast posts in-line results, helped by 'Minions,' Internet unit growth","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the cable and entertainment company, posted in-line third-quarter results on Tuesday, helped by its NBCUniversal’s box-office hit “Minions” and growth in its high-speed Internet and business services divisions. Comcast, which is both the largest U.S. cable operator and the No. 1 U.S. high-speed Internet provider, reported total revenue rose 11.2 percent to $18.7 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average had forecast revenue of $18.03 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Comcast fell 23 percent to $2 billion, or 80 cents per share, from a year earlier. Excluding items such as tax adjustments and acquisition-related items, profit was up 9.6 percent from a year ago, also at 80 cents per share, matching Wall Street estimates.  The company said 48,000 video subscribers departed from July through September, an improvement over a year earlier when it lost 81,000 users.  As viewers gravitate toward online video offerings, pay-TV operators are battling streaming video services from Netflix Inc and Hulu for subscribers.  Comcast has been enhancing features of its X1 set-top box and improving customer service in a bid to retain pay-TV subscribers. To gauge the appetite for online video, it is beta-testing an ad-supported short-form video service called “Watchable” targeting millenials and also plans to introduce a comedy-centric $3.99-a-month streaming service, called “Seeso.”  Revenue from Comcast’s high-speed Internet business rose about 10 percent to $3.1 billion in the quarter, and Internet customer additions rose 1.5 percent to 320,000. Business services revenue jumped 19.5 percent to $1.21 billion. At NBCUniversal, revenue grew 21 percent to $7.15 billion from a year earlier. Revenue at the film studio climbed 64 percent from a year earlier to $2 billion, boosted by the blockbuster film “Minions,” which crossed $1 billion in revenue. The Universal theme park business, with its popular “Harry Potter” attraction in Florida, saw revenue increase 14.1 percent to $458 million. Last month, Comcast said it would buy a majority stake in Universal Studios Japan for $1.5 billion, as it expands its theme park business globally.

906,CMCSA,Fox Business plan for U.S. Republican debate: stick to money issues,"(Reuters) - During the next U.S. Republican presidential debate on Tuesday, Fox Business Network aims to keep the candidates talking about economic issues and avoid the criticism leveled at rival CNBC that it failed to keep the focus on substance. The stakes are high for Fox Business, a younger and smaller cable channel to CNBC that has a chance to attract new viewers from the millions likely to tune in for its first debate in the November 2016 presidential election.  “For Fox Business, this is an important rite of passage,” Neil Cavuto, the network’s managing editor of business news, said in an interview this week. “I don’t want to screw it up.”     Cavuto and Fox’s Maria Bartiromo will moderate the prime-time debate with eight top-polling candidates alongside Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief Gerard Baker. Fox Business is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, and the Wall Street Journal is a unit of Murdoch’s News Corp. Moderators for CNBC, the top-rated business network owned by Comcast Corp, came under criticism from candidates who felt questions were unfair, serving up opportunities to criticize each other rather than discuss issues. A CNBC spokesman said presidential hopefuls “should be able to answer substantive, challenging questions.” For the next debate, Cavuto said he aims to keep candidates talking about economic issues such as Social Security, taxes and government spending. While some critics say the network leans conservative, Cavuto said there is no political agenda. “We are a business network,” he said. “We really don’t focus on the red or the blue. We are just green. Money in and money out.”  Cavuto and Bartiromo declined to critique their rivals’ performance. But their network ran a commercial saying CNBC “never asked the real questions” and promised it would offer a “real debate about our economy and our future.” The contenders will have more time for responses at the two-hour debate in Milwaukee - 90 seconds to answer questions and 60 seconds to respond if their name comes up, longer than the traditional 60-second answers and 30-second responses.  “You want to let it breathe and make sure no one is rushed but at the same time no one is showboating,” Cavuto said.  Both moderators said they are doing their homework to be prepared for challenges from the contenders.  Bartiromo, global markets editor for Fox Business, said she believes jobs, wages and tax reform are among voters’ top concerns in the November 2016 election. “It’s amazing to me that we haven’t had much focus on the economy and jobs yet and here we are four debates later.” Fox Business Network was founded in 2007, following CNBC’s 1989 debut. Fox Business reached 82 million homes on average this year compared with CNBC’s 92.7 million, according to SNL Kagan data.  Earlier debates attracted record audiences, topped by the 24 million who tuned in to Fox News Channel’s debate in August. Viewership in the millions would far surpass the typical audience for Fox Business, which averaged 102,000 viewers on weekdays in October, according to Nielsen data. The debates will stream for free on foxbusiness.com. Several pay television distributors will let their customers watch the debate on TV even if they do not subscribe to a package that includes Fox Business Network. “The reason we do these (debates) is to help viewers get informed on the candidates’ positions and help the voter best distinguish the differences,” Bartiromo said. “That’s missing a bit right now.” For more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

907,CMCSA,Uber tries new legal tactic to identify hacker behind data breach,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Ride service Uber is attempting a new legal maneuver to learn more about an Internet address that it thinks could help identify the individual who improperly accessed an Uber database last year, according to court filings on Tuesday. A San Francisco judge authorized a subpoena against Comcast Corp earlier this year, in which Uber  sought information about the online history of one Comcast Internet address that Uber believes could yield clues about the hacker. In February, Uber revealed that as many as 50,000 of its drivers’ names and license numbers had been improperly downloaded, and the company filed a lawsuit in San Francisco federal court in an attempt to unmask the perpetrator. The subpoena ruling is currently on hold, pending an appeal by the Comcast subscriber. However, Uber also faces a separate lawsuit filed by one of its drivers. In that lawsuit, Uber on Tuesday asked for a new subpoena against Comcast for much of the same information about the Internet address. Last month Reuters reported that the Comcast Internet address could be traced to the chief technology officer at Lyft, a rival U.S. ride service. A Lyft spokesman said it had found no evidence the executive or any other Lyft employee was involved in the Uber data breach. Representatives for Uber, Lyft and the Comcast subscriber could not immediately be reached for comment on the Tuesday court documents.

908,CMCSA,Banned 'narco' soap overtaken by Venezuela's real-life scandal,"CARACAS, Nov 13 (Reuters) - It reads like a typical Latin American soap opera: two relatives of Venezuela’s president were caught in their Haitian hotel and whisked to the United States to face cocaine charges. As the pair sit in a New York jail awaiting their fate in a case that has made global headlines, a real narco-telenovela drama is also causing controversy back home. Four days before his wife’s nephews were arrested, President Nicolas Maduro’s government banned U.S.-based Latino network Telemundo’s soap “Queen of the South” for “glorifying” the drug trade and harming family values. But with Maduro’s own family now dragged into a drug controversy, critics are having a field day poking fun at what they deem the socialist government’s hypocritical moralizing. First Lady Cilia Flores has been dubbed the ‘Queen of the South’ in a flood of internet memes that joke about the banned show morphing into a ‘reality’ show featuring the Miraflores presidential palace. In one, the 62 year-old lawyer’s face has been superimposed on a promotional photo showing glamorous Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, who plays the ‘Queen of the South’, sitting in a short black dress with her legs crossed. In another, a video has been tinkered with to make it seem like Flores and Maduro are merrily dancing merengue to the lyrics of the soap’s theme song, which go “Queen of the South/ A very famous trafficker/ Born out there in Sinaloa.” In the Spanish-language drama, a Mexican woman from the drug-rife state of Sinaloa rises to become a top cartel boss in Spain. The plot line is infused with passionate love stories, bitter betrays, and undercover agents. “If Cilia Flores’ nephews had watched the ‘Queen of the South’ they would have learned about undercover agents, but no, the telecoms regulator didn’t let them,” quipped Venezuelan political commentator Marysabel Cadenas on Twitter. To be sure, there is no indication Flores herself is involved in trafficking. The government has not commented on the arrests. Venezuelan telecoms regulator Conatel did not answer calls seeking comment on its decision to ban the show, which has been a hit in big TV markets like the United States, Mexico and Spain. Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal, which owns Telemundo, did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on the show’s suspension. In an oil-rich country with an alleged bustling drug trade and one of the world’s highest murder rates, most crime experts argue that profound policy change, rather than censorship of entertainment, is the top priority to turn the tide of violence. Both Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez have taken aim at hugely-popular ‘telenovelas’ - once a successful Venezuela export industry - for romanticizing guns and gangsters. But amid U.S. investigations into alleged drugs and money-laundering crimes linked to Venezuelan officials, the Socialist Party is sometimes finding itself alluded to on screen. National Assembly boss Diosdado Cabello, reported by U.S. media to be under investigation there for links to drug trafficking, accused the “The Lord of the Skies,” another Telemundo soap, of modeling a narco boss after him. “You know what one of their corrupt drug-trafficking generals is called?” the former soldier said in May during his weekly show. “Diosdado Carreno Arias!... Oh sweet Lord!” Cabello refutes allegations he is involved with drugs, saying the Venezuelan opposition and U.S. government are spreading lies, including via entertainment, to subvert and discredit the ruling Socialists. “Do you think any similarity with this scandalous fabrication is pure coincidence?” he said. “I don’t think so!”   (Editing by Mary Milliken)",11132015,http://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-usa-tv/banned-narco-soap-overtaken-by-venezuelas-real-life-scandal-idUSL1N13817420151113
909,CMCSA,Dish tells U.S. FCC: Charter-TWC merger 'not in public interest',"(Reuters) - Dish Network Corp said the proposed merger of Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable was not in the public interest, in a reply filed with the Federal Communications Commission. “The proposed merger is harmful for consumers, competition and innovation, and should be denied,” Dish said in a statement on Thursday.

911,CMCSA,MOVES-Two executives join new investment firm backed by Comcast -sources,"Nov 18 (Reuters) - Former Comcast Corp chief financial officer Michael Angelakis hired two executives for his new investment company, according to people familiar with the matter. The executives, former Sunoco LP Chief Financial Officer Clare McGrory and Davis Polk & Wardwell Partner David Caplan, are the first hires by Angelakis’ firm to come from outside of Comcast, which is the main financial backer of the company. Representatives from Davis Polk and Sunoco confirmed the departures. Comcast declined to comment. The firm will invest in and operate growth-oriented companies in the United States and globally. It plans to do deals in various sectors, and not just in technology, media and telecommunications. McGrory will join the firm, which has not yet been named, as a partner and CFO, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the hires had not yet been announced. McGrory left the master limited partnership Sunoco on Oct. 30. Before she was CFO and treasurer, she has held other positions over the past 13 years at Sunoco in finance and investor relations. Caplan, an attorney who focuses on mergers and acquisitions at Davis Polk, will become a partner and general counsel in the new company after he leaves the law firm at the end of the year. Caplan has worked on several of Comcast’s major deals including its acquisition of NBCUniversal and its sale of spectrum to Verizon Wireless. He recently led the M&A; group and worked with clients such as Aetna Inc, L Brands, PwC and Sterling Equity. Angelakis announced earlier this year that he was stepping down as Comcast’s CFO to become the chief executive of the new company. It has secured $4 billion in capital commitments from Comcast, along with up to $100 million from senior members of the management team, including $40 million from Angelakis personally. Comcast has an exclusive agreement to be the sole outside investor in the firm for 10 years. Besides Angelakis, Comcast’s former corporate development and strategy chief Alexander Evans has also moved to the new firm as a partner. Both Angelakis and Evans previously worked at private equity firm Providence Equity. Comcast announced earlier this month that longtime Morgan Stanley investment banker Robert Eatroff was joining the cable and media company to head global corporate development and strategy.

912,CMCSA,U.S. probing Comcast's role in 'spot' cable ad sales market,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether Comcast Corp, the biggest U.S. cable TV provider, is hindering competition in cable advertising sales, a source told Reuters. The department’s Antitrust Division has sent documents known as civil investigative demands to video distribution companies with questions about whether Comcast was seeking to dominate the “spot” cable ad sales business in areas where Comcast offers service, said the source, who asked not to be identified to protect business relationships. The probe was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

At that time, Viamedia, an independent spot ad seller, estimated the spot cable advertising market was worth $5.4 billion nationally. Viamedia said then that Comcast, in addition to being a cable company, dominated so-called Interconnects in many areas and used them to exclude Viamedia and other independents from some markets. These Interconnects are used by local advertisers, like car dealers, to buy ad time on cable stations. Analyst Spencer Kurn of New Street Research said in an email interview that Comcast’s spot television ad revenue was small compared to its total revenues. “I would guess that if the DOJ (Justice Department) discovers an issue, Comcast would have to change its marketing strategy for their spot TV markets, but overall it’s such a small part of their business model that I don’t think it will impact the company at large in a meaningful way,” he said.

916,CMCSA,U.S. files complaint to stop Staples from buying Office Depot,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said it has filed a complaint aimed at stopping Staples Inc SPLS.O, the nation’s largest office supply store, from buying its top rival, Office Depot Inc (ODP.O). Canada’s Competition Bureau also said on Monday it would challenge the proposed transaction, which has received the green light from competition authorities in China, Australia and New Zealand. Office Depot’s shares fell as much as 17.6 percent to a year low of $5.46, while Staples’ stock dropped 13.6 percent to a year low of $10.68. ""The commission has reason to believe that the proposed merger between Staples and Office Depot is likely to eliminate beneficial competition that large companies rely on to reduce the costs of office supplies,"" FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a statement. (1.usa.gov/1NeaaD9) The FTC said Staples and Office Depot were often the top two bidders for large business customers and the deal would hurt customers who wanted nationwide contracts for office supplies. The companies said in a statement on Monday that they would fight the FTC in court, arguing that they face stiff competition from manufacturers who sell their own products, e-commerce companies, big box stores and others. The deal is also being investigated by EU regulators, who in September raised concerns about possible price hikes. The FTC stopped a merger attempt between the same two companies in 1997 on similar concerns. But in the past 19 years, Amazon (AMZN.O) and other online sellers, which deliver to almost anywhere in the United States, have exploded onto the scene, while megastores such as Costco (COST.O) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) have further crowded the market. Staples was emboldened to make a $6.3 billion offer for Office Depot in February after that chain succeeded in buying No. 3 OfficeMax in November 2013 with no divestitures. This time around, Staples has offered divestitures totaling “more than $500 million in commercial business” in order to allay the FTC’s concerns. This has been a year of aggressive deals killed by equally aggressive U.S. antitrust authorities. Other deals contested by regulators include General Electric Co’s (GE.N) $3.3 billion agreement to sell its appliances business to Sweden’s Electrolux, Comcast’s (CMCSA.O) bid to buy Time Warner Cable TWC.N, and Sysco’s (SYY.N) plan to buy US Foods. Other mergers under review include two insurance deals: Aetna’s (AET.N) deal for Humana (HUM.N) and Anthem’s (ANTM.N) planned merger with Cigna (CI.N). Halliburton’s (HAL.N) offer to buy its rival oilfield services provider Baker Hughes BHI.N is also under review.

Timothy Livingston, 30, Tomasz Chmielarz, 32, and Devin McArthur, 27, were named in an indictment filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey that charged them with conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity among other offenses. Prosecutors said Livingston, a Boca Raton, Florida, resident, was the leader of a series of computer hacking and illegal spamming schemes that targeted multiple companies and generated illegal profits exceeding $2 million. The three men were arrested at their respective residences on Tuesday morning, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey said. Michael Koribanics, Chmielarz’s lawyer, said his client would plead not guilty at a court hearing on Tuesday. A lawyer for Livingston did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and an attorney for McArthur could not be identified. Prosecutors said Livingston, who owned a spam company called “A Whole Lot of Nothing LLC,” hired Chmielarz of Rutherford, New Jersey to author hacking tools and other programs that facilitated the hacking and spamming schemes. Among the companies they targeted was a Pennsylvania-based telecommunications company that employed McArthur, a resident of Ellicott City, Maryland, who installed hacking tools in company networks to gain access to records for 50 million people, prosecutors said. The company was not identified by name in court papers. But McArthur’s LinkedIn page says he worked at Comcast Corp during the period in question. A Comcast spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Livingston and Chmielarz also compromised tens of thousands of peoples’ email accounts, including customers of a New York telecommunications company, which they then used to send spam, the indictment said.

In the case of the unnamed credit monitoring firm, the indictment said Livingston paid Chmielarz to write a program to steal a database containing 10 million records. When law enforcement seized Livingston’s computer in July, they discovered a database with 7 million of that company’s records, the indictment said.

920,CMCSA,"UPDATE 3-FCC wants details on AT&T;, Comcast, T-Mobile data plans","(Adds T-Mobile reaction) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission said on Thursday it asked major Internet providers to answer questions on policies aimed at offering consumers free data by using preferred services and whether they violate the government’s net neutrality rules. The FCC unveiled rules earlier this year requiring broadband providers to treat all data equally, rather than giving or selling access to a so-called Web “fast lane.” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler told reporters that commission staff sent letters on Wednesday to AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp  and T-Mobile Inc “to come in and have a discussion with us about some of the innovative things that they are doing.” The letters, which the FCC made public on Thursday, seek meetings with “relevant technical and business personnel” by Jan. 15. “As you may be aware, concerns have been expressed about these programs, for example, some have argued that sponsored data unfairly advantages incumbent content providers,” the letter to AT&T; said. “We want to ensure that we have all the facts to understand how these services relate to the commission’s goal of maintaining a free and open Internet while incentivizing innovation and investment from all sources.” T-Mobile has introduced a new “Binge On” policy that does not count some digital video services against data limits. Comcast is rolling out its own live streaming TV service in six states called “Stream TV” that would not count usage against data caps if using Comcast services. AT&T; has “sponsored data plan” programs that allow content providers to subsidize users’ wireless data. Users can browse or stream some content from sponsors that does not count against data allowances. AT&T; said the company is “reviewing the letter and will respond as appropriate. We remain committed to innovation without permission [from regulators] and hope the FCC is too.” A Comcast spokeswoman said the company looks forward to participating in the FCC’s fact-gathering process. “Our Stream TV service does not go over the public Internet. It is a cable service that only works in the customer’s home,” the company said. T Mobile said its program does not violate open Internet rules. “This program provides both great customer choice and industry innovation that encourages competition and we believe it is absolutely in line with net neutrality rules,” the company said. Wheeler said the commission wants to welcome innovation in its open Internet order. He said the commission wants to “keep aware” of what is going on. FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai told reporters the letters are likely to lead to an investigation. The FCC should not “haul in companies left and right” to “justify their business plans,” he said. He called it a “fishing expedition.” The FCC plans to invite others including other commercial interests and public-interest groups to discuss the issue. On Dec. 4, a U.S. appeals court heard arguments over the legality of the net neutrality rules, in a case that may ultimately determine how consumers obtain access to content on the Internet.

923,CMCSA,UPDATE 3-Miss Universe host announces wrong winner before Miss Philippines crowned,"(Adds detail, comment, vehicle hits people outside pageant) By Joseph Ax and David Bailey Dec 20 (Reuters) - The host of the Miss Universe pageant mistakenly announced the wrong winner on Sunday, who then had to give up the crown and hand it over to a 26-year-old actress and model from the Philippines. It was the first edition of the annual beauty show since it was thrust into controversy when then co-owner and U.S. presidential candidate, Donald Trump, made disparaging remarks about immigrants. Host Steve Harvey incorrectly announced that Miss Colombia had won the 64th edition of the contest, broadcast live on the Fox television network. The eventual winner, Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach, a Filipino-German actress and model born in Stuttgart and raised in Cagayan de Oro, was initially runner-up. But them Harvey announced to the audience that he had made a gaffe. Ariadna Gutierrez Arévalo, 21, of Sincelejo, Colombia, had already been crowned by Miss Universe of 2014, Paulina Vega of Barranquilla, Colombia, who was forced to remove the crown and give it to Miss Philippines. Olivia Jordan, 27, of Tulsa, Oklahoma, finished third. “I’d like to apologize wholeheartedly to Miss Colombia and Miss Philippines for my huge mistake,” Harvey said on Twitter. “I feel terrible.” Wurtzbach appeared to take the blunder in her stride. “It’s a very non-traditional crowning moment,” she said backstage afterward in a video clip of a conversation with Miss USA posted by the Miss Universe pageant on its Twitter feed. “It is very 2015.” Earlier, when asked why she wanted to be Miss Universe, Wurtzbach said: “I will use my voice to influence the youth and I would raise awareness to certain causes like HIV awareness, that is timely and relevant to my country.” It was the first Miss Universe title for a contestant from the Philippines in more than 40 years. Minutes before the pageant ended, a vehicle drove up onto a sidewalk near the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, where it was held and plowed into pedestrians, killing one person and injuring at least 36, officials said. Las Vegas authorities said they were trying to determine whether the driver, a woman who was detained, drove onto the sidewalk intentionally or due to impairment. Among the notable moments of the pageant, Flora Coquerel of France, who was at the Paris stadium the night of the November attacks by militants, reached the final five and Ariana Miyamoto of Japan, whose father is African-American, reached the last 10. Miyamoto’s height of 1.73 m (5.7 ft) and bronze skin are unusual in Japan and her selection to represent Japan created an online firestorm in her native country. For the first time, viewers had a chance to vote on the winner, rating contestants in the swimwear, evening gown and interview competitions. Until recently, the pageant was co-owned by Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal and Trump, who is leading national polls in the 2016 Republican presidential nomination race. Earlier, Trump’s remarks about Mexicans in announcing his presidential candidacy in June drew sharp criticism, and the Spanish-language network Univision pulled out of a deal to televise the pageant. Trump, who has sued Univision for $500 million, bought out NBC’s stake in the Miss Universe Organization, which produces both Sunday’s pageant and the Miss USA contest. He sold the company in September. The panel of judges included former National Football League great Emmitt Smith, celebrity blog mogul Perez Hilton and 2012 Miss Universe winner Olivia Culpo. Hilton said the two most important things about the pageant were the vastly larger audience and Trump was no longer owner.

924,CMCSA,U.S. FCC delays Charter-Time Warner Cable merger review by two weeks,"Jan 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said it is delaying its informal deadline by 15 days to review the proposed $56 billion merger of cable rivals Charter Communications Inc and Time Warner Cable Inc. This delay in the 180-day countdown will give the regulators sufficient time to review the new information filed by the companies, throughout December, regarding Charter's residential pricing and packaging methodology and its plan to deploy a new low-cost broadband service, the commission said in a letter to companies. (bit.ly/1VDUNtd) The 15-day pause, which is now set to conclude on Jan. 20, will also allow the regulator to look at proposed transaction’s impact on the distribution of Time Warner Cable’s regional sports networks, the commission added in the letter, posted on its website, on Monday. FCC’s so-called 180-day “shot clock”, which was started in September, is used as guidance, though it is often surpassed. Charter said in May that it would buy Time Warner Cable in a cash-and-stock deal that would make it the No. 2 U.S. Internet and cable company after Comcast Corp. The deal has been approved by shareholders of both companies and most U.S. states, but is awaiting clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The National Association of Broadcasters and Dish Network Corp have separately petitioned the FCC to reject the proposed merger, which Dish said would be no better for public interest than Comcast Corp’s proposed deal. AT&T; Inc also wrote a letter to the FCC, in October, asking for a careful review on the impact of cable deals on emerging online video products. However, it said, it does not oppose the proposed Charter-Time Warner merger. Charter said in late October that it expects the merger to close in the first quarter of 2016. Charter Communications and Time Warner could not be reached immediately for comment outside regular business hours.

925,CMCSA,Comcast revenues beat Street; records big boost in video customers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and added the most video customers in any quarter in eight years, even as viewers gravitate toward online offerings. The largest U.S. cable operator and the No. 1 U.S. high-speed Internet provider said on Wednesday it also raised its annual dividend by 10 percent to $1.10 per share and earmarked $5 billion in stock buybacks for 2016 as part of a $10 billion program. Shares of Comcast rose 4.5 percent to $57.04 in mid-day trading. Total revenue at Philadelphia-based Comcast rose 8.5 percent to $19.25 billion in the fourth quarter, surpassing analysts’ expectations of $18.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company rose 2.4 percent to $2 billion, or 79 cents per share, from a year earlier. Excluding items such as gains on sales and acquisition-related items, profit rose 5.2 percent to 81 cents per share, a penny below estimates. The company added 89,000 video subscribers, the most in any quarter in eight years. A year earlier it picked up about 6,000 new subscribers. Cable and satellite-TV operators are battling streaming video services like Netflix Inc and Hulu for subscribers, as viewers are increasingly moving away from pay-TV toward online video offerings.  Comcast has been investing in improving customer service, enhancing features on its set-top boxes and rolled out smaller bundles in a bid to retain and add subscribers.   Wall Street has been keeping an eye on whether Comcast may enter the wireless market.

928,CMCSA,China's Perfect World to fund Universal movies in $250 million deal,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese film company Perfect World Pictures Co Ltd (002624.SZ) will invest $250 million into a slate of Universal Pictures movies, extending the tie-ups between China and Hollywood, as the world’s second largest economy sees its box office soar. The Chinese firm will help fund at least 50 Universal Pictures films over a five-year period through its Perfect Universe Investment Inc investment unit, the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. Universal Pictures, owned by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), is the studio behind blockbusters such as “Jurassic World” and “Fast and Furious”, the latest installment which is one of China’s biggest-ever grossing films. Perfect World said the investment gives them a “direct link” into one of the biggest Hollywood studios, and would help them expand.  The Chinese firm added it would receive a proportion of global ticket sales, television and merchandising revenues for the films it funded. China’s box office takings are catching up fast with the United States; ticket sales are set to touch $8.9 billion in 2019 from about $5 billion last year, according to PwC.  However, global studios often have a tough time navigating censors and getting around a strict quota system for imported films. Hollywood has been pushing hard in China: Warner Brothers announced a joint venture with China Media Capital in September, while Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc DWA.O, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGF.N and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) have all joined with local partners. In November, Chinese film distributor Bona Film Group Ltd BONA.O said it would invest $235 million into a slate of Twentieth Century Fox movies and help bring Hollywood productions to the Chinese market.

929,CMCSA,REFILE-UPDATE 2-Verizon redesigns its Fios Custom TV offering,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc, which launched its pay TV plan “Fios Custom TV” last year to let viewers choose bundles of channels they want to watch, has redesigned the offering. The revamped Custom TV now offers a choice of one of two packages with over 100 channels and three optional genre-specific packs, instead of a slim offering of 36 channels plus numerous genre-specific add-ons.   The move was not in response to objections from content partners but based on customer feedback, a Verizon spokesman said.   The first package, named “Essentials,” has over 190 channels, including the big four U.S. networks - Disney’s ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC with no sports offerings.  The second package, “Sports & more,” has more than 160 channels, including ESPN and regional sports, plus non-sports channels such as the Cartoon Network. In April last year, Verizon repackaged the traditional pay-TV bundle and created a stir with some programmers by moving some traditional pay TV base-tier channels into optional genre-specific add-on packs. The channels it moved included ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp division NBC Universal’s USA. ESPN has sued Verizon, alleging a breach of contract, while Twenty-First Century Fox and NBC Universal have said the Custom TV offering violates their contractual obligations.  ESPN is “encouraged by the changes that Verizon has made to Custom TV,” spokeswoman Katina Arnold said. She declined to comment on ESPN’s lawsuit against Verizon.       FOX and NBC could not be reached immediately for comment. The offering now costs $69.99, along with Fios Internet and digital voice services and three genre-specific add-on packages for $6 each. The first Custom TV iteration started at $65 a month for broadband, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, from a choice of seven for $10 each. The growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate.   Last month, Verizon’s Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo declined to comment on the ESPN lawsuit on an earnings call with investors, but said customers “don’t want to have to pay for bundles that they never use.” “We will refresh (Custom TV) here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements,” he added. Compared to pay-TV giants AT&T; Inc with its DirecTV acquisition last year and Comcast, Fios has a small market in 12 states and Washington, D.C., with 5.8 million video customers as of the end of 2015.

930,CMCSA,YES network taps New York Yankees in campaign against Comcast,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s YES Network is looking to hit a home run with one of its most valuable assets in a fight with cable provider Comcast Corp: the New York Yankees. The sports regional network, which is 80 percent owned by Fox and 20 percent owned by the Yankees, is launching a multimedia campaign featuring Yankees players that asks Comcast subscribers to switch cable providers before baseball season starts next month. The campaign, which will include television, print, radio outdoor and digital spots, is the most public effort by the sports network to rally viewers since Comcast dropped YES in November, when the two sides failed to come to an agreement for a carriage agreement. The blackout affects 900,000 Comcast subscribers in New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.  “The reason we are doing this is because we need to inform Yankees fans, which predominate this area, that they need to switch off Comcast to a new distributor or else there is a very good likelihood that they will not only miss opening day, but they will miss the whole season,” Tracy Dolgin, president and CEO of YES Network, told Reuters Tuesday. One ad, reviewed by Reuters, features Yankees pitcher Dellin Betances, with the headline “COMCAST XFINITY STRIKES OUT,” advising viewers to drop Comcast for another provider. For its part, Comcast argues that more than 90 percent of its customers did not watch even one-quarter of the baseball games on YES last season.  “Given the customer viewership data we have, the price/value proposition for the YES network did not justify the price that FOX was asking for the network.” YES, which is the most watched regional sports network in the country according to media tracker Nielsen Holdings, plans to run the ad campaign until an agreement is met, Dolgin said. There are currently no negotiations ongoing, he said. Yankees’ opening day is April 4th, when they will be playing the Houston Astros at Yankee stadium.

932,CMCSA,Dish sues NBC over breach of contract,"March 15 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp said it is suing Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal for breach of contract and expects to file for arbitration to block NBC from blacking out its channels such as CNBC and Bravo. NBC and Dish are locking horns over the monthly price per subscriber the satellite operator would pay to carry NBC’s channels. Dish said the complaint relates to current distribution renewal negotiations with NBCUniversal. “NBC’s public statements against Dish over the past 24 hours are in violation of the contract between the two companies,” Dish said in a statement. “Today, Dish filed a breach of contract lawsuit against NBC to address those violations.” NBC had launched a website, makedishdeliver.com, explaining how Dish subscribers could loose access to popular programs such as “The Real Housewives of Atlanta,” “The Magicians,” and “Squawk Box.” The website urged Dish customers to push the carrier to keep NBCUniversal’s channels on the service. NBC was not immediately available for comment. This is the latest battle between distributors and media companies that have grown frequent and public. Dish was involved in a similar contract dispute with CBS in 2014.

933,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-U.S. FCC says it receives 104 bids to participate in spectrum auction,"(Adds details on T-Mobile, Puerto Rico Telephone company;  Liberty and Comcast could not be reached for comment) By David Shepardson and Malathi Nayak WASHINGTON/NEW YORK March 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Friday that it had received 104 applications to take part in an auction of valuable low-frequency airwaves relinquished by TV broadcasters,     including many wireless companies who want to use the airwaves to build new networks or improve existing coverage. The government plays the middleman in the auction designed so broadcasters are incentivized to sell at the lowest rates and telecom companies are encouraged to buy at the highest rates. The government keeps a large part of the difference. The FCC said 69 applications are complete and 35 are incomplete. The incomplete applicants have until April 6 to finish their application. The applicants include subsidiaries of Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T;, T-Mobile US Inc  and Liberty Global Plc  and many U.S. rural carriers. Some applications were filed by individuals, partnerships, consortiums or other corporate entities and ownership of the entities will not be publicly known until Monday. Also applying to bid is Puerto Rico Telephone Company Inc, a firm owned by Mexican telecom giant America Movil SAB, which is controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim. In an FCC filing from February seen by Reuters, Liberty’s subsidiary “Liberty Spectrum Inc” told the agency that it may bid on one or more blocks of low-frequency spectrum in the auction to potentially provide mobile wireless services in Puerto Rico. Liberty Global, headquartered in London and backed by cable pioneer John Malone, could not be immediately reached for comment. Malone’s Liberty Broadband Corp. backs U.S.-based pay-TV provider Charter Communications Inc, which appeared on Friday to be absent from the FCC’s list although more details could emerge on Monday once the agency releases the auction applications. Charter’s chief executive has said in recent weeks participation in the auction was unlikely. Comcast Corp and Dish Network Corp both said previously they planned to bid. A person familiar with the bids said that cable company Comcast had bid through a company with a different name. Comcast did not respond to a request for comment. Silicon Valley investment firm Social Capital has said it will take part and filed an application, while the No.4 U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp and Alphabet Inc, which participated but did not buy in a 2008 auction, have said they are sitting out. Analysts forecast that the upcoming auction could fetch proceeds in the $15 billion to $45 billion range, but they expect bidders to be less aggressive than in the FCC’s last auction, the “AWS-3 auction,” which ended last year and set a record of $44.9 billion in bids. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said earlier this month that he was “encouraged by the strong interest that we have seen both from broadcasters interested in selling their spectrum and the broad assortment of parties interested in buying it.” Separately, the FCC said Friday that a decision by a federal appeals court late Thursday to allow Latina Broadcasters to provisionally participate in the auction that begins March 29 will not delay the auction. The FCC in February denied Latina Broadcasters application to participate.

934,CMCSA,Blackstone makes quiet sale ahead of FCC airwaves auction,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A quiet decision by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) to recently sell three TV stations may foreshadow uncertain returns for some selling TV airwaves and lower wireless demand in the U.S. government’s upcoming spectrum auction, industry watchers say. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission’s auction, which kicks off on March 29, will sell low-frequency airwaves held by TV broadcasters to wireless companies and other bidders.   Blackstone-controlled investment vehicle LocusPoint Networks LLC bought at least 16 stations from San Francisco to Miami, spending $66 million since 2012, according to FCC filings and data from research firm SNL Kagan.  Other well-funded buyout firms such as OTA Broadcasting LLC backed by billionaire Michael Dell and NRJ TV LLC, funded by Fortress Investment Group, have also snatched up TV stations in the run-up to the auction. But in late November, shortly before the FCC began accepting applications from TV stations to sell spectrum, Blackstone’s LocusPoint agreed to sell three stations in Baltimore, Detroit and Buffalo, New York, for about $24 million, according to FCC filings reviewed by Reuters. The deal closed late last month. That’s five times the $4.8 million Blackstone paid, but just 5 percent of the government’s $477 million stated opening bid prices for the three stations’ spectrum licenses.  Its acceptance of the deal for $24 million implies Blackstone lowered its expectations for the auction, even as the government’s $477 million opening bid was not realistic,  analysts said. The FCC will first hold a “reverse auction,” gradually reducing its offer to the lowest amount participating TV broadcasters will accept. Wireless companies then bid for airwaves.  “There’s a general agreement among broadcasters that the opening bid prices that you see registered are high and that you won’t be getting that,” said Dr. John MacKerron, professor at Towson University who manages student-run WMJF-CD in Towson, Maryland, one of the three sold to HME. Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner forecasts the 2016 auction proceeds at $20 billion to the low $30 billion range. The FCC’s “AWS-3 auction” that ended last year saw record  bids of $44.9 billion. “If it would be a massive success, (Blackstone) wouldn’t sell right now, right before (the auction),” Enter said.  While spectrum in certain geographic areas around metropolitan areas is attractive, there is a glut in secondary markets, analysts said. Moreover, some of the biggest wireless bidders are still digesting their investments from the previous FCC auction that ended last year, they added.  Blackstone sold to HME Equity Fund II, owned by U.S. President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign manager, Jim Messina, and retired National Basketball Association player Grant Hill, and others, according to filings.  Blackstone declined to comment and a lawyer for HME did not respond to requests for comment.  The three stations sold are among those in Blackstone’s portfolio with lowest opening bid prices. Stations that LocusPoint has retained in major markets such as San Francisco and Orlando say “cha-ching,” Entner said.  If HME is unable to sell the licenses, “they could sell (after the auction) for less than what LocusPoint paid for them,” SNL Kagan analyst Justin Nielson said. OTA and NRJ have not sold stations ahead of the auction, he added. Top U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc(VZ.N)  and AT&T; Inc (T.N) , pay-TV providers Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Dish Corp (DISH.O) have filed to participate, but some analysts do not expect them to bid aggressively.  T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) has said it needs low-frequency spectrum for network enhancements. Sprint Corp (S.N) will sit out.

936,CMCSA,U.S. FCC begins first phase of airwaves auction,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday kicked off an auction of low-frequency spectrum relinquished by television  broadcasters to wireless companies and other bidders that are seeking new airwaves to build and improve wireless networks. The so-called “broadcast incentive” auction is considered one of the FCC’s most complex and ambitious spectrum auctions to date.     The first step is a “reverse auction,” where the government recovers spectrum from broadcasters that will voluntarily give up airwaves either to go off the air for a payout or be shifted to another frequency band for a smaller sum. “A successful auction means that spectrum will be repurposed, a huge amount of money will change hands, and technology and spectrum policy will be shaped for the future,” said National Association of Broadcasters Executive Vice President Rick Kaplan. Of the 1,800 eligible broadcasters, an undisclosed number submitted applications to take part. Eligible broadcasters have until 6 p.m. EDT Tuesday to submit a binding agreement to take part.The reverse auction should be completed by summer and will be followed by a “forward” auction, where the government sells to telecommunications operators and other bidders the spectrum, which it will package into new bands. The results of that auction are expected by October. The government plays the middleman in the auction, which is  designed to give broadcasters an incentive to sell at the lowest price and encourage telecommunications companies to buy at the highest price. The government keeps a large part of the difference. The names of the TV broadcasters that are participating in the reverse auction will not be revealed by the FCC during the auction. Last week, the FCC said it saw 104 applications for the forward auction, 69 of them complete and 35 incomplete. Participants included wireless companies Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), AT&T; Inc (T.N) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and pay-TV providers Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O). Puerto Rico Telephone Company Inc, a unit Mexican telecommunications provider America Movil SAB (AMXL.MX), rural carriers  and financial companies such as Silicon Valley investment firm Social Capital have also filed to take part. Analysts forecast that the upcoming auction could fetch proceeds in the $15 billion to $45 billion range, but they said they expect bidders to be less aggressive than in the FCC’s last auction, the “AWS-3 auction,” which ended last year and attracted a record $44.9 billion in bids. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has said the FCC has seen strong interest in the auction and will boost wireless data. “If broadband Internet service is an engine for economic growth, then mobile broadband has been its booster rocket, creating a platform for innovation, competition and new markets,” he said.

937,CMCSA,NBC sells $1 billion in ads for Rio Olympics,"March 29 (Reuters) - NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp, said it had sold $1 billion in national ad sales for the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, as the network prepares to broadcast a rare Games where some of the most high-profile contests will air live in prime time for U.S. audiences. NBC said in a statement on Tuesday that the Games, which start on Aug. 5, were on pace to have the biggest Olympics advertising sales ever. The $1 billion figure includes national broadcast, cable and digital ad sales, the network said. “We’ve surpassed the $1 billion mark four months ahead of  (the 2012 Summer Games in) London,” Seth Winter, NBC Sports’ executive vice president of advertising Sales, said in a statement. By nature of a short time zone difference between Brazil and the United States, the Rio games will feature more live events such as track and field and swimming than in London, over 17 consecutive nights in August. U.S. advertisers have already bought out some inventory, but some prime-time advertising is still available on the main NBC broadcast network and cable channels, according to NBC. The network has not yet revealed its streaming plans for online viewing but said digital ad sales were healthy. Live streaming of events at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi generated tens of millions of dollars in advertising. NBC signed on two years ago to pay $7.65 billion for the right to air six Olympic Games from 2022 to 2032 before any other U.S. media company could bid. NBC and rival networks have been stocking up on live sports content, which is popular with advertisers because large audiences watch in real-time and cannot skip the TV commercials. Official Olympics sponsors spend significant amounts on ad time from NBC, with some even signing exclusive deals that keep other advertisers out of certain categories for the entire Games. Sponsors have been announcing their rosters of athletes in recent weeks. Citigroup said earlier this month it was sponsoring gymnast Gabby Douglas, beach volleyball’s Kerri Walsh Jennings and rugby’s Carlin Isles. Visa Inc, a global Olympics sponsor, is backing swimmer Missy Franklin and fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, the first Muslim-American to complete in a hijab.   (Reporting by Liana B.

938,CMCSA,"U.S. Justice Dept will sue to stop Halliburton, Baker Hughes merger: source","(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department will file a lawsuit as soon as this week to stop oilfield services provider Halliburton Co from acquiring smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The antitrust lawsuit could potentially scupper the deal that was first announced in November 2014 to combine the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies. Since then, oil prices have fallen by more than 55 percent.  Faced with opposition from the Justice Department, the companies may either cancel the planned tie-up or fight the government in court. The deal is one of several that antitrust enforcers have rejected as illegal during the recent wave of mergers of large, complex companies. Share prices for Baker Hughes closed down 5.1 percent at $39.36 Tuesday while Halliburton ended up 1.2 percent at $34.40. Halliburton and Baker Hughes both declined comment. The two sides had been discussing asset sales aimed at saving the deal, which was originally valued at $35 billion but is now valued at about $25 billion based on the decline in Halliburton shares.  If the deal collapses due to antitrust concerns, Halliburton must pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, according to regulatory filings. The proposed deal also has hit headwinds in Europe, where the European Union’s competition authority was concerned that the proposed merger would reduce competition and innovation in more than 30 product markets. Regulators in Australia also flagged concerns about the massive tie-up.

Baker Hughes developed smartphone apps to help customers in the field decide in real time how best to hydraulically fracture new wells.  Furthermore, uniting Halliburton and Baker Hughes would create a dominant leader in North Dakota with more than half the cementing market and a leading position in fracking.

939,CMCSA,"UPDATE 3-U.S. Justice Dept will sue to stop Halliburton, Baker Hughes merger - source","(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department will file a lawsuit as soon as this week to stop oilfield services provider Halliburton Co from acquiring smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The antitrust lawsuit could potentially scupper the deal that was first announced in November 2014 to combine the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies. Since then, oil prices have fallen by more than 55 percent.  Faced with opposition from the Justice Department, the companies may either cancel the planned tie-up or fight the government in court. The deal is one of several that antitrust enforcers have rejected as illegal during the recent wave of mergers of large, complex companies. Share prices for Baker Hughes closed down 5.1 percent at $39.36 Tuesday while Halliburton ended up 1.2 percent at $34.40. Halliburton and Baker Hughes both declined comment. The two sides had been discussing asset sales aimed at saving the deal, which was originally valued at $35 billion but is now valued at about $25 billion based on the decline in Halliburton shares.  If the deal collapses due to antitrust concerns, Halliburton must pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, according to regulatory filings. The proposed deal also has hit headwinds in Europe, where the European Union’s competition authority was concerned that the proposed merger would reduce competition and innovation in more than 30 product markets. Regulators in Australia also flagged concerns about the massive tie-up. As far back as July 2015, Reuters reported that there were concerns in the U.S. government that the merger would lead to higher prices and less innovation.

940,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-Verizon plans bid for Yahoo and its Yahoo Japan stake -Bloomberg,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is ready to make a bid for Yahoo’s web business, and hopes to make a merger more successful by also making an offer for a stake in Yahoo’s Japan subsidiary, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter. The telecom giant is planning to make a first-round bid for Yahoo’s web business next week, the news organization said.   Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google unit is also mulling a bid for Yahoo’s core business, Bloomberg reported, citing a source. However, Bloomberg said many companies that had been seen as likely investors in Yahoo were not planning a bid, including AT&T; Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Shares of Yahoo fell just over 1 percent to $36.17. Verizon, Yahoo and Google declined to comment for this story. AT&T;, Comcast and Microsoft could not be reached immediately for comments. Verizon showed interest in Yahoo’s core business as early as December, when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would “see if there is a strategic fit” for its holdings, which include mail, news, sports and advertising technology. Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N). The offer to purchase Yahoo’s 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan could put Verizon one step ahead of any rival bidders. The offer will also likely leave Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer out of the mix, since Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said in a recent television appearance that merging Yahoo’s assets with AOL assets under the leadership of AOL CEO Tim Armstrong “would be a good thing for investors.”  The New York Post reported last month that Mayer has been working to team up with private equity firms to create a “package deal” that sells the company and keeps her at the helm.   Verizon shares were down 2.84 percent. ",4072016,http://www.reuters.com/article/yahoo-bids-verizon/update-2-verizon-plans-bid-for-yahoo-and-its-yahoo-japan-stake-bloomberg-idUSL3N17A4N9

942,CMCSA,Obama urges agency to open competition in cable TV boxes,"WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday weighed into the debate over allowing consumers to switch pricey cable television boxes for less expensive devices, urging an agency to set an example for other parts of government to boost competition. Consumers can spend nearly $1,000 over four years for renting cable set top boxes. Opening the business to competition and allowing consumers to chose devices or apps they can own could mean quick savings, an official said. “You could have a set a standards such that anyone could connect any box to their cable and those boxes could compete for lower prices and greater innovation,” Jason Furman, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers told reporters in a teleconference. The Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, in February proposed a rule opening competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. It set a 60 day comment period on the rule that could cost major cable companies. The rule would allow consumers to obtain video services from providers such as Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo, instead of cable, satellite and other television providers such Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications . It is unclear if the rule will be implemented before Obama leaves office next January. Cable and television companies have lashed out against the proposal saying it could stifle innovation. The administration entered the debate through a rare filing into the FCC’s comment period. “When the President personally gets involved is when it’s of real great importance, in his mind, to consumers, to competition, and to the economy more broadly,” Furman said. Obama will also sign an executive order on Friday calling on federal agencies and departments to report in 60 days on specific areas where additional measures can be taken to open competition. Furman would not venture a guess on what kind of pro competition measures that order could spur. The administration is looking to add to actions it has already taken for consumers on cell phones, net neutrality and retirement advice. “This is going to be a whole of government effort to empower consumers, workers and small businesses,” Furman said.

The largest U.S. cable operator said total revenue rose 5.3 percent to $18.8 billion, beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $18.64 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Comcast grew 3.6 percent from the year-ago period to $2.13 billion, or 87 cents a share. Profit of 84 cents per share, excluding gains from sales and acquisition-related items, surpassed analysts’ consensus estimate of 79 cents. Shares of Comcast rose 0.4 percent to close at $61.30. The company is in talks to buy Hollywood studio owner DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc, known for movie franchises such as “Shrek” and “KungFu Panda,” for over $3 billion, The Wall street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Executives did not comment on merger and acquisition plans during an earnings conference call. Comcast is likely interested in DreamWorks’ content library and intellectual property, MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a research note. Revenue at the NBCUniversal division, which Comcast acquired in 2011 and includes NBC, film studios and theme parks, grew 4 percent to $6.9 billion. At its Universal film studio, which did not have major releases in the quarter, revenue fell 4.3 percent to $1.4 billion from a year earlier, when its “Fifty Shades of Grey” turned out to be a blockbuster. Revenue at Universal theme parks soared 58 percent to $1.03 billion, boosted by Harry Potter attractions and the addition of Universal Studios Japan.

Apple’s shares were down 7 percent at $97.09 after its first revenue decline in 13 years, while Twitter  slumped 16 percent to $14.91 after its revenue missed expectations. Investors are awaiting a Fed decision on rates at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). No change in rates is expected but the Fed may signal its intention to tighten policy this year. Economists polled by Reuters expect two increases this year but futures prices show traders do not expect rates to rise until late 2016, according to CME Group’s FedWatch. “I don’t think the Fed is going to raise rates today but they are starting to lean towards the possibility of a hike and are going to buy themselves some insurance by saying that June is more possible than a lot of people ... think,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. The Fed next meets on June 14-15. While the labor market continues to gain strength, inflation remains below the central bank’s 2 percent target and mixed economic data could cloud the path to future rate hikes.

957,CMCSA,"FCC backs Charter purchase of Time Warner Cable, Bright House: sources","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A majority of the five-member U.S. Federal Communications Commission has voted to approve Charter Communications Inc’s (CHTR.O) acquisitions of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and Bright House Networks, two sources briefed on the matter said on Thursday. The deals, which would create the second-largest U.S. broadband provider and third-largest video provider, won the backing of FCC Commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel and Michael O’Rielly this week, the sources said on condition of anonymity. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler had already voted to approve them.  The two other FCC commissioners have yet to vote on the matter. O’Rielly dissented in part, meaning the final conditions of the agency’s approval could change before the full vote is completed and made public. The U.S. Justice Department gave antitrust approval to the acquisitions with conditions on April 25. The FCC declined to comment on Thursday. Charter and Time Warner Cable shareholders have approved the companies’ deal. Privately-held Bright House also is in favor of its acquisition.  The only other outstanding approval needed is from California. A state administrative judge last month recommended that California’s public utilities commission approve the deal. The decision could come as early as May 12. The Justice Department’s approval carried conditions designed to protect competition, coming at a time when the pay television industry faces stagnation due to new competition from over-the-web rivals like Netflix and Hulu. The Justice Department said Charter agreed to refrain from telling its content providers that they cannot also sell shows online as part of the approval process. The FCC’s Wheeler said last month that approving the deals “will directly benefit consumers by bringing and protecting competition to the video marketplace and increasing broadband deployment.” The conditions placed on FCC approval would require Charter to extend high-speed internet access to another two million customers within five years - with one million served by a broadband competitor, Wheeler said. Charter has valued its deal for Time Warner Cable at $56.7 billion, excluding debt, and the acquisition of Bright House at $10.4 billion. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp LMCA.O, had pursued Time Warner Cable as far back as 2013.

958,CMCSA,"FCC confirms approval of Charter, Time Warner Cable merger","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission confirmed on Friday that it had voted to approve Charter Communications Inc’s acquisitions of Time Warner Cable Inc and Bright House Networks. The deals, which would create the second-largest U.S. broadband provider and third-largest video provider, now need approval from regulators in California.  A state administrative judge last month recommended that California’s public utilities commission approve the deal. The decision is expected at a May 12 hearing. Tom Rutledge, president and chief executive of Charter, said in a statement Friday that the transactions have “significant benefits” including greater competition, broader access to affordable broadband, and new U.S. jobs. The FCC-imposed conditions “are largely extensions of the longstanding consumer friendly values and practices of our company,” Rutledge said. A majority of the five-member FCC voted to approve the deals earlier this week.  The FCC said in a statement Friday that an “order detailing the commission’s reasoning and the conditions will be issued in the coming days.”  Charter has valued its deal for Time Warner Cable at $56.7 billion, excluding debt, and the acquisition of Bright House at $10.4 billion. The U.S. Justice Department gave antitrust approval to the acquisitions with conditions on April 25 and earlier Charter and Time Warner Cable shareholders approved the companies’ deal. The Justice Department’s approval carried conditions designed to protect competition, coming at a time when the pay television industry faces stagnation due to new competition from over-the-web rivals like Netflix Inc and Hulu. The Justice Department said Charter agreed to refrain from telling its content providers that they cannot also sell shows online as part of the approval process. The conditions placed on FCC approval would require Charter to extend high-speed internet access to another two million customers within five years, with one million served by a broadband competitor, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, had pursued Time Warner Cable as far back as 2013. The two companies had acrimonious exchanges in 2013 and early 2014 that ended with Time Warner Cable rejecting unsolicited approaches by Charter and instead finding a white knight in Comcast Corp, the No. 1 U.S. cable services provider, which ultimately abandoned the transaction. Separately, the FCC on Tuesday approved European telecoms group Altice NV’s acquisition of U.S. cable company Cablevision Systems Corp in a $17.7 billion deal that includes assumption of debt. The Dutch firm still needs approval from the state of New York and New York City. If the deal is approved, Altice would become the fourth largest U.S. cable provider. Cablevision has 3.1 million subscribers, mostly in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

960,CMCSA,"Comcast to air over 6,000 hours of Olympics 2016 content","BOSTON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal unit will air live over 6,000 hours of competition on TVs and mobile devices from the Rio Olympic Games and offer viewers up-to-the-minute technology to search and personalize content, Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts said on Monday. The cable and media giant will relay 1,500 hours of content on 11 of NBCUniversal’s television networks such as Bravo and NBC, in addition to 4,500 hours online on its NBC Sports Live Extra mobile app and website, which will also be made available on in its X1 video service. Philadelphia-based Comcast will have added improved search and personalization features on its X1 platform for viewers when it broadcasts the Olympic Games from Brazil, which start Aug. 5, Roberts said at the INTX conference, an annual internet and television convention in Boston. This year’s competition will mark the third time NBC is broadcasting the Olympics.  “It will be the most sophisticated and technologically forward-looking presentation we have ever done,” Roberts said.  Viewers can view live TV, online and on-demand content, with the option to search events through categories such as athletes and countries, as well as access real-time updates and statistics, Roberts said.  “We’re going to throw everything out and I think it will help with the ratings,” he added. NBC has sold $1 billion in national ads for the Summer Olympics and the Games were on track to generate the biggest Olympics advertising sales ever, the network said in March. That $1 billion includes national broadcast, cable and digital ad sales, it said.  Live streaming of events at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi in Russia generated tens of millions of dollars in advertising. Due to the short time zone difference between Brazil and the United States, the Rio games will feature more live events such as track and field and swimming than the games in London, over 17 consecutive nights in August. Comcast’s NBCUniversal signed on two years ago to pay $7.65 billion for the right to air six Olympic Games from 2022 to 2032 before any other U.S. media company could bid.  NBC and rival networks have been stocking up on live sports content, which is popular with advertisers because large audiences watch the events in real time without being able to skip the commercials.

962,CMCSA,Charter Communications completes purchase of Time Warner Cable,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) said Wednesday it has completed its acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and Bright House Networks LLC, creating the second-largest U.S. broadband provider and third-largest pay TV provider. The combination of Charter, TWC and Bright House will serve over 25 million customers in 41 states.  The completion of the deals came days after Charter won final regulatory approvals, about a year after the transactions were announced. On May 6, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission confirmed it had approved Charter’s acquisitions. Last week, California state regulators approved the deal. Charter has valued its deal for Time Warner Cable at $56.7 billion, excluding debt, and the acquisition of Bright House at $10.4 billion. Charter said Wednesday the deals “will drive investment into the combined entity’s advanced broadband network, resulting in faster broadband speeds, better video products, more affordable phone service and more competition, for consumers and businesses.” The U.S. Justice Department gave antitrust approval to the acquisitions with conditions on April 25, saying the deal prevents Charter “from using its leverage over programmers to harm competition. The pay television industry faces stagnation due to new competition from over-the-web rivals like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Hulu. The Justice Department said in a court filing last week that internal documents show Charter and Time Warner have typically been less concerned about competition from providers like Netflix “that do not offer live or current season programming” and more concerned by the threat posed by companies like Sling TV and HBO NOW that offer current season content. As part of the approval process, Charter agreed to refrain from telling its content providers that they cannot also sell shows online, and to face restrictions from the FCC for up to seven years. The FCC’s approval conditions require Charter to extend high-speed internet access to another two million customers within five years, with one million served by a broadband competitor. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, had pursued Time Warner Cable as far back as 2013.

965,CMCSA,U.S. court backs landmark Obama internet equal-access rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court upheld the Obama administration’s landmark rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content on Tuesday, dealing a blow to big cable and mobile phone companies. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, backed the Federal Communications Commission’s so-called net neutrality rules put in place last year to make internet service providers treat all internet traffic equally. The rules prohibited broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane” on the web’s information superhighway, to certain internet services over others. In siding with the FCC, the court treated the internet like a public utility and opened the door to further government internet regulations. The ruling was a big victory for President Barack Obama, a strong advocate of net neutrality rules. “Today’s ruling is a victory for the open, fair and free internet as we know it today - one that remains open to innovation and economic growth, without service providers serving as paid gatekeepers,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. But the fight is not over. The internet service providers that sued to block the regulations said they would appeal either to the full appellate court or to the Supreme Court, and telecommunications industry groups said they would redouble efforts to get Congress to limit the FCC’s authority. Netflix Inc and Twitter Inc were among the companies that praised the ruling, while Google, part of Alphabet Inc, and others have backed the rules. Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Democrats in Congress also lauded the ruling. But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group said the FCC is “essentially transforming an entire industry, in this case the internet, from an innovative, lightly regulated enterprise that made huge investments into this country, into a public utility subject to the whims of regulators.” South Dakota Republican John Thune, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said the decision upholds FCC restrictions “designed for the monopoly-telephone era.” He said the Republican-led Congress needs to step in to overturn a decision that results in “a highly political agency micromanaging the internet ecosystem.” Net neutrality is a major issue for broadband providers like Verizon Communications Inc, Comcast Corp and AT&T;, which fear the rules may make it harder to manage internet traffic and make investment to provide additional capacity less likely. Verizon said it backs an open internet but urged Congress to approve “reasonable, bipartisan legislation that would provide a stable framework for continued investment and innovation.” The decision was a victory for content providers like Netflix and Yelp Inc, which have worried that access to customers could be limited without net neutrality. The ruling boosted the FCC in its bid to complete action on major internet privacy rules applying to internet providers before the end of the year. Internet service providers have expressed growing frustration at proposed FCC regulatory mandates, including new privacy rules and a proposal to open up pay-TV set top boxes to new competitors. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said the “ruling is a victory for consumers and innovators who deserve unfettered access to the entire web, and it ensures the internet remains a platform for unparalleled innovation, free expression and economic growth.” The telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom, which led the legal challenge, said the court failed to recognize “the significant legal failings” of the FCC rules that “we believe will replace a consumer-driven internet with a government-run internet, threatening innovation and investment in years to come.” The court also rejected legal arguments from opponents that the rules should not apply to mobile phone web use or that they violated the constitutional free-speech rights of internet service providers. Republican FCC commissioner Michael O’Rielly said, “We all will rue the day the commission was confirmed to have nearly unmitigated power over the internet.” While the ruling was critical for businesses, consumers likely will not notice any difference because the rules have been in effect since June 2015. The court’s ruling was made by two Democratic-appointed judges: David Tatel, named by President Bill Clinton, and Sri Srinivasan, an Obama appointee. They wrote that “over the past two decades, (website) content has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from profound actions like choosing a leader, building a career, and falling in love to more quotidian ones like hailing a cab and watching a movie.”  Judge Stephen Williams, an appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, wrote in dissent that “the ultimate irony of the commission’s unreasoned patchwork is that, refusing to inquire into competitive conditions, it shunts broadband service onto the legal track suited to natural monopolies.” The FCC decided in 2015 to reclassify internet service providers as common carriers under a 1996 law. But unlike how utilities are treated, the FCC decided not to impose rate regulations or require broadband providers to file notice of pricing plans.

968,CMCSA,"UPDATE 1-Dish drops NFL Network, NFL RedZone amid fee dispute","(Reuters) - Satellite TV operator Dish Network Corp blacked out the National Football League-owned sports channels, NFL Network and NFL RedZone, the first time the league has been dropped by a TV services provider, the NFL said. The NFL channels went dark on Dish’s network on Thursday evening, after a disagreement over distribution fees. “Our contract with NFL Network has expired. We remain open to a fair offer that allows us to carry this content at an appropriate value to our customers,” Dish said in a statement. The NFL said it currently reaches 60 million homes and has set up a website that lists television networks that still carry its channels so viewers can watch games through other providers such as Comcast Corp's  XFINITY and AT&T; Inc's DIRECTV. www.iwantnflnetwork.com Dish is also locked in a battle with Tribune Media Co over fees to carry Tribune-owned stations and cable network WGN America.  Cable and satellite TV distributors are increasingly negotiating hard with programmers, resisting demands for price increases to carry content at a time when viewers are being drawn to Netflix Inc, Amazon Prime and other online services. Such contract standoffs have made blackouts commonplace in the television industry. Dish said on Sunday about 5 million subscribers had lost access to 42 Tribune-owned local channels and cable network WGN America in 33 markets across 34 states and the District of Columbia. On Thursday, Dish asked Tribune to agree to an arbitration process to restore its channels. Dish has said it has been giving customers free antennas to help them gain access to Tribune’s programming. In response, Tribune suggested the U.S. Federal Communications Commission monitor contract talks between the two parties. “Regrettably, we can only interpret Tribune’s unwillingness to participate in binding arbitration as an indication that it actually is angling for rates that are above fair market,” Dish’s executive vice president of programming, Warren Schlichting, said in statement on Friday. Tribune has maintained that it is offering Dish the same rate it has under deals with other pay-TV partners.

Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal and the largest U.S. cable distributor, agreed in April to pay $41 in cash per DreamWorks share and Katzenberg agreed to vote his controlling stock for the deal, assuring investor approval.

While Katzenberg will only be paid $1 annually as a consultant, he will also collect 7 percent of the profits from DreamWorks New Media in perpetuity. “Had Katzenberg not received the extraordinarily valuable side deal, Comcast would have been required to increase the merger price to secure Katzenberg’s support,” said the complaint. The lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where DreamWorks Animation is incorporated. A DreamWorks spokesman declined to comment.

973,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-Netflix coming to Comcast's X1 boxes later this year,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) pay television subscribers will be able to stream movies and TV shows from Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) through the cable operator’s X1 set-top box later this year, the companies said on Tuesday. The deal will make it easier for Comcast customers to access Netflix programming on their television sets because they won’t have to switch to a streaming device like an Apple TV or Roku box. Netflix shares rose 1.5 percent to $98.11 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. Comcast shares dropped 0.5 percent to $64.97. The world’s largest subscription video service has been working for years to strike deals with pay TV operators to stream its service through set-top boxes. In 2014, it reached agreements with three smaller U.S. cable operators. Comcast is the largest cable TV provider in the United States. The company reported 22.4 million video subscribers at the end of March. About 35 percent of them have X1, an operating system with upgraded features such as voice control. Comcast has been adding capabilities in a bid to retain customers who have increasingly gravitated to online video offerings. Netflix and Comcast previously sparred when Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings publicly criticized the cable company’s 2014 bid for Time Warner Cable. Regulators blocked that deal.   In a joint statement on Tuesday, the companies said “Comcast and Netflix have reached an agreement to incorporate Netflix into X1, providing seamless access to the great content offered by both companies.”  No further details were disclosed. Technology website Re/code first reported the deal. Also on Tuesday, Netflix announced a multi-year deal to bring all CW network series to the streaming service eight days after each show’s season finale. CW hits include “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and “Jane the Virgin.” The CW is a joint venture between CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) Warner Bros. Entertainment.

977,CMCSA,Comcast to offer prepaid TV and internet service,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the No. 1 U.S. cable company, said on Thursday it will introduce prepaid TV and internet services to attract customers whose credit ratings do not quality them for postpaid services.     The service will roll out later this year in Illinois, Michigan, Georgia, Florida and Indiana, and will extend to the entire country by the end of 2017, Philadelphia-based Comcast said in a statement. Cable and satellite providers are looking for new ways to add customers, in the face of intense competition from streaming video services. The new offering, which does away with credit checks and annual contracts, lets customers refill their service at any time for a period of seven or 30 days for $15 and $45 respectively, the company said. The price of a TV starter kit starts at $80, and an internet starter kit costs $80.  Comcast said it hopes to target customers without bank accounts with its new Xfinity Prepaid Services.  According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, nearly 10 million U.S. households are “unbanked” and another 25 million are “underbanked,” meaning they have poor access to banking services. Comcast also said it has signed a deal with pre-paid wireless service Boost Mobile to sell Xfinity Prepaid at a few Boost Mobile locations later this year and 4,400 Boost Mobile locations within Comcast’s service area by the end of 2017. The company’s new prepaid offer is in line with the wireless industry’s prepaid cellular service offerings that give customers with low credit scores or low income, the chance to skip credit checks and annual service contracts. “We want to create an easy, pay-as-you-go option for people who want more flexibility and predictability when buying our services,” said Marcien Jenckes, executive vice president, consumer services, Comcast Cable, said in a statement.  Comcast, which will announce earnings on July 27, said it will not include pre-paid customers when it reports subscriber numbers in its quarterly reports.

988,CMCSA,NBC has sold $1.2 billion in Olympics advertising,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp, has sold $1.2 billion in advertising for the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the network said on the eve of a rare Games where some of the most high-profile contests will air live in prime time for U.S. audiences. The official U.S. broadcaster of the Games is selling ads at a quicker pace than the London Olympics in 2012, NBC Sports Group’s executive vice president of advertising sales Seth Winter said on Thursday. The problems surrounding the Rio Olympics have helped boost interest in the Games, Winter added. Instead of basking in the glory of hosting the first Olympics in South America, organizers were struggling to get the event ready. Brazil has been grappling with a volatile political situation, concerns over crime levels in Rio, water pollution, late infrastructure and an outbreak of the Zika virus, which has clouded the start to the Games. “It sounds a little bit distorted or perverse, whatever the appropriate word is, but it just raises awareness that there are Olympic Games going on in South America and you’d have to be hibernating under a rock not to understand that,” Winter said, speaking from Rio on a conference call with reporters.  By nature of a short time difference between Brazil and the United States, the U.S. broadcast will feature more live events such as track and field and swimming than in London, over 17 consecutive nights from Aug. 5-21.  The live events give NBC “confidence in committing to our advertisers the types of numbers that we think we can reach,” Winter said. The broadcaster is still planning to air the opening ceremony on Friday on a tape delay, however, which has generated criticism on social media.  NBC signed on two years ago to pay $7.65 billion for the right to air six Olympic Games from 2022 to 2032 before any other U.S. media company could bid. Winter alluded to the Rio games being profitable to the network. Networks have been stocking up on live sports, which are popular with advertisers since audiences cannot skip commercials. More than 75 percent of the ad sales are driven by the main broadcast network, Winter said, although they also include cable and digital ad sales. NBC had previously said it hit the $1 billion ad sales mark for Rio four months ahead of the previous Summer Games.

990,CMCSA,Comcast's Golf Channel beats appeal over Allen Stanford fraud,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday said Comcast Corp’s Golf Channel need not repay $5.9 million it had received from convicted swindler Allen Stanford in exchange for services aimed at furthering his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said the payment was not fraudulent because reasonable creditors would have deemed the network’s sponsorship of the men’s Stanford St Jude Championship in Memphis, Tennessee, to have had sufficient “value.” Ralph Janvey, a court-appointed receiver for Stanford’s companies, had argued that the sponsorship, in which Golf Channel aired hundreds of commercials for Stanford, had no real value because they furthered the Ponzi scheme. But the appeals court disagreed, saying that Golf Channel could have sold the air time to another buyer at market rates. The appeals court had ruled for Janvey in March 2015, but later threw its ruling out so the Texas Supreme Court could explain what “value” meant under a state law governing fraudulent transactions. Monday’s decision restored a November 2013 ruling for Golf Channel by a lower court judge. Janvey is trying to recoup as much money as possible for Stanford’s victims. A lawyer for Janvey had no immediate comment.

993,CMCSA,U.S. FCC chief to unveil revised plan to eliminate cable boxes,"WASHINGTON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The top U.S. communications regulator plans on Thursday to unveil a revised plan to allow about 100 million pay TV subscribers to replace expensive set-top boxes with less-costly apps that provide access to television and video programs, two people briefed on the plan said. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed in January opening the $20 billion cable and satellite TV set-top box market to new competitors and allow consumers to access multiple content providers from a single app or device. The plan, aimed at breaking the cable industry’s long grip on the lucrative pay TV market and lowering prices for consumers, drew fierce opposition from TV and content providers, including AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. The FCC has said Americans spend $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV boxes, or an average of $231 annually. Set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones has dropped 90 percent, the FCC has estimated. The pay TV industry raised concerns over copyright, content licensing and privacy issues and made a counterproposal in June, offering to commit to creating its own apps to allow consumers to watch programs without needing to lease a box. Wheeler’s revised plan is expected to include some components of the pay TV industry’s proposal, and to exempt some smaller cable providers from the new requirements. The plan is also expected to create a licensing body to oversee the pay-TV apps, according to industry filings with the FCC. The revised application-based proposal is expected to come before the five-member commission for a vote on Sept. 29 at the commission’s next meeting, the sources briefed on the matter said. Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for Wheeler, declined to comment. Disney, CBS, Viacom, Time Warner  Inc, Scripps Networks Inc and others met with Wheeler aides last week to discuss “a revised approach... that would ensure that all of programmers’ valuable content would remain inside of, and under the control of, apps developed exclusively by” cable and other pay-TV providers, according to a filing with the FCC this week. These companies fear that rivals like Alphabet Inc  or Apple Inc could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content. Wheeler’s January proposal would create a framework for device manufacturers and software developers to produce a single device or app to gain access to content from providers such as Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Hulu, Alphabet’s YouTube and a pay-TV company. Wheeler has an aggressive agenda in the final months of the Obama administration. He wants the FCC to finalize a proposal to ensure privacy for broadband Internet users by barring providers from collecting user data without consent. He also wants to complete reforms of the $40 billion annual market for business data services known as special access lines.

1002,CMCSA,Comcast will pay $2.3 million to settle U.S. billing probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), the largest U.S. cable company, will pay a $2.3 million fine to resolve a federal investigation into allegations the company wrongfully charged cable TV customers for services and equipment they never authorized. The Federal Communications Commission said on Tuesday it had received numerous complaints from consumers that Comcast added charges to their bills for unordered services, including premium channels, set-top boxes and digital video recorders.  Comcast will implement a five-year compliance plan as part of a consent decree, the FCC said, and must offer a detailed program for responding to consumer complaints “in a standardized and expedient fashion.” By next year, the FCC said, Comcast must send customers a separate order confirmation of new services, allow customers to block additional cable services, improve customer record keeping and require additional employee training for individuals placing excessive unauthorized charges on customer bills.  Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said the company did  not agree with the FCC’s legal theory but added, “We acknowledge that, in the past, our customer service should have been better and our bills clearer.” She also said Comcast had already committed to make most changes sought by the FCC. The FCC investigation found numerous examples of Comcast billing customers for services they did not want but would not refund charges. Customers were often told by Comcast that the company would only address six months of billing issues because of its computer systems, the FCC said. In June, a U.S. Senate panel found overbilling to thousands of consumers by Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Time Warner Cable, which has since been acquired by Charter. The Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said the companies made no effort to trace equipment overcharges unless consumers asked and did not provide notice or refunds.  Comcast told the Senate panel it would make it easier for consumers to cancel service without being forced to stay on the phone and answer questions.

The service, which will be part of Google’s YouTube platform, is expected to launch in the first quarter and will include all of CBS’s content, including live NFL games, one of the sources said. Google’s offering, known as a “skinny bundle” because it will have fewer channels than a typical cable subscription, will cost $30 to $40 a month, the source said. It was unclear which Fox and Viacom networks would be part of the Google service, two of the sources said. The sources requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential. A spokesperson for YouTube declined to comment. A representative at Disney was not immediately available for comment. CBS, Viacom and Fox declined to comment. Google will be launching into an increasingly crowded market. Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) and Sony Corp <6758.T in the past year have launched skinny bundles delivered over the internet to appeal to younger viewers who do not want to pay for cable. Both AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Hulu, the online video service owned by Disney, Fox, Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), have streaming television offerings that are expected to go live in the next few months. Traditional cable operators also have unveiled smaller packages to fight “cord cutting” by consumers who are dropping their more expensive packages with hundreds of channels. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. (on.wsj.com/2eShhLp) Google has been talking to media companies about its web TV for years, but its plans have just ramped up over the past few months, one of the sources said. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) had looked at a similar service but has shelved that plan for the time being, sources previously told Reuters. Shares of CBS, Viacom and Fox rose to session highs on the news before they pared gains. Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox ended up 0.6 percent at $25.12, Viacom rose 0.6 percent to $36.37, and CBS closed up 0.8 percent at $55.53.

1005,CMCSA,TIMEWARNER-M&A;/AT&T-LOANS-Market; welcomes AT&T;'s $40 bln Time Warner loan,"Oct 24 (Reuters) - AT&T; Inc’s plan to buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion in the biggest global acquisition of the year will bring the second-largest U.S. bridge loan financing ever to a market hungry for mergers and acquisitions loans. The new $40 billion bridge loan backing the deal is being welcomed by bankers after a deep slump in investment-grade M&A; lending in the first nine months of the year, bankers said. The loan will be lucrative for banks, led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) and JP Morgan (JPM), that are arranging the jumbo bridge loan. AT&T;’s swoop on Time Warner was announced on Saturday. The 18-month bridge loan is expected to be split between a $30 billion commitment to issue bonds and $10 billion of term loan commitments, a banking source said. Lenders will earn $110 million to $130 million in fees for arranging this financing, according to Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting Services, said via email. “These bridge loans are especially important to banks now, given weakness in the overall investment banking revenue pool,” according to Nassof. If the acquisition is approved by regulators, AT&T; will gain control of media assets including cable TV channels HBO and CNN, as well as film studio Warner Bros. The deal, which combines content with delivery, is an attractive proposition for liquid lenders. “This is a pretty strategic asset, and the financing markets are as strong as they’ve been in a long time,” a loan banker said. “No matter what the outcome of the (US) election is this is a very compelling strategic transaction for both companies.” The $40 billion bridge loan is a large underwriting commitment in volatile markets and the two lead banks are expected to syndicate some of the risk shortly to other relationship banks. “Given the risk and the size and the fact that there is going to be a lot of scrutiny around regulatory issues, JP Morgan and BAML, they’re going to want their risk to come down,” a second loan banker said. Only the $30 billion bridge to bond issues is expected to be syndicated, the first banker said. “The deal demonstrates banks’ continued confidence in the bond markets, even despite the uncertainty around elections and the Fed,” Nassof said. “JPM and BAML should be first in line to lead the bond financing to replace the bridge, which could generate another $200 million in underwriting fees down the line.” In the US, AT&T;’s financing is the second largest bridge loan after a $49 billion bridge loan backing Verizon Communications’ acquisition of British telecom Vodafone Group’s stake in its U.S. wireless business in 2013. These deals overshadow other large U.S. bridge loans, including a $30.9 billion deal backing pharmaceutical company Actavis’ acquisition of specialty pharmaceutical company Allergan in 2014, a $22.5 billion bridge loan backing insurer Anthem’s purchase of rival Cigna in 2015 and a $22.5 billion loan that supported drugmakers Pfizer and Wyeth’s 2009 combination. AT&T;’s deal is the second biggest bridge loan globally after a $56.9 billion deal backing German chemical company Bayer’s $66 billion acquisition of U.S. seed firm Monsanto which has been allocated. The fact that AT&T; has obtained an underwritten bridge loan is a good sign for loan volume, the two bankers said. The bond market has been receptive this year and investment-grade companies have been able to use balance sheet cash or issue bonds to pay for acquisitions and bypass the loan market altogether. Investment-grade M&A; lending slid 26 percent to $100 billion in the first three quarters of the year from $135 billion in the same period last year, Thomson Reuters LPC data show, and is far off the full-year total of $181 billion in 2015.  MORE TO COME AT&T;’s new bridge loan pays a margin ranging between 75 basis points and 150 basis points, based on ratings. In line with other similar financings, the margin on the loan steps up and becomes more expensive over time, which gives AT&T; an incentive to replace the bridge with permanent financing. JP Morgan and BAML declined to comment. AT&T; and Time Warner did not immediately return calls and emails for comment. The corporate tie-up is expected by the markets to face regulatory pushback amid a wave of consolidation in the telecom and media sectors. This deal comes on the heels of cable company Comcast Corp’s $30 billion purchase of NBCUniversal. Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T;’s wireless rival, is in the process of buying internet company Yahoo Inc for about $4.8 billion.

1007,CMCSA,T-Mobile seen as top target following AT&T-Time; Warner deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc is the likeliest acquisition target as media companies seek a wireless partner following AT&T; Inc’s proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner Inc, analysts said. AT&T; announced the deal late on Saturday, stoking urgency in the telecoms and media sectors, where carriers facing a saturated wireless market are looking for content to attract mobile users and producers of shows and movies are seeking digital distribution.    T-Mobile took most of the wireless industry’s subscriber and revenue growth in the third quarter. Its strong balance sheet and fast-growing wireless business makes it an attractive target for a pay-TV or media company, analysts said.  T-Mobile shares jumped 9.5 percent on Monday after it announced third-quarter financial results. At least nine analysts raised their target price on the No. 3 wireless company, which said it added 851,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter.  T-Mobile has taken market share from bigger rivals Verizon and AT&T;, and that momentum is expected to continue, analysts said. “The takeout target over the next twelve months has got to be T-Mobile,” New Street Research analyst Spencer Kurn said. Potential buyers include Comcast Corp, satellite-TV provider Dish Network Corp, and Mexican telecom company America Movil, analysts said. Comcast and Dish declined to comment. America Movil could not be immediately reached for comment. “Content of all kind is rapidly landing on the internet and the internet itself is rapidly transforming toward mobile,” T-mobile Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert told Reuters.  T-Mobile is “very interested” in exploring strategic opportunities, he said.  Sprint Corp, which is aggressively working towards reviving its wireless business, is another takeout candidate, analysts said.  Sprint received more calls than usual from bankers over the weekend after the AT&T-Time; Warner deal was announced, Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said on an earnings call on Tuesday. “Our strategic value to many has significantly grown,” he added. Dish is struggling to grow its subscriber base amid intense competition, but sits on a treasure trove of wireless spectrum that it has amassed in recent years.  Dish has been long considered an acquisition target for AT&T; or Verizon to boost their wireless networks. Dish’s spectrum could be worth nearly $45 billion, analysts said.  Dish CEO Charlie Ergen “has been pretty realistic about the challenges in the pay-TV business,” so it is more likely they would look to sell, BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk said.  The AT&T-Time; Warner deal means Dish has lost a potential buyer in AT&T;, Piecyk added.

1010,CMCSA,Comcast schools AT&T; on media M&A;,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast is schooling AT&T; on media M&A.; The $155 billion cable giant now gets more than a third of its revenue from NBC Universal, a deal it concluded in early 2013. The regulatory and political climate was more accommodating and Chief Executive Brian Roberts’ strategy sound. AT&T;’s $85 billion bid for Time Warner, by contrast, is a dog’s breakfast. The top line at NBC Universal, home to the Peacock Network, MSNBC and a giant movie studio, jumped 28 percent to $9.2 billion. Granted, the unit got a huge lift from broadcasting the Olympics in the United States. But even after stripping out the sporting event, revenue increased nearly 6 percent thanks to strong growth at its theme parks. Comcast’s two-part deal for NBC Universal, which it bought from industrial conglomerate GE, was prudent by today’s standards. Regulators insisted on a variety of conditions before approving the deal, including that Comcast take a passive role in its ownership of video-streaming service Hulu. GE’s then-huge finance division was also under duress thanks to the financial crisis and the parent was eager to rid itself of media assets that made little sense in its portfolio of jet engines and capacitors. By contrast, AT&T; is paying a whopping $20 billion above Time Warner’s undisturbed market value. The cost savings cited by AT&T;, some $1 billion, barely cover a third of the premium. The telecommunications giant also has little experience in producing TV shows and movies. Roberts himself has learned some hard deal lessons. Comcast’s earlier attempt to take over Walt Disney  was a failure. So too was his proposal to buy Time Warner Cable after trustbusters denied the union. AT&T; argues it will have no problem sailing through the review process. Based on Time Warner’s shares, which are now trading $20 below the offer price of $107.50, AT&T; may want to dial down the cockiness.

Pay-TV operators have been competing against streaming video services, such as Netflix Inc, which have been luring customers away from cable and satellite TV with lower-priced offerings. To tackle the threat, Comcast has been expanding its internet business and investing in media assets, including “Kung Fu Panda” and “Shrek” producer DreamWorks Animation. Similar to Comcast’s acquisition of media company NBCUniversal in 2011, AT&T; Inc said on Saturday it would buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion. Telecom companies are eyeing media businesses to tap new revenue through digital content distribution, as their core business declines. Comcast, which is both the largest U.S. cable operator and the No. 1 U.S. high-speed internet provider, said total revenue rose 14.2 percent to $21.32 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average had forecast revenue of $21.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Comcast grew 12.1 percent to $2.24 billion from a year ago. Excluding certain adjustments, profit was 92 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by a penny. Philadelphia-based Comcast added 32,000 video subscribers July through September, compared to a loss of 48,000 users a year earlier. To keep its pay-TV subscribers, Comcast has been enhancing its X1 set-top box to let viewers search shows and movies easily, expanding its on-demand library and improving its customer service.

Revenue from its NBCUniversal division, which includes the NBC television network, film studios and theme parks, grew 28.3 percent to $9.18 billion, helped by the broadcast of the 2016 Rio Olympics. The Universal film studio’s revenue fell 6.1 percent to $353 million due to the lukewarm response to third-quarter releases, including “Jason Bourne” and “The Secret Life of Pets.” A year ago it benefited from its blockbuster hit “Minions.” Revenue at Universal theme parks rose 62.4 percent to $706 million, boosted by Harry Potter attractions and the addition of Universal Studios Japan.

The S&P; 500 healthcare index rose 0.73 percent to help keep the S&P; 500 near the unchanged mark, buoyed by strong results and forecasts from Bristol-Myers, up 5.5 percent and Celgene, up 6.6 percent. The two drugmakers were the top boosts to the S&P; 500. Profits at S&P; 500 companies have largely exceeded analysts’ estimates for the third quarter so far, setting up the first profit growth since the second quarter of 2015. Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data shows third-quarter earnings are now expected grow 2.6 percent, up from the 0.5 percent decline anticipated at the start of October. Sectors linked to interest rates weighed, however, as yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes touched a five-month high of 1.87 percent. The S&P; real estate sector was down 2.4 percent and on track for its worst decline in five weeks, while utilities shed 0.4 percent. “Essentially we’ve seen earnings, there are pockets of strength and weakness, but on the whole earnings have come in better than expected,” David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York. “But on top of that today, some of the yield-sensitive parts of the market are contending with this backup in interest rates, so that is putting a little bit of a depressant on some parts of the market.” Comcast was among the top drags on the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq, falling 1.9 percent after Barclays and Deutsche Bank cut their price targets and cited increased competition from AT&T-owned; DirecTV Now. The stock is down nearly 6 percent over the past three sessions. Comcast, along with O’Reilly Auto, whose quarterly earnings missed expectations, were the primary drags on the consumer discretionary index, which lost 0.7 percent. O’Reilly shares touched a five-month low and were on pace for their worst day in over four years.

In the U.S., stock market losses led by Comcast and consumer discretionary stocks were offset by gains in the healthcare sector, while European stocks slid and the U.S. dollar hit highs against the Swedish crown and Japanese yen. Official data showed that Britain’s economy slowed only slightly in the three months after it voted to exit the European Union. It grew by 0.5 percent between July and September, a touch less than the second quarter’s 0.7 percent, but tempering fears about an immediate economic impact following the Brexit decision. Britain’s 10-year government bond was up 12 basis points to yield 1.27 percent, on track for its biggest daily rise since June 2015. German and U.S. equivalents rose to their highest since early June at 0.19 percent and 1.86 percent, respectively. “The stronger (gross domestic data) print in the UK has given further weight to speculation that the BoE will not provide further stimulus any time soon,” said Rabobank strategist Richard McGuire. In U.S. equity markets, investors took Qualcomm’s deal  to buy NXP Semiconductors for about $47 billion as a sign of confidence, sending up shares of both. Despite beating earnings estimates a day earlier, Comcast  pulled the S&P; and Nasdaq lower, falling as much as 2.7 percent following price target cuts from Barclays and Deutsche Bank. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,216.83, the S&P; 500 lost 0.11 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,139.32 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 12.85 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,237.42. Europe’s STOXX 600 slipped 0.06 percent, with defensive sectors such as healthcare and utilities providing the biggest boost to the index, underscoring investor caution. The MSCI all-country world stock index was down 0.3 percent. The U.S. dollar hit its highest in more than seven and a half years against the Swedish crown after dovish comments from Sweden’s central bank, while the dollar hit a three-month high against the yen on expectations for a December Federal Reserve rate hike. The dollar was last up 1.22 percent against the Swedish crown at 9.0164 crowns after touching 9.0424 crowns, its highest level since early March 2009. Oil prices edged higher on a reported drop in U.S. crude oil inventories, and as commitments from Gulf OPEC members assuaged doubts in the market about cooperation from other producers.

1017,CMCSA,"UPDATE 3-CBS results top Street, Viacom merger exploration at early stage","(Reuters) - CBS Corp (CBS.N), owner of the most-watched U.S. television network, reported results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and said it was still in the early stages of exploring a merger with Viacom Inc (VIAB.O), a deal favored by its controlling shareholders. Media mogul Sumner Redstone, who controls both CBS and Viacom through his privately held National Amusements, in September proposed a merger of the two companies, which he split up a decade ago. Both have created special committees to explore a tie-up. Shari Redstone, Sumner Redstone’s daughter, has been in favor of merging CBS and Viacom under the leadership of CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves, sources have told Reuters.  On a call to discuss CBS earnings, Moonves told investors contemplation of a Viacom deal is still in the early stages, but added, “if it looks right and is structured properly, it could be an attractive opportunity.” Shares of CBS rose 1.8 percent in post-close trading. CBS, home to popular shows such as “Homeland” and “The Big Bang Theory” and the Showtime cable network, said revenue rose 4.3 percent to $3.396 billion in the third quarter. Analysts had expected revenue of $3.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  However, ad revenue, which accounts for more than 40 percent of total revenue, fell slightly to $1.47 billion. That was the result of limited ad spots during the prime time hours of the Republican and Democratic Party conventions and first presidential debate, as well as competition from the Summer Olympics on NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O). While CBS executives on the call said they expect fourth-quarter ad revenue to be stronger, they added that CBS relies less on ad revenue than ever before. The company is working to add NFL games to its All Access online streaming service, for example, Moonves said, noting that the broadcaster is in “active discussions” with the NFL.  CBS plans to begin selling All Access with its Showtime over-the-top service - independent of any cable TV subscription - but is still determining the pricing, Moonves said. Revenue from CBS’s affiliate and subscription fees division rose 13.4 percent to $753 million in the quarter. Revenue from its content licensing and distribution business, one of its fastest growing, rose 6 percent to $1.11 billion. CBS said net income from continuing operations rose to $514 million, or $1.15 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $426 million, or 88 cents per share. Excluding items, CBS earned $1.05 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents per share.

1019,CMCSA,NBCUniversal in deal to sell ads for Apple News,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal will begin selling ads for Apple Inc’s News app next year in an exclusive deal, the companies announced on Monday. Apple will outsource the selling to NBCUniversal, which already has relationships with many major U.S. advertisers. The deal is reminiscent of one that Snapchat struck with Viacom earlier this year, under which Viacom sells advertising on Snapchat’s behalf. Unlike Apple, however, Snapchat has been filling its sales roster as it prepares for next year’s initial public offering. Apple does not have its own sales team after it shut down its iAd app ad network in June, which was used to fill unsold inventory for Apple News.  Apple launched its News app last year and currently has over 70 million active monthly users. Publishers on the app, which include The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, will still be able to sell their own ads and keep all of the revenue, but now NBCUniversal, rather than Apple, will sell the extra inventory.  For NBCUniversal, this provides another platform to offer advertisers. Like most legacy U.S. media companies, NBCUniversal parent company Comcast has invested heavily in digital-native companies like BuzzFeed and Vox, partly in an effort to better service existing advertisers. For example, NBCUniversal and Vox partnered on an ad product, Concert, that packages inventory from NBCUniversal and Vox’s digital properties and offers it to advertisers. NBCUniversal would not say how the revenue would be split for the ads it sells against other publishers’ content; in the past, publishers would get 70 percent of the revenue with the other 30 percent going to Apple. Publishers also have the ability to opt out of having NBCUniversal sell ads against their content. NBCUniversal said it will also work with Apple on new ad products for the app.  NBCUniversal will form a new sales unit dedicated to the News app, which will be lead by senior vice president James Kreckler.

1025,CMCSA,Trump picks regulation opponents to lead FCC transition,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s choice of experts to focus on new policies at the Federal Communications Commission signals a regime that will have a “lighter” touch on regulation and be more likely to favor large mergers in telecoms industries, analysts said. Economist Jeff Eisenach and former Sprint Corp (S.N) lobbyist Mark Jamison were named by Trump’s transition team to oversee hiring and policy for the FCC. They both oppose some recent telecom industry regulations resisted by telecom and cable heavyweights such as Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and AT&T; Inc (T.N) and have voiced support for mega mergers in the past. The FCC is composed of five commissioners, including one designated as chairman, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Only three commissioners can be from the same political party and Trump’s pick for FCC chairman would tip the balance in favor of Republicans. The addition of Eisenach and Jamison to Trump’s “landing team” on Monday come as the Republican president-elect puts together a team to staff various government departments and agencies after he succeeds Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20. The two appointments are harbingers of “a more typical Republican FCC that is lighter on regulation and more focused on competition,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “The focus will be more on reducing regulation than creating new ones.” That would be in stark contrast to the Obama administration’s FCC that enacted or proposed a handful of new industry rules and disapproved some proposed combinations, including Comcast’s bid for Time Warner Cable and AT&T;’s attempt to buy T-Mobile (TMUS.O).The FCC under Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, has had a rocky relationship with large telecom companies, some of which strongly opposed the agency’s 2015 net neutrality or open internet rules. The rules, which require internet service providers to treat all data equally and bar them from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content, were seen as a major victory for internet businesses like Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) that offer services but do not own internet networks. ‘PRO-BUSINESS POLICY’ Eisenach has supported mergers such as AT&T; and T-Mobile as well as Sprint and T-Mobile that were dismissed by regulators during Obama’s administration, according to analysts. He is known in telecom circles for having a “pro-business” mindset, New Street Research analyst Spencer Kurn said.  “Whoever gets picked (as FCC chairman) is likely going to implement a similar pro-business policy,” Kurn said.  Eisenach, who was previously tapped by the Trump campaign as an adviser on technology and telecom policy, is currently a managing director at consulting firm NERA Economic Consulting’s communications, media and internet practice. He previously held advisory roles at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the White House Office of Management and Budget. In 2014, he testified in the U.S. Senate against net neutrality rules, arguing there was no need for new regulation as existing antitrust rules, while “not perfect,” offered safeguards against concerns about the business practices of internet service providers. Jamison is the director of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida. Like Eisenach, he has strongly disagreed in his publications with Wheeler’s rules, including net neutrality and a proposal to open up the market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes. That measure was aimed at breaking the telecom and cable companies’ grip on the $20 billion market and bringing in players such as Google and Apple (AAPL.O) in an effort to lower prices for consumers. Some analysts said the appointments also raised questions over whether Trump would carry out his campaign pledge to kill AT&T;’s $85.4 billion proposal to buy Time Warner (TWX.N). Matt Wood, policy director of the technology rights group Free Press, said that even as Trump opposes the deal, he picked the pro-business economist Eisenach, who was unlikely to want to block such a merger.

Esquire will return as a direct-to-consumer service on Esquire.com, which will house all its existing programming and new shows that were slated for the TV channel including “Borderland USA” and “Edgehill.” Smaller cable channels such as Esquire are finding themselves vulnerable as more consumers cut back on pay-TV services, dropping their packages entirely or opting for a so-called “skinny bundle” of fewer channels. The move by NBCU comes a month after AT&T; Inc decided to drop Esquire from its DirecTV and U-Verse offerings. Major providers such as DirecTV and Dish Network Corp have also launched slimmed-down streaming packages of live TV channels that omit many smaller networks. Esquire is currently only available on Sony Corp’s PlayStation Vue service. “Men today consume content on a variety of platforms and it is essential that we follow our viewers,” Adam Stotsky, president of Esquire and NBCU’s E! Entertainment channel, said in a statement. Esquire Network debuted in 2013 when NBCU re-branded it from what used to be the Style Network. The channel was a partnership between the Comcast Corp unit and Hearst Corp, which owns the magazine on which the network was based.  NBCU was aiming to appeal to the same affluent, male audience as the magazine, trying to position itself as an upscale option to other male-focused TV networks like Viacom’s Spike.

1030,CMCSA,Outgoing FCC chair warns against overturning net neutrality,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Outgoing U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler warned Republicans against dismantling the Obama administration’s landmark “net neutrality” protections that bar internet service providers from slowing consumer access to web content. Wheeler, in an interview this week, repeatedly questioned why Republicans would institute new policies that he said would benefit major internet service providers such as Comcast Corp, AT&T; Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc at the expense of thousands of other companies and consumers. The FCC rules set in early 2015 prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane” on the web’s information superhighway, to certain internet services over others. “These are serious things,” said Wheeler, who steps down Friday as Republican Donald Trump replaces Democrat Barack Obama as president. “People have made business decisions based on the expectation of an open internet and to take that away in order to favor half a dozen companies just seems to be a shocking decision. “There are a half a dozen ISPs (internet service providers) and tens of thousands of companies and millions of consumers who would be affected.” Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, who is expected to be named acting chairman by Trump as early as Friday, said in December he thought net neutrality’s days were numbered. He said the commission should take a “weed whacker” to unneeded rules. Wheeler, a former cable and wireless industry lobbyist,  questioned why Republicans would abandon conservative economic principles “to favor a half dozen companies.” “I can certainly understand why the ISPs for their own corporate interests would want to have no oversight at all and they certainly are advocating that position right now,” he said. Wheeler said companies already are flaunting the rules by offering free or sponsored data services for some products. He said in a letter earlier this month that AT&T; and Verizon’s programs “present significant risks to consumers and competition.” The companies both defended the programs. Under Wheeler, the FCC in October decided to impose stricter privacy rules on ISPs than those imposed on websites like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google or Twitter Inc. The Republican-controlled FCC is also likely to overturn those rules. Internet providers fear net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and make investment in additional capacity less likely. The Republican-controlled Congress is also considering rewriting the net neutrality rules. Some critics and companies suggested Wheeler favored Google and other tech companies during his tenure. [nL1N1DI15Q] Wheeler disputed that and said the FCC did not have jurisdiction over websites. Wheeler suffered some setbacks late in his term. The FCC did not approve his proposal to open the $20 billion market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes. That measure would have dealt a big blow to cable companies and created an opening for firms such as Google and Apple Inc. Wheeler tweeted a farewell Friday morning: “Upon my FCC departure, I would like to sign off with 3 words of wisdom that guided me well: competition, competition, competition.” ",1202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fcc-internet/outgoing-fcc-chair-warns-against-overturning-net-neutrality-idUSL1N1FA0VY

1040,CMCSA,Comcast's NBC in talks to buy 25 percent stake in Euronews: source,"(Reuters) - NBCUniversal, the U.S. media conglomerate owned by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), is in the final stage of talks to buy a 25 percent stake in European broadcaster Euronews, a source close to the Euronews management told Reuters on Wednesday. The investment will allow NBC to reach out to 277 million new households in 13 languages across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. If the deal goes ahead, NBC News - part of NBCUniversal - would look to strengthen Euronews’ offerings, while NBCUniversal could use the transaction as a first step to expanding its operations on the European continent.  The investment will be made through a reserved shares sale and could amount to approximately $30 million, the source said. A second capital increase is planned for all existing Euronews shareholders.  The entire deal has to be approved by Euronews shareholders by the end of this month, with completion expected by the end of March or early April, the source added.  A spokesman for NBC News declined to comment. Separately, NBCUNiversal named Noah Oppenheim, the executive in charge of NBC’s morning show “Today”, as president of NBC News, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday. Euronews was created in the wake of the 1990 Gulf War as a “European CNN” and used to be owned by a consortium of state-owned European channels before Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris took a 53 percent stake in the broadcaster. Sawiris is expected to keep a controlling stake in Euronews, following the two capital increases, the source said.

1041,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-Comcast's NBC in talks to buy 25 pct stake in Euronews -source,"(Reuters) - NBCUniversal, the U.S. media conglomerate owned by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), is in the final stage of talks to buy a 25 percent stake in European broadcaster Euronews, a source close to the Euronews management told Reuters on Wednesday. The investment will allow NBC to reach out to 277 million new households in 13 languages across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. If the deal goes ahead, NBC News - part of NBCUniversal - would look to strengthen Euronews’ offerings, while NBCUniversal could use the transaction as a first step to expanding its operations on the European continent.  The investment will be made through a reserved shares sale and could amount to approximately $30 million, the source said. A second capital increase is planned for all existing Euronews shareholders.  The entire deal has to be approved by Euronews shareholders by the end of this month, with completion expected by the end of March or early April, the source added.  A spokesman for NBC News declined to comment. Separately, NBCUNiversal named Noah Oppenheim, the executive in charge of NBC’s morning show “Today”, as president of NBC News, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday. Euronews was created in the wake of the 1990 Gulf War as a “European CNN” and used to be owned by a consortium of state-owned European channels before Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris took a 53 percent stake in the broadcaster. Sawiris is expected to keep a controlling stake in Euronews, following the two capital increases, the source said.  The memo said Oppenheim will replace Deborah Turness, president of NBC News since 2013. Turness will be named as the first president of NBC News International. Both Oppenheim and Turness will report to NBC News Chairman Andy Lack.

1048,CMCSA,Harry Potter conjures Japanese growth for Comcast,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - With Harry Potter’s help, Comcast can conjure up growth in sleepy Japan. The biggest U.S. cable operator is paying 255 billion yen ($2.3 billion) to buy out Goldman Sachs and other partners in Universal Studios Japan. The Osaka theme park’s success, thanks partly to the boy wizard, highlights a part of the economy where domestic consumption growth is no illusion. USJ was briefly listed, but faltered during the financial crisis. It was taken private in a 2009 management buyout backed by Goldman, private equity firm MBK, and Owl Creek, a hedge fund. That gave USJ an enterprise value of just $1.4 billion. Growth at USJ has raced ahead since, in a manner more befitting the Hogwarts Express than the wider Japanese economy. In dollar terms, sales have roughly doubled since 2008-2009. Visitor numbers are up more than 70 percent - and about nine-tenths of those visitors are Japanese. The latest deal values USJ at $7.5 billion including debt. Such growth bucks the stereotype of penny-pinching local consumers. Despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to rejuvenate the economy, household consumption fell 1.5 percent in real terms last year, excluding spending on houses, cars, and cash gifts. The theme park’s outperformance is partly the result of USJ’s specific strategy. It deliberately targeted young women and families, which has paid off. And the Potter attractions, which opened in 2014, have been a big hit. But cross-country rival Tokyo Disneyland has also fared well. Despite high prices – USJ charges adults 7,600 yen per head – the operators appear insulated against wider economic doldrums. The new deal consummates a process initiated in late 2015, when Comcast bought 51 percent of USJ for $1.5 billion. That multi-year approach to acquisitions is unusual but will be familiar to Comcast investors, since the company used a similar two-stage deal to buy NBCUniversal from General Electric. Limited financial disclosure makes it hard to gauge how full a price Comcast is paying. But it can expect continued growth from new Nintendo and Minions attractions coming online soon. The group could also expand geographically, perhaps bringing Harry Potter to Tokyo. And while foreigners now make up just a tenth of visitors, they should be a significant source of future demand growth. Growth in Japanese tourism has already blown past expectations under Abe. Now he wants 40 million annual visitors by 2020. Comcast should enjoy the ride.",3012017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usj-m-a-breakingviews/harry-potter-conjures-japanese-growth-for-comcast-idUSKBN1683PI
1049,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-U.S. FCC blocks stricter broadband privacy rules from taking effect,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Wednesday blocked some Obama administration rules on the eve of implementation, regulations that would have subjected broadband providers to stricter scrutiny than web sites face to protect customers’ private data. The reversal by the Trump administration’s U.S. Federal Communications Commission was a victory for internet providers such as AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc . The rules aimed to protect personal consumer data. They would have subjected broadband internet service providers to more stringent data security requirements than websites like Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc or Alphabet Inc’s Google unit. The decision will “provide time” for the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission to devise “a comprehensive and consistent framework” to protect online privacy, the agency said in a statement. Internet service providers hailed the decision. Consumer advocates objected. Sena Fitzmaurice, Comcast’s vice president of government communications, called it “a sensible, pro-consumer approach” in which “consumers remain protected by the safeguards in place for the past two years.” AT&T; and Verizon also praised the action. But Laura MacCleery, a vice president at Consumer Reports magazine, called it “a troubling first step towards unraveling critical, pro-consumer online privacy protections.” The rules would have required internet service providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geo-location, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. For less sensitive information such as email addresses or service tiers, consumers would be able to opt out. MacCleery said the Consumer Reports had “heard from more than 50,000 consumers who support these rules through petitions and comments directly to the FCC.” FCC Chair Ajit Pai and acting FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen in a joint statement said they would work to ensure a consistent privacy framework. “After all, Americans care about the overall privacy of their information when they use the internet, and they shouldn’t have to be lawyers or engineers to figure out if their information is protected differently depending on which part of the internet holds it,” they said. “The federal government shouldn’t favor one set of companies over another,” they added. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, objected in a statement that the agency “should be the ‘cop on the beat’” but instead “is leaving broadband customers without assurances that their providers will keep their data secure.” In October, Republican commissioners including Pai said the rules unfairly gave websites the ability to harvest more data than service providers and dominate digital advertising.

1054,CMCSA,Conde Nast to package its digital ad inventory with NBCUniversal and Vox Media,"(Reuters) - Conde Nast is joining with Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal and Vox Media to package their digital inventory for sale to advertisers, the companies announced Thursday.  Digital advertising giants like Alphabet’s Google and Facebook Inc are gobbling up a lion’s share of digital ad dollars, and eMarketer forecasts the two companies will make up 60 percent of the U.S. digital ad market this year.  That has forced media companies that previously competed for ad dollars to work together to offer advertisers larger scale than each would be able to their own. Conde Nast’s properties include major U.S. publishers like GQ, Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. The three companies claim to reach more than 200 million consumers and 99 percent of millennials, according to January data from comScore. This new ad product with Conde Nast adds video advertising, as well as the publisher’s data offering, called Spire, which combines digital behavioral data with online and offline purchase data that is designed to help advertisers better tailor their campaigns for individual people. “Our goal always is to deliver for our marketing partners scalable, high quality advertising experiences aligned with the targeted data they need to reach consumers in a uniquely trusted environment,” said Linda Yaccarino, NBCU’s chairman of advertising sales and client partnerships, in a statement. The move comes at the start of the time of year known as  the annual upfront marketplace, between March-May, when many major U.S. media companies sell the bulk of their ad inventory for the next year.  Though upfronts have traditionally been focused more on television advertising, the rise in digital viewing has forced media companies to come to the ad market with a more holistic approach and sell TV and digital inventory together. Last year, NBCU and Vox came to the market with their own ad product called Concert, which allowed brands to purchase digital display advertising inventory across both companies’ properties. NBCU invested $200 million in Vox in 2015, one of a flurry of investments into digital companies by the Comcast Corp unit, which has put $400 million into BuzzFeed and most recently invested $500 million as part of Snap Inc’s initial public offering last week.

The service, dubbed Xfinity Instant TV, will be priced as low as $15 a month to roughly $40 a month, sources said. It will include major broadcast networks as well as sports channels like ESPN and Spanish language channels such as Telemundo and Univision.  Xfinity Instant TV is expected to be available in the third quarter to more than 50 million homes within Comcast’s footprint, which includes cities such as Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Chicago.

1061,CMCSA,White House backs repeal of broadband privacy rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday that the Trump administration strongly supports a bill to repeal regulations requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. The U.S. House is due to vote later on Tuesday to repeal rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama. Under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. Last week, the Senate voted 50-48 to reverse the rules in a win for AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The White House in its statement said internet providers would need to obtain affirmative “opt-in” consent from consumers to use and share certain information, but noted that websites are not required to get the same consent. “This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor,” the White House said. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the measure, said companies “should not be able to use and sell the sensitive data they collect from you without your permission.” The Internet & Television Association said the rules would “deny consumers consistent privacy protection online and violate competitive neutrality.” Representative Michael Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Tuesday that Comcast could know his personal information because he looked up his mother’s medical condition and his purchase history. “Just last week I bought underwear on the internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color?” Capuano asked. “They are going to sell it to the underwear companies.” Comcast declined to comment. Representative Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, said the rules “unfairly skews the market in favor” of websites that are free to collect data without consent. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said last week consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration internet provider rules. Republican commissioners, including Pai, said in October that the rules would unfairly give websites like Facebook, Twitter Inc or Google the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers and thus dominate digital advertising. The FCC earlier this month delayed the data rules from taking effect.",3282017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-internet/white-house-backs-repeal-of-broadband-privacy-rules-idUSL2N1H5205

NBCU, which is famously guarded about giving access to official Olympic video to other outlets, has invested in both companies. For the Winter Olympics, NBC will be able to sell Snapchat’s geofilters and lenses for advertisers to sponsors, which can cost as much as $700,000 for 24 hours. It will be the first time Snap has allowed a third party to sell those to advertisers.

1065,CMCSA,Vote to repeal U.S. broadband privacy rules sparks interest in VPNs,"(Reuters) - The vote by the U.S. Congress to repeal rules that limit how internet service providers can use customer data has generated renewed interest in an old internet technology: virtual private networks, or VPNs. VPNs cloak a customer’s web-surfing history by making an encrypted connection to a private server, which then searches the Web on the customer’s behalf without revealing the destination addresses. VPNs are often used to connect to a secure business network, or in countries such as China and Turkey to bypass government restrictions on Web surfing. Privacy-conscious techies are now talking of using VPNs as a matter of course to guard against broadband providers collecting data about which internet sites and services they are using. “Time to start using a VPN at home,” Vijaya Gadde‏, general counsel of Twitter Inc, said in a tweet on Tuesday that was retweeted by Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. Gadde was not immediately available for comment. Twitter said she was commenting in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the company. The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives voted 215-205 on Tuesday to repeal rules adopted last year by the Federal Communications Commission under then-President Barack Obama to require broadband providers to obtain consumer consent before using their data for advertising or marketing. The U.S. Senate, also controlled by Republicans, voted 50-48 last week to reverse the rules. The White House said President Donald Trump supported the repeal measure. Supporters of the repeal said the FCC unfairly required internet service providers like AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. Critics said the repeal would weaken consumers’ privacy protections. Protected data includes a customer’s web-browsing history, which in turn can be used to discover other types of information, including health and financial data. Some smaller broadband providers are now seizing on privacy as a competitive advantage. Sonic, a California-based broadband provider, offers a free VPN service to its customers so they can connect to its network when they are not home. That ensures that when Sonic users log on to wi-fi at a coffee shop or hotel, for example, their data is not collected by that establishment’s broadband provider. “We see VPN as being important for our customers when they’re not on our network. They can take it with them on the road,” CEO Dane Jasper said. In many areas of the country, there is no option to choose an independent broadband provider and consumers will have to pay for a VPN service to shield their browsing habits. Private Internet Access, a VPN provider, took a visible stand against the repeal measure when it bought a full-page ad in the New York Times on Sunday.

1067,CMCSA,Congress sends White House repeal of broadband privacy rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House voted on Tuesday 215-205 to repeal regulations requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. The White House said earlier Tuesday that President Donald Trump strongly supports the repeal of the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama. Under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. Last week, the Senate voted 50-48 to reverse the rules in a win for AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The White House in its statement said internet providers would need to obtain affirmative “opt-in” consent from consumers to use and share certain information, but noted that websites are not required to get the same consent. “This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor,” the White House said. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. FCC chairman Ajit Pai in a statement praised the decision of  Congress to overturn “privacy regulations designed to benefit one group of favored companies over another group of disfavored companies.” Last week, Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama internet provider rules, but critics say they will weaker. The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the measure, said companies “should not be able to use and sell the sensitive data they collect from you without your permission.” An Internet & Television Association statement called the repeal “an important step toward restoring consumer privacy protections that apply consistently.” One critic of the repeal, Craig Aaron, president of Free Press advocacy group, said major Silicon Valley companies shied away from the fight over the rules because they profit from consumer data. “There are a lot of companies that are very concerned about drawing attention to themselves and being regulated on privacy issues, and are sitting this out in a way that they haven’t sat out previous privacy issues,” Aaron said.  Representative Michael Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Tuesday that Comcast could know his personal information because he looked up his mother’s medical condition and his purchase history. “Just last week I bought underwear on the internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color?” Capuano asked. “They are going to sell it to the underwear companies.” Comcast declined to comment. Representative Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, said the rules “unfairly skews the market in favor” of websites that are free to collect data without consent. Republican commissioners, including Pai, said in October that the rules would unfairly give websites like Facebook, Twitter Inc or Google the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers and thus further dominate digital advertising. The FCC earlier this month delayed the data rules from taking effect.

1071,CMCSA,Major internet providers say will not sell customer browsing histories,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc said Friday they would not sell customers’ individual internet browsing information, days after the U.S. Congress approved legislation reversing Obama administration era internet privacy rules. The bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under former President Barack Obama requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. The easing of restrictions has sparked growing anger on social media sites. “We do not sell our broadband customers’ individual web browsing history. We did not do it before the FCC’s rules were adopted, and we have no plans to do so,” said Gerard Lewis, Comcast’s chief privacy officer.  He added Comcast is revising its privacy policy to make more clear that “we do not sell our customers’ individual web browsing information to third parties.” Verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so in the future, said spokesman Richard Young. Verizon privacy officer Karen Zacharia said in a blog post Friday the company has two programs that use customer browsing data. One allows marketers to access “de-identified information to determine which customers fit into groups that advertisers are trying to reach” while the other “provides aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses.” Republicans in Congress Tuesday narrowly passed the repeal of the rules with no Democratic support and over the objections of privacy advocates. The vote was a win for internet providers such as AT&T; Inc, Comcast and Verizon. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules. The White House said Wednesday that President Donald Trump plans to sign the repeal of the rules, which had not taken effect. Under the rules, internet providers would have needed to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. Websites do not need the same affirmative consent. Some in Congress suggested providers would begin selling personal data to the highest bidder, while others vowed to raise money to buy browsing histories of Republicans. AT&T; says in its privacy statement it “will not sell your personal information to anyone, for any purpose. Period.” In a blog post Friday, AT&T; said it would not change those policies after Trump signs the repeal. Websites and internet service providers do use and sell aggregated customer data to advertisers. Republicans say the rules unfairly would give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet providers. Trade group USTelecom CEO Jonathan Spalter said in an op-ed Friday for website Axios that individual “browser history is already being aggregated and sold to advertising networks - by virtually every site you visit on the internet.” This week, 46 Senate Democrats urged Trump not to sign the bill, arguing most Americans “believe that their private information should be just that.” ",3312017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fcc-data/major-internet-providers-say-will-not-sell-customer-browsing-histories-idUSKBN1722D6
1072,CMCSA,Fitch Affirms Comcast's IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) assigned to Comcast Corporation (Comcast) and the wholly owned subsidiaries included in its cross-guaranty structure.  Fitch has also affirmed the 'A-' IDR assigned to NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. (NBCUniversal Enterprise) and to NBCUniversal Media, LLC (NBCUniversal).  The Rating Outlook on all of these ratings is Stable.  As of Dec. 31, 2016, Comcast had approximately $61.8 billion of debt and preferred stock outstanding, including $8.3 billion at NBCUniversal and $4 billion outstanding at NBCUniversal Enterprise. KEY RATING DRIVERS Consistent Capital Structure Policy: Comcast's capital structure and financial strategy remains balanced between investing in its businesses, maintaining leverage at its target range of low 2x, and returning capital to shareholders. Significant Financial Flexibility: Fitch believes Comcast's strong operating profile and solid free cash flow (FCF) metrics afford the company a high degree of financial flexibility at the current rating category. Comcast generated approximately $5.6 billion of FCF (calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, intangibles, and dividends) during the latest 12 month (LTM) period ended Dec. 31, 2016. Going forward, Fitch anticipates the company will consistently generate material levels of FCF during our rating horizon in excess of $6 billion. Consistent Capital Allocation Strategy: Comcast's capital allocation policy is expected to remain relatively consistent and focused on returning capital to its shareholders while continuing to invest in the strategic needs of its businesses. Fitch expects that share repurchases will total approximately $5 billion during 2017, in line with management guidance, and that total shareholder returns are expected to be in line with FCF generation before dividends. Leading Market Positions: Fitch's ratings incorporate Comcast's strong competitive position as one of the largest video, high-speed data and voice providers to residential and business customers in the U.S. and the company's compelling subscriber clustering profile with operations in 39 states and the District of Columbia. In Fitch's view, NBCUniversal's size, scale, leading brand positions and diversity of operations and business risk, and position as one of the world's most prominent media and entertainment companies, lowers the business risk attributable to Comcast's credit profile. The company also creates new avenues for revenue and cash flow growth while limiting the impact on Comcast's balance sheet and credit profile. Strength of Cable Networks: NBCUniversal's portfolio of leading cable networks as well as the growing importance of its theme parks business are key considerations supporting our ratings and are a strength of the company's credit profile. Fitch considers cable networks one of the strongest subsectors in the media and entertainment industry, one which provides NBCUniversal with a revenue base largely consisting of stable, recurring and high-margin affiliate fee revenue generated from multichannel video programming distributors as well as being a significant source of NBCUniversal's FCF generation. Evolving Competitive Environment: Fitch believes that over-the-top (OTT) can become a persistent, long-term drag on the pay-television sector. The internet is becoming another platform for distributing video content. Fitch expects that OTT will have a broad impact on the sector affecting the size of pay-television and cable network subscriber bases, advertising and affiliate fee revenues, and programming costs. However, in Fitch's view, OTT and its impact on the pay-television subscriber base will not materially affect Comcast's operating or credit profile over the current ratings horizon. Comcast has sufficient flexibility within the current ratings to withstand modest subscriber losses due to cord cutting, which is not anticipated over the short term. However, the largest offset to the threat of OTT to Comcast's cable business is that regardless of how a subscriber consumes video content - through the internet or with a traditional video service - the subscriber will still need to pay for network access (video or high-speed data service). Fitch recognizes the ongoing secular shifts within the pay-television industry, including changing media consumption patterns, a growing preference for time-shifted viewing, and intensifying competition from emerging distribution platforms that continue to drive audience fragmentation and mute multichannel video subscription growth as subscribers migrate away from the traditional pay-television ecosystem. These factors, along with the potential shift to the skinny-bundles video service offerings from cable MSOs, have the capacity to hamper anticipated affiliate fee revenue growth over the longer term. Fitch anticipates a growing bifurcation among cable networks with ""have and have nots"" cable networks emerging across the media landscape. Companies with cable network portfolios characterized with strong brands, scale, compelling content and limited exposure to weaker cable networks will be better positioned to address secular challenges.  Fitch remains convinced that NBCUniversal is well positioned to address the threats and opportunities present in the evolving media landscape. Comcast will launch a wireless service within its existing service footprint during 2017, which will position the operators to capture brand recognition and existing distribution capabilities. Incremental expenses related to the wireless initiative are not expected to materially impact Comcast's operating profile. In addition, the company made a $1.76 billion deposit to participate in the FCC's recently concluded auction of 600 MHz wireless spectrum.  Fitch would expect such an acquisition to be executed in a manner neutral to the company's credit and operating profile. Fitch expects the initial wireless plans offered by Comcast will focus on existing customers and be aimed at improving subscriber churn and overall customer lifetime value.  While recognizing the growth of video consumption by wireless devices both inside and outside the home, generally Fitch views cable's entry into wireless as more of a defensive strategy to preserve existing market share rather than an attempt to disrupt the wireless market. The asset-light business model will leverage existing extensive Wi-Fi capabilities along with a MVNO agreement with Verizon that reduces capital risk. Comcast's success is predicated on its ability to disrupt the market with innovative, value-creating service offerings similar to T-Mobile. However, new innovative services can typically be replicated relatively quickly by the competition. Consequently, Fitch believes that a lower-cost wireless build-out by cable companies in their respective service territories would be hardpressed to effectively compete from a quality perspective against the four national wireless operators that have invested billions of dollars in wireless infrastructure over a long timeframe. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Reflecting the overall maturity of Comcast's services, Fitch's base case assumes overall primary service unit (PSU) additions continue to slow, reflecting increasing penetration of the company's service offering portfolio. Fitch forecasts that Comcast's video subscriber base will grow during 2017 as the X1 platform continues to scale.  However the base case calls for flat growth during 2018 and 2019.  High-speed data subscriber growth remains in mid-single digits while telephony subscriber growth is in low-single digits. --Comcast's cable business will continue to report low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth during the forecast period as service ARPUs continue to grow in light of the favorable revenue mix shift of subscribers taking more advanced video services and higher speed (higher-priced) high-speed data service tiers, as well as increased overall service penetration. --Cable segment margins decline modestly during the forecast period reflecting ongoing programming cost increases. The increased costs are offset somewhat by Comcast's ability to shift its revenue mix to higher-margin services such as high-speed data services and business services, as well as improving operational efficiencies.  Consolidated margins will be pressured somewhat by launch and other startup costs related to the company's wireless initiative. --Cable-segment capital intensity remains relatively consistent over the near term before moderating somewhat as the deployment of the X1 platform and related cloud DVR and wireless gateway spending winds down.  Capital expenditures related to the launch of Comcast's wireless service is expected to be minimal. --Fitch's base case assumes no change in Comcast's financial policy or capital allocation strategy. In line with company guidance, we expect Comcast will repurchase $5 billion of its common stock during 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action would likely coincide with Comcast committing to and achieving a financial policy consistent with an 'A' rating, including maintaining its leverage below 1.5x on a sustained basis. Comcast would need to demonstrate that its operating profile will not materially decline in the face of competition. Negative rating actions would likely coincide with discretionary actions of Comcast's management including, but not limited to, adopting a more aggressive financial strategy, or event-driven merger and acquisition activity that drive leverage beyond 2.5x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan. LIQUIDITY Comcast's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility are strong based on Fitch's expectation that the company will continue to generate material amounts of FCF. Comcast generated approximately $5.6 billion of FCF during the LTM ended Dec. 31, 2016. Going forward, Fitch anticipates that the company will consistently generate consolidated FCF in excess of $6 billion. We acknowledge that Comcast's share repurchase program represents a significant use of cash. However, Fitch believes the company would reduce the level of share repurchases should the operating environment materially change, in order to maximize financial flexibility. The liquidity position is further supported by cash on hand, which totaled approximately $3.3 billion on a consolidated basis as of Dec. 31, 2016, and $5.5 billion of collective available borrowing capacity, as of Dec. 31, 2016, from Comcast's two revolving credit facilities.  Commitments under Comcast's $7 billion revolver as well as NBCUniversal Enterprise's $1.5 billion revolver will expire on May 26, 2021. The credit facilities provide a liquidity back-stop to the company's two commercial paper (CP) programs.

1074,CMCSA,Comcast goes into U.S. wireless business with unlimited data plans,"NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp said on Thursday it is launching a new wireless service with an unlimited data plan, making it the first major U.S. cable provider to enter into the highly competitive wireless market, as it faces pressure in its core business. Unlimited data, talk and text will be available by mid-year for $65 per line for up to five lines, or $45 per line for customers with Comcast’s top X1 packages, which bundle together TV, internet and phone services. Alternatively, customers can opt to pay $12 per gigabyte each month. In recent months, the four major U.S. wireless carriers - Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp - have offered unlimited data plans ranging from $50 a month for a single line to $90 a month. The move into the wireless business by the U.S. No. 1 cable provider shows how cable companies are looking to add more services to their offerings with the hope of reducing customer churn, or attrition, as younger viewers back away from high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper options, such as “cutting the cord” entirely and watching online. Rival cable provider Charter Communications Inc is also planning to launch a wireless service in 2018. Details released on Thursday offer a glimpse of how Comcast plans to make inroads in an oversaturated market for U.S. wireless service that is increasingly price-driven. “We believe we have very competitive unlimited plans,” said Greg Butz, president of Comcast’s mobile business, adding that the company was able to pass savings it generated by packaging the service with high-speed data and video on to consumers. The company does not plan to offer phone subsidies. The service, dubbed Xfinity Mobile, will launch on Verizon’s airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the two companies. It will employ Comcast’s 16 million Wi-Fi hotspots within its footprint, allowing customers to automatically switch onto Wi-Fi from 4G LTE. Comcast will limit the service’s rollout to customers within its footprint, which includes major markets like Philadelphia and Chicago. It will initially be available only to subscribers who have Xfinity broadband service. Comcast had roughly 25 million high-speed Internet customers in 2016, according to a filing. Comcast did not say how much it has invested in Xfinity Mobile or what kind of return it expects. Analysts at JPMorgan said in a note in January that building a wireless business could cost Comcast hundreds of millions of dollars a year in the first few years, potentially cutting as much as 5 cents to 10 cents off earnings per share in 2017. The wireless service will be available on Apple Inc’s iPhones as well as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Galaxy phones.

The FCC said 175 broadcast stations were selling airwaves to 50 wireless and other telecommunications companies. Companies plan to use the spectrum to build new networks or improve existing coverage to meet growing mobile data demands. The FCC did not immediately disclose the amount of spectrum acquired by individual companies.

1078,CMCSA,"UPDATE 3-T-Mobile, Dish bid combined $14 bln in U.S. airwaves auction -FCC","NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) bid $8 billion and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) $6.2 billion to win the bulk of broadcast airwaves spectrum for sale in a government auction, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Thursday. The two carriers accounted for most of the $19.8 billion in winning bids, the FCC said. Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) agreed to acquire $1.7 billion in spectrum, AT&T; Inc (T.N) bid $910 million and investment firm Columbia Capital offered $1 billion. The FCC said 175 broadcast stations were selling airwaves to 50 wireless and other telecommunications companies. Companies plan to use the spectrum to build new networks or improve existing coverage. The spectrum auction’s end is widely expected to kick off a wave of deal-making in the telecom industry. Until now, companies participating in the auction have been restrained by a quiet period, but that will end after April 27, when down payments are due from auction winners. T-Mobile said its $8 billion winning bid would enable it “to compete in every single corner of he country.” The company, controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), said the investment will quadruple its low-band holdings. Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Sprint Corp (S.N) opted not to bid. “What is most interesting to us was (Verizon) was nowhere to be found,” Jennifer Fritzsche, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a research note, adding that “we continue to believe Verizon’s interests lay in the higher band spectrum assets.” Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in an email that there were three surprises in the results: “Comcast bought less than expected, Dish Network bought more, and Verizon bought nothing at all.” Dish shares fell 2.5 percent to close at $62.38. Comcast, Verizon and AT&T; were down less than 1 percent at market close while T-Mobile rose marginally. Moffett said Dish’s spectrum spending underscored “the growing importance of the company’s valuation as it relates to their spectrum holdings.” Comcast sold spectrum from three of its NBCUniversal owned stations in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago for $481.6 million. The FCC also announced new channel assignments for 957 non-winning stations that must change channels to clear the new wireless airwaves for use. Of the $19.8 billion bid, more than $7 billion will go to reduce the U.S. deficit and $10.05 billion to broadcasters relinquishing spectrum. Up to $1.75 billion will go to  broadcasters that incur costs in changing channels. Sellers had initially sought $86.4 billion for 126 megahertz. Many analysts had expected broadcasters to earn more and sell more spectrum.

1080,CMCSA,FCC could announce spectrum results as early as Thursday: industry,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission may announce the winners of the government’s $19.8 billion spectrum auction as early as Thursday, industry officials told Reuters. The broadcast incentive spectrum auction is one of the commission’s most complex and ambitious to date attracting wireless and other telecommunications companies who are buying television airwaves from broadcasters for wireless use. Companies plan to use the spectrum to build new networks or improve existing coverage. An FCC spokesman declined to comment on when the results will be announced. The FCC said last year that 62 bidders made upfront payments to take part, including AT&T; Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) - which is controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and U.S. Cellular Corp (USM.N). Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said “it will be interesting to see if T-Mobile will get a nationwide license and how much more on top of that; if Verizon was actually bidding; how much and where Comcast and the other cable guys were bidding/winning (nationwide or just their markets),” in an email on Thursday. BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said in a 2016 research note he believed Comcast had made an auction deposit of $1.8 billion and AT&T; and T-Mobile each made deposits of more than $2 billion, citing company financial statements. The companies have declined to confirm how much they made in deposits, citing FCC rules. U.S. Cellular said in a securities filing in February it had “submitted bids for a minimum amount of $327 million” in the auction. From the auction closing, a quiet period extends for 10 business days preventing some companies from talking to participants about potential tie-ups or mergers. Of the $19.8 billion being raised to acquire 84 megahertz of spectrum, more than $6 billion will go to reduce the U.S. deficit, more than $10 billion will go to broadcasters that chose to relinquish spectrum rights, and up to $1.75 billion for other broadcasters that incur costs in changing channels. In June, the FCC said sellers had initially sought $86.4 billion for 126 megahertz. Many analysts had expected broadcasters to earn substantially more. In February, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s Fox Television unit (FOXA.O) said it would receive about $350 million in proceeds from spectrum sales. Tribune Media Co (TRCO.N) said it expected $190 million in proceeds from the auction. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in February “these low-band airwaves will improve wireless coverage across the country.” The spectrum will transition over 39 months. Some stations will transition to a new band and a new channel, while others will move off-air. Those going off the air must give at least 30 days notice.

1082,CMCSA,"UPDATE 4-Verizon profit, revenue miss Wall Street view as subscribers dash","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) on Thursday reported its first-ever quarterly loss of subscribers, even as it offered an unlimited data plan, raising questions on whether the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier may need a larger acquisition than Yahoo to diversify its business.  Verizon has been struggling to fend off smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N) in a maturing market for U.S. wireless service, and in February offered an unlimited data plan for the first time in more than five years.  While it has pursued other revenue streams, including a $4.48 billion deal for Yahoo Inc's YHOO.O core business, analysts have questioned if it should pursue a more transformative combination.  “We continue to believe that the company needs a strategic transaction to support their wireless business for the long-term,” analysts at New Street Research said in a note.  Meanwhile, Verizon’s main competitor AT&T Inc (T.N) plans to diversify its business through an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), which would give it control of cable TV channels like HBO and other coveted media assets.  Verizon’s shares were down 1.2 percent at $48.33 in midday trade.  Earlier this week, Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said in an interview with Bloomberg News that he is open to deal talks with companies ranging from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).  On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis clarified the comments, saying that while the company would consider deals that are in the interest of shareholders, it is confident in its assets.  “The ecosystem is constantly changing, and if there’s somebody who comes to us with an idea of how we can kind of leapfrog forward in that environment, we’re going to listen to them,” Ellis said in an interview with Reuters. But he added, “We are very confident with the strategy that we have.”  In the first quarter, Verizon said it lost 307,000 retail postpaid subscribers or those who pay a monthly bill. Analysts on average were expecting net additions of 222,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.  Churn, or customer defections, among wireless retail customers who pay bills on a monthly basis, increased to 1.15 percent of total wireless subscribers, compared with the average analyst estimate of 1.03 percent, according to FactSet.  Ellis noted that churn rose in the first half of the quarter but came down in response to the relaunch of unlimited plans. “It really was a tale of two halves,” he said.  But analysts viewed the results as disappointing.  “They badly missed on every important subscriber metric, and it just underscores that the wireless business is a severely growth-challenged business at the moment,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson in an interview.Net income attributable to Verizon fell to $3.45 billion, or 84 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $4.31 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings per share was 95 cents.  Total operating revenue fell to $29.81 billion from $32.17 billion a year earlier.  According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts had expected adjusted earnings per share of 99 cents and revenue of $30.77 billion.

Shares rose as much as 4 percent to a record high in early trading and were last at $39.91, up 3 percent from Wednesday’s close. Comcast’s cable television business is under pressure as younger viewers shun cable bundles in favor of cheaper streaming options such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O).

Last year, Comcast made Netflix available through X1 and announced a similar deal with Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube in February. Revenue in Comcast’s cable business rose 5.8 percent as the company added 42,000 video subscribers and 429,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, which industry analysts considered to be strong growth. The company also plans to offer a wireless service later this year in hope of increasing customer loyalty. The service, called Xfinity Mobile, will launch on Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ.N) airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the companies.  “We believe wireless represents the next massive opportunity for cable and this has yet to be embraced by investors,” wrote Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research.   Industry analysts have speculated that Comcast’s entry into the wireless market could mean it wants to buy a U.S. wireless carrier such as T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) or Verizon.

Net income attributable to Comcast rose 20.2 percent to $2.57 billion, or 53 cents a share, during the company’s first quarter ended March 31, the company said on Thursday. Revenue rose 8.9 percent to $20.46 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of 44 cents per share and revenue of $20.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Comcast is facing pressure in its cable television business as younger viewers shun bigger cable bundles in favor of cheaper streaming options such as Netflix Inc. The company has been investing in improving its customer service and has tried to make its X1 platform a destination for a variety of content. Last year, Comcast made Netflix available through its X1 set top box and announced a similar deal with Alphabet Inc’s YouTube in February. The company also plans to offer a wireless service later this year in the hopes of increasing customer loyalty. The service, called Xfinity Mobile, will launch on Verizon Communications Inc’s airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the companies. Revenue in Comcast’s cable business rose 5.8 percent as the company added 42,000 video subscribers and 429,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter. NBCUniversal sales rose 14.7 percent, helped by a 43.2 percent increase in filmed entertainment revenue.

The service, called XFi, allows users to set up their home Wi-Fi, shut off children’s devices at bedtime, and troubleshoot problems from an application on their mobile phones, website or television. It is now available for free to 10 million of Comcast’s Xfinity Internet customers with compatible WiFi devices.

Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday. A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other’s consent. Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011. Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added.

1113,CMCSA,"UPDATE 1-Charter, Comcast explore wireless partnership with Sprint-sources","(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp is in talks with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp about a partnership to boost the two U.S. cable companies’ wireless offerings, according to sources familiar with the matter. Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday. A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other’s consent. Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011. Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the negotiations, also said that Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. Such a deal would allow Sprint to invest more in its network, the newspaper added.

Called AMC Premiere, the on-demand offering also includes movies and exclusive content such as deleted scenes or interviews with series stars and producers. At first, it will be available only to subscribers of Comcast Corp’s Xfinity TV packages. The move is a new example of how TV networks and distributors are trying to adapt to rapidly shifting viewer habits, particularly among young people who are flocking to on-demand and ad-free programing. Unlike standalone streaming options from Time Warner Inc’s HBO and from CBS Corp, AMC’s offering will be available exclusively to pay TV customers.  “It made so much sense to start where the viewers are,” Charlie Collier, president of AMC, SundanceTV and AMC Studios, said in an interview.  Reuters first reported AMC’s plans for a commercial-free option in March.  Subscribers to AMC Premiere, which costs $4.99 per month, will be able to watch ad-free episodes of current network series starting as they debut on the cable channel. The programing will be watchable initially through an Xfinity set-top box or the Xfinity Stream website or app, and later on AMC’s apps and its website.  AMC plans to expand the subscription option beyond Comcast to other pay TV providers, Collier said.  For Comcast, the largest U.S. pay TV operator, AMC Premiere adds to the growing stable of on-demand options the company offers to help retain customers. “I don’t think it’s an option necessarily for everyone, but there is certainly a segment of passionate viewers and fans that I think they could find this very appealing,” said Matt Strauss, Comcast’s executive vice president and general manager of video and entertainment services.

Amazon could help bankroll a network Dish is building focused on the ""Internet of Things"", and could possibly offer its Prime members an option to pay a little more per month for a connectivity or phone plan, the Journal reported on Thursday, citing one person.

An acquisition of Dish by Amazon is highly unlikely, the WSJ report added. Amazon and Dish were not immediately available for comment. Analysts have said that the telecoms and cable sectors are primed for a wave of deal activity, and executives have openly talked about potential mergers.

1119,CMCSA,Sprint launches new leasing options for cost-conscious consumers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp said on Friday that it was launching new leasing options aimed at price-sensitive customers who want to upgrade their phones more often, the carrier’s latest effort to lure subscribers in an oversaturated market for wireless service.   The No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier will now allow customers to lease any phone and have the option to upgrade it after a year. Previously, the option was only available for Apple Inc iPhones and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s Galaxy devices. At 18 months, customers can either return their old phones and upgrade to new ones or purchase their devices. Those who want to buy their phones can pay the remaining amount in a lump sum or in six monthly increments. “We want to give full flexibility to our customers because you don’t want to get stuck with an old phone,” Robert Hackl, Sprint’s senior vice president of leasing, said in an interview. The changes come at a time when the U.S. wireless market is becoming increasingly competitive, and carriers are battling each other to lure customers through new deals. Verizon Communications Inc in February reintroduced unlimited data plans for the first time in more than five years.  Earlier this year, Sprint began offering five lines of unlimited data for $90, cheaper than competitors’ plans. In June, it launched a promotion for free unlimited data, talk and text for a year for customers who bring their own devices.  Sprint is the only carrier that leases devices to customers, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.  “It’s about lowering the cost for the consumer,” he said. “What’s in it for the carrier is people with new devices are happier. They are getting access to the new capabilities of the network.” The company, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp , is believed to be exploring a tie-up with rival T-Mobile US Inc. Sprint has also entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp on a wireless deal that would allow the cable companies to use its network.  “Considering that they’re more in an M&A; mindset, they need a growing company,” Entner said, of Sprint executives. “Nothing draws more customers into the door than low prices.” ",7142017,http://www.reuters.com/article/sprint-corp-leasing/sprint-launches-new-leasing-options-for-cost-conscious-consumers-idUSL1N1K41LV
1120,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-ABC News to target millennials with social video partnership,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) ABC News launched a partnership on Tuesday with ATTN:, a video news site focused on younger audiences, to co-produce videos for social media including Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) Instagram and for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).  The two will use ABC’s footage and equipment to produce short-length stories appealing to both companies’ audiences. ATTN: co-founder and Editor-in-Chief Matthew Segal will join ABC News as a contributor, the companies said on Tuesday. News networks are feeling pressure to find ways to reach younger audiences as millennials increasingly move to sites like YouTube and Hulu instead of broadcast TV. Only 8 percent of U.S. viewers of national broadcast television news in 2016 were in the 18-34-year-old age bracket, according to Nielsen.  Colby Smith, vice president of digital media at ABC Television Group, said the average age of viewers across ABC News’ digital platforms ranged from 30 to 40 years old, while Segal said the median age of ATTN:’s viewers was mid-to-late 20s. “One area where we’ve never homed in are big exclusives and interviews in our videos, and that’s where Matthew and his team are going to focus,” Smith said in an interview.  While ABC News regularly books big-name interviews for its programs including “Good Morning America” and “World News Tonight with David Muir,” ATTN: will bring its digital-first expertise to cut the footage for social media, ABC News said.  ABC News and ATTN: will have the right to monetize the videos that air on their social media platforms under the deal, Segal said. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The partnership comes after Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBC News launched a twice-per-day news show on Snapchat earlier this month to attract younger viewers. NBC News also introduced a digital video service called “NBC Left Field” to produce short documentaries and videos for YouTube, Facebook and Instagram with the intention of eventually running ads.

1122,CMCSA,"UPDATE 1-Comcast 2nd-qtr results top estimates on film, theme parks growth","(Adds details from the earnings call, updates share price) By Anjali Athavaley and Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp on Thursday reported quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates on higher revenue in its filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses, even as the No. 1 U.S. cable operator lost more video subscribers. Comcast’s shares rose 2 percent to $40.16 in early trading. Comcast and other pay television operators are facing pressure as younger viewers drop bigger cable bundles for cheaper streaming options such as Netflix Inc and the growing number of online “skinny bundles” of channels. Comcast and cable operator Charter Communications Inc are in talks with Sprint Corp about a partnership to boost the two U.S. cable companies’ wireless offerings, sources had told Reuters in June. Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts dismissed speculation on Thursday that Comcast needed to buy or merge with another company. “I think I’ve said, and I think we’ve said in multiple forms, that we really feel we are not missing anything,” Roberts said on the company’s analyst call Thursday morning. Comcast has taken a number of steps to allow users of its X1 set top box to get access to a variety of content. Last year, Comcast made Netflix available through X1 and announced a similar deal with Alphabet Inc’s YouTube in February. Still, Comcast lost 34,000 video subscribers in the quarter, compared with the 4,000 customers lost in the year-earlier period. Comcast also added 175,000 broadband subscribers, compared with additions of 220,000 a year ago. The proliferation of “skinny bundles,” however, helps its NBCUniversal media unit’s bottom line because the company has very favorable terms for its content on those services, Roberts said, adding he was skeptical about the skinny-bundle business becoming profitable. Comcast introduced a wireless service in May in hopes of bundling more services together and increasing customer loyalty. The service, called Xfinity Mobile, launched on Verizon Communications Inc’s airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the companies. Early results indicate the mobile service is off to a strong start, though the company did not disclose subscriber numbers. Net income attributable to Comcast rose 23.9 percent to $2.51 billion, or 52 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $2.03 billion, or 41 cents a share. Revenue was up 9.8 percent to $21.16 billion. Analysts expected earnings of 48 cents per share on revenue of $20.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1131,CMCSA,Comcast builds out 'smart home' strategy as cable shrinks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp may be best known as a cable company, but it is banking on remote-controlled door locks and cameras as well as other “smart-home” offerings to accelerate its growing home security business.   The push to diversify comes at a time when more U.S. consumers who are dropping traditional cable television packages, or cutting the cord, in favor of cheaper alternatives. Comcast and its rivals want to offer more services in the home to increase their revenues and create more loyal customers. Comcast is already seeing traction at its Xfinity Home security service, which launched in 2012. Subscribers have doubled to more than 1 million in the last two years, according to quarterly results released in July.  But selling security services to consumers, which Comcast says is more than a $9 billion market, is just part of the strategy.   The company is now turning to home automation - think standalone features such as cameras and thermostats that can be controlled remotely - for consumers who reside in apartments and condominiums.  The U.S. smart-home market, which encompasses devices ranging from door locks to sprinkler systems that can be programmed to various schedules, is expected to grow to $47 billion annually by 2020, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.  Daniel Herscovici, senior vice president and general manager of Xfinity Home, told Reuters that the home security industry offered certain advantages such as low churn, or attrition, since consumers rarely switch providers unless they move.     The cost of signing up customers is low since Comcast is able to sell to people who also subscribe to broadband and cable services.  The company first focused on home security because it was too early in 2012 to talk about connected devices, he said. Now it is also turning to automation. “We haven’t reached anywhere near our full potential,” he said in an interview. Overall, the home security and automation market is a natural extension for broadband providers who are looking for additional ways to leverage its existing infrastructure and workforce to sell more services to new and existing customers. Comcast has said that 55 percent of Xfinity Home customers become new Comcast subscribers. But Comcast and others still face a shrinking market in traditional pay-TV services. Six of the largest U.S. pay TV firms lost a total of 723,000 customers in the second quarter in what JPMorgan analysts called the industry’s worst ever quarterly results during the period.  The big question for Comcast is whether a monthly subscription model - one that provides a recurring revenue stream beyond the initial sale of equipment - can take off in a market where consumers have the option of paying once for items like cameras without the extra perks that come with an additional fee, analysts said. Comcast aims to find out with a pilot program in three markets to offer a video camera bundled with its Xfinity Internet for an additional $10 a month, a company spokesman said. Customers can purchase up to six cameras for $99 each and then pay the monthly fee, which includes installation, cloud storage for video recordings and the ability to create and share video clips.  The offer is meant for condo owners and apartment dwellers who don’t need full home security systems, but still want to keep an eye on where they live. If successful, the pilot will likely expand this year, a Comcast spokesman said. Vivint, a home automation company owned by Blackstone Group, says it has succeeded selling monthly service plans for $39.99 and $49.99. The product includes features such as an app that allows consumers to control all smart-home functions from their phone, and professional monitoring that dispatches emergency services when needed and customer support.  Part of the appeal to the consumer is that they can select devices to be integrated into a single system via a curated platform, Vivint executives said. According to Strategy Analytics, Comcast has roughly 10 percent of the market for interactive security, the category of home security that offers remote monitoring and arming of systems, compared to market leader ADT Corp’s 20 percent. Comcast plans to get a bigger slice of that market share. In March, it bought out its supplier of home security equipment, IControl Networks Inc, for an undisclosed amount. The deal gives Comcast more control over research and development capabilities and provides it with a new revenue stream as a wholesaler to other companies in the market. Blake Kozak, principal analyst at market research firm IHS, said Comcast has an advantage because it is already in the home, with services like a remote control that responds to voice commands and the X1 set top box.  “They have a lot of things going for them in terms of creating an ecosystem for the consumer and getting them to engage,” he said.

1135,CMCSA,"UPDATE 3-Disney,  Comcast shares fall on disappointing forecasts","(Reuters) - Shares of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) tumbled on Thursday after Disney warned of stagnant earnings and No. 1 cable operator Comcast forecast more subscriber losses. Shares of Disney closed 4.4 percent lower at $97.06 on the New York Stock Exchange, and Comcast fell 6.2 percent to $38.60 on Nasdaq. Walt Disney and Comcast are the two latest examples of media and entertainment companies struggling under increased competition and a trend by consumers of ditching cable packages for less expensive online streaming options. Comcast expects to lose up to 150,000 video subscribers in the third quarter due to competition and the impact of recent hurricanes, Matthew Strauss, executive vice president of the company’s Xfinity Services, said at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference. The Xfinity unit comprises Comcast’s residential video, phone and internet businesses. Walt Disney’s chief executive, Bob Iger, said at the conference that the company’s earnings per share for the current fiscal year ending Oct. 1 will be roughly in line with a year ago, when it earned $5.72 per share. Analysts had been expecting the company to earn $5.88 this year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Disney’s new streaming service, set to launch in late 2019, will exclusively feature movies from the “Star Wars” franchise and Marvel films such as “Avengers” and “Iron Man,” Iger said. In addition, Disney will create four to five new Disney movies and four or five original TV shows exclusively for the streaming app, he said. Disney said last month it would launch its own streaming service and stop providing new movies to Netflix starting in 2019. The company had not previously disclosed the distribution plan for the films from superhero studio Marvel and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm after the deal with Netflix ends in 2018.

1136,CMCSA,"US STOCKS-Wall St slips as media stocks, Hurricane Irma weigh","* Disney, Comcast declines weigh on indexes * General Electric shares drop after analyst report * Healthcare shares gain, led by Bristol, AbbVie * Dow down 0.2 pct, S&P; down 0.05 pct, Nasdaq up 0.05 pct (Updates to late afternoon) By Lewis Krauskopf Sept 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street edged lower on Thursday as media stocks weighed after negative business updates from Walt Disney and Comcast and as another powerful storm neared the United States. Gains in healthcare stocks helped stem the losses, while strength in Microsoft, Amazon and biotech Gilead kept the tech-heavy Nasdaq in positive territory. Comcast dropped 5.9 percent after the cable operator warned of subscriber losses, while Disney shares fell 5.0 percent after the company cautioned about its profit growth. The S&P; 500 media index was down 3.7 percent. Investors were also tracking Hurricane Irma, which was bearing down on Florida on the heels of devastation in Texas caused by Hurricane Harvey. Irma plowed past the Dominican Republic toward Haiti after devastating a string of Caribbean islands. With Irma looming, shares of insurers were weaker, with the Dow Jones U.S. Insurance index off 2.1 percent. “There’s further uncertainty because of Hurricane Irma that is supposed to be hitting Florida. You don’t know what kind of damage it is going to do,” said John Praveen, managing director at Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey. Combined with Harvey, in the short term, Praveen said, “maybe it will have a negative impact upon U.S. GDP growth and it might hurt U.S. earnings, and that’s probably why the markets are reacting negatively.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.72 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,764.92, the S&P; 500 lost 1.12 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,464.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.38 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,396.69. Irma is the latest macro event to keep selling pressure on U.S. equities following concerns earlier this week about geopolitical tensions involving North Korea, which sparked the biggest one-day drop for the S&P; 500 in about three weeks. Still, the benchmark S&P; remains near all-time highs, with market watchers pointing to strong earnings growth and solid economic data as helping to support stocks. Investors were also digesting comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, who said the euro’s strength was already weighing on inflation and will be a key factor for the ECB next month when it decides how to proceed with its massive stimulus program. General Electric shares sank 3.9 percent, dragging on the S&P; and the Dow, after a bearish analyst note. Apple shares also weighed on major indexes, falling 0.4 percent after a report that the company’s new iPhone was hit with production glitches. Financial shares slid 1.9 percent amid a drop in U.S. Treasury yields. Healthcare was the best-performing sector, rising 1.2 percent. AbbVie shares surged 6.3 percent and Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 5.6 after the drugmakers separately reported positive clinical updates on their respective medicines. Eli Lilly shares rose 1.9 percent after the drugmaker said it would lay off about 8 percent of its employees. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Comcast, like other pay-TV providers, is under pressure as viewing habits change and wants to leverage its infrastructure to grow in other ways.

Business services was the fastest growing segment in Comcast’s cable business last year, with revenue up 16.1 percent to $5.51 billion. “We’re constantly regarded as really the growth side of the business internally,” Stemper said. “Therefore, investments are in line with driving that type of growth.” The company has invested $6.2 billion in business services since 2010. Comcast’s customers have been mostly small and mid-size business, but the company wants to expand to larger enterprises, Stemper said. Comcast has also been expanding its home security business and is turning to home automation.

1146,CMCSA,Breakingviews - Comcast earns its peacock feathers,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast is earning its peacock feathers. The $170 billion U.S. media firm was early and careful expanding beyond cable. Two examples are its purchase of NBC Universal - originally with its peacock logo - and a recently launched wireless phone service. Comcast stock has trounced the shares of Verizon Communications and AT&T.; The company led by Brian Roberts has even pulled away from Walt Disney’s market value this year. Thursday’s earnings report confirmed that Comcast lost 125,000 TV subscribers in the third quarter due to competition and hurricanes, something it warned about earlier. That doesn’t detract much, though, from the longer-term picture. In 2004 Roberts, the chief executive, made a hostile lurch for Disney only to drop the bid. Comcast finally scored when it bought NBC Universal from General Electric in a two-part, $39 billion deal. The TV outfit’s former CEO, Bob Wright, groused in his book that GE, hobbled by the financial crisis, had given away the broadcaster for a song. He reckoned it was worth $45 billion. AT&T; has tried belatedly to follow. The telecom firm offered some $85 billion for HBO owner Time Warner in October last year and is still waiting for regulatory approval. It may have overpaid: Breakingviews calculated when the deal was announced that the expected $1 billion in cost savings won’t cover the hefty $20 billion premium. Comcast is prudently moving into other areas as well. It launched a mobile service using Verizon’s infrastructure, avoiding acquiring a carrier like T-Mobile US. That may yet be an option, but for the moment it’s mostly upside for Comcast as it dips into the cellphone business. Roberts has made mistakes. For one, he misjudged the political climate and had to drop a bid for Time Warner Cable, which Charter Communications scooped up. But investors have little to complain about. Since March 2013, when the NBC Universal deal was finally completed, Comcast’s total return, including dividends reinvested, of 96 percent beats the S&P; 500 Index and Disney on around 80 percent each. AT&T; and Verizon have managed only 15 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Comcast’s steady strategy is paying off.",10262017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-comcast-earns-its-peacock-feathers-idUSKBN1CV3DU
1147,CMCSA,Comcast quarterly revenue misses estimates,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) reported slightly lower-than-expected quarterly revenue on Thursday and said it lost video subscribers, while analysts raised questions about growth prospects for the No. 1 U.S. cable operator’s internet business. Comcast’s video business has been pressured as more consumers cancel their cable packages in favor of cheaper streaming options from companies like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O).  Video accounts for roughly 44 percent of revenue in the cable business, Comcast’s largest segment. AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) have also reported video subscriber losses. Shares of Comcast were down 0.2 percent at $36.75 at mid-afternoon after tumbling nearly 4 percent in premarket trading as investors shrugged off higher-than-expected earnings. The company said it lost 125,000 video subscribers in the third quarter. It said in September that it might lose up to 150,000 due to recent hurricanes and increased competition in the pay-TV industry.  Consumers now have more choices for streaming television over the internet at cheaper prices than cable. Such alternatives include Dish Network Corp’s (DISH.O) Sling service, Sony Corp’s (6758.T) PlayStation Vue and AT&T;’s DirecTV Now.  Comcast has said it is well-positioned for changes in viewing habits because of its high-speed internet, or broadband, business, which added 214,000 subscribers in the quarter.  But on a conference call, Wall Street analysts said that business’ growth had slowed. The company had added 330,000 broadband subscribers in the year-earlier period. The analysts asked how Comcast viewed the competitive landscape as rival AT&T; expands its fiber-based internet service into areas Comcast serves.  Chief Executive Brian Roberts said the company had anticipated AT&T;’s expansion. “Our view is to deliver the best product, period, and we will constantly increase speeds,” he said. “That’s why we’ve been so focused on Wi-Fi.” In May, Comcast introduced its cloud-based XFi service, which allows users to set up their home Wi-Fi, shut off children’s devices at bedtime and troubleshoot problems from an application on their mobile phones, website or television.     Roberts also said Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile service, which competes with wireless carriers like AT&T; and Verizon, had surpassed 250,000 customer lines since its introduction in May.  Net income attributable to Comcast rose 18.5 percent to $2.65 billion, or 55 cents a share.  Excluding special items, earnings per share came to 52 cents. Analysts on average had expected 50 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 1.6 percent to $20.98 billion from the year-earlier period, when the company’s NBC broadcast network benefited from the 2016 Olympics. Wall Street had forecast $21.04 billion.

1149,CMCSA,"Charter bleeds pay TV customers as Netflix, Hulu come knocking","(Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc’s (CHTR.O) shares sank on Thursday after it lost twice as many pay TV subscribers as expected, in the face of competition from Netflix and Hulu. The company’s profit fell nearly 75 percent as it lost 104,000 video customers in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average had expected 49,000, according to research firm FactSet. More and more consumers are deserting pay TV bundles for cheaper online streaming services, mounting pressure on traditional cable companies such as Charter and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O). Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), the world’s leading video streaming service, said last week it added 5.3 million subscribers in all its markets in the third quarter, beating Wall Street forecasts of 4.5 million. “It’s true that there are lots of pressures on the video bundle, the biggest pressure being price,” Charter Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge said on a call with analysts. Comcast, the No.1 U.S. cable operator, said on Thursday it lost 125,000 video subscribers in the third quarter, mainly due to the recent hurricanes and more competition in the pay TV industry. Comcast said last month it would lose 150,000 subscribers in the third quarter, sending its shares down 6 percent after the forecast. “When Comcast infamously cut their Q3 unit growth guidance in September, investors were quick to cut their numbers for Comcast. They were slower to adjust their numbers for Charter. They should have,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson Research. Stamford, Connecticut-based Charter also attributed a small number of its subscriber losses to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The downbeat results weighed on the cable sector, with shares of Altice USA Inc (ATUS.N) falling 6 percent, and Dish Network Corp’s (DISH.O) stock slipping 2 percent. Shares of Charter, which have risen about 20 percent this year, fell 8.5 percent to $315.81 in afternoon trading. Charter’s profit was also dented by a 37 percent surge in its capital expenditure to $2.39 billion. Net income attributable to shareholders fell nearly 75 percent to $48 million, or 19 cents per share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, total revenue rose 4.2 percent to $10.46 billion, as Charter signed up more subscribers for its internet services.

1158,CMCSA,Exclusive: Mattel snubs Hasbro's latest acquisition approach - sources,"(Reuters) - Mattel Inc has rebuffed Hasbro Inc’s latest takeover approach, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, casting uncertainty over the potential combination of the world’s two largest toy companies. Mattel’s rebuttal indicates that Margaret Georgiadis, who took over as the company’s chief executive in February, is seeking to drive a hard bargain in negotiations with Hasbro, even though Mattel’s stock has significantly underperformed that of Hasbro in the last year.   Mattel has informed Hasbro its proposal undervalues the company and does not take sufficiently into account the potential for regulators to reject the deal based on antitrust concerns, the sources said.  The terms Hasbro has proposed could not be learned, and it is not clear whether negotiations between the two companies will continue. The companies have engaged in multiple rounds of deal talks over the last two decades. The three sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Hasbro did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Mattel declined to comment. A combination of the two companies would create a toy powerhouse, uniting Hasbro’s My Little Pony, Monopoly and Nerf brands with Mattel’s Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toys. It would give Hasbro more pricing power to negotiate with entertainment studios over TV and movie franchises. Hasbro and Mattel have had talks several times over the years, including in 1996 and again sometime in late 2015. Hasbro’s more recent outreach to Mattel was from a position of strength. Before the Wall Street Journal reported Hasbro’s approach last week, Mattel shares were down 47 percent year-to-date, while Hasbro shares were up 18 percent. Mattel has a market capitalization of $6.3 billion, while Hasbro has a market capitalization of $11.8 billion. The September bankruptcy of Toys “R” Us, the biggest U.S. toy retailer, highlighted the struggles facing the sector, including online competition and children’s shifting preference for electronics over traditional toys. Mattel has pointed to that bankruptcy as a reason for weak sales. In June, Georgiadis outlined a new strategy for the company that called for expanding its brands and accelerating growth in emerging markets. Two weeks ago, the El Segundo, California-based company suspended its dividend and it would miss its full-year revenue forecast. Hasbro, which is trying to diversify its revenue stream, also sought to buy U.S. movie studio and entertainment company Lions Gate Entertainment Corp this year, but those talks ended without a deal, Reuters reported in August. That deal would have given Hasbro a direct pipeline into Hollywood, with more movies and TV shows tied to its toy brands. In 2014, Hasbro held merger discussions with DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc, the studio behind “Shrek,” but DreamWorks was subsequently bought by Comcast Corp.

1160,CMCSA,"Comcast, Verizon approached Twenty-First Century Fox to buy some assets: sources","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc have both expressed interest in acquiring a significant part of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s assets, two people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday. News of competing interest in some of Murdoch’s assets broke even though the U.S. Justice Department was preparing a lawsuit to block AT&T; Inc, the largest pay-TV provider in the United States, from buying Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion, according to a source. This raised questions about the U.S. government’s willingness to allow large media industry mergers. The Fox assets that buyers have expressed interest in  include Fox’s movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic, and international assets such as the Star network in India, and the European pay TV provider Sky Plc. These units have also been the subject of recent talks between Fox and Walt Disney Co, one of the sources said. Fox shares jumped nearly 8.0 percent in after-hours trading after the Wall Street Journal first reported the news.        Shares of Viacom Inc and CBS Corp also rose more than 2.0 percent, a sign investors may see them as potential targets also. Comcast has approached Fox about its interest, and talks are in early stages, the source added, requesting anonymity. There is no guarantee that talks between the companies will result in a deal.  Fox, Comcast and Verizon declined comment.  After Comcast first bought a stake in NBCUniversal in 2011, buying the Fox assets would give Comcast, the largest cable provider in the United States, an international distribution footprint through ownership of Sky and Star in India. Comcast has steadily boosted its ownership of content over the years and acquiring Fox’s assets would further position Comcast as a diversified conglomerate to rival Disney, analysts said.  The deal would bulk up its NBCUniversal unit, which acquired Dreamworks Animation for $3.8 billion last year, as well as increase its ownership stake in video streaming service Hulu.  Verizon is also in the early stages of exploring a deal, one of the sources said. A deal could give the U.S. No. 1 wireless phone carrier ownership of movies and TV shows to stream to its mobile subscribers.  Acquisition of a movie studio and cable channels would be a departure for Verizon, which has focused its media deals around advertising technology and internet properties.  Verizon spent $4.48 billion acquiring the core business of Yahoo, which it merged with AOL this year to form a venture called Oath. Led by AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, Oath owns more than 50 brands including HuffPost, TechCrunch and Tumblr.  Roger Entner, an analyst of Recon Analytics, said, “It is undeniable that there is a trend of combining content with distribution.”   Verizon, which has said it is launching a new streaming service, could have more targeted advertising with a vertically integrated platform, he added.  Traditional cable television networks have been struggling with faster-than-expected subscriber erosion in the competition with streaming services like Netflix Inc  and Amazon.com Inc.    To increase its scale, Fox tried to buy Time Warner Inc. three years ago and last year announced its intention to buy the rest of Sky beyond the 39 percent it already owns. The moves also come after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday voted to remove key roadblocks to increased consolidation among media companies, potentially unleashing new deals among TV, radio and newspaper owners as they seek to better compete with online media.

1165,CMCSA,Internet businesses ask U.S. to keep net neutrality rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AirBnb, Reddit, Shutterstock, Inc, Tumblr, Etsy (ETSY.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and a long list of small internet companies urged the Federal Communications Commission on Monday to scrap a plan to roll back net neutrality rules. In a letter dated on Monday, the companies urged FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to reverse course and vote against changing the rules. Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, unveiled plans last week to scrap landmark 2015 rules intended to ensure a free and open internet, moving to give broadband service providers sweeping power over what content consumers can access. The FCC is set to vote on Dec. 14. The move was seen as a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T; Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), which favored a repeal. The companies, which sent the letter on Cyber Monday to coincide with the biggest online shopping day of the year, argued that slowing access to content, called “throttling,” or blocking it altogether, would hurt the U.S. economy. “This would put small and medium-sized businesses at a disadvantage and prevent innovative new ones from even getting off the ground,” the companies said in the letter. Pai defended the change as a way to remove heavy-handed internet regulations. “The internet and companies like Twitter, which signed the letter, thrived under the pre-2015 light-touch regulatory framework that governed Internet access. Chairman Pai wants to return to that framework so that we can increase investment in broadband networks and connect more Americans to the services that these companies offer online,” FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield said in a statement.

1167,CMCSA,"UPDATE 2-U.S. FCC's Pai, addressing net neutrality rules, calls Twitter biased","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, accused social media company Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) of being politically biased on Tuesday as he defended his plan to roll back rules intended to ensure a free and open internet. Pai, a Republican named by President Donald Trump to head up the FCC, unveiled plans last week to scrap the 2015 landmark  net neutrality rules, moving to give broadband service providers sweeping power over what content consumers can access. “When it comes to an open internet, Twitter is part of the problem,” Pai said. “The company has a viewpoint and uses that viewpoint to discriminate.”  He pointed to Twitter’s refusal to let Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, advertise a campaign video with an anti-abortion message.      “To say the least, the company appears to have a double standard when it comes to suspending or de-verifying conservative users’ accounts as opposed to those of liberal users,” Pai said.  A spokesperson for Twitter said that at no time was Blackburn’s video censored and that her followers would have been able to still see it.  “Because advertisements are served to users who do not necessarily follow an account, we therefore have higher standards for their content,” the Twitter spokesperson said. Twitter in October declined a campaign video advertisement by Blackburn, who announced she is running for the U.S. Senate, saying that a remark by Blackburn about opposing abortion was inflammatory. Twitter later reversed its decision. Pai’s criticism came a day after Twitter and a number of other internet-based companies - including AirBnb, Reddit, Shutterstock, Inc, Tumblr and Etsy (ETSY.O) - sent a letter urging the FCC to maintain the net neutrality rules. Trump is a prolific user of Twitter, often posting his unvarnished thoughts on the news of the day. He used Twitter throughout his presidential campaign to circumvent traditional media and talk directly to voters.  Pai has also been a frequent user of the website - acknowledging during the speech, “I love Twitter” - to push his case in favor of the rule changes. On Tuesday afternoon, he even posted a link to his remarks critical of Twitter on his own Twitter account.  Following Pai’s remarks on Tuesday, at an event organized by the libertarian-leaning R Street Institute, two other FCC commissioners said they would support his proposal when they vote on Dec. 14.  The proposed rollback of net neutrality has been seen as a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T; Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), which favored a repeal. On the other side, websites such as Facebook (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google have favored the rules. The rules prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane,” to certain internet services over others. “So when you get past the wild accusations, fear mongering and hysteria, here’s the boring bottom line,” Pai said. “The plan to restore internet freedom would return us to the light touch, market-based approach under which the internet thrived.” ",11282017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-internet-pai/update-2-u-s-fccs-pai-addressing-net-neutrality-rules-calls-twitter-biased-idUSL1N1NY1UQ

Sources told Reuters last week that Disney was in the lead to acquire the assets, which include Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, the Star network in India and stake in European pay-TV provider Sky PLC. The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, prefers a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney stock than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, one of the sources said.  Comcast, the biggest cable provider in the United States, said in a statement on Monday that its discussions with Fox had ended. “When a set of assets like Fox’s becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.” The assets in question would have expanded Comcast’s international footprint through ownership of Sky and Star. A source told Reuters in mid-November that Comcast had approached Fox about its interest, and talks were in early stages. Disney’s negotiations with Fox are continuing, and a deal could be reached as early as this month, sources close to the situation said on Monday. The persons asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Disney did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Fox representative declined to comment. Any potential deal will follow the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision last month to sue to block AT&T; Inc’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc.

1170,CMCSA,U.S. agency prepares to hand over internet oversight to FTC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission plans to turn over oversight of internet service providers to another federal agency as it plans to vote on Thursday to revoke the landmark 2015 “net neutrality” rules. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month unveiled plans to repeal the rules that prohibit internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content. The 2015 rules bar broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to web content. On Monday, the FCC and Federal Trade Commission said they plan to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to coordinate efforts under the new rules. The agencies said the  proposal will “return jurisdiction to the FTC to police the conduct of ISPs.” Pai said Monday in a statement the agencies “will work together to take targeted action against bad actors.” Under Pai’s proposal, the FCC would no longer bar any specific internet provider practice but require companies to disclose if they block, throttle or offer paid prioritization of internet traffic. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said the agreement “is a confusing, lackluster, reactionary afterthought: an attempt to paper over weaknesses in the chairman’s draft proposal repealing the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules.” The FTC will investigate if internet providers fail to make accurate disclosures or if they engage in deceptive or unfair acts or practices. “The FTC is committed to ensuring that Internet service providers live up to the promises they make to consumers,” said Acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said “FTC enforcement would happen long after the fact — many months, if not years, after consumers and businesses have been harmed.” Chris Lewis, vice president of advocacy group Public Knowledge, said the FCC is “joining forces with the FTC to say it will only act when a broadband provider is deceiving the public. This gives free reign to broadband providers to block or throttle your broadband service as long as they inform you.” Democrats and net neutrality advocates plan a series of protests ahead of Thursday’s vote. Pai’s proposal has already won the backing of the three Republicans on the five-member commission. The reversal represents a victory for big internet providers such as AT&T; Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) that opposed the 2015 rules. Pai’s proposal is opposed by large internet companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O). The new rules are expected to take effect in January and draw court challenges.

Several states including New York, and public interest advocacy groups have said they intend to sue to stop the mid-December ruling by the Federal Communications Commission. The approval of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal in a 3-2 vote marked a victory for internet service providers such as AT&T; Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), handing them power over what content consumers can access.

This rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,” the Internet Association said in a statement. Etsy called the decision to overturn net neutrality rules “deeply disappointing.”  “Etsy is continuing to fight for a free and open Internet; that’s why we intend to challenge Chairman Pai’s order in the courts,” Althea Erickson, Etsy’s head of advocacy and impact, said in a statement.

1180,CMCSA,Tivo hits Comcast with new round of patent lawsuits," (This January 11 story was refiled to correct typo in “scheduling” in paragraph 6) By Jan  Wolfe (Reuters) - Tivo Corp (TIVO.O) has again sued cable operator Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) of using its patented interactive programming technology without authorization, the latest salvo in the companies’ long-running royalty dispute. Tivo filed lawsuits in Boston and Los Angeles on Wednesday, saying Comcast’s X1 video recording system infringed on patents describing functionality like pausing and resuming shows on different devices and restarting live programming in progress. A pioneer in digital video recording technology, Tivo said on Thursday that it also planned to sue Comcast at the U.S. International Trade Commission, a government agency that can hear patent disputes and ban infringing products from entering the country. Comcast said in a statement that it independently created its X1 products and that it would aggressively defend itself against the lawsuits, calling them an attempt by Tivo to make money from an “aging and increasingly obsolete patent portfolio.” Tivo subsidiary Rovi Corp sued Comcast in federal court in Texas and at the ITC in April 2016 after the cable operator declined to renew a long-standing agreement to license the company’s patents. That deal, reached 13 years ago and valued at $250 million, expired in March 2016, according to a Tivo court filing. The ITC ruled in November that Comcast’s X1 platform infringed on two Tivo patents describing a system for scheduling recordings through a smartphone app. The agency said four other Tivo patents were not infringed. Comcast said it would remove the scheduling feature, which only a small percentage of customers used, so it could continue to offer X1 to customers while it appealed the ITC’s ruling. JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said in a November research note that the ruling could prompt Comcast to resolve the lawsuits through a new licensing agreement. San Carlos, California-based Tivo was one of the first DVR makers but in recent years has focused on licensing its patent portfolio. The patents at issue in Wednesday’s lawsuits were originally granted to Rovi, a provider of digital television guides that merged with Tivo in 2016, and its Andover, Massachusetts-based subsidiary Veveo Inc.

1187,CMCSA,Comcast tops profit estimates even as it sheds video subscribers,"NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s adjusted quarterly profit topped Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, helped by more high-speed internet customers and higher theme park revenue. Excluding impacts from a $12.7 billion one-time benefit following the U.S. tax overhaul signed into law in December, earnings per share were 49 cents, beating analyst estimates of 47 cents per share. But the biggest U.S. cable provider said it lost 33,000 video customers in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to an addition of 80,000 last year. Comcast’s video business has been pressured as more consumers cancel their cable packages in favor of cheaper streaming options from companies like Netflix Inc . Revenue rose 4.2 percent to $21.92 billion from the year-earlier period, roughly in line with analyst expectations of $21.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Comcast rose to $15.0 billion, or $3.17 per share, for the quarter, up from $2.3 billion, or 48 cents per share. The company was able to book a gain on its deferred tax bill thanks to newly lowered U.S. corporate tax rates. Revenue rose 3.4 percent in the cable business, which includes video, internet and voice services. Comcast added 350,000 high-speed internet customers in the quarter, compared with a gain of 385,000 the same period a year earlier. NBCUniversal’s revenue rose 3.9 percent in the quarter, helped by the segment’s theme parks business.

1188,CMCSA,"CORRECTED-Digital publishers ramp up TV push to nab viewers, ad dollars","(Reuters) - Online media companies ATTN:, BuzzFeed and Group Nine Media are making a bigger push into television, executives said, aiming to grab more of the TV advertising market and depend less on social media for viewers.    While the companies have long lured audiences through social media like Facebook Inc, that has made them vulnerable to changes that could bury their content. TV also offers the opportunity for revenue from licensing shows domestically and abroad.   Three-year-old ATTN:, which draws more than half of viewers for its videos on current events from Facebook, is in development on two pilots. It has sold a pilot of a documentary-style news show to CBS Corp’s Showtime and is co-producing a series called “America Versus” with Paramount Television, the television studio owned by Viacom Inc, Matt Segal, ATTN:’s chief executive, told Reuters. As digital media becomes more competitive, television is a crucial next step for companies like BuzzFeed, which announced layoffs for 100 employees last year amid reports it missed revenue targets, executives said.  Group Nine and BuzzFeed already have shows on air or scheduled with networks owned by their respective investors Discovery Communications and Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal, and are now pitching pilots to other networks, executives told Reuters. Facebook recently changed its news feed to favor posts from friends and family of its more than 2 billion users over content shared by publishers, underscoring the risk of depending too much on third-party social media. “Our weakness is we don’t own those platforms and that’s just the reality,” said Ben Lerer, CEO of New York-based Group Nine, which owns travel brand Thrillist, video news creator NowThis and animal video site The Dodo. “This is a way of gaining revenue outside of that ecosystem.” Television also offers a much more lucrative advertising market, executives said, even as viewers increasingly cancel cable subscriptions in favor of online streaming services like Netflix Inc.  Spending on TV spots is expected to be $72 billion this year, compared to $15.4 billion for digital ad spending, according to market researcher eMarketer. Los Angeles-based ATTN: always planned to get into TV and expects to bring in seven figures of ad revenue this year if its pilots get picked up, said Segal.  Segal declined to comment on how much ad revenue the company brings in now, but said it would also earn fees from licensing shows to partners in the United States and abroad. “Television is going to bring us more ad revenue and brand lift,” he said.  Vice Media was the first digital media company to get into TV with its own show on HBO, as well as its own channel, Viceland. Vice News Tonight brought in on average 174,000 viewers between the ages of 18-49 in 2017, compared to 130,000 the previous year, according to Nielsen.   ATTN:’s pilot with Showtime is a documentary-style series that addresses topics like politics, socioeconomics, and the war on drugs.  “America Versus,” ATTN:’s show it is developing with Paramount Television, will take topics like binge drinking and look at them in the United States versus other countries, Segal said. Group Nine’s The Dodo will premier its first TV series, “Dodo Heroes,” featuring people who save animals in need, with Discovery’s Animal Planet this year.  BuzzFeed is shopping a game show to a number of broadcast networks, which would be the first time it has a show outside of NBC networks, said Matthew Henick, head of BuzzFeed Motion Pictures. BuzzFeed recently announced a documentary series with NBC’s Oxygen network. “It used to be with digital you were just hoping to work within an algorithm where viewers are going to go,” Henick said. “Now people know what to expect if they go to a BuzzFeed News show.” (This version of the story corrects paragraph 3 to show that ATTN: is working with Paramount Television, not Paramount Network) ",1252018,http://www.reuters.com/article/television-digital/corrected-digital-publishers-ramp-up-tv-push-to-nab-viewers-ad-dollars-idUSL1N1PE1G6

1193,CMCSA,"Super Bowl draws 103 million viewers, down 7 percent from 2017","(Reuters) - Sunday’s historic Super Bowl victory by the Philadelphia Eagles averaged 103.4 million viewers on U.S. television network NBC, a 7 percent drop from last year’s football championship game, according to Nielsen ratings data released on Monday. The viewership on NBC, which is owned by Comcast Corp, ranked as the lowest for U.S. television’s premiere event since 2009. Still, the decline was smaller than the 10 percent falloff for National Football League games during the regular season.  The underdog Eagles upset the New England Patriots 41-33 to win their first Super Bowl title in franchise history. NBC said the contest was the 10th-biggest television broadcast in history. New England won last year’s Super Bowl in a thrilling overtime victory over the Atlanta Falcons, drawing 111.3 million viewers on Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s Fox broadcast network. About 3 million more people watched this year’s Super Bowl live on digital platforms such as NFL.com or apps from NBC Sports, Verizon Communications Inc and Yahoo Sports, NBC said. That made the game the most live-streamed Super Bowl ever. Ratings for NFL games have been closely watched after two straight years of declines during the regular season. Among factors cited by analysts are an overall drop in television viewing and divisive player protests over racial inequality.  Advertisers including Anheuser Busch InBev, Amazon.com Inc and Toyota Motor Corp spent more than $5 million on average for each 30-second commercial spot during Sunday’s game. Total spending by brands during the broadcast hit $414 million, the second-highest amount in history, according to a preliminary estimate from research firm Kantar Media. Commercials took up more than 49 minutes, or 22 percent, of the game, Kantar said. NBC said 106.6 million people on average watched Sunday’s halftime show featuring singer Justin Timberlake. A new episode of family drama “This is Us,” which followed the Super Bowl, brought in 27 million viewers, the most-watched scripted show on NBC in more than 13 years.

1194,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-Big Tech backs U.S. congressional vote to keep the net neutral,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Technology companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) on Thursday threw their weight behind a congressional bid to reverse the Trump administration’s plan to repeal Obama-era rules designed to protect an open internet. U.S. Senate Democrats said last month they had the backing of 50 members of the 100-person chamber for a reversal of the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) plan, leaving them just one vote short of a majority. The FCC voted along party lines in December to repeal net neutrality regulations. Those rules, introduced in 2015, were lauded by tech companies and consumer groups but denounced by internet service providers as hindering investment.  The Internet Association, which represents Google’s parent, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and many others, said in a letter on Thursday to Senate leaders that it backed the Senate effort to reverse the vote, but also called for a long-term fix. “The internet industry urges Congress to legislate a permanent solution,” the group said in the letter made public on Thursday. “The time has come for a bipartisan effort to establish permanent net neutrality rules.” A public backlash against the FCC’s plan, especially among younger people, has raised concerns among some politicians about how the issue might play out in the 2018 congressional elections. More than 20 U.S. state attorneys general are also mounting a legal challenge of the FCC’s vote to reverse the rules introduced in 2015 that prevent internet providers, such as AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), from obstructing information they transmit to customers or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization.  While the FCC reversal will lift those restrictions on providers, a future FCC could reimpose them and internet providers have also urged Congress to write new laws to end a decade-long dispute over the future of the internet. Democrats have shown little interest in working to write new rules. Internet companies say that without net neutrality protection, many Americans will have little recourse. The letter on Thursday said that “more than half of all Americans have no choice in their provider, and 87 percent of rural Americans have no choice.” USTelecom, which represents AT&T;, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and other phone companies, said “we couldn’t agree more that Congress needs to engage on (net neutrality) to craft a bill that addresses the key issues, includes all players in the ecosystem and finally resolves the disruptive policy back and forth.” ",2082018,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-internet/update-2-big-tech-backs-u-s-congressional-vote-to-keep-the-net-neutral-idUSL2N1PY1B2

Comcast may decide not to make any new offer, the sources said. Its decision will be informed by how Fox justifies the deal with Disney in a regulatory filing to its shareholders sometime before they are asked to vote on the deal this summer, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Comcast, Disney and Fox gave no immediate comment. Comcast might be prepared to offer protections to Fox such as agreeing to remove certain assets from the deal that prove controversial in Washington, D.C., including regional sports channels, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on Comcast’s deliberations. It was is possible that instead of re-engaging in pursuit of all of Fox assets, Comcast could zero in on something in particular, such as European pay TV giant Sky, the Wall Street Journal report said, citing anonymous sources.

Disney struck a deal with Fox to buy film, television and international businesses.

1199,CMCSA,Time Warner a good investment despite merger uncertainty -investor,"(Reuters) - Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) stock is an attractive investment despite uncertainty surrounding its pending deal with AT&T; Inc (T.N), according to a prominent investor.  “It’s hard to find a more compelling opportunity than Time Warner,” said Samantha Greenberg, chief investment officer at New York-based hedge fund Margate Capital at a Reuters event on Tuesday.  The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block AT&T;’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner, struck more than 15 months ago, on the grounds it would raise prices for consumers and rivals. A trial to decide the matter begins in March.  Time Warner shares are a good investment regardless of the outcome, Greenberg told attendees of Reuters Breakingviews’ “No Safe Spaces for Big Media” panel. “They have been in deal hell and their stock has massively underperformed the S&P; 500,” Greenberg said. Time Warner trades at about 11.5 times earnings projected for this year, she said, a touch over the sector average. Even if AT&T; does not win its case against the Justice Department, other buyers will likely emerge, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Greenberg said.  The panel focused on consolidation in the media sector as programmers and distributors try to prevent viewers cancelling their cable and satellite subscriptions to watch shows on online services provided by Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which are spending billions of dollars on content.  “Linear TV is in trouble,” said James Murray, a partner at PJT partners, a New York-based investment bank. Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) announced a $52.4 billion deal to buy the majority of Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O)’s assets. But Comcast Corp, which had also bid for the Fox assets, is considering making a new bid for them, sources have told Reuters.  Just this month, Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) and CBS Corp (CBS.N) announced they were  exploring a merger. Panelists said they expect technology companies such as Apple and Amazon to acquire movie or TV studios this year. “Technology companies will go for the small pure plays,” said Julius Genachowski, partner and managing director at The Carlyle Group.

1202,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-States refile lawsuits to block repeal of U.S. net neutrality,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of 22 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia on Thursday refiled legal challenges intended to block the Trump administration’s repeal of landmark rules designed to ensure a free and open internet from taking effect. The Federal Communications Commission officially published its order overturning the net neutrality rules in the Federal Register on Thursday, a procedural step that allows for the filing of legal challenges.  The states, along with Web browser developer Mozilla Corp and video-sharing website Vimeo Inc (IAC.O), had filed petitions preserving their right to sue in January, but agreed to withdraw them last Friday and wait for the FCC’s publication. The Republican-led FCC in December voted 3-2 to overturn 2015 rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content on the internet. “Repealing net neutrality will allow internet service providers to put corporate profits over consumers by controlling what we see, do, and say online,” said New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, who is leading the coalition. Other members of the group include California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The attorneys general argue that the FCC cannot make “arbitrary and capricious” changes to existing policies and that it misinterpreted and disregarded “critical record evidence on industry practices and harm to consumers and businesses.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is confident the order will be upheld, his office said in a statement. The White House Office of Management and Budget still must sign off on some aspects of the FCC reversal before it takes legal effect. That could take months. Congressional aides say the publication will trigger a 60-legislative-day deadline for Congress to vote on whether to overturn the FCC’s decision. U.S. Senate Democrats, who hold 49 seats in the 100-person chamber, have the backing of 50 senators for repeal, leaving them one vote short of a majority. Democrats need 51 votes to win any proposal in the Republican-controlled Senate because Vice President Mike Pence can break any tie. Even if Democrats do win a Senate majority, reinstatement of net neutrality would also require a favorable vote in the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a larger majority, and would still be subject to a likely veto by President Donald Trump.  The repeal of the net neutrality rules was a victory for internet service providers like AT&T; Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), conferring power over what content consumers can access. On the other side, technology companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) have thrown their weight behind the congressional bid to reverse the net neutrality repeal. The FCC December order also seeks to pre-empt states from imposing their own net neutrality rules. But governors in Vermont, Hawaii, Montana, New Jersey and New York have signed orders pledging to do business only with internet providers that abide by net neutrality rules.

Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said last week the office agreed to withdraw “the original petition and will simply refile it once the final rule is published. Either way, our coalition of AGs is taking the FCC to court to challenge its illegal rollback of net neutrality.” The repeal was a victory for internet service providers like AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, conferring power over what content consumers can access.

1204,CMCSA,Comcast's $31 billion Sky bid crashes Murdoch and Disney show,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) has offered $31 billion for Sky Plc (SKYB.L), threatening a plan hatched by Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to seize control of Europe’s biggest pay-TV group. The world’s biggest entertainment company and owner of NBC and Universal Pictures said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain’s Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Murdoch’s Fox has agreed to pay for it. Bob Iger’s Disney has agreed to buy Sky from Fox, along with other assets, in a separate $52 billion follow-up deal. Comcast’s all-cash, unsolicited offer pits CEO Brian Roberts against Murdoch, the 86-year-old tycoon who helped to launch Sky and pioneered pay-TV in Britain. Iger is also a long-time rival after Comcast tried and failed to buy Disney in 2004. “Sky and Comcast are a perfect fit: we are both leaders in creating and distributing content,” Roberts said. Sky’s shares jumped more than 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, indicating that investors expect a bidding war. Shares of Comcast, Fox and Disney fell.  Comcast’s appearance in the already complex Sky drama could prompt Fox to make a higher offer or Disney to make its own direct bid for Sky. Fox remains committed to its cash offer announced in December, it said in a statement.     Media owners have been forced into increasingly aggressive deals after online groups Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) prompted many customers to ditch subscriptions.  Comcast bid $60 billion last year to clinch a deal with Fox, before losing out to Disney.  Sky, which provides sports programming, films and broadband to 23 million homes across Britain, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria, urged its investors to take no action since the approach did not represent a firm offer.  Murdoch’s Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been repeatedly held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain. The shares had been trading above the asking price since  Sky this month agreed to pay less than expected for Premier League soccer rights, likely boosting its future earnings and prompting investors to demand a higher offer. It also attracted the attention of U.S. hedge fund and activist investor Elliott Management Corp, which has built up a 2.5 percent stake in Sky in recent weeks.   Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch who holds 1 percent of Sky, said he expected a counter offer and speculated whether Disney could make a direct bid for Sky to avoid Fox’s regulatory problems. “Once you’re in a bidding war, it’s not about fair value, it’s about what do you think it’s worth,” Odey added.  Formed in 1990, Sky has built its business by offering leading content and technology. It snapped up Murdoch’s pay-TV groups across Europe in 2014 to offer a distribution platform that is now proving attractive to the big U.S. content owners.       Comcast said it had not yet engaged with Sky over the proposal and its finance director, Michael Cavanagh, declined to comment on whether it could lead to a renewed bid for Fox. Comcast will have to gain the support of Sky’s independent directors if it does not make a hostile bid because its chairman is Murdoch’s son James, who is also CEO of Fox. Comcast’s Roberts, the son of Ralph who founded the company in 1963, called Sky’s Deputy Chairman Martin Gilbert on Tuesday morning to notify him just before the offer statement was released, and called Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch shortly afterwards. Sky’s independent directors are expected to meet in the coming days to discuss the offer and the company said they were mindful of their duties to investors. Comcast went public with the proposal to trigger the regulatory timetable because timing will be a key factor. A Comcast spokesman said it would ask regulators in Brussels to look at the deal where it expects to avoid a lengthy investigation. Britain’s media minister has said he will give his verdict on Fox’s bid for Sky by June 14, giving Comcast a narrow window to get any takeover approval done.  “We would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50 percent of the Sky shares,” Roberts said. Disney’s Iger declined to comment when asked about the Comcast offer during a trip to Paris.  Murdoch had been edging towards a deal for Sky in recent weeks, eight years after he first tried to buy the company. Britain’s competition regulator said in January his planned takeover should be blocked unless a way was found to prevent the Australian-born power-broker from influencing Sky’s news operation. Critics, including many politicians, argue Murdoch wields too much influence through the Sun and Times newspapers, and in 2011 he closed the News of the World after its journalists admitted hacking phones to get scoops.   Seeking to prove it would not influence Sky News in the future, Fox last week promised to maintain and fund a fully independent Sky-branded news service for 10 years. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s ministers have appeared wary of approving Murdoch’s bid, repeatedly asking the independent regulator to intervene, and Comcast could face a smoother ride. A spokesman for May said the deal was a commercial matter. Robey Warshaw, a small boutique firm which has worked on some of Britain’s biggest deals, Evercore (EVR.N) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) are advising Comcast.

1205,CMCSA,UPDATE 8-Comcast's $31 bln Sky bid crashes Murdoch and Disney show,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) has offered $31 billion for Sky Plc (SKYB.L), threatening a plan hatched by Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to seize control of Europe’s biggest pay-TV group. The world’s biggest entertainment company and owner of NBC and Universal Pictures said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain’s Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Murdoch’s Fox has agreed to pay for it. Bob Iger’s Disney has agreed to buy Sky from Fox, along with other assets, in a separate $52 billion follow-up deal. Comcast’s all-cash, unsolicited offer pits CEO Brian Roberts against Murdoch, the 86-year-old tycoon who helped to launch Sky and pioneered pay-TV in Britain. Iger is also a long-time rival after Comcast tried and failed to buy Disney in 2004. “Sky and Comcast are a perfect fit: we are both leaders in creating and distributing content,” Roberts said. Sky’s shares jumped more than 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, indicating that investors expect a bidding war. Shares of Comcast, Fox and Disney fell.  Comcast’s appearance in the already complex Sky drama could prompt Fox to make a higher offer or Disney to make its own direct bid for Sky. Fox remains committed to its cash offer announced in December, it said in a statement.     Media owners have been forced into increasingly aggressive deals after online groups Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) prompted many customers to ditch subscriptions.  Comcast bid $60 billion last year to clinch a deal with Fox, before losing out to Disney.  Sky, which provides sports programming, films and broadband to 23 million homes across Britain, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria, urged its investors to take no action since the approach did not represent a firm offer.  Murdoch’s Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been repeatedly held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain.

1206,CMCSA,Senate Democrats push for support to reinstate net neutrality,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats launched efforts on Tuesday to win a vote to reinstate Obama-era rules guaranteeing an open internet, suggesting it would be a major issue in the 2018 mid-term elections. Democrats remain one Republican senator shy of winning a majority in the Senate to reverse the Federal Communications Commission’s order to undo the 2015 open internet rules. Even then the effort would not likely pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives or survive a veto by President Donald Trump.  The FCC in December voted 3-2 to reverse Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain online content.  The new FCC rules, once effective, would give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but include new transparency requirements that require them to disclose any changes to consumers. Last week, a coalition of 22 state attorneys general refiled legal challenges intended to block the Trump administration’s repeal of net neutrality. The FCC published its order overturning net neutrality last week, a procedural step that allows for the filing of legal challenges. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has said often he is confident the order will be upheld. The repeal of the net neutrality rules was a victory for internet service providers like AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, conferring power over what content consumers can access. On the other side, technology companies including Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc have thrown their weight behind the congressional bid to reverse the repeal.    Democrats said on Tuesday that the issue would be big in the mid-term election, especially among younger internet-savvy voters.     New York Senator Charles Schumer, the Democratic leader, suggested that under the FCC’s approach internet providers could block a young couple from watching Netflix programming or a college student watching an educational video. Schumer said Americans should blame Republicans for slow internet service “while Democrats fought to fix it.”  Republicans have said the FCC vote would eliminate heavy-handed government regulations, encourage investment and return the internet to pre-2015 rules. Under Senate rules, the earliest the Senate could vote on the issue is March 15 and they must seek a vote by June 20. Senator Edward Markey, the chief sponsor, said Democrats are undecided on when they would force a vote. Democrats, who control 49 seats in the 100-person chamber, have the backing of 50 senators for repeal, leaving them one vote short of a majority. Democrats need 51 votes to win any proposal in the Republican-controlled Senate because Vice President Mike Pence can break any tie.

1207,CMCSA,US STOCKS-Wall St sinks as Powell's comments fuel rate worries,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks suffered on Tuesday their biggest daily drops since the selloff three weeks ago after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell revived fears about more interest-rate increases than expected this year. Powell gave an upbeat view on the U.S. economy and said data has strengthened his confidence on inflation. Traders boosted bets the central bank will squeeze in a fourth rate hike this year following the remarks. Bond yields also rose, while the Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility of the S&P; 500 index, rose 2.79 points to 18.59, its largest one-day gain also in nearly three weeks. Powell’s first semi-annual economic testimony as Fed chief before the U.S. Congress comes at a sensitive time for the market, which had been trying to recover from the recent selloff, which confirmed the market was in a correction, or down 10 percent from a Jan. 26 record high. Fears over rising rates in part had sparked the selloff. In his prepared remarks, Powell hinted that the central bank would stick to its current path of gradual rate hikes, but his comments during congressional testimony seemed to spook the market. “He said it’s his impression the economy was getting stronger, which subtly gave the indication that he was going to raise his personal forecast for four rate hikes this year,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates next month and in December signaled a total of three rate hikes this year. Fed officials will release new forecasts, including their views on the appropriate future path of rate hikes, when they meet next month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 299.24 points, or 1.16 percent, to 25,410.03, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 35.32 points, or 1.27 percent, to 2,744.28 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 91.11 points, or 1.23 percent, to 7,330.35. Indexes posted their biggest daily percentage losses since Feb. 8.  “Sure enough, rates here have moved up a little bit as well, probably a little bit more so here based on his testimony, but I don’t think we are in a danger zone or anything of a spike in rate hikes by the Fed,” said Mark Kepner, managing director, sales and trading in Chatham, New Jersey.  Comcast (CMCSA.O) fell 7.4 percent after the U.S. cable giant offered to buy Sky (SKYB.L) for $31 billion in an unsolicited approach, taking on Rupert Murdoch’s Fox and Bob Iger’s Walt Disney in the battle for Europe’s biggest pay-TV group. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500. Disney (DIS.N) dropped 4.5 percent and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) fell 3 percent following the news. Macy’s (M.N) rose 3.5 percent after reporting higher-than-expected same-store sales growth for the fourth quarter. The biggest U.S. department store chain said sales at established stores could mark their first annual gain in four years. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 44 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 50 new lows.   About 7.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

1209,CMCSA,Comcast CEO eyes global pay-TV crown with Sky bid,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) would become the world’s largest pay-TV operator if CEO Brian Roberts’ $31-billion bid for Sky Plc (SKYB.L) succeeds, more than doubling its subscribers and expanding its international presence as growth slows in its core U.S. market. Little known in Europe, Philadelphia-based Comcast is the biggest U.S. cable operator, owning broadcasters NBC, CNBC and MSNBC. It also owns movie studio Universal Pictures, home to “Minions” and “Jason Bourne” movies and some theme parks.  A deal with Sky would help diversify its revenue as more U.S. customers cancel their cable packages in favor of cheaper streaming options from companies like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Comcast lost 33,000 video customers last quarter alone.. Comcast would immediately become the world’s largest pay-TV operator with 52 million “customer relationships,” if the deal went ahead, according to Macquarie analysts, adding Sky’s 23 million subscribers to its own customer base.  That would almost double the company’s reach and give it cross-border presence in Britain, Germany and Italy as well as the United States. The figure of 52 million is still dwarfed by Netflix’s 118 million worldwide subscribers. If the deal went ahead, international revenue would make up 25 percent of Comcast’s total, up from 9 percent currently, according to the company. A key gain for Comcast would be Sky’s success earlier this month in winning the rights to show Premier League soccer matches for a fee well below analyst expectations, likely a boost to future earnings. Comcast offered 12.50 pounds in cash per Sky share on Tuesday, well above the 10.75 pounds Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) - run by Roberts’ rival Rupert Murdoch - had agreed to pay for the British company.  That complicates Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) $52-billion deal to buy a range of Fox assets, including Sky, which was based on the assumption that Fox would complete its purchase. Investors and analysts met Comcast’s offer for Europe’s biggest pay-TV broadcaster with some skepticism, sending Comcast shares down 6 percent on Tuesday. Disney shares were also down 3.7 percent. Sky shares jumped 20 percent.  A Sky deal would provide additional channels for Comcast-owned content in Europe but also tie it further to satellite distribution, a technology growing obsolete in the United States, said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. The all-cash deal would likely limit Comcast’s share buybacks, said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co, which owns 3.35 million Comcast shares.  “There was a fair amount of hedge fund ownership that was expecting accelerated buybacks,” said Smith, addressing Comcast’s share drop on Tuesday. “If that was your thesis for owning Comcast that’s going to be on hold for now. There’s also concern that this becomes a bidding war.” Such a bidding war could mean that if Disney wants to block Comcast and own all of Sky, it would have to pay more than 14 pounds a share, according to a note on Tuesday by London-based Square Global Markets.  Roberts, 58, took over as head of Comcast from his father, Ralph, who founded the company in 1963. The younger Roberts became Comcast’s president in 1990 and CEO in 2002, having spent his whole career at the company. Any deal would raise Roberts’ profile as one of the most powerful media leaders. He brokered the 2001 deal with AT&T; Broadband that turned the cable company into a national player. He led Comcast’s failed effort to buy Disney for $54 billion in 2004. His $37-billion deal in 2009 to combine General Electric Co’s (GE.N) NBCUniversal business and Comcast’s cable networks put him in charge of more than 20 million subscribers of video, internet and voice services, the broadcast network known for “Friends” and “Seinfeld,” plus theme parks and the film studio. When Roberts was weighing an offer for Sky, a trip to see Sky’s products in store, and the knowledge of the London taxi driver that took him there, helped to make up his mind. “The cab driver was incredibly knowledgeable about the difference between Virgin and Sky in every feature,” Roberts told reporters on Tuesday. “We were learning a lot there. Then when we went to the Sky store, we spent at least an hour going through every feature and comparing it to our own... We were really terribly impressed.”  Liberty Global-owned (LBTYA.O) Virgin Media is a British rival to Sky. The CEO said the visit was one of a number of things that confirmed his company should try to acquire Sky. “Seeing it again, and listening to the passion of the sales and looking at the product... all those things combined to reinforce what a number of us have known for years - that this is a jewel,” said Roberts. “Frankly there’s nothing as great in the United States.”  ",2272018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-comcast-taxi/comcast-ceo-eyes-global-pay-tv-crown-with-sky-bid-idUSKCN1GB1J6

But (the Fed) is still going to be data dependent,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. Powell’s first semi-annual economic testimony as Fed chief before the U.S. Congress comes at a sensitive time for the market, which has swayed wildly in recent weeks on inflation worries. “Both stocks and bonds are reacting to the testimony that the Fed isn’t going to be deterred from its agenda based on short-term volatility in stocks,” said Oliver Pursche, vice chairman and chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. The CBOE Volatility index, better known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped to 17.36 points, posting it biggest gain in more than two weeks. At 12:30 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.42 percent at 25,601.84. The S&P; 500 fell 0.63 percent to 2,761.95 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.84 percent to 7,359.46. Comcast fell 6.3 percent after the U.S. cable giant offered to buy Sky for $31 billion in an unsolicited approach, taking on Rupert Murdoch’s Fox and Bob Iger’s Walt Disney in the battle for Europe’s biggest pay-TV group. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P; consumer discretionary, which fell 1.46 percent. Disney dropped 4 percent and Twenty-First Century Fox 2.6 percent following the news. Macy’s rose 4.6 percent after reporting higher-than-expected same-store sales growth for the fourth quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,114 to 767.

1213,CMCSA,Britain's FTSE little changed as Sky soars on Comcast bid,"(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) * FTSE 100 down 0.1 pct * Sky soars 20.5 pct, ITV up 1 pct * Persimmon up 4.7 pct By Tom Pfeiffer LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Comcast’s bid for pay-TV group Sky and strong results from housebuilder Persimmon helped keep Britain’s FTSE 100 on an even keel on Tuesday, as investors digested the first public comments from new Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. Market reaction over Powell’s nod to “gradual” rate increases was muted. “Gradual” has been the operative word since the Fed began raising rates under Powell’s predecessor, Janet Yellen, in late 2015. Britain’s top share index closed down 0.1 percent, with Sky soaring 20.5 percent as investors priced in a possible bidding war for the company following Comcast’s surprise move. Rival broadcaster ITV rose 1 percent. The offer from the $184 billion U.S. media giant could scupper the plans of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox to buy out Sky and sell it to Walt Disney. That takeover has already been delayed by concerns for media plurality in Britain and whether Murdoch would be a “fit and proper” owner of such an important broadcaster. “Remember there is a $1.5 billion break Fox have to pay if the Fox/Disney deal breaks,” said from Neil Campling, Co-Head of the Global Thematic Group at Mirabaud Securities. “There is no way we can see that Fox will walk away given how advanced the regulatory clearance process is. This bid marks a floor not an end to this particular saga. Let the battle commence.” Not everyone agreed, with Liberum analysts doubting Fox or Disney would get into a bidding war. Investec said Disney may decide it has “enough to do in the U.S. versus a contested European bid process. Standard Chartered rose 1.2 percent after it joined rival UK banks in resuming dividend payments as profits soared, though weaker than expected revenue kept investor exuberance in check. Gains were seen among housebuilders after Persimmon announced a more than doubling of dividend payments, a 25 percent jump in profits and a 7 percent increase in reservation rates. Concerns over a downturn in the housing market have weighed on the industry in recent months, with a decline in mortgage approvals and the Bank of England raising benchmark interest rates. Persimmon was forced to scale back its management bonus plan this week after widespread criticism that it could have netted bosses more than 200 million pounds from share options. The cash return plan unveiled on Tuesday would make Persimmon the second-highest yielding housebuilding stock, said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. “Persimmon has gone a long way to calming at least one unhappy party by showering investors in the stock with a cash windfall of their own,” said Mould. Persimmon rose 4.7 percent, with Berkeley and Taylor Wimpey both up 0.8 percent. Troubled subprime lender Provident Financial saw its shares surge 70.4 percent to their highest in six months after the company said it would raise 331 million pounds via a rights issue. Three traders said the smaller-than-expected cash call had set off a short-squeeze as hedge funds attempt to cover their positions. The stock is the most shorted of any UK company.

1214,CMCSA,Comcast informally tells Brussels of intention to bid for Sky,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast (CMCSA.O) has informally notified the European Commission of its intention to bid for Britain’s pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L), triggering the regulatory process for the $31 billion deal. The world’s biggest entertainment company shocked the market on Tuesday when it said it had approached Sky about a deal, challenging Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty First Century Fox (FOXA.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) which had already hatched a complex plan to take control of the pay-TV group. The Commission website shows no formal request has been made yet but a spokesman for Comcast said it had made an informal notification to get the ball rolling. Comcast, the owner of NBC, CNBC and MSNBC, said it went public with its approach because it wanted to start the regulatory review. It believes it only has a narrow window to get the deal done before Fox nears completion of its own takeover of the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own.  Comcast’s action complicates a separate move by Disney to buy a range of Fox assets for $52 billion, including Sky, which was based on the assumption that Fox would complete its purchase. Disney’s Bob Iger was in Paris when the news broke. He was quoted in Le Figaro newspaper as saying he had not yet studied Comcast’s provisional offer in detail. “It does not compromise our agreement with Fox,” he said in the newspaper report. “In this agreement, Fox would bring over the 39 percent of the capital of Sky that it already holds, and would, furthermore, make an offer for the rest of Sky’s capital.” Fox has said it remains committed to its cash offer announced in December 2016. But investors are now hoping that Fox will make a higher offer or question whether Disney could make its own direct bid for Sky. Shares in Sky were trading at 13.40 pounds on Wednesday, above the 12.50 pounds offered by Comcast.  Fox agreed its deal to buy Sky in December 2016 but it has been forced to go through a comprehensive regulatory review after politicians raised concerns that Murdoch held too much influence in Britain.

1216,CMCSA,Hedge funds expect counter bid for Sky after Comcast offer,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two hedge funds that have criticised Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) takeover of Britain’s Sky (SKYB.L) have said Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) rival $31 billion offer for the broadcaster is likely to trigger a higher counter-bid for the company. Comcast on Tuesday offered 12.50 pounds-a-share for the pay-television operator, seeking to disrupt a deal struck in December 2016 by Rupert Murdoch’s Fox (FOXA.O) to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for 10.75 pounds-a-share.      The situation is further complicated by a $52 billion (37.26 billion pounds) deal agreed in December 2017 by Walt Disney Co to buy Fox assets, including its 39 percent Sky stake. Disney has previously said it expects the sale of Sky to Fox to complete before it acquires the Fox assets, meaning it would assume full ownership of the British company. Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who has long argued that Fox’s takeover proposal is too cheap, told Reuters the bid from Comcast, the biggest U.S. cable operator, was “fantastic” and that a counter offer was now likely.Disney could bid directly for the British pay-TV company instead of Fox, which has faced regulatory obstacles to its Sky offer, said Odey, who is a former son-in-law of Murdoch.”Once you’re in a bidding war, it’s not about fair value, it’s about what do you think it’s worth,” Odey added. His firm owns almost 1 percent of Sky, according to Thomson Reuters data.     Hedge fund Polygon, which has also previously argued that Fox’s offer undervalues Sky, said the British company could now be sold for more than 15 pounds-a-share.”Both Comcast and Disney have strong strategic reasons for owning Sky and we would hope that will result in an even better outcome for shareholders,” Polygon portfolio manager Bechara Nasr said in a statement to Reuters.Polygon said in December that it held a small Sky stake. A spokesman for the hedge fund declined to comment on the current size of its investment.Sky shares were up 20.4 percent at 13.30 pounds at 1203 GMT on Tuesday, indicating that investors are speculating the broadcaster will fetch a higher price than Comcast has offered.

1219,CMCSA,Comcast's bid for Sky could lure Disney in bidding war,"(Reuters) - U.S. cable company Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) proposal to buy Sky Plc (SKYB.L) for $31 billion has raised the specter of a potential bidding war between with Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty First Century Fox (FOXA.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).  Comcast, the owner of NBC, MSNBC and Universal Pictures, said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain’s Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Fox has agreed to pay for it. Murdoch’s Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent stake of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain. In December, Disney agreed to buy a number of Fox assets, including Fox’s stake in Sky, in a separate $52-billion deal. The next likely step is Comcast makes a firm offer, which would require the company to have its funding in place. Fox then could return with a higher offer.  Here are some of the scenarios on what may lie in store next for Sky: The most likely scenario, according to many analysts, is that Fox, with Disney’s blessing, raises its bid, potentially prompting a bidding war with Comcast. Fox has to at least match Comcast’s bid, but analysts estimate a final winning bid for Sky could go as high as 14 to 15 pounds per share. Sky’s shares jumped Tuesday 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, above Comcast’s offer. Under the terms of Fox’s deal with Disney, Disney cannot bid for Sky on it own, so any bid would come from Fox. However, Disney CEO Bob Iger has spoken about the importance of Sky to Disney’s plan to launch a global online streaming service. So it is likely that Disney would back Fox in bidding higher. Fox could choose not to challenge Comcast, which has said its offer is contingent on acquiring more than 50 percent of Sky. Comcast would prefer to own the whole of Sky, so Fox could use its 39 percent stake in the company as a bargaining chip. Once the its deal with Fox closes, Disney will own a majority stake in online streaming service Hulu in which Comcast is also a shareholder. Some investors have speculated that Disney could swap its controlling stake in Hulu as part of a deal for Comcast’s stake in Sky.  Comcast is currently bound as a passive investor of Hulu, meaning it cannot buy more shares in the company, under its consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice when it bought NBCUniversal. However, that consent decree expires in September.      There is an outside chance that Comcast could engage with Fox about buying the assets Disney is buying. Comcast had bid $60 billion before losing out to Disney, and sources have told Reuters that Comcast has been discussing bidding for the Fox assets again.  But such a deal would face significant regulatory hurdles in the U.S., which previously prompted Fox to snub Comcast’s bid. There is no reason to believe that Fox’s assessment of the regulatory risk will change.

1222,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-RTL targets local viewers in response to global streaming platforms,"* Rolling out video on demand in European markets * Global platforms spur ‘total video’ transformation - CEO * Ramping up output of scripted programming * RTL sees 2018 revenues up 2.5-5 pct, core profits flat (New throughout with CEO interview, details) By Douglas Busvine FRANKFURT, March 7 (Reuters) - Broadcaster RTL Group will speed up a push into exclusive programming, offering locally focused video-on-demand services in its European markets in response to platforms like Netflix and Amazon. RTL, controlled by German publisher Bertelsmann, has weathered weak TV advertising demand better than rivals but is nonetheless accelerating a ‘total video’ strategy that seeks to address changing viewing habits. “We are seeing the challenging TV markets in a macroeconomic development which is very prosperous – this is a very clear signal to us to accelerate our strategic execution,” CEO Bert Habets told Reuters in an interview. RTL earlier reported solid 2017 results, with revenues up 2.2 percent to 6.37 billion euros ($7.92 billion). Earnings before interest, taxation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 3.8 percent to 1.46 billion euros, broadly in line with forecasts. RTL, whose core markets are Germany, France and the Benelux countries, forecast revenue growth of between 2.5 percent and 5 percent this year. Core earnings would remain broadly unchanged, adjusting for a one-off gain from property sales last year. RTL shares were 2 percent lower, amid broadly weaker sentiment towards the media sector after U.S. consumer products giant Procter & Gamble said it would cut spending on ad agencies. The rise of the global platforms, and U.S. entertainment group Comcast’s bid for Britain’s Sky, threaten to marginalise European broadcasters that still rely on advertising for the bulk of their revenues. But, rather than take a leaf out of their book, RTL wants to focus on national audiences by offering more original programming, including via subscription services delivered as and when viewers want to watch. It plans new video-on-demand services in Belgium, Hungary and Croatia, all based on its existing French 6play platform. “We are very confident to continue developing and investing in these on-demand services in all countries where we have a strong family of channels,” said Habets, who recently became sole CEO at RTL. RTL has a strong background in game-show formats, but has backed production arm Fremantle Media’s move into producing scripted television dramas. That has attracted the interest of the mega-platforms: Amazon recently commissioned Deutschland 86, the follow-up to an espionage serial that first aired on RTL in Germany. There’s still mileage in the ad-driven TV model, said Habets, pointing to the outperformance of RTL’s core franchises in Germany and France last year. Of total revenues, advertising still accounts for 47.5 percent, less that its main competitors. The company wants to increase the share of digital revenues as a percentage of the total to 15 percent by 2020 from 13 percent last year. “The power of linear TV will continue to be very strong, especially in the European markets, where fragmentation is ongoing, but less severe than in other continents of the world,” said Habets. RTL said it would propose a final dividend of 3 euros per share, on top of an interim dividend of 1 euro paid last September, representing a dividend yield of 5.9 percent to its shareholders.

1223,CMCSA,U.S. appeals court in San Francisco will hear net neutrality appeal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judicial panel said on Thursday that challenges to the Federal Communications Commission’s repeal of the Obama era open internet rules will be heard by an appeals court based in San Francisco.   The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict litigation said it randomly selected the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court Nth circuit to hear the consolidated challenges. The FCC declined to comment on the decision.  A dozen challenges have been filed by 22 state attorneys general, public interest groups, internet companies, a California county and the state’s Public Utilities Commission seeking to block the Trump administration’s repeal of landmark rules designed to ensure a free and open internet from taking effect. The suits were filed in both the Ninth Circuit and District of Columbia appeals court.  Of the Ninth Circuit court’s 24 active judges, 18 were appointed by Democratic presidents and six by Republican President George W. Bush. There are six current vacancies and President Donald Trump has nominated two candidates. The FCC published its order overturning the net neutrality rules in the Federal Register on Feb. 22, a procedural step that allowed for the filing of legal challenges. The Republican-led FCC in December voted 3-2 to overturn 2015 rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content on the internet. Trump in January criticized opponents for filing cases in the Ninth Circuit and asserted in a tweet they “almost always” win before being reversed.  New York, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are among the states challenging the decision, arguing the FCC cannot make “arbitrary and capricious” changes to existing policies and that it misinterpreted and disregarded “critical record evidence on industry practices and harm to consumers and businesses.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has said he is confident the order will be upheld. The White House Office of Management and Budget still must sign off on some aspects of the FCC reversal before it takes legal effect. That could take months. The repeal of the net neutrality rules was a victory for internet service providers like AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, conferring power over what content consumers can access. On the other side, technology companies including Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc have thrown their weight behind a congressional bid to reverse the net neutrality repeal.

1224,CMCSA,Comcast and Murdoch's Fox in regulatory race for Sky approval,"LONDON (Reuters) - Comcast’s (CMCSA.O) gatecrashing of Rupert Murdoch’s eight-year campaign to buy pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L) has sparked a regulatory race with 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O). Fifteen months after finally agreeing a takeover of Sky, Murdoch had been edging towards approval by offering remedies to overcome long-held concerns that he holds too much media sway in Britain, where he owns the Sun and Times newspapers. But Comcast, the owner of NBC and Universal, has made investors a higher offer with no political baggage for a business that Murdoch helped to launch and owns 39 percent of.   Fox has called on regulators to submit Comcast to the same lengthy scrutiny it received, but competition lawyers say it could gain clearance in a relatively fast probe.  Comcast offered 12.50 pounds per share, or 22.1 billion pounds ($31 billion). It has not yet made a firm bid and is sounding out investors through its brokers, BAML, sources say.  It wants to own all of Sky but will accept taking control with 50 percent plus one share if Fox decides not to sell its 39 percent stake. Fox has a separate deal to sell assets to Walt Disney (DIS.N), including Sky. Murdoch agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in December 2016 for 10.75 pounds per share, valuing the entire business at 18.5 billion pounds.  This followed a failed attempt to buy Sky in 2010, which collapsed when journalists at one of Murdoch’s papers admitted hacking into phones to secure news, sparking a criminal trial, a public inquiry and questions over his role.   One person familiar with the matter said Comcast was asking hedge fund managers how much Sky stock they controlled, indicating a belief that Fox will hold on to its stake and setting the stage for a lengthy battle.   UBS said the price could go as high as 1500 pence, driven by the fact Sky has continued to develop its technology since Fox’s bid and last month secured the rights to show Premier League matches for a lower fee than expected, boosting future earnings.  Comcast will need 82 percent acceptance from independent Sky shareholders while Fox is targeting 75 percent, meaning 15 percent of independent investors could block the deal.  Comcast is providing information to the European Commission and believes it can get approval in the so-called Phase 1 of the investigation, avoiding a prolonged process. It could take several weeks before Comcast files a formal notification.  Brussels will examine whether a Comcast-owned Sky could be anti-competitive when dealing with rival channels on its platform and whether there is a threat from putting Sky in the same company as film studio Universal.      The regulator could also consider if Sky would be owned by companies holding three of the six major film studios if Comcast owns 61 percent and Walt Disney retains Murdoch’s 39 percent.  Comcast would argue that were Fox or Disney to retain 39 percent, they would be a financial investor with no commercial or operational link with Sky.  In terms of previous conduct, Comcast was accused by U.S. regulators in 2012 of breaching a condition imposed when it bought NBC Universal, by discriminating against rivals in favor of its own channels when placing them on the program guide. Comcast says it appealed the decision and the two sides settled in 2014. It also agreed to pay $2.3 million to resolve a federal investigation into allegations it wrongfully charged customers for services they never authorized.  In Britain, Comcast has been involved in some minor breaches of broadcasting rules for airing offensive language, breaking impartiality and advertising rules, and it was sanctioned and fined in 2012 for broadcasting soft porn during the day on a channel that could be watched by children. Fox has called on regulators to examine all these issues. But Howard Cartlidge, head of EU and Competition law at DWF, said a larger pattern of offences would need to be proved to force a longer EU investigation: “I don’t see there being significant regulatory hurdles.” Lawyers do not expect the UK government to launch a public interest test either as Comcast does not own newspapers - the issue that has caused so many delays for Fox.  The EU cleared Fox’s 2016 bid in a Phase 1 investigation on competition grounds, however British politicians, wary of appearing close to the Murdoch family, have bounced the deal to local regulators on the issue of media plurality and standards.  UK regulators accepted Fox would uphold broadcasting standards, saying that sexual harassment allegations at the Fox News network in the U.S. did not call into question its commitment to standards in Britain.      On media plurality, the Competition and Markets Authority said in January the deal should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent the Murdochs from influencing the network’s news operations.  Fox has since pledged to keep Sky News independent and fully funded for 10 years. Lawyers and analysts said that should be enough to secure regulatory approval.  Fox sees the fact it has almost received regulatory approval as a competitive advantage over Comcast. It is pursuing the Sky takeover because it is part of its larger deal with Disney. “With Disney now being the ultimate buyer for Sky rather than Fox, we think political opposition to the deal may be easing,” UBS said. After notification, Brussels has 25 working days to analyze Comcast’s deal during Phase 1. Any offer of remedies could add 10 working days. For Fox, the UK regulator will give its final report to government by May 1 and a final decision will come by mid-June.

The EU cleared Fox’s 2016 bid in a Phase 1 investigation, however British politicians, wary of appearing close to the Murdoch family, have bounced the deal to local regulators. UK regulators accepted Fox would uphold broadcasting standards, saying that sexual harassment allegations at the Fox News network in the U.S. did not call into question its commitment to standards in Britain. But media plurality, and whether the deal would reduce competition and give Murdoch too much influence in Britain, has proved more problematic. The Competition and Markets Authority said in January the deal should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent the Murdochs from influencing the network’s news operations. Fox has since pledged to keep Sky News independent and fully funded for 10 years. Lawyers and analysts said that should be enough to secure regulatory approval. Fox sees the fact it has almost received regulatory approval as a competitive advantage over Comcast. It is pursuing the Sky takeover because it is part of its larger deal with Disney. “With Disney now being the ultimate buyer for Sky rather than Fox, we think political opposition to the deal may be easing,” UBS said. After notification, Brussels has 25 working days to analyse Comcast’s deal during Phase 1. Any offer of remedies could add 10 working days. For Fox, the UK regulator will give its final report to government by May 1 and a final decision will come by mid-June.

1226,CMCSA,Disney shareholders vote against CEO Iger's pay package,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) shareholders rejected an executive compensation plan that could reward Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger with up to $48.5 million a year over four years plus an equity grant worth about $100 million, in a non-binding vote on Thursday. The total compensation is tied to the closing of Disney’s planned $52.4 billion acquisition of film and TV assets from Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) and meeting performance targets. Fifty-two percent of shareholders voted against Disney’s compensation plan for Iger and other executives, the company said at its annual shareholder meeting in Houston. Forty-four percent cast ballots in favor and 4 percent abstained. “The board accepts the result of today’s non-binding vote and will take it under advisement for future CEO compensation,” Aylwin Lewis, chair of the board’s compensation committee, said in a statement. Iger’s continuation as chief executive is imperative in light of the planned Fox acquisition, Lewis said, noting that  total shareholder return has more than quadrupled over Iger’s tenure. Iger has been CEO since 2005 and added the title of chairman in 2012. Under the compensation plan, Iger would be paid up to $48.5 million in annual salary and bonuses if the Fox deal goes through, for each of the four years from 2018 to 2021. Iger was also awarded an equity grant that could be worth about $100 million in 2021, according to proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services, which urged investors to vote against the pay resolution. Seventy-five percent of the grant is based on Disney’s total shareholder returns compared with the S&P; 500 Index. Iger’s compensation reached $36.3 million in fiscal 2017. His contract was extended through 2021 when Disney announced the Fox deal in December. It is unusual for shareholders to vote against executive compensation. Just 1.2 percent of S&P; 500 companies failed to win majority support for their advisory pay resolutions in 2017, according to ISS Analytics.  ISS said the “substantial” payments to Iger tied to the Fox merger were “concerning.”  “While we acknowledge the need to retain critical leadership in anticipation of such a significant merger, the magnitude of the special equity grant ($100 million) is excessive,” ISS said in a January report. Lewis said the board had decided it was “imperative” for Iger to remain to oversee the integration of Fox businesses and that Fox also felt his continued leadership was “essential.” Total shareholder return has jumped 414 percent during Iger’s tenure, and Disney’s market capitalization has climbed to $156 billion from $46 billion, Lewis added. “We believe that the terms of Bob’s extension are in the best interests of our company and our shareholders, and essential to Disney’s ability to effectively maximize long-term value from this extraordinary acquisition,” Lewis said. The Fox acquisition is undergoing regulatory review that could take at least a year and has been complicated by Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) bid for one of the assets, Britain’s Sky PLC (SKYB.L). At the shareholder meeting, Iger said the deal would create “an extraordinary global entertainment company with a content and the platforms and the reach to meet the growing demands of consumers around the world.”  One shareholder asked Iger about his plans for Fox Searchlight, the arthouse film division that on Sunday won the Academy Award for best picture for “The Shape of Water.” “We have every intention, once the acquisition is approved, to maintain the business of Fox Searchlight,” Iger said.

1228,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-Disney creates streaming video unit for digital future,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said on Wednesday it had created a new unit for its streaming video and international businesses as the company retools its traditional media operation for a world rapidly embracing online video. Kevin Mayer, the company’s chief strategy officer, was named chairman of the new division, which will oversee the upcoming ESPN+ digital offering and the launch of a family-oriented streaming service in late 2019, Disney said in a statement.  The move, effective immediately, comes as Disney is in the process of purchasing film, TV and international businesses from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O). Regulators are reviewing the deal, which has been complicated by Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) offer for one of the assets, Britain’s Sky Plc (SKYB.L). Disney also combined its theme parks business with the consumer products unit that licenses characters for toys, apparel and other merchandise. Bob Chapek, who heads the parks division, will lead the combined unit. Media networks and the movie studio will remain separate units, Disney said. “We are strategically positioning our businesses for the future, creating a more effective, global framework to serve consumers worldwide, increase growth, and maximize shareholder value,” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement. Disney’s largest TV network, ESPN, has been losing subscribers as customers drop pay television subscriptions in favor of streaming services such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O).  The company is responding with its own digital push. It is pulling its first-run movies from Netflix in 2019 to offer them on the Disney-branded service. If the Fox deal wins approval, Disney also will expand its programming portfolio and international reach, plus own a majority stake in the Hulu streaming service.  Disney expects to switch its financial reporting to reflect the new structure by the beginning of fiscal 2019, the company said.  Shares of Disney rose 0.5 percent to $104.33 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

1229,CMCSA,UPDATE 1-Britain shrugs off Brexit to enjoy boom in dealmaking,"LONDON (Reuters) - British companies have been swept up in a global boom in dealmaking that has seen the amount of M&A; involving UK firms hit its highest level since 2007. Britain’s M&A; market has remained buoyant despite the country’s looming exit from the European Union a year from now, a prospect which has cast uncertainty over British companies’ access to the single market. Rather than deter businesses from striking deals, however, it has prompted them to prepare for Brexit by acquiring rivals to build scale. The availability of cheap debt, high equity valuations that are allowing companies to use their stock to pay for acquisitions, and economic growth are all behind the surge in M&A;, bankers said. The value of M&A; volumes involving British businesses rose by 56.5 percent to $164.3 billion during the first quarter, the most since the $166.3 billion recorded in the same period 11 years ago, Thomson Reuters data show.  Including plans by Anglo-Dutch Unilever and RELX to abandon their dual listing structures, total deal levels hit $280.8 billion in the first three months of 2018 in the UK, according to the data. It means that Britain remained the second biggest country for deals behind the United States. Globally, dealmaking surged 67 percent to almost $1.2 trillion, the data show.  In Britain this week alone,  U.S. exchange operator CME Group (CME.O) agreed to buy British financial technology firm NEX (NXGN.L) for about 3.9 billion pounds ($5.5 billion) and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.T) said it was considering an approach for FTSE 100 drugmaker Shire (SHP.L), which has a market value of about 32 billion pounds.  “This feels like it’s going to be a big year for M&A;,” said Alison Harding-Jones, the head of European, Middle East and Africa M&A; at Citigroup. “This is not just UK based and is driven by a perfect storm of all the ingredients you need for deals.” British companies are bulking up in preparation for the post-Brexit era. Dwayne Lysaght, the head of UK M&A; at JP Morgan Cazenove, said there is “a bit of a Brexit squeeze which is encouraging a focus on domestic consolidation.”   “British companies are acknowledging the need to be bigger to compete in a more open, global market place,” he added. Domestic deals totaled $43.3 billion in value during the first quarter, up from $24.9 billion a year earlier, the Thomson Reuters data show.  They include events and exhibitions business Informa’s (INF.L) 3.9 billion-pound deal to acquire rival UBM (UBM.L) and the sale of Standard Life Aberdeen’s (SLA.L) insurance business to Phoenix (PHNX.L) for 3.2 billion pounds. The biggest is Melrose Industries (MRON.L) 8 billion-pound takeover of aerospace and automotive parts supplier GKN (GKN.L), which was Britain’s largest hostile bid since Kraft swooped on Cadbury in 2009. Melrose clinched the deal on Thursday after 52.4 percent of GKN investors accepted its cash-and-shares offer. Stripping out Unilever and RELX, outbound M&A; volumes were$27.2 billion, down from $42.3 billion in 2017, while inbound deals rose to $77.9 billion pounds, from $17.5 billion a year earlier, according to the data.  The biggest bid by an overseas acquirer for a British group  was Comcast’s (CMCSA.O) potential 22.1 billion-pound proposal for Sky (SKYB.L), an attempt by the U.S. giant to gatecrash the takeover the broadcaster agreed with its 39 percent shareholder Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) late in 2016.  Both Fox’s pending bid for Sky and Melrose’s acquisition of GKN have drawn considerable scrutiny from British lawmakers. The former has raised concerns about Rupert Murdoch’s influence over the UK media landscape, while the latter has sparked fears Melrose will break up GKN, a mainstay of Britain’s engineering sector, once it has turned the company around. Indeed, under Theresa May, who became prime minister in July 2016, the British government has adopted a more interventionist stance toward M&A; by foreign companies.  In October, it proposed new rules that would give lawmakers more say over takeovers of firms involved in the more sensitive technology and defense sectors. Even so, that stance has not deterred overseas businesses from attempting to buy British firms, said Dominic Morris, the head of UK M&A; at law firm Allen & Overy. “Yes, you could argue the government’s being more activist to some degree and people have to be mindful of that,” he said. “But do I think it’s right up there at the top of (acquirer’s) agenda? I’m not sure it is.” More worrying for the M&A; bankers and lawyers would be if the current boom in deals proved to be the top of the cycle, as it was 11 years ago, and activity begins to falter. “It feels very similar to 2007,” said Morris. “I would say if we’re not at the top of the market, we must be pretty close to it.” ",3292018,http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-ma/update-1-britain-shrugs-off-brexit-to-enjoy-boom-in-dealmaking-idUSL8N1RB5XX

1232,CMCSA,Economist tells U.S. judge AT&T-Time; Warner deal would harm consumers,"WASHINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department called an economist on Wednesday to testify that allowing AT&T; to purchase movie and TV production company Time Warner would cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, as the government wrapped up its efforts to convince a judge to stop the proposed deal. Carl Shapiro, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said the planned $85.4 billion merger would give AT&T;, which owns DirecTV, leverage to charge more for Time Warner’s Turner family of channels, which includes sports and CNN. It would also give AT&T; the opportunity to coordinate with Comcast Corp, which owns NBCU, to starve cheaper online video companies of content, he said. Shapiro is expected to be the government’s last witness as it seeks to show that the proposed merger is illegal under antitrust law because it would harm consumers. The government filed a lawsuit in November and is asking Judge Richard Leon to block the deal. Following Shapiro, who will likely face cross examination Wednesday afternoon, AT&T;’s lawyers are expected to bring their own economist, Dennis Carlton of the University of Chicago. Shapiro testified that AT&T;’s ownership of DirecTV means that it will likely raise rates for content when it negotiates contracts with other cable and satellite companies, and will be more willing to let contracts lapse so DirecTV could win over irritated subscribers when the rival “goes dark.” Blackouts mattered, he said. “Even though they don’t happen very much, that’s the key to leverage,” he said. Shapiro noted that companies tend to function as one entity, rather than parts. “That (NBCU’s strategy) would not be in the combined interest of the company. They would be leaving money on the table,” he said. The trial, which began in mid-March in the U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month. AT&T; has denied that the merger will hike costs and questioned the government expert’s model. The company has said it believes the deal would actually lead to a price decrease in prices for pay TV subscribers.

1233,CMCSA,Breakingviews - Busting EU sport cartel lines already fat pockets,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - European antitrust investigators may have found a rare example of a cartel that helps consumers. Groups including Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox were raided on Tuesday in a probe into the distribution of media rights for sports broadcasting. If collusion held down inflated rights prices, the main beneficiaries from its end would be already-loaded teams and athletes. A European Commission statement – released late on Tuesday after the Telegraph newspaper reported the raid on one of Fox’s London offices – gives scant detail about the investigation. It is looking into companies in several European states “active in the distribution of media rights” for sports broadcasts, which it suspects of violating European Union rules prohibiting cartels and restrictive business practices. The FT reported on Wednesday that Ziggo Sport, owned by a Vodafone and Liberty Global joint venture that competes with Fox in the Netherlands, is also included in the probe. The attention is a bad look for Fox, whose 11.7 billion pound bid for the 61 percent of Sky it doesn’t already own is under intense regulatory scrutiny. But the investigation is likely to take too long to have much of an impact on the review, which is anyway focused on Murdoch’s control over UK news. Shareholders in the British broadcaster would still probably take Murdoch’s money if he beat a possible bid from rival cable group Comcast. The commission’s probe instead raises questions about who the beneficiaries of a sports-rights cartel would be. In sports like soccer and tennis, tournament administrators aim to maximise the value of broadcast rights, sometimes using blind auctions to increase their income and therefore the amount of prize money they can offer teams and athletes. If the commission is probing broadcasters like Fox, which buy the rights, then the effect of any anticompetitive practices would presumably be to reduce the price paid to sports leagues and tournament owners. Since those payments are ultimately shouldered by customers of the pay-TV groups, higher broadcast-rights prices would arguably be bad for consumers. The commission’s focus may lie elsewhere – in the murky chain of specialist companies handling and distributing media rights for sports. But if the intention of the probe is to boost competitive tensions among bidders, it may have stumbled upon a cartel featuring few victims with which to sympathise.",4112018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-britain-breakingviews/breakingviews-busting-eu-sport-cartel-lines-already-fat-pockets-idUSKBN1HI1QT

1237,CMCSA,AT&T; economist argues Time Warner merger is good for consumers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T;’s (T.N) proposed merger with Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) would save consumers money because the marriage of a pay-TV provider with a movie and TV giant would create a more efficient company, an economist testifying for AT&T; said in court on Thursday Dennis Carlton, from the University of Chicago, sought to rebut testimony on Wednesday from an economist for the government, Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley, who said the $84.5 billion deal would cost American consumers some $286 annually in higher prices.  The government filed a lawsuit in November to block the deal, citing antitrust concerns. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon will order the deal stopped if he determines it would raise prices for pay TV consumers or threaten the development of online video. Shapiro had argued that the proposed deal would spur AT&T;, which owns DirecTV, to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content, in particular the Turner family of news and sports shows.  He also said the combined company would have an incentive to decline to offer content to cheaper online video services. Carlton attacked the assumptions in Shapiro’s testimony and used newer data to show that by his tally, the deal would provide a net benefit to consumers of 52 cents per pay TV subscriber a month. “There is an efficiency from vertical integration,” argued Carlton. The proposed transaction is considered a vertical deal since AT&T;, which owns satellite television company DirecTV, is buying a content supplier, Time Warner. Carlton said Shapiro underestimated how many people were dropping pay TV altogether and overestimated how many people would leave their pay TV provider if they lost access to Turner’s channels. On cross-examination, government attorney Craig Conrath sought unsuccessfully to push Carlton to concede that a previous vertical deal, Comcast’s purchase of NBCU, led to more expensive TV shows and movies when NBCU negotiated new contracts with other pay TV companies. The trial, which began in mid-March in U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month.

1238,CMCSA,AT&T; economist argues Time Warner merger is good for consumers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T;’s (T.N) proposed merger with Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) would save consumers money because the marriage of a pay-TV provider with a movie and TV giant would create a more efficient company, an economist testifying for AT&T; said in court on Thursday Dennis Carlton, from the University of Chicago, sought to rebut testimony on Wednesday from an economist for the government, Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley, who said the $84.5 billion deal would cost American consumers some $286 annually in higher prices.  The government filed a lawsuit in November to block the deal, citing antitrust concerns. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon will order the deal stopped if he determines it would raise prices for pay TV consumers or threaten the development of online video. Shapiro had argued that the proposed deal would spur AT&T;, which owns DirecTV, to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content, in particular the Turner family of news and sports shows.  He also said the combined company would have an incentive to decline to offer content to cheaper online video services. Carlton attacked the assumptions in Shapiro’s testimony and used newer data to show that by his tally, the deal would provide a net benefit to consumers of 52 cents per pay TV subscriber a month. “There is an efficiency from vertical integration,” argued Carlton. The proposed transaction is considered a vertical deal since AT&T;, which owns satellite television company DirecTV, is buying a content supplier, Time Warner. Carlton said Shapiro underestimated how many people were dropping pay TV altogether and overestimated how many people would leave their pay TV provider if they lost access to Turner’s channels. On cross-examination, government attorney Craig Conrath sought unsuccessfully to push Carlton to concede that a previous vertical deal, Comcast’s purchase of NBCU, led to more expensive TV shows and movies when NBCU negotiated new contracts with other pay TV companies. The trial, which began in mid-March in U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month. In a sign of the high stakes of the trial, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, sat at the government counsel’s table on Thursday, prompting a reaction from Leon, who said: “My goodness gracious,” when Delrahim introduced himself.

1239,CMCSA,"UPDATE 1-Fox chose Disney over Comcast on regulatory, stock fears -filing","(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), which agreed in December to sell most of its assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) for $52.4 billion, had previously rejected a bid from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) over concerns about the regulatory risks and its stock value, a regulatory filing on Wednesday showed. The joint filing by Disney and Fox, which outlines the timeline of their negotiations, offers the most detailed insight yet into Fox’s thinking, as it goes head-to-head against Comcast, a U.S. cable operator, in its bid to acquire European pay-TV company Sky Plc (SKYB.L), in which Fox holds a 39 percent stake. Comcast announced in February it was working on a $31 billion bid that would top Fox’s deal for Sky. It has not made a new attempt to bid for the Fox assets after the Disney deal, so investors are keen for information on the hurdles that prevented an agreement between Fox and Comcast. The filing does not mention Comcast by name, but refers to it as Party B. Another bidder for the Fox assets, U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), is referred to as Party A. Verizon and Comcast representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Comcast on Nov. 14 offered to acquire most of Fox’s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, the filings said. Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox’s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the documents show.  In the filing, Disney and Fox said the ongoing antitrust scrutiny of U.S. telecommunications provider AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) planned merger with media conglomerate Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) heightened concerns about potential regulatory hurdles to Comcast’s bid. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued AT&T; and Time Warner to thwart their deal, and the case is in court. The companies added that, unlike Disney, Comcast declined to offer a reverse deal termination fee, which would compensate Fox in the event that regulators stymied a deal. Disney offered a reverse termination fee of $2.5 billion.  The companies also said that Fox saw Disney’s stock as more valuable than Comcast’s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure. Comcast’s proposal, on the other hand, would reduce the compensation offered to Fox shareholders in the event that asset sales were required to reassure antitrust regulators, increasing the potential risk to Fox shareholders, the filing said.  Verizon’s bid was rejected because it offered to acquire Fox at market value, without a meaningful premium, according to the filing.

1241,CMCSA,Sky reports strong quarter before bid battle steps up,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sky (SKYB.L), the pay-TV group at the center of a takeover battle between Fox, Disney and Comcast, reported a strong third quarter on Thursday, underlining its appeal to rival U.S. entertainment groups who want to expand in Europe. Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said the British company was “well placed for the future” regardless of which company emerged as its ultimate owner.   Sky added 38,000 customers, taking its customer base to nearly 23 million homes.  Core earnings for the nine months to end-March were up 10 percent to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) on like-for-like revenue up 5 percent to 10.1 billion pounds. The latest battle to buy Sky started in December 2016, when Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O), the owner of 39 percent of the company, agreed to buy the rest. Since then, the deal has been stuck in regulatory purgatory,  a tortuous process due to end in June. But if Fox receives clearance it is unlikely to end up as the long-term owner of Sky. Murdoch agreed to sell most of Fox to Disney (DIS.N) for $52.4 billion in December, including its stake in Sky.  Fox spurned a higher offer from U.S. cable giant Comcast (CMCSA.O) over concerns about regulatory risk and its stock value, a filing showed on Wednesday. After losing that battle, Comcast said it was considering making a 12.50 pounds a share offer for Sky, valuing the group at $31 billion, and trumping the 10.75 pounds offer agreed by Fox.  Darroch said on Thursday there had been some interaction between Sky and Comcast in terms of the regulatory process.  “They haven’t yet come forward with a full offer, as and when they do that, if they do, then we will obviously come back and talk a bit more in detail then,” he told reporters. Fox/Disney and Comcast want to buy Sky to scale up against online groups Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Darroch said Sky was continuing to improve its own products and services to ensure it provided the content entertainment its customers wanted. It will launch streaming service Spotify (SPOT.N) on its flagship Sky Q platform next week, and will offer Netflix (NFLX.O) in a Sky package in Britain before the end of the year, he said. “Customers can look forward to an even broader choice of entertainment through our pioneering new partnerships with Netflix and Spotify, together with our new Premier League deal which secures the UK rights until 2022,” he said. Sky shares were trading at 13.05 pounds at 1036 GMT, down 0.3 percent. ",4192018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-results/sky-reports-strong-quarter-before-bid-battle-steps-up-idUSKBN1HQ0NQ

1249,CMCSA,Breakingviews - Comcast is best leaving Fox to the Mouse,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast boss Brian Roberts already made a bid for parts of Twenty-First Century Fox, and failed. Now he has left the door ajar for another lurch. It would be better to walk away. Roberts seems to be in the mood for mergers. He confirmed on Wednesday morning a $31 billion offer for European pay-TV company Sky. That’s 16 percent higher than an offer already made by Fox, which is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it doesn’t already own in order to then sell the whole thing to Walt Disney. Second, Roberts promised during an earnings call not to use the company’s sagging shares as an acquisition currency – but pointed to the strength of Comcast’s balance sheet, in a strong signal that he is open to further deals funded by cash. Pledging not to use stock for deals is fair enough. Shareholders often don’t like dilution. But the risk is that Roberts might be tempted to reprise his bid for some other bits of Fox, which Disney has agreed to buy for $66.1 billion including debt. Comcast tried that once before, but was knocked back by Fox’s chairman and presiding shareholder, Rupert Murdoch. Here’s why Roberts ought to refrain. The Fox assets might make $3.8 billion in operating profit in 2018, taking Bernstein EBITDA divisional estimates and assuming operating profit is split among the Fox businesses in the same proportions. Assume Comcast can drive out $1.5 billion of savings, less than Disney’s estimate of $2 billion, and the total hits $5.3 billion. Tax that, and for a deal valued at $66 billion, Comcast’s return on investment would be about 6 percent. And that’s even if Comcast matches, rather than tries to best, Disney’s offer. True, Roberts would be saving Disney from itself. The Magic Kingdom’s return on investment, even with higher cost savings, is still below 8 percent. But that’s no consolation to Comcast shareholders, who would be left with a value-destroying deal. Fox originally swatted away Comcast’s offer because of regulatory risk, and it’s unlikely Murdoch would have wanted to hold shares in a company Roberts controls. Comcast should thank him – because trying again, even in cash, would simply be a bad idea.",4252018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-fox-breakingviews/breakingviews-comcast-is-best-leaving-fox-to-the-mouse-idUSKBN1HW2RR

Shares of the world’s biggest planemaker rose 2.5 percent after its profit jumped by more than half in the first quarter and the company raised its full-year forecasts for cash flow and earnings. After Caterpillar spooked investors by warning about higher material costs on Tuesday, Boeing executives, on a post-earnings call noted that it was not seeing a material effect from raw material costs. “With earnings reports that are coming out, the focus is on the forward guidance for where the interest rate environment is going,” said William Norris, chief investment officer at CIBC Bank USA. “Investors are seeing a lot more cross-currents impacting the markets ... we knew that earnings were going to be very good and people are looking beyond the first quarter.” The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, the benchmark for global interest rates, held above 3 percent after crossing the level for the first time in four years on Tuesday, stoking concerns about higher borrowing rates for companies. Comcast rose 3.7 percent after the U.S. cable company topped Wall Street’s profit estimates and offered $30.7 billion in a bid for Sky. Twitter, initially up 10 percent after a strong set of quarterly results, flipped to a 5 percent fall on the day. Facebook which is set to report after market on Wednesday, was down 0.14 percent. Investors will watch for any update on the social network’s plan on data protection after it became embroiled in a huge scandal surrounding the misuse of its users’ data by a consultancy. “There’s pending regulation, we don’t know how exactly it’s going to play out and there’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Reuters data shows that analysts are now estimating 22 percent profit growth in the first quarter among the S&P; 500 companies, compared with 18.6 percent at the start of the earnings season. At 13:08 ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.18 points, or 0.11 percent, at 23,996.95, the S&P; 500 was down 0.91 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,633.65 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.34 points at 7,007.01. Financial stocks were the biggest laggards, falling 0.4 percent on the S&P; 500, after a 5 percent drop in shares of Capital One as the credit card issuer reported a drop in net interest margin. General Electric fell more than 4 percent after Moody’s changed its ratings outlook on the company. The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of short-term stock market volatility, jumped to a more than 1-week high of 18.72 points.

Sky’s independent directors welcomed Comcast’s 12.50 pound per share bid and said they would now engage with both Comcast and Fox.

It said on Wednesday it remained committed to its offer and was considering its options.  The Fox-Sky deal has been held up by concerns about the influence Murdoch could wield over public opinion through owning all of the broadcaster as well as British newspapers including The Times and The Sun. The proposed combination has been further complicated by Fox’s agreement to sell many of its TV and film assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), including its stake in Sky, for $52 billion. Disney did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  On Wednesday, Sky also welcomed commitments the U.S. cable giant had made to address potential public-interest concerns over Sky News, its influential 24-hour news channel. PJT Partners is advising Sky alongside Barclays and Morgan Stanley. Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Roberts said Sky withdrawing its recommendation was what it wanted to achieve by formalizing its offer on Wednesday. “The board confirming they are going to focus on the shareholders, that’s the perfect step as far as we are concerned today,” he told reporters. Sky is chaired by Murdoch’s son James, who played a key role in building the company into a major European broadcaster with operations in Germany, Austria and Italy as well as Britain. Sky formed a committee of independent directors to consider the bids, given James Murdoch’s role as chief executive of Fox. The most likely scenario, according to many analysts, is that Fox, with Disney’s blessing, raises its bid. Fox has to at least match Comcast’s offer, but analysts estimate a final winning bid could go as high as 14 to 15 pounds per share.  Sky’s shares rose 3.9 percent on Tuesday, closing at 13.59 pounds, above Comcast’s offer, implying that some shareholders anticipated a bidding war. Comcast shares, which had fallen 14 percent since February, were 3.5 percent higher, while Fox’s rose 2 percent and Disney gained 1.6 percent. “We think (Comcast) could reasonably take the offer up to 1300p, but they would be giving away value at anything above that,” New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin said. Morningstar analyst Allan Nichols said Comcast’s offer fully valued Sky, and any increase would be negative for Comcast, Disney or Fox shareholders. That would likely keep a lid on a bidding war, he wrote in a research note. Hedge fund Elliott has taken a stake of almost 3 percent in Sky, according to its latest filing, and other shareholders have also argued that Disney’s agreement to buy Fox implies a higher value for Sky. Little known in Europe, Philadelphia-based Comcast is the biggest U.S. cable operator, owning broadcasters NBC, CNBC and MSNBC. It also owns movie studio Universal Pictures, home to “Minions” and “Jason Bourne” movies and some theme parks. It said it had formalized its offer to coincide with its own results, giving it an opportunity to explain to investors the merits of the bid. Its quarterly earnings topped Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. Roberts said Comcast had been built through bold investments since it was founded by his father in 1963. “When you see opportunities that won’t come around again - unique opportunities - you have to consider that with extra focus,” he said. “Sky will be our platform for growth across Europe.” He said Comcast was continuing to work with the European Commission on the regulatory process, and he did not believe a British investigation would be required. “We believe in the importance of news and the integrity that underpins it (and) we have a proven track record of stewardship and investment,” he said. Comcast said it had secured a bridge loan of up to 16 billion pounds and a term loan credit agreement of up to 7 billion pounds to fund the deal.

Its quarterly earnings topped Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. Roberts said Comcast had been built through bold investments since it was founded by his father in 1963. “When you see opportunities that won’t come around again - unique opportunities - you have to consider that with extra focus,” he said. “Sky will be our platform for growth across Europe.” He said Comcast was continuing to work with the European Commission on the regulatory process, and he did not believe a British investigation would be required. “We believe in the importance of news and the integrity that underpins it (and) we have a proven track record of stewardship and investment,” he said. Comcast said it had secured a bridge loan of up to 16 billion pounds and a term loan credit agreement of up to 7 billion pounds to fund the deal.

1253,CMCSA,Breakingviews - Sky upside depends on Disney-Fox irrationality,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Deals rarely look as good on paper as they do in a chief executive’s head. Comcast’s $31 billion offer for UK satellite broadcaster Sky just about passes financial muster. Investors expecting a higher bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox, with backing from Walt Disney boss Bob Iger, are betting on the triumph of sentiment over spreadsheet. The cable giant run by Brian Roberts on Wednesday firmed up its offer of 12.50 pounds per Sky share, beating Murdoch’s December 2016 bid by 16 percent. The move endangers the mogul’s plan to sell Fox – including Sky – to Disney for $52.4 billion in stock. It also dashes any hopes that Iger and Murdoch could persuade Roberts to back away by offering him an alternative asset, like U.S. streaming service Hulu. Assuming British regulators clear both bids, it’s a straightforward battle on price. Comcast has the stronger hand. On Wednesday the $155 billion company said it had identified $300 million of annual pre-tax cost savings and a further $200 million of gains from combining Sky’s TV shows and movies with Comcast’s NBCUniversal library. Generously add those to consensus estimates for Sky’s operating profit in 2020, tax the lot at 18 percent, and the return on invested capital is almost 7 percent. That’s just about in line with cable groups’ cost of capital, according to New York University estimates. It’s hard to see how Murdoch and Iger could justify going higher. The House of Mouse has less overlap with Sky’s core business as a distributor of video entertainment. Second, Comcast has greater firepower: its leverage is low for a cable group and its EBITDA this year will be greater than Disney and Fox combined, according to Eikon estimates. Besides, Comcast’s dual-class stock means Roberts does not have to fret about shareholders blocking his plans. Iger might conclude that Sky is crucial to his European expansion. Murdoch, meanwhile, will be reluctant to part with the company he spent decades building, and might want to hang on to Fox’s 39 percent stake in case the wider Disney tie-up collapses. Nevertheless, investors who pushed Sky shares up 4 percent to 13.57 pounds on Wednesday are wagering on Disney and Fox disregarding financial sense.",4252018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-sky-upside-depends-on-disney-fox-irrationality-idUSKBN1HW248

1255,CMCSA,Comcast backs Sky bid with 23 billion pounds of loans,"LONDON (LPC) - US cable operator Comcast Corp CMSA.O said on Wednesday that it is backing its offer for Sky Plc (SKYB.L) with £23bn (US$32.06bn) of loans. The financing was arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch as administrative agent and Wells Fargo as syndication agent, both banks acting as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. There is an up to £16bn 364-day unsecured bridge loan and an up to £7bn of unsecured term loans. The bridge loan is expected to be replaced, in whole or in part, by senior unsecured bonds in a public offering or private placement. The bridge loan pays a margin tied to ratings stepping up over time, ranging from 75bp to 200bp over Libor.  BAML committed £2.8bn of the bridge loan while Wells Fargo committed £2.08bn. Credit Suisse, Mizuho Bank, MUFG and SMBC each committed £1.44bn, while BNP Paribas, RBC and TD Bank each committed £880m. Commerzbank, DNB, Societe Generale, PNC Bank and US Bank each committed £544m.  The term loans, which are available in US dollars and sterling, comprise a £3bn three-year loan and a £4bn five-year loan. Pricing on the term loans is also tied to ratings with the three-year facility paying between 62.5bp and 112.5bp over Libor and the five-year facility paying between 75bp and 125bp over Libor. BAML committed £1.225bn to the term loans, while Wells Fargo committed £910m. Credit Suisse, Mizuho Bank, MUFG and SMBC each committed £630m, while BNP Paribas, RBC and TD Bank each committed £385m. Commerzbank, DNB, Societe Generale, PNC Bank and US Bank each committed £238m. Comcast’s £12.50 per share offer represents a premium of around 16% over a rival offer from Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O), valuing Sky at around £22bn. Sky withdrew its recommendation for Fox’s bid on Wednesday and will now engage with both Comcast and Fox over the potential takeover.

1259,CMCSA,UPDATE 2-Britain to rule on Murdoch's Sky bid by June 13,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government will give its verdict on Rupert Murdoch’s 18-month pursuit of Sky (SKYB.L) by June 13, potentially paving the way for the mogul’s Fox to take on Comcast in the battle for the British TV group.  Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) agreed a deal to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in December 2016, but the takeover has been repeatedly held up by politicians and regulators who fear it will give Murdoch too much influence in Britain.  Fox has offered commitments designed to protect the editorial independence of Sky’s News division but both sides were stunned in February when U.S. media group Comcast (CMCSA.O) made a rival offer.  Comcast has since made that a formal $31 billion bid. “My decision will be on whether the merger operates or may be expected to operate against the public interest, taking into account the specified public interest considerations of media plurality and genuine commitment to broadcasting standards,” Secretary of State for Culture and Media Matt Hancock, said in a written ministerial statement. Fox’s bid for Sky has been complicated by its more recent agreement to sell many of its TV and film assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), including its stake in Sky, for $52 billion. Fox said it had offered a range of undertakings that would fund and protect the editorial independence of Sky News. It said this underscored its “long-standing commitment to the excellence and complete editorial independence of the news service we created 28 years ago.  “These enhanced remedies go above and beyond what Ofcom, the expert independent regulator on UK broadcasting, had stated would mitigate concerns around media plurality. We now look forward to the Secretary of State’s decision.” Hancock said he would deliver his final verdict to parliament. He said however that having given his verdict, he would consider any further undertakings that may be made by Fox and offer the industry the chance to give their verdict.  The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating whether the deal will give Murdoch, who owns the Times and Sun newspapers, too much influence in Britain’s news media. It sent its assessment to Hancock on Tuesday, giving him 30 working days to assess the deal.

1261,CMCSA,T-Mobile adds to record M&A; spree,"NEW YORK (LPC) - The US$38bn financing backing the merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp is the latest high-profile M&A; financing to hit the market, adding to a pipeline of deals that lenders expect will continue to grow. Lenders have extended about US$679bn in loans backing global M&A; deals so far this year, toppling the prior record of almost US$542bn set for the same period in 2007 before the financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. These numbers promise to keep swelling, with Vodafone nearing a transformational deal to buy assets from cable giant Liberty Global. “A generally business-friendly environment in Washington, DC, a positive economic outlook and favorable tax treatment, both in terms of corporate rates and being able to access foreign reserves in a tax efficient way, appears to be giving boards the confidence they need to pull the trigger on strategic transactions, some of which have been in the works for a while,” said Jason Kyrwood, a partner at Davis Polk.  Industry-specific factors, including the so-called Amazon effect and the need for international expansion to drive growth, are also at play, he said. “Certainly there’s no shortage of financing available,” Kyrwood said. “There are more marquee deals than we’ve seen in a while, and banks are eager to participate.” Corporations clamoring for growth and diversity are striking while the iron is hot, with borrowing costs still low and investor demand for the debt backing many of these transactions still high. The US$1.7trn of global mergers and acquisitions announced this year, a record for this period, tops just over US$1trn during the same time a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence. SIX-STRONG     Six banks initially committed US$38bn of loans to back the tie-up between the third- and fourth-largest US wireless carriers. The financing comprises a US$4bn five-year revolving credit, a US$7bn seven-year senior secured term loan B, a US$19bn 364-day senior secured bridge loan and US$8bn in senior unsecured bridge loans that will be replaced by high-yield bonds. Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and RBC are providing the debt.  “The challenge with T-Mobile and Sprint is a very long regulatory period – 12 to 24 months of intense scrutiny,” said a senior banker.  Banks are being judicious, he said, moderating exposure to the huge deals to leave room for oncoming deals and to manage potentially long regulatory reviews that could tie up balance sheets. “It’s not so much that banks are at capacity, but wanting to keep capacity open, because everybody sees a very strong and building pipeline for M&A; and they hate to be stopped out of the next deals because they just locked up their balance sheet,” the senior banker said. Online retailer Amazon’s unconventional mash-up with grocery chain Whole Foods Market last summer has raised the stakes for atypical mergers, especially in industries where behemoth Amazon is perceived to be a potential competitor.  “Companies are trying to come up with the next killer combination or economic coupling that will generate more profit than traditional business models,” another senior banker said. As the push for diversification and profit heats up, technology and healthcare are among the leaders in consolidation. CVS Health Corp on Wednesday said it still expects its US$69bn deal to buy health insurer Aetna Inc, announced last December, to close during this year’s second half. That merger was followed in March by Cigna Corp’s plan to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts for US$52bn. A rising tide of cross-border deals is also contributing to the global M&A; spike.  There is the £23bn loan for US cable operator Comcast’s bid for London-based Sky and a potential new jumbo loan for Japanese drug company Takeda Pharmaceutical’s US$64bn offer for London-listed rare disease specialist Shire. Lower US corporate tax rates and ready US cash stockpiles to put to work overseas are among factors driving the push across international lines. Also, Brexit uncertainty is encouraging some Continental European and Asian firms to look at the US and UK companies to look abroad.   “Clearly we are in a boom,” the first senior banker said. “Now four months into the year, the pace may normalize, but while it may be tough to maintain this breakneck pace, I don’t think that means it will be done or fall off sharply.” ",5042018,http://www.reuters.com/article/t-mobile-ma/t-mobile-adds-to-record-ma-spree-idUSL1N1SB0LJ
1262,CMCSA,Comcast formally notifies Brussels of intention to bid for Sky,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast (CMCSA.O) has formally notified the European Commission of its intention to bid for Britain’s pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L), starting the clock on a review, a regulatory source told Reuters on Monday.  Comcast is racing to get ahead of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) in the battle to buy the European company, and the notification in Brussels is a key requirement. The Commission can clear the 22 billion-pound ($30 billion) bid with or without conditions or it can open a four-month investigation if it has serious concerns about the deal. The deadline for a decision is June 14.   Comcast, the world’s biggest entertainment company, stunned the industry in February when it made an informal bid for Sky, taking on Fox which is in the final stages of its own bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own.  Comcast made its bid formal in April and the notification in Brussels starts the clock on the regulatory review. It is keen to show Sky’s investors that it can get through the regulatory process quickly, unlike Fox which has faced repeated delays since it first agreed a takeover of Sky in December 2016.  The Fox-Sky deal has been held up by concerns about the influence Murdoch could wield over public opinion through owning all of the broadcaster as well as British newspapers The Times and The Sun. Fox has offered a raft of remedies to gain regulatory approval, such as protecting the independence and funding of Sky’s news division. The original Fox-Sky combination has also been further complicated by Fox’s agreement to sell many of its TV and film assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), including its stake in Sky, for $52 billion (37 billion pounds). Comcast has so far made the higher offer, at 12.50 pounds a share compared with Fox’s 10.75 pounds. Investors in Sky expect Fox to return with a higher offer if it can secure approval from Britain’s media secretary, who is reviewing that bid.

1265,CMCSA,Exclusive: Comcast prepares all-cash bid to gate-crash Disney-Fox deal - sources,"(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp is asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it can make an all-cash offer for the media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has agreed to sell to Walt Disney Co for $52 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts only plans to proceed with the bid if a federal judge allows AT&T; Inc’s planned $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc to proceed, the sources said. The U.S. Department of Justice has opposed the AT&T-Time; Warner deal over antitrust concerns, and a decision from U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon is expected in June. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger clinched an all-stock deal with Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch in December to acquire Fox’s film, television and international businesses, giving the world’s largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. Comcast, owner of NBC and Universal Pictures, has also made a 22 billion pound ($30 billion) offer to acquire the 61 percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky Plc that Fox does not already own. In doing so, it topped an earlier offer for the entirety of Sky by Fox. Last November, Comcast offered to acquire most of Fox’s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, or $64 billion, a regulatory filing showed last month. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox’s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the filing shows. Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. In the regulatory filing, Disney and Fox cited regulatory hurdles as reasons to reject Comcast’s bid, even though they did not reference it by name. The exact value of Comcast’s new bid for the Fox assets is not yet clear, although the $60 billion in new financing indicates it is seeking significant firepower to outbid Disney. Comcast already has a $30 billion bridge loan to finance its Sky offer. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Comcast, Fox and Disney declined to comment. Fox shares rose 5.13 percent to $39.99 on the news in after-hours trading in New York on Monday. Comcast shares were down 1.5 percent to $31.90, while Disney shares were down 0.5 percent to $102.00.  Murdoch, who owns close to a 17 percent stake in Fox and holds about 40 percent of the voting power, prefers to be paid in stock rather than cash for the Fox assets, because this makes the transaction non-taxable for shareholders, sources have said. It is not clear how receptive he would be to an all-cash offer. Last month’s regulatory filing also showed that Fox viewed Disney’s stock as more valuable than Comcast’s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure. Comcast’s stock has dropped since then, from around $38 to about $32 now, giving the company a market capitalization of $149 billion.  Disney has committed to share buybacks as a way of returning cash to Fox shareholders. As a result, Comcast sees an opening in being disruptive to the deal by making an all-cash bid, according to the sources.  In its deal with Disney, Fox agreed to separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly listed company that it will spin off to its shareholders.

Stocks were lower for most part of the morning before sharply paring losses after CNN reported Trump was expected to impose sanctions on Iran, but may also allow for “a grace period that may offer the deal’s proponents an opening to negotiate.” But those moves evaporated just as quickly after the New York Times reported that Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron the United States was going to pull out. Macron’s office later said Trump had not given the French leader any indication of his decision. The announcement will be made at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). “We’re getting conflicting reports about the Iran deal. The market will struggle until we get clarity on this,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. Crude prices  were down more than 2 percent, easing from steeper losses after the CNN report. The S&P; energy sector, which led a rally on Wall Street in the past two days, was down 0.7 percent. “There’s just a lot of uncertainty right now with respect to what the announcement will be and what the effect on oil prices could be as a result, so people are trading every which way,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. At 12:36 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 77.12 points, or 0.32 percent, at 24,280.20, the S&P; 500 was down 8.27 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,664.36 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 18.18 points, or 0.25 percent, at 7,247.03. The CBOE Volatility Index rose 0.28 points to 15.03, gaining for the first time in four sessions. The S&P; financial sector was up 0.6 percent, and along with the industrials group, was the only other gainer among the 11 major S&P; sectors. Citigroup rose 3.4 percent after activist investor ValueAct invested $1.2 billion in the bank, citing its low risk and reliable revenue. Comcast fell 4.8 percent after Reuters reported the cable operator is preparing to make an all-cash offer for media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox has agreed to sell to Disney for $52 billion. Disney, which is due to report its results after markets close, was down 1.4 percent. Fox’s shares rose 0.1 percent. The Dow Jones Transport Index jumped 0.8 percent on boost from logistics company Expeditors, which jumped 7.8 percent after reporting strong first-quarter earnings. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.54-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.05-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P; index recorded 15 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 96 new highs and 32 new lows.

1268,CMCSA,Fox shares rise 3 percent on potential Comcast offer,"(Reuters) - Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc rose as much as 3.4 percent on Tuesday after Reuters reported that cable operator Comcast Corp was preparing an all-cash bid to rival a deal agreed late last year with Walt Disney Co. Comcast, the world’s biggest entertainment company, is asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it can make an offer for Fox’s media assets, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Disney in December had offered to buy film, television and international businesses from Fox for $52.4 billion in stock to beef up its offering against streaming rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. A handful of notes from Wall Street analysts said Comcast’s involvement was likely to push Disney to raise its existing offer.  Disney shares fell 1 percent in morning trade in New York, while Comcast’s dipped 3.5 percent to $31.25.  “It is reasonable to expect Disney to counter any potential offer while also changing the composition of its current all-stock offer,” Jefferies analyst Scott Goldman said.  “Comcast and Disney are likely to view this as the last remaining transformational deal in media.” He also pointed to the huge increase in Comcast’s debt the acquisition of both Fox and British pay-TV group Sky for almost $100 billion in total would generate. “Investors have considered such a move ever since Comcast inserted itself in the race for control of Sky,” Jefferies’ Goldman said. “However, investors likely have not contemplated an all-cash bid, which would take pro forma leverage to around 4.5 times, including synergies, intensifying the balance sheet debate.” Comcast stepped up its push to buy UK-based Sky on Tuesday, keen to prove that it will face fewer regulatory hurdles in its $31 billion pursuit of Sky compared to Fox.  Fox is in the final stages of a bid to buy the 61 percent of the UK broadcaster it does not already own but at 10.75 pounds a share compared with Comcast’s 12.50 pounds has so far made the lower offer.      Shares of Fox were last up 2.2 percent at $38.86.  “Assuming Fox continues to pursue a deal with Disney, Fox will need to raise its bid for Sky from its current level ... in order to win control,” UBS analysts wrote in a note to clients.

1269,CMCSA,"Comcast races to secure regulatory, political approval for Sky deal","LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. group Comcast stepped up its push to buy European pay-TV group Sky on Tuesday, seeking regulatory and political approval even as it maneuvers for a broader deal with bid rival, Rupert Murdoch’s Fox. Comcast, the world’s biggest entertainment company, set out its plans to keep Sky’s news output independent and fully funded for 10 years to address any political concerns that a takeover could damage Britain’s news market.  Its formal notification to the European Commission of its intention to buy Sky also put it on a similar regulatory timetable to Fox, despite entering the race 14 months later, with verdicts on both bids due next month.  Comcast is keen to prove to Sky’s shareholders that it will face fewer regulatory hurdles in its $30 billion pursuit of Sky than Murdoch’s Fox which has faced repeated delays in its bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own.  On Monday the bid battle, which already involves three of the world’s biggest media companies after Disney agreed to buy some Fox assets including Sky, took a further twist when Reuters reported that Comcast is seeking to disrupt the broader Fox-Disney deal by preparing its own counter bid.  According to three people familiar with the matter, Comcast is asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it can make an all-cash offer for the media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has agreed to sell to Walt Disney Co. “As these big groups look to fight off the threat from the likes of Netflix and Amazon then scale becomes more and more important and you need scale and distribution,” Numis media analyst Paul Richards said.  “You can see why the Fox assets are so important and Sky is rolled in with that.” Sky is a British-based European pay-TV group that offers services in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.  It agreed to be sold to its founder and 39-percent owner Fox in December 2016 but regulators and politicians have repeatedly intervened over concerns that the newspaper-owning Murdoch will have too much influence in Britain.  With Fox focused on getting approval, Comcast made its own shock bid for Sky in February, promising an easier approval process and a higher offer. It made its bid formal last month, and on Monday it notified the European Commission and will get an initial verdict on June 15.  On Tuesday it said it had agreed legally binding guarantees with Sky to fund its award-winning news output and to create a board to oversee its independence.  “The Sky News Binding Commitments will constitute legally binding commitments on Comcast and Sky which will be enforceable by the Sky News Board,” Comcast said in a statement.  Murdoch’s Fox has set out its own undertakings to protect the funding and independence of Sky News and is waiting to hear from Britain’s media secretary on whether Fox should be allowed to buy Sky. The government will give its verdict on that offer on June 13.

1275,CMCSA,U.S. Senate to vote to reinstate open internet rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is set to vote in the coming week on rejecting the Federal Communications Commission decision in December to repeal Obama-era rules guaranteeing an open internet. Proponents currently have the backing of 47 Democrats and two independents who caucus with Democrats as well as Republican Senator Susan Collins. With the prolonged absence of Senator John McCain due to illness, proponents believe they will win on a 50-49 vote. Senate Democrats on Wednesday will officially file petition to force a net neutrality vote and 10 hours of floor debate under the Congressional Review Act. Advocates believe the Senate will vote before the end of next week. The FCC in December voted 3-2 to reverse Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain online content. The new FCC rules, once effective, would give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but include new transparency requirements that require them to disclose any changes to consumers. The FCC has not yet disclosed when the new rules will be effective, but officials have said the commission will likely give at least 30 days notice before the rules officially take effect. The FCC could soon formally publish the effective date in the coming days, officials say. If the Senate approves the measure, the measure would not likely pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives or survive a veto by President Donald Trump. In February, a coalition of 22 state attorneys general refiled legal challenges intended to block the Trump administration’s repeal of net neutrality.  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has said often he is confident the order will be upheld. The repeal of the net neutrality rules was a victory for internet service providers like AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, conferring power over what content consumers can access. On the other side, technology companies including Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc have thrown their weight behind the congressional bid to reverse the repeal. Democrats have repeatedly said they believe the issue would be big in the mid-term election, especially among younger internet-savvy voters. Republicans have said the FCC vote would eliminate heavy-handed government regulations, encourage investment and return the internet to pre-2015 rules.

1277,CMCSA,Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,"LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. The recent U.S. tax changes are estimated to have reduced annual personal taxes by $115.5 billion. That means more money in the pockets of consumers, who drive two-thirds of the economy. Now that the personal income tax season has come and gone, and the bulk of taxpayer refunds has found their way into people’s pockets, did consumers spend more? In fact, economists polled by Reuters see April retail sales, due on May 15, growing just 0.4 percent, moderating from March’s 0.6 percent rise. But excluding the automobile sector, sales are expected to increase 0.5 percent, after 0.2 percent in March. Economists reckon the data will help shape the debate over how many times the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Bond markets currently are betting on at least two more increases. The combination of extra spending and tax cuts frontloaded the positives, and now we wait to see if it translates into robust economic performance. Traders see Fed on track to raise interest rates in June U.S. consumer prices rebound modestly in April Oil prices are at the highest since 2014 and the surge shows no sign of waning. In fact, $80 a barrel is within sight for Brent crude. The U.S. decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions has pushed Brent 3 percent higher this week, its biggest of five consecutive weekly rises. It is now up 60 percent over the past year. Iranian oil exports should start falling as the new sanctions take hold. Even if other OPEC countries manage to fill that gap, the global oil market is still pretty finely balanced. Brent could reach $90 per barrel in the second quarter next year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts, adding that $100 cannot be ruled out. The question is now how this will impact inflation and central bank policy. Inflationary pressures in the developed world remain muted, but economic textbooks suggest not for long. - Oil near multi-year highs as Iran sanctions tighten supply outlook - COLUMN-Oil price rise poses challenge for sanctions policy: Kemp - ANALYST VIEW-Oil markets weigh fallout as U.S. quits Iran deal M&A; action has been hotting up in Europe, with April recording the highest value of monthly deals in 10 years, according to Thomson Reuters data. This week, we’ve had a private equity firm agreeing to buy Zoopla-owner ZPG, sending its shares to a record high and lifting other online consumer-focused firms such as Auto Trader and RightMove. Japan’s Takeda is buying Shire for $62 billion and U.S. cable giant Comcast is seeking approval for its bid to buy British pay-TV group Sky. The UK, in particular, is drawing attention from foreign buyers due to the still-depressed levels of the pound and the fact that stocks trade at a discount to their long-run average on a 12-month forward PE basis. Credit Suisse Wealth Management added UK equities to their most preferred markets, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch say they are rotating from Europe to the UK. The Euro Stoxx index is close to fully regaining all the ground lost during the February volatility shock, while the UK’s FTSE 100 is flat on the year, after being down as much as 10 percent some weeks back. Deal-making activity could provide the lift into positive territory for both benchmarks. - Britain’s Zoopla, PrimeLocation bought by Silver Lake for $3 bln - Takeda agrees $62 billion takeover of Shire - Comcast races to secure regulatory, political approval for Sky deal After weeks of wrangling, Italy may soon get a new government made up of the far-right League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. But for markets, which have so far taken Italian political risks in their stride, a League/5-Star tie-up is the worst-case scenario; both groups are hostile to EU budget restrictions and have made electoral pledges that would cost billions of euros to implement. No wonder the cost of insuring Italian debt against default have crept up, bond yields have hit 7-week highs and shares are set for their biggest weekly fall in seven weeks . The Italian/German bond yield gap, a key indicator of relative risks, has also widened. But it remains below levels seen before the March 4 election; clearly some investors are still willing to look beyond the politics. After all, a week is a long time in politics and the two parties are yet to agree on who will be prime minister.

The cost of insuring against default on Malaysian debt MYGV5YUSAC=R rose to more than 90 basis points from 78 before the election.  The fear is that Mahathir, who was in power for 22 years until 2003, including during the late-1990s financial crisis, will fulfill pledges to remove the goods and services tax, scrap toll fees, reinstate fuel subsidies and renegotiate Chinese investment deals.  That would hit budget revenues. Mahathir has also vowed anti-corruption reform, but whether better governance can be achieved remains to be seen. For now, uncertainty takes center stage.    - Veteran Malaysian leader Mahathir scores shock election win- Malaysian markets leery over Najib’s defeat, Mahathir’s return- Mahathir’s shock Malaysian election win raises populist economics spectre- Malaysia central bank holds key rate as election shock spurs economy concerns.
