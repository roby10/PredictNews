1,CHTR,Time Warner Cable to buy Insight for $3 billion,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable said it will buy cable operator Insight Communications from Carlyle Group for $3 billion in cash to broaden its presence in the U.S. Midwest.  The deal was reached after months of negotiations and a fruitless auction of Insight that involved other strategic and private equity bidders, including Cablevision Systems Corp and Charter Communications.  TWC dropped out of the auction because it believed Carlyle was asking for too much, TWC Chief Executive Glenn Britt told Reuters in an interview on Monday.  Carlyle originally was seeking $3.5 billion to $4 billion, sources said earlier this year.  “We’ve been very consistent in saying that we would only buy at the right price — one where we think there’s a good return for our owners,” said Britt.  Executives at TWC have said any acquisition targets will not be valued at higher multiples than TWC’s own stock.  Insight is the 10th-largest cable operator in the United States. It sells cable television, high-speed Internet and telephone services and serves 750,000 customers in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.  TWC, the No. 2 U.S. cable operator, believes it can create annual cost efficiencies of around $100 million through programing expense savings and cost reductions.  It also expects tax benefits from inheriting Insight’s $300 million in net operating losses.  “We will continue to return excess capital to shareholders consistent with our target leverage ratio of 3.25 times, including the impact of this acquisition on our existing and expected leverage,” TWC Chief Financial Officer Irene Esteves said in a statement.  Insight is owned by private equity firms Carlyle Group, Crestview Partners and MidOcean Partners, and Insight management.  It is TWC’s biggest acquisition since it was spun off from former parent Time Warner Inc in 2009. Earlier this year it paid $260 million for NewWave Communications, a small cable operator with cable systems in the Midwest.  TWC shares were down 27 cents to $65.24 in early trading.

2,CHTR,Formerly bankrupt companies become M&A; targets,"NEW YORK/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Hundreds of businesses crawling out of bankruptcy in the hands of hedge funds and other financial owners are hanging the “for sale” sign on their doors.  Distressed debt investors such as Paulson & Co, Avenue Capital and Silver Point Capital that took control of bankrupt companies during the financial crisis are looking to cash in on their investments as the economy recovers.  As a result, once-bankrupt companies in sectors such as auto parts, media, chemicals and technology that ended up in the hands of hedge funds and buyout shops are expected to come to the market soon, bankers said.  “There are some great brand names that are being rehabilitated and re-purposed into healthier companies,” said one investment banker, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. “There will be demand for them when they come off the shelf.”  Some already are. Auto parts supplier Cooper Standard COSH.OB, which came out of bankruptcy in May 2010 under the control of hedge funds including Silver Point and Oak Hill Advisors, is shopping itself.  Delphi Corp, with Silver Point and Elliott Management among its owners, is planning an initial public offering.  Others such as Dura Automotive, in which Patriarch Partners has a majority stake, and Lear Corp (LEA.N), owned partly by Goldman Sachs (GS.N), could hit the market in the next year or two, bankers said.  Paulson and Avenue declined to comment. Silver Point and the auto suppliers could not be reached for comment.  Media companies in a similar situation are likely to consolidate, and direct marketing companies in particular could be next, restructuring bankers said.  That includes Vertis Holdings, brought out of bankruptcy by GE Capital (GE.N) and Avenue, and Source Interlink, which emerged with JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM.N) help.  Other media companies that came into financial ownership through bankruptcy include Charter Communications (CHTR.O), partly owned by Apollo Management (APO.N); RHI Entertainment, the Journal Register, Young Broadcasting, and ION Media Networks.  “Some of the now-bankrupt media companies still have broad customer bases and strong franchises,” one of the bankers said. “Once that gets fixed and repackaged, these can be viable companies again.”  Technology companies such as Satelites Mexicanos and MagnaChip Semiconductor Corp (MX.N) have also emerged from bankruptcy in hedge fund and investor hands in the past two years.  In the chemicals sector, companies such as Tronox Inc TROX.PK find themselves in a similar situation.  The companies could not be reached for comment.  Bankruptcy tends to be more of a playground for hedge funds than strategic buyers scouring for targets.  Most corporations interested in acquiring troubled companies prefer to wait until a bankruptcy is complete, said Barry Ridings, vice chairman of U.S. investment banking and co-head of restructuring at Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N).  Bankruptcy reorganizations might include closing unprofitable or nonstrategic divisions, shutting down plants and solving issues with unions or other workers, Ridings said.  Hedge fund owners can keep bankruptcy costs down as they push for quick changes and an exit, said David Resnick, chairman of the Global Financing Advisory group at Rothschild.  “They’re measured by their return on their investment, so they are very sensitive to getting something done sooner rather than later,” Resnick said.  It is not that strategics never buy these ugly ducklings. Investor Charles Ergen purchased three bankrupt companies for his Dish and Echostar Corp (SATS.O) businesses in 2011.  “There’s value received if you are willing to enter a complex, contentious situation,” Resnick said. “Some people say that the value they’d be getting just isn’t worth it.”  (Reporting by Caroline Humer and Jessica Hall; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and John Wallace)  ",9012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-dealtalk-bankruptcy/formerly-bankrupt-companies-become-ma-targets-idUSTRE78036N20110901

4,CHTR,"UPDATE 2-Melrose sees sales boost from energy, mining","* Year Pretax profit 161 mln pounds, vs forecast 157 mln * Year sales up 11 pct to 1.15 bln pounds, in line with poll * Order book supports estimates of 5 pct sales growth * COO Simon Peckham to take over as CEO from David Roper * Shares up 2.1 percent By Adveith Nair LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - British manufacturing buyout group Melrose posted full-year profit at the top end of expectations and said strong energy and mining markets meant it was set for further growth. “The strong end-markets we have are proving their worth,” finance director Geoffrey Martin told Reuters. “We are 50 percent into energy, oil & gas and mining, which are good places to be in right now.” Melrose’s 2011 pretax profit rose 32 percent to 161 million pounds ($254 million), compared with a forecast for 157 million. Sales, 11 percent higher at 1.15 billion pounds, were in line. Martin said market expectations for 2012 sales to rise 5 percent to 1.21 billion pounds were supported by the company’s order book. “In the energy division, orders came in about 9 percent faster than sales last year. In lifting, they came in 5 percent faster than sales.” Those two divisions accounted for more than 80 percent of 2011 sales 2011. Investec Securities analyst Chris Dyett said: “The group’s primary exposures are to end-markets (oil & gas, mining) where the outlook is increasingly positive. With a set of businesses in rude health, we feel sufficiently confident to upgrade our full-year 2012 estimates”. Shares in Melrose, which looks to buy underperforming industrial businesses and sell them after restructuring, were up 2.10 percent at 378 pence at 1010 GMT. The company said it was more certain a suitable acquisition opportunity would arise given current market conditions. Chief operating officer and founder director Simon Peckham would take over as chief executive from David Roper at its next annual general meeting, Melrose said. Roper, also a founder director, will become executive vice-chairman.",3072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/melrose/update-2-melrose-sees-sales-boost-from-energy-mining-idUSL5E8E70K720120307

12,CHTR,Time Warner Cable signs two Lakers deals as clock ticks,"(Reuters) - Time Warner Cable, under pressure to sign TV distributors to cover the costs of its deal to carry Los Angeles Lakers games, reached agreements with Charter Communications and Verizon four days before the basketball team’s first home game, the companies said on Friday. “Charter is the first provider of this brand new programming in our service areas, and we know that the addition of these networks especially pleases our customers in Southern California,” said Allan Singer, Charter’s senior vice president of programming. Time Warner Cable also said late on Friday that its month-old Time Warner Cable SportsNet and companion Spanish-language sports channel Time Warner Cable Deportes had agreed to terms with Verizon’s Fios TV service. The cable operator said details would be announced in the coming days. Los Angeles-area cable and satellite operators had balked at paying the average monthly fee of $3.95 per subscriber it was charging for the two regional sports networks, which will air local broadcasts of the National Basketball Association’s Lakers and Major League Soccer’s Los Angeles Galaxy. Time Warner Cable needs distributor fees to help pay for the contract it reached with the Lakers in February 2011. Barclays analyst James Ratcliffe has estimated that the local broadcasting rights will cost about $2 billion over 20 years. Until Friday’s agreements, the only fans able to watch local broadcasts of new Lakers stars Dwight Howard and Steve Nash were the 2 million who subscribe to Time Warner Cable and subscribers of the small Bright House Networks in Bakersfield, Calif. Verizon has about 461,000 pay TV subscribers in the Los Angeles market while Charter has about 292,000, according to data from SNL Kagan. Besides Charter, Time Warner Cable needs to sign contracts with satellite broadcasters DirecTV and Dish Network and with Cox Cable to carry 53 of the Lakers’ 82 games carried by Time Warner Cable. The rest are national games that will be telecast by ESPN, TNT and ABC. On October 24, Cox, which has 1.2 million subscribers in Southern California, said it was rebuffed in its offer to carry the two channels on a specialty tier that would offer a portion of its customers other sports channels. “We are committed to meeting the needs of all Cox customers, not just sports fans,” Cox said in a statement. “The price for the Lakers is one of the highest wholesale prices that we have seen.” ",10272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lakers-cable-deal/time-warner-cable-signs-two-lakers-deals-as-clock-ticks-idUSBRE89Q00Z20121027

18,CHTR,Social media dispute resolution stumps some companies,"(Reuters) - If HBO cuts out on you in the middle of the latest “Girls” episode, and you have Charter Communications Inc as your cable provider, don’t try tweeting your dismay to their customer service department. Nobody will hear your lament. Charter, the fourth largest cable provider in the U.S. with 5.2 million customers across 25 states, closed up its social-media based customer service team in December. “Umatter2Charter,” as it was known, had been taking customer complaints over Twitter and Facebook and trying to resolve them, but the company says it is now done with working out customer service issues in social media forums. The move, which might seem to conflict with the growth of social media, highlights the difficulty some businesses are having with free-flowing, round-the-clock social media, its public nature and the expectation of immediate responses. With Facebook users numbering about a billion and Twitter drawing 200 million, it might be hard to believe that any retail enterprise would drop out of the fray, but Charter isn’t the only major company to announce such a move. Also in December, the largest single grocery store in New England - the Wegmans in Northborough, Massachusetts - shuttered its Facebook page despite having some 8,000 fans. “It’s a tough sport,” says J.D. Peterson, vice president of product marketing for San Francisco-based Zendesk, which helps companies manage customer service. “The real-time nature of it - at times the volume that can come from it - it’s very new and different for businesses.” While Peterson’s company recommends going where the customers are - and a big chunk are clearly on social media - Peterson says not all businesses share the same philosophy or have the ability to engage those consumers in these open forums. But any company that has a significant online presence doesn’t really have a choice, he says, working with consumers through social media is expected of them. Advocates for the use social media say the challenge actually presents an opportunity for businesses - showing they are responsive to complaints and care about their customers can bring in revenue. “I have seen this time and time again, and the end result is that the interaction often turns an irate customer into an advocate for the brand. And that is worth it’s weight in gold,” says Mike Rowan, chief marketing office for Atlanta-based Swarm, which manages social media for companies. That’s certainly the way retailer Lands’ End, a division of Sears Holdings Corp, sees it. “When we started using social media tools like Facebook and Twitter in early 2009, it gave us a new opportunity to do what we’ve done for 50 years, which is connect with our customers,” says Michele Casper, Lands’ End’s senior director of public relations. “Whether it is through social media, our call centers or online, we offer the same level of customer service through each channel.” Charter says it is not walking away completely from social media - just the idea of providing customer service via Twitter. The company says it has ample other avenues for consumers to get help - including telephone, customer service counters and live chat on its web page. “We communicate with thousands of customers each day on the phone and in person, and that’s where we’ll focus our efforts,” says Charter spokeswoman Anita Lamont. “While social media is a method some consumers choose to seek help, Charter offers phone and web-based contact solutions where all customers can access resources to provide assistance.” The abandonment of the Facebook page at the Massachusetts Wegmans store, which caused a great fuss among the store’s “fans,” was, in large part, due to the inability to respond quickly enough to consumers. Store personnel couldn’t break off enough time from their other roles to constantly monitor the page, Wegmans spokeswoman Jo Natale says, allowing comments to sit unanswered - a no-no in the world of social media. “Our top priority has always been, and will continue to be, providing incredible service to customers who shop in our stores,” she says. “And it isn’t as though there aren’t other avenues for folks to connect with us if they have a question or concern.” As much as customers expressed surprise and dissatisfaction at the decision, Natale says, it came down to a decision that if the store couldn’t serve the Facebook page at a level it felt was expected that it shouldn’t do it at all. “They quickly discovered, once the store opened and got very, very busy, that it wasn’t so easy to stay on top of comments or to find the time to post,” Natale says. “In a retail operation like ours, there isn’t anyone sitting at a PC or checking a mobile device throughout the day. It’s a fast-paced business that requires our people to be on the floor serving customers.” (The author is a Reuters contributor.

Store personnel couldn’t break off enough time from their other roles to constantly monitor the page, Wegmans spokeswoman Jo Natale says, allowing comments to sit unanswered - a no-no in the world of social media. “Our top priority has always been, and will continue to be, providing incredible service to customers who shop in our stores,” she says. “And it isn’t as though there aren’t other avenues for folks to connect with us if they have a question or concern.” As much as customers expressed surprise and dissatisfaction at the decision, Natale says, it came down to a decision that if the store couldn’t serve the Facebook page at a level it felt was expected that it shouldn’t do it at all. “They quickly discovered, once the store opened and got very, very busy, that it wasn’t so easy to stay on top of comments or to find the time to post,” Natale says. “In a retail operation like ours, there isn’t anyone sitting at a PC or checking a mobile device throughout the day. It’s a fast-paced business that requires our people to be on the floor serving customers.” (The author is a Reuters contributor.

25,CHTR,TEXT-Fitch affirms Charter Communication's IDR at 'BB-';outlook stable,"Feb 11 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ‘BB-‘ Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) assigned to CCO Holdings, LLC (CCOH) and Charter Communications  Operating, LLC (CCO).  Each of CCOH and CCO are indirect wholly owned  subsidiaries of Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter).  Fitch has also affirmed  the specific issue ratings assigned to Charter’s various subsidiaries as  outlined below.  The Rating Outlook for all of Charter’s ratings is Stable.  Approximately $13.7 billion of debt (principal value) outstanding as of Sept.  30, 2012 is affected by Fitch’s action. —Acquisition of Bresnan Broadband Holdings, LLC (Bresnan) neutral to Charter’s  ratings; —Bresnan acquisition fits strategically and will not generate meaningful cost  synergies or present integration risks; —Expected improvement in Charter’s credit profile likely delayed by Bresnan  acquisition. The affirmation of Charter’s ratings follows the company’s announcement that it  intends to purchase Bresnan Broadband Holdings, LLC for $1.625 billion in cash.   Fitch anticipates the debt funded acquisition will modestly increase Charter’s  leverage; however, leverage will remain within Fitch’s expectations for the  rating.  Charter’s leverage will increase to approximately 5.1x on a pro forma  basis as of the latest 12 months (LTM) period ending Sept. 30, 2012 after giving  consideration for the incremental debt associated with the proposed transaction  and Bresnan’s EBITDA generation. Bresnan operates cable systems in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah passing  approximately 666,000 homes.  The acquisition is in line with Charter’s strategy  to provide service in largely secondary and rural markets.  However, Bresnan’s  cable service area does not complement Charter’s existing service footprint so  the acquisition will not generate any meaningful operational synergies (outside  of programming cost savings) or create integration risks. From Fitch’s  perspective Bresnan has a relatively strong operating profile.  Bresnan’s  service penetration rates, revenue and EBITDA growth metrics are stronger than  Charter’s. Charter’s capital structure and financial strategy remains consistent and  centers on simplifying its debt structure, extending its maturity profile while  reducing leverage to its target range of 4x to 4.5x. Pro forma leverage remains  outside the company’s target at 5.1x for the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2012.   Fitch had expected Charter’s credit profile would improve modestly during 2013,  however the incremental debt associated with the acquisition will slow the pace  of improvement.  Fitch now anticipates Charter’s leverage will remain close to  5x at the end of 2013 before declining somewhat to 4.6x by the end of 2014. Fitch believes that Charter has sufficient capacity within the current ratings  to accommodate changes to the company’s operating strategy and plans to maintain  a higher level of capital expenditures (relative to historical norms and peer  comparisons).  In Fitch’s opinion, the strategy shift along with higher level of  capital expenditures will lead to a stronger overall competitive position.  The  changes to Charter’s operating strategy support the company’s overall strategic  objectives, set the foundation for sustainable growth while creating more  efficient operating profile.  However, Fitch expects the strategy will hinder  free cash flow generation and strain EBITDA margins during 2013 limiting overall  financial flexibility and slowing the company’s progress to achieving its  leverage target.  During the short term, Fitch believes that customer  connections, revenue and expense metrics will be negatively impacted. Charter’s more viable capital structure has positioned the company to generate  positive free cash flow.  However Fitch expects free cash flow generation during  2012 and 2013 will suffer from the effects of lower operating margin and higher  capital intensity.  Charter generated approximately $193 million of free cash  flow during the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2012 down markedly from the $426  million of free cash flow produced during the year-ended 2011.  Fitch  anticipates Charter will generate between $250 million and $300 million of free  cash flow during 2013 and produce between $450 million to $500 million during  2014 when stronger margins return. Rating concerns center on Charter’s elevated financial leverage (relative to  other large cable MSOs), a comparatively weaker subscriber clustering and  operating profile.  Moreover, Charter’s ability to adapt to the evolving  operating environment while maintaining its relative competitive position given  the challenging competitive environment and weak housing and employment trends  remains a key consideration. Charter’s liquidity position is adequate given the current rating and is  supported by $868 million of cash on hand as of Sept. 30, 2012 (Fitch notes that  $768 million of cash was used to fund the partial redemption of CCH II senior  notes in October 2012), borrowing capacity from CCO’s $1.15 billion revolver  (all of which was available as of Sept. 30, 2012) and expected free cash flow  generation.  Fitch notes that amounts available for borrowing under CCO’s  revolver was approximately $715 million after giving effect for the redemption  of the remaining $468 million of CCH II’s senior notes in November 2012. Charter has successfully extended its maturity profile as only 5.8% of  outstanding debt as of Sept. 30, 2012 is scheduled to mature before 2016, $267  million and $418 million during 2013 and 2014 respectively.  Fitch anticipates  that a large portion of near term maturities will retired with current cash and  future free cash flow generation.  Refinancing risk elevates during 2016 when  approximately $1.5 billion of bank debt is scheduled to mature. —Positive rating actions would be contemplated as leverage declines below 4.5x. —The company demonstrates progress in closing gaps relative to its industry  peers on service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives. —Operating profile strengthens as the company captures sustainable revenue and  cash flow growth envisioned when implementing the current operating strategy. —Fitch believes negative rating actions would likely coincide with a leveraging  transaction that increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the absence of a credible  deleveraging plan; —Adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy; —A perceived weakening of Charter’s competitive position or failure of the  current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth  along with strengthening operating margins. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: CCO Holdings, LLC —IDR at ‘BB-‘; —Senior secured term loan at ‘BB+’; —Senior unsecured debt at ‘BB-‘. Charter Communications Operating, LLC —IDR at ‘BB-‘; —Senior secured credit facility at ‘BB+’.",2112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N0BB2EB20130211

Malone, who has been nicknamed “the king of cable,” founded Tele-Communications Inc, or TCI, which he grew into the largest cable operator in the United States before selling it to AT&T; Inc. Malone is also the chairman of Liberty Global, the international cable operator that purchased Virgin Media Inc, a UK company, for about $15.75 billion in February.

33,CHTR,Liberty eyes cable TV deals after Charter investment,"(Reuters) - Liberty Media Corp will buy a 27 percent stake in Charter Communications Inc, signaling Chairman John Malone’s return to his roots in cable television and a renewed appetite for consolidation in the sector.

Private equity firm Apollo Management was also in a “selling mood,” Maffei said. “I do think this is a statement about cable in the sense that we see the opportunity,” Maffei said in an interview, adding that Charter’s subscription model and sustainable cash flow is “our kind of business.” Liberty will take a 27.3 percent stake in Charter for about $2.62 billion. It cannot raise its stake above 35 percent until January 2016, when it is allowed to increase its ownership to 39.99 percent. If it wants to raise its stake above that, it would need to negotiate with the company, Maffei said. Liberty will pay $95.50 for each Charter share, a discount of 2.6 percent to Charter’s Monday close of $98.04. The deal is expected to close in the first half of the second quarter. Liberty will buy the stake from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners, the companies said in a joint statement.

Malone “is probably going to have a pretty big say in the company’s future over the next few years.

Asked if Charter would repurchase shares, Maffei said it was too early to tell and Liberty would have to consult management. Charter provides video, Internet, and telephone services to about 5.2 million residential and business customers in 25 U.S. states, trailing Time Warner Cable and Comcast. ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said now is a good time for Malone to re-enter the U.S. cable market while there are low interest rates and signs of an improving housing market. Charter is in the midst of a turnaround. The company, once controlled by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, filed for bankruptcy in 2009 but has emerged and is now led by Cablevision’s former chief operating officer Tom Rutledge. “We expect the turnaround underway at Charter by its relatively new management team will make it the highest-growth U.S. cable operator over the next three years,” ISI’s Jayant said.

37,CHTR,Margin loan helps fund Charter stake purchase,"March 22 (IFR) - John Malone helped fund Liberty Media’s $2.6bn purchase of a 27% stake in Charter Communications this week with a margin loan, an increasingly popular funding mechanism in the US. Margin loans, collateralised by the underlying stock, help leverage returns and limit the cash funding costs of a deal. “Margin loans are relatively new in the US. They are more common in Europe but the technology transferred West about 18 months ago,” said one equity derivatives banker. “If you’re bullish and you want to achieve an IRR target (target internal rate of return), you can get there a lot faster by using a margin loan.” Liberty Media on Monday entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 26.9m shares of Charter, as well as 1.1m warrants, from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners for US$95.50 per share, a 6% premium at the time. A portion of the total consideration is expected to come from a combination of “cash and new loan arrangements”, the companies said in a statement. The purchase is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2013. Charter Communications shares closed Thursday at US$102.36, 7.1% above the agreed upon purchase price. Assuming a 70/30 split of cash and leverage, Liberty Media has returned about 10.3%, excluding the costs of the margin loan and any value to the warrants. In addition to levered returns, margin loans can provide the added benefit of certainty on execution. “Either the buyer or seller can have the financing pre-packaged prior to closing,” said a second derivatives banker. “Having the packaging self-contained simplifies the negotiations.” A seller could arrange the funding before even identifying a buyer. Another appealing factor is that margin loans are off-balance sheet, mitigating pressure on credit ratings from additional term borrowings. The lower cash consideration is certainly attractive to private equity firms. Bain Capital, for example, used a margin loan to help fund its purchase last April of a 30% stake in Genpact for US$1bn from General Atlantic and Oak Hill. That kept cash-call commitments to limited partners in addition to levering returns. “Margin loans make a lot of sense for private equity and sovereign wealth funds on concentrated investment,” said one of the bankers. “They are secured loans to buy stock on non-recourse basis, and provide flexibility to deploy cash elsewhere.” Margin loans are also used in private market transactions. A chief executive with significant capital tied up in company stock can margin those holdings, freeing up cash to diversify investment holdings or purchase other assets. Those contemplating using margin loans in the US can learn from the European experience. Five years ago, banks were restructuring rather than originating equity financing transactions, particularly for Russian and Middle East clients where the LTVs had been particularly aggressive. The business has matured since then and comprises a significant portion of corporate equity derivatives revenues each year. LTVs should not be a concern for regulators in the US as lending cannot exceed more than 50% of equity collateral - part of the reason margin loans have been so slow to cross the Atlantic. In the Charter Communications deal, it is expected to be 20%-30%.",3222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/margin-loan-charter/margin-loan-helps-fund-charter-stake-purchase-idUSL1N0CE7WU20130322
38,CHTR,Fitch Rates Charter Communications Operating Term Loan 'BB+'; Outlook Stable,,4012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-rates-charter-communications-opera/fitch-rates-charter-communications-operating-term-loan-bb-outlook-stable-idUSFit65329220130401
39,CHTR,"Fitch Rates Charter Communications Operating Term Loan 'BB+', CCOH Sr Notes 'BB-'; Outlook Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB+' senior secured  rating to Charter Communications Operating, LLC's (CCO) proposed seven-year,  $1.2 billion term loan F.  In addition Fitch has assigned a 'BB-' rating to CCO  Holdings, LLC's (CCOH) $1 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2024. Proceeds from the term loan, along with a draw from CCO's revolver are expected  to be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of a portion of  CCO's existing bank debt.  Fitch anticipates proceeds from the CCOH issuance  will be used to fund the redemption of CCOH's 7.875% senior notes due 2018.  CCO  and CCOH are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Charter Communications, Inc.  (Charter). As of Dec. 31, 2012, Charter had approximately $12.9 billion of debt  (principal value) outstanding including $3.3 billion of senior secured debt. KEY RATING DRIVERS: --The terms and conditions of term loan F are substantially similar to the  existing senior secured credit facility. --The issuance is in line with Charter's strategy to simplify its debt structure  and extend its maturity profile while reducing leverage to its target range of  4x to 4.5x. --Acquisition of Bresnan is neutral to Charter's ratings and will not generate  meaningful cost synergies or present integration risks. --Expected improvement in Charter's credit profile likely to be delayed by  Bresnan acquisition. The issuance is in line with Charter's strategy to simplify its debt structure  and extend its maturity profile while reducing leverage to its target range of  4x to 4.5x. The issuance will not result in any material improvement of the  company's credit profile, however, but reduces refinancing risk related to 2016  scheduled maturities.  Pro forma for term loan F and prior capital market  transactions, Charter's 2016 scheduled maturities are expected to be reduced to  approximately $75 million from $1.6 billion as of Dec. 31, 2012.  The near-term  maturity schedule is very manageable as only 5.9% of outstanding debt as of Dec.  31, 2012 is scheduled to mature before 2016, including $260 million and $411  million during 2013 and 2014, respectively.   Fitch's ratings incorporate Charter's pending acquisition of Bresnan Broadband  Holdings, LLC for $1.625 billion in cash.  Fitch anticipates the debt-funded  acquisition will modestly increase Charter's leverage; however, leverage will  remain within Fitch's expectations for the rating.  Charter's leverage will  increase to approximately 5.1x on a pro forma basis as of the latest 12-month  (LTM) period ending Dec. 31, 2012, after giving consideration for the  incremental debt associated with the proposed transaction and Bresnan's EBITDA  generation.  Actual leverage as of Dec. 31, 2012 was 4.75x. The incremental debt associated with the acquisition will slow the pace of  expected improvement in Charter's credit profile during 2013.  Fitch now  anticipates Charter's leverage will remain close to 5x at the end of 2013 before  declining somewhat to 4.6x by the end of 2014.    Fitch believes that Charter has sufficient capacity within the current ratings  to accommodate changes to the company's operating strategy and plans to maintain  a higher level of capital expenditures (relative to historical norms and peer  comparisons).  In Fitch's opinion, the strategy shift along with higher level of  capital expenditures will lead to a stronger overall competitive position.  The  changes to Charter's operating strategy support the company's overall strategic  objectives, setting the foundation for sustainable growth while creating a more  efficient operating profile.  However, Fitch expects the strategy will hinder  free cash flow generation and strain EBITDA margins during 2013, limiting  overall financial flexibility and slowing the company's progress to achieving  its leverage target.  During the short term, Fitch believes that customer  connections, revenue and expense metrics will be negatively impacted.     Charter generated approximately $131 million of free cash flow during the  year-ended 2012, down markedly from the $426 million of free cash flow produced  during the year-ended 2011.  Charter's more viable capital structure has  positioned the company to generate positive free cash flow.  However Fitch  expects free cash flow generation during 2013 will suffer from the effects of  lower operating margin and higher capital intensity.  Capital expenditures  during 2012 increased 33% relative to last year to approximately $1.8 billion,  representing 23% of revenues.  Fitch believes capital intensity will remain  elevated during 2013 and 2014.  Fitch anticipates Charter will generate between  $250 million and $300 million of free cash flow during 2013 and produce between  $450 million to $500 million during 2014 when stronger margins return.    Rating concerns center on Charter's elevated financial leverage (relative to  other large cable MSOs), a comparatively weaker subscriber clustering, and  operating profile.  Moreover, Charter's ability to adapt to the evolving  operating environment while maintaining its relative competitive position given  the challenging competitive environment and weak housing and employment trends  remains a key consideration. Charter's liquidity position is adequate given the current rating and is  supported by cash on hand, borrowing capacity from CCO's $1.15 billion revolver  (approximately $960 million was available as of Dec. 31, 2012 and $835 million  adjusted for the Bresnan acquisition) and expected free cash flow generation.   Charter's revolver commitment expires on April 11, 2017.  Fitch notes that  Charter is in the process of increasing the size of its revolver to $1.3 billion  and extending the maturity date into 2018.   Charter has successfully extended its maturity profile, as only 5.9% of  outstanding debt as of Dec. 31, 2012 is scheduled to mature before 2016,  including $260 million and $411 million during 2013 and 2014, respectively.   Previous capital market activity addressed the refinancing risk related to 2016  scheduled maturities.  Pro forma for CCO Holdings, LLC issuance in February  2013, 2016 scheduled maturity is reduced to approximately $591 million from $1.6  billion as of Dec. 31, 2012.     RATING SENSITIVITIES: Positive rating actions would be contemplated: --As leverage declines below 4.5x; --The company demonstrates progress in closing gaps relative to its industry  peers on service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;  --Operating profile strengthens as the company captures sustainable revenue and  cash flow growth envisioned when implementing the current operating strategy.   Fitch believes negative rating actions would likely coincide with: --A leveraging transaction that increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the absence of  a credible deleveraging plan; --Adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy; --A perceived weakening of Charter's competitive position or failure of the  current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth  along with strengthening operating margins.

44,CHTR,Liberty's Malone sees deals necessary in U.S. cable market,"SUN VALLEY, Idaho, July 11 (Reuters) - Liberty Media Corp  chairman and cable pioneer John Malone, whose offer to buy Time Warner Cable Inc was rejected by its management, sees Time Warner Cable as a buyer of other cable operators in an industry that needs to be consolidated. Cable companies need larger scale through consolidation, whether through mergers or joint ventures, the so-called “King of Cable” said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual Allen and Co media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. Malone’s Liberty Media, which has a 28 percent stake in cable operator Charter Communications, has been circling Time Warner Cable. Liberty also has a 1 percent investment in Time Warner Cable. “(Time Warner Cable) should be a consolidator because they’re the second biggest,” he said. Time Warner Cable, with roughly 12 million subscribers, is the No. 2 U.S. cable provider behind Comcast, which has more than 21 million video customers. Since the 72-year-old Malone jumped back into the U.S. market with Liberty Media’s investment in Charter earlier this year, analysts have predicted a wave of cable consolidation. The U.S. cable TV market faces rising programming costs as well as technology threats from upstarts such as Netflix, which offers movies and TV shows to subscribers online. Malone recently made an offer for Time Warner Cable, which was rejected by its management because they believe it is not beneficial to shareholders, Reuters has reported. When asked Thursday if he wants to buy Time Warner Cable, he answered only “that’s a tough question.” While Malone indicated Time Warner Cable could do its own deals, he left open the scenario that Charter could still buy the company. “Whether A merges with B, B buys A or A, B and C get together to do a joint ventures to do things that have to be done in larger scale, that’s really the message I’m trying to deliver,” he said without specifying which companies those letters represent. Companies have to get bigger to thrive, he said. Comcast is large enough to do OK. The rest of the industry needs consolidation, in our view, in order to get scale economics,” Malone said. In terms of the kind of deals Malone likes, he said that geographically “buying the guy next door makes the most sense,” referring to a decade-long push by larger companies to swap local cable systems with one another to create larger clusters. “Horizontal mergers are the safest, usually have the most synergies and are the easiest, but a lot of that has already been done in the industry. At this point you tend to look more for scale.” Time Warner Cable, which has long viewed Cablevision as an acquisition target because it makes sense geographically in the New York area, has reached out to smaller operators Cox and Cablevision about creating larger clusters in some of its main markets. “Obviously if you find you could buy the guy next door, that’s the best but those opportunities are somewhat limited,” Malone said.",7112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/sunvalley-conference-malone/libertys-malone-sees-deals-necessary-in-u-s-cable-market-idUSL1N0FH0L420130711

The Dow and the S&P; 500 pulled back from the record closing highs they hit on Thursday after the jobs report showed non-farm payrolls rose by 162,000 in July, below expectations, but the unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent, its lowest since December 2008. Coming off a series of better-than-expected data and optimism about strong growth in the second half of the year, the tepid jobs report was a reality check, analysts said. “Stock investors are scared of both the tapering and a potentially slowing economy,” said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. “They’re not sure what they’re scared of, but they know they’re scared. And very few people want to buy stocks at an all-time high.” Five of the 10 S&P; 500 industry sectors moved lower, led by losses of nearly 1 percent in the energy index. Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P; 500 after posting a steeper-than-expected 26 percent drop in quarterly profit. Shares of the company fell 2.3 percent to $123.55. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 17.38 points, or 0.11 percent, at 15,610.64. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 0.90 point, or 0.05 percent, at 1,705.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 3.18 points, or 0.09 percent, at 3,678.92. The tech-heavy index was boosted by gains of 5.9 percent in Viacomm, which reported an increase in its third-quarter revenue, and by a 0.7 percent uptick in Apple. On Thursday, the S&P; 500 posted its strongest day in three weeks and closed above the 1,700 level for the first time. Time Warner Cable fell 1.8 percent to $115.56 after Bloomberg reported that Cox Communications Inc has held talks about merging with cable provider and rival Charter Communications Inc.

50,CHTR,Exclusive: Charter weighs bid for Time Warner Cable by year-end -sources,"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc is weighing a bid for Time Warner Cable Inc before year-end and is trying to devise a deal structure that would lure the No. 2 U.S. cable operator’s shareholders, people familiar with the matter said. John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, which owns about a quarter of Charter, approached Time Warner Cable earlier this year about merging Charter and Time Warner Cable. Talks between the parties restarted over the past few days, according to a separate source close to matter, but Time Warner Cable’s management remains cool to the idea of a tie-up. Time Warner Cable, which earlier this week indicated that it was open to a deal at the right price, has a market value of more than $34 billion, compared with Charter’s market value of about $13 billion. Charter and Time Warner Cable declined to comment, while Liberty Media did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Cable billionaire Malone, who controls Liberty Media, has been talking up the need for consolidation in the cable industry, since he jumped backed into the U.S. cable market last spring. The U.S. cable TV market is mature and faces rising programming costs and the continued loss of video subscribers. Cable operators are also grappling with stiff competition from video services offered by satellite TV and phone companies, as well as internet-based services such as Netflix Inc. Charter is hoping that Time Warner Cable’s weak operating performance in the third quarter, in which it saw a fall in both TV and internet subscribers, would make the company more open to a bid, the sources said. Charter is working with its advisers on a deal structure which could add pressure on Time Warner Cable’s management to come to the negotiating table, the sources said. Time Warner Cable ranks second to Comcast Corp in the U.S. cable market with about 12 million customers, while Charter is the fourth-largest cable provider with about 4 million video customers. Time Warner Cable on a conference call on Thursday attributed the steep decline in customers to a month-long blackout of No. 1 U.S. broadcaster CBS Corp and said it was open to consolidation if it would make money for shareholders. But its outgoing chief executive, Glenn Britt, also said on the call that he has witnessed mergers that were lopsided for one set of shareholders, such as the disastrous AOL-Time Warner merger 13 years ago. Time Warner Cable has consistently underperformed other cable operators in recent quarters by losing hundreds of thousands of video subscribers and also seeing slowing growth in broadband customers. Shares of Time Warner Cable rose 3 percent on Thursday as takeover speculation overshadowed the company’s third-quarter results. The company’s shares closed up 2.8 percent at $123.51 on Friday following the report that Charter is weighing a bid. Charter shares closed up 3 percent on Friday at $138.07 in Nasdaq trading Charter will report third quarter earnings next week, but is not expected to reveal its plans of a deal, the sources said.

52,CHTR,Charter CFO says company in 'unique position' for a M&A; deal,"(Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc finance chief Chris Winfrey said on Tuesday he and Chief Executive Tom Rutledge have talked about potential mergers and acquisitions that would take advantage of the “unique position” the cable operator has because of its tax assets. Reuters reported last Friday that Charter (CHTR.O) was weighing a bid for Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N before the year end and is trying to devise a deal that would be attractive to the shareholders of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator. Winfrey told investors on a conference call following the company’s third quarter results that its tax assets, “put Charter in a pretty unique position to look at acquisitions, swaps ... and it can be a value accretive element of an M&A; strategy.” The remarks were made in response to a question about how Charter’s tax assets would work if Charter merged with a larger cable operator. Charter, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2009, has roughly $7.7 billion in net operating losses as of December 12, including $3.7 billion in net operating losses without restrictions, according to a Barclays research note dated July 30. Winfrey added that taxes were not the only reason to do M&A.; “Tom (Rutledge, Charter’s CEO)and I have both spoken extensively about that,” he said. “The reason to do M&A; is because you think you can grow things faster and make money that way.” Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan interpreted the comments on Tuesday as being, “entirely consistent with Charter having done a lot of thinking about how to do a deal.” Cable billionaire John Malone, who controls Liberty Media Corp LMCA.O, has been talking up the need for consolidation in the cable industry since he jumped backed into the U.S. cable market by buying about a quarter stake in Charter last spring.

It also noted that Comcast was seeking advice on concerns by U.S. antitrust regulators and the Federal Communications Commission about a potential tie-up. Comcast shareholders are encouraging management to consider a Time Warner Cable deal, these sources told CNBC. Charter Communications had approached Time Warner Cable about a tie-up last summer, but its overture was not received well by Time Warner Cable management who said the deal did not benefit shareholders.

Time Warner has around USD27bn of debt, according to Moody’s, which rates the company Baa2 with a stable outlook. Bondholders also have limited protection in the event of an acquisition, Moody’s warned. “This is particularly due to the absence of change-of-control protection,” Moody’s analyst Jessica Reiss said in the July report. “Instead bondholders must rely on the liens covenant for subordination, which prohibits liens on assets securing debt, except those on debt up the greater of 15% of the company’s consolidated net worth and USD500m.”",11222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/time-warner-cable-cds/time-warner-cable-cds-widens-on-buyout-talk-idUSL5N0J72HM20131122

63,CHTR,"Time Warner Cable, Charter execs see benefits of deals but in no rush","(Reuters) - Time Warner Cable’s incoming chief executive Rob Marcus said on Monday he is in no hurry to sell the company, while Charter’s CEO Tom Rutledge, a potential suitor, said the smaller company sees benefits in growing through acquisitions. Speaking at an investment conference hosted by the bank UBS, Marcus said his job as CEO will be to do what is best for shareholders. He said he would be open to selling the company only if a deal benefits investors. “Whether or not Time Warner Cable will participate in M&A; is and always has been, whether as a buyer or seller, 100 percent driven by what’s in the best interest of our shareholders,” Rutledge said. Time Warner Cable is the subject of takeover speculation and is being circled by suitors such as Charter Communications Inc, Comcast Corp and privately held Cox. Charter’s CEO Tom Rutledge said later at the UBS conference that Charter does not have to do an acquisition to grow, but there are major opportunities Charter can pursue once it reaches a larger scale. Charter has been speculated to become an industry consolidator since cable billionaire John Malone took a 27 percent stake in the company in the spring. If Charter was able to become larger through an acquisition, Charter would save on programming costs, could create a national advertising product, and expand its telecom services, Rutledge said. It might also develop Internet video streaming products, known as “over-the-top” services, he added. Rutledge did not comment directly on merger speculation regarding Time Warner Cable but did acknowledge that low interest rates create the best situation he’s “ever seen” to borrow large sums of money. Charter has a market value of about $13 billion, much less than Time Warner Cable’s $37 billion, and would need to raise a large amount of debt to finance a deal. Rutledge said his favorite acquisition targets are the ones that he can turn around, such the cable company Bresnan, which his company bought for $1.62 billion from Cablevision earlier this year. “The bigger opportunity in most M&A; that I’m interested in is the opportunity to operate and to unleash the full power of these networks, by unburdening them of analog signals, and standing up products that work the marketplace and growing the business,” Rutledge said. Charter is converting its analog video signals to digital which frees up bandwidth to provide other services such as broadband Internet. Time Warner Cable’s networks are not all digital yet, while Comcast has made the full transition to digital. While Time Warner Cable’s Marcus refrained from discussing the takeover speculation at length at the conference, he did say in a question-and-answer session there would be general benefits to consolidation in cable, such as eliminating overhead and reducing programming and infrastructure costs. Marcus said he is “committed to fixing” the company’s residential business, which has suffered major declines over the past few years, while also expanding the business services unit. He forecast business services would grow to $5 billion in revenue over the next four to five years. He said the recent hiring of Dinni Jain as chief operating officer was an example of an improvement to Time Warner Cable’s management team. Jain was a top executive at Insight Communications when Time Warner Cable acquired that company last year. He takes up his new post on January 13. Marcus is currently Time Warner Cable COO and president and takes over as CEO on January 1. Reuters reported on Friday that Comcast, the No. 1 U.S. cable provider, has tapped JPMorgan Chase & Co for advice as it evaluates a potential bid for Time Warner Cable, the industry No. 2. Comcast does not plan to make a pre-emptive bid for the company but could jump in if signs emerge that much smaller rival Charter, which has been pursuing Time Warner Cable for months, is getting close to a deal, sources have said.

Time Warner Cable is the subject of takeover speculation and is being circled by suitors such as Charter Communications Inc , Comcast Corp and privately held Cox. Charter’s CEO Tom Rutledge said later at the UBS conference that Charter does not have to do an acquisition to grow, but there are major opportunities Charter can pursue once it reaches a larger scale. Charter has been speculated to become an industry consolidator since cable billionaire John Malone took a 27 percent stake in the company in the spring. If Charter was able to become larger through an acquisition, Charter would save on programming costs, could create a national advertising product, and expand its telecom services, Rutledge said. It might also develop Internet video streaming products, known as “over-the-top” services, he added. Rutledge did not comment directly on merger speculation regarding Time Warner Cable but did acknowledge that low interest rates create the best situation he’s “ever seen” to borrow large sums of money. Charter has a market value of about $13 billion, much less than Time Warner Cable’s $37 billion, and would need to raise a large amount of debt to finance a deal. Rutledge said his favorite acquisition targets are the ones that he can turn around, such the cable company Bresnan, which his company bought for $1.62 billion from Cablevision earlier this year. “The bigger opportunity in most M&A; that I’m interested in is the opportunity to operate and to unleash the full power of these networks, by unburdening them of analog signals, and standing up products that work the marketplace and growing the business,” Rutledge said. Charter is converting its analog video signals to digital which frees up bandwidth to provide other services such as broadband Internet. Time Warner Cable’s networks are not all digital yet, while Comcast has made the full transition to digital. While Time Warner Cable’s Marcus refrained from discussing the takeover speculation at length at the conference, he did say in a question-and-answer session there would be general benefits to consolidation in cable, such as eliminating overhead and reducing programming and infrastructure costs. Marcus said he is “committed to fixing” the company’s residential business, which has suffered major declines over the past few years, while also expanding the business services unit. He forecast business services would grow to $5 billion in revenue over the next four to five years. He said the recent hiring of Dinni Jain as chief operating officer was an example of an improvement to Time Warner Cable’s management team.

68,CHTR,Charter readies Time Warner Cable bid below $135 per share: source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc is preparing to send an offer letter to acquire Time Warner Cable Inc as soon as next week, a source close to the matter said on Friday. The offer is expected to be less than $135 per Time Warner Cable share and will be a combination of cash and stock, said the source, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. A Charter spokesman declined to comment, while a Time Warner Cable spokeswoman also declined to comment. Time Warner Cable shares barely budged Friday afternoon, closing 35 cents higher, or 0.2 percent, at $131.40. Any bidder for Time Warner Cable would likely need to offer at least $150 per share to be considered seriously by the board, one person familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. Barclays credit analysts said the lower bid price reported on Friday, “could extend the process, potentially leading to either negotiations on deal terms or to a proxy process should Time Warner Cable reject the overture.” Event-driven investors have piled into the stock since reports emerged that Time Warner Cable was a takeover target. Filings show Paulson & Co owned 1.4 percent of Time Warner Cable shares as of September 30, while the hedge fund Corvex Management owned 0.06 percent as of that date. The Barclays note said that nominations for Time Warner Cable’s board begin on January 15, “so a bid submission prior to this makes sense.” Charter is much smaller than Time Warner Cable, but has been trying to line up financing from several banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Bank of America Corp and Deutsche Bank AG, to swing the transaction, sources said.

Equities are coming off their worst week in nearly four months, a pullback that came on concerns the Fed may begin a stimulus wind-down at its two-day policy-setting meeting that ends Wednesday. The stimulus has been a major contributor to the market’s gains this year, and has been expected to keep a floor under stock prices for as long as it continues. Investors have been trying to gauge the timing of when the central bank will start winding down its market-friendly bond purchases, with many market participants expecting the Fed to announce a tapering in March. However, stronger economic data of late, including the November payroll report, has led some to believe the tapering could come earlier, as soon as at the Fed’s meeting this week. The Fed has said it will slow the program when certain economic indicators meet its growth targets. “The market’s direction has been biased towards the upside, and there’s some relief from last week’s selling pressure,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “I was expecting hesitation going into the Fed, but I think most accept that while it is possible we’ll see some kind of change in policy, it is unlikely.” Avago Technologies Ltd agreed to buy LSI Corp  for $6.6 billion, while American International Group Inc  said it would sell its aircraft-leasing business to AerCap Holdings NV in a deal valued at about $5.4 billion. AerCap shares surged 32 percent to $33.01 in premarket trading while AIG rose 2.3 percent to $50.86. S&P; 500 futures rose 9.1 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 93 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 14.75 points. The S&P; 500 fell below its 14-day moving average on Wednesday and has not closed above it since, a sign of weak near-term momentum. However, the benchmark index is less than 2 percent above its record closing high, indicating that recent selling has not been panic-driven. In other company news, a source close to the matter told Reuters that Charter Communications Inc was preparing to send an offer letter to acquire Time Warner Cable Inc  for less than $135 a share. Time Warner closed Friday at $131.40. Twitter Inc fell 1.2 percent in premarket trading after both Wells Fargo and Suntrust downgraded the social media stock. Procter & Gamble plans to reorganize its overseas business as part of Chief Executive A.G. Lafley’s plans to cut costs, according to a Bloomberg report that cited three unidentified people briefed on the matter. Wall Street closed flat on Friday, but all three major indexes fell more than 1.5 percent last week, the largest weekly percentage drop since August.

74,CHTR,EXCLUSIVE-Comcast weighs three options for Time Warner Cable deal-sources,"(Adds details on the cable companies, shareholder meeting) By Liana B. Baker, Soyoung Kim and Nicola Leske NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp is examining three scenarios for a potential deal with Time Warner Cable, including a full takeover bid for the second-largest cable operator, people close to the situation said on Monday. Top cable provider Comcast is also considering whether it could buy some selective Time Warner Cable markets, or team up with another cable company besides Charter Communications Inc  to bid for all of Time Warner Cable, the people said. Besides Comcast and Charter, privately held Cox Communications Inc also has interest in a potential deal involving Time Warner Cable, people familiar with the matter have previously said. Comcast, which has a market capitalization of roughly $127 billion, could ultimately decide not to do any deal, said the people, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with media organizations. A full takeover of Time Warner Cable makes sense because the company has geographic markets complementary to Comcast, while taking on a partner would give them opportunity to pick and choose key markets, one of the people said. Analysts say buying all of Time Warner Cable would also face tough regulatory scrutiny. Comcast is weighing all three options equally at this point and would wait to see what kind of offer Charter come up with before pursuing any one of the options, the person added. Comcast is being advised by JPMorgan Chase & Co on a potential deal for Time Warner Cable, Reuters previously reported. Representatives for Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Cox declined to comment. Charter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The potential entry of Comcast into a still-developing bidding war could complicate months-long efforts by Charter and its largest shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, to acquire Time Warner Cable. Charter, the No. 4 cable player in which John Malone’s Liberty Media owns a 27 percent stake, is preparing to send an offer letter for Time Warner Cable as soon as this week, valuing the larger rival at below $135 per share, Reuters reported on Friday. But it remains unclear whether the expected bid from Charter, which would provide little premium to Time Warner Cable’s current trading prices, would gain traction with the larger rival’s shareholders or its management. Shares of Time Warner Cable ended 0.5 percent higher at $132.09 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Any bid would need to be at least $150 per share to be considered seriously by the company’s board, a person familiar with the company’s thinking previously said. John Malone and Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s chief executive, met with some of Time Warner Cable’s largest shareholders in Denver last week and pitched the merits of a combination with Charter, other people familiar with the matter said. Some of the shareholders, however, told the executives that they would not entertain a deal without a substantial premium, those people said.

The stimulus has been a major contributor to the market’s gains this year, and has been expected to keep a floor under stock prices for as long as it continues. Investors have been trying to gauge the timing of when the central bank will start winding down its market-friendly bond purchases, with many market participants expecting the Fed to announce a tapering in March. However, stronger economic data of late, including the November payroll report, has led some to believe the tapering will come earlier, as soon as at the Fed’s meeting this week. The Fed has said it will slow the program when certain economic indicators meet its growth targets. “Payrolls solidified the perception that the end of stimulus is near,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC  in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “While I don’t expect any Fed changes this month, most investors are hesitating ahead of the meeting. I don’t think we’ll see major commitments on either side of the market until then.” A read on New York manufacturing is among the data on tap for Monday, with the report scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT). Manufacturing is seen rebounding in December. November industrial output and capacity utilization data are also on tap. Overseas, European shares rose 0.7 percent after Markit’s Flash Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index ended 2013 at its highest level of the year. S&P; 500 futures were flat but remained above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 38 points and Nasdaq 100 futures were flat. The S&P; 500 fell below its 14-day moving average on Wednesday and has not closed above it since, a sign of weak near-term momentum. However, the benchmark index is less than 2 percent above its record closing high, indicating that recent selling has not been panic-driven. In company news, a source close to the matter told Reuters that Charter Communications Inc was preparing to send an offer letter to acquire Time Warner Cable Inc for less than $135 a share.

77,CHTR,Exclusive: Liberty sees $700 million Charter-Time Warner Cable synergies - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Liberty Media Corp’s top executives estimate that a merger between Charter Communications Inc and Time Warner Cable Inc could generate roughly $700 million in annual synergies, according to people close to the matter. Liberty Chairman John Malone, who wants to use his 27 percent ownership in Charter to consolidate the cable industry, discussed the estimate when he, along with Chief Executive Greg Maffei, met with large Time Warner Cable shareholders in Denver last week, the people said. Synergies from capital spending reductions, lower annual programming costs and other cuts in operating expenses are a key consideration for Time Warner Cable shareholders, as any takeover offer from Charter would include a large amount of its own stock. However, Time Warner Cable, the subject of a months-long pursuit by Liberty and Charter, thinks any synergies from a merger would be much lower, at close to $500 million, other people familiar with the matter said. The timing of Charter’s expected cash and stock bid remains unclear, but it may be pushed into the new year given the upcoming holidays, people familiar with the matter said. Charter had been preparing to send an offer letter as soon as this week, valuing the larger cable operator at below $135 per share, Reuters and others previously reported. All the people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Representatives for Liberty, Charter and Time Warner Cable declined to comment. Besides Charter, top cable operator Comcast Corp and No.3 player Cox Communications Inc are also evaluating options for a potential deal with Time Warner Cable, people familiar with the matter have said. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts met with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler on Thursday, the company’s spokeswoman said. This is one of many meetings between Wheeler and various industry executives since he became the top U.S. communications regulator in November. A person familiar with the matter said the two did not discuss possible deals or transactions. Antitrust experts have warned that a takeover of the No. 2 cable operator by the industry’s largest company would run into major obstacles with the FCC and the Justice Department. Charter, the No.4 cable operator, has a market capitalization of around $13.6 billion, much smaller than Time Warner Cable’s nearly $38 billion market value. Depending on the cash and stock split of a deal, Time Warner Cable shareholders would end up with much of the combined company’s equity, making the synergies a crucial element that would help them determine if a deal is attractive. Craig Moffett, a research analyst at MoffettNathanson, estimated that synergies from a Charter-Time Warner Cable merger would total around $450 million annually — far smaller than Liberty’s own estimate. “The synergies between the two, aside from programming expense, would likely be modest at best,” Moffett said in a research note. “Even the fully realized programming savings are probably less than what most think.” He said the vast majority of the synergies would come from some $370 million in annual programming savings, but cautioned that getting bigger would not necessarily help the combined company receive better programming rates from media companies than Time Warner Cable already gets. Barclays, meanwhile, recently estimated around $560 million of synergies from a transaction, mainly by lowering Charter’s programming costs in line with that of Time Warner Cable. However, one Time Warner Cable shareholder, who asked not to be named, said that there could be additional value from a merger with Charter, led by well-regarded cable executive Tom Rutledge, whose long career encompassed stints at Time Warner Cable and Cablevision Systems Corp. “A lot of value will be created if one - there’s synergies and two - you have the best operating executive in the mix. Tom Rutledge has done an excellent job,” said the shareholder, who attended the meeting with Liberty.

78,CHTR,"Nader slams Malone's 'lowball' Sirius bid, suggests Icahn step in","Jan 6 (Reuters) - Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said Liberty Media Corp Chairman John Malone’s offer to buy out the remaining stake in satellite radio company Sirius XM  was “ludicrous” and called for activist investor Carl Icahn to take notice. Nader, a Sirius shareholder, said on Monday that Liberty’s $3.68-a-share bid was below the $4 where the company was trading a few weeks ago. Shares of Sirius climbed 6.5 percent to $3.80 in morning trading. “I am sure that I along with other shareholders in Sirius XM will be interested in a legal challenge to John Malone’s company for lowballing Sirius XM’s shareholder value,” Nader said in a statement. “Carl Icahn - take notice and interest.” It was not immediately clear how many Sirius shares Nader owns. Nor was it clear whether Icahn is a shareholder of the company, although he is known to take an active role at corporations in which he owns stakes, such as Apple Inc . A spokeswoman for Liberty Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Liberty Media, which owns a majority stake in Sirius, launched a buyout offer to the company’s minority shareholders on Friday. The timing raised eyebrows since Liberty is also in pursuit of Time Warner Cable Inc. Taking full control of Sirius, which is expected to generate $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization this year, gives  Liberty the financial flexibility for other deals, its executives said. Liberty owns a large stake in cable company Charter Communications Inc. Meanwhile, Sirius’ rival online streaming music service, Pandora Media Inc, said the number of active listeners rose 13 percent to 76.2 million in December. Shares of Pandora rose almost 10 percent to $30.30.

79,CHTR,Charter offers to buy Time Warner Cable in public appeal to shareholders,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc formally offered on Monday to acquire larger rival Time Warner Cable for $37.3 billion, signaling the start of what is likely to be a contentious battle for control of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator. Charter, the No. 4 cable operator, proposed paying $132.50 per share - barely higher than where Time Warner Cable shares closed on Monday - consisting of around $83 per share in cash and its own stock. Monday’s offer is the boldest sign yet that cable billionaire and dealmaker John Malone thinks that new managers could do a better job running the company, which has fallen behind and underinvested in taking on competitors and on digital technology. Including debt, the deal is worth $62.35 billion. Time Warner Cable shareholders would get 45 percent ownership in the combined company. Charter said on Monday that it held discussions with Time Warner Cable, which is led by Chief Executive Officer Rob Marcus, but the company wanted a higher bid and talks have not been constructive. Charter now plans to take the deal directly to Time Warner Cable shareholders. “They came back to us with a design to be dismissive. They have not engaged with us. All of the conversations have been one way,” Charter’s CEO Tom Rutledge said in an interview. Rutledge, who spent 23 years at Time Warner Cable earlier in his career, told Reuters he could run the company better and pointed to how Time Warner Cable has lost about 500,000 video subscribers in the past two quarters. He said Time Warner Cable shareholders should be happy with the $83 per share cash component of the deal, since it is at the same level as the stock price before the takeover speculation began six months ago. “The purpose of going to the public is to talk to Time Warner shareholders and to ask them to consider how valuable this deal is and to ask management and the board to engaged,” he said. Rutledge admitted that a hostile offer in the friendly cable industry where companies do not directly compete with each other is “unusual” but he said Monday’s letter was necessary because talks have not progressed over the past six months. He said financing was in place and banks could sign commitment letters “in a matter of days.” “Putting Charter and Time Warner Cable together makes it a premier asset,” Rutledge said. Charter stock was up 1.3 percent in after-hours trading while Time Warner Cable shares were up 1.8 percent at $135. Rutledge declined to give an estimate on potential cost savings from a deal but said they were “significant” and they had told Time Warner Cable what they were. Reuters has previously reported that Liberty management had told investors that synergies could be as high as $700 million. Rutledge said Malone’s Liberty Media Corp wants to retain its 25 percent ownership stake in Charter and has the option to invest equity in the deal. He said the exact amount was being worked out. Time Warner Cable was not immediately available for comment. Rutledge said he was not in talks with Comcast to get the No. 1 provider involved in the bidding process. “This is Charter bidding for Time Warner. That’s the only discussion we have going,” he said. Charter said that it had made repeated overtures to Time Warner Cable for more than six months but that the response led Charter to determine that there was no intent to engage in a merger. Charter said in a letter to Time Warner Cable that the company had unrealistic price expectations. The smaller rival said it remained open to all options but that it was fully prepared to finalize a deal on an expedited basis. Time Warner has become one of the industry’s weakest performers. Leichtman Research Group estimates that over the past two years, the company lagged rivals by losing nearly 10 percent of nearly 13 million video customers. Charter said Goldman Sachs and Liontree Advisors were lead advisers. Guggenheim Securities was also a financial adviser to Charter. BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc are also financial advisers to Charter, and together with Goldman Sachs, are leading the financing for the transaction.

83,CHTR,Charter touts benefits of offer for Time Warner Cable,"(Reuters) - Charter Communications expects annual synergies of $500 million and other benefits such as tax savings from its proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable, the company said in an investor presentation posted on its website Tuesday. The No. 4 cable operator is trying to strike a deal to buy Time Warner Cable and sway its shareholders after three of its offers have been rebuffed. On Monday, Charter took its approach public and proposed paying $132.50 per share, consisting of around $83 per share in cash and its own stock, in a deal valued at $37.3 billion that Time Warner Cable’s board rejected. Annual synergies from a deal would grow to $750 million from $500 million over time, Charter said. The combined company would have to take on $20.5 billion in new debt, or $72.16 per share, which would bring it to a leverage ratio of 4.8 times to five times. The combined company may also have to do “swaps and divestitures” to make the regions it serves more efficient, according to one of the slides in the presentation. Some analysts have said that No. 1 cable provider Comcast would be interested in some of Time Warner Cable’s markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. Charter also said it was aiming to secure committed bridge financing of $3.5 billion and would have to pay $600 million in fees, interest and expenses. Charter explained in its 30-page presentation how it would accelerate Time Warner Cable’s customer and cash-flow growth, increase its margins and roll out higher Internet speeds. Time Warner Cable did not have an immediate response. Charter, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, said it can use its tax assets, about $7.8 billion in loss carry forwards to reduce a merged company’s operating earnings and tax payments. These credits would transfer to the combined company, it said in its presentation to investors, “and should do so without additional restrictions, allowing NewCo to use Charter’s loss carry forwards against Charter’s and TWC’s combined taxable income.” It argued that Time Warner Cable share price would decline without a deal. Time Warner Cable shares have risen from the $90s to the $130s since takeover speculation began six months ago and were trading 3 percent higher on Tuesday at $136.29 per share. “Absent a serious M&A; alternative, TWC faces significant potential share price downside,” Charter said. The company ended the presentation saying that it’s “time for shareholders to weigh in if they prefer a combination with Charter.” Charter will discuss its presentation it posted and take analysts’ questions on a conference call later on Tuesday.

84,CHTR,Charter takes rejected Time Warner Cable bid to investors,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc on Monday formally offered to acquire larger rival Time Warner Cable for $37.3 billion, sparking what is likely to be a contentious battle for control of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator. Charter, the No. 4 cable operator, proposed paying $132.50 per share - barely higher than where Time Warner Cable shares closed on Monday - consisting of around $83 per share in cash and its own stock. Monday’s offer is the boldest sign yet that cable billionaire and dealmaker John Malone thinks that new managers could do a better job running the company, which has fallen behind by not investing enough in taking on competitors and shifting to digital technology. Malone’s Liberty Media Corp owns 27 percent of Charter. Including debt, the deal is worth $62.35 billion. Time Warner Cable shareholders would get 45 percent ownership in the combined company. The letter was Charter’s third attempt to buy the company, according to its executives, and within a few hours of receiving it, Time Warner Cable’s board rejected the offer as “grossly inadequate.” “In essence, these guys are just trying to get a premium asset at a bargain basement price,” said Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Officer Rob Marcus in an interview. “This makes the job of fending it off rather straightforward. Our shareholders will see it as what it is, an attempt to steal the company.” Marcus, who took over the top post on January 1 after eight years, said the board told Charter it was open to a price of $160 per share, consisting of $100 in cash and $60 per share of Charter’s stock. Charter now plans to take the deal directly to Time Warner Cable shareholders, said Charter’s CEO Tom Rutledge in an interview. “(Time Warner Cable) came back to us with a design to be dismissive. They have not engaged with us. All of the conversations have been one way,” Rutledge said. Rutledge, who spent 23 years at Time Warner Cable earlier in his career, told Reuters he could run the company better and pointed to how Time Warner Cable shed more than 500,000 video subscribers in the past two quarters. Rutledge said Time Warner Cable shareholders should be happy with the $83 per share cash component of the deal, since it is not that far off the stock price before the takeover speculation began six months ago. “The purpose of going to the public is to talk to Time Warner shareholders and to ask them to consider how valuable this deal is and to ask management and the board to engage,” he said. He added that a proxy contest in which Time Warner Cable shareholders could vote in new directors friendly to a Charter bid was a possibility. The season for naming such rival board slates starts this week. Time Warner Cable’s Chief Financial Officer Arthur Minson said he doubted Charter could launch a viable proxy fight. “Essentially what you’d have to do is try to get new board members who would have to breach their fiduciary duty by trying to sell the company to Charter cheaply,” Minson said. Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said she expects Charter to raise its bid. “This is just the opening round of the negotiations,” Yong said. “This was Charter sending notice that they won’t overpay.” Charter CEO Rutledge wouldn’t comment on whether the company would consider a higher offer, and said the company would be disciplined about raising the bid. The letter was necessary, he said, because talks with the board had not progressed in the past six months. A hostile move is unusual, he admitted, in the clubby cable industry, where companies do not directly compete with each other. Rutledge said Charter had financing was in place and banks could sign commitment letters “in a matter of days.” Charter stock was up 1.3 percent in after-hours trading while Time Warner Cable shares were up 1.8 percent at $135. ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said that “we think an ultimate consolidation of the two companies would be beneficial for both sets of shareholders.” Rutledge declined to give an estimate on potential cost savings from a deal but said they were “significant” and his company had told Time Warner Cable what they were. Reuters has previously reported that Liberty management had told investors that synergies could be as high as $700 million. Liberty Media, Charter’s largest stockholder, has the option to invest more equity in the company and wants to maintain its current 27 percent stake in the company. In a statement, a Liberty spokeswoman said, “We support Charter’s efforts and look forward to participating.” Rutledge said he was not in talks with Comcast Corp to get the No. 1 U.S. cable provider involved in the bidding process. Marcus at Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Comcast. “This is Charter bidding for Time Warner. That’s the only discussion we have going,” he said. Comcast, which has been seen as a candidate to bid alone or jointly for Time Warner Cable, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Time Warner has become one of the industry’s weakest performers. Leichtman Research Group estimates that over the past two years, the company lagged rivals by losing nearly 10 percent of nearly 13 million video customers. Minson, the finance chief, said Time Warner Cable would increase its capital investment this year to improve the company’s product and reliability.

86,CHTR,UPDATE 1-Charter touts benefits of offer for Time Warner Cable,"By Liana B. Baker Jan 14 (Reuters) - Charter Communications expects annual synergies of $500 million and other benefits such as tax savings from its proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable , the company said in an investor presentation posted on its website Tuesday. The No. 4 cable operator is trying to strike a deal to buy Time Warner Cable and sway its shareholders after three of its offers have been rebuffed. On Monday, Charter took its approach public and proposed paying $132.50 per share, consisting of around $83 per share in cash and its own stock, in a deal valued at $37.3 billion that Time Warner Cable’s board rejected. Annual synergies from a deal would grow to $750 million from $500 million over time, Charter said. The combined company would have to take on $20.5 billion in new debt, or $72.16 per share, which would bring it to a leverage ratio of 4.8 times to five times. The combined company may also have to do “swaps and divestitures” to make the regions it serves more efficient, according to one of the slides in the presentation. Some analysts have said that No. 1 cable provider Comcast would be interested in some of Time Warner Cable’s markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. Charter also said it was aiming to secure committed bridge financing of $3.5 billion and would have to pay $600 million in fees, interest and expenses. Charter explained in its 30-page presentation how it would accelerate Time Warner Cable’s customer and cash-flow growth, increase its margins and roll out higher Internet speeds. Time Warner Cable did not have an immediate response. Charter, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, said it can use its tax assets, about $7.8 billion in loss carry forwards to reduce a merged company’s operating earnings and tax payments. These credits would transfer to the combined company, it said in its presentation to investors, “and should do so without additional restrictions, allowing NewCo to use Charter’s loss carry forwards against Charter’s and TWC’s combined taxable income.” It argued that Time Warner Cable share price would decline without a deal. Time Warner Cable shares have risen from the $90s to the $130s since takeover speculation began six months ago and were trading 3 percent higher on Tuesday at $136.29 per share. “Absent a serious M&A; alternative, TWC faces significant potential share price downside,” Charter said.

89,CHTR,Time Warner Cable shares top Charter Communications' offer price,"Jan 14 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc shares rose above the price of $132.50 per share offered on Monday by smaller rival Charter Communications Inc, a deal that was swiftly rejected by the No. 2 U.S. cable TV operator. Time Warner Cable’s shares were up 3 percent at $136.40 on Tuesday morning, suggesting some investors expect a higher bid. Calling the bid “grossly inadequate,” Time Warner Cable rejected the $37.3 billion offer, the third attempt by Charter to acquire the company. Analysts said Time Warner Cable’s demand of $160 per share was reasonable and Charter could raise its bid. “...We believe something in the neighborhood of 10 percent near-term upside (for Time Warner) if an agreement at TWC’s asking price of $160 were to be announced is reasonable,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher King said in a note. Charter’s Chief Executive Tom Rutledge said the company now planned to take the deal directly to Time Warner Cable shareholders. Charter proposed to pay around $83 per share in cash and the rest in its own stock. Including debt, the deal is worth about $62.35 billion. Charter shares were up about 1 percent at $135.38 on the Nasdaq.

Baker NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - A number of Time Warner Cable  shareholders would support a merger with Charter Communications Inc if Charter raises its current bid for the larger rival to $41 billion or more, according to people close to the matter. Charter on Monday formally offered to buy Time Warner Cable for $132.50 a share, or $37.3 billion, based on shares outstanding. Time Warner Cable’s board swiftly rejected that bid as “grossly inadequate” and said it was open to a sale at $160 per share. Several large shareholders, including at least two of the company’s top 10 investors, would back a sale to Charter in the $145 to $150 per share range - or roughly $41 billion to $42  billion - the people said on Wednesday. The shareholders told Charter and Time Warner Cable that they would not accept Charter’s current offer, said the people close to the matter, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media. “(Time Warner Cable) has had a dialogue with the top holders. It’s just a matter of price and $132.50 won’t get it done,” said one Time Warner Cable shareholder who asked not to be identified. A Time Warner Cable spokeswoman said in a statement “our shareholders are confirming our position that the Charter proposal is grossly inadequate.” A Charter spokesman declined to comment. The price Time Warner Cable shareholders would seek also depends on how much cash Charter would be willing to pay. It has offered $82.54 a share in cash and the rest in its own stock - a proposal that would give Time Warner Cable shareholders 45 percent ownership of the combined company. Time Warner Cable has said it wants more cash and less  Charter stock, and made a counterproposal - a Charter bid of $160 per share consisting of $100 per share in cash and the remainder in stock. “Composition will count for much. A higher cash component could save Charter a few dollars in shareholders’ eyes, especially given that there are uncertainties about the synergy level,” said Steve Soranno, an equity analyst at Calvert Investment Management, which has $13 billion under management and owns Time Warner Cable shares. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, estimates synergies of $500 million in the first year as a combined company with growth to $750 million over time, the company said on Tuesday. That figure came down from those Charter first communicated to Time Warner Cable when it made its initial proposal in July. Charter then told the larger rival that a combination would generate $650 million of synergies in the first year increasing to $1 billion over time, according to a person close to the matter. Its chief executive, Tom Rutledge, said on an investor call on Tuesday that his $500 million-$750 million synergies estimate is conservative. “I am very comfortable that we can deliver more than $750 million of run rate synergies over time,” Rutledge said. Analysts, however, cautioned that savings would likely fall short because getting bigger would not necessarily help the combined company receive better programming rates from media companies than Time Warner Cable already gets. Synergies from capital spending reductions, lower annual programming costs and other cuts in operating expenses are a key consideration for Time Warner Cable shareholders, as they would end up with a large proportion of the merged company’s equity under the current proposal. Charter has been attempting to buy Time Warner Cable for six months, but talks have not progressed, prompting Charter to appeal directly to shareholders. Charter’s executives were in Boston on Wednesday meeting with Time Warner Cable investors as part of a roadshow.

Charter’s top executives slammed Time Warner Cable for having the industry’s lowest customer satisfaction and “negative momentum.” Charter argues that Time Warner Cable is better off in its hands because its management can spearhead a turnaround of its larger rival. Executives from the No. 4 cable operator made these comments on a conference call a day after it launched a bid for Time Warner Cable at $132.50 per share, consisting of around $83 per share in cash and its own stock.

While executives at Charter and its largest shareholder Liberty Media Corp have said before that they could do a better job running the No. 2 cable provider, they saved their harshest criticism to date for Tuesday’s call. “This negative momentum isn’t simply result of an operating plan over the last year, it is the failed plan over the past half decade,” said Charter’s Chief Operating Officer John Bickham. While he argued that Time Warner Cable has fallen behind by not investing enough in taking on competitors and shifting to digital technology, Charter has also struggled in recent years. It emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 and is in the midst of a turnaround under new management. While customers from all cable companies complain about their service, Time Warner Cable is dead last in customer satisfaction surveys in three of the country’s four regions, according to J.D. Power. In the fourth region, the West, it ranks seventh of nine subscription TV providers surveyed. Still, Charter does not fare much better and ranks second to last in three of the four regions. In response to Charter’s comment, Time Warner Cable released a statement saying, “We are confident in our standalone plan and we are not going to let Charter steal the company.” It also noted that Charter itself had referred to Time Warner Cable as “the biggest and best M&A; option available.” Reuters and other outlets have previously reported that No. 1 cable provider Comcast Corp was weighing a bid, but Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge added on the call that he is not aware of any other bidder pursuing Time Warner Cable. Charter released a presentation earlier in the day saying that it expects annual synergies of $500 million and other benefits such as tax savings from its proposed acquisition. Annual synergies from a deal would grow to $750 million from $500 million over time, Charter said.

97,CHTR,Analysis: Time Warner Cable customers may not see quick fix from merger,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc, as it campaigns to win over investors in its bid to acquire Time Warner Cable, has suggested that a change in control could be a godsend to the often-disgruntled customers of Time Warner Cable. But if Charter is successful in its bid, customers of Time Warner Cable, the No. 2 U.S. cable provider, who complain about Internet speeds and video may not see improvements anytime soon. And if they’re hoping that their bills will be smaller, they may be disappointed. Charter’s track record has been on the upswing since Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge took over in February 2012 after leaving Cablevision. Rutledge, who spent two decades at Time Warner Cable, has vowed to “improve Time Warner Cable customer satisfaction through quality operations, which results in longer average subscriber life.” The problem is that Charter’s customer satisfaction scores are not much better than Time Warner Cable’s. Charter noted on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday that Time Warner Cable had the lowest customer satisfaction scores, but it neglected to mention that Charter ranks second to last in three of the four regions for video. Time Warner Cable actually has a better score than Charter in the western United States, according to ratings firm J.D. Power. Customer service scores aside, it’s far from a sure thing that any new owner - Reuters reported on Wednesday that Charter was in talks with Comcast about splitting some assets - might make customers happier, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. “Cable companies are not exactly known for their customer service no matter what the brand masthead says,” Greenfield said. SNL Kagan analyst Ian Olgeirson said Charter has simplified pricing packages that don’t give consumers a laundry list of options, which could help Time Warner Cable. But in terms of Internet speeds or video service, he sees most companies as similar. Charter said its top tier Internet service is 100 megs in all markets. For Time Warner Cable, this speed is available in some but not all markets, such as Los Angeles and soon New York. Time Warner Cable plans to boost speeds in its top markets to 300 megs this year. Still, Olgeirson said Charter’s pitch has some validity. “Time Warner Cable is generally perceived to be moving in a downward direction over the last couple of years whereas Charter is generally perceived to be moving in a slightly upward direction,” he said. It’s also true that Charter started from a low bar. Emerging from bankruptcy in 2009, Charter’s market share is low compared to rivals and it suffered from under-investment for years, according to MoffettNathanson Research analyst Craig Moffett. On the cost side for consumers, a combination of the companies could even accelerate changes that would raise prices. Executives of Liberty Media, Charter’s largest shareholder with a 27 percent stake, have spoken out in favor of usage-based Internet pricing, a practice that could result in higher prices for heavy Internet users. Such a plan could easily be rolled out across Time Warner Cable’s markets after an acquisition, especially given that since 2012 Time Warner Cable has offered an Internet pricing option on a metered basis. Over the long run, Liberty Media Chairman John Malone could pressure the combined company to adopt this model further or raise Internet prices, Moffett said. “John Malone seems to have a more aggressive strategy to move the industry towards usage-based pricing. Armed with Time Warner Cable, that would happen sooner rather than later,” Moffett said. Charter has said it is committed to upgrading Time Warner Cable’s service, something that would be supported by the increased capital investment that Charter said is a top priority. Time Warner Cable has also said it would invest more capital into the business this year. Charter has said it plans to improve Time Warner Cable’s Internet speeds and video service by converting it to an all-digital signal, which allows more advanced features, including faster broadband Internet speeds. Time Warner Cable has moved slowly to roll out digital technology. It is currently converting its markets and is already digital in New York. Charter is planning to go all digital by the end of the year. As for Charter’s proposed changes, Moffett said, “It’s not clear that Rob Marcus won’t do the same thing now that he’s the CEO,” referring to Time Warner Cable’s chief who took over January 1. If Charter does increase its capital investment, Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said it could “be very good for the customer in the long term,” but in the short term he doesn’t foresee much change. Customers also aren’t sure which company would be better. Charter customer John-Paul Hunt said he pays about $50 a month for Internet service in Woodsville, New Hampshire, which he said is reliable and fast. The 33-year-old IT consultant doesn’t pay for TV service because he can’t stand commercials. Up until August, he used Time Warner Cable in a neighboring town at his girlfriend’s house, which he said also had good service. “I don’t know which is better, but I do like the idea of having more than one cable company floating around,” Hunt said.

99,CHTR,"Exclusive: Charter, Comcast in renewed talks on Time Warner Cable bid","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc reached out to Comcast Corp this week about teaming up to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, after the larger rival rejected its $37.3 billion takeover bid, according to people familiar with the matter. Charter approached Comcast on Wednesday to discuss carving up the second-largest U.S. cable company’s systems and subscribers, the people said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Charter, the No. 4 U.S. cable provider, and Comcast, the top U.S. cable provider, are in preliminary discussions about how to structure a potential alliance, the people said. One possibility is that Charter buys all of Time Warner Cable and sells off some of its markets and subscribers to Comcast, one of the people said. It was not immediately clear which geographic markets are under discussion, but analysts have said that Comcast would be interested in Time Warner Cable’s largest markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. The two companies held similar discussions late last year but those talks did not progress at that time. Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter declined to comment. A successful tie-up would take out Comcast from the bidding for Time Warner Cable. Comcast, which has also evaluated a takeover bid for all of Time Warner Cable, was seen as the only likely suitor besides Charter. Analysts have said any attempt to merge the two largest cable operators, however, would face tough scrutiny from U.S. regulators. Securing backing from Comcast could also allow Charter, with a market capitalization of around $14 billion, to pay more for Time Warner Cable, which has a much larger market value of $38 billion. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, formally announced its $132.50 per share bid for Time Warner Cable on Monday, which the larger rival promptly rejected as too low. Time Warner Cable instead made a counter proposal worth $160 per share, including $100 in cash and the rest in stock. A number of large Time Warner Cable shareholders would support a deal with Charter if the company sweetens its bid to $145 to $150 per share, Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday. Charter has said the combined company may have to do “swaps and divestitures” of cable systems to serve regions more efficiently, according to its investor presentation on Wednesday. Comcast is not interested in doing swaps, but is seeking to buy systems, one of the people said.

100,CHTR,Time Warner Cable deal likely to have strings attached by regulators,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Any expansion by cable provider Comcast, including a deal with Charter Communications to split provider Time Warner Cable between them, would get a tough review from U.S. regulators, who might use the proposal to force Internet providers to treat all traffic equally, antitrust experts said. Charter Communications Inc reached out to Comcast Corp this week about teaming up to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, according to people familiar with the matter. Comcast is the top U.S. cable provider and video provider, Time Warner Cable is No. 2 and Charter is the fourth largest. The Federal Communications Commission and U.S. antitrust authorities will closely scrutinize any deal between the companies since it would involve a vast range of content, video, cable and telephony. But ultimately the government would be unlikely to try to stop a deal, said Robert Doyle, an antitrust expert at Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC, who argued that some antitrust concerns could probably be remedied by strategic asset sales. “We don’t think this is one that rises to the level of a challenge,” he said, referring to a lawsuit that the Justice Department could file to stop a deal. Antitrust experts agreed, however, that any approval - particularly for Comcast - would almost certainly come with strings attached. In particular, the FCC could require the companies to treat all traffic the same, which means that companies such as Comcast with lots of content would be deterred from charging customers more if they watch movies or shows owned by other providers, such as Netflix Inc. That is no small matter. Netflix’s share price fell following Tuesday’s decision by U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to reject federal “net neutrality” rules that required Internet providers to treat all web traffic equally. Antitrust expert Jacqueline Grise of the law firm Cooley LLP said there was no guarantee a deal would be approved. The merger proposal would get a careful look from antitrust regulators, but the companies might craft a “creative solution” to satisfy the government, she said. The net neutrality condition is similar to one that Comcast was required to agree to in order to win approval for a $30 billion deal to take control of NBC Universal in 2011. Those conditions expire in 2018. Or, again echoing a condition in the 2011 deal, regulators could require Comcast to make content available to online providers, said Grise. Harold Feld of the group Public Knowledge, which campaigns for the preservation of an open Internet, agreed that the 2011 agreement could lead to similar conditions should the Time Warner transaction go ahead. “The conditions that they (regulators) would want, if I were Comcast I’m not sure I would want to take,” he said. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, formally announced its $132.50 per share bid for Time Warner Cable on Monday, which the larger rival promptly rejected as too low. Bert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, urged regulators to reject the gobbling up of Time Warner Cable. “I’m very worried about control over the pipes that allow the cable company to discriminate against content particularly in the absence of a net neutrality rule. If the deal goes through, we’re likely to see a spiral of consolidation both at the pipe end and the content end,” he said. “What’s so wrong with having Time Warner (Cable) remaining an independent company?” ",1172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-timewarnercable-comcast-antitrust/time-warner-cable-deal-likely-to-have-strings-attached-by-regulators-idUSBREA0G16V20140117

102,CHTR,Debt markets braced for Charter test,"NEW YORK, Jan 17 (IFR/RLPC) - Charter Communications  will test the capacity of the high-yield bond and leveraged loan market the way Verizon did in investment-grade if it is successful in its attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable (TWC). Its USD37.3bn hostile bid, based on an offer of USD132.50 a share, would require as much as USD24bn in debt financing. Although the details of the package still need to be ironed out, and could change if Charter increases its rejected offer or joins up with a rival such as Comcast, it will probably be structured as a Double B type credit with about six times leverage, bankers said. Regardless of the fine-tuning, the bonds and loans each have the potential to be record-breakers in terms of size. The bond component will probably overtake Sprint’s USD6.5bn deal that was priced last year as the largest ever junk bond, while the loan piece could surpass HJ Heinz’s USD9.5bn loan from last year - and even Clear Channel’s USD10.7bn deal from 2008. With about USD60bn in debt, the combined company would also become the biggest high-yield issuer in the market - larger even than Telecom Italia - raising some questions as to how much investors will be able to own in the name. Despite this, bankers are confident the deal can be done - likening it to the USD28bn buyout of Heinz last year by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which needed about USD14bn of new debt. Even another big potential deal in the market requiring jumbo financing shouldn’t matter, something bankers have to consider given speculation that Sprint  - 80% owned by SoftBank Corp - may bid for T-Mobile. “This isn’t going to be a seven times leveraged deal with no equity. It will have a Double B type capital structure, and investors say they need deals like this in size,” said one debt capital markets banker. As one investor put it: “The market is wide open.” Charter, rated Ba3/BB- by Moody’s and S&P;, described the financing package as “prudent, with a longer tenor than Charter today and low cost”. It has fully negotiated USD20.5bn in new debt and a USD3.5bn bridge loan with its four banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs - and would also need to refinance existing debt of both companies if the deal goes through. “There’s bound to be a lot of playing around to see where the company can get the most benefit and the cheapest cost of capital,” said one analyst. That almost certainly means that TWC’s existing USD25bn bonds will stay in place. Currently rated Baa2/BBB/BBB, those bonds will be the cheapest debt Charter will have at its disposal, though they will almost certainly fall to junk status. Moody’s is so far the only agency to place the ratings of the companies on review for downgrade. “I can’t see any reason why those bonds will not be left in the capital structure. Just as in the Heinz buyout, they will be subordinated, and the new bonds will come in above them,” said another leveraged finance banker. “It makes no sense to take them out. They not only provide cheap debt, but they limit the amount of new debt that has to be raised.” With no change of control language in those bonds, their prices in secondary trading have sunk. In fact, they have been trading more like a Ba1 entity since talk of a bid first emerged last summer. There is some protection for bondholders that will affect the structure of the bond financing, but it’s pretty negligible. Moody’s reckons that only USD4bn-USD5bn of new secured debt can be added to the new capital structure due to indentures on the TWC bonds that cap the amount of additional liens of secured debt. The bottom line, though, is that this is just the first round of what is inevitably going to be a long process. Major TWC shareholders have said they would be receptive to a higher offer, but there’s also a chance that other cable players such as Cox could surface with rival bids. Then there’s Liberty Media. Analysts at CreditSights say Liberty could inject USD4bn to USD5bn of cash into Charter in order to maintain a 27% stake in the combined Charter/TWC entity - a move that would limit the amount of debt Charter would have to raise. Liberty has several pockets of liquidity it could tap, they say, including margin loans and the ability to raise incremental funds at SIRI. A cash injection of that magnitude could keep the Charter leverage only modestly above five times, with a quick roadmap back below that level through growth and synergies, CreditSights said. As the first analyst said: “Whatever happens, TWC is now fully in play.”",1172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/charter-timewarnercable-debt/debt-markets-braced-for-charter-test-idUSL5N0KR28F20140117
103,CHTR,Time Warner Cable mimics an Airgas negotiating move,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable TWC.N is borrowing a tactic from a three-year-old takeover battle as it seeks to fend off Charter Communications Inc’s (CHTR.O) $37.3 billion unsolicited bid. Time Warner Cable, by publicly naming the price at which it would reconsider its firm opposition to Charter’s takeover bid, is following the example of Airgas Inc ARG.N, which successfully repelled Air Products and Chemicals Inc (APD.N) in 2011 by putting forth a high number for the suitor to reach. In the earlier case, the industrial-gas supplier responded to a $70 per share offer from its rival by saying it would not sell for less than $78 per share. Air Products walked away. Similarly, Time Warner Cable is saying no to the current offer, but not never to any deal. While rejecting Charter’s $132.50 per share bid as too low last week, the company simultaneously said it would be willing to accept a bid at $160 per share. Time Warner Cable has put itself in a strong early position by suggesting an immediate counteroffer, deal lawyers and other people watching the situation closely say. The price immediately sets market expectations higher and forces Charter to make the next move. “That’s given Time Warner Cable some standing, to say that we’re not just digging in our heels. We’re defending you, our shareholders, from an inadequate offer,” said a top mergers and acquisitions lawyer who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media. The cable provider’s lack of interest in a bid below what it cited leaves Charter with the option of raising its offer to get a deal done on a friendly basis or nominating a slate of directors to Time Warner Cable’s board in order to launch a tender offer. Still, there is one key difference between the defense of Time Warner Cable and Airgas: The chemical company elects only a minority of its board each year. Even with shareholder support, an unsolicited bidder would have needed at least two years to gain the majority position necessary to force a deal through - too long for most bidders to stomach. All of Time Warner Cable’s directors stand for election every year, so Charter could conceivably try to sell the merits of a deal below $160 a share to Time Warner Cable shareholders. “Even if a majority of (Airgas) stockholders wanted to tender in favor, they couldn’t force Air Products to hang around long enough,” said Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College Law School. “Time Warner can’t do that ... because if Charter runs a proxy contest, it can replace the entire board.” Time Warner Cable’s shares are trading at around $135, above Charter’s offer and indicating investors expect the bidding to go higher. A number of large shareholders would not support the current price but are open to a deal if Charter sweetens its bid to the $145 to $150 per share range, Reuters reported last week. Most investors expect any sweetener from Charter will fall short of Time Warner Cable’s asking price, raising the specter of a proxy battle. Charter has until February 15 to nominate a slate of directors if it wants to go that route. Time Warner would then have to pitch its $160 a share target not to Charter but to shareholders. Of course any new board that resulted from a proxy fight would not necessarily vote differently from the old board. Air Products managed to add three directors to Airgas’ board, only to see those directors side with Airgas. All directors must act in the best interests of the company and would be mindful of potential legal challenges, deal lawyers say. “That slate does have duties to all shareholders and would have to be comfortable in its own right that the deal is a good one,” said Patrick Quick, partner at Milwaukee-based law firm Foley & Lardner. If Time Warner Cable can make a compelling case for its holdout bid, “they can withstand almost anything from Malone - other than him hitting their number,” said the M&A; lawyer, referring to John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media Corp Malone is trying to use Liberty’s 27 percent stake in Charter to consolidate the U.S. cable industry. Time Warner Cable has argued that $160 per share is in line with the valuations of other recent cable deals. According to the cable company’s presentation last week, Charter is only offering to pay 7.2 times estimated forward earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Time Warner Cable says that every other large cable company bought in the last four years commanded values of 8 times forward EBITDA or higher. Its own counteroffer represents 8.2 times. When Liberty bought 27 percent of Charter in March, it paid a price representing about 8.6 times forward EBITDA, according to Time Warner Cable. Just a month before the Liberty deal, Charter itself paid $1.6 billion for small cable operator Bresnan at about 8 times. Because Time Warner Cable, the second-largest U.S. cable operator after Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), considers itself the biggest and best M&A; option available, it believes it should command more, not less. Other companies, such as Cox Communications and Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N, are smaller and remain family-controlled. Some board members had argued for demanding a higher price from Charter, according to people close to the matter. By putting forward a high counteroffer so early, the company could be trying to show that Charter is hoping to buy Time Warner on the cheap. “A lot of time when the targets don’t counter or put that number on the table - and frankly, they rarely do - then there’s an argument you have a bidder: ‘Oh, look at these guys, they’re not willing to do anything,’” said a second corporate lawyer, who asked not to be named because of potential conflicts. “Putting a counter out is a big frigging negotiating move. They are empowered when they do that.” Charter has argued that Time Warner Cable’s EBITDA valuation does not necessarily apply here because unlike other previous cable deals, their offer is in cash and stock, providing potential upside to Time Warner Cable investors who would own roughly 45 percent of the merged company.

105,CHTR,"Time Warner Cable should talk to Charter, T. Rowe says","(Reuters) - A Time Warner Cable Inc investor that also has a large stake in would-be predator Charter Communications Inc is urging Time Warner Cable to talk to its smaller rival, after weeks of Charter’s aggressive campaign to win over investors. T. Rowe Price Group, Charter’s third-largest shareholder with a stake of more than 5 percent, this week wrote to Time Warner Cable, urging the No.2 cable company to have talks with Charter about a possible deal, according to people familiar with the matter. With the letter, Charter, which has been on a roadshow meeting with Time Warner Cable shareholders for the past two weeks, may be seeing the first fruits of its campaign to rally investors to support its $37.3 billion offer. Time Warner has insisted the January 13 bid was inadequate. “Charter has asked Time Warner Cable shareholders to approach Time Warner Cable management and board. This letter is consistent with that,” said ISI analyst Vijay Jayant. As of September 30, T. Rowe owned 5.16 percent of Charter shares and 2.3 percent of Time Warner Cable shares. T. Rowe is Time Warner Cable’s eighth-largest shareholder and Charter’s third-largest shareholder, the latest publicly available filings show, according to Thomson One. Besides T. Rowe, there is only one other investor, the Vanguard Group, that has a top 10 ownership position in both cable companies. Vanguard is Time Warner Cable’s No.2 shareholder with a 5.01 percent stake and is also Charter’s No.5 shareholder with a 3.31 percent stake, according to latest filings. Members of Time Warner Cable’s board have read the T. Rowe letter, but their reaction was not immediately clear, according to the people familiar with the matter. It also wasn’t known whether T. Rowe was urging Time Warner Cable to consider a deal at a specific price. Representatives from Charter, T. Rowe Price and Liberty Media declined to comment. A spokeswoman from Time Warner Cable said, “Time Warner Cable has an active, ongoing dialogue with many of its shareholders.” T. Rowe has a history of activism in the cable industry. In 2007, it opposed a buyout of Cablevision by the controlling shareholder, the Dolan family. The Baltimore-based asset management firm was also an influential opponent of Michael Dell’s initial offer to buy out Dell Inc last year. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, announced its $132.50 per share bid for Time Warner Cable on Jan 13, which the larger rival promptly rejected as too low. Time Warner Cable responded that it was open to a deal at $160 per share.

With the letter, Charter, which has been on a roadshow meeting with Time Warner Cable shareholders for the past two weeks, may be seeing the first fruits of its campaign to rally investors to support its $37.3 billion offer. Time Warner has insisted the Jan. 13 bid was inadequate. “Charter has asked Time Warner Cable shareholders to approach Time Warner Cable management and board. This letter is consistent with that,” said ISI analyst Vijay Jayant. As of Sept. 30, T. Rowe owned 5.16 percent of Charter shares and 2.3 percent of Time Warner Cable shares. T. Rowe is Time Warner Cable’s eighth-largest shareholder and Charter’s third-largest shareholder, the latest publicly available filings show, according to Thomson One. Besides T. Rowe, there is only one other investor, the Vanguard Group, that has a top 10 ownership position in both cable companies. Vanguard is Time Warner Cable’s No.2 shareholder with a 5.01 percent stake and is also Charter’s No.5 shareholder with a 3.31 percent stake, according to latest filings. Members of Time Warner Cable’s board have read the T. Rowe letter, but their reaction was not immediately clear, according to the people familiar with the matter. It also wasn’t known whether T. Rowe was urging Time Warner Cable to consider a deal at a specific price. Representatives from Charter, T. Rowe Price and Liberty Media declined to comment. A spokeswoman from Time Warner Cable said, “Time Warner Cable has an active, ongoing dialogue with many of its shareholders.” T. Rowe has a history of activism in the cable industry. In 2007, it opposed a buyout of Cablevision by the controlling shareholder, the Dolan family. The Baltimore-based asset management firm was also an influential opponent of Michael Dell’s initial offer to buy out Dell Inc last year. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, announced its $132.50 per share bid for Time Warner Cable on Jan 13, which the larger rival promptly rejected as too low. Time Warner Cable responded that it was open to a deal at $160 per share. Most investors expect any higher bid from Charter will fall short of Time Warner Cable’s asking price, raising the specter of a proxy battle. Charter has until Feb. 15 to nominate a slate of directors if it wants to go that route.",1232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/trowe-timewarner/update-2-time-warner-cable-should-talk-to-charter-t-rowe-says-idUSL2N0KX1P320140123

108,CHTR,Charter hires firm to ready Time Warner Cable proxy fight: sources,"(Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc has hired proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A; as it gears up for a potential proxy fight at takeover target Time Warner Cable Inc, according to people familiar with the matter. Charter is looking to nominate a new slate of directors to replace Time Warner Cable’s board after the larger rival rejected its $37.3 billion unsolicited takeover bid. The one-month window to nominate a new slate expires in mid-February for the annual shareholder meeting in May. Charter and its largest investor Liberty Media Corp are searching for candidates, the people said on Friday, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Representatives for Charter, Liberty Media and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Friday. Innisfree could not be immediately reached for comment. While bankers and lawyers put together mergers, proxy solicitors help companies or major investors persuade shareholders to accept or reject those deals. They are responsible for identifying companies’ shareholders and devising messages to help sway their votes. Their role is most important in situations like proxy fights, where shareholders are to vote on competing slates of board nominees. Charter is wrapping up a two-week road show, holding meetings with Time Warner Cable shareholders all over the country. On Thursday, T. Rowe Price, a large investor in both Time Warner Cable and Charter, sent a letter to Time Warner Cable urging the two companies to talk. During these meetings, shareholders have expressed interest in a deal in the mid-$140s per share range, people familiar with the matter said. Charter’s offer on January 13 was $132.50 in cash and stock. Time Warner Cable’s executives and board insist that the bid is too low and are seeking a deal at $160 or higher. Time Warner Cable shares have been trading above Charter’s offer price, closing at $133.70 on Friday. Time Warner Cable’s reluctance leaves Charter with the option of raising its bid to get a deal done on a friendly basis, or launching a proxy fight to force a deal through, analysts said. UBS analyst John Hodulik said Time Warner Cable may face shareholder pressure if Charter raises its bid, even at a price below $160. “We believe Time Warner Cable is in danger of losing a proxy fight were it to hold fast to the $160 number in the face of a bid from Charter in the $140s,” Hodulik said in a research note on Friday. He expects that in a proxy fight, Charter could put forward a slate of new directors to replace the board of Time Warner Cable, which has 13 members including Chief Executive Rob Marcus.

110,CHTR,Comcast eyes Time Warner Cable's East Coast markets: source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - No 1 cable provider Comcast, in its talks with Charter about a possible deal to acquire parts of Time Warner Cable, would be interested in an agreement that gives Comcast the New York market and parts of New England, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. Discussions between Comcast Corp and Charter Communications Inc have gotten more substantive in recent days, partly because Comcast felt takeover target Time Warner Cable was seeking too high a price for itself, the person said on Friday. Comcast is interested in acquiring Time Warner Cable’s New York City market since it already has operations in neighboring Connecticut and New Jersey, the person added. In New England, Comcast controls the Boston cable market and is also eying areas where it does not already have systems such as Maine, said the person, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Los Angeles, one of Time Warner Cable’s largest markets, is less attractive to Comcast, the person said. In one scenario being discussed between the two companies, Charter would first acquire Time Warner Cable, and then later sell off markets to Comcast to generate cash. “A combined Time Warner Cable and Charter could pay off its debt quickly if it turns around and sells off some pieces to Comcast,” the person added. The timing of an agreement between Comcast and Charter was not yet known and talks could fall apart at any time, the person cautioned. Comcast had also been considering making a solo bid for Time Warner Cable. But its thinking has changed recently because it considered Time Warner Cable’s asking price of $160 as too high, considering some of the No. 2 cable company’s operational challenges. The company was unlikely to make a bid for all of Time Warner at $150 or $160 per share, the person added. Representatives from Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Friday.

118,CHTR,Time Warner Cable charts path while rebuffing Charter,"(Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc, trying to fend off a takeover bid, posted better-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday and said it aims to increase the company’s sales while also investing more in its technology over the next three years. Shares rose $1.39 or 1 percent, to $133.49 per share. “We are geared up to manage this company for the long haul,” said CEO Rob Marcus, in his first conference call since he took over on January 1. When asked about Charter’s $132.50 rejected bid earlier in January, Marcus reiterated that Time Warner Cable is only interested in an offer above $160 per share, and would be “willing to engage” if a deal drives more shareholder value than the company can create on its own. “We said the price it would take to transact would be $160 and this is specific to Charter, $100 in cash, $60 in Charter stock,” Marcus added. The company, which is trying to convince investors it can do a better job at operating its business than its suitor Charter Communications Inc, unveiled a plan aimed at improving the company’s spotty customer service and investing more in its technology. Time Warner Cable said it would increase annual capital expenditures to $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion over the next three years, which should allow the company to improve its cable systems, invest in infrastructure and replace older equipment. Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said this capital investment is 5 to 10 percent above her own estimates and said it will help Time Warner Cable speed up plans to upgrade its cable systems. “Rather than smoothing this out over time, they’re pulling the spending forward and finishing up their digitization plan,” Yong said, referring to Time Warner Cable’s plan to convert its systems to a digital signal. The company expects to generate revenue of $25.7 billion, and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization of $9.4 billion, by 2016. These goals are marginally above Street estimates, according to MoffettNathanson Research analyst Craig Moffett. Analysts liked Time Warner Cable’s plan but cautioned it would not be a quick turnaround. “The strategy shift and the guidance is encouraging. However, it will take some time for management to recover investor confidence in their ability to execute,” said New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin. Moffett said, “the question that remains is whether any of this is enough.” He expects Charter to sweeten its bid above $140 and receive some cash from Comcast after the deal. Reuters has reported Comcast is interested in buying some of Time Warner Cable’s markets such as New York City. Marcus also dismissed the notion that Time Warner Cable lags Charter operationally. Charter’s campaign for investor support to its $37.3 billion bid has focused on how Charter could run Time Warner Cable better under its CEO Tom Rutledge (For more on Rutledge, see: [ID:nL2N0KX2O9]) Charter has been quick to point out that Time Warner Cable suffers from one of the industry’s poorest customer service records, has lost subscribers at a higher rate than other large operators, and lags in the roll out of new technology. Time Warner Cable released a presentation showing how it has higher margins than Charter and offers more products and a better business services unit, which is the fastest growing area in the cable industry right now. A Charter spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the presentation. The company said revenue would rise 4 percent to 5 percent this year, above the roughly 2 percent analysts are expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its free cash flow this year will be flat at $2.5 billion.

119,CHTR,UPDATE 3-Time Warner Cable charts path while rebuffing Charter,"By Liana B. Baker Jan 30 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc, trying to fend off a takeover bid, posted better-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday and said it aims to increase the company’s sales while also investing more in its technology over the next three years. Shares rose $1.39 or 1 percent, to $133.49 per share. “We are geared up to manage this company for the long haul,” said CEO Rob Marcus, in his first conference call since he took over on Jan. 1. When asked about Charter’s $132.50 rejected bid earlier in January, Marcus reiterated that Time Warner Cable is only interested in an offer above $160 per share, and would be “willing to engage” if a deal drives more shareholder value than the company can create on its own. “We said the price it would take to transact would be $160 and this is specific to Charter, $100 in cash, $60 in Charter stock,” Marcus added. The company, which is trying to convince investors it can do a better job at operating its business than its suitor Charter Communications Inc, unveiled a plan aimed at improving the company’s spotty customer service and investing more in its technology. Time Warner Cable said it would increase annual capital expenditures to $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion over the next three years, which should allow the company to improve its cable systems, invest in infrastructure and replace older equipment. Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said this capital investment is 5 to 10 percent above her own estimates and said it will help Time Warner Cable speed up plans to upgrade its cable systems. “Rather than smoothing this out over time, they’re pulling the spending forward and finishing up their digitization plan,” Yong said, referring to Time Warner Cable’s plan to convert its systems to a digital signal. The company expects to generate revenue of $25.7 billion, and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization of $9.4 billion, by 2016. These goals are marginally above Street estimates, according to MoffettNathanson Research analyst Craig Moffett. Analysts liked Time Warner Cable’s plan but cautioned it would not be a quick turnaround. “The strategy shift and the guidance is encouraging. However, it will take some time for management to recover investor confidence in their ability to execute,” said New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin. Moffett said, “the question that remains is whether any of this is enough.” He expects Charter to sweeten its bid above $140 and receive some cash from Comcast after the deal . Reuters has reported Comcast is interested in buying some of Time Warner Cable’s markets such as New York City. Marcus also dismissed the notion that Time Warner Cable  lags Charter operationally. Charter’s campaign for investor support to its $37.3 billion bid has focused on how Charter could run Time Warner Cable better under its CEO Tom Rutledge (For more on Rutledge, see: ) Charter has been quick to point out that Time Warner Cable suffers from one of the industry’s poorest customer service records, has lost subscribers at a higher rate than other large operators, and lags in the roll out of new technology. Time Warner Cable released a presentation showing how it has higher margins than Charter and offers more products and a better business services unit, which is the fastest growing area in the cable industry right now. A Charter spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the presentation. The company said revenue would rise 4 percent to 5 percent this year, above the roughly 2 percent analysts are expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its free cash flow this year will be flat at $2.5 billion.

120,CHTR,Analysis: Charter's bid for Time Warner Cable hinges on Rutledge's skill,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Charter Communications Inc campaigns for investor support for its $37.3 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc, Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge and his turnaround skills are front and center of that effort. But Rutledge’s track record as chief operating officer of Cablevision Systems Corp from 2004 to 2011 shows that he may not be quite the miracle worker that allies like to portray him as. In meetings with Time Warner Cable shareholders, Rutledge, 60, and his management team have pledged to revive the fortunes of the second-largest U.S. cable operator. Time Warner Cable suffers from one of the industry’s poorest customer service records, has lost subscribers at a higher rate than other large operators, and lags in the rollout of new technology. In contrast, Rutledge has pointed to his successes at Charter, where he has stemmed some subscriber losses and boosted its fortunes since he was appointed CEO in February 2012, thanks in part to measures he put in place to simplify pricing and improve video technology. Rutledge’s performance at Cablevision, however, was more mixed, especially near the end of his tenure. While he was at the Bethpage, New York-based company, it increased its market share to industry-leading penetration rates, but by the time of his departure, total customer growth had stalled, with many customers defecting to Verizon Communications Inc’s FiOS video service. Cablevision’s stock, which roughly doubled during his first seven years as COO, fell 15 percent in 2011. The Dolan family, Cablevision’s controlling shareholder, took on a more active role and made some management changes. In December of that year, Rutledge resigned. “Rutledge has this halo around him that I think is somewhat suspect. There was frankly a lot of low hanging fruit at the time in terms of driving data penetration and capturing voice share,” said Brean Capital analyst Todd Mitchell. “He has a halo because of what he did there but it did not last beyond him and it looks like it was coming apart before he left.” Mitchell said he is skeptical that Charter can turn around Time Warner Cable, pointing to tough competition from Verizon’s FiOS in its largest market, New York. While Time Warner Cable’s share price has increased almost five fold since it was spun off from Time Warner Inc in 2009, the operator’s growth has matured in many of its territories. A Charter spokesman declined to make Rutledge available for an interview. “Tom’s operational performance as COO of Cablevision ... and CEO of Charter Communications for the past two years is on full display,” the spokesman said, adding that Charter’s management team is focused on its turnaround. To pay Time Warner Cable shareholders, Charter has said it will raise about $25 billion in debt and bring the combined company’s leverage ratio - a measure of indebtedness - to five times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), higher than Time Warner Cable’s current ratio of about three times. Time Warner Cable shareholders will also receive Charter shares as part of the potential deal, so they are not cashing out completely and will need to be convinced that Rutledge can deliver on promises to make the combined company grow. Rutledge has told shareholders that there will be about $500 million in synergies in the first year, and that he will employ much of the strategy he has at Charter. He has said he will introduce a better pricing scheme, make Time Warner Cable’s systems all-digital, which should make the product more advanced, and also improve customer service, an area in which the company has traditionally scored low in consumer surveys. Rutledge is credited with being an expert at managing fleets of workers in the field, improving customer service and pioneering the concept of the “triple play,” the combination of Internet, video and phone service that became the marketing standard in the industry. He joined Cablevision as the president of cable and communications in 2002, after he was passed over at Time Warner Cable for a CEO position that went to Glenn Britt. Cablevision was already enjoying rapid growth in its tightly clustered market outside of New York City, but Rutledge helped it expand into Internet and voice services through the “triple play” offering. Rutledge was paid well for his performance - $23 million in 2011, $28 million in 2010 and $26 million in 2009. He was viewed as a “rock star” inside Cablevision, according to former colleagues, and commuted to work from Connecticut via a helicopter provided by the company. Still, Rutledge had a down-to-earth manner and often showed respect for cable workers in the field since he started himself as a trainee at a company that later became part of Time Warner Cable. Rutledge, who loves to ski and owns a home in Colorado, also has a reputation as a tough negotiator. Cablevision fought high-profile battles with media companies over fees the cable company had to pay to carry their content - and those fights sometimes cost the company subscribers. In 2010, Cablevision lost 35,000 subscribers after a fee dispute with Fox caused it to blackout Cablevision during Major League Baseball’s World Series. By 2011, analysts say Rutledge had fallen out of favor with the Dolan family, especially CEO James Dolan. The Federal Communications Commission published a report, entitled “Measuring Broadband America,” that found Verizon’s FiOS service was the top provider at delivering on its advertised Internet speeds while Cablevision was the worst performer. Dolan held Rutledge personally responsible for letting Cablevision’s broadband service fall behind its peers, according to BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. A spokesman for Cablevision declined to comment, citing company policy not to discuss former employees. That year, Cablevision also missed a target set five years earlier for cumulative adjusted operating cash flow of about $1 billion, said Leo Hindery, a former cable executive who is a managing partner of private equity firm Intermedia Partners. The year 2011 was also tough for Time Warner Cable. Like Cablevision, it was hit by competition from Verizon’s FiOS and lost video subscribers every quarter. Greg Maffei, the CEO of Liberty Media, which is Charter’s biggest shareholder, does not hold Cablevision’s performance in 2011 against Rutledge. Maffei said in a statement last week that “a key reason Liberty invested in Charter was the strength of Tom Rutledge and his management team.” Since taking over Charter, Rutledge has streamlined management, simplified pricing and packaging and focused the sales effort on “triple play,” according to UBS analyst John Hodulik. Charter’s video product has been improved by adding more high definition content, reduced the rate of cancellations and increasing revenue per subscriber, he said. Hodulik said he could see shares of the combined company rise to $200 per share in 18 months after a deal, due to free cash flow growth and Rutledge’s operating playbook. Since he became CEO, Charter shares have more than doubled, including gains logged after news of a Time Warner Cable bid emerged. It is also true that Charter, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, started from a low base. Its market share is low compared to rivals and it suffered from under-investment for years. Rutledge’s supporters say he will be able to improve Time Warner Cable’s operations as well. But critics say Time Warner Cable could make similar changes on its own, without Charter. “Given enough time, Time Warner Cable management would probably be able to narrow the gap between its performance and that of Comcast. There is, after all, little secret sauce in the cable business,” said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett.

121,CHTR,Exclusive: Charter may raise Time Warner Cable bid within weeks - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc is discussing raising its bid for Time Warner Cable Inc as soon as in the next two weeks, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that could pressure its reluctant rival ahead of a proxy deadline. Charter is considering a higher bid in the low 140s per share range, the people said on Friday, up from its current $132.50 per share offer that values the second-largest U.S. cable operator at $37.3 billion based on shares outstanding. A new price at around $142.50 per share has been discussed, but no decision has been made, one of the people added. The likely bump reflects feedback from Time Warner Cable investors Charter has received in its two-week roadshow, that person added. While timing of any new bid has yet to be decided and may change, Charter could sweeten its offer before, or at the same time it nominates a slate of directors for Time Warner Cable’s board, people familiar with the matter said. The one-month window to nominate a new slate expires in mid-February for the annual shareholder meeting expected in May. All the people asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for Charter, Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment. With no rival bidder for Time Warner Cable in sight, Charter may also hold out on a sweetener until after it nominates a slate, one of the people said. It could also wait until it reaches an agreement with Comcast Corp about carving up Time Warner Cable, the person added. Charter and Comcast are in discussions about how to carve up Time Warner Cable’s markets, the people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Comcast is interested in owning Time Warner Cable’s systems in New York City and in parts of New England such as Maine, but has little interest in Los Angeles, another of Time Warner Cable’s largest markets, Reuters previously reported. The deal could also involve some Charter-owned systems going to Comcast, such as Worcester, Massachusetts, the people said. Under the proposed deal, Comcast would buy the cable systems from Charter if Charter succeeds in acquiring Time Warner Cable. The details and timing of a potential agreement remain unclear. UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a research note on Friday that a bid of $140-145 would be necessary to get support from Time Warner Cable investors. “We would expect Charter to move forward with plans for a proxy fight but believe a new, higher bid may come given the support it would have from Time Warner Cable shareholders and our modeling that suggests ample value for both sides,” Hodulik said.

132,CHTR,RPT-DEALTALK-How Charter's Time Warner Cable bid woke up a 'sleeping beast',"(Repeats with no changes ( By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Talks between Comcast Corp  and Charter Communications Inc over how they could together buy Time Warner Cable Inc quickly soured as the two bickered over price and the feasibility of engineering a split of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator. Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, had been pursuing Time Warner for months, but was not making any headway as its larger rival - nearly three times its size by market value - asked for $8 billion more than what it had offered. But Comcast actually believed Time Warner Cable’s $160 per share counter to Charter’s $132.50 per share bid was reasonable, several people familiar with the situation said on Thursday. At the same time, it worried that splitting a public company with assets in multiple markets and millions of subscribers would be tough, made even harder by the acrimony that had built up over the past eight months between Charter and Time Warner Cable. On Feb. 4 Comcast and Charter met in a last-ditch attempt to see if they could work out their differences, the sources said. They could not. So later in the day, Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts called Time Warner Cable’s Rob Marcus to say that he was ready to make a bid for all of Time Warner Cable at a figure close to the asking price, according to the sources. On Thursday, the two announced a $45.2 billion all-stock deal to create a cable behemoth, with an empire stretching from New York to Los Angeles. The deal is the largest M&A; transaction so far this year and the third-largest in the media and entertainment sector of all time, according to Thomson Reuters data. If the deal closes, it could give Comcast unprecedented leverage in negotiations with content providers and advertisers. For that reason it is also likely to come under keen regulatory scrutiny. Representatives for Time Warner Cable, Comcast and Charter declined to comment on details of the negotiations. All the sources asked not to be named because the conversations were private. Interviews with several people who were intimately involved in negotiations, however, paint a picture of what went on behind the scenes over the last few days as the deal came together and how Charter lost a prize that it had worked so hard to win. In some ways, these sources said, the two companies have Charter to thank for the deal. Although Comcast, the top U.S. cable operator, had always been intrigued by the idea of buying Time Warner Cable, a deal was not on its list of priorities until Charter put it in play last summer. In the end, one of the sources said, all Charter did was “wake up the sleeping beast.” John Paulson, whose Paulson & Co hedge fund is one of Time Warner Cable’s top 10 shareholders, said of Comcast in an interview with Reuters: “They’re gentlemen, old school businessmen. But they’re also aggressive.” Charter’s next steps were not clear on Thursday. It had nominated a slate of directors to replace the entire board of Time Warner Cable on Tuesday, but was kept in the dark as its prize was slipping away to another buyer. Time Warner Cable CEO Marcus, in the job for just 44 days, said in an interview that the deal, while good for his shareholders, is bittersweet for him. “I was looking forward to thousands of days, not tens of days doing this job,” Marcus said. Still, the former Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP M&A; lawyer who over the past eight years had served in various roles at Time Warner Cable, including its top dealmaker and chief operating officer, just pulled off one of his largest deals ever. And thanks to his tenure at the company, he could take home some $50 million after it closes. “Sometimes you don’t have control over how things unfold,” Marcus said. Things moved quickly over the last 10 days, the sources said. After months of pursuing Time Warner Cable without success and speaking informally with Comcast last year, Charter approached Comcast once again in the middle of January about teaming up. The idea was for Charter to buy all of Time Warner Cable and later sell off select systems to Comcast. Comcast, with a $138 billion market value, dwarfs Charter’s $13.43 billion, as well as Time Warner Cable’s $40 billion market capitalization as of Thursday. But as the two discussed options, Comcast became increasingly uncomfortable with Charter’s hostile approach and more skeptical that Charter would be able to win Time Warner Cable’s blessing with its offer, the sources said. Comcast also became increasingly excited about the prospect of buying Time Warner Cable on its own. Comcast felt that it could pay between $150 and $160 per share for Time Warner Cable, the sources said. Initially it was also willing to put cash along with stock into the deal. But one of the sources said Time Warner Cable wanted an all-stock deal and for Comcast to use the cash instead to initiate a large share buyback program after the transaction closed to boost the share price of the combined company. That meant Time Warner Cable shareholders would end up owning 23 percent of the combined company and also not have to pay taxes as a result of the transaction. In return for paying the price, however, Roberts had one demand: Comcast would not pay a reverse break-up fee, or the penalty that a buyer pays to the seller if it fails to close a deal, typically because of regulatory reasons, the sources said. The request was unusual for a deal that was sure to face regulatory scrutiny. A few years ago, for example, AT&T; Inc  agreed to pay as much as $6 billion as reverse breakup fee, paid in cash and spectrum, as part of its deal to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion. The deal was shot down by regulators, and AT&T; had to pay the fees. Some lawyers said such fees are rare in the cable industry, however. “These businesses operate fairly independent enough and if this deal does not get approved, there is not going to be that much damage to Time Warner Cable,” said Robert Townsend, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster’s global M&A; practice. Comcast CEO Roberts said he did not recall ever agreeing to a reverse termination fee, not even in its $30 billion buyout of majority of NBC Universal in 2009. Time Warner Cable’s board determined that the proposed transaction should get regulatory approval because the companies do not operate in the same markets, the sources said. They agreed to Comcast’s condition. Talks were further aided by the fact that executives from the two companies knew each other and were friendly, the sources said. They also had worked together on a deal previously. In 2006, the two split up bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications in a complicated $17.6 billion transaction. Marcus was Time Warner’s lead negotiator on the deal at that time. This time around, the two chief executives, along with Comcast Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis and Time Warner Cable’s Arthur Minson, negotiated key points of the deal by phone as well as in-person meetings in New York, without relying much on advisers. The two sides agreed a final deal price of $158.82 per share on Monday morning, and the board of each company approved the transaction on Wednesday evening. “Throughout the whole process with Charter, I consistently said one thing - insufficient value. They didn’t value the unique asset that was Time Warner Cable,” Marcus said. “On the simplest level, the TWC-Comcast merger was superior.”",2142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/timewarnercable-comcast/rpt-dealtalk-how-charters-time-warner-cable-bid-woke-up-a-sleeping-beast-idUSL2N0LJ04D20140214

135,CHTR,Cable TV operator Charter to 'wisely' pursue deals,"(Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc, whose bid to take over Time Warner Cable Inc was thwarted earlier this month, plans to grow its subscriber base through more deals, its chief executive said on a call with analysts on Friday. Charter CEO Tom Rutledge made few remarks about the company’s failed pursuit of Time Warner Cable after having mounted a proxy battle last week. “Notwithstanding everything that has happened, we are still interested in wisely acquiring subscribers through M&A; when that opportunity arises,” Rutledge said. Charter was outmaneuvered in its $37.3 billion bid to acquire Time Warner Cable when Comcast Corp offered $45.2 billion. Rutledge declined to comment when asked if he was worried about the size of Comcast, already the No. 1 cable provider in the United States, if regulators allow the Time Warner Cable deal to go through. Executives with satellite operators Dish Network Corp and DirecTV voiced concern during their earnings calls on Thursday and Friday over the competitive landscape if the Comcast merger with Time Warner Cable is completed. Charter is the No. 4 U.S. cable company and is backed by billionaire John Malone. On Friday, it reported net income of $39 million, or 35 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $40 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Quarterly revenue rose 12.3 percent to $2.15 billion. The company acquired Bresnan Broadband Holdings for $1.6 billion in February 2013, adding 670,000 homes and about 375,000 residential and business customers. Charter shares were trading down 5.2 percent to $125.02in early afternoon. The company said its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose about 3 percent to $764 million. Analysts had expected a profit of 24 cents per share on revenue of $2.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Video revenue, which accounts for about half of total revenue, rose 12.8 percent. Internet revenue, which accounts for more than a quarter of total revenue, rose 22.4 percent. Revenue from sales to small and medium-size businesses and to carrier customers rose 28.8 percent. The company added 93,000 residential Internet customers compared with 59,000 customers a year ago. Charter’s residential customers grew by 63,000 in the quarter, up from 24,000 in the same period year ago. Revenue per customer relationship rose 2 percent to $107.97. Charter said it expects to boost spending by 19 percent to $2.2 billion in 2014 as it digitalizes set-top boxes and invests in its commercial business.

138,CHTR,Charter can pursue consolidation with smaller players: analysts,"(Reuters) - Charter Communications (CHTR.O), still rebounding from its failure to buy larger rival Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N, is left with the prospect of acquiring smaller players to satisfy its aim of driving U.S. cable consolidation, according to industry analysts. Those likely to be on Charter’s potential shopping list include Cox Communications COXC.UL, Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N, Mediacom LLC and Suddenlink, observers say. There “are at least a few baby elephants left on the M&A; savanna,” said Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities, Inc. Charter and its billionaire backer John Malone had courted Time Warner Cable for months, but were outmaneuvered by Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) $45.2 billion merger bid, announced on February 13. Malone, whose Liberty Media Corp LMCA.O holds a 27 percent stake in Charter, has been touting the benefits of cable consolidation at every turn. The billionaire investor has long argued that cable companies should team up to fight high programming costs and competition from telecoms and satellite TV companies. In addition, Google Inc (GOOG.O) announced this week that it is planning a major expansion of its super-fast “Fiber” TV network, posing another potential threat to cable operators. Shareholders are certain to be asking how Charter, the U.S.’s fourth largest cable operator with 4 million subscribers, intends to accomplish those goals without Time Warner Cable. As the country’s second-largest cable operator, Time Warner Cable has over 11 million subscribers. Charter will have a chance to update shareholders about its plans on Friday, when it reports fourth-quarter earnings. But the cable operator likely cannot approach a potential target until it knows which cable systems Comcast will spin off, said Tom Eagan, an analyst with Northland Capital Markets. Comcast has said it will likely part with about 3 million of the 33 million subscribers joint subscribers of the two companies. Of the two largest cable operators likely to be on Charter’s list - Cablevision and Cox - Eagan figures that Charter is more likely to acquire Cox, the country’s third-largest operator. It is privately held by the Cox family, which might be willing to sell at the higher multiples cable is getting, he said. None of the companies that might be on Charter’s list have the breadth and capability that Charter was looking for in Time Warner Cable, but there is logic to combining Charter with a number of smaller companies. “It may take a little longer but it won’t get as long a review as Time Warner Cable and Comcast will,” said a person familiar with the situation, referring to regulatory scrutiny. Taking a look at Europe may also provide a clue. Malone is chairman of Liberty Global (LBTYA.O), Europe’s largest cable operator, and has expanded his cable empire there over the past decade via acquisitions from Ireland to Romania. In January, Liberty Global said it would buy Dutch operator Ziggo ZIGGO.AS for 10 billion euros ($13.71 billion).

140,CHTR,Liberty says Charter would look at buying Comcast divestitures,"(Reuters) - Charter Communications would consider buying subscribers that Comcast could divest as part of its proposed Time Warner Cable takeover, Greg Maffei, chief executive of Charter’s largest stakeholder, Liberty Media, said on Friday. These were Liberty Media’s first comments since Charter Communications (CHTR.O), in which it has a 27 stake, lost out on acquiring Time Warner Cable TWC.N to Comcast. Although Comcast, the top U.S. cable operator, had always been intrigued by the idea of buying Time Warner Cable, a deal was not on its list of priorities until Charter put it in play last summer. Maffei told a conference call that Charter could still go after Time Warner Cable if regulators reject the Comcast deal, although he expects it to win approval, though perhaps with “onerous conditions.” Maffei said he thinks the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal will ultimately be approved by regulators but said if the deal were to fall through, Liberty and Charter Communications (CHTR.O) are leaving the option on the table of acquiring Time Warner Cable. Maffei said he wants Liberty and Charter to be “flexible both for acquisitions of other systems or potentially the divestitures out of Time Warner or if the Time Warner deal is not able to be completed — looking back at the whole thing,” he said. Comcast has said it is willing to divest 3 million subscribers. While Charter, driven by Liberty Media, missed out on acquiring Time Warner Cable, Maffei did not rule out further cable deals. “We certainly learned in this process that there were many investors who are interested in investing in cable consolidation either with Charter or alongside Liberty. And I suspect if a need arises for additional equity for a cable consolidation play, we’ll see a lot of interest,” he said. Liberty last month offered to buy out Sirius XM’s minority shareholders in a deal that could be worth more than $10 billion. The deal would make the entire asset part of Liberty’s portfolio and take the public shares off the market. Liberty currently owns more than half of Sirius XM. Shareholders such as consumer advocate Ralph Nader have spoken out against the deal, an offer of $3.68 per share that provides little premium to shareholders. Sirius XM shares were trading at $3.62 per share on Friday. Liberty said it still wants to go through with the deal and use Sirius XM’s cash for share repurchase or strategic acquisitions. Maffei said Liberty was in touch with Sirius XM’s special committee, which is studying the offer. While he suggested there could be a bit of room for Sirius XM’s committee to negotiate a higher price, he said that a deal does not have to get done and in terms of price, “there certainly are limits to what would be appealing.” Maxim Securities analyst John Tinker said that Maffei is in full negotiating mode and “is very clear that at a certain price they don’t need to do the deal.” ",2282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-liberty-charter/liberty-says-charter-would-look-at-buying-comcast-divestitures-idUSBREA1R1KR20140228
141,CHTR,Time Warner Cable rejects Charter's call to drop Comcast merger,"(Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc said on Friday it was committed to a deal reached with larger cable operator Comcast Corp in response to calls by Charter Communications that shareholders reject the $45 billion merger. Charter, which was rebuffed in its bid for Time Warner Cable, said in a statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the planned merger of Time Warner Cable and Comcast posed a high degree of regulatory risk and warned that approval could drag on until the first quarter of 2015. TWC and Comcast announced their all-stock agreement on February 13, which at the time gave the deal a value of $158.82 per share. Charter argued in the filing that, due to Comcast’s declining share price, the value was now worth $141.16 a share.

144,CHTR,Comcast in talks with Charter over divestitures: source,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) is in talks with Charter Communications (CHTR.O) over selling or spinning off roughly 3 million subscribers worth approximately $18 billion to $20 billion as part of the divestitures related to its $45.3 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable TWC.N, according to a source familiar with the matter. The talks center around either a straight sale of 3 million or so subscribers, or the potential creation of a spinoff in which Charter would buy a substantial minority stake, the source added. There may be other options the two companies are discussing, the source said, adding that while the negotiations with Charter are serious, they are still in the early stages and could fall apart. Other cable companies also are interested in Comcast’s divested subscribers, according to the source. The Financial Times first reported the news of the talks with Charter. A Comcast spokesman declined to comment on Saturday while representatives for Time Warner Cable and Charter could not be reached for comment. Executives from Comcast and Time Warner Cable earlier this month sought to reassure lawmakers that the merger between the two largest U.S. cable companies would not result in higher prices for cable TV and Internet packages. Comcast already has pledged to divest 3 million subscribers to keep the combined company’s subscriber base just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television market. The source said that the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal has to be approved by regulators before any divestitures occur. However, Comcast could reach an agreement earlier with another cable company such as Charter, whose largest investor is John Malone’s Liberty Media LMCA.O, that would be contingent on the merger being approved by regulators. The 3 million subscriber number could still change but, the source said, it would unlikely be as large as 5 million subscribers. The location of the subscribers in question was unknown. The merged company would serve between 20 percent to 40 percent of high-speed Internet customers in the United States, Comcast has said in a Federal Communications Commission filing. The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee is expected to hold a hearing on the deal early next month.

Paul Ghaffari, who has been chief investment officer of Vulcan Capital - Allen’s private investment unit - since 2010, will leave on Friday, Vulcan said in a statement on Monday. “We appreciate Paul’s service at Vulcan and the contributions he made to growing and expanding our investments across all stages of corporate development,” said Jody Allen, chief executive of Vulcan Inc and Paul Allen’s sister. “We wish him the best of luck.” Ghaffari, who previously handled investments for billionaire George Soros and founded a fund firm later acquired by Morgan Stanley, was a high profile hire for Allen three and a half  years ago. In his time there, Ghaffari has taken some of the credit for bringing order to Allen’s technology, energy and equities portfolio. Despite some early misfires, including the loss of billions of dollars on cable company Charter Communications Inc, Allen’s investments are paying off lately, especially his property portfolio in Seattle’s booming South Lake Union and his ownership of the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. Ghaffari will be replaced in the interim by Abhishek Agrawal, who currently heads Vulcan Capital’s Palo Alto office. His exit follows that of Allen’s technology adviser, Parag Garg, who left the job recently less than six months after starting work at Vulcan. Sue Coliton, long-time vice president of the Paul G.

147,CHTR,Comcast nears deal with Charter on $18-$20 billion in divestitures: source,"(Reuters) - Comcast may divest about 4 million subscribers after its merger with Time Warner Cable and is working to reach an accord to sell a portion of those customers to Charter Communications, a source familiar with the matter said Tuesday. Comcast is studying what could be a two-phase process, where Charter would first acquire up to 1.5 million subscribers directly from Comcast, the source said on condition of anonymity because discussions were continuing and a final agreement had not been struck. Comcast would then spin off the rest of the 2.5 million subscribers into a separate, publicly traded company, which Charter would take a minority stake in, the source added. The roughly 4 million subscribers are worth between $18 billion and $20 billion, said the source. Comcast and Charter would also swap about 1 million cable subscribers, including Charter’s subscribers in Los Angeles. It was not yet clear what markets Comcast would swap with Charter or spin off, although the companies would likely trade subscribers adjacent to their exisiting markets. Any agreement the companies reach would be contingent on Comcast’s $45.3 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable being approved by regulators, a process that could take many more months while the Justice Department and U.S. Federal Communications Commission study that deal.

149,CHTR,"Comcast adds video subscribers, beats Street","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable operator, posted higher first-quarter revenue and net income on Tuesday and showed it could add video subscribers for two quarters in a row, a rare occurrence in the cable industry. The company, whose shares closed 2 percent higher, said it added 24,000 net video subscribers in the first quarter. That surprised analysts who expected a loss of 26,000 net subscribers, according to StreetAccount. Last year’s fourth quarter marked Comcast’s first upswing in cable video subscribers in more than six years. Most cable companies have been shedding video subscribers for the past few years, losing them to satellite and telecom rivals as well as newer Web-based entrants such as Netflix Inc. “Two straight quarters of basic video subscriber gains, even small ones, isn’t enough to call a reversal of perennial losses,” said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett in a research note. “But it’s a start.” Comcast’s high-speed Internet growth slowed in the quarter. It added 383,000 net subscribers, fewer than a year ago and missing estimates. Comcast’s Internet business was criticized by Netflix on Monday, capping months of tussling over the speed at which Comcast delivers the online streaming service to its cable customers. Comcast, which made a $45.3 billion bid to acquire second-largest U.S. cable operator Time Warner Cable in February, said it had $17 million in costs related to the acquisition in the quarter. It is waiting for approval from U.S. regulators on that deal. Time Warner Cable will release quarterly results on Thursday. Comcast’s chief financial officer, Michael Angelakis, said on Tuesday there is no timeline on when the company will make a decision regarding subscribers it has volunteered to divest as part of its takeover of Time Warner Cable. The company is studying a “number of potential structures” and wants to pursue divestitures in the “most tax-efficient way possible,” he told analysts on a conference call. Any cash proceeds from a spinoff or sale would be used for returning capital to shareholders, he said. Comcast has not yet revealed what markets it is considering exiting but is in negotiations with Charter Communications Inc over a potential deal for under 4 million customers as well as a major swap of subscribers, according to a source familiar with the matter. The source cautioned that the deal could fall apart at any time. Other cable companies and some unspecified private equity firms are still interested in the divestitures, added the person, who could not speak for attribution because terms of the potential deal were not public.

150,CHTR,"UPDATE 3-Comcast adds video subscribers, beats Street","* Posts two straight quarters of basic video subscriber gains * Proposed Time Warner Cable takeover still pending regulatory approval * Negotiating with Charter over swaps, about 4 mln subs -source * Adds fewer high-speed Internet customers than year ago   (Adds details on Charter negotiations over divestitures, closing share price) By Liana B. Baker April 22 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable operator, posted higher first-quarter revenue and net income on Tuesday and showed it could add video subscribers for two quarters in a row, a rare occurrence in the cable industry. The company, whose shares closed 2 percent higher, said it added 24,000 net video subscribers in the first quarter. That surprised analysts who expected a loss of 26,000 net subscribers, according to StreetAccount. Last year’s fourth quarter marked Comcast’s first upswing in cable video subscribers in more than six years. Most cable companies have been shedding video subscribers for the past few years, losing them to satellite and telecom rivals as well as newer Web-based entrants such as Netflix Inc . “Two straight quarters of basic video subscriber gains, even small ones, isn’t enough to call a reversal of perennial losses,” said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett in a research note. “But it’s a start.” Comcast’s high-speed Internet growth slowed in the quarter. It added 383,000 net subscribers, fewer than a year ago and missing estimates. Comcast’s Internet business was criticized by Netflix on Monday, capping months of tussling over the speed at which Comcast delivers the online streaming service to its cable customers. Comcast, which made a $45.3 billion bid to acquire second-largest U.S. cable operator Time Warner Cable in February, said it had $17 million in costs related to the acquisition in the quarter. It is waiting for approval from U.S. regulators on that deal. Time Warner Cable will release quarterly results on Thursday. Comcast’s chief financial officer, Michael Angelakis, said on Tuesday there is no timeline on when the company will make a decision regarding subscribers it has volunteered to divest as part of its takeover of Time Warner Cable. The company is studying a “number of potential structures” and wants to pursue divestitures in the “most tax-efficient way possible,” he told analysts on a conference call.

154,CHTR,Comcast in deal with Charter as it seeks approval for TWC,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp on Monday agreed to a three-way deal with Charter Communications Inc as part of Comcast’s efforts to win regulatory approvals for its proposed $45 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc. The transaction would make Charter, which lost out to Comcast in a bid to acquire Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable provider in the United States. The agreement would leave Comcast with less than 30 percent of the U.S. residential cable or satellite TV market, a factor seen as a key step to pleasing regulators. Charter would have about 6 percent of the pay-TV market, with an eventual shot to climb to 9 percent. Under the deal, Charter would pay Comcast $7.3 billion for 1.4 million subscribers. Comcast would divest another 2.5 million subscribers into a new publicly traded company that would be two-thirds owned by Comcast shareholders and one-third owned by Charter. In addition, Comcast and Charter would trade about 1.6 million subscribers in different parts of the country. “For Charter, this deal is a transformative event and sets them up over time to consolidate the balance of the rest of the cable industry,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak told Reuters, adding that the deal was good for both parties. Comcast is awaiting approval by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to take over Time Warner Cable, something that likely will take many months and could impact the future of cable and broadband. Charter’s shares were up almost 8 percent at $139.90 in mid-morning trading while Comcast shares were up 1.4 percent at Under the deal for the new company, Charter would manage the as-yet-to-be named company and Charter CEO Tom Rutledge would become its chairman. The company would have an estimated enterprise value of $14.3 billion and an equity value of $5.8 billion, Charter and Comcast said in an investor presentation. (r.reuters.com/vyd88v) A person familiar with the deal said there was a standstill agreement with Charter stipulating that it cannot gain full control of the new company for four years. Comcast will have no ownership. The entire deal with Charter is contingent on Comcast closing the Time Warner Cable acquisition. If the agreement with Comcast goes through, Charter would leapfrog Cox Communications Inc and become the second-biggest U.S. pay TV company, with 5.7 million customers. The deal also marks an acceleration of John Malone’s effective return to cable through his investment vehicle Liberty Media Corp, which owns about 27 percent of Charter. Liberty Media got involved in working with Comcast but Charter did the nuts and bolts of the deal, the person familiar with the matter said.

160,CHTR,Liberty Media announces new spin-off of cable assets,"(Reuters) - Liberty Media Corp is spinning off its cable assets, including a stake in Charter Communications Inc, into a new publicly traded company called Liberty Broadband, the media holding company said on Thursday.  “We believe a separate Liberty Broadband will offer investors greater choice and transparency, and is well-timed with Charter’s agreements with Comcast, which will result in Charter owning or serving over eight million video customers,” Liberty Media Chief Executive Officer Greg Maffei said. Maffei’s boss, Liberty Media Chairman John Malone, is famous for complicated stock structures designed to be tax-efficient.  The announcement came amid more clarity on Charter’s expansion plans. In a call with analysts to discuss Liberty Media’s first-quarter results, Maffei said Charter is a “natural acquirer of pretty much any cable asset that gets sold.” A separate Liberty Broadband could help raise capital for Charter, he added. On April 28, Charter said it would pay Comcast $7.3 billion for 1.4 million cable subscribers and trade about 1.6 million subscribers in different parts of the country in a deal that depends on regulatory approval of Comcast’s takeover of Time Warner Cable. Charter will also own one-third of a new cable company to be spun off from Comcast. Maffei said the spin-off would be completed by the end of the year. It replaces a previous plan announced in March to split up the cable media assets into new companies, Liberty Broadband Group and Liberty Media Group.  The plan announced on Thursday will be a hard spin-off of Liberty Broadband, similar to how Liberty spun off television and movie channel Starz last year.  Liberty Broadband will house Liberty’s stake in Charter Communications, which was worth $3.31 billion as of March 31, as well as investments in Time Warner Cable and the small location technology company True Position Technologies Inc. Liberty Media will continue to hold stakes in Sirius XM and Live National Entertainment and remain the owner of the Atlanta Braves baseball team.  Liberty Media announced on Thursday that its first-quarter operating income before depreciation and amortization rose 12 percent to $294 million, compared to $262 million a year ago. Its shares were up almost 1 percent at $131.40 in early afternoon trade.

Charter will have a services agreement to help manage and provide technology to the company, which will pay a fee of about 4 percent of its revenue to Charter as part of the deal. Charter has to wait at least four years before it can gain ownership control of the company, however. Besides Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge, who will serve on the company’s board as nonexecutive chairman, no other board members have been announced yet.   (Reporting by Liana B.

165,CHTR,"TRLPC-Charter cuts loan size, increases pricing in choppy market","NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Cable company Charter Communications cut the size of its term debt and made lender friendly changes on Friday, driven by choppy market conditions, sources said. This is one of a batch of deals facing higher borrowing costs as investors balk at pricing levels due to growing volatility in the equity and high-yield markets. The changes to the credit come on the heels of a weakened secondary market, $1.5 billion of outflows from bank loan mutual funds and a record $7.1 billion in outflows from high-yield bond funds in the latest week ending Wednesday. “The large outflows are widening primary pricing,” said a loan investor. The company is now seeking a $3.5 billion, seven-year term loan to back its purchase of Time Warner Cable assets from Comcast, said sources. Formerly, the company was looking to seal $7.4 billion in term debt, split between a $3.2 billion, six-year first-lien term loan G and a $4.2 billion, seven-year first-lien term loan H. Charter is also in market for a $1 billion, five-year term loan A-2 and a $500 million incremental 3.5-year revolving credit, which are unchanged. Goldman Sachs, lead left on the transaction, declined to comment. Goldman is joined on the right by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. Loan sources predict that the rest of the credit facility will come to market after the Labor Day holiday. Price guidance on the now smaller term loan is being increased to LIB+350 with a 75 basis point (bp) Libor floor and a 99 original issue discount (OID). Earlier in the week, whispers were for a hike to LIB+325 with a 75bp Libor floor. The term loan G was initially guided at LIB+275-300 with a 75bp Libor floor and 99.5 original issue discount. Pricing for the term loan H was guided at LIB+275-300 with a 75bp Libor floor and a 99 OID. Call protection is being guided at 101 soft call for six months. Structural changes are also in the works, including MFN options and ticking fees, sources said. Formerly, ticking fees for the loans were 33 percent of margin for the first 45 days, 50 percent of margin for days 46 through 90 and 100 percent of margin 91 days or longer, sources said. Recommitments from lenders are due Monday. Charter’s asset purchase is tied to Comcast Corp’s $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable announced in February. Comcast, in a joint statement with Charter in April, said it would divest systems serving existing Time Warner Cable customers directly to Charter for cash.

166,CHTR,Charter weighs up options on Time Warner Cable financing,"NEW YORK, Aug 13 (TRPLC/IFR) - Charter Communications is expected to revisit the leveraged loan market as soon as September, and may also try to sell a high-yield bond, to raise the remaining US$3.9bn it needs to buy Time Warner cable assets. Charter more than halved the size of its senior secured institutional facility to US$3.5bn from US$7.4bn last Friday,  opted for a seven-year term loan rather than two term loans with different maturities and increased pricing. One leveraged finance banker close to the situation said the decision to cut the size of the deal was due to a combination of softer markets, and the issuer’s sensitivity around higher  financing costs following a pick-up in volatility shortly after the deal launched to investors. A repricing in the high-yield market has now fully filtered through to the loan market, the banker said. “The company doesn’t really need the money for six months so it can be patient,” the banker said. The cable giant is now considering its options to finance the rest of its acquisition of Time Warner Cable (TWC) subscribers, which rival Comcast is selling to help get regulatory approval for its planned US$45bn purchase of TWC . Those choices include revisiting the loan market or raising cash from a unsecured high-yield bond, most likely in the fall, the banker said. The hope is that the smaller deal size will make it more manageable to term out risk. “Banks like to underwrite deals like Charter because everyone wants to own cable,” said another leveraged finance banker. “Investors know the name, and it’s not a question of evaluating Charter risk.” Goldman Sachs is lead left on the transaction, joined by other bookrunners Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. Still, the deal’s struggle is a worrying sign as there are US$69bn of leveraged loans in the pipeline, according to Thomson Reuters LPC, and investors are certain to continue to make the most of the volatility by demanding higher prices on deals. Albertsons, for example, sweetened pricing on US$4.6bn of institutional term loans backing its acquisition of supermarket operator Safeway earlier this month. “Both are good deals,” said a loan investor, referring to Albertsons and Charter. “Investors just expect to be paid more.” The first banker said issuers would stay nimble, looking to tap either the loan or the bond market depending on what offers the best value in the weeks ahead. “The loan market has very strong technicals, driven by the CLO bid, but there is also a lot of supply. That could mean the bond market could find equilibrium faster than loans,” said the banker. “In this market, it’s all about finding a level.” Charter and Albertsons are not the only companies that are having to adjust to different pricing levels. On the loan side, a number of opportunistic deals have recently been pulled in response to volatility in the equity and high-yield markets. They include a US$380m financing backing a dividend recapitalization for packager HCP Global Limited, and repricing attempts for education technology company Blackboard and precision engineering firm SeaStar Solutions. Well services company Expro also reduced its deal to US$1.45bn, removed a delayed draw tranche and upped pricing. Bond deals for the buyout of Safeway and another for Jupiter Resources - backing Apollo’s acquisition of Encana’s Bighorn assets - have been pushed back to September. And another acquisition deal, for NCSG Crane & Heavy Haul Corp, not only priced a week later than expected but also came 200bp wide of whispers. One private equity source estimated capital costs had risen by at least 100bp over the past month - but said it really boils down to individual credits. Factors taken into account include the size of the deal, the length of commitment, ratings, and whether the credit is already known in the market, he said. The second banker stressed fairly aggressive deals are still getting done with structural changes that benefit investors such as extended call protections and Most Favored Nation clauses (MFN). The banker pointed to a loan and bond deal from BWAY which priced last week and partly financed a dividend to shareholders. “BWAY had very aggressive terms, but came unscathed. Will we be more careful? Absolutely. Does it mean we offer 101 protection for a year now? Probably. Add MFNs? Most likely,” said the banker. “Banks have to be careful and underwriters are under pressure but I’m not aware of anything disastrous that has been underwritten.” Some commitments, for the buyout of Acosta by Carlyle, for example, was only signed in the past month when markets were already choppy - showing banks are holding their nerve. The hope is that investors will now start to see value. The yield-to-worst on the high-yield index neared 6% last week, but has since retraced to 5.59%, according to the Barclays index. From a borrower’s perspective, funding costs remain cheap. “When you see that the yield on a bond is lower than the leverage on a deal you know that the market is frothy,” said another private equity source. “The market was well overdue for a correction.”       (Reporting by Natalie Harrison, IFR, and Lisa Lee and Michelle Sierra, TRLPC; Editing by Jonathan Methven)",8132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/charter-communi-loans/charter-weighs-up-options-on-time-warner-cable-financing-idUSL6N0QJ4RF20140813
167,CHTR,"Buffett's Berkshire reveals Charter stake, cuts DirecTV","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) disclosed a new  $366 million stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and pared its holdings in two other pay-TV companies, part of a flurry of changes in its stock investments during the second quarter. Shares of Charter shares rose about 2 percent after-hours after Berkshire reported a new 2.3 million share stake, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that detailed its domestic equity investments as of June 30. Charter is “the play of choice on cable consolidation,” said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan.  “You’ve got a good story on an as-is basis and if they do more deals they can do a lot more value,” he said. DirecTV DTV.O is awaiting regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T; (T.N) for $48.5 billion.     Charter declined to comment. A message left with DirecTV was not immediately answered. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new  investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him. Berkshire did not disclose whether the Charter investment was made by Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire’s larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), while other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with, are often made by Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest. Within the pay TV sector, Berkshire said its stake in DirecTV fell by about 11 million shares since the end of March to 23.5 million. It is also no longer reporting any stake in premium TV cable network Starz STRZA.O. The sales of stocks contributed to a significant increase during the quarter in Berkshire’s cash pile, which ended June at $55.5 billion. That gives Buffett power to make at least one big acquisition and still retain his desired $20 billion cushion. In Thursday’s filing, Berkshire reported a new stake in Now Inc (DNOW.N), an energy distribution business recently spun off from oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N), whose stock Berkshire also owns. Among the companies in which Berkshire reported higher share stakes were General Motors Corp (GM.N), IBM Corp (IBM.N), Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). It also reported lower holdings in many companies, including oil company ConocoPhillips (COP.N), former Washington Post owner Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N), National Oilwell Varco, and former Starz owner Liberty Media Corp LMCA.O. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window to their strategies for buying and selling stocks. Berkshire ended June with more than $119 billion of equities, about 90 percent of which are on U.S. exchanges. It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

The inspection comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a softer tone in comments regarding Ukraine. * In Iraq, Nuri al-Maliki stepped down as prime minister, paving the way for a new coalition that world and regional powers hope will be able to quash a Sunni Islamist insurgency that threatens Baghdad. * Investors awaited August data on both manufacturing and consumer sentiment.

Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures  added 50 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures  gained 14.5 points. * For the week, the Dow is up 1 percent, the S&P; is up 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq is up 1.9 percent. * The benchmark S&P; index is 1.7 percent off a closing record hit late July. In a sign of the market’s long-term strength, the index has marked more than 1,000 days since its last correction, which Wall Street defines as a drop of 10 percent from the most recent high. * Applied Materials Inc late Thursday reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations, boosted by demand for DRAM chips.

173,CHTR,Charter Savings to become third new UK bank since rule change,"LONDON (Reuters) - British startup lender Charter Savings Bank was cleared on Wednesday to start taking deposits as authorities try to encourage the formation of new banks to take on the dominant “big four”.  The award of a banking license to Charter Savings comes after Britain last year made it easier for new banks to launch, cutting the length of time it takes to apply for a license and lowering the amount of capital new banks must hold. The new bank’s parent company Charter Court Financial Services, was founded in 2008 and is majority-owned by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Associates. The Wolverhampton-based business employs 250 staff and will run Charter Savings Bank alongside its Exact and Precise mortgage brands.  Chief Executive Ian Lonergan told Reuters that the bank, which will save on start-up costs by not having branches, plans to take customers from bigger rivals by offering better rates. Many British savers have become disillusioned by the savings rates offered by established financial services firms. The bank will begin offering products including fixed rate bonds and savings accounts from March. “They will be pretty simple savings products but with very competitive rates. The incumbents don’t offer such great rates and our research tells us customers are prepared to move to challenger banks,” he said.  Lawmakers and regulators are keen to see challengers appear to break the grip of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC — which account for more than three-quarters of lending to individuals and small businesses. Some lawmakers say a lack of competition contributed to the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009 and subsequent scandals. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority was last year handed a new remit to promote competition within banking. Andrea Leadsom, a UK minister with responsibility for financial services policy, said moves to promote competition should take priority over increased regulation of the industry.  The appetite for new banks contrasts sharply with the attitude of regulators during the financial crisis. Minutes from meetings of Bank of England officials during the crisis which were published for the first time on Wednesday showed regulators had wanted fewer home loan providers. “Arguably there was an economic need for rationalization in the number of mortgage lenders –- the Bank should not be seen to be seeking to preserve the existing number of players in this market,” the minutes say. Charter Savings has become the third new bank to be granted a license since the new rules were introduced, following Paragon and Scoban.

174,CHTR,California Public Utilities Commission recommends to approve Comcast merger,"Feb 14 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp said on Friday that a California Public Utilities Commission Administrative (CPUC) law judge recommended  to approve its pending $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable and related transactions with Charter Communications. The approval, characterized by Comcast as an “important step” for the overall regulatory process, was proposed with a set of conditions, including making broadband available to un-served and under-served communities. Approval from California, the most populous U.S. state, is just one of a series of state and federal hurdles Comcast needs to clear to close the merger. Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen said the company was reviewing the proposed decision but that some of the recommended conditions “could prevent the full benefits of this transaction being realized by Californians, and create a more intrusive regulatory regime where innovative services could be hampered rather than helped.” In a statement, Cohen specifically cited the penetration rates and said the time frame related to making broadband more widely available to communities lacking service was “simply unattainable under market conditions.” “We look forward to working with the Commission as it creates conditions to approve this transaction that are fair to consumers in California and to our company,” he said. The overall approval of Comcast’s acquisition of Time Warner has been closely watched especially as regulators propose rules that adhere to net neutrality, or the notion that all internet providers should treat all web traffic equally. Comcast said it already has the vast majority of state and local approvals necessary to close the deal. It is working with the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice toward a close in early 2015.

The S&P;’s 500 quarterly winning streak was its longest since 1998, while the Nasdaq’s was its longest ever. The Dow registered a slight loss for the quarter. During the session, all 10 S&P; 500 sectors declined, with healthcare leading the way down. It dropped 1.5 percent, reversing strong gains from the previous day tied to deal activity. Energy shares also retreated, falling with crude oil. The S&P; Energy index declined 0.9 percent, while shares of Exxon Mobil Corp fell 0.7 percent to $85. Oil was pressured as Iran and six world powers continued talks on a nuclear deal that could see the energy-rich country increase oil exports.

180,CHTR,"US STOCKS-Wall St retreats but S&P;, Nasdaq post quarterly gains","* Oil prices weaken for third straight day * Charter to buy Bright House for about $10 bln * Nasdaq in longest-ever streak of quarterly gains * Dow down 1.1 pct, S&P; 500 down 0.9 pct, Nasdaq down 0.9 pct   (Updates to close) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended down on Tuesday in a retreat from the previous session’s sharp rally as energy shares declined and the dollar edged up, but the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq registered their ninth straight quarterly rise. The S&P;’s 500 quarterly winning streak was its longest since 1998, while the Nasdaq’s was its longest ever. The Dow registered a slight loss for the quarter. In the day’s action, energy shares were among the biggest drags as crude oil fell. The S&P; Energy index  declined 0.9 percent, while shares of Exxon Mobil Corp  fell 0.7 percent to $85. Oil was pressured as Iran and six world powers continued talks on a nuclear deal that could see the energy-rich country increase oil exports. The dollar added to its sharp gains for the quarter, stoking worries about earnings for U.S. multinationals. S&P; 500 earnings are expected to have declined by 2.8 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. “Today’s price action is a reflection of all the bad in the quarter - the stronger dollar, weaker oil - and in some respects just a snapback from yesterday’s outsized gains,” said John Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial in Boston. “Tomorrow’s a new quarter and there’s a new batch of people ready to take some risks, so I wouldn’t be surprised if we see an up day.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 200.19 points, or 1.11 percent, to 17,776.12, the S&P; 500 lost 18.35 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,067.89 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 46.56 points, or 0.94 percent, to 4,900.88. The day’s decline in stocks followed gains of more than 1 percent on each of the major indexes on Monday. All three indexes also posted losses for the month, with the Dow down 2 percent, S&P; 500 down 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq down 1.3 percent. For the first quarter, the Dow declined 0.3 percent, the S&P; 500 gained 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq gained 3.5 percent. Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd agreed to buy reinsurer Montpelier Re Holdings Ltd for about $1.83 billion, while Charter Communications Inc agreed to acquire Bright House Networks in a roughly $10 billion deal. Charter rose 5.3 percent to $193.11 while Montpelier rose 0.8 percent to $38.44. Endurance fell 4.9 percent to $61.14. March payrolls data are due Friday, when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday. If the report is strong, investors could view the U.S. Federal Reserve as more likely to raise rates earlier than currently expected. NYSE decliners outnumbered advancers 1,794 to 1,247, for a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,649 issues fell and 1,090 advanced, for a 1.51-to-1 ratio. The S&P; 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 72 new highs and 42 new lows.

182,CHTR,Charter beefs up cable muscle with Bright House deal,"(Reuters) - John Malone-backed Charter Communications Inc said it would buy Bright House Networks in a $10.4 billion deal as it expands its cable network after losing out to Comcast Corp in a fight for Time Warner Cable Inc. The U.S. cable TV industry has been rapidly consolidating in recent years to counter the growing popularity of satellite TV and Web-based entrants such as Netflix Inc. Comcast’s $45.2 billion offer for Time Warner Cable last year highlighted the changing landscape of the industry. If approved, the deal will cement Comcast’s No. 1 position and reshape the country’s pay TV and broadband markets. The Bright House deal will make Charter, in which Malone-controlled Liberty Broadband Corp is the biggest shareholder, the No. 2 U.S. cable TV provider. With Charter looking to close its gap with Comcast, the deal could be the first in a series of acquisitions. Analysts have cited Mediacom, CableOne and Suddenlink as potential targets for Charter. “I think it is inevitable most of the rest of the cable industry not owned by Comcast is sold to Charter,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak told Reuters. Wlodarczak also said Charter could go after Time Warner Cable if the Comcast deal fell through, the likelihood of which was roughly 20 percent. Charter’s shares rose as much as 8.5 percent to a record high of $199 on Tuesday. The company said it would pay Advance Newhouse — the owner of Bright House — $2 billion in cash and the rest in common and convertible preferred units of a new partnership created for the deal.   The deal will help Charter expand in Florida, a market where Bright House has a strong presence. Charter’s key markets include Alabama, Georgia, Michigan and California. Liberty Broadband said it would buy $700 million of newly issued shares of Charter.   After the deal closes, Advance Newhouse would likely own 26.3 percent of Charter and Liberty Broadband’s stake would slip to 19.4 percent. The deal is contingent on the expiration of Time Warner Cable’s “right of first offer” for Bright House, which has an agreement for sharing programming rates with the larger cable operator. Goldman Sachs and LionTree Advisors are financial advisers to Charter and UBS Investment Bank is adviser to Advance Newhouse. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is the legal adviser to Charter.

Energy shares will continue to be in focus as crude oil  fell 1.3 percent to $47.58 per barrel, sending Exxon Mobil Corp down 0.6 percent to $85.10 in premarket trading. Oil is set for its third straight daily decline, losing more than 7 percent in the three days. U.S. crude futures were volatile on Monday, swinging between a gain of 0.6 percent and a decline of 2.6 percent. On Tuesday, oil was pressured as Iran and six world powers entered a final day of talks on a nuclear deal that could see the energy-rich country increase oil exports.

Investors will also look ahead to the latest economic data, including the March Chicago Purchasing Managers Index at 9:45 a.m. EDT (1345 GMT) and a reading on March consumer confidence at 10 a.m. Confidence is seen dipping slightly in the latest month.

189,CHTR,UPDATE 3-Comcast looking to drop Time Warner Cable merger -source,"* Announcement could come as soon as Friday -source * FCC’s strong stance seen as big factor -sources * Senator Franken: Collapse would be “huge victory” for consumers   (Recasts with new sourcing; adds quote from advocacy group, background) By Liana B. Baker, Alina Selyukh and Diane Bartz NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, April 23 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp’s  board was meeting late on Thursday to finalize plans to abandon its proposed $45 billion merger with  Time Warner Cable Inc, according to a person directly familiar with the matter. An announcement is expected as early as Friday, the person added, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Representatives of Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment. The news came a day after officials of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest U.S. cable companies, met with reviewers at the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Comcast planned to drop its offer in the face of opposition from U.S. regulators. The Justice Department is weighing whether the deal hurts competition while the FCC is weighing whether it is in the public interest. Both agencies expressed concerns, though sources told Reuters it was the FCC’s strong stance that particularly tipped the scales to kill the deal. FCC reviewers told the agency staff at a Wednesday briefing that they planned to recommend taking the merger issue to an administrative law judge for a hearing, which would amount to the FCC blocking the deal. The FCC’s move is its latest flex of muscle under Chairman Tom Wheeler, who recently imposed the strictest-ever regulations on Internet providers and in 2014 helped scuttle a potential merger between wireless carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US. Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a public interest advocacy group, and an opponent of the deal, said Wall Street would now reconsider some aggressive deals. “I thought this was an uphill battle and a real long shot,” he said of opposition to the Comcast-TWC deal, indicating how the opposition’s apparent success would influence other deals. The Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal faced vocal criticisms from some politicians, media company executives and diverse public and industry groups, who worried it would create a massive monolith with too much control over what Americans do online and watch on TV. Though the two companies largely do not compete against each other, opponents have been drilling into the combined company’s broadband reach and raising concerns about its potential gate-keeping power over the online video market, among others. “If reports of the collapse of the deal are true, it would be a huge victory for American consumers.” said U.S. Senator Al Franken, a Democrat of Minnesota and a vocal opponent of the merger. “This transaction would create a telecom behemoth that would lead to higher prices, fewer choices and even worse service. We need more competition in this space, not less,” Franken said in a statement. Earlier this week, six senators sent a letter to the FCC urging that they reject the merger. If the deal falls through, investment bankers also look to suffer as they are worried about whether they will get paid, with smaller advisory firms particularly on edge. Last week, Bloomberg reported that attorneys at the Justice Department’s antitrust division were nearing a recommendation to sue to block the merger, citing concerns for consumers. Earlier, Charter Communications Inc had lost out to Comcast in a bid to acquire Time Warner Cable. A Charter spokesman had no comment on the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal or what Charter plans to do next. However, Charter’s controlling shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, has indicated continuing interest. At an investor day last November, when asked if he would pursue Time Warner Cable if the Comcast bid fell through, Liberty Media Chairman John Malone said, “Hell yes.” Greg Maffei, chief executive of Liberty Media, had no comment on Thursday. Shares of Comcast closed up 0.8 percent at $59.23 and Time Warner Cable closed down 0.6 percent at $148.76. Charter shares closed down 0.7 percent at $183.58.   (Reporting by Liana B.

The Nasdaq Composite added 0.71 percent to end at 5,092.09, its second straight record high close. The S&P; 500 rose 0.23 percent to a record high close of 2,117.69 points, barely above its previous high of 2,117.39 set on March 2. Amazon surged 14.13 percent to a lifetime high after revenue beat estimates. Google ended 2.9 percent after reporting higher quarterly results while Microsoft jumped 10.45 percent  after it topped estimates. The S&P; had hit an intraday high of 2,120.92. The Nasdaq earlier reached 5,100.371, the highest since its intraday record of 5,132.52 in March 2000 that marked the peak of the dot-com bubble. “This chapter that the Nasdaq is writing is more suggestive that it’s a market that, while still technology-weighted, is much more mature,” said Steven Baffico, chief executive officer at Four Wood Capital Partners in New York. “The companies in it reflect that, companies like Cisco and Microsoft.” Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Starbucks accounted for the bulk of the Nasdaq’s rise on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.45 points, or 0.12 percent, to 18,080.14. The S&P; 500 gained 4.76 points and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.02 points. For the week, the S&P; gained 1.8 percent, the Nasdaq gained 3.3 percent and the Dow added 1.4 percent. “This is a case of the equity market looking a little bit forward to oil being less of a drag going forward, and that earnings in the second half will be better than they are now,” said Anthony Valeri, an investment strategist for LPL Financial in San Diego. While markets are at record highs, March-quarter earnings of S&P; 500 companies are expected to dip 1.3 percent, with revenues dropping 3.5 percent as the dollar hurts U.S. multinationals and low oil prices affect energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters data. Xerox slumped 8.75 percent after it cut its 2015 profit forecast, blaming the strong dollar. Time Warner Cable jumped 4.37 percent on news Charter Communications Inc’s representatives reached out to begin discussions on a potential merger. Comcast earlier abandoned its proposed $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable. Apple could be among the biggest market drivers when it reports results after the bell on Monday.

The collapse of the deal opens the door for other possible offers for Time Warner Cable, but also casts heightened regulatory risk on merger activity in the U.S. cable industry, which has been rapidly consolidating in the face of competition from satellite TV and Web-based services. The proposed acquisition had faced criticism from some politicians, media company executives and consumer and industry groups, who had worried it would create a monolith with too much control over what Americans do online and watch on TV. Comcast had argued the merger would bring faster service and better video services to more Americans. “The pressure to consolidate in a very competitive industry is going to continue,” Maxim Group analyst John Tinker said. Charter Communications Inc lost out on a bid for Time Warner Cable last year, and Charter’s controlling shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, had since indicated continuing interest. “We believe that TWC will get a bid from Charter in the next three months, which we expect to be lower than the market expects,” Needham analysts said in a note. The analysts said they expected the opening bid at $130 to $135 per share. Time Warner Cable shares last traded at $152.52, up 2.5 percent on the day. Comcast shares were up 0.15 percent at $59.32 and Charter shares were down 0.8 percent at $182.18. ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONCERNS The Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would have created a company controlling almost 30 percent of the U.S. pay-TV subscribers, following promised divestitures, and would have provided high-speed Internet access to almost 40 percent of Americans, according to SNL Kagan data. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday that the merger would have posed an “unacceptable risk to competition and innovation.” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the companies’ decision to abandon the deal was “the best outcome for American consumers.” Comcast had argued that the Time Warner Cable deal would not be anti-competitive because the companies had no real geographic overlap. The company had also proposed to divest some assets to help address regulatory concerns. The collapse of the deal is a setback for Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts. “Today, we move on,” he said in a statement.

To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) Dow component Chevron Corp, the second-largest U.S. oil producer, is expected to report a drop in first-quarter profit as commodity prices slump. Cable company Charter Communications Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue below estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Reuters reported on Monday that Time Warner Cable was open to merger discussions with Charter. Investors will be interested in whether Charter, backed by activist investor John Malone, will make a second bid for Time Warner Cable. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is expected to report first-quarter results. The company is expected to benefit from growth in the U.S. economy, given Berkshire’s diversification with close to 90 operating businesses in areas such as insurance, energy, food, industrial products and a railroad. Berkshire also owns well over $100 billion in stock, with big stakes in American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. The company’s results will come a day before its annual meeting in Omaha, where shareholders will celebrate Buffett’s imminent 50th anniversary at Berkshire’s helm, and listen to him and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger answer questions from them, journalists and analysts. The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to report that construction spending rose 0.5 percent in March after slipping 0.1 percent in February. (1000/1400) The Institute for Supply Management is expected to report that its national factory index rose to 52 in April from 51.5 in March. (1000/1400) Automobile manufacturers are expected to report that sales moderated to a 16.9 million-unit rate in April after rising to a 17.15 million-unit rate in March. (1330/1730) Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester, who speaks on “Consumer Credit: Suggested Future Directions for Policy-Relevant Research” before the Conference on Regulating Consumer Credit in Philadelphia, will weigh in on the just-released FOMC statement, in which investors get a sense of how much the economy’s weak winter surprised policymakers. Toward the hawkish end of Fed officials, Mester could double down on her previous recommendation to hike rates in June. (0830/1230) San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams, a policy centrist with a vote this year on Federal Reserve interest rate policy, is among the first policymakers to speak after the Fed emerges from its self-imposed communications blackout following its April 28-29 meeting. Was the tone of that meeting dovish, hawkish or somewhere in between? The title of his speech at the Chapman University Conference in Orange, California, “Monetary Policy in Financial Markets: Is there a New Paradigm?” gives few hints, but he will be asked for his view of recent weak economic data and prospects of a rate hike in the coming months. (1545/1945) TransCanada Corp, Canada’s second-largest pipeline company, is scheduled to report first-quarter results. It reported a better-than-expected fourth quarter profit in February, driven mainly by increased earnings from its Canadian operations. Power company Duke Energy Corp is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by rising costs. The company is increasing reliance on natural gas and is retiring some coal plants to comply with U.S. environmental regulations. Lower income from the company’s operations outside North America has also weighed on profits in recent quarters. Investors will want to know about Duke’s expectations for its utilities holdings, demand and operations in markets other than North America. Drug chain CVS Health Corp will report first-quarter results before the markets open. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, the company will beat both profit and sales forecasts for the quarter. Credit rating agency Moody’s Corp is expected to report a rise in first-quarter profit, helped by strong growth in its analytics business and higher debt issuance in the United States. Analysts expect Moody’s to benefit from a rise in corporate bond refinancing cycle and diminishing regulatory risk. CBOE Holdings Inc, the operator of the largest U.S. stock options market, is set to report weak first-quarter results as volumes have been soft. Investors are waiting to hear the management’s projections for volumes for the remainder of the year. Tesla Motors Inc CEO Elon Musk is expected to announce details of a home electricity storage system built around Tesla batteries and take some questions. Tesla’s stock has risen in anticipation of the new effort to expand demand for Tesla batteries, which will be made at a factory in Nevada, and reap additional government clean power subsidies.

211,CHTR,Exclusive: Bright House Networks plans to drop merger with Charter - sources,"(Reuters) - Bright House Networks, the sixth largest U.S. cable operator, is preparing to abandon a $10.4 billion deal to be acquired by larger peer Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O), according to people familiar with the matter. Charter, the No. 4 U.S. cable operator, clinched the deal with Bright House in March contingent on completion of Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) $45.2 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N. Comcast walked away from the Time Warner Cable deal last month because of antitrust hurdles. Charter’s agreement with Bright House includes a 30-day provision for them to renegotiate a deal in this event. That period lapses in about two weeks. Even though negotiations are still formally continuing, Bright House, which is controlled by the Newhouse family, owner of magazine publisher Conde Nast, now believes it best to remain independent, the people said this week. Time Warner Cable has an agreement to negotiate programing rates for Bright House, as well as share technology, in exchange for a fee. Bright House would rather not change this arrangement by partnering with Charter, which is a smaller operator than Time Warner Cable, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Bright House Networks, Charter and Time Warner Cable representatives declined to comment. Last week, Charter Chief Executive Tom Rutledge said on the company’s earnings call he was negotiating with Bright House “in good faith.” Time Warner Cable has the right of first refusal in the event Bright House pursues a sale. The U.S. cable TV industry has been rapidly consolidating in recent years to counter the growing popularity of satellite TV and Web-based entrants such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). The Bright House deal would have made Charter, whose biggest shareholder is John Malone’s Liberty Broadband Corp, the No. 2 U.S. cable TV provider. It would have helped Charter expand in Florida, a market where Bright House has a strong presence. Charter’s key markets include Alabama, Georgia, Michigan and California. Charter is now in negotiations to acquire Time Warner Cable, people familiar with the matter have previously said. Time Warner Cable’s deal with Comcast fell through after U.S. regulators raised concerns that it would give Comcast an unfair advantage in the cable TV and Internet-based services market. Charter last week reported a first-quarter net loss of $81 million, or 73 cents per share, up from $37 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.

220,CHTR,Easier regulatory review seen for Altice vs Charter in TWC deal,"(Reuters) - A potential bid by French telecom group Altice SA to buy U.S. cable company Time Warner Cable Inc would pass regulatory hurdles more easily than an offer pondered by cable rival Charter Communications Inc , according to analysts and experts. Altice, controlled by French billionaire Patrick Drahi, on Wednesday agreed to buy regional U.S. cable company Suddenlink. It has also approached Time Warner Cable for a deal, according to people familiar with the talks. The moves come as Time Warner Cable, the second-largest U.S. cable provider, is being circled by smaller rival Charter after Comcast Corp, the biggest U.S. cable operator, failed to get government approval for a merger over concerns that it would control Internet access of too many Americans. Some analysts see regulatory hurdles for a possible Charter-TWC deal, especially after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler earlier this month said “more competition would be better” for cable companies providing broadband Internet. “Does the government want to create another Comcast?” BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield asked in a recent note on a possible Charter-Time Warner Cable merger. His answer leaned toward a no. A merger of Charter and Time Warner Cable, with other related deals, would eliminate one of the country’s top Internet providers and control more than 20 percent of the broadband market, according to data from MoffettNathanson.   Altice is a new entrant to the U.S. market. With Suddenlink, the seventh largest U.S. cable company, and Time Warner Cable, it would control less than 15 percent of the broadband market, according to the data. “To the extent that the Charter-Time Warner Cable deal raises regulatory concerns because they’re still one of the largest domestic broadband companies, Altice doesn’t bring any of that baggage,” said Harold Feld, a veteran telecom observer at consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. The Comcast-TWC deal would have created a behemoth Internet provider with roughly 40 percent of the U.S. high-speed Internet market. U.S. regulators have not commented specifically on any new potential deals. New Street Research analysts argue that Comcast’s failed merger does not portend broader regulatory opposition to cable consolidation, giving Charter an opportunity to offer online video protections to ease potential regulatory review. Plus, a combination of TWC with Charter would offer more cost savings, New Street’s Spencer Kurn said. “You’re combining two players with much greater scale and there’s more synergy value that you can create.” As a foreign company, Altice would face additional review from national security and telecommunications officials, which experts say could lead to criticism from opponents, but ultimately not pose a challenge.

224,CHTR,Charter Communications nears $55 billion deal for Time Warner Cable - sources,"(Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc is nearing an agreement to be acquired by smaller peer Charter Communications Inc for about $55 billion, combining the second and third largest U.S. cable operators, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. A deal would create a major rival to Comcast Corp, the biggest operator in the U.S. cable and broadband market, and marks a triumph for Charter, which was rejected by Time Warner Cable just last year. News of another potential merger comes as the traditional pay television industry faces stagnating growth and new competition from over-the-web rivals offering individual services, like Netflix, or packages of channels, such as Sony. A larger company in this sector could achieve greater economies of scale, including in negotiations with programmers. The cash-and-stock deal values Time Warner Cable at $195 per share, according to sources, and comes just one month after Comcast dropped its $45.2 billion merger agreement with Time Warner Cable, clinched in February 2014, over antitrust concerns. Time Warner Cable shares closed at $171.18 on Friday. That is up substantially from the day before the original Comcast deal was announced last year, when the shares closed at $135.31.  A merger of Charter and Time Warner Cable, with other related deals, would eliminate one of the country’s top Internet providers and control more than 20 percent of the broadband market, according to data from MoffettNathanson.

Any deal would be considered on its own merits, the paper quoted Wheeler as saying. One of the chief areas of concern for regulators in a merging industry is competition in Internet broadband. The deal is expected to be announced on Tuesday.  Charter will also acquire Bright House Networks, the sixth-largest U.S. cable operator, for $10.4 billion, the sources added. The combined companies could have as many as 23 million total customers, just behind Comcast’s 27.2 million customers.  Charter and Bright House had extended their merger talks after Comcast’s deal with Time Warner Cable fell through. Charter’s previous agreement with Bright House was contingent on Comcast’s completion of the buyout of Time Warner Cable. Media mogul John Malone, whose Liberty Broadband Corp is Charter’s largest shareholder, has advocated strongly for the deal, and Liberty is supporting the deal by acquiring $5 billion in new Charter stock, one of the people said. Charter Chief Executive Tom Rutledge is expected to be CEO of the combined entity. Charter was competing for Time Warner Cable against French telecommunications group Altice SA, which last week agreed to buy U.S. regional cable company Suddenlink Communications for $9.1 billion from private equity investors, making its first move across the Atlantic. The sources asked not to be identified ahead of any official announcement. Time Warner Cable declined to comment, while Charter, Bright House and Altice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Comcast did not have to pay a breakup fee when it ended its agreement to acquire Time Warner Cable last month. Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities, said he believes a Charter-Time Warner tie-up would have “a very high likelihood of passing muster with regulators” because the size of the combined company would not create the same anti-trust concerns regulators had about Comcast buying its smaller rival.

227,CHTR,Charter's Time Warner Cable bid faces $2 billion regulatory question,"WASHINGTON, May 26 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable, entering into talks to be acquired by  Charter Communications Inc just a month after regulators killed a proposed takeover by Comcast Corp’s, was determined not to get burned a second time. It won such an insurance policy on Tuesday, when Charter included as part of its $56 billion takeover agreement a pledge to pay Time Warner Cable a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal goes south. Comcast, by contrast, had made no such pledge and was able to walk away scot-free when its bid collapsed. Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Rob Marcus said in an interview that the company had more leverage to negotiate various terms of the deal with Charter because it was a competitive process. Reuters reported that French telecom company Altice had been in talks about buying the company as well. Time Warner Cable’s insistence on a breakup fee reflects lingering worries that the Federal Communications Commission, which rejected the Comcast deal over concerns about its broadband market reach and the future of online video, could do something similar in this case. Charter, meanwhile, was willing to pledge $2 billion because it is confident the deal will go through and it ultimately won’t have to pay the fee, according to people close to the company who declined to speak on the record. Underscoring the high stakes involved, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler issued an unusually quick statement when the new deal was announced on Tuesday, reiterating that the agency will review the deal to determine whether it is in the public interest. “In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient,” Wheeler said. “The Commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved.” While one FCC official noted that “absolutely nothing about this transaction has been pre-judged” and other experts warned against reading any implicit indications of opinion in the comment, some insiders saw Wheeler’s statement as a reason for concern. “That’s a shot across the bow,” said one antitrust expert and former FCC official, who asked not to be identified to protect business relationships. “If I were the parties, I wouldn’t like that statement.” Although the FCC and the Department of Justice will both review the merger proposal, the former will present a higher hurdle for Charter because of its broad public interest standard. The Justice Department reviews deals’ antitrust impact and has to prove actual harm to consumers to stop a merger. One issue of concern for regulators is whether the combination of Charter and Time Warner Cable will result in higher prices for cable and broadband, said Gene Kimmelman, a veteran of the Justice Department who is now president of the public interest group Public Knowledge. “It will get a hard look and it will depend on whether they will work out conditions,” he said, adding that conditions usually can be worked out in such deals. Other industry analysts said Charter’s deal would be viewed as less risky than that of Comcast because of its relatively smaller scale and lack of major content assets like Comcast’s NBC Universal. “This is a qualitatively different deal,” said Adonis Hoffman, former chief of staff to FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and founder of Business in the Public Interest think tank. Charter kicked off a charm offensive in the deal’s favor on Tuesday, pledging to invest more in faster broadband, public WiFi networks and high-speed Internet connections for small and medium-sized businesses. It also promised more affordable telephone service and better video products, including high definition channels. Still, Charter will face tough questions on the U.S. broadband Internet market, of which the combined companies would control more than one-fifth, according to data from research firm MoffettNathanson. Wheeler said the FCC’s review of a possible Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination led regulators to begin to consider cable companies less as traditional pay-TV providers and more as Internet service providers. The regulators are likely to seek reassurances that the new company would not harm the growing online content competition, for instance by charging high fees for access to its network, experts say. Charter currently does not charge such fees. “One of the biggest questions about Charter and Time Warner Cable is whether the deal is in the public interest. Frankly, we’re skeptical,” said Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports. “Prices for cable and broadband continue to go up, and customer service is dismal.” And, as with any cable or Internet deal, regulators will look to see if Charter and Time Warner systems overlap, and require asset sales in areas where they do before approving any deal. Both Time Warner Cable and Charter are strongest along the eastern United States with a smattering of customers in Texas and California, although they directly compete in few, if any of those markets.

228,CHTR,UPDATE 7-Charter's $56 bln Time Warner Cable deal to face U.S. scrutiny,"* Deal priced at $195.71/share * Including debt, bid valued at $78.7 billion * FCC says combination must benefit consumers * Broadband concentration likely to be focus of review * Time Warner Cable’s shares up 7.1 pct, Charter up 2.7 pct   (Adds commentary about likelihood of regulatory approval starting in paragraph 8) By Malathi Nayak and Diane Bartz NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, May 26 (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc, seeking to remake the U.S. cable television industry by acquiring larger rival Time Warner Cable Inc  for $56 billion, will try to skirt the regulatory obstacles that helped sink Comcast Corp’s earlier bid for Time Warner Cable. The combined company would control a big swath of the cable and Internet markets, marking a huge step toward industry consolidation, long advocated by cable pioneer John Malone, Charter’s biggest shareholder. But before that can happen, the Federal Communications Commission will “look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved,” said the agency’s chairman, Tom Wheeler. The agreement is the latest example of how cable companies are grappling with declining subscriber numbers as viewers shift to cheaper and more flexible streaming services offered by Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Hulu and others. Even premium cable network HBO, owned by Time Warner Cable’s former parent, recently started a stand-alone streaming service. Charter and others have been beefing up their higher-margin Internet businesses through consolidation and partnerships to  offset TV subscriber losses. That market power is likely to be regulators’ main focus.  The combined companies would control about one-fifth of the U.S. broadband Internet market, according to research firm MoffettNathanson. The merged company would still be smaller than Comcast, which serves about one-third of U.S. broadband users, said analyst Craig Moffett in a note to clients. He added that “one has to be sober about genuine risks that this deal could still be rejected.” Still, experts said the transaction is different enough from the scuttled Comcast takeover that it is likely to win regulatory approval with certain conditions. “This is a qualitatively different deal,” said Adonis Hoffman, former chief of staff to FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and a founder of Business in the Public Interest think tank. “The regulatory hurdles will be lower on this transaction primarily because you don’t have the same public interest concerns that you had with Comcast, in additional to a smaller total footprint across the nation. Time Warner Cable’s shares rose 7.3 percent to $183.60, still well below Charter’s $195.71 cash and stock offer. Charter shares rose 2.5 percent to close at $179.78. Executives from Charter and Time Warner Cable said concerns were overblown that the deal could face the same opposition as the Comcast takeover did. “It’s a smaller company so some of the concerns that were raised about potential abuses of a larger company don’t pertain here,” Time Warner Chief Executive Rob Marcus said in an interview. “It is also the case that we don’t have any of the other complications that arose out of Comcast being a vertically integrated media company with a broadcast network, a movie studio, a national cable network,” he said. Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports magazine, said on Tuesday that Time Warner Cable placed 16th out of 17 companies in its customer satisfaction survey, while Charter ranked 14th. Charter CEO Tom Rutledge, defending the quality of the company’s service in an interview, said its slowest Internet data speed was a swift 60 megabits per second, which it offers for $60 a month. Time Warner Cable’s “basic” tier is 10 megabits, initially priced at $30 a month, according to its website. Rutledge said the combined company would bring back customer service jobs to the United States that have been outsourced to offshore calling centers. “We plan to use in-house people to do service and transactions, and all that leads to higher quality, which actually reduces costs as your get better customer experiences,” he said. Comcast walked away last month from the deal to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, citing regulatory concerns. Now the pressure is on Malone, a 74-year-old billionaire dubbed the “King of Cable,” to show that he can complete a deal that slipped away from his larger rival. The Charter/Time Warner Cable deal would likely be approved by the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division but could face conditions at the Federal Communications Commission, said Gene Kimmelman, who worked at the Justice Department. “It’s more of an FCC focus and there they have still a heavy lift. Will cable prices go up? Will broadband prices go up?” said Kimmelman, now president of public interest group Public Knowledge. He added that the regulators’ review would also focus on developing Internet video competition. If the deal is blocked, Charter would be on the hook for a $2 billion break-up fee, the companies said. Malone, who in the 1980s built a small Denver cable company into the nation’s largest cable system, has been outspoken about the need for more consolidation. He said in 2013 that cable companies should team up to create a rival to Netflix, pooling their money to acquire the kind of content that would be too expensive for a single cable operator to acquire. As part of the complicated deal, Charter also wins control of Bright House Networks from Advance Newhouse for $10.4 billion. That would help Charter expand in Florida, a market where Bright House has a strong presence. A combined Charter-TWC would serve large clusters of subscribers in New York, Texas and California. Charter would have the size to undercut telecommunications companies in the lucrative data services market.

229,CHTR,Fitch: Charter Remains on Positive Watch on Time Warner Cable Merger,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 26 (Fitch) CCO Holding LLC's (CCOH) and Charter Communications  Operating, LLC's (CCO) 'BB-' Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) remain on Rating  Watch Positive following the announcement of the merger agreement today by  Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter) and Time Warner Cable, Inc. (TWC),  according to Fitch Ratings. Fitch placed CCOH and CCO's 'BB-' IDRs on Rating Watch Positive following the  April 2015 announcement of the acquisition of Bright House Networks, LLC (Bright  House) from Advance/Newhouse Partnership (A/N) for $10.4 billion. Following the  announcement that Comcast Corporation and TWC had terminated their merger  agreement, on May 18, 2015 Charter and A/N reaffirmed their commitment to  complete this deal under the same economic and governance terms. CCOH and CCO  are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Charter.  Fitch views the merger with TWC positively and believes it will strengthen  Charter's overall credit profile. Fitch anticipates that Charter's total  leverage, pro forma for both the TWC merger as it is currently structured and  the Bright House acquisition, would be 4.5x. Fitch notes that integration risks  are elevated and Charter's ability to manage the integration process and limit  disruption to the company's overall operations is key to the success of the  transactions. On a pro forma basis the combined company will serve 24 million customer  relationships and become the second largest cable multiple system operator in  the country. Pro forma revenues totalled approximately $36 billion during 2014  and EBITDA was approximately $13 billion. Charter's operating strategies are  having a positive impact on the company's operating profile resulting in a  strengthened competitive position. The market share-driven strategy, which is  focused on enhancing the overall competitiveness of Charter's video service and  leveraging its all-digital infrastructure, is improving subscriber metrics,  growing revenue and ARPU trends, and stabilizing operating margins. Charter's leverage as of the LTM ended March 31, 2015 was 4.4x excluding the  debt issued by CCOH Safari, LLC and CCO Safari, LLC. Management's leverage  target remains unchanged ranging between 4x and 4.5x. Fitch recognizes that a  large portion of the TWC transaction will involve senior secured debt, both  existing at TWC and new issuance. Depending on the ultimate capital structure, a  one or two notch upgrade could be possible provided that pro forma senior  secured leverage is at or below 4.0x and total leverage does not exceed 5.0x.  Resolution of the Rating Watch will largely be based on Fitch's review of  Charter's capital structure including assignment of potential equity credit to  the convertible preferred partnership units and an assessment of the risks  associated with Charter's ability to integrate the new cable systems from TWC  and Bright House. RATING SENSITIVITIES --Positive rating actions would be contemplated if the TWC merger and the Bright  House acquisition go forward as total leverage is expected to be 4.5x; --If the company demonstrates progress in closing gaps relative to its industry  peers on service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives; --Operating profile strengthens as the company captures sustainable revenue and  cash flow growth envisioned when implementing the current operating strategy; --Fitch believes negative rating actions would likely coincide with a leveraging  transaction or the adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that  increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan; --Adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy; --A perceived weakening of Charter's competitive position or failure of the  current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth  along with strengthening operating margins.

231,CHTR,Altice's ambitions for U.S. undimmed after Time Warner Cable setback,"* Charter agrees to buy Time Warner Cable in $56 bln deal * Altice aims to earn half of sales from U.S. one day * Cablevision, Cox, Mediacom could be targets - analysts By Leila Abboud PARIS, May 26 (Reuters) - Patrick Drahi, the billionaire owner of deal-hungry European telecoms group Altice, will not let missing out on Time Warner Cable dissuade him from further expansion in the United States, people familiar with the situation said. Taking his first step across the Atlantic last week by agreeing to buy Suddenlink cable group for $9.1 billion , Drahi also held early talks with Time Warner Cable and weighed a bid, sources had told Reuters. But the 51-year-old Franco-Israeli businessman was beaten to the finishing line by Charter Communications, backed by his mentor turned rival, cable tycoon John Malone. Charter has offered to buy Time Warner Cable for $56 billion, seeking to combine the No. 3 and No. 2 U.S. cable operators if regulators agree. Altice does not intend to submit a fresh offer for TWC, two sources said late on Monday. “There are plenty of other cable companies in the U.S. besides Time Warner, and Altice still intends to be a player in the coming consolidation in the U.S. market,” one of them said. But missing out on the big prize means that Altice could face a harder, more uncertain road in the United States, once the lines are redrawn by the latest deals, analysts said. Drahi will also have to move fast if he is to realise his mission set after the Suddenlink deal for Altice to one day earn half of its revenue in the United States. After buying Suddenlink, the seventh-biggest cable group in the United States, Altice will earn 12 percent of revenue from the market, with the rest coming from telecom and cable assets in France, Israel, Portugal and the Dominican Republic. Analysts said among the possible targets for Altice are Cox Communications, the fourth-largest U.S. cable group, which is in private hands; publicly traded, fifth-placed Cablevision  ; or privately held eighth-placed Mediacom. DEAL-MAKER Each target has strengths and weaknesses. Cox’s family owners may not be interested in selling, while heavily indebted Cablevision faces considerable competition from Verizon Communications’ fibre network in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and therefore is less profitable than some peers. Cablevision Chief Executive James Dolan said in early May he would be interested in a deal with another cable operator, but not telecom player Verizon. Altice shares dropped 6 percent to 123.10 euros at 1520 GMT, compared with a 1.1 percent fall for Europe’s telecom index . Craig Moffett, analyst at independent research firm MoffettNathanson LLC, said in a note Altice would need to hurry to bid on something since Suddenlink “on a standalone basis simply isn’t compelling enough, at least at the price Altice paid for it”. Suddenlink has 1.2 million subscribers in the south and midwest regions, and Altice has the aim of stripping some $215 million in annual cost reductions out of the company. “To achieve their targeted 50-50 portfolio mix between U.S. and non-U.S. holdings, Altice would need to virtually run the table and buy half of everything out there that isn’t named Comcast or Charter,” Moffett said. “If one assumes that Cox isn’t a seller (they’re the largest remaining company after TWC and Charter itself, and they have sounded relatively resolute in their desire to remain independent) then Altice would need to successfully buy essentially everyone else.” “Altice will never amount to much more than a distant, distant third. Very likely, they too will be long term sellers to Charter,” Moffett concluded. Others think it is too early to write off Drahi, who has surfed a wave of cheap debt to turn Altice into a serial acquirer since going public in January 2014. Last year alone, the group used its French cable company Numericable to take over the country’s second largest mobile carrier SFR, as well as snapping up Portugal Telecom  and another operator in the Dominican Republic. “This is not the end of the road for Altice in the United States,” said Emmanuel Carlier, analyst at ING who has a buy rating on Altice. “The company would not have bought Suddenlink without having the next steps in their heads. If it cannot get TWC, then it will probably buy other players but it will take a few years to carry out.” ",5262015,http://www.reuters.com/article/twc-ma-charter-communi-altice/altices-ambitions-for-u-s-undimmed-after-time-warner-cable-setback-idUSL5N0YH33T20150526

The dollar was hovering at an eight-year high against the yen and a one-month peak against a basket of other big currencies. “A strong dollar is going to hurt exports and the revenue line of companies, which wasn’t strong to begin with,” said Rick Fier, director of trading at Conifer Securities in New York. The overall economy is gradually firming, with reports on Tuesday showing business investment spending plans increasing solidly in April, consumer confidence perking up this month and house prices extending gains in March. The buoyant data comes after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Friday that the central bank could raise interest rates this year if the economy keeps improving as expected. The comments kept the likelihood of a September rate increase high. Yellen’s comments and the dollar’s rise pushed the monthly gain for each of the three major U.S. stock indexes to below 2 percent in the past two trading sessions. At 11:01 a.m. ET (1501 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 183.94 points, or 1.01 percent, at 18,048.08, the S&P; 500 was down 20.4 points, or 0.96 percent, at 2,105.66 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 57.53 points, or 1.13 percent, at 5,031.83. All 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower in early trading, with the materials index’s 1.24 percent fall leading the way. Apple fell 1.2 percent to $130.88 and was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. Charter Communications’ shares were down 0.8 percent to $174.15 after it agreed to buy Time Warner Cable  for $55.8 billion. Time Warner Cable rose 3.9 percent to $177.99, well below Charter’s cash and stock offer of $195.71. First Solar fell 7.5 percent, the biggest on the S&P;, to $50.91 after RBC downgraded the solar panel maker’s stock to “underperform” from “sector perform”. LivePerson shares were up 13 percent at $10.11 after an Israeli website reported software provider Nice Systems  was in talks to acquire the chat software firm. Nice was down 3.7 percent at $62.64.

That was followed by data that showed single-family home prices in the United States rose more than expected in March from a year earlier, led again by strong increases in the western half of the country.

The deal values each Time Warner Cable share at about $195.71 based on Charter’s closing price on May 20, the companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

236,CHTR,Charter-Time Warner Cable deal could spawn an online video service,"NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc  executives are exploring whether to launch an online video service as part of its combination with larger rival Time Warner Cable Inc, in what would be an unprecedented move in the cable industry. The $56 billion takeover announced on Tuesday would make Charter the No. 2 U.S. Internet and cable company after Comcast Corp. Charter’s top shareholder John Malone, a cable industry pioneer, is on record as being a fan of streaming TV over the Internet. And Tom Rutledge, who would run the combined Charter-Time Warner Cable, has now opened the door to establishing the cable industry’s first competitor to services like Netflix Inc  and Hulu. “We’re certainly exploring that thought,” Charter CEO Tom Rutledge said in an interview on Tuesday. “But whether you can put an over-the-top product together today with the existing services that are in cable and make that work is unclear to us. It’s certainly something of interest.” The development of Charter’s video technology in recent years, which includes a shift to cloud-based systems, also make it a likely move, analysts say. New Street Research analyst Spencer Kurn said that Charter executives want to avoid the opposition faced by Comcast, which dropped its own Time Warner Cable bid after regulators expressed concern that the combined entity would stifle competition by gaining the largest market share in broadband and video streaming. “Charter is going to be very proactive in helping that market emerge,” he said. “Even since the Comcast deal broke, they’ve been more vocal about over-the-top,” Companies from Sony Corp to Dish Network Corp  have launched online video, or “over-the-top” services. Apple Inc, which already sells an Internet TV device, has been talking to CBS Corp and others about an enhanced product that would more directly compete with cable operators. Cable companies such as Comcast have not yet launched their own Internet television services, in part over concern that it could threaten their existing pay-TV businesses that are seeing margins shrink. But Malone, chairman of Charter’s largest investor Liberty Media Corp, suggested less than two years ago that cable companies should team up to take on Netflix. “It’s very clear (Rutledge has) seen the writing on the wall and that Liberty and John Malone are giving him lots of advice about chasing where customers are, which is increasingly online,” nScreenMedia analyst Colin Nixon said. Rutledge talked in a recent Charter earnings call about his interest in offering online video content directly to its cable customers and creating smaller, cheaper channel packages as opposed to fully loaded cable and satellite TV bundles. Charter already has the technology and infrastructure to support an online video service, according to Igor Ulis, chief executive of digital consulting firm Omnigon. The company has the technology to store video and meter video consumption to bill customers, said Ulis, who helps companies build online video products and does not work with Charter. An online video service from Charter could be somewhat similar to satellite operator Dish’s Sling TV, which offers a fixed set of basic channels at $20 a month, Nixon said. Like Dish, Charter could go after its existing customer base as well as younger viewers who prefer consuming content online, analysts say. “The challenge about going to existing subscribers is you run the risk of cannibalizing,” Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said. “They will try to find a way to make it an incremental experience.” Charter would probably take some time to “digest this deal” before exploring online video, Wi-Fi services or other acquisitions, New Street’s Kurn said.

237,CHTR,Charter expects IG rating for secured debt funding TWC bid,"NEW YORK, May 27 (IFR) - Charter Communications said in an SEC filing on Wednesday that secured debt to be issued to finance its planned merger with Time Warner Cable would be rated investment-grade by two out of the three main rating agencies. The company said it expects to maintain a ratio of secured debt to adjusted EBITDA of the combined companies at about 3.5x. The secured portion of the expected US$31bn financing backing the deal will comprise of loans and bonds. Charter said the secured bonds would be eligible for investment grade indices. Charter announced on Tuesday a new bid to merge with Time Warner Cable and acquire Bright House Networks. The deal - the largest cable M&A; deal since records began in 1980, and sixth largest US M&A; deal on record, according to Thomson Reuters data - values TWC at US$78.7bn including debt and US$56bn without.

238,CHTR,RPT-Charter's Time Warner Cable bid faces $2 billion regulatory question,"(Repeats for more subscribers; no change to text) By Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, May 26 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable, entering into talks to be acquired by  Charter Communications Inc just a month after regulators killed a proposed takeover by Comcast Corp’s, was determined not to get burned a second time. It won such an insurance policy on Tuesday, when Charter included as part of its $56 billion takeover agreement a pledge to pay Time Warner Cable a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal goes south. Comcast, by contrast, had made no such pledge and was able to walk away scot-free when its bid collapsed. Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Rob Marcus said in an interview that the company had more leverage to negotiate various terms of the deal with Charter because it was a competitive process. Reuters reported that French telecom company Altice had been in talks about buying the company as well. Time Warner Cable’s insistence on a breakup fee reflects lingering worries that the Federal Communications Commission, which rejected the Comcast deal over concerns about its broadband market reach and the future of online video, could do something similar in this case. Charter, meanwhile, was willing to pledge $2 billion because it is confident the deal will go through and it ultimately won’t have to pay the fee, according to people close to the company who declined to speak on the record. Underscoring the high stakes involved, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler issued an unusually quick statement when the new deal was announced on Tuesday, reiterating that the agency will review the deal to determine whether it is in the public interest. “In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient,” Wheeler said. “The Commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved.” While one FCC official noted that “absolutely nothing about this transaction has been pre-judged” and other experts warned against reading any implicit indications of opinion in the comment, some insiders saw Wheeler’s statement as a reason for concern. “That’s a shot across the bow,” said one antitrust expert and former FCC official, who asked not to be identified to protect business relationships. “If I were the parties, I wouldn’t like that statement.” Although the FCC and the Department of Justice will both review the merger proposal, the former will present a higher hurdle for Charter because of its broad public interest standard. The Justice Department reviews deals’ antitrust impact and has to prove actual harm to consumers to stop a merger. One issue of concern for regulators is whether the combination of Charter and Time Warner Cable will result in higher prices for cable and broadband, said Gene Kimmelman, a veteran of the Justice Department who is now president of the public interest group Public Knowledge. “It will get a hard look and it will depend on whether they will work out conditions,” he said, adding that conditions usually can be worked out in such deals. Other industry analysts said Charter’s deal would be viewed as less risky than that of Comcast because of its relatively smaller scale and lack of major content assets like Comcast’s NBC Universal. “This is a qualitatively different deal,” said Adonis Hoffman, former chief of staff to FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and founder of Business in the Public Interest think tank. Charter kicked off a charm offensive in the deal’s favor on Tuesday, pledging to invest more in faster broadband, public WiFi networks and high-speed Internet connections for small and medium-sized businesses. It also promised more affordable telephone service and better video products, including high definition channels. Still, Charter will face tough questions on the U.S. broadband Internet market, of which the combined companies would control more than one-fifth, according to data from research firm MoffettNathanson. Wheeler said the FCC’s review of a possible Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination led regulators to begin to consider cable companies less as traditional pay-TV providers and more as Internet service providers. The regulators are likely to seek reassurances that the new company would not harm the growing online content competition, for instance by charging high fees for access to its network, experts say. Charter currently does not charge such fees. “One of the biggest questions about Charter and Time Warner Cable is whether the deal is in the public interest. Frankly, we’re skeptical,” said Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports. “Prices for cable and broadband continue to go up, and customer service is dismal.” And, as with any cable or Internet deal, regulators will look to see if Charter and Time Warner systems overlap, and require asset sales in areas where they do before approving any deal. Both Time Warner Cable and Charter are strongest along the eastern United States with a smattering of customers in Texas and California, although they directly compete in few, if any of those markets.

239,CHTR,RPT-Charter-Time Warner Cable deal could spawn an online video service,"(Repeats story published on Wednesday; no changes to text) By Malathi Nayak NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc  executives are exploring whether to launch an online video service as part of its combination with larger rival Time Warner Cable Inc, in what would be an unprecedented move in the cable industry. The $56 billion takeover announced on Tuesday would make Charter the No. 2 U.S. Internet and cable company after Comcast Corp. Charter’s top shareholder John Malone, a cable industry pioneer, is on record as being a fan of streaming TV over the Internet. And Tom Rutledge, who would run the combined Charter-Time Warner Cable, has now opened the door to establishing the cable industry’s first competitor to services like Netflix Inc  and Hulu. “We’re certainly exploring that thought,” Charter CEO Tom Rutledge said in an interview on Tuesday. “But whether you can put an over-the-top product together today with the existing services that are in cable and make that work is unclear to us. It’s certainly something of interest.” The development of Charter’s video technology in recent years, which includes a shift to cloud-based systems, also make it a likely move, analysts say. New Street Research analyst Spencer Kurn said that Charter executives want to avoid the opposition faced by Comcast, which dropped its own Time Warner Cable bid after regulators expressed concern that the combined entity would stifle competition by gaining the largest market share in broadband and video streaming. “Charter is going to be very proactive in helping that market emerge,” he said. “Even since the Comcast deal broke, they’ve been more vocal about over-the-top,” Companies from Sony Corp to Dish Network Corp  have launched online video, or “over-the-top” services. Apple Inc, which already sells an Internet TV device, has been talking to CBS Corp and others about an enhanced product that would more directly compete with cable operators. Cable companies such as Comcast have not yet launched their own Internet television services, in part over concern that it could threaten their existing pay-TV businesses that are seeing margins shrink. But Malone, chairman of Charter’s largest investor Liberty Media Corp, suggested less than two years ago that cable companies should team up to take on Netflix. “It’s very clear (Rutledge has) seen the writing on the wall and that Liberty and John Malone are giving him lots of advice about chasing where customers are, which is increasingly online,” nScreenMedia analyst Colin Nixon said. Rutledge talked in a recent Charter earnings call about his interest in offering online video content directly to its cable customers and creating smaller, cheaper channel packages as opposed to fully loaded cable and satellite TV bundles. Charter already has the technology and infrastructure to support an online video service, according to Igor Ulis, chief executive of digital consulting firm Omnigon. The company has the technology to store video and meter video consumption to bill customers, said Ulis, who helps companies build online video products and does not work with Charter. An online video service from Charter could be somewhat similar to satellite operator Dish’s Sling TV, which offers a fixed set of basic channels at $20 a month, Nixon said. Like Dish, Charter could go after its existing customer base as well as younger viewers who prefer consuming content online, analysts say. “The challenge about going to existing subscribers is you run the risk of cannibalizing,” Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said. “They will try to find a way to make it an incremental experience.” Charter would probably take some time to “digest this deal” before exploring online video, Wi-Fi services or other acquisitions, New Street’s Kurn said.

243,CHTR,TRLPC: Record M&A; fuels investment grade loan issuance,"NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - Huge takeovers by companies including cable operator Charter Communications Inc and chipmaker Avago Technologies promise to propel merger and acquisition loan volume from strong to certifiably robust as deals were announced at a record-breaking pace in May. Leveraged deals are taking a backseat to investment grade deals, however, as corporations with strong balance sheets and huge amounts of cash on their books are beating out sponsors already burdened by the constraint of leveraged lending guidance that has limited leverage to around 6.0 times on most deals. Industry insiders expect both leveraged and investment grade M&A; activity to remain strong throughout the remainder of the year, with demand for debt outweighing supply despite the rash of new deals. “There’s a lot of capital chasing the loan side of these deals,” said George Tetler, a partner at Bowditch & Dewey, referring to debt investors. Companies in the United States announced $245.2 billion of mergers and acquisitions in May, breaking the all-time record of $225.8 billion for monthly M&A; volume set in May 2007, according to data from Dealogic. So far this year volume in the United States has reached $825.8 billion, compared to $542.1 billion in the same period last year. M&A; activity has boosted volume in a market that until the second quarter of the year was virtually void of refinancing activity. Total completed M&A; loan volume is $176.5 billion year-to-date compared to $163.5 billion at this time last year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. Another $96.2 billion is in the pipeline, led by Charter, which is arranging approximately $32 billion of loans to fund its acquisitions of fellow cable operators Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. Avago said it plans to arrange $15.5 billion of loans to back its purchase of rival Broadcom Corp, including $9 billion of new money and $6.5 billion of refinancing debt. Avago is a leveraged deal while Charter has said it anticipates netting an investment grade rating on its secured debt. This week, another chipmaker - Intel, the world’s biggest - agreed to buy Altera for $16.7 billion, the third big deal this year in the highly fragmented chip industry. Charter is the largest M&A; financing of the year so far, followed by a pair of other investment grade transactions. Drugmaker Abbvie lined up an $18 billion bridge loan to support its $21 billion acquisition of pharmaceutical company Pharmacyclics in March for the second-largest deal. Drugstore CVS Caremark Corp arranged a $13 billion bridge loan to finance its $12.7 billion purchase of pharmacy services provider Omnicare.  PIPELINE BOOST Investment grade deals have made up 41.5 percent of completed M&A; financing this year, and this number jumps to 50.3 percent including deals in the pipeline. Last year at this time, investment grade deals made up just 35.8 percent of total volume. “On the investment grade side, people had been waiting for the floodgates to open for a while, and fairly clearly they have now opened,” said Jason Kyrwood a partner at Davis Polk, adding the deals tend to come in waves by sector, from food companies last year to pharma and healthcare to telecom. Cross-border deals have also become more prevalent. It does not look like M&A; activity is ready to slow down yet. “The chatter I am hearing suggests that the pipeline remains robust, with a few nice larger transactions still to come,” Kyrwood said, referring to both leveraged and non-leveraged deals. In particular, Tetler noted that General Electric Co’s decision to sell most of financial services unit GE Capital should spur M&A; activity in the financial services sector throughout the remainder of the year, as GE sells off the unit in pieces.

247,CHTR,Charter lists consumer benefits to win merger approval,"(Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) formally argued for regulatory approval for its Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and Bright House Networks deals, saying consumers would benefit as Internet services would become cheaper and faster. Charter said in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday that it would not block or suppress Internet traffic or prioritize content for a fee and that its broadband services would cost less than the current offerings of Time Warner (TWC) and Bright House.  In its first official argument in support of the deals, Charter also said the new company would not harm online video services providers as its success would depend on the broadband business rather than on video services. Charter would invest at least $2.5 billion in commercial areas and deploy over 300,000 out-of-home WiFi access points, according to the filing.

The proposed deals mark a huge step towards industry consolidation, long advocated by cable pioneer John Malone, Charter’s biggest shareholder, as the new company would control a big swath of the cable and Internet markets.

249,CHTR,DEALS-Second-quarter M&A; close to record amid mega deals,"NEW YORK/LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) worldwide in the second quarter of 2015 almost matched the record set in the second quarter of 2007, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data, as big companies turned to deals to boost their market share. Low interest rates and stronger confidence among chief executives have led to a steady rise in M&A; activity in the last two years to close to pre-2008 financial crisis levels. The second quarter of 2015, however, stands out for the number of mega deals that were clinched or attempted. These include Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s $70 billion acquisition of British rival BG Group Plc, cable operator Charter Communications Inc’s $78.7 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc, and chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd’s $37 billion acquisition of peer Broadcom Corporation. Such large deals drove M&A; volumes globally in the second quarter of 2015 up by 34.6 percent year-on-year to $1.33 trillion as of June 26, shy of the record $1.41 trillion seen in the second quarter of 2007. “Given the consolidation that is going on across numerous sectors, to be a bystander could mean losing ground from a competitive standpoint,” said Gary Posternack, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Barclays Plc. “Companies are mapping out their industry landscapes, focusing on transactions that could position themselves as industry leaders, and acting aggressively to try to bring them to fruition,” Posternack added. Consolidation was often sparked by one company exploring a sale and spurring its rivals into action. In the United States, for example, health insurer Humana Inc’s decision to put itself on the block prompted peers Cigna Corp, Aetna Inc , Anthem Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc  to also explore other deals. To be sure, there were several takeover approaches in the quarter that were rebuffed. Cigna has so far snubbed Anthem’s $53.8 billion acquisition proposal, natural gas pipeline company Williams Companies Inc rejected a $53.1 billion offer from peer Energy Transfer Equity LP, and generic drug maker Mylan NV is resisting a roughly $50 billion bid by  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, while also seeking to acquire rival Perrigo Company Plc in a hostile $35 billion bid. “The public markets have become more receptive to companies taking control of another company in a transformational way, even when the target may be reluctant to sell or merge,” said Robin Rankin, global M&A; co-head at Credit Suisse Group AG . A major difference between the recent M&A; boom and that  seen in 2007 is that the latter was to a large extent fueled by private equity-backed leveraged buyouts, as opposed to this year’s strategic corporate deals. In fact, the first half of 2015 has seen the slowest six-month period for private equity-backed acquisitions since 2012. “For private equity investors, one of the main issues is the limited supply of assets. They have money to put to work but it proves hard for them to compete against industry players or new money pools in fiercely competitive auctions,” said Luigi Rizzo, head of M&A; for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Corp Despite the near-record M&A; volumes, and the frothy valuations that have accompanied them, dealmakers say companies that see a strong strategic rationale remain committed to acquisitions. “When you are in the boardroom, discussion is not generally focused on whether we are in a bubble or not, or how long will this M&A; trend continue. The discussion is rather about fundamentals, what is happening to operations and how much is the business worth,” said Stephen Arcano, M&A; head at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. M&A; volumes jumped in all three regions. More companies showed appetite for cross-border dealmaking, with U.S. agrochemicals company Monsanto Co launching a bid for Switzerland’s Syngenta AG, and Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc going after German peer K+S AG . “Buyers are looking for growth and borders do not represent obstacles. If they can buy something in emerging markets, developed Asia or in Europe, that is consistent with their strategy, that will be what they want to do,” said Bob Eatroff, Americas M&A; co-head at Morgan Stanley. Macro-economic concerns such as Greece’s debt crisis and China’s interest rate policies did not dampen M&A; sentiment in Europe and Asia in the second quarter. Dealmakers say this could change if concerns over Greece or other issue curb risk taking. “The market backdrop in Europe could be described as a form of surreal stability; markets are favorable, but there are potential risks on the horizon which may not yet have been factored in,” said Robert Leitão, head of Rothschild’s global financial advisory team.

250,CHTR,Charter close to pulling trigger on M&A; bond: sources,"NEW YORK, July 8 (IFR) - Charter Communications could hit the high-grade market Thursday with a much-anticipated multi-billion dollar M&A; bond for Time Warner Cable if conditions are stable, two buyside sources said. Worries about China and Greece have kept issuance down in recent days, but signs of some stability tomorrow morning could get Charter off the sideline, they said. The high-grade bond is part of an expected US$31bn funding plan that also includes issuance of high-yield bonds and bank debt to help fund the US$56bn acquisition. “The investment-grade (portion) is expected tomorrow, the high-yield maybe next week,” said one of the sources, each of whom took part in investors calls with Charter this week. “But (the high-yield bond) does not have to come (yet). So that can be tabled until the market is stronger.” The go/no-go decision tomorrow morning would depend on the tone in the broader markets, with buyside and sellside alike watching the Greek debt standoff and China’s stock market rout. Syndicate bankers say that, despite those woes, investor appetite for quality paper remains strong. Charter’s merger with TWC will combine the fourth and second-largest cable players in the US. The cable M&A; deal would be the largest of its kind since records began in 1980, and the sixth-largest US M&A; deal on record, according to Thomson Reuters data, valuing TWC at US$78.7bn including debt and US$56bn without. Charter initially said it had lined up commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and UBS when it announced details of the planned acquisition in May.

The company added 70,000 Internet subscribers in the second quarter ended June 30, up about 43 percent from a year earlier. Charter’s shares rose as much as 2.6 percent on Tuesday, reversing course. Revenue from the company’s Internet business, its second largest, rose 16.5 percent to $743 million, accounting for about a third of its total revenue. JP Morgan analysts had expected Charter to add 60,000 Internet subscribers in the quarter. “ ...

Cable companies have been struggling with declining subscriber numbers as viewers shift to cheaper and more flexible streaming services offered by Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Hulu and others. Charter’s net loss widened to $122 million, or $1.09 per share, from $45 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier, due to costs related to debt extinguishment and the failed deal between Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc . Charter’s deal to buy some assets of Time Warner Cable fell through after U.S. regulators refused to clear Comcast’s $45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable. Charter took a $128 million loss on debt extinguishment and $45 million in costs related to the Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks LLC deals.

Berkshire also appeared to have shed its stakes in oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N) and refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) in the second quarter, as the oil industry struggles with falling prices. The changes were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing Berkshire’s $107.2 billion U.S. stock portfolio on June 30.

The SEC sometimes lets the Omaha, Nebraska-based company delay disclosures of new stakes so Buffett can build them quietly, rather than have investors piggyback on him before he finishes. Friday’s filing suggests that only a small percentage of the $3.09 billion of stock that Berkshire bought in the quarter went to companies it already owned. Berkshire held 8.51 million shares of Charter worth $1.46 billion on June 30, up from 5.98 million shares on March 31. It also confirmed its purchase of 20 million shares, or 8.7 percent, of paint maker Axalta Coating Systems Ltd (AXTA.N) from controlling shareholder Carlyle Group LP (CG.O).

264,CHTR,TRLPC: Stronger US credits to benefit from flight to quality,"NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Big issuers of US leveraged loans including cable company Charter Communications Inc  and chipmaker Avago Technologies will test the US leveraged loan market by launching jumbo deals after the Labor Day holiday, but could benefit from a flight to quality after global equity market turmoil. Investors are expected to favor large liquid deals for highly-rated companies as they become more selective about deals that they are willing to hold on their books in a ‘risk off’ environment as China’s stock market crash and slumping commodities prices exacerbate fears of increasing default rates. “I believe there’s a higher degree of uncertainty right now driven by a combination of historically low commodity prices and equity market volatility plus what happens with interest rates,” said Kevin Lockhart, global co-head of leveraged finance at Jefferies. Wider market volatility usually pushes secondary prices lower, and average secondary bids on the SMi100 index of most widely held loans dropped to 98.71 at the start of September from 99.62 on July 21. This typically prompts a pricing correction in the primary market as investors call for higher pricing or discounts and improved terms, including adding or boosting call protection and adding most favored nation clauses. Charter and Avago have jumbo multi-billion dollar acquisition loans to launch after Labor Day, despite launching smaller deals before the holiday to minimize execution risk on the larger financings in light of market turmoil. These jumbo loans could be less affected by typical market dynamics, however, due to low dealflow this year in the US leveraged loan market and continued demand from deal-hungry investors as new Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) funds, the main buyers of loans, have continue to be issued. US leveraged volume was just US$559bn at the end of August for the year to date, 19% lower than US$689bn in the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. “It feels like pricing should widen a bit, but that is offset by the combination of CLO creation and the fact that year over year volume is low,” Lockhart said. The volume of deals launching after Labor Day is unlikely to change excess demand, which will continue to favor borrowers with strong credit profiles, another banker said. This means that Charter and Avago’s bellwether deals may still be able to achieve competitive pricing, although smaller, less liquid deals are expected to see more revision. “The top tier of credits is probably going to be on par with pricing earlier this year and may be slightly tighter on occasion because everyone is going to be chasing quality.” Lockhart said. PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKES Charter and Avago launched smaller deals in July and August to reduce the size and risk of the remaining loans that they need to raise. Investors were supportive and both deals were increased from original targets. Charter increased a term loan H financing to US$3.8bn from US$3.5bn on July 22, which part-finances its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks LLC, which total US$78.7bn. The company still has commitments to issue a further US$5.2bn of debt to help finance the acquisitions. Avago increased a term loan A to US$4.25bn from US$3.25bn on August 14, which also part-financed its US$37bn acquisition of rival Broadcom Corp. The company said that it plans to line up a total of US15.5bn to finance the deal, leaving more than US$10bn to raise. Avago will use US$9bn of loans to finance the acquisition and US$6.5bn will refinance debt. Charter and Avago’s follow-on deals are expected to be well received by investors, a senior banker said, adding that deals at the lower end of the credit spectrum will not find as much interest from investors. Demand for riskier lower-rated deals and subordinated second lien loans has fallen in the recent market rout. Many buyers were crossover high-yield investors and deals with second-lien debt are now being restructured with bonds when possible. Private equity firms and alternative lenders may also buy second lien tranches if they are small enough. Bankers still expect September to be busy due to continued mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) activity with deals in the pipeline including a financing backing fashion department store operator Belk Inc’s US$3bn buyout by Sycamore Partners, which has commitments from nine banks. The current round of equity market volatility is expected to create new financing opportunities in the fall, but fewer jumbo deals of Charter’s or Avago’s scale are expected. “It’s not a market that is dominated by big deals right now,” the banker said. “But there are going to be quite a few more things on the calendar.”   (Editing by Tessa Walsh and Jon Methven)",9032015,http://www.reuters.com/article/strong-uscredits/trlpc-stronger-us-credits-to-benefit-from-flight-to-quality-idUSL1N1191WO20150903

269,CHTR,Dish Networks petitions FCC to deny Time Warner-Charter merger,"(Reuters) - Dish Network Corp said on Tuesday it filed a petition asking the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deny the proposed merger of Charter Communications Inc and Time Warner Cable, citing substantial harm to competitors and consumers. The petition said that the proposed deal would be no better for the public interest than the one proposed between Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. Dish said that a Time Warner-Charter merger would result in two broadband providers, the other being Comcast, controlling about 90 percent of U.S. high-speed broadband networks. Dish also quoted Sling TV Chief Executive Roger Lynch, who said the proposed merger would harm other emerging competitive online video products and services, and also affect the performance of traditional satellite television service, ultimately reducing competition and choice for consumers. “There is no more friendly broadband provider to Sling than Charter. Charter’s slowest speed is 60 Mbps, we have no data caps, no contracts and modem fees,” Charter spokesman Justin Venech said. Time Warner declined to comment.

272,CHTR,"Time Warner Cable, Charter expect deal closing in first quarter 2016, not 2015","(Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) said its acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N, which is awaiting clearance from U.S. regulators, is now expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, and not by the end of 2015 as planned. The $56 billion deal, announced in May, is subject to intense regulatory scrutiny as the combined company would control a big swath of the U.S. cable and Internet market. “Realistically, we think we’re looking at a first-quarter close,” Charter Chief Executive Tom Rutledge said on a call on Thursday to discuss the company’s third-quarter results. The deal has been approved by the shareholders of both companies and most U.S. states, but is awaiting clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). “From an operational perspective, we are working to be in a position to close as early as this year, but admittedly at this point that feels ambitious,” a Time Warner Cable executive said on a post-earnings call, declining to provide details. National Association of Broadcasters and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) have separately petitioned the FCC to reject the proposed merger, which Dish said would be no better for public interest than Comcast’s proposed deal. Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) dropped a $45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable in April after regulators raised concerns that the deal would give the market leader an unfair advantage. The delay in closing the deal came as no surprise to analysts at MoffettNathanson and Evercore ISI. Charter also has a better chance of closing the deal than Comcast did, they said. “The magnitude and depth of opponents to this transaction was substantially lower than on the Comcast-Time Warner Cable transaction,” Evercore’s Vijay Jayant said. He said the deal could close by March if everything went to plan. Shares of Time Warner Cable and Charter were up 2.5 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively, in midday trading on Thursday after both companies posted strong third-quarter results. Time Warner Cable posted a better-than-expected adjusted profit as, on a net basis, it added more high-speed data customers than expected and lost fewer net video subscribers than feared. While the company is benefiting from rising demand for high-speed internet services, it stemmed video subscriber losses by offering “triple play bundling” services, combining pay-TV, high speed data and voice.

274,CHTR,Fitch Rates Charter's New Sr. Notes 'BB' on Positive Watch,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB' rating on  Positive Watch to CCOH Safari, LLC's (CCOH Safari) multi-tranche issuance of  benchmark sized senior unsecured notes. CCO Holdings, LLC (CCOH) will assume the  notes upon the completion of Charter Communications, Inc.'s (Charter) merger  with Time Warner Cable, Inc. (TWC) and acquisition of Bright House Networks  (Bright House).  CCOH and Charter Communications Operating, LLC (CCO) are indirect wholly owned  subsidiaries of Charter. Fitch placed CCOH and CCO's 'BB-' IDRs on Rating Watch  Positive following the April 2015 announcement of the acquisition of Bright  House from Advance/Newhouse Partnership (A/N) for $10.4 billion. Following the  announcement that Comcast Corporation and TWC had terminated their merger  agreement, on May 18, 2015 Charter and A/N reaffirmed their commitment to  complete the Bright House acquisition under the same economic and governance  terms.  If the Bright House acquisition does not occur, Fitch will remove CCOH and CCO  from Rating Watch Positive. If the TWC merger does not occur, the CCOH Safari  notes are required to be repaid, and Fitch will withdraw the rating.  At this time, Fitch maintains CCOH and CCO's current 'BB-' IDRs and related debt  securities on Rating Watch Positive. CCOH Safari was created to allow Charter to opportunistically pre-fund the  transactions, with the proceeds placed into escrow in CCOH Safari until the  transactions are completed. Prior to the consummation of the transactions, the  notes will be secured by a first-priority interest in the cash held in CCOH  Safari's escrow account. The cash will be released once the transactions are  complete and all related conditions are met, at which time CCOH Safari will  merge into CCOH which will become the obligor of the notes. If the transactions  are not completed, the notes will be subject to a mandatory redemption at par.  Once the notes become the obligations of CCOH, they will rank pari passu in  right of payment with all existing and future senior notes and all existing and  future unsubordinated, unsecured debt of CCOH.  On May 23, 2015, Charter announced a merger with TWC for total consideration of  $196.60 per share, providing a total valuation for TWC of $78.7 billion as of  the announcement date. The offer consists of a combination of cash and Charter  stock totaling $56.4 billion for all outstanding TWC shares. As part of the  transaction, approximately $23.3 billion of existing TWC debt will be rolled  into CCO and will have equal and ratable security with all first lien debt  (existing Charter and TWC debt and newly issued debt). The TWC merger is not  contingent on the acquisition of Bright House. TWC's total consideration assumes that all TWC shareholders elect to receive  $100.00 cash and 0.5409 shares of Charter common stock for each share of TWC  common stock. However, TWC's shareholders have the option to receive $115.00  cash and 0.4562 shares of Charter common stock for each share of TWC common  stock. If the latter occurs, Charter has committed financing for approximately  $4.3 billion of additional unsecured debt to be issued by CCOH. Fitch views both transactions positively and believes they will strengthen  Charter's overall credit profile. Fitch anticipates that Charter's total  leverage, pro forma for both the TWC merger as it is currently structured and  the Bright House acquisition, would be under 5.0x at closing. Integration risks  are elevated, and Charter's ability to manage the integration process and limit  disruption to the company's overall operations is key to the success of the  transactions. On a pro forma basis the combined company will serve 24 million customer  relationships and become the second largest cable multiple system operator in  the country. Pro forma revenues totalled approximately $36 billion during 2014  and EBITDA was approximately $13 billion. Charter's operating strategies are  having a positive impact on the company's operating profile resulting in a  strengthened competitive position. The market share-driven strategy, which is  focused on enhancing the overall competitiveness of Charter's video service and  leveraging its all-digital infrastructure, is improving subscriber metrics,  growing revenue and ARPU trends, and stabilizing operating margins. Resolution of the Rating Watch will largely be based on Fitch's review of  Charter's ultimate capital structure including assignment of potential equity  credit to the convertible preferred partnership units and an assessment of the  risks associated with Charter's ability to integrate the new cable systems from  TWC and Bright House. KEY RATING DRIVERS All three entities regularly produce strong levels of free cash flow (FCF) that  provide the company with substantial financial flexibility. Charter management  stated that, in the short term, they will use FCF to meet existing and planned  amortization, which along with EBITDA improvement is expected to lower leverage  by 0.6x annually. They also stated that there are no short-term plans for  shareholder friendly activities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating actions would be contemplated if the TWC merger and the Bright  House acquisition go forward as total leverage is expected to be below 5.0x; --If the company demonstrates progress in closing gaps relative to its industry  peers on service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives; --Operating profile strengthens as the company captures sustainable revenue and  cash flow growth envisioned when implementing the current operating strategy; --Fitch believes negative rating actions would likely coincide with a leveraging  transaction or the adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that  increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan; --Adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy; --A perceived weakening of Charter's competitive position or failure of the  current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth  along with strengthening operating margins. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as  satisfactory given the rating category. Charter's financial flexibility will  improve in step with the growth of free cash flow generation. Charter generated  $543 million of free cash flow (FCF) during the LTM period ended Sept.  30,  2015. FCF has been increasing due primarily to a decrease in capital  expenditures driven by the completion of Charter's transition to all digital in  2014. The company's liquidity position is primarily supported by available  borrowing capacity from its $1.3 revolver and anticipated free cash flow  generation. Commitments under the company's revolver will expire in April 2018.  As of Sept. 30, 2015, approximately $1.0 billion was available for borrowing. Charter's leverage as of the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2015 was 4.2x (excluding the  debt issued by CCOH Safari, LLC and CCO Safari, LLC which was repaid following  the termination of the Comcast TWC merger.) Charter's total leverage target  remains unchanged ranging between 4x and 4.5x. Fitch recognizes that a large  portion of the TWC transaction will involve senior secured debt, both existing  at TWC and new issuance. Charter recently stated that it expects to maintain a  senior leverage target of 3.5x following the completion of the TWC and Bright  House transactions. Depending on the ultimate capital structure, a one or two  notch upgrade of Charter's IDR and existing ratings could be possible provided  that pro forma senior secured leverage is at or below 4.0x and total leverage  does not exceed 5.0x.  FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch has assigned the following rating: CCOH Safari, LLC --Senior unsecured notes 'BB' on Rating Watch Positive.  Fitch maintains the following ratings for CCO Holdings, LLC on Rating Watch  Positive: --Long-term IDR 'BB-'; --Senior unsecured 'BB-'.

Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: CCO Safari II, LLC --Senior secured at 'BBB-'. CCO Safari III, LLC --Senior secured at 'BBB-'.

279,CHTR,U.S. FCC delays Charter-Time Warner Cable merger review by two weeks,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said it is delaying its informal deadline by 15 days to review the proposed $56 billion merger of cable rivals Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N. This delay in the 180-day countdown will give the regulators sufficient time to review the new information filed by the companies, throughout December, regarding Charter’s residential pricing and packaging methodology and its plan to deploy a new low-cost broadband service, the commission said in a letter to companies.  The 15-day pause, which is now set to conclude on Jan. 20, will also allow the regulator to look at proposed transaction’s impact on the distribution of Time Warner Cable’s regional sports networks, the commission added in the letter, posted on its website, on Monday. FCC’s so-called 180-day “shot clock”, which was started in September, is used as guidance, though it is often surpassed.

280,CHTR,U.S. FCC delays Charter-Time Warner Cable merger review by two weeks,"Jan 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said it is delaying its informal deadline by 15 days to review the proposed $56 billion merger of cable rivals Charter Communications Inc and Time Warner Cable Inc. This delay in the 180-day countdown will give the regulators sufficient time to review the new information filed by the companies, throughout December, regarding Charter's residential pricing and packaging methodology and its plan to deploy a new low-cost broadband service, the commission said in a letter to companies. (bit.ly/1VDUNtd) The 15-day pause, which is now set to conclude on Jan. 20, will also allow the regulator to look at proposed transaction’s impact on the distribution of Time Warner Cable’s regional sports networks, the commission added in the letter, posted on its website, on Monday. FCC’s so-called 180-day “shot clock”, which was started in September, is used as guidance, though it is often surpassed.

281,CHTR,"Time Warner Cable's revenue, profit beat estimates","(Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc, which is being bought by Charter Communications Inc, reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for the fourth quarter as it added more residential video customers. Time Warner Cable said it added 54,000 residential video customers in the quarter, in line with estimates at FactSet StreetAccount. High-speed data subscribers’ additions rose 21 percent to 281,000 from the third quarter. The numbers are in contrast to the trends in the preceding quarter, when cable companies grappled with declining subscriber numbers as viewers shifted to cheaper and more flexible streaming services offered by Netflix Inc and others. Time Warner Cable said revenue rose 4.9 percent to $6.07 billion in the fourth quarter, from $5.79 billion a year earlier. Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $486 million, or $1.70 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $554 million, or $1.95 per share. On an adjusted basis, Time Warner earned $1.80 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.78 on revenue of $6.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

290,CHTR,UPDATE 2-U.S. FCC says it receives 104 bids to participate in spectrum auction,"(Adds details on T-Mobile, Puerto Rico Telephone company;  Liberty and Comcast could not be reached for comment) By David Shepardson and Malathi Nayak WASHINGTON/NEW YORK March 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Friday that it had received 104 applications to take part in an auction of valuable low-frequency airwaves relinquished by TV broadcasters,     including many wireless companies who want to use the airwaves to build new networks or improve existing coverage. The government plays the middleman in the auction designed so broadcasters are incentivized to sell at the lowest rates and telecom companies are encouraged to buy at the highest rates. The government keeps a large part of the difference. The FCC said 69 applications are complete and 35 are incomplete. The incomplete applicants have until April 6 to finish their application. The applicants include subsidiaries of Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T;, T-Mobile US Inc  and Liberty Global Plc  and many U.S. rural carriers. Some applications were filed by individuals, partnerships, consortiums or other corporate entities and ownership of the entities will not be publicly known until Monday. Also applying to bid is Puerto Rico Telephone Company Inc, a firm owned by Mexican telecom giant America Movil SAB, which is controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim. In an FCC filing from February seen by Reuters, Liberty’s subsidiary “Liberty Spectrum Inc” told the agency that it may bid on one or more blocks of low-frequency spectrum in the auction to potentially provide mobile wireless services in Puerto Rico. Liberty Global, headquartered in London and backed by cable pioneer John Malone, could not be immediately reached for comment. Malone’s Liberty Broadband Corp. backs U.S.-based pay-TV provider Charter Communications Inc, which appeared on Friday to be absent from the FCC’s list although more details could emerge on Monday once the agency releases the auction applications. Charter’s chief executive has said in recent weeks participation in the auction was unlikely. Comcast Corp and Dish Network Corp both said previously they planned to bid. A person familiar with the bids said that cable company Comcast had bid through a company with a different name. Comcast did not respond to a request for comment. Silicon Valley investment firm Social Capital has said it will take part and filed an application, while the No.4 U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp and Alphabet Inc, which participated but did not buy in a 2008 auction, have said they are sitting out. Analysts forecast that the upcoming auction could fetch proceeds in the $15 billion to $45 billion range, but they expect bidders to be less aggressive than in the FCC’s last auction, the “AWS-3 auction,” which ended last year and set a record of $44.9 billion in bids. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said earlier this month that he was “encouraged by the strong interest that we have seen both from broadcasters interested in selling their spectrum and the broad assortment of parties interested in buying it.” Separately, the FCC said Friday that a decision by a federal appeals court late Thursday to allow Latina Broadcasters to provisionally participate in the auction that begins March 29 will not delay the auction. The FCC in February denied Latina Broadcasters application to participate.

295,CHTR,Fitch Maintains Charter Communication's 'BB-' IDR on Watch Positive,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has maintained the 'BB-' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDR) assigned to CCO Holdings, LLC (CCOH) and Charter Communications  Operating, LLC (CCO) on Rating Watch Positive. Fitch has also affirmed the  specific issue ratings assigned to CCO Safari II, LLC (CCO Safari II) and CCO  Safari III, LLC (CCO Safari III). A complete list of rating actions follows at  the end of this release. Approximately $35.9 billion of debt (principal value)  outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2015 is affected by Fitch's action. CCOH and CCO are  indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter). This release and maintenance of the Rating Watch are in accordance with Fitch's  guidelines related to the review of Rating Watch status following Fitch's  placement of the companies' ratings on Rating Watch Positive on April 2, 2015.  Fitch placed CCOH and CCO's 'BB-' IDRs on Rating Watch Positive following the  announcement of the acquisition of Bright House Networks (Bright House) from  Advance/Newhouse Partnership (A/N). The Bright House acquisition is valued at  $11.1 billion as of Feb. 4, 2016. Resolution of the Rating Watch will be based largely on Fitch's review of  Charter's capital structure if the transactions are completed. Further inputs  will include the assignment of potential equity credit to the convertible  preferred partnership units and a further assessment of the risks associated  with Charter's ability to integrate cable systems acquired from TWC and Bright  House. Depending on the ultimate capital structure, a one- or two-notch upgrade  could be possible. On May 23, 2015, Charter announced a merger with Time Warner Cable, Inc. (TWC)  for total consideration of $203.28 per share as of Feb. 4, 2016, providing a  total valuation for TWC of $80.1 billion. The offer consists of a combination of  cash and Charter stock totaling $58.4 billion for all outstanding TWC shares.  TWC shareholders have two options for the split between cash and Charter common  stock: 1) $100.00 cash and 0.5409 shares of Charter common stock for each share  of TWC common stock or 2) $115.00 cash and 0.4562 shares of Charter common stock  for each share of TWC common stock. If shareholders choose the latter option,  Charter has the financial flexibility, which may include a portion of the net  proceeds from its February 2016 issuance of $1.7 billion of senior notes due  2024, to fund the increased cash needs. If Charter requires additional liquidity  to satisfy cash funding needs for TWC shareholders, CCOH has committed financing  in place for $5 billion of unsecured debt. KEY RATING DRIVERS M&A; Activity Credit-Positive: Fitch views the TWC and Bright House transactions  positively and believes they will strengthen Charter's overall credit profile.  Fitch anticipates that Charter's total leverage, pro forma for both the TWC  merger as it is currently structured and the Bright House acquisition, would be  under 5x at closing. The Federal Communications Commission and the U.S.  Department of Justice are expected to issue conditionally positive rulings  within the next few weeks, while Charter has received approval from each state  it will operate in, except California, which is expected to issue a ruling in  May 2016. Integration Key to Success: Integration risks are elevated with two simultaneous  transactions, and Charter's ability to manage the integration process and limit  disruption to the company's overall operations is key to the success of the  transactions. Credit Profile Changes: Charter's pro forma Fitch-calculated total leverage will  exceed its target of 4x and 4.5x at closing, but is expected to fall below 4.5x  within 12 months. In addition, the company stated it expects its first lien  leverage to be below 3.5x following the completion of the TWC and Bright House  transactions. On a pro forma operating basis, the combined company will serve 24  million customers and become the second largest cable multiple system operator  in the country  Improving Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are having a  positive impact on the company's operating profile, resulting in a strengthened  competitive position. The market-share-driven strategy, focused on enhancing  Charter's video service competitiveness and leveraging its all-digital  infrastructure, is improving subscriber metrics, growing revenue and average  revenue per unit (ARPU) trends, and stabilizing operating margins. Digital Initiatives Enable FCF Growth: Charter has completed its all-digital-service transition, which, along with the introduction of its  interactive IP-based video user interface, positions the company to offer a more  competitive service. Fitch anticipates these initiatives will alleviate  residential video subscriber losses and increase service penetration while  boosting ARPUs, and translate into accelerating revenue growth, margin expansion  and growing free cash flow (FCF) generation. Strong FCF Provides Financial Flexibility: All three entities (Charter, TWC and  Bright House) produce strong FCF that provide the companies, separately and in  aggregate, substantial financial flexibility. Once the transactions are  completed, Charter stated it will use FCF in the short term to meet existing and  planned amortization, which along with EBITDA improvement is expected to lower  leverage by 0.6x annually. They also stated there are no short-term plans for  shareholder-friendly activities. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Due to the uncertainty surrounding approval of the TWC and Bright House  transactions, Fitch's forecast reflects Charter on a standalone basis. Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Charter include: --Low-to-mid-single-digit cable revenue growth highlighted by continued  high-speed data and commercial service revenue growth. --EBITDA margins remain flat reflecting ARPU growth from subscribers taking more  advanced video services and higher speed data service tiers, offset by increased  programming costs and spending to enhance customer service and products. --Fitch estimates Charter will generate $400 million of FCF in 2016, slightly  less than the anticipated $1 billion to $1.2 billion of FCF during 2017 and  2018, respectively. FCF in 2016 is negatively impacted by additional interest  expense related to debt issued by CCOH Safari, LLC, CCO Safari II, and CCO  Safari III (collectively, Safari Entities). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating actions would be contemplated given the following: --The TWC merger and the Bright House acquisition go forward as expected and  total leverage is below 5.0x; --If the company demonstrates progress in closing gaps relative to its industry  peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives; --Operating profile strengthens as the company captures sustainable revenue and  cash flow growth envisioned when implementing the current operating strategy. Fitch believes negative rating actions would likely occur given the following: --A leveraging transaction or the adoption of a more aggressive financial  strategy that increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the absence of a credible  deleveraging plan; --Adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy; --A perceived weakening of Charter's competitive position or failure of the  current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth  along with strengthening operating margins. LIQUIDITY Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as  satisfactory given the rating category. Charter's financial flexibility will  improve in step with the growth of FCF generation. Charter generated $519  million of FCF during the year ended Dec. 31, 2015. Although FCF had been  increasing due primarily to a decrease in capital expenditures driven by the  completion of Charter's transition to all-digital in 2014, 2015 was negatively  impacted by interest expense associated with debt issued for the transactions.  The company's liquidity position includes cash of $5 million, excluding cash  held in escrow at Safari Entities, and is supported by $961 million of borrowing  capacity from its $1.3 billion revolver and anticipated FCF generation.  Commitments under the company's revolver will expire in April 2018. Fitch notes  that the revolver will increase to $3 billion as part of the TWC and Bright  House transactions. Charter's leverage as of the last 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2015 was 4.1x,  excluding the debt issued by Safari Entities. Charter's total leverage target  remains unchanged, ranging between 4x and 4.5x, and will remain unchanged  following the completion of the transactions. Fitch recognizes that a large  portion of the TWC transaction will involve senior secured debt, both at TWC and  the Safari Entities, including approximately $22.5 billion of existing TWC  senior secured debt. All existing TWC and Safari Entities first-lien debt will  be rolled into CCO and will have equal and ratable security with all existing  Charter first-lien debt.  Charter stated it expects its first lien leverage of 3.5x upon the closing of  the transactions. Depending on the ultimate capital structure, a one- or  two-notch upgrade of Charter's IDR and existing ratings could be possible  provided that pro forma senior secured leverage is at or below 4x and total  leverage does not exceed 5x. Charter proactively extended its maturity profile and only 5% of outstanding  debt matures before 2019, including $93 million and $102 million during 2016 and  2017, respectively. Fitch believes that Charter has the financial flexibility to  retire near-term maturities with cash on hand and future FCF.

302,CHTR,UPDATE 3-U.S. approves Charter's Time Warner Cable buy with conditions,"(Adds further conditions being sought by FCC) By Diane Bartz, Malathi Nayak and David Shepardson WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday gave antitrust approval to Charter Communications Inc’s proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc  and Bright House networks, which would create the second-largest U.S. broadband provider and third-largest video provider. The Justice Department’s approval carried conditions designed to protect competition, coming at a time when the pay television industry faces stagnation due to new competition from over-the-web rivals like Netflix and Hulu. The Federal Communications Commission must also approve the deal, and the agency’s chairman on Monday said he, too, was prepared to put conditions on the merger aimed at promoting broadband competition. The Justice Department said that as part of its approval, Charter agreed to refrain from telling its content providers that they cannot also sell shows online. “Continued growth of OVDs (online video) promises to deliver more competitive choices and a greater ability for consumers to customize their consumption of video content to their individual viewing preferences and budgets,” the Justice Department said in a court filing. “The emergence of OVDs threatens to upend the competitive landscape.” At the FCC, Chairman Tom Wheeler said he circulated an order seeking approval of the merger with conditions that “will directly benefit consumers by bringing and protecting competition to the video marketplace and increasing broadband deployment.” Wheeler said if approved the conditions would require Charter to extend high speed internet access to another two million customers within five years - with one million served by a broadband competitor. Additionally, Charter would not be permitted to charge usage-based prices or impose data caps and would be prohibited from charging interconnection fees, including to online video providers, which deliver large volumes of internet traffic to broadband customers. He said the agreement would “demonstrate the viability of one broadband provider overbuilding another.” It was not immediately clear when the FCC would decide. Both sets of conditions would be in place for seven years;  Charter had sought three. Charter has valued the deal at $56.7 billion for Time Warner Cable, excluding debt, and $10.4 billion for Bright House Networks. Charter said it was pleased with both the Justice Department and FCC’s actions. “We are confident New Charter will be a leading competitor in the broadband and video markets,” the company said in a statement. Shareholders of both companies have approved the deal. The only other outstanding approval needed is from one last state, California. An administrative judge has recommended the state’s public utilities commission approve the deal, which could come as early as May 12 Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp, had pursued TWC as far back as 2013. The two companies had acrimonious exchanges in 2013 and early 2014 that ended with Time Warner Cable rejecting unsolicited approaches by Charter and instead finding a white knight in Comcast Corp , the No. 1 U.S. cable services provider. Comcast’s $45 billion bid, however, fell through a year ago, after U.S. regulators raised concerns. Following that, Charter and TWC resumed deal talks. In May last year, Charter said it would buy TWC in a cash-and-stock deal in order to compete with Comcast. Charter gained about 5 percent to close at $207.01 On Monday and Time Warner rose 4.1 percent to close at $209.63.

328,CHTR,"Speculation builds on a Verizon-Charter tie-up, no offer made","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc	is interested in exploring a combination with U.S. cable company Charter Communication Inc as part of a long list of acquisition targets, but no proposal has been made for a tie-up between the two companies, sources told Reuters on Thursday.    Speculation over a combination of the companies underscores the pressure the nation’s largest wireless carrier faces to do a deal in the wake of AT&T; Inc’s planned $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner Inc. Verizon and other carriers also face a saturated smartphone market. Verizon said in July that it struck a deal to buy Yahoo Inc’s core internet properties, but the deal was cast into doubt after Yahoo disclosed data breaches last year.  “I think the market is predictably impatient and wants Verizon to do something yesterday,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “The market inevitably draws the comparison to AT&T; that, for better or worse, has made its big strategic bet.”  After rising as much as 10 percent and hitting a session high of $341.50 on the news, Charter shares eased and were trading up 6.5 percent at $330.59. Verizon shares were down 1.4 percent at $49.08. Charter and Verizon declined to comment.     A Charter acquisition would signal that Verizon has a drastically different strategic vision than rival AT&T;, which has sought to diversify away from the wireless business through its deal for Time Warner and earlier acquisition of satellite-TV provider DirecTV. Instead, a deal for Charter would indicate Verizon is betting on infrastructure. On its earnings conference call with investors on Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said that 5G wireless technology was a focus for Verizon. “The great irony could be that the cable operators are better positioned to compete in 5G wireless than the wireless operators themselves,” Moffett said. Speculation over a tie-up with Charter has been building steadily since last month when Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam told Wall Street analysts that such a deal would make “industrial sense,” according to a December note by BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk.   With Charter, Verizon would gain a fiber and cable network across 49 million homes, including markets in California, Texas, and Florida, that the wireless carrier recently divested to Frontier Communications Corp, JPMorgan analysts said in a note in December.  From a traditional antitrust point of view, the combination of a phone company and a cable company would not raise competition issues that cannot be overcome, said George Bittlingmayer, a professor at the University of Kansas School of Business.  “The wildcard here is whether people’s unhappiness with their cable and mobile phone providers would translate into some grandstanding and arm-twisting on the part of the new administration for political benefit,” he said.     Phil Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in an email on Thursday that he expects $2 billion in annual synergies from a Charter deal but added that the deal’s math is “difficult to make work,” noting that a combined company would be heavily leveraged.  The Wall Street Journal, which first reported a preliminary approach between the companies, said it was unclear if Charter’s executives would be open to a transaction and that there was no guarantee a deal would be struck.

335,CHTR,"UPDATE 1-New York sues Charter, alleges Time Warner fraud on internet speeds","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York filed a lawsuit on Wednesday accusing Charter Communications Inc of short-changing customers who were promised faster internet speeds than it could deliver. The lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan accused Charter’s Spectrum unit, until recently known as Time Warner Cable, of systematically defrauding customers since 2012 by promising and charging for services it knew it could not offer. At least 640,000 subscribers signed up for high-speed plans but got slower speeds, and many subscribers were unable to access promised online content such as Facebook, Netflix, YouTube and various gaming platforms, the complaint said. The lawsuit seeks “full restitution” for customers, as well as hefty civil fines. In a press conference, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office filed the lawsuit after fielding thousands of complaints from unhappy customers. “The allegations in today’s lawsuits confirm what many of you have long suspected,” he said. “Spectrum-Time Warner has been ripping you off.” Charter bought Time Warner Cable last year. In a statement, Charter said it was disappointed that the attorney general challenged Time Warner Cable’s broadband speed advertisements that predated the merger. “We will continue to invest in our business and deliver the highest quality services to our customers while we defend against these allegations involving Time Warner Cable practices,” the Stamford, Connecticut-based company said. Among the allegations in the complaint was an accusation that Time Warner Cable leased older-generation modems to 900,000 subscribers knowing that the modems could not achieve faster internet speeds. Schneiderman had in October launched a probe into whether three major internet providers were shortchanging consumers. The others included Verizon Communications Inc and Cablevision Systems Corp, now owned by European telecom group Altice NV.

342,CHTR,UPDATE 2-Trump touts Charter hiring that was in works for two years,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday touted Charter Communications Inc’s decision to invest $25 billion in the United States and a plan the company announced before he was elected to hire 20,000 workers over four years. At a White House event with the second-largest U.S. cable company’s Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Trump praised Charter for planning to close its offshore call centers and move them to the United States. Much of the announcement was not new. Charter said last May that it planned to add 20,000 jobs as part of its merger with Time Warner Cable and acquisition of Bright House Networks. As early as June 2015, Rutledge said Charter would need an additional 20,000 employees after those deals. On a number of occasions, Trump has touted job announcements at the White House that had been previously planned or announced  The company said more than a year ago in February 2016 that it planned to close foreign Time Warner Cable call centers and move the jobs to the United States. On Friday, Trump said, “We’re embracing a new economic model - the American Model. We’re going to massively eliminate job-killing regulations - that has started already, big league - reduce government burdens, and lower taxes that are crushing American businesses and American workers. “You’re going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs, of companies, and everything coming back into our country.” Charter, which has 24 million residential and business customers in 41 states, said on Friday it had committed to Trump to hiring those workers within four years. It plans to invest $25 billion in broadband infrastructure and technology in the next four years. In May 2016 Rutledge said in a recorded interview there would be some overlap in management positions (after the TWC merger) but said the company would hire about 20,000 people over four years.     Rutledge said the broadband investment was being made “in the right regulatory climate and right tax climate ... We’re committed to spending that predicated on the kind of regulatory consistency and efficiency that we expect as a country.” Charter agreed in May 2016 to make significant broadband  investment under a deal with the Federal Communications Commission that was part of winning approval to acquire the cable networks. At that time Charter agreed to extend high-speed internet access to another two million customers within five years, with one million served by a broadband competitor. Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement on Friday that the commission was “working to set rules of the road that encourage companies to build and upgrade broadband networks across the country.” He credited the FCC’s “investment-friendly policies” in part for Charter’s commitments. The agency is considering a petition by the American Cable Association to strike the requirement Charter extend service to areas already served by companies because it could harm smaller competitors. Charter also touted its plans to open a new bilingual call center in McAllen, Texas and said it expects to employ 600 there by the end of 2018. Plans to open a call center in Texas were announced last October.   In December, Trump announced that telecommunications group Sprint Corp and U.S. satellite company OneWeb would bring 8,000 jobs to the United States, and the companies said the positions were part of a previously disclosed pledge by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. In January, Sprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said of its decision to shift 5,000 call center jobs to the United States that the company “had plans to do this for a while.”  ",3242017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-charter-commns/update-2-trump-touts-charter-hiring-that-was-in-works-for-two-years-idUSL2N1H1106
343,CHTR,HIGHLIGHTS-The Trump presidency on March 24 at 5:31 p.m. EDT/2131 GMT,"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday: Trump suffers a stunning political setback in a Congress controlled by his own party when Republican leaders pull legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies. Trump says the healthcare legislation he supported had been “very, very close” to getting enough support in the House of Representatives and that now he probably will move on to tax reform. Wall Street’s predilection for a glass-half-full view of Trump is on full display as investors back off fears that a failure to repeal Obamacare would endanger his entire agenda in favor of optimism that he will simply get on with tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Nearly half of American adults say the Republican healthcare reform measure that was pulled from consideration by the House is “not an improvement” over Obamacare, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The partisan divide over the House Intelligence Committee’s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election deepens when the committee’s top Democrat suggested its Republican chairman canceled a public hearing after pressure from the White House. A third of Democratic senators have so far announced they will vote against confirming Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, adding to a chorus of opposition from the left, but leaving questions over whether there will be a concerted effort to block a vote in the Senate. Trump’s administration approves TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL pipeline, cheering the oil industry and angering environmentalists even as further hurdles for the controversial project loom. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says financial markets could improve “significantly” once they fully reflect the potential for economic growth from Trump’s policies. A federal judge in Virginia rules that Trump’s travel ban was justified, increasing the likelihood the measure will go before the Supreme Court as the decision takes an opposing view to courts in Maryland and Hawaii that have halted the order.  California approves vehicle pollution targets that the Trump administration last week put on hold, setting up a potential face-off between federal and state regulators that could be expensive for automakers and a headache for consumers.

345,CHTR,UPDATE 4-U.S. FCC limits order on Charter extending broadband service,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is reversing a requirement imposed under the Obama administration that Charter Communications Inc extend broadband service to 1 million households already served by a competitor, under an order to be made public on Monday. The decision was a win for a group representing smaller cable companies that sought to overturn the “overbuild” requirement and marked the latest reversal of Obama-era requirements by the new Republican-led FCC under President Donald Trump. As a condition of approval for its acquisition of two cable companies, Charter had agreed in May 2016 to extend high-speed internet access to 2 million customers within five years, with 1 million served by a broadband competitor. Under the new order approved on Friday and disclosed Monday, Charter, the No. 2 U.S. cable company with 26 million residential and business customers in 41 states, must add service to 2 million additional potential subscribers in places without existing service, the FCC said. “This is like telling two people you will buy them lunch, ordering two entrees, and then sending both to just one of your companions,” FCC chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. “It runs directly against the goal of promoting greater Internet access for all Americans.”     The American Cable Association petitioned the FCC to reverse the requirement in 2016 and has met with FCC commissioners in recent weeks. The group had called the requirement under then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler “stunningly bad and inexplicable government policy.” The group warned it would have “devastating effects on the smaller broadband providers Charter will overbuild” because they would face competition from an “uneconomic, government mandated entry” that could put some companies out of business. Gigi Sohn, a former top Wheeler aide, said the decision shows the Republican FCC is more focused on putting “incumbents first” than on competition. She cited its putting broadband privacy rules on hold and withholding federal approval of new companies to offer government subsidized telecommunication services. The requirement, as part of Charter’s acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, would bring “innovation and new choices for consumers, and demonstrate the viability of one broadband provider overbuilding another,” Wheeler said last year. On Monday Wheeler tweeted, “Nobody likes competition ... except consumers!”  Charter said the change “enables Charter to more fully devote our resources and attention to building out high-speed broadband to areas without it today.” Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge met with Trump at the White House last month to tout the company’s investment and hiring plans. Charter stock closed up 0.3 percent to $328.27 in afternoon trading.

The decision was a win for a group representing smaller cable companies that petitioned to overturn the “overbuild” requirement. As a condition of approval for its acquisition of two cable companies, Charter in May 2016 agreed to extend high-speed internet access to two million customers within five years, with one million served by a broadband competitor.

347,CHTR,Comcast goes into U.S. wireless business with unlimited data plans,"NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp said on Thursday it is launching a new wireless service with an unlimited data plan, making it the first major U.S. cable provider to enter into the highly competitive wireless market, as it faces pressure in its core business. Unlimited data, talk and text will be available by mid-year for $65 per line for up to five lines, or $45 per line for customers with Comcast’s top X1 packages, which bundle together TV, internet and phone services. Alternatively, customers can opt to pay $12 per gigabyte each month. In recent months, the four major U.S. wireless carriers - Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp - have offered unlimited data plans ranging from $50 a month for a single line to $90 a month. The move into the wireless business by the U.S. No. 1 cable provider shows how cable companies are looking to add more services to their offerings with the hope of reducing customer churn, or attrition, as younger viewers back away from high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper options, such as “cutting the cord” entirely and watching online. Rival cable provider Charter Communications Inc is also planning to launch a wireless service in 2018. Details released on Thursday offer a glimpse of how Comcast plans to make inroads in an oversaturated market for U.S. wireless service that is increasingly price-driven. “We believe we have very competitive unlimited plans,” said Greg Butz, president of Comcast’s mobile business, adding that the company was able to pass savings it generated by packaging the service with high-speed data and video on to consumers. The company does not plan to offer phone subsidies. The service, dubbed Xfinity Mobile, will launch on Verizon’s airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the two companies. It will employ Comcast’s 16 million Wi-Fi hotspots within its footprint, allowing customers to automatically switch onto Wi-Fi from 4G LTE. Comcast will limit the service’s rollout to customers within its footprint, which includes major markets like Philadelphia and Chicago. It will initially be available only to subscribers who have Xfinity broadband service. Comcast had roughly 25 million high-speed Internet customers in 2016, according to a filing. Comcast did not say how much it has invested in Xfinity Mobile or what kind of return it expects. Analysts at JPMorgan said in a note in January that building a wireless business could cost Comcast hundreds of millions of dollars a year in the first few years, potentially cutting as much as 5 cents to 10 cents off earnings per share in 2017. The wireless service will be available on Apple Inc’s iPhones as well as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Galaxy phones.

359,CHTR,RPT-T-Mobile’s expanded network has rivals - and suitors - taking notice,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Anjali Athavaley NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc has built a reputation as a scrappy underdog by offering cell service with no contracts and cheap prices. Now it’s aiming for another title: America’s No. 1 wireless carrier. That might seem a stretch for a cell-phone company long known for its lousy coverage outside of major cities. But over the past five years T-Mobile has been on a buying binge to extend its reach. Bankrolled by a $3 billion break-up fee from a failed 2011 merger with AT&T; Inc, it has snapped up wireless airwaves in states ranging from New York to Washington. Suddenly, T-Mobile, the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier, is within striking distance of market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T;, at least when it comes to delivering nationwide coverage. OpenSignal, a London-based startup that measures network experience based on data from users of its app, said in February that T-Mobile and Verizon were tied in speed rankings in the last quarter of 2016. Testers found a Verizon signal 88 percent of the time; T-Mobile’s network availability was just two percentage points lower. T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray says the bulk of the country will soon have access to its network. “There’s nothing that stands between us delivering and matching, if not beating, Verizon and AT&T;’s coverage,” Ray said in an interview with Reuters in May. Verizon and AT&T; still maintain a hefty lead when it comes to retail subscribers, each boasting around double T-Mobile’s 55 million users. They also have higher profit margins. Still, T-Mobile’s client base has been growing steadily. Its share of retail subscribers grew to 18 percent in the first quarter of 2017, up from 10 percent in the same period in 2012, according to data from financial services firm Barclays. And when it comes to users who pay a monthly bill, the industry's most valuable customers, T-Mobile has grown that segment for four straight years, while Verizon and AT&T; lost monthly subscribers in the first quarter of 2017. For a graphic on T-Mobile's market share in wireless, see tmsnrt.rs/2rB2pYi T-Mobile’s German majority owner Deutsche Telekom AG , which owns roughly 65 percent of the U.S. carrier, says T-Mobile is now positioned to call its own shots as it plots its course in the United States. “We decide what, when, and how,” Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges said at an annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. That includes T-Mobile remaining a stand-alone carrier. But the real intrigue in telecom circles is about a possible merger or acquisition. Rival Sprint Corp , America’s No. 4 carrier, has expressed interest in a tie-up. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, Sprint’s controlling shareholder, was prepared to give up control to do a deal with T-Mobile, sources familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters in February. Cable companies, too, could be interested as they roll out wireless services to bundle more products together. In January, John Malone, whose Liberty Broadband Corp is the largest stakeholder in Charter Communications Inc, raised the possibility that major cable companies could get together and buy T-Mobile. The buzz has boosted T-Mobile’s stock price, which is up nearly 60 percent from a year ago. First-quarter profits hit $698 million, or 80 cents per share, up 46 percent from a year earlier and well ahead of analysts’ expectations. The success of T-Mobile, which has dubbed itself the “Un-carrier,” can be attributed partly to its straight-up approach to mobile. It was the first major carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has continued to badger rivals, most recently with its unlimited data plans. But copious data and fast speeds are pointless if mobile users can’t get a signal. Verizon, the biggest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, says T-Mobile still has a lot of catching up to do. Chief network officer Nicola Palmer pointed to data from testing firm RootMetrics, which has called Verizon the clear U.S. leader in coverage and reliability. Some T-Mobile customers, too, say their service isn’t what it should be. Austin, Texas-resident Abbie Scheider, an avid camper, says she’s out of luck in the woods of central Texas. “I never have service even when others do,” the 24-year-old ad agency account executive said. “It’s frustrating for sure.” T-Mobile’s big push to boost coverage began in 2012 when it received cash plus spectrum from a failed merger with AT&T.; The U.S. Justice Department in 2011 sued to block the deal on concerns it would harm competition. Facing the prospect of a lengthy regulatory battle, AT&T; walked away. T-Mobile subsequently picked up spectrum from a 2013 merger with Texas-based MetroPCS Communications, followed by a 2014 asset swap with Verizon. Its most ambitious effort yet came in April when it committed $8 billion to become the biggest spender in a U.S. government auction of wireless airwaves. The purchase, which T-Mobile executives refer to as the “mother lode,” will strengthen the company’s presence this year across the western United States, including Arizona, Montana, Texas and Wyoming. And T-Mobile isn’t done yet. Like its competitors, the company is pushing into so-called fifth generation wireless or 5G, a new network that is expected to offer higher speeds and lower response times. While it continues to invest in its network, T-Mobile says it is open to considering various strategic options. Company officials have acknowledged interest in talking with Sprint. At an investor conference in May, T-Mobile Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said Sprint’s spectrum was a “treasure trove that you could do amazing things with.” A Sprint spokeswoman declined to comment. Industry executives and analysts said T-Mobile has shown that it can go it alone, giving it leverage as it enters any discussions. “We want to be a global leader in this space,” Ray said. “That’s the plan and now the capability we have for T-Mobile.” ",6012017,http://www.reuters.com/article/t-mobile-ma-network/rpt-t-mobiles-expanded-network-has-rivals-and-suitors-taking-notice-idUSL1N1IY01B

At an investor conference in May, T-Mobile Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said Sprint’s spectrum was a “treasure trove that you could do amazing things with.” A Sprint spokeswoman declined to comment.  Industry executives and analysts said T-Mobile has shown that it can go it alone, giving it leverage as it enters any discussions.  “We want to be a global leader in this space,” Ray said. “That’s the plan and now the capability we have for T-Mobile.”  ",6012017,http://www.reuters.com/article/t-mobile-ma-network/t-mobiles-expanded-network-has-rivals-and-suitors-taking-notice-idUSL1N1IQ1VM

362,CHTR,"Charter, Comcast explore wireless partnership with Sprint: sources","(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp is in talks with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp about a partnership to boost the two U.S. cable companies’ wireless offerings, according to sources familiar with the matter. Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday. A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other’s consent. Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011. Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the negotiations, also said that Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. Such a deal would allow Sprint to invest more in its network, the newspaper added. One of the sources said that a minority equity investment was being discussed but that it may not be part of any deal. Charter and Comcast could also look at jointly acquiring Sprint, but that is unlikely, the sources added. Sprint, Comcast and Charter declined to comment. An agreement with the cable providers over its network does not mean Sprint may not also seek a merger agreement with T-Mobile, which is controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG, the sources said. Sprint sees the partnership as increasing competition in the market, which should help alleviate any antitrust concerns over a merger with T-Mobile, the source added.  Investors have long expected a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless service providers, anticipating cost cuts and other synergies in the range of $6 billion to $10 billion.

371,CHTR,Sprint launches new leasing options for cost-conscious consumers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp said on Friday that it was launching new leasing options aimed at price-sensitive customers who want to upgrade their phones more often, the carrier’s latest effort to lure subscribers in an oversaturated market for wireless service.   The No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier will now allow customers to lease any phone and have the option to upgrade it after a year. Previously, the option was only available for Apple Inc iPhones and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s Galaxy devices. At 18 months, customers can either return their old phones and upgrade to new ones or purchase their devices. Those who want to buy their phones can pay the remaining amount in a lump sum or in six monthly increments. “We want to give full flexibility to our customers because you don’t want to get stuck with an old phone,” Robert Hackl, Sprint’s senior vice president of leasing, said in an interview. The changes come at a time when the U.S. wireless market is becoming increasingly competitive, and carriers are battling each other to lure customers through new deals. Verizon Communications Inc in February reintroduced unlimited data plans for the first time in more than five years.  Earlier this year, Sprint began offering five lines of unlimited data for $90, cheaper than competitors’ plans. In June, it launched a promotion for free unlimited data, talk and text for a year for customers who bring their own devices.  Sprint is the only carrier that leases devices to customers, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.  “It’s about lowering the cost for the consumer,” he said. “What’s in it for the carrier is people with new devices are happier. They are getting access to the new capabilities of the network.” The company, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp , is believed to be exploring a tie-up with rival T-Mobile US Inc. Sprint has also entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp on a wireless deal that would allow the cable companies to use its network.  “Considering that they’re more in an M&A; mindset, they need a growing company,” Entner said, of Sprint executives. “Nothing draws more customers into the door than low prices.” ",7142017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-leasing/sprint-launches-new-leasing-options-for-cost-conscious-consumers-idUSKBN19Z0FB

380,CHTR,Charter Communications says 'no interest' in buying Sprint,"(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Charter Communications Inc said on Sunday it was not interested in acquiring U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp, leaving the latter’s majority owner, SoftBank Group Corp, pondering how to orchestrate a merger. A merger of Charter and Sprint would create a telecommunications powerhouse, providing a one-stop shop for customers looking for internet and mobile phone services, and giving the combined company a stronger footing in creating the infrastructure required for so-called 5G wireless technology. SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is considering making an acquisition offer for Charter, which has a market capitalization of $101 billion and another $60 billion in debt, as early as this week, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday, in what would be by far the Japanese telecommunications conglomerate’s biggest ever deal. SoftBank remains interested in merging Sprint with T-Mobile US Inc, another U.S. wireless carrier controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG, with which Sprint held deal negotiations earlier this year, the source added. The source asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. SoftBank declined to comment. “We understand why a deal is attractive for SoftBank, but Charter has no interest in acquiring Sprint,” a Charter spokesman said in an emailed statement on Sunday. He declined to comment on whether Charter would entertain a bid from SoftBank and at what price. Sprint and T-Mobile could not be immediately reached for comment. SoftBank’s potential bid for Charter would follow the conclusion of two months of negotiations with Charter and larger cable peer Comcast Corp over Sprint potentially serving as their mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), allowing them to use its network to offer wireless services. “We have a very good MVNO relationship with Verizon Communications Inc and intend to launch wireless services to cable customers next year,” the Charter spokesman said. SoftBank’s interest in Charter also shows it is looking for alternatives to strengthen its negotiating hand in Sprint’s negotiations with T-Mobile, analysts said. “This could be a way to gain leverage in a T-Mobile deal,”  Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said of Son’s pursuit of Charter on Sunday.  To be sure, a bid for Charter by SoftBank, which has a market capitalization of 9.9 trillion yen ($90.3 billion), would be a stretch for its finances, given that it would likely be without the deployment of the $100 billion technology-focused investment fund called Vision Fund it raised this year. Sprint’s market capitalization is just $32.8 billion, and it has a similar amount in debt. A bid for Charter that would give SoftBank majority control in a deal would require raising tens of billions of dollars in new debt and could push SoftBank to leverage some of its other assets, including its 29.5 percent stake in Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and its 43 percent stake in Yahoo Japan Corp. SoftBank shares were trading down 2.7 percent at 8,920 yen on Monday morning in Tokyo. Another hurdle for SoftBank would be the price expectations of Charter’s largest shareholder, John Malone’s Liberty Broadband Corp. Charter’s proxy statement to its shareholders in March showed that CEO Tom Rutledge has compensation incentives to take Charter’s share price to more than $564. Charter shares ended trading on Friday at $370.26. What is more, were Charter to agree to a merger with Sprint, it would need the blessing of Comcast. Charter and Comcast announced an agreement in May that bars either company from entering into a material transaction in wireless for a year without the other’s consent. Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, also expressed interest in a takeover of Charter earlier this year, sources have said. Verizon, which has a healthier network than Sprint, has MVNO agreements in place with both Charter and Comcast, which are rolling out wireless plans for their customers using the Verizon partnership. Three years ago, SoftBank abandoned talks to acquire T-Mobile for Sprint amid opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators. That deal would have put SoftBank in control of the merged company, with Deutsche Telekom becoming a minority shareholder. T-Mobile was worth around $30 billion at the time, but its market value has since risen to more than $50 billion as it overtook Sprint as the No. 3 wireless carrier by subscribers.  While Sprint’s customer base has also grown under CEO Marcelo Claure and financials have improved, the growth was primarily driven by heavy price discounts. Despite new investment, the company’s network is still viewed by many consumers as weaker than its rivals. Unless Sprint can clinch a merger with a peer, these investment requirements are set to become more pressing. Carriers will need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade to 5G networks that promise to be 10 times to 100 times faster than current speeds.

Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, which controls Sprint, proposed a complex transaction that would create a new company and be controlled by SoftBank, the sources said. “We understand why a deal is attractive for Softbank, but Charter has no interest in acquiring Sprint,” the spokesman said in an email to Reuters on Sunday. Charter has a good mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon Communications Inc and intends to launch wireless services to cable customers next year, the spokesman added. MVNOs do not own networks, and instead rent capacity from established operators to sell on to their customers, usually at low prices due to their small overheads, with cheap distribution through the internet or convenience stores.

383,CHTR,Charter surges as Japan's SoftBank considers bid,"(Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc’s shares surged to a record high on Monday after a source said Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp was considering an acquisition offer, even as Charter shot down the possibility of it being the acquirer in any merger with SoftBank’s U.S. wireless carrier, Sprint Corp.       A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday that SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is considering making a bid for Charter as soon as the end of August, in what would be by far the Japanese telecommunications conglomerate’s biggest ever deal.  Charter has a market capitalization of more than $100 billion and another $60 billion in debt. The bid would be at least 50 percent in cash and the rest in stock, the source said. SoftBank is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG and Mizuho Financial Group Inc on raising debt financing for its bid, sources close to the matter said. It may enlist more banks in the future, the sources added. The prospect of a Sprint-Charter tie-up comes at a time when the telecom industry is preparing for a wave of deal activity. Regulators lifted a ban on merger discussions among telecom companies following the conclusion of an auction of broadcaster airwaves for wireless use in April.  Analysts and investors have said that tie-ups between cable companies and wireless carriers increasingly make sense as the distinction between broadband and wireless connectivity blurs, and consumers demand seamless connections for their devices. Cable companies have the infrastructure that wireless carriers need for the growing amounts of mobile data customers are using. Cable companies could benefit from ownership of cellular networks as they launch their own mobile services. Charter is currently planning to launch its own wireless service on Verizon Communications Inc’s network next year, and analysts have said that renting a network from a wireless carrier will be more costly long term than owning one.   Sprint, which is in the middle of a turnaround plan, has been looking to boost its financial status and better compete amid a fiercely competitive and saturated market for wireless service. The company has been exploring deal options with T-Mobile US Inc but faces the hurdle of reaching an agreement on price as well as getting the deal approved by regulators. Both companies have said they are open to other partners. Charter’s shares closed at $391.91, up 5.8 percent, after hitting a record high of $399.95. Sprint shares closed down 2.9 percent to $7.98. A Charter spokesman declined to comment on Monday on whether the company would sell to the wireless carrier. A deal between the two could be complex and disruptive, analysts said, noting financing issues, complicated ownerships and the possibility of upending existing partnerships. Investors said a deal with Sprint would be negative for Charter bondholders as it would likely increase leverage significantly. JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick wrote in a research note that a base case scenario would assume a $500-a-share bid for Charter, paid for with $20 billion of new cash from SoftBank and $40 billion of new debt. The deal could drive $2 billion in annual synergies, but he noted that SoftBank could lever Charter up significantly. A deal could also nullify part or all of Charter’s network resale agreement with Verizon. It would also require the blessing of cable provider Comcast Corp. Comcast and Charter announced a wireless partnership in May aimed at finding cost savings as both companies enter the wireless market with their own mobile services. That agreement bars either company from tying up with a wireless carrier for a year without the other company’s consent.

384,CHTR,"UPDATE 5-Sprint hints at deal prospects, shares surge","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp (S.N) shares jumped 11 percent on Tuesday after its chief executive said an announcement on merger talks should come in the “near future” and the company reported a quarterly profit for the first time in three years.  The No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier, majority owned by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), is exploring options including a merger with rival carrier T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) as well as a tie-up with cable provider Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O).  It is also in the middle of a turnaround plan and has sought to strengthen its balance sheet to compete in a saturated market for wireless service.  While Sprint has cut costs, analysts have said the company is highly leveraged. And although its customer base has expanded under Chief Executive Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by heavy discounting.  On the company’s post-earnings conference call, Claure said that while Sprint could sustain itself, the synergies that could come with a transaction were significantly better than remaining a standalone entity.   He would not give specifics on merger discussions, adding Sprint would leave doing so to an announcement that “should be coming in the near future.” “We have plenty of options, and we’ve had discussions with a lot of different parties,” he said.  He said he was surprised Charter said it was not interested in acquiring Sprint given Sprint was never offered for Charter to buy. Rather, he said, it was part of the “bigger play that has been reported.” A person familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this week that SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is considering making an acquisition offer for the cable company to combine it with Sprint as early as the end of August. The deal would entail SoftBank buying the Sprint shares it does not already own, the source said. [nL4N1KM1T1] “The talks with T-Mobile have been encouraging, the talks with other partners have been encouraging,” Claure told reporters. “Everybody has shown a high level of interest in evaluating Sprint as a potential merger partner.” Shares rose 89 cents to close at $8.87 on the New York Stock Exchange. The public nature of Sprint’s various merger discussions could pose a risk, said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.  “The obvious risk in so openly courting one potential suitor after another is that Sprint will increasingly be viewed as damaged goods,” he said in a research note. Sprint said it cut its cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses by about $370 million in the quarter and that it expects an additional $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of year-over-year reductions in fiscal 2017.  The company reported net income of $206 million, or 5 cents per share in the first quarter ended June 30, compared to a loss of $302 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. Net operating revenue was $8.16 billion, up from $8.01 billion. Analysts, on average, expected a net loss of 1 cent per share on revenue of $8.11 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sprint added 88,000 subscribers who pay a monthly phone bill in the quarter, compared to 173,000 net additions in the year-earlier period.

387,CHTR,Deutsche Telekom says any U.S. merger has to create real value,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Any merger that Deutsche Telekom may enter into in the United States must deliver real value in terms of synergies, its finance chief said when asked why it was proving so difficult to strike a deal with Sprint or another party. “It depends on how sure you can be to really get out the synergies you have on a piece of paper,” Thomas Dannenfeldt told analysts on a call after Europe’s biggest telecoms provider reported second-quarter earnings on Thursday. Fourth-biggest U.S. wireless carrier Sprint said on Tuesday an announcement on merger talks should come in the “near future”. It has been exploring a merger with Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile US as well as with cable provider Charter Communications.  Deutsche Telekom on Thursday repeatedly refused to comment on the current situation. But Dannenfeldt said in-market consolidation did in general offer opportunities, and a mobile-to-mobile merger was the easiest way of creating synergies. T-Mobile US has previously tried and failed to merge with U.S. network operators AT&T; and Sprint. It merged with Texas-based MetroPCS in 2014. Deutsche Telekom has wavered at times over the years about its commitment to remaining in the U.S. market. T-Mobile US is now its primary growth and profit driver.

390,CHTR,"UPDATE 2-Japan's SoftBank turns in strong Q1, mulls Uber investment","TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), a prolific investor in global technology startups, reported a sharp rise in quarterly profits and said it would be interested in parking funds in ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] or Lyft Inc in the future. This is the first time Softbank has publicly indicated an interest in Uber, after having so far put funds into its rival Grab in Southeast Asia and China’s Didi Chuxing. Last month, a media report said Uber shareholders and its board were mulling a stock sale to SoftBank and other investors. “We are interested in discussing with Uber, we are also interested in discussing with Lyft, we have not decided which way,” SoftBank’s CEO and founder Masayoshi Son said.  “Whether we decide to partner and invest into Uber or Lyft, I don’t know what will be the end result,” he told reporters at SoftBank’s first-quarter earnings briefing on Monday. SoftBank said its quarterly operating profit rose 50 percent from a year ago to 479 billion yen ($4.32 billion) after it included Vision Fund, the world’s largest private equity fund, as a new reportable segment and booked a 105 billion yen gain on its stake in graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA.O).  Vision Fund, backed by investors including Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, Apple (AAPL.O) and Foxconn (2317.TW), has raised more than $93 billion. Its backers expect technology investments that will match or beat the 44 percent internal rate of return that SoftBank says Son has delivered by investing in internet firms in the last 18 years. Longer term “if all goes well Vision Fund should contribute several hundred billion yen in annual revenue”, Son said.  Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate puts SoftBank’s full-year profit at 1.16 trillion yen, based on estimates from 20 analysts. SoftBank, however, has not released a forecast for the current business year ending March, citing uncertainty. SoftBank’s wireless unit Sprint Corp (S.N), the No.4 U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, is exploring options to boost finances through means such as a merger with T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) or a tie-up with cable provider Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O). Sprint, in which SoftBank has about an 80 percent stake, last week reported a quarterly profit for the first time in three years as a result of cost-cutting efforts. “There are multiple possible business consolidation partners and negotiations are ongoing,” Son said. He did not comment further as an announcement was likely in the “near future”. SoftBank shares ended up 2.4 percent before the quarterly results were announced, versus a small 0.5 percent gain in the wider index .N225 ",8072017,http://www.reuters.com/article/softbank-group-results/update-2-japans-softbank-turns-in-strong-q1-mulls-uber-investment-idUSL4N1KT2CI
391,CHTR,UPDATE 4-Altice weighing takeover offer for Charter -sources,"(Reuters) - Netherlands-based telecom conglomerate Altice NV (ATCA.AS) and its U.S. cable unit are in the early stages of working on an offer to buy Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O), sources told Reuters on Wednesday, in a move that would build more scale in the United States. A wave of consolidation is expected in the telecom industry as cable companies seek additional ways to cut costs and grow with more U.S. consumers cutting their cords. A deal for Charter would allow Altice’s founder, Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, to bring his business model to bear in the United States. Drahi made his fortune through debt-fueled acquisitions swiftly followed by cost cutting to boost profits. “Altice management fundamentally believes that U.S. cable...margins should be substantially higher than where they are at currently, which along with a willingness to put high leverage on (Charter) underpins what could be a relatively aggressive bid,” said Jeff Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research, said in an email.  Shares of Charter rose 2.9 percent to close at $400.90 after the news, first reported by CNBC. Altice USA Inc (ATUS.N) shares were up 4 cents at $31.09. Altice USA’s initial public offering in June was viewed as a means for Drahi to expand his U.S. cable empire by giving the company public stock it can use as currency for acquisitions. In May, Drahi told reporters that he considered cable expansion a priority, followed by mobile and content.  Financing an acquisition of Charter or a merger of the company with Altice USA would be a major challenge for Drahi, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $14 billion. Even without a takeover premium, Charter is worth more than $180 billion including debt, while Altice NV and Altice USA have almost as much debt as their combined market capitalizations, of 32 billions euros and $23 billion, respectively.  “Given (Charter’s) newfound scale after its own recent acquisition of the former Time Warner Cable, a full takeout seems somewhat of a tall order for any potential suitor,” said Tuna Amobi, an analyst at CFRA Research.   Altice is working with banks to finance the deal through cash and equity, a source said.   Altice NV, Altice USA and Charter declined to comment. Buying another cable company would give Altice USA, currently the fourth-biggest U.S. cable provider, the opportunity to build more scale and save on costs associated with content production, distribution rights and infrastructure investments. Altice completed its $17.7 billion acquisition of Cablevision last June, after buying Suddenlink for $9.1 billion in 2015. Both acquisitions were done through debt, with targeted cost savings of more than $1 billion for both entities. Its U.S. shopping spree followed the purchase of rival French mobile telecommunications firm SFR in 2014, which was financed with $21.9 billion-equivalent in debt, raising concerns among credit rating agencies and analysts. SFR has lost more than 1.6 million mobile customers and 500,000 fixed broadband customers since Drahi took control of the company, hampered by a late ramping up of crucial investments in its networks. Altice could have competition for Charter. Reuters reported last month that Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) was also considering making a bid for Charter as early as the end of August, looking to combine the cable company with wireless carrier Sprint Corp (S.N), of which SoftBank owns a majority stake. Analysts and investors have said tie-ups between cable companies and wireless carriers make more sense now that the distinction between broadband and wireless connectivity has blurred and consumers want seamless connections for their devices.

392,CHTR,France's Altice weighing takeover offer for Charter -CNBC,"Aug 9 (Reuters) - French telecom giant Altice NV and its U.S. cable unit are working on an offer to buy Charter Communications Inc but are yet to submit a proposal, CNBC reported, citing people close to the situation. Shares of Charter Communications were up 1 percent at $393.50, while those of Altice USA Inc were marginally lower at $30.93. With $60 billion in debt and an expected purchase price of about $500 per share or more, Charter’s enterprise value may be about $200 billion, CNBC reported. Altice USA has a market capitalization of about $23 billion as of Tuesday’s close, much smaller than Charter’s $116 billion, according to Reuters data. The French telecom company faces significant hurdles in crafting a deal that will meet shareholders’ expectations on price, CNBC added. Altice USA’s IPO in June was viewed as a means for its founder, Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, to expand his U.S. cable empire by giving the company public stock it can use as currency for new acquisitions.

394,CHTR,Charter bid would be a deal too far even for Drahi,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - A takeover of Charter Communications would be a deal too far even for Patrick Drahi. The billionaire’s Altice and its U.S. arm are working on a bid for the $180 billion cable group, according to reports. The hefty price tag and Charter shareholder John Malone’s probable unwillingness to take stock with poor voting rights may scupper that. It makes sense to combine Charter, the second-biggest U.S. cable company, with smaller peer Altice USA. The enlarged group could slash high fixed costs and have greater clout in negotiations with content providers.  Structuring the deal, though, would be hard. Imagine Drahi follows his typical strategy of loading up on debt for a cash offer and subsequently taking an axe to the cost base. The combined group could have net debt of $232 billion, assuming Altice pays a premium of 25 percent. That would be 11 times the firms’ combined 2018 EBITDA, according to Eikon forecasts. Drahi would need to more than double EBITDA to bring it down to a reasonable level, if he can raise the debt in the first place. A mix of a cash and shares is therefore the most likely option, but even then it’s hard to see how a deal could satisfy the interests of Drahi and Charter shareholders, including John Malone, whose Liberty Broadband owns more than a fifth of Charter shares. The groups’ uneven market capitalisations mean a straightforward merger with equal rights would force Drahi to surrender control. Altice USA is more likely to offer its A-shares, which have inferior voting power. But Charter shareholders would still be left with less say in a company carrying more debt than the roughly four times EBITDA they currently have. That would take a lot of confidence in Drahi and his cost-cutting skills. True, Malone, known as the “cable cowboy”, has called him a “genius”. Perhaps Drahi could win Malone round by offering him shares with superior voting rights than those offered to other shareholders. But Charter, which recently bought Time Warner Cable, probably has other more attractive options if it wants to acquire companies or gear itself up. It’s hard to see the cable cowboys forging a transatlantic connection.",8102017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-altice-m-a-breakingviews/charter-bid-would-be-a-deal-too-far-even-for-drahi-idUSKBN1AQ1LV

400,CHTR,Viacom launches TV ads in dispute with Charter,"(Reuters) - Viacom Inc (VIAB.O), parent of networks including MTV and Nickelodeon, launched TV ads this week urging its viewers to call customer service at cable company Spectrum ahead of a deadline that may result in a costly blackout for 16.6 million customers.  The current deal between Spectrum parent Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Viacom, expires Oct. 15. The looming deadline prompted Viacom to issue a statement on Wednesday warning of a possible disruption because distribution talks between the two companies had stalled.. The warning spooked investors, who pushed shares of Viacom down 3 percent to $24.45 in midday trading. The negotiations with Charter come at a delicate time for Viacom, which is in the midst of a turnaround plan to improve ratings and ad revenue under CEO Bob Bakish, who took on his role last year.  Like its peers, Viacom is struggling to keep viewers as more people watch shows on smartphones and tablets. Six of the largest U.S pay TV providers posted a total of 723,000 subscriber losses during the past quarter. Of that total, Charter reported 90,000 subscriber losses.   Viacom could lose $760 million, or 16 percent, of its annual affiliate revenue, if Charter drops all 23 of its channels, said Brett Harriss, an analyst at Gabelli & Co, the second largest owner of voting shares of Viacom after Sumner Redstone.   On Wednesday night, Viacom started running ads on Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET, featuring talent for each network warning viewers of the possible disruption in service and urging them to call Spectrum.  The New York-based media company has also launched a site, “keepviacom.com.”  Tens of thousands of viewers have called Spectrum to complain, Viacom said. A Charter spokesman declined to comment. Despite the high stakes for Viacom, investors seem optimistic that Charter and Viacom will reach a deal. “Viacom has 15-20 percent of all cable viewership,” said Sal Muoio, whose firm is the 10th largest owner of controlling shares of Viacom. “You would think Charter would want them.” Still, the dispute points to the need for Viacom to gain scale. Perhaps Viacom should revisit a merger with CBS Corp (CBS.N), which the two explored last year, said Harriss. In remarks last week, controlling shareholder Shari Redstone alluded to the importance of scale when asked about merging CBS and Viacom.

The warning spooked investors, who pushed shares of Viacom down 3 percent to $24.45 in midday trading. The negotiations with Charter come at a delicate time for Viacom, which is in the midst of a turnaround plan to improve ratings and ad revenue under CEO Bob Bakish, who took on his role last year.  Like its peers, Viacom is struggling to keep viewers as more people watch shows on smartphones and tablets. Six of the largest U.S pay TV providers posted a total of 723,000 subscriber losses during the past quarter. Of that total, Charter reported 90,000 subscriber losses.   Viacom could lose $760 million, or 16 percent, of its annual affiliate revenue, if Charter drops all 23 of its channels, said Brett Harriss, an analyst at Gabelli & Co, the second largest owner of voting shares of Viacom after Sumner Redstone.   On Wednesday night, Viacom started running ads on Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET, featuring talent for each network warning viewers of the possible disruption in service and urging them to call Spectrum.  The New York-based media company has also launched a site, “keepviacom.com.”  Tens of thousands of viewers have called Spectrum to complain, Viacom said. A Charter spokesman declined to comment. Despite the high stakes for Viacom, investors seem optimistic that Charter and Viacom will reach a deal. “Viacom has 15-20 percent of all cable viewership,” said Sal Muoio, whose firm is the 10th largest owner of controlling shares of Viacom. “You would think Charter would want them.” Still, the dispute points to the need for Viacom to gain scale. Perhaps Viacom should revisit a merger with CBS Corp (CBS.N), which the two explored last year, said Harriss. In remarks last week, controlling shareholder Shari Redstone alluded to the importance of scale when asked about merging CBS and Viacom.

Viacom said it had made a series of offers for a deal with Charter but could not meet the conditions asked by Charter. “While we’re making every effort to reach a new deal, Charter’s actions may force a disruption in Spectrum subscribers’ service,” Viacom said in a statement. The current deal between Charter and Viacom expires Oct. 15, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be identified. A blackout would hit 16.5 million subscribers.  A spokesman for Charter declined to comment. Earlier this year, Charter moved Viacom’s flagship networks to its most expensive programming tier, a move that threatened the media company’s affiliate and advertising revenue. This marks the first major affiliate dispute for Viacom since CEO Bob Bakish took over last year. Bakish has made it a priority to improve relations with distributors.

422,CHTR,LPC: Meredith’s Time buy helps lift US media lending to 11-yr high,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. media group Meredith Corp’s planned purchase of Time Inc is the latest in a run of mergers that have boosted media lending to the highest point in more than a decade as the sector regroups to fight online content providers.  Meredith said it would buy Time, the Sports Illustrated and People magazine publisher, on November 26 in a deal valued at US$2.8bn including debt, backed by US$3.55bn of committed bank financing and a US$650m preferred equity commitment from Koch Equity Development. Nearly US$94bn of investment-grade and leveraged loans have been provided to media companies so far this year, including deals that are completed and in process, up from US$59bn in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.  Media companies’ quest for more and varied content, combined with relaxed restrictions on network ownership and liquid banks keen to provide funding are driving the mergers, which are expected to accelerate, bankers and attorneys said.  “The big old guard is trying to find ways of providing content as the wave of the future,” an M&A; attorney said. The US$94bn figure, which includes new money and a robust stream of refinancing deals, is the highest media volume since US$117bn in 2006, the data shows.  Acquisition loans accounted for more than a quarter of this year’s total, for the biggest share since 68% in 2015. Volume two years ago was skewed by sizable deals including US$30bn for Charter Communications Inc’s buy of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks LLC. Relatively low asset prices are helping to spur merger decisions by traditional media companies which are keen to stay competitive with highly successful online streaming services including Netflix Inc and Amazon.com. Meredith said the tie-up adds the content creation of strong national brands to a powerful local television business, expanding the reach of advertisers. “The pace of media M&A; is picking up and will probably accelerate over the next couple of years, as bigger and more diversified companies will have more negotiating leverage,” a banker said. “Everything’s on the table now.”  Comcast Corp, Verizon Communications and Walt Disney Co separately indicated interest in buying assets from Twenty First Century Fox Inc in recent weeks.  Discovery Communications said it was buying Scripps Networks Interactive for US$14.6bn over the summer, supported by a US$9.6bn 364-day bridge loan to finance the purchase. Media mergers this year included Sinclair Broadcast Group, which said it would acquire Tribune Media Co for US$3.9bn in May. The move followed a vote by the Federal Communications Commission to reverse a 2016 decision that limited the number of television stations some broadcasters could buy. “Sinclair’s acquisition of Tribune was, in part, driven by expectations that the rules would be relaxed around station ownership and market concentration,” another banker said.  “There continues to be an expectation that there will be consolidation, particularly in a regulatory environment that is friendlier, at least on the broadcast side,” he added.  Earlier in November, the FCC also voted to remove a 42-year-old ban on cross ownership of a TV station and a newspaper in a major market, among several changes that could open the door to new deals among TV, radio and newspaper owners that are seeking to better compete with online media, Reuters reported. The unsettled US$85.4bn AT&T; Inc purchase of Time Warner Inc is, however, still lurking in the background after the US Department of Justice sued AT&T; to block the deal on November 20.  President Donald Trump has frequently criticized Time Warner’s CNN news division and during the presidential election said that this merger would put too much power in AT&T;’s hands. Uncertainty about the outcome of this deal, which was first announced in October 2016, “puts a monkey wrench” in the media and telecom merger spree, the first banker said.  Nonetheless, the motivation and momentum for media mash-ups will persist, he said. “You don’t want to be left as the small, odd guy out, without negotiating power.” ",11292017,http://www.reuters.com/article/media-lending/lpc-merediths-time-buy-helps-lift-us-media-lending-to-11-yr-high-idUSL1N1NZ1WZ

425,CHTR,NY judge rules Charter Communications must face lawsuit over slow internet,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc must face a lawsuit by New York’s attorney general accusing the cable company of providing customers slower-than-advertised internet speeds, a New York state judge ruled. Justice O. Peter Sherwood of the state Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected Charter’s claim that Attorney General Eric Schneiderman failed to plausibly allege the company had short-changed and misled customers. He also rejected Charter’s claim that federal law pre-empted the lawsuit. The Feb. 13 decision was made public on Friday. Schneiderman accused Charter’s Spectrum unit, previously known as Time Warner Cable, of having systematically defrauded customers since 2012, including by creating an impression they would consistently get fast internet speeds. The attorney general said at least 640,000 subscribers signed up for high-speed plans but got slower speeds, and many subscribers could not access promised content such as Facebook, Netflix, Google’s  YouTube and gaming platforms. He also accused Time Warner Cable of leasing older-generation modems to 900,000 subscribers, knowing they could not generate faster internet speeds. In a statement, Spectrum spokesman John Bonomo said the company “delivers its advertised internet speeds,” and will continue to vigorously contest Schneiderman’s claims about practices at Time Warner Cable, which Charter bought in 2016. Sherwood rejected Charter’s claims that its advertising was not misleading because the company had promised to provide speeds only “up to” particular levels, and reasonable consumers would understand that could mean slower speeds were possible. The judge said the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, had rejected this argument in another case where, as Schneiderman alleged, the advertised speeds were “functionally unattainable as a result of the defendants’ knowing conduct.” Sherwood said while there may have been “literal truth” to Charter’s advertising claims, this was not a defense “where, as here, the claims create a false ‘net impression.’” Schneiderman called the decision a “major victory” for consumers. He said the lawsuit, which seeks restitution and civil fines, will proceed toward a possible trial. “The allegations in our lawsuit confirm what millions of New Yorkers have long suspected - Charter-Spectrum has been ripping you off,” the attorney general said in a statement. The case is New York v Charter Communications Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 450318/2017.

436,CHTR,Charter shares set for worst day on steep video subscriber loss,"(Reuters) - Shares of Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) were on track for their worst day since going public in 2009 after the cable company saw a sharp drop in video subscribers in the first quarter.        Charter lost 112,000 video customers in the quarter, twice the number analysts expected, according to financial data analytics firm FactSet. Cheaper online video streaming options are pushing customers to cut the cord, hurting cable service providers such as Charter and its bigger rival Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).   Earlier this week, Comcast said it lost higher-than-expected video subscribers in the first quarter. Shares of Charter were down 16 percent, dragging down other pay-TV companies such as Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), Altice USA (ATUS.N) and Comcast, whose shares fell as much as 7 percent.  “These lighter subscriber results could be interpreted as an indication that the competitive landscape has changed, requiring a shift in (Charter’s) strategy,” Evercore analyst Vijay Jayant wrote in a note. The company has multiple levers to pull - including  pricing and promotion to still drive robust long term free cash flow growth, however, the question is whether that growth is going to be driven by a different mix of those levers, Jayant said. Charter’s internet business grew at a rapid pace, adding 362,000 subscribers in the quarter and reporting a 9.1 percent rise in revenue. Net income attributable to Charter shareholders rose to $168 million, or 70 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $155 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier.   Revenue rose 4.9 percent to $10.66 billion. Analysts on average expected earnings of 52 cents per share on revenue of $10.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the Stamford, Connecticut-based company have fallen 11.3 percent since the beginning of the year.
