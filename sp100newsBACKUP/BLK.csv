3,BLK,Domestic havens best bet in 2011 as resource funds slide," * Resource funds among biggest fallers to June-end   * Japan, UK, U.S. funds insulated from world worries rise   * Uncertainty about growth looms over second half of 2011    LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - A series of macroeconomic shocks — from the euro zone debt crisis to May’s commodity sell-off — combined to hit funds tied to the world economy in 2011, giving funds better insulated from global growth the chance to shine. 	   Equity funds invested in resource-related equities — like mining, metals or oil and gas stocks — were among the worst performers in the first half of 2011, Lipper data showed, hit by sudden price drops in May and continued global growth worries.	   This has hurt some of the sector’s best-known managers — like JP Morgan Asset Management’s Ian Henderson and BlackRock’s Evy Hambro — with losses unlikely to be reversed until waning appetite for the sector changes.	   By contrast, domestic-focused funds invested in Japan, the UK or the U.S. equity markets, have proved the biggest gainers, posting double-digit returns as consumer and internet stock sectors ride out macroeconomic concerns overseas.   	   According to Lipper data, which covers the 3,000 plus funds registered for sale in Britain, among the worst performers are the SUNARES Sustainable Natural Resources Fund, co-managed by Colin Moor and Udo Sutterluety, which fell 21.41 percent, and JP Morgan AM’s Global Natural Resources Fund, down 15.16 percent.	   Commodity markets sold off quickly in early May. Oil LCOc1 lost up to $13 a barrel at one point on May 5 and silver  fell 12 percent on the same day, rattling investor confidence.	   Even accounting for the sector-wide falls, some of these funds have failed to keep pace with their competitors.	   JP Morgan’s Global Natural Resources Fund has underperformed its natural resource equity fund peers more than 6.7 percentage points, while its Natural Resources Fund by 8.65 percentage points, according to the Lipper data.	   BlackRock’s $17.8 billion World Mining Fund, run by star manager Evy Hambro, has also underperformed, falling 5.33 percent during the period, 4.3 percentage points more than its peers, the data showed.	   Neil Gregson, portfolio manager for JP Morgan’s Natural Resources Fund alongside Henderson, said his funds’ relative exposure to small caps had hurt performance, while investor appetite — and particularly retail — continued to be hit hard by May’s sell-off.	   Some resource funds may have seen redemptions as recently as June, he added. Without a rebound in sentiment, flows will not start to pick up again and returns could stay weak.	   “There’s not many people out there banging the case for resource equities and everybody can understand why one would be cautious given global macro views,” Gregson said. 	   Other poor performing sectors in the first half of the year included funds focused on Turkish and Indian equities.	   At the other end of the performance tables funds buying stocks that rely on domestic consumption for growth have proved the biggest risers.	   Legg Mason’s Japan Equity Fund was the fourth largest gainer - up 15.65 percent - and the biggest outperformer of all funds, beating its Japan equity fund peers by more than 21 percent.	   Hideo Shiozumi, the fund’s manager, says a focus on fast-growing internet and social media stocks has helped the fund steer through volatility brought by March’s earthquake.	   The return of the domestic investor, which has neglected small caps recently, will provide an added boost to the sector for the rest of 2011, he said. 	   “This time recovery and outperformance should be stronger than before,” Tokyo-based Shiozumi told Reuters.	   Other top performers include Cazenove’s UK Smaller Companies Fund, run by Paul Marriage, up 19.41 percent, and the Dynamic Power American Growth fund, the fifth-biggest riser, up 15.63 percent, the data shows.	   The latter fund, which invests in mid to large cap shares in the U.S., has focused on the consumer discretionary and technology sectors with a core of 20 to 25 growth stocks, Noah Blackstein, its portfolio manager, said.	   Blackstein says the U.S. market, relatively insulated from headwinds elsewhere in the world, will continue to provide a relatively strong economic backdrop to support growth stocks.	   “Believe it or not the U.S. probably looks like one of the more solid markets on a global basis. A lot of the issues that were plaguing the U.S. in terms of the banking system they have been dealt with,” Blackstein said.	   “Europe hasn’t even got there yet, nor do they have the mechanisms to get there,” he said.

4,BLK,IFR-US CREDIT-Bondholders take backseat to shareholders," by Timothy Sifert  NEW YORK, July 8 (IFR) - The increase in shareholder-friendly activity among investment-grade bond issuers has bondholders concerned that their interest might not be at heart in the boardrooms of their portfolio companies.  US corporations have generally weathered the credit crisis with aplomb, socking away historically high levels of cash. But in many cases executives’ fiscal conservatism has been at the expense of growth, and therefore at the expense of shareholders.  As new opportunities open up many companies are changing their tack, rewarding shareholders with stock repurchaseS, higher dividends and, at times, acquisitions. In this case, what’s good for equity investors isn’t great for bond holders.  So far it has been the better-capitalised credits that have been spending, and bond investors haven’t complained much as a result. But should the shareholder-friendly trend continue on pace, there’s reason to worry.   “I’m surprised bondholders aren’t more concerned about this,” said one head of investment grade syndicate in New York.  There have been a slew of share-repurchase deals this year already, totalling about US$24.8bn and including trades from blue chip names Blackrock (BLK.N), Philip Morris International (MO.N), Best Buy (BBY.N), Coca-Cola (KO.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).  Indeed bondholders have said they are concerned about their holdings, but they say it’s not a market-wide problem. Only select names are guilty.  A Fitch report released last week suggests as much. The rating agency sought to highlight which investment grade companies might be most prone to institute shareholder-friendly policies in the future.  The report looked at metrics that might indicate a company would want to engage in share repurchases, restructurings, spinoffs, among other plans that are potentially damaging to bondholders. Borrowers with low ratios of enterprise value to EBITDA versus their high-grade peers, for example, might be acquisition targets or might pursue other potentially leveraging actions to boost the ratio.  The report highlights tens of borrowers. But to illustrate the thrust of the thesis it looked at RR Donnelley (RRD.N), the only company in the report without investment grade ratings. In May, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P downgraded RR Donnelley to junk.  “This company illustrates what can happen to ratings when cyclicality, long-term structural challenges, and accelerated share repurchases collide,” according to the report.  RR Donnelley is currently engaged in a US$1bn buyback programme it expects to complete next year. In addition, the rating agencies expect the company to pursue debt-financed acquisitions to get ahead in the slowing-moving printing sector.  Best Buy is another credit bondholders should be wary about. On June 27, Fitch downgraded the retailer two notches to BBB- in part because the retailer announced a new US$5bn share repurchase and a dividend increase. In March, Best Buy completed a US$650m 5.50% 10-year note at plus 200bp and a US$350m 3.75% five-year note at 162.5bp to fund the repurchase. The 10-year was quoted on TRACE at plus 249bp earlier this week.  Best Buy, like RR Donnelley, has opted to reward shareholders somewhat aggressively despite having many real challenges ahead.  “The company’s business profile faces amplified headwinds from same-store sales, market share, and competition,” Fitch wrote in the report.  Another borrower Fitch expounded on was Expedia (EXPE.O). The agency put the borrower’s ratings on negative watch in April after the company said it planned to spin off TripAdvisor to shareholders. If the divestiture goes ahead, existing bondholders will be left owning a weaker credit. Stockholders, though, will be better off.  Expedia was last in the US dollar bond market on August 2 last year. It printed a US$750m offering of 5.95% 10-year notes to yield plus 300bp. This week it was quoted on TRACE at plus 323bp.

5,BLK,"UPDATE 1-Asset managers under pressure, study finds"," * hunt for return forces asset managers to up ante   * Assets under management boosted by rising markets   * High profit margins reduce merger pressures  (Adds comment from industry expert, details, recasts first sentence)   By Ross Kerber   BOSTON, July 11 (Reuters) - Investors’ increasingly aggressive hunt for returns will put pressure on asset managers to boost performance could prompt outflows from those unable to raise their game, according to research released on Monday.   The conclusions, outlined in a study released by Boston Consulting Group, could be sobering for an industry long used to rich profit margins, even as its recovery from the financial crisis continued last year.   Assets managed by the industry grew 8 percent to $56.4 trillion globally in 2010, albeit at a slower pace than the 13 percent gain recorded in 2009, according to BCG. At its peak in 2007, the industry managed $56.2 trillion in assets.   But gains over the last two years were mainly due to rising equity markets rather than new inflows of cash from investors, the key measure of success for big fund companies.   Also, as fresh inflows waned, the financial crisis focused investors’ minds on returns and performance, said Gary Shub, a BCG partner and one of the study’s co-authors.   “Investors are willing to pay active managers only if they’re going to outperform the market,” he said. “The headline is that the investor has become more demanding.”   The result will be something of a barbell-shaped industry, Shub said, with the best performing companies at one end, drawing more assets, while the worst performers will see outflows or, at best, slow growth.   (For a breakdown of Global assets under management click here: r.reuters.com/tub62s )   Profit margins, which had peaked at 39 percent in 2007, just before the financial crisis hit, continued to recover as well. BCG said margins across the industry rose to 33 percent last year from 31 percent in 2009.   The study did not make forecasts for specific companies, but the dynamic described by Shub already appears under way: companies with mixed performance records have reported steady outflows in recent quarters, including Janus Capital Group Inc JNS.N and AllianceBernstein Holding LP. (AB.N)   Both companies have reported a string of outflows in recent quarters, including outflows of $2.7 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively, in the three months ended March 31. They are in the middle of turnaround efforts and have said investors should expect better flows as results improve.   Other asset managers, whose funds have achieved better returns, have posted inflows, including Franklin Resources Inc (BEN.N) and T. Rowe Price Group Inc (TROW.O). During the same quarter, they saw inflows of $8.4 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively.   The companies with the largest inflows in the United States in 2010 were closely held vanguard group inc and fidelity Investments, as well as the Pimco unit of Allianz Global Investors, according to BCG.   While the report said the consolidation process among asset managers is set to continue, Shub said BCG does not see much pressure for big deals that would rival such recent tie-ups as BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) $13.5 billion purchase of the iShares ETF business from Barclays Plc (BARC.L) in 2009.   For one thing, the industry’s comfortable margins reduce the pressure on companies to sell out even when they struggle to attract new client money. And as distributors, such as the brokerages that sell mutual funds, continue to slim down the menu of funds they offer, buying the underlying fund managers becomes increasingly less attractive for potential buyers.   Eric Weber, chief operating officer of Freeman & Co, a New York financial services mergers-and-acquisitions advisor, said the fat profit margins typical for the industry further reduced the pressure on weaker players to exit the business.   “A lot of companies out there would kill to have 32 percent margins,” he said.   The BCG study said that, as investors seek higher returns and lower costs, the industry would continue to find growth in alternative and passive products at the expense of actively managed funds. Meanwhile, the shift of assets into high-growth emerging markets such as China and elsewhere in Asia will gather pace.   For instance, 33 percent of European institutional investors planned to raise the share of assets allocated to Asian equities in 2011, and 41 percent planned to raise the share of equities they hold in other emerging markets, BCG found.   Shub said the consulting group expected the U.S. market to continue making up nearly half the world’s asset management space for years to come, given its sheer scale: $27.6 trillion in 2010, up from $25.5 trillion in 2009.   In comparison, Asia, excluding Japan and Australia, accounted for $2.9 trillion in assets under management in 2010, up from $2.6 trillion in 2009.   Still, developing markets will provide much of the industry’s growth in coming years. Despite choppy markets, assets under management in China, Brazil and India grew at rates well above 10 percent from 2007 to 2010, BCG said.

9,BLK,Judge's ruling extends Mosaic's Florida mine woes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge has extended an order keeping Mosaic Co (MOS.N) from expanding a Florida phosphate mine, dealing yet another blow to the fertilizer producer and pushing its stock down 5.2 percent.  The company said it would fight the ruling and a related lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club, an environmental group that claims Mosaic’s mine operations in South Fort Meade, Florida, damage two watersheds.  The mine has about 15 years of phosphate reserves and produces 6.5 million tons of the fertilizer each year. That represents a third of Mosaic’s yearly phosphate capacity and 4 percent of the world’s.  At issue is a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that would let Mosaic expand the mine’s size.  The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida put that permit on hold last year. In April, Mosaic said it would expand phosphate mining at South Fort Meade anyway, but not in wetland areas.  From Mosaic’s perspective, the injunction applied only to wetland mining, and it was free to mine.  That move appeared to irk Judge Henry Lee Adams Jr., who said in a ruling late Friday that the mining expansion “alters the course of this very complicated case.”  “Any harm to Mosaic is largely self-inflicted,” Adams said in his ruling. Mosaic has had ample time since the beginning of the lawsuit to reapply for necessary permits, he said.  Mosaic rival CF Industries (CF.N) has a mine near the South Fort Meade complex and has been spared legal scrutiny, largely because it has not tried to expand production.  CF Industries CEO Steve Wilson said last May that he was benefiting from Mosaic’s headache.  “The biggest advantage that we have is that Mosaic went first,” Wilson said. He said that when he does try to expand his own production, he will have a “difficult task.  Plymouth, Minnesota-based Mosaic said its pretax costs will likely jump by $200 million in 2012 because of the injunction.  The company said it will be able to support planned finished phosphate fertilizer production levels through 2012, helped by phosphate rock inventories, higher output from other mines and supplemental purchases of phosphate rock from third parties.  Mosaic processes mined phosphate rock into pebble and fine phosphate, which are turned into diammonium phosphate, or DAP. That is what farmers use in their fields.  During a Reuters reporter’s tour of the facility in 2010 before the initial injunction, the company touted the facility’s water remediation design, saying it complies with federal and state regulations.  The Sierra Club claims Mosaic’s permit to operate does not take into account the damage the water causes.  The company uses draglines — giant cranes with booms the length of football fields — to scoop sediment comprising clay, sand and phosphate about 100 feet deep. Using a series of washes, the phosphate rock is separated from the clay and sand and sent by train for processing.  The facility reuses about 98 percent of its water and employs giant retaining ponds to separate clay and sand from water, Mosaic said.  Alligators, wrens, cranes and other wildlife live in or near the retaining ponds.  In the retaining ponds, clay and sand sink to the bottom. The water is deposited into the Peace River watershed, and the clay and sand deposits are turned into orange groves, swampland or forests. However, some retaining ponds have breached in the past, leaching clay sediment.  The South Fort Meade facility employs more than 200 workers.  If the Florida mine closes — a step that is improbable but not impossible — the world’s phosphate supply would tighten, boosting prices for crops.  “The court’s ruling is inconsistent with the overall regulatory environment in Florida and may bring significant hardship to our employees and local communities,” Richard Mack, Mosaic’s general counsel, said in a statement. “Mosaic continues to stand by the validity of the Army Corps’ permit.”  Mosaic’s shares were down 5.2 percent to $66.93 in morning trading.  Mosaic is set to report its quarterly results on July 18.  Big agribusiness company Cargill CARG.UL recently spun off its majority stake in Mosaic.

11,BLK,Bondholders take backseat to shareholders,"NEW YORK, July 8 (IFR) - The increase in shareholder-friendly activity among investment-grade bond issuers has bondholders concerned that their interest might not be at heart in the boardrooms of their portfolio companies.  U.S. corporations have generally weathered the credit crisis with aplomb, socking away historically high levels of cash. But in many cases executives’ fiscal conservatism has been at the expense of growth, and therefore at the expense of shareholders.  As new opportunities open up many companies are changing their tack, rewarding shareholders with stock repurchases, higher dividends and, at times, acquisitions. In this case, what’s good for equity investors isn’t great for bond holders.  So far it has been the better-capitalized credits that have been spending, and bond investors haven’t complained much as a result. But should the shareholder-friendly trend continue on pace, there’s reason to worry.  “I’m surprised bondholders aren’t more concerned about this,” said one head of investment grade syndicate in New York.  There have been a slew of share-repurchase deals this year already, totaling about US$24.8bn and including trades from blue chip names Blackrock, Philip Morris International, Best Buy, Coca-Cola and Microsoft.  Indeed bondholders have said they are concerned about their holdings, but they say it’s not a market-wide problem. Only select names are guilty.  A Fitch report released last week suggests as much. The rating agency sought to highlight which investment grade companies might be most prone to institute shareholder-friendly policies in the future.  The report looked at metrics that might indicate a company would want to engage in share repurchases, restructurings, spinoffs, among other plans that are potentially damaging to bondholders. Borrowers with low ratios of enterprise value to EBITDA versus their high-grade peers, for example, might be acquisition targets or might pursue other potentially leveraging actions to boost the ratio.  The report highlights tens of borrowers. But to illustrate the thrust of the thesis it looked at RR Donnelley, the only company in the report without investment grade ratings. In May, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P downgraded RR Donnelley to junk.  “This company illustrates what can happen to ratings when cyclicality, long-term structural challenges, and accelerated share repurchases collide,” according to the report.  RR Donnelley is currently engaged in a US$1bn buyback program it expects to complete next year. In addition, the rating agencies expect the company to pursue debt-financed acquisitions to get ahead in the slowing-moving printing sector.  Best Buy is another credit bondholders should be wary about. On June 27, Fitch downgraded the retailer two notches to BBB- in part because the retailer announced a new US$5bn share repurchase and a dividend increase. In March, Best Buy completed a US$650m 5.50% 10-year note at plus 200bp and a US$350m 3.75% five-year note at 162.5bp to fund the repurchase. The 10-year was quoted on TRACE at plus 249bp earlier this week.  Best Buy, like RR Donnelley, has opted to reward shareholders somewhat aggressively despite having many real challenges ahead.  “The company’s business profile faces amplified headwinds from same-store sales, market share, and competition,” Fitch wrote in the report.  Another borrower Fitch expounded on was Expedia. The agency put the borrower’s ratings on negative watch in April after the company said it planned to spin off TripAdvisor to shareholders. If the divestiture goes ahead, existing bondholders will be left owning a weaker credit. Stockholders, though, will be better off.  Expedia was last in the US dollar bond market on August 2 last year. It printed a US$750m offering of 5.95% 10-year notes to yield plus 300bp. This week it was quoted on TRACE at plus 323bp.

12,BLK,New York probes Bank of America $8.5 billion mortgage pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York’s attorney general is investigating Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) $8.5 billion settlement with investors over losses in mortgage-backed securities, and has sought data from 20 institutional investors that agreed to the accord.  In letters to the firms, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman requested the names of various clients — including pension funds, government authorities and charities affiliated with the state — that invested in securities issued by the 530 mortgage securitization trusts covered in the accord. He also sought the par and current market values of the clients’ securities.  The letters are dated July 7, and were sent in connection with the attorney general’s “ongoing investigation” into the securitization of residential mortgages. Schneiderman requested that the information be provided by July 14.  Among the investors were BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), MetLife Inc (MET.N) and Allianz SE’s (ALVG.DE) Pacific Investment Management Co. Of the 22 investors that agreed to the accord, only the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Banks were not sent letters by Schneiderman.  Schneiderman’s office and representatives of Bank of America and BlackRock declined to comment. A MetLife spokesman said that insurer has not seen a letter from Schneiderman. Pimco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Reuters obtained copies of the letters on Tuesday.  Various attorneys general are scrutinizing the causes of and fallout from excess in mortgage securitizations, a key driver of the recent housing and financial crises.  Regulators including all 50 state attorneys general are also working on an expected multi-billion dollar settlement with large mortgage servicers over foreclosure practices.  The $8.5 billion settlement announced June 29 was part of roughly $20 billion of charges that Bank of America hopes will resolve much of its legal liability from its 2008 purchase of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp.  But the accord has drawn challenges from some Countrywide mortgage securities investors who question whether the accord is fair, or may provide some investors with windfalls.  The settlement requires approval by New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan.  In court filings this week, the institutional investors rejected various criticisms by a group of pension funds and 11 companies sharing the name Walnut Place, which own Countrywide securities in some trusts covered by the accord.  The institutional investors called “ludicrous” a claim that they engineered a gentle settlement to help Bank of America, which many of them regularly do business with in other areas.  They also said that to exclude some trusts from the accord would deprive investors in those trusts of other benefits, including servicing improvements that could lead to fewer foreclosures and higher values for their mortgage securities.  On Monday, Congressman Brad Miller, a Democrat and member of the House Financial Services Committee, questioned whether taxpayers might end up on the hook for excessive losses through the ownership by government-run Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB of securities covered in the settlement.

14,BLK,Bank of America seeks to restore trust in IPO market,"LONDON (Reuters) - A string of troubled initial public offerings (IPO) in Europe has pushed Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) to draw up a set of new guidelines to improve the listing process and restore confidence between sellers and buyers.  The investment bank, the second-biggest equity fundraiser globally in the first half of the year and the fourth in Europe, said the suggestions were aimed at increasing disclosure and transparency in the market.  “There has been a lot of disappointment ... We are suggesting that all of us involved in IPOs have to do their part to contribute to improving the process,” Craig Coben, the bank’s the bank’s head of equity capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told Reuters.  “Distrust has seeped into the process ... we need to move beyond finger-pointing and find ways to make the process better.”  Among Bank of America’s suggestions, sent out in a document to clients late on Monday, are earlier and more regular meetings between institutional investors and company management.  It also called for full disclosure of fees paid to underwriters and advisers, and greater transparency on how performance fees are calculated.  More than 20 European IPOs have been pulled this year amid volatile equity markets and investors, who have lost money on almost all floats which did get done, increasingly lack the conviction to take a punt on new listings.  The ideas put forward by the bank address many of the issues raised by U.S.-based fund manager BlackRock (BLK.N) in a letter to investment banks in May, which illustrated the strained relationship between banks, advisers, investors and issuers.  “We should be comfortable with disclosing who is getting paid what and disclosure of fees will restore some trust. People want to know what fees are being paid to banks and advisors and on what basis those fees are being paid,” said Coben.  An investigation into equity underwriting fees by Britain’s Office of Fair Trading earlier this year concluded that there was insufficient price competition in the market, although its probe excluded the IPO process.  The OFT also refrained from stepping into the market, saying it was up to companies and institutional shareholders to drive competition.  Differences in opinion between selling shareholders and potential investors about what a company is worth have been a particular sticking point on many floats this year.  The bank pointed out companies should be aware they may have to float at a discount to listed peers, the extent of which will be influenced by factors such as market conditions, the firm’s size and specific sector or geopolitical risks.  Other proposals made by the bank included allowing independent analysts, from banks not involved in an IPO, access to information on the company to provide a greater balance of research for investors.  Large book running syndicates, long a point of contention in the market, need to be better managed to make sure the leading banks on a deal take greater ownership and responsibility for its success, the proposal said.  Where independent advisers are involved in a float, there should be greater clarity on their role, it added.  “These advisers need to ensure that they give no cause to be perceived by the market as, and do not inadvertently act as, a force for conflict in a sensitive process,” the document states.  Coben said investors had so far responded positively to the suggestions.  “People will agree with some of the points and others may be points of debate. We want to stimulate a more open and constructive debate ... to date we really haven’t had an open dialogue among the parties involved.

16,BLK,Six FHLB banks challenge BofA mortgage pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Six of the Federal Home Loan Banks and another investor are seeking to intervene in Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion settlement with investors in soured mortgage-backed securities, signaling growing opposition to the accord.  FHLB branches in Boston, Chicago, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Seattle said they have gotten “very little information” to help decide whether the settlement with the largest U.S. bank is fair.  They said they paid more than $8.8 billion, a sum exceeding the entire settlement amount, for securities in 73 trusts backed by home loans from Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008.  Meanwhile, the investor TM1 Investors LLC said it may sue to force Bank of America to buy back its securities, which it said were once worth more than $400 million.  The opposition was expressed in filings on Wednesday in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. It means at least four investors or investor groups are preparing challenges.  Eric Schneiderman, the state attorney general, has asked most of the 22 institutional investors joining the settlement — including BlackRock Inc, MetLife Inc and Allianz SE’s Pacific Investment Management Co — for details about the accord, a sign he may challenge it as well.  The $8.5 billion settlement covers mortgages with a $174 billion unpaid principal balance, about 5 cents on the dollar.  Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment. David Grais, a lawyer for the home loan banks and TM1, also declined to comment.  In their filings, the six home loan banks and TM1 said they are unconvinced that Bank of New York Mellon Corp, trustee for the 530 mortgage pools covered in the settlement, adequately protected their rights in negotiating the accord.  “After much investigation, TM1 believes that many of the loans that Countrywide sold to the trust in which it owns securities did not comply with the representations and warranties” Grais wrote.  “As a result,” he added, “TM1, together with one or more investors in the same trust, is considering legal action on behalf of that trust to enforce Countrywide’s obligation to repurchase those defective loans.”  The 12 federal home loan banks offer financing and grants to help members make mortgage and small business loans, and foster economic development.  One, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, is among the 22 investors that signed on to the Bank of America settlement.  “The federal home loan banks operate independently,” said Sharon Cook, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta bank. “We support the settlement, and the right of other federal home loan banks to further evaluate it.”  Other objections to the accord have come from companies known as Walnut Place LLC, which Grais’ firm represents, and from a group of public pension funds that said some investors could get a “windfall.  If the settlement wins court approval, affected investors would not be allowed to “opt out.” Walnut Place would have to drop its February lawsuit against Bank of America over its securities, once worth $1.06 billion.  New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan scheduled a November 17 hearing on the settlement.

David Grais, a lawyer for the home loan banks and TM1, also declined to comment.   In their filings, the six home loan banks and TM1 said they are unconvinced that Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), trustee for the 530 mortgage pools covered in the settlement, adequately protected their rights in negotiating the accord.   “After much investigation, TM1 believes that many of the loans that Countrywide sold to the trust in which it owns securities did not comply with the representations and warranties” Grais wrote.   “As a result,” he added, “TM1, together with one or more investors in the same trust, is considering legal action on behalf of that trust to enforce Countrywide’s obligation to repurchase those defective loans.”   The 12 federal home loan banks offer financing and grants to help members make mortgage and small business loans, and foster economic development.   One, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, is among the 22 investors that signed on to the Bank of America settlement.   “The federal home loan banks operate independently,” said Sharon Cook, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta bank. “We support the settlement, and the right of other federal home loan banks to further evaluate it.”   Other objections to the accord have come from companies known as Walnut Place LLC, which Grais’ firm represents, and from a group of public pension funds that said some investors could get a “windfall.” [ID:nN1E7641N0] [ID:nN1E7651UN]   If the settlement wins court approval, affected investors would not be allowed to “opt out.” Walnut Place would have to drop its February lawsuit against Bank of America over its securities, once worth $1.06 billion.

20,BLK,"BlackRock bullish on Latam economies, middle class","BOGOTA (Reuters) - BlackRock, one of the world’s largest fund managers, is bullish on Latin America and does not expect major market issues to surround the presidency in Peru of Ollanta Humala, the fund’s regional manager said on Monday.  “Latin American markets ... are becoming self sustainable in the sense that they have enough middle class and demand locally to grow,” Daniel Gamba, head of BlackRock operations for Latin America and Iberia, told Reuters.  “We also know that a lot of the trading activity on our markets is happening not only with Europe and the U.S. but most importantly with Asia. We feel good about that,” he said in an interview in Bogota, Colombia’s capital.  Latin America has seen a surge in foreign investments into its capital markets over the last few years as emerging market economies, with higher interest rates, grow faster than developed nations.  “We feel that if we continue to see this development of the middle class, if we continue to see this booming of commodities — which we think will continue — we think that Latin America will continue to have (stronger) growth,” he said.  That view on the region’s markets helps Gamba stay bullish even about a possible U.S. debt default, with just five days to go before U.S. President Barack Obama’s deadline for a debt deal.  Gamba did not detail BlackRock’s investing plans in the region in the event of a credit default in the United States.  “We think in the end it is going to work out for the best (interest) of the U.S. economy. Obviously we have different plans depending on different scenarios, but we think that the situation is going to work out,” he said.  Gamba rang the opening bell on Monday of the Colombian exchange, which alongside bourses in Chile and Peru, recently formed the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA).  The terms of the exchange are being reviewed by Peru’s leftist President-elect Ollanta Humala, a move that has unnerved some foreign investors.  “We’ve said before that the situation in Peru was ‘wait and see’ the signals of the new government,” said Gamba.  “All the signals that I’ve seen point that (Humala) will maintain the current model,” he said. “I think the new government will continue to promote the local capital markets, and MILA is crucial for the local capital markets.”  Gamba, in Bogota for the launch of the first local exchange-traded fund (ETF), said the Colombian ETF is the result of growing local demand. He said BlackRock has close to $5 billion from local investors.  “It was Colombian investors who approached BlackRock to say ‘We want this product, we want this product locally launched, we want this product locally listed,’ “ Gamba said.  The ETF, iCOLCAP, which started trading two weeks ago, is indexed to the local blue-chip COLCAP index, and its components will be the 20 most liquid shares.  A similar ETF, the Global X FTSE Colombia 20 denominated in dollars, trades on U.S. exchanges.  “Initially the fund will be developed locally.” he said. “Once liquidity gets to a point that it will compete to any ETF that is listed in New York, then investors will make their own decisions.”  When asked about the view of some foreign investors that Colombia is overpriced, Gamba said that BlackRock has a “slightly positive” view on Colombia among Latin American markets.  “Our position in Colombia is neutral to positive,” he said. “There are names that are attractive, and we will continue to invest in Colombia.”  ",7182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock/blackrock-bullish-on-latam-economies-middle-class-idUSTRE76H4RP20110718

23,BLK,"PREVIEW-Q2 exposes asset management skills, deficits"," * Franklin, AMG, BlackRock seen reporting solid results   * Outflows feared at Legg Mason, Janus, AllianceBernstein   * Winner/loser divide widens, analysts say   * Asset managers to begin reporting on July 20   By Ross Kerber   BOSTON, July 19 (Reuters) - Volatile stock markets in the just-ended quarter separated the haves from have nots in the world of asset management, according to analysts.   Blackrock Inc (BLK.N), which kicks off the earnings season for asset management companies on Wednesday, joined competitors such as Franklin Resources Inc (BEN.N) and Affiliated Managers Group (AMG.N) in attracting new assets from investors — largely by posting strong returns in many of their funds — analysts estimate.   Weaker results are forecast at AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB.N) and Janus Capital GroupJNS.N, which have been battling lower-tier returns in many of their equity funds in recent quarters. U.S. stock markets, after a strong April and May, retrenched in June, leading many investors to transfer funds to more stable fixed-income products and international funds.   “Stepped-up market volatility seems to be driving a more clearly defined separation between the winners and losers,” Sandler O’Neill analyst Michael Kim wrote in a recent report to the firm’s clients.   Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average expect Blackrock to report adjusted earnings of $2.88 per share, up from $2.37 per share in the same period a year earlier. (The figures exclude costs from acquisitions and compensation plans).   Franklin, which reports its fiscal third quarter results on Aug. 2, is expected to see earnings jump to $2.15 a share from $1.58 a year ago, boosted in part by the strong performance of portfolio manager Michael Hasenstab. His Templeton Global Bond fund and Templeton Global Total Return fund accounted for $2.2 billion of the $2.9 billion that flowed into world bond offerings in June, according to Morningstar.   Affiliated Managers Group(AMG.N), a holding company that acquires boutique asset managers and allows them to operate with much autonomy, is also expected to report an upbeat second-quarter profit of 81 cents, up from 53 cents a year earlier and 74 cents in the first quarter of 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding special items, AMG is expected to earn $1.65 per share, up from $1.35 a year ago and $1.60 in the first quarter. Earnings are set for July 26.   AMG benefited from strong returns in its fixed-income mutual funds: 69 percent of these assets were in funds that were in the top half of performers over the three years ending May 31, according to Kim. The company’s equity managers have not kept pace. Only 46 percent of mutual fund assets have been in funds with top-half performance over three years, Kim found.   Investors betting on asset managers have similarly seen mixed results. Shares of Franklin and AMG over the 12 months ended on Monday were up 39 percent and 54 percent respectively—besting the 12 percent gain for the same period of the Dow Jones U.S. Asset Manager Index.DJUSAG. BlackRock shares were up 20 percent in the period on the strong growth of its exchange-traded fund business.   The index has been dragged down by results at Legg Mason Inc (LM.N), down 7 percent over the past year, an 11 percent fall at Janus and a 35 percent decline at AllianceBernstein.   The companies have largely been known more for stock funds than than on fixed-income and have struggled to staunch client exits from equities since the financial crisis that began in 2008. Each company has installed a new chief executive since that year.   Analysts expect Baltimore-based Legg Mason to report on July 28 a profit of 36 cents a share for its first fiscal quarter ended June 30, up from 30 cents a year ago but down from 45 cents a share in this year’s March quarter. Legg, which last reported net inflows into its funds in September 2007, has already signaled that its assets under management fell to $663 billion as of June 30 from $678 billion on March 31.   The withdrawals likely came in money funds and sovereign-wealth funds, said Citigroup analyst William Katz, who still rates Legg shares a “buy” based on valuation factors.   Janus last reported net inflows of money from investors in the second quarter of 2009. Analysts expect Janus to earn 23 cents a share for this year’s second quarter, up from 17 cents a year ago. It earned 21 cents in the first quarter, on a three-cent debt retirement charge. The company is scheduled to report on July 21.   The picture may look toughest for AllianceBernstein. On July 12 it reported that total assets in June fell $12 billion to $461 billion from the end of May. The company last reported an inflow of cash firmwide in the fourth quarter of 2007, though it is diversified and its retail and private client segments reported positive flows during early quarters of 2010.   Analysts polled by Thomson I/B/E/S expect AllianceBernstein to report second-quarter earnings of 41 cents per ownership unit on July 29, up from 31 cents per unit a year earlier but down from 42 cents in the first quarter.

24,BLK,Growth moves pay off for BlackRock's Fink in Q2,"BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest money manager by assets, marshaled a rapidly growing list of fund styles and asset classes to post a 43 percent jump in second-quarter profit, topping expectations.  The New York-based company has long been known as a fixed-income institutional manager, but CEO Laurence Fink has pressed into new areas such as exchange traded funds and multi-asset products. Both took in healthy inflows of cash from investors in the three months ended June 30.  Net income rose to $619 million, or $3.21 per share, from $432 million, or $2.21 a share, a year earlier, BlackRock reported on Wednesday. Adjusted earnings were $3.00 a share, topping analysts’ average forecast of $2.88, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Assets under management were $3.659 trillion at June 30, up 16 percent from a year earlier and up 0.3 percent from the end of the first quarter.  Fink said the results showed his emphasis on new areas is paying off. On a conference call with analysts, he said BlackRock’s broad product mix will lead to a deeper relationship with clients and drive revenue and profits.  “That is our strategy. And our strategy has shown in the second quarter that it is working,” Fink said. Many clients are looking for longer-term guidance amid uncertain world markets, and “no other firm in the business is as well positioned for that type of dialogue,” he added.  Analysts agreed BlackRock’s gains reflected its wide range of products, allowing growth in volatile markets.  “This is a company that I would expect to continue to hit singles and doubles,” said Calyon Securities analyst Chris Spahr, using a baseball analogy. “There are not going to be many swings and misses because they’re so big.”  BlackRock shares finished trading up 0.44 percent, at $184.50. The company is the first large publicly traded asset manager to report second-quarter earnings and continued a good run. In the 12 months that ended Tuesday, BlackRock shares rose 20 percent. That bested several smaller managers with poorer results, or more known for equity funds, that have had trouble attracting assets. For instance, Janus Capital Group JNS.N shares are down 11 percent over the same period, while AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB.N) is off 35 percent.  BlackRock said it had about 9,700 employees as of June 30, up from 8,500 a year earlier.  In a note to investors, Ticonderoga Securities analyst Douglas Sipkin wrote that BlackRock’s scale means it is not as dependent on inflows of cash as rivals. “BLK is no longer a play on flow momentum, although we do believe organic growth trends will head higher throughout the year,” he wrote.  Investors added a net $18.4 billion to BlackRock’s long-term funds in the second quarter, excluding outflows in money funds, specialized portfolios and merger-related flows.  As at other fund companies, volatile markets during the quarter meant BlackRock faced both market depreciation and net redemptions from some stock funds. Outflows from its active equity products totaled $8.9 billion.  But investors added money in most other areas. BlackRock’s popular iShares exchange traded funds took in $11.6 billion, up 11 percent from the first quarter. Investors added $20.7 billion to multi-asset class products, which BlackRock said reflected demand for fiduciary and asset allocation services.  In an afternoon interview broadcast on CNBC, Fink said there is still a case for stocks. Corporate results over the past week have shown “some very good earnings numbers across the board,” and that with higher earnings and the major indices not rising in response, “the market has become relatively cheaper.”  Stocks also offer investors a way to diversify against the political risk posed by policy uncertainty in any given country, he added.  Debates like the one in Washington over whether to raise the U.S. debt ceiling are causing many investors to “freeze” in uncertainty and not make new investments, Fink said. “You’re seeing across the board a slowdown in decision making,” he said.  For Fink, 58, the string of strong results shows the growing influence of the company he helped found in 1988. Initially, the company was the money management arm of the large BlackStone private equity firm; it was spun out in 1995.  Merrill Lynch later came to own almost half of BlackRock, and in 2007 there were reports that Merrill had spoken to Fink about bringing him in as CEO of the investment bank. That never came to pass, and Fink rode out the financial crisis at a company with little subprime exposure.  On Wednesday’s conference call, Fink and BlackRock Chief Financial Officer Ann Marie Petach said BlackRock has reported the last of outflows stemming from the company’s 2009 purchase of Barclays Global Investors, a milestone analysts had expected.  Separately, Petach said BlackRock has signed a new lease to move employees in London from two buildings into one, and expects to move most employees during the third quarter. The move will lead to a charge of $75 million to $100 million in the second half, she said.

27,BLK,Countrywide investors may be owed $27.5 bln-filing," * Six FHLB banks have said settlement may be unfair   * $8.5 billion settlement to resolve Countrywide claims   By Jonathan Stempel   NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) may have to pay $27.5 billion to reach a fair settlement with investors in soured Countrywide mortgage-backed securities, more than three times the $8.5 billion it agreed to pay, a group of Federal Home Loan Banks said.   In a Thursday filing in a New York state court, the banks said expert reports used as support for the settlement by Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), the trustee for the 530 covered mortgage pools, “raise more questions than they answer” and may be based on false assumptions.   FHLB branches in Boston, Chicago, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Seattle paid more than $8.8 billion for securities in 73 trusts backed by home loans from Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008.   They and several other investor groups are seeking more details about whether the $8.5 billion accord announced last month is fair before deciding whether to challenge it.   The accord covers mortgages with a $174 billion unpaid principal balance, and is intended to resolve much of Bank of America’s remaining legal liability tied to Countrywide.   Eric Schneiderman, the New York state attorney general, has asked most of the 22 institutional investors that joined the accord for more details, a sign he may challenge it as well.   Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank believes the trustee acted appropriately in entering the settlement, and conducted “extensive due diligence” prior to doing so. Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment.   In their filing, the home loan banks said the expert reports have “little value” because they appear to have been written in hindsight after the settlement was reached.   They questioned in particular one report by Brian Lin, a managing director at mortgage strategist RRMS Advisors, that called a $8.8 billion to $11 billion payout “reasonable.”   According to the banks, Lin, in examining the trusts, may have understated the number of expected defaults, the ability to recover loan principal via foreclosures, and the number of loans that Bank of America should repurchase.   If the bank were forced to buy back all loans that were in default and which breached Countrywide’s representations and warranties, rather than the 40 percent Lin estimated, “then Mr. Lin’s estimate of a reasonable settlement would rise from a range of $8.8 to $11 billion to a range of $22 billion to $27.5 billion,” the filing said. “Modifying any of his other three assumptions would cause that range to rise much more.”   Lin did not immediately return a call seeking comment.   The 12 federal home loan banks offer financing and grants to help members make mortgage and small business loans, and foster economic development. The Atlanta home loan bank is among the 22 investors that signed on to the accord.   New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan scheduled a Nov. 17 hearing on the settlement.

28,BLK,"Pension funds, investors urge action on US deficit"," BOSTON, July 26 (Reuters) - Some of the largest U.S. pension funds and investment firms have urged President Barack Obama and Congress to resolve the deficit impasse and avoid inflicting “pain and hardship” on the nation.   In an open letter to Obama and lawmakers dated July 25, top officials from ten pension funds and plan sponsors urged an increase in the debt ceiling, but more so of the need to reduce the massive federal budget deficit and avoid a potential downgrade of the U.S. by credit agencies.   Investment firms BlackRock Inc. (BLK.N) and Legg Mason (LM.N) signed a similar letter July 25 as part of a coalition of 14 large public and private investors.   “The idea of America losing its AAA rating was once unthinkable, but now highly likely if our leaders fail to act,” the letters said. “The consequences of such a downgrade are very real and very serious.”   “Our country faces threats to its economic well-being that will inflict pain and hardship on all our citizens for many years if we fail to act — and act now.”   The United States, as a debtor nation, must show that its word is its bond, the investment groups said.”   “It is critical that the debt ceiling be raised to avoid a default. But raising the debt ceiling just addresses the immediate problem of default. The huge budget deficit, both current and long-range, is the real problem.”   The letters did not take a position on how the United States should achieve deficit reduction: through spending cuts, tax increases or a combination of measures.   The ten state and local government pension funds represent more than 7.7 million active and retired workers — teachers, firefighters and others with combined assets of over one trillion dollars.   The signatories included CALPERS, the huge California government pension system; the Florida State Board of Administration; and the New York City Retirement System.   Both groups warned of the risk of rising inflation and higher interest rates that would come with a U.S. ratings downgrade, especially if the U.S. dollar was no longer the primary reserve currency for investors around the world.   “Economic growth for our nation will slow for years to come, and diminish the quality of living across America.”   The U.S. Treasury has said the government will start to run out of money to pay its bills by Aug. 2 unless Congress acts, but as of Tuesday there was no compromise in sight.

31,BLK,Analysis: BofA mortgage pact draws glare from NY,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four weeks ago, Bank of America Corp reached an $8.5 billion settlement it hailed as a step forward in putting mortgage liabilities behind it. But New York’s attorney general is sending strong signals he could try to reshape the deal or even scuttle it.  The settlement, which requires court approval, could provide a template for other banks hoping to settle investor claims on residential mortgage-backed securities that went bust in the financial crisis. Bank of America agreed to resolve nearly all repurchase claims tied to mortgage bonds backed by loans from its Countrywide Financial unit.  Almost as soon as the ink was dry on the pact, though, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman began to look into the deal. The investigation is part of his office’s broader examination of banks’ roles in the mortgage crisis.  The agreement was struck by trustees on 530 mortgage bonds with $174 billion in unpaid principal. It is backed by 22 big investors, including Pacific Investment Management Co and BlackRock Inc, which argued the bonds were stuffed with risky home loans that should not have been sold.  Some investors complain the pact is rife with conflicts and is a bad deal for them — although a plum one for the bank. At least four investor groups have filed court papers saying they might object to the deal.  If Schneiderman also challenges the settlement, it could have to be renegotiated — likely at a greater cost to Bank of America, analysts say. According to a court filing on Tuesday by a group of investors who oppose the deal, Schneiderman is close to deciding whether to intervene.  “The Attorney General’s office has asked us to inform the court that it is completing its analysis,” wrote David Grais, an attorney for an investor group known as Walnut Place LLC.  Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Schneiderman, declined to comment.  Critics of the settlement say Bank of New York Mellon Corp, which served as trustee for the mortgage pools covered by the settlement, secretly negotiated a deal on behalf of investors without their input. They argue BNY Mellon had a conflict of interest because it was indemnified by a Countrywide unit for costs and liabilities arising from its duties as trustee.  In his first seven months on the job, Schneiderman has embraced the title “Sheriff of Wall Street” that comes with the attorney general post, a position previously held by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer before him.  He has emerged as a key player in the negotiations between banks and state and federal regulators over alleged shoddy foreclosure practices. Schneiderman has insisted any settlement over those practices not give banks broad releases from being sued over other mortgage issues.  Under the state’s Martin Act, an expansive anti-fraud statute, Schneiderman has broad subpoena power. He could use the law to gather information to evaluate the fairness of the Bank of America deal, said Isaac Gradman, an attorney who advises investors in mortgage securities.  “He certainly has a lot of power and ability to bring to the surface unappealing information about the banks,” Gradman said. “That alone could give him leverage to have a seat at the table.”  Still, it is unclear if Schneiderman has the power to intervene. He needs permission from a court to officially insert himself into a case. If Schneiderman does not intervene on behalf of certificate holders in the soured securities, he might argue the deal does not benefit investors at large and he should be considered an interested party as their advocate.  “There are some aspects to this deal, which the attorney general may or may not consider to be in the public interest,” said Beth Kaswan, an attorney for pension fund investors seeking to intervene in the case.  In a letter to the judge on July 13, Schneiderman’s office hinted at its strategy. The office opposed an order sought by BNY Mellon that would limit intervenors to certificate holders and other interested parties, wrote special deputy attorney general Maria Filipakis.  “Such an order could have a substantial adverse impact on the interests of the State of New York,” Filipakis wrote.  BNY Mellon responded in a subsequent court filing that its proposed order is not intended to limit any interested party from seeking to intervene.  Bank of America and BNY Mellon declined to comment about the possibility of Schneiderman’s involvement in the case. Kathy Patrick, an attorney who helped negotiate the deal for investors, did not return a call seeking comment.  The settlement requires the approval of New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick, who set an August 30 deadline for objections to it.  Schneiderman has sent letters asking institutional investors who agreed to the accord for the names of their clients that have ties to New York such as pension funds and charities. The letters, obtained by Reuters, have fueled speculation Schneiderman might intervene and object to the settlement.  By asking for information, Schneiderman might be trying “to nudge some activity,” said Thomas Adams, an attorney at Paykin Krieg & Adams, who specializes in securitization issues.  The price tag ultimately could rise for Bank of America if Schneiderman exerts influence, said Chris Gamaitoni, a mortgage finance analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading.  “If they are able to subpoena information and conduct a deep analysis, that would be a negative point for the bank,” he said.  The case is In re: The Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011.

32,BLK,Fund managers seek freedom not to sell on U.S. downgrade,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some major bond fund managers are asking their institutional clients to consider waiving strict requirements that might force mass selling of Treasury bonds if the United States loses its AAA rating.  Pension funds, endowments and other large investors typically establish rules governing how their assets can be invested when they sign on with a money manager. Some analysts fear a downgrade of the U.S. rating would spark a mass sell-off because of guidelines that only permit investments in AAA-rated securities.

37,BLK,Analysis: Money funds show resilience despite debt fears,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Money market funds face uncharted waters if a debt deal is not reached soon in Washington, but Joe Morgan is not ready to abandon ship.  As Chief Investment Officer of Silicon Valley Bank’s SIVBV.UL asset management affiliate, Morgan keeps about $10 billion in money market funds, including $5 billion in government funds loaded with Treasury bills. Silicon Valley Bank is a unit of SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O).  But Morgan expects that, even if the government were forced into a technical default, officials would still find a way to pay bondholders. Money fund sponsors, meanwhile, have built up enough liquidity to convince him they could manage, even if other institutional investors yanked money out of the funds.  “Even if you have a run that takes out 40 percent of the assets, it’s business as usual” for his money fund shares, Morgan said on Friday.  It’s an important view — and one voiced by several other managers — as the $2.5 trillion money market mutual fund industry braces itself for the possibility a broad political agreement will not be reached.  In all, the funds hold about $1.3 trillion in Treasuries, agency debt and other securities backed by public institutions that to date have been regarded as safe havens. Many funds could continue to hold the debt even if there was a downgrade, analysts said. But one threat, according to Fitch Ratings, would be if investors rushed to pull money out of the funds because the government stopped renewing maturing securities.  However unlikely the chances of that, big money fund sponsors such as Fidelity Investments of Boston and Federated Investors Inc (FII.N) in Pittsburgh have moved to calm investors.  Both companies and others have held meetings with investors and sent out briefing papers. Some such as BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) have also asked clients to reconsider guidelines, such as discussing whether limits on holding debt rated less than AAA should be revised.  A Fidelity spokesman said it has stress-tested its money funds so they can withstand significant market volatility. In an emailed statement, the spokesman also said its money market funds have removed all U.S. Treasuries that mature in the first two weeks of August “to avoid volatility from the deadline” of August 2 in the Washington debt talks.  In addition, Fidelity has raised the cash positions of its Treasury money market funds. Clark Case, the treasurer for the City of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said the steps convinced him to keep assets in a Fidelity fund.  “I’m not worried about that in the money market at all,” he said.  For the fund companies, the pressure is on. Data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit, show that, for the week ended July 27, investors withdrew $32 billion from money funds, up from $22 billion in the previous week and a turnaround from the $11 billion added the week of July 13.  The outflow was the largest weekly figure since January, although still just a blip of the sector’s total assets. Tom Roseen, Lipper’s Head of Research Services, said the rising outflows could just reflect seasonal pressures, or the stalemate in Washington.  The largest weekly outflow came in the week of September 17th, 2008, when one of the best-known money funds, Reserve Primary Fund, “broke the buck” and failed to maintain the $1-per-share net asset value many investors expect. Investors withdrew $144 billion from all money funds that week.  “Let’s see what happens if the Congress does not pass a meaningful bill by next week,” Roseen said.  One investor prepared to wait and see is Rick Trout, Chief Investment Officer of West Coast Trust in Portland, Oregon. His $600 million portfolio includes around $20 million in money market funds run by managers, including Federated. Federated has reassured him of the funds’ resilience, he said.  Besides, Trout said, most investors regard the talk in Washington as policy dispute rather than a question about the government’s ability to pay bills.  “The market seems to recognize this as a political event and not related to solvency,” he added.

38,BLK,BofA legal troubles deepen as big investors sue,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) was sued by 15 former Countrywide Financial Corp institutional investors who said they lost money after being misled about the mortgage lender’s financial condition and lending practices.  BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), T Rowe Price Group Inc (TROW.O), TIAA-CREF and the other plaintiffs, including some in Europe, sued in Los Angeles federal court, after deciding not to join a $624 million settlement that won court approval in February.  These plaintiffs believed they could recover more by suing on their own over the “massive and pervasive” fraud at Countrywide, which Bank of America bought on July 1, 2008.  Thursday’s lawsuit deepens the legal problems for Bank of America over Countrywide, for which it paid $2.5 billion. Analysts have estimated that its ultimate cost, including legal bills and loan losses, could easily exceed 10 times that sum.  Last month, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank entered an $8.5 billion agreement to end most litigation by investors who bought securities backed by risky Countrywide home loans. Some of those investors have complained this agreement too may be unfair.  According to the 425-page complaint by the 15 plaintiffs, Countrywide and officials like former Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo abandoned prudent lending, reserved too little for bad loans and inflated earnings, in a drive to triple market share to 30 percent and enrich themselves.  Top executives “were fully aware of but failed to disclose, and in fact expressly authorized and engaged in, Countrywide’s risky lending,” the complaint said.  Countrywide shares ultimately sank more than 90 percent from their peak as losses from its subprime, pay-option and other risky mortgages began to pile up.  Bill Halldin, a Bank of America spokesman, said: “It is unfortunate that select investors chose to opt out of a fair and equitable agreement to settle these issues. We intend to vigorously defend these claims.”  The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and class-action status for the March 12, 2004 to March 7, 2008 period.  They are also seeking a jury trial, and to “maximize the recovery of their damages,” their lawyer Blair Nicholas, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, said.  Other defendants include former Chief Operating Officer David Sambol and former Chief Financial Officer Eric Sieracki, and former auditor KPMG LLP.  Lawyers for the former executives did not return requests for comment. KPMG spokesman Dan Ginsburg declined to comment.  The February 25 settlement approved by U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles called for Bank of America to pay $601.5 million to former Countrywide investors, and set aside $22.5 million for claims of investors that opted out.  That money would go to investors in the earlier settlement if it is not used within two years.  Mozilo last October reached a $67.5 million settlement of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil fraud lawsuit accusing him of misleading investors and generating improper gains from stock sales. He did not admit wrongdoing.  Bank of America shares have fallen close to 60 percent since it bought Countrywide, roughly three times as much as the KBW Bank Index .BKX.

39,BLK,BofA legal troubles deepen as big investors sue," * BlackRock, CalPERS, TIAA-CREF, T Rowe Price, others sue   * Bank of America to defend against Countrywide claims   By Jonathan Stempel   NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) was sued by 15 former Countrywide Financial Corp institutional investors who said they lost money after being misled about the mortgage lender’s financial condition and lending practices.   BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), T Rowe Price Group Inc (TROW.O), TIAA-CREF and the other plaintiffs, including some in Europe, sued in Los Angeles federal court, after deciding not to join a $624 million settlement that won court approval in February.   These plaintiffs believed they could recover more by suing on their own over the “massive and pervasive” fraud at Countrywide, which Bank of America bought on July 1, 2008.   Thursday’s lawsuit deepens the legal problems for Bank of America over Countrywide, for which it paid $2.5 billion. Analysts have estimated that its ultimate cost, including legal bills and loan losses, could easily exceed 10 times that sum.   Last month, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank entered an $8.5 billion agreement to end most litigation by investors who bought securities backed by risky Countrywide home loans. Some of those investors have complained this agreement too may be unfair. [ID:nN1E76C1XV]   According to the 425-page complaint by the 15 plaintiffs, Countrywide and officials like former Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo abandoned prudent lending, reserved too little for bad loans and inflated earnings, in a drive to triple market share to 30 percent and enrich themselves.   Top executives “were fully aware of but failed to disclose, and in fact expressly authorized and engaged in, Countrywide’s risky lending,” the complaint said.   Countrywide shares ultimately sank more than 90 percent from their peak as losses from its subprime, pay-option and other risky mortgages began to pile up.   Bill Halldin, a Bank of America spokesman, said: “It is unfortunate that select investors chose to opt out of a fair and equitable agreement to settle these issues. We intend to vigorously defend these claims.”   The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and class-action status for the March 12, 2004 to March 7, 2008 period.   They are also seeking a jury trial, and to “maximize the recovery of their damages,” their lawyer Blair Nicholas, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, said.   Other defendants include former Chief Operating Officer David Sambol and former Chief Financial Officer Eric Sieracki, and former auditor KPMG LLP.   Lawyers for the former executives did not return requests for comment. KPMG spokesman Dan Ginsburg declined to comment.   The Feb. 25 settlement approved by U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles called for Bank of America to pay $601.5 million to former Countrywide investors, and set aside $22.5 million for claims of investors that opted out.   That money would go to investors in the earlier settlement if it is not used within two years. [ID:nN25155293]   Mozilo last October reached a $67.5 million settlement of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil fraud lawsuit accusing him of misleading investors and generating improper gains from stock sales. He did not admit wrongdoing.   Bank of America shares have fallen close to 60 percent since it bought Countrywide, roughly three times as much as the KBW Bank Index .BKX. In afternoon trading, the shares were unchanged at $9.79.   The case is Government of Guam Retirement Fund et al v. Countrywide Financial Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 11-06239.

40,BLK,Analysis: BofA mortgage pact draws glare from NY,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four weeks ago, Bank of America Corp reached an $8.5 billion settlement it hailed as a step forward in putting mortgage liabilities behind it. But New York’s attorney general is sending strong signals he could try to reshape the deal or even scuttle it.  The settlement, which requires court approval, could provide a template for other banks hoping to settle investor claims on residential mortgage-backed securities that went bust in the financial crisis. Bank of America agreed to resolve nearly all repurchase claims tied to mortgage bonds backed by loans from its Countrywide Financial unit.  Almost as soon as the ink was dry on the pact, though, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman began to look into the deal. The investigation is part of his office’s broader examination of banks’ roles in the mortgage crisis.  The agreement was struck by trustees on 530 mortgage bonds with $174 billion in unpaid principal. It is backed by 22 big investors, including Pacific Investment Management Co and BlackRock Inc, which argued the bonds were stuffed with risky home loans that should not have been sold.  Some investors complain the pact is rife with conflicts and is a bad deal for them — although a plum one for the bank. At least four investor groups have filed court papers saying they might object to the deal.  If Schneiderman also challenges the settlement, it could have to be renegotiated — likely at a greater cost to Bank of America, analysts say. According to a court filing on Tuesday by a group of investors who oppose the deal, Schneiderman is close to deciding whether to intervene.  “The Attorney General’s office has asked us to inform the court that it is completing its analysis,” wrote David Grais, an attorney for an investor group known as Walnut Place LLC.  Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Schneiderman, declined to comment.  Critics of the settlement say Bank of New York Mellon Corp, which served as trustee for the mortgage pools covered by the settlement, secretly negotiated a deal on behalf of investors without their input. They argue BNY Mellon had a conflict of interest because it was indemnified by a Countrywide unit for costs and liabilities arising from its duties as trustee.  In his first seven months on the job, Schneiderman has embraced the title “Sheriff of Wall Street” that comes with the attorney general post, a position previously held by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer before him.  He has emerged as a key player in the negotiations between banks and state and federal regulators over alleged shoddy foreclosure practices. Schneiderman has insisted any settlement over those practices not give banks broad releases from being sued over other mortgage issues.  Under the state’s Martin Act, an expansive anti-fraud statute, Schneiderman has broad subpoena power. He could use the law to gather information to evaluate the fairness of the Bank of America deal, said Isaac Gradman, an attorney who advises investors in mortgage securities.  “He certainly has a lot of power and ability to bring to the surface unappealing information about the banks,” Gradman said. “That alone could give him leverage to have a seat at the table.”  Still, it is unclear if Schneiderman has the power to intervene. He needs permission from a court to officially insert himself into a case. If Schneiderman does not intervene on behalf of certificate holders in the soured securities, he might argue the deal does not benefit investors at large and he should be considered an interested party as their advocate.  “There are some aspects to this deal, which the attorney general may or may not consider to be in the public interest,” said Beth Kaswan, an attorney for pension fund investors seeking to intervene in the case.  In a letter to the judge on July 13, Schneiderman’s office hinted at its strategy. The office opposed an order sought by BNY Mellon that would limit intervenors to certificate holders and other interested parties, wrote special deputy attorney general Maria Filipakis.  “Such an order could have a substantial adverse impact on the interests of the State of New York,” Filipakis wrote.  BNY Mellon responded in a subsequent court filing that its proposed order is not intended to limit any interested party from seeking to intervene.  Bank of America and BNY Mellon declined to comment about the possibility of Schneiderman’s involvement in the case. Kathy Patrick, an attorney who helped negotiate the deal for investors, did not return a call seeking comment.  The settlement requires the approval of New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick, who set an August 30 deadline for objections to it.  Schneiderman has sent letters asking institutional investors who agreed to the accord for the names of their clients that have ties to New York such as pension funds and charities. The letters, obtained by Reuters, have fueled speculation Schneiderman might intervene and object to the settlement.  By asking for information, Schneiderman might be trying “to nudge some activity,” said Thomas Adams, an attorney at Paykin Krieg & Adams, who specializes in securitization issues.  The price tag ultimately could rise for Bank of America if Schneiderman exerts influence, said Chris Gamaitoni, a mortgage finance analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading.  “If they are able to subpoena information and conduct a deep analysis, that would be a negative point for the bank,” he said.",7292011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankofamerica-settlement/analysis-bofa-mortgage-pact-draws-glare-from-ny-idUSTRE76R6QP20110729
41,BLK,Analysis: Money funds show resilience despite debt fears,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Money market funds face uncharted waters if a debt deal is not reached soon in Washington, but Joe Morgan is not ready to abandon ship.  As Chief Investment Officer of Silicon Valley Bank’s asset management affiliate, Morgan keeps about $10 billion in money market funds, including $5 billion in government funds loaded with Treasury bills. Silicon Valley Bank is a unit of SVB Financial Group.  But Morgan expects that, even if the government were forced into a technical default, officials would still find a way to pay bondholders. Money fund sponsors, meanwhile, have built up enough liquidity to convince him they could manage, even if other institutional investors yanked money out of the funds.  “Even if you have a run that takes out 40 percent of the assets, it’s business as usual” for his money fund shares, Morgan said on Friday.  It’s an important view — and one voiced by several other managers — as the $2.5 trillion money market mutual fund industry braces itself for the possibility a broad political agreement will not be reached.  In all, the funds hold about $1.3 trillion in Treasuries, agency debt and other securities backed by public institutions that to date have been regarded as safe havens. Many funds could continue to hold the debt even if there was a downgrade, analysts said. But one threat, according to Fitch Ratings, would be if investors rushed to pull money out of the funds because the government stopped renewing maturing securities.  However unlikely the chances of that, big money fund sponsors such as Fidelity Investments of Boston and Federated Investors Inc in Pittsburgh have moved to calm investors.  Both companies and others have held meetings with investors and sent out briefing papers. Some such as BlackRock Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co have also asked clients to reconsider guidelines, such as discussing whether limits on holding debt rated less than AAA should be revised.  A Fidelity spokesman said it has stress-tested its money funds so they can withstand significant market volatility. In an emailed statement, the spokesman also said its money market funds have removed all U.S. Treasuries that mature in the first two weeks of August “to avoid volatility from the deadline” of August 2 in the Washington debt talks.  In addition, Fidelity has raised the cash positions of its Treasury money market funds. Clark Case, the treasurer for the City of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said the steps convinced him to keep assets in a Fidelity fund.  “I’m not worried about that in the money market at all,” he said.  For the fund companies, the pressure is on. Data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit, show that, for the week ended July 27, investors withdrew $32 billion from money funds, up from $22 billion in the previous week and a turnaround from the $11 billion added the week of July 13.  The outflow was the largest weekly figure since January, although still just a blip of the sector’s total assets. Tom Roseen, Lipper’s Head of Research Services, said the rising outflows could just reflect seasonal pressures, or the stalemate in Washington.  The largest weekly outflow came in the week of September 17th, 2008, when one of the best-known money funds, Reserve Primary Fund, “broke the buck” and failed to maintain the $1-per-share net asset value many investors expect. Investors withdrew $144 billion from all money funds that week.  “Let’s see what happens if the Congress does not pass a meaningful bill by next week,” Roseen said.  One investor prepared to wait and see is Rick Trout, Chief Investment Officer of West Coast Trust in Portland, Oregon. His $600 million portfolio includes around $20 million in money market funds run by managers, including Federated. Federated has reassured him of the funds’ resilience, he said.  Besides, Trout said, most investors regard the talk in Washington as policy dispute rather than a question about the government’s ability to pay bills.  “The market seems to recognize this as a political event and not related to solvency,” he added.

43,BLK,UPDATE 4-Slim's America Movil takes final consolidation step," * America Movil launches offer to absorb Telmex   * Latest step in consolidating Slim telcos holdings   * Telmex shares jump 7.69 pct, America Movil down 2 pct  (Adds deal value, cash position, CFO comments)   MEXICO CITY, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Billionaire Carlos Slim moved on Monday to bring his whole telecommunications empire under one roof when America Movil launched an offer to buy the rest of fixed-line phone subsidiary Telefonos de Mexico.   America Movil (AMXL.MX) (AMX.N) already owns almost 60 percent of Telmex after a consolidation last year, and is now seeking to take the remaining 40 percent in a deal worth about $6.5 billion based on the current market capitalization of Telmex.   The company said it has ample resources to finance the Telmex deal.   “We had a good cash position and we also have some credit lines,” Chief Financial Officer Carlos Garcia Moreno told Reuters. “We are in a very comfortable position from a liquidity perspective.”   The deal is subject to various regulatory approvals, the company said in a statement, and the closing date is not known.   Telmex TELMEXL.MX shares ended up 7.69 percent at 10.22 pesos on the news that America Movil will pay a premium for the stock, while shares in America Movil — which have been battered this year by a battle with regulators — sank almost 2 percent.   Slim, the world’s richest man, has been hit by competition probes into his phone companies over the rates he charges competitors to use his network. One of the biggest blows came in May, when the government crushed Telmex’s long-coveted bid to offer television services in Mexico.   The move comes just over a year after America Movil acquired Telmex’s international unit and increased its stake in Telmex itself as the mobile phone giant swallowed the underperforming companies. America Movil said it would delist Telmex if the bid was successful.   “I think the primary rationale for doing this is that Telmex as a stock has had very little in the way of equity or institutional interest for a while,” said analyst Christopher King with Stifel Nicolaus.   He said he did not see any operational changes or issues from the deal, although delisting Telmex shares or shutting down investor relations and corporate finance within the company would cut costs. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Slim's battle with regulators link.reuters.com/tag62s  Analysis on pay TV chances:                [ID:nN30237283]  Analysis on Mexico's competition crackdown [ID:nN12110496] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  Shortly after the announcement, big shareholder AT&T (T.N) said it would sell its Telmex shares and said the America Movil offer would value its stake at around $1.37 billion.  According to company data from the end of February, AT&T held 19.4 percent of Telmex’s AA shares.  Thomson Reuters data show BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest money manager, holds a 1.6 percent stake of L shares and Vanguard Group another 1.2 percent of L shares.   America Movil, which had about $7.5 billion in cash and securities at the end of June, said it will pay 10.50 pesos ($0.90) a share for Telmex, a premium of 11.1 percent to its share price over the last 30 days.   Like other fixed-line phone operators, Telmex has been struggling amid competition from Internet-based call providers and mobile phone companies, although its Internet business keeps growing quarter after quarter.   Analyst Valeria Romo from brokerage Monex said the move would be negative for America Movil in the short term but more positive in the future.   “I think it’s negative news for America Movil, which already owned 59 percent of Telmex ... America Movil would absorb the whole loss that Telmex carries,” she said.   “In the long term being the full owner of Telmex will mean it can exploit 4G technology.”   Telmex reported a lower second-quarter profit last month, hurt by lower revenues as call traffic declined. [ID:nN1E76I25O]   Just recently, Telmex’s Chief Financial Officer Adolfo Cerezo announced his retirement from the company after a 33 year-long career with the Slim giant.

44,BLK,UPDATE 1-Gold ETFs get $3.5 bln from investors in July," * Investors added net $13.2 bln to ETFs in July   * Two largest gold ETFs got $3.5 bln   * State Street, Invesco take in top inflows  (Adds comments from State Street, Vanguard)   BOSTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Investors who were nervous about the looming debt ceiling showdown poured $3.5 billion in July into exchange-traded funds that own gold, according to fund tracking website IndexUniverse.com.   The biggest gold ETF, the $65 billion SPDR Gold Trust (GLD.P) managed by State Street (STT.N), added $2.9 billion of net inflow, IndexUniverse said in its monthly report. BlackRock’s $8 billion iShares Gold Trust (IAU.P) took in $632 million.   “What we continued to hear over the last six or eight weeks from investors was a sense of uncertainty and so certain assets like gold become part of the conversation,” said Anthony Rochte, senior managing director at State Street Global Advisors.   It is hard to predict whether investor interest in gold will lessen now that the debt ceiling has been raised, he added.   The move worked out for investors as fears about a possible U.S. debt default and the weakening economy pushed down stock prices and aided gold.   The SPDR Gold ETF gained more than 11 percent since the beginning of July as the stock market tumbled with the Standard & Poor’s 500, down 6 percent over the same period. Over the past year, the gold ETF gained 40 percent compared to an 11 percent gain for the S&P 500.   Only the $85 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY.P), which has by far the largest trading volume of any ETF, took in more than the SPDR Gold fund in July, gaining $3.3 billion in the month.   Overall for July, investors added a net $13.2 billion to exchange-traded funds. All major categories got substantial inflow, including U.S. and international equity, fixed-income and commodities, the website said.   Among fund firms, State Street, the second-largest U.S. ETF manager, took in a net $5.8 billion, the most of any manager. Boston-based State Street surpassed BlackRock (BLK.N), the largest U.S. ETF manager, which took in $1.9 billion.   Invesco’s Powershares unit took in $2.2 billion largely on the strength of its Powershares QQQ (QQQ.O) fund.   Vanguard Group got $1.3 billion during the month.   Vanguard remains in the lead for total inflow year-to-date with almost $22 billion, spokesman John Woerth said. “Vanguard has experienced seven straight months of $1 billion or more of postive net cash flow into our ETFs,” he said.

In court papers filed late Thursday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought to intervene in order to “protect the marketplace and the interests of New York investors, the vast majority of whom otherwise are not present before the Court in this proceeding.”  The filing comes a day before a scheduled court hearing in the case that’s expected to address when parties opposing the deal can seek discovery.

In court documents, Schneiderman echoed complaints from other investors who have said that the deal was done in secret and was rife with conflicts. He called the proposed settlement “both procedurally and substantively flawed.”  Schneiderman argued that Bank of New York was conflicted during the negotiations with Bank of America because Countrywide agreed to indemnify it for claims arising out of its role as trustee.  “As trustee, BNYM owed and owes a fiduciary duty of undivided loyalty to trust investors, and its direct financial interest in the consummation and approval of the settlement violates that duty of strict loyalty,” said Schneiderman in court filings.  A spokesman for Bank of New York said in a statement that the allegations are “outrageous” and “baseless.”  “We are confident that we have fulfilled in all respects our responsibilities as Trustee,” he said. “The AG’s action is misguided and fails to comprehend the role of the Trustee and the benefit the settlement would provide to investors.  Bank of America declined to comment.  The objection is the latest wrinkle in BofA’s push to rid itself of mortgage issues stemming from the collapse of the U.S. housing market.  The bank inherited many of its current problems from Countrywide Financial Corp. BofA bought the largest U.S. subprime mortgage lender in July 2008, months before the global financial crisis peaked.  This year, BofA has agreed to a series of settlements to remove the specter it may have to repurchase billions in soured mortgages.  In January, the bank settled with U.S. government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for $2.8 billion.  In April, it settled with bond insurer Assured Guaranty for $1.6 billion.

In court papers filed late Thursday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought to intervene in order to “protect the marketplace and the interests of New York investors, the vast majority of whom otherwise are not present before the Court in this proceeding.”   In late June, BofA settled an eight-month dispute with outside investors who bought Countrywide Financial Corp mortgage bonds.   The investors — including Pacific Investment Management Co, or PIMCO, and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) — requested the bank repurchase toxic home loans that comprised a series of mortgage-backed securities.

S&P said the downgrades, which also hit big insurers, were due to its lowering of the U.S. sovereign credit rating late on Friday. That decision prompted the agency to review ratings of a host of entities whose financial health depends heavily on the federal government.   S&P based its decision on its view the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama have not done enough to shrink the budget deficit and rising debt burden. A Senate panel responded by launching a probe of the downgrade. See: [ID:nN1E7771XF].   Prices of Treasuries held their gains while the U.S. stock market’s dive accelerated after President Barack Obama said he hopes S&P’s downgrade gives lawmakers a new sense of urgency to tackle long-term deficit spending.   Corporate bond issuance ground to a halt. Even Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), the heavyweight insurer run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, was swept up in the wholesale credit revisions. S&P affirmed its AA-plus rating but cut the company’s outlook to negative.   Four of Berkshire’s peers suffered the same fate: Assured Guaranty (AGO.N), Guardian, Massachusetts Mutual, and Western & Southern [WESTE.UL]. Five U.S. insurance groups were cut by one notch to AA-plus: Knights of Columbus, New York Life, Northwestern Mutual, Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association of America and United Services Automobile Association.   U.S. bank stocks were among the biggest losers though S&P said the country’s downgrade had no immediate or direct impact on its bank ratings.   The U.S. municipal market got little guidance from S&P, which so far has only cut to AA-plus the ratings of some defeased industrial revenue bonds and debt backed by federal leases. Public housing debt is expected to be cut if it has federal guarantees.   The credit agency currently rates 13 states at AAA and is reviewing the impact of the country’s debt consolidation plan on the budgets of states and municipalities, said David Beers, who leads the agency’s sovereign ratings group.   Muni bond yields closed unchanged to three basis points lower, keeping a tight grip on last week’s stunning rally, which clipped yields of some top quality tax-free bonds as much as 40 basis points. [ID:nN1E7770SM]   The ratings of four institutions that clear and process trades and are crucial to the daily workings of the U.S. financial markets were cut to AA-plus from AAA.   The firms, whose behind-the-scenes work is vital, are: the Depository Trust Co, National Securities Clearing Corp, Fixed Income Clearing Corp and the Options Clearing Corp.   Wayne Luthringshausen, chairman of the OCC, said: “This rating change will have no impact on OCC’s operations or our ability to meet our obligations to OCC’s clearing members.”   However, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) warned: “Because of the unprecedented nature of negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the ultimate impacts on global markets and our business, financial condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent.” For details, see: [ID:nN1E77706W].   S&P — the only one of three major rating agencies to cut the U.S. rating from the highest rank — said the downgrade constrains the clearing and depository institutions because “their respective businesses and the assets they hold are concentrated in the domestic market.   “We have not changed our view of the fundamental soundness of their depository or clearing operations,” it said.   Giving the four clearing firms negative outlooks, S&P cited the macro-economy and long-term stability of U.S. markets.   S&P also cut ratings on 73 funds sponsored by banks, states, counties, and cities by as much as two notches because of their direct or indirect investments in Treasuries and U.S. government agency securities.   The list included funds from BlackRock Fund Advisors (BLK.N), Federated Investors (FII.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and State Street (STT.N). Illinois, Georgia, Florida’s Palm Beach County and Los Angeles also made the list.   As expected, S&P cut by one notch to AA-plus the ratings of Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB, the two government-sponsored enterprises that are central to the U.S. residential mortgage market.   Fannie Mae stressed the huge uncertainty S&P injected into global markets. “We cannot predict the ultimate impact of the S&P downgrade on our access to or cost of debt funding, or on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or net worth.” Freddie Mac had no comment.

55,BLK,Canada ETF assets tilt lower with markets in July," * Canada ETF managed assets off 1 pct in July to $39.2 bln   * Canadian ETFs had overall net inflows of C$86 mln   * Investors buying fixed income and dividend yielding ETFs   TORONTO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Canadians put more money into exchange traded funds in July but market weakness led to a 1 percent decline in value of the assets managed in the ETFs, according to a report released on Monday.   ETFs — investment vehicles owning an array of stocks or other assets and traded on public exchanges — had net inflows in Canada of C$86 million in July, BlackRock (BLK.N), the world’s largest money manager, said in a monthly report.   Assets under management in the funds fell 1 percent to C$39.2 billion ($39.6 billion) from June as stock market volatility increased on worries about U.S. and European debt problems.   Assets managed in in Canadian equity ETFs dropped by C$327 million to C$22.62 billion in July, as investors flocked to more defensive asset classes like fixed income, Oliver McMahon, director of product management for iShares Canada, said in an interview.   ETFs that contain dividend-paying stocks were also popular with investors, he said.   “They’re not expecting to shoot the lights out with capital appreciation. They are just looking for a constant, steady trickle of income.”   Fixed income ETFs added C$368 million in assets in the month, to C$9.89 billion.   Commodity-linked ETFs fell by C$106 million to C$1.53 billion, while inverse ETFs, which bet against the market, rose by C$143 million to C$701 million.   Assets in international equity ETFs were up C$7 million to C$4.30 billion, and balanced ETFs gained C$1 million to C$175 million.   Low fees and greater transparency have helped ETFs attract strong investment inflows in recent years. Unlike mutual fund shares, which are re-priced once a day, the price of an ETF is publicly quoted and visible throughout the day.   BlackRock’s Canadian iShares business had a market share of 69 percent in July, down 1.5 percentage points from its June report. Its assets under management were C$27.05 billion, compared with C$28.02 billion month earlier.   Claymore Investments had 16.2 percent market share, up 1.2 percentage points from June. The value of its ETF assets in Canada rose to C$6.37 billion from C$6.27 billion.   Horizon ETF assets held steady at C$2.82 billion, and Bank of Montreal’s (BMO.TO) ETF assets were up to C$2.63 billion from C$2.51 billion.   Invesco PowerShares and XTF Capital, both new entrants to the Canadian ETF marketplace, had C$297 million and C$57 million respectively in assets under management at the end of July.

58,BLK,BlackRock looks to buy more U.S. mortgage agency debt,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is looking for opportunities to buy U.S. mortgage agency debt in the wake of Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign rating, said Rick Rieder, the firm’s chief investment officer of fixed income, fundamental portfolios.  Financial markets in Asia slumped on Monday after S&P’s unprecedented decision to cut the U.S. debt rating on Friday to AA-plus from AAA, a move that could lead to knock-on credit rating cuts of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB.  Rieder, who oversees some $612.5 billion in assets as of June for BlackRock, is focused on the relative quality of so-called GSE debt among other credits.  “GSEs are still a high-quality instrument, and as part of upgrading the liquidity of our portfolio, we have been a buyer of agency mortgages,” Rieder told Reuters over the telephone.  “With increased volatility the agency mortgage market can experience some weakness, and if there is weakness we would add to the portfolio again,” he added.  For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, losing their AAA-rating could lift borrowing costs, potentially making mortgages more expensive for consumers and adding to stress in the already unstable U.S. housing market.  For the past few months since the Federal Reserve’s $600 billion bond-purchase programme wound down, BlackRock has been protecting its credit portfolios against risks coming from the euro zone debt crisis and the impasse over the U.S. debt ceiling by increasing exposure to high-grade bonds.  Rieder said the S&P action was well-flagged so will require little if any changes to his portfolios.  He did not expect the role of U.S. Treasuries has collateral in the repo market to change after the S&P downgrade.  “The Treasury market is a $13 trillion market and a lot of the reason it is used as a form of collateral is not just the AAA rating or what was a AAA rating but the incredible liquidity and because it has become such an accepted form of payment and collateral. A one-notch downgrade by one of three agencies won’t change that dynamic in any significant form.”  Regarding the economic outlook, Rieder believes the U.S. economy will grow below trend for a long time, and the Federal Reserve will not necessarily add more liquidity through a new quantitative easing programme. Rather it may keep the size of its balance sheet for a longer period and extend the duration of some its fixed income assets, he said.  “A recession is unlikely but we can’t rule it out.”  ",8082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-us-debt/blackrock-looks-to-buy-more-u-s-mortgage-agency-debt-idUSTRE7770DM20110808

A one-notch downgrade by one of three agencies won’t change that dynamic in any significant form.”	   Regarding the economic outlook, Rieder believes the U.S. economy will grow below trend for a long time, and the Federal Reserve will not necessarily add more liquidity through a new quantitative easing programme. Rather it may keep the size of its balance sheet for a longer period and extend the duration of some its fixed income assets, he said.	   “A recession is unlikely but we can’t rule it out.”	 	  	  ",8082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-us-debt/update-1-blackrock-looks-to-buy-more-us-mortgage-agency-debt-after-sp-idUSL3E7J809G20110808
60,BLK,BlackRock: Looking for GSE buying opportunity after US downgrade," SINGAPORE, Aug 8 (Reuters) - BlackRock, one of the world’s biggest fund managers, has been increasing the liquidity of its global credit portfolios to prepare for risks that included a U.S. rating downgrade, a top official said on Monday.	   The fund is looking for opportunities to buy U.S. mortgage agency debt, or GSEs, as part of the strategy, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fixed income, fundamental portfolios. 	   “GSEs are still a high quality instrument, and as part of upgrading the liquidity of our portfolio, we have been a buyer of agency mortgages,” Rieder, who oversaw $612.5 billion in assets as of June, told Reuters over the telephone.	   “With increased volatility the agency mortgage market can experience some weakness, and if there is weakness we would add to the portfolio again,” he added.

61,BLK,Shades of post-Lehman crisis in Asian market turmoil,"SEOUL/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian markets on Tuesday endured one of their most volatile days since the height of global financial crisis three years ago as margin calls forced traders to dump risky assets before bargain hunters and state investors swooped in to stem hefty losses.  Sparked by a 6.7 percent fall in the S&P 500 Index .SPX overnight and signs that global growth was sputtering, Asia stocks tanked at the open and quickly spiraled lower on indiscriminate selling.  “I have butterflies in the stomach. It drove me crazy watching the market moves, they were so fickle,” said Shawn Oh, a market strategist at Daishin Securities in Seoul.  South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 slumped close to 10 percent at one stage, its biggest slide in two years, as brokers demanded investors sell stocks or stump up more cash to cover potential losses.  “Retail is very important in Korea, and huge margin calls have been kicking in, so there have been forced sellers for retail,” said an analyst at a foreign brokerage in Seoul who could not be identified due to internal company policy.  Some Asian mutual funds were also seen dumping shares on expectations that investors will pull out what’s left of their money in an effort to preserve capital.  The rout spilled into foreign exchange, commodity and money markets, at one stage thumping the Australian dollar down as much as 3 cents versus the U.S. dollar and pushing it below parity for the first time in five months.  “It’s very illiquid out there. We are still assessing the shock value of the fall in equities on fx and fixed income...,” said the head of a desk at a European bank in Asia, as the selling peaked mid-morning.  “There is a broad sense of systemic risk here. This is completely uncharted territory.”  Japanese foreign exchange margin traders took a bath as stop loss orders hit cross rates include the Aussie/yen and South African rand/yen.  Traders in Reuters’ Dealing Room chatroom kept a stunned silence for the most part, punctuated with the occasional “nutty,” “wow” and “what’s going on?.”  Just as a total meltdown loomed, heavyweight investors, including state funds, stepped in to staunch losses.  Blackrock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s biggest money manager, was one of those looking for bargains in the wreckage.  “Gold and bonds are doing really, really well and we’re making profits on them and putting these into the asset classes that are getting cheaper and cheaper, which are definitely equities,” James Holt, investment strategist at Blackrock in Sydney told Reuters in an interview.  Korea’s state funds also stepped in to support the market, buying 505 billion won ($466 million) worth of shares, though that was dwarfed by selling by foreign investors as the KOSPI closed 3.6 percent lower.  Korea’s bourse operator suspended program trading for five minutes to try to stem losses, while the country’s top financial regulator imposed a three-month ban on stock short selling.  While policymakers from Sydney to Tokyo and Seoul kept up efforts to soothe jittery investors, rumors of emergency measures from the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) at Tuesday’s meeting also played a part in halting the bloodbath, at least temporarily.  “Talk of government funds buying stocks in Korea, Taiwan and Australia seems to have supported the markets. A lot of these indices are deeply oversold,” said Tom Kaan, a Hong Kong-based director at Louis Capital Markets.  “But all eyes are on the FOMC right now for some sort of credible stimulus. If that isn’t forthcoming, then I expect some real money hanging on to longs bailing out.”  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index , already down 11 percent over the past week, fell as much as 5.5 percent during the session before rebounding to close more than 1 percent higher.  “Not even in the global financial crisis did we see this extraordinary volatility,” said RBS Australia’s head of Sydney sales trading, Justin Gallagher.  In China, where the Shanghai Composite .SSEC ended flat after falling as much as 3.5 percent on top of a 3.8 percent fall on Monday, retail investors were rattled.  “I was really scared by the slump .... It’s impossible for any investor not to panic,” said Robin Lu, a 37-year-old who runs a translation business. Lu said he sold one-third of his 100,000 yuan ($15,500) stock portfolio on Monday.  “The tumble has changed my conviction on long-term investment, as the trend has obviously been changed for the worse,” said Lu, who has been investing in stocks since 2006. “The market these days bring back memories of the market meltdown during the 2008 crisis, which taught me the importance of cutting losses decisively.”  Hong Kong stocks .HSI suffered their worst one-day loss, 5.7 percent, since the 2008 crisis. The moves in Hong Kong and South Korea came as stock futures saw record volume.  Not all market participants were fazed by the volatility. In Tokyo, which has endured a succession of natural and financial disasters, traders were more sanguine.  “It’s not panic selling yet. You’re not seeing all investors puking. It’s very orderly selling in a sense,” said a trader for a U.S. brokerage based in Tokyo who did not want to be identified.  Some players even welcomed the wild ride.  “These are great moves for bulls and bears today if you held your nerve and were prudent on the size of your positions,” said Geoff Last, a market veteran of more than 30 years and head of Institutional FX at AXI Trader, an Australian forex broking firm. “It was amazing, crazy stuff ... one remarkable day.”  But with European markets giving up early gains and major indexes there falling as much as 6 percent, traders and investors were reluctant to call an end to the mayhem.  “We are getting a feeling that we are not out of the woods yet,” said a head of sales at a Honk Kong -based hedge fund.  “We are advising our clients to stay out as much as possible and take profits on any rallies. This is not normal market behavior.” ($1 = 1082.650 Korean Won) ($1 = 6.436 Chinese Yuan)  ",8092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-market-turmoil/shades-of-post-lehman-crisis-in-asian-market-turmoil-idUSTRE7781R820110809
62,BLK,"BlackRock to use gold, bond profits to buy beaten down stocks","SYDNEY (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N) will use profits it is making in gold and bond markets to seek out bargains in falling global equity markets, James Holt, investment strategist at the world’s largest money manager, said on Tuesday.  “Gold and bonds are doing really, really well and we’re making profits on them and putting these into the asset classes that are getting cheaper and cheaper, which are definitely equities,” Sydney-based Holt said in an interview.  Gold equities and gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) account for about 5 percent of BlackRock’s $83 billion global allocation fund, according to Holt, and BlackRock overall manages an estimated $3.7 trillion in assets.  U.S. gold futures for December struck a record around $1,746 an ounce on Tuesday, while cash gold hit an all-time high about $1,742 an ounce, its 12th record in 20 sessions.  Investors worldwide have been dumping any growth-related assets on fears the twin U.S. and European debt crises would tip the world economy into another recession, pushing up safe havens such as government debt and gold that provide insurance against depreciating investments.  “Our global allocation fund still likes equities on the whole, but we tend to have had those equities that are either exposed to Chinese growth, which is more sustainable, or the big multi-national dividend payers, the ones that have the lowest PEs (price-earnings) and highest dividends, and pretty strong cash flows,” Holt said.  He singled out telecommunications, healthcare and energy sectors as preferred sectors for the fund.  Energy stocks, he said, were offering substantial dividends, possess a lower beta, or measure of risk, to the oil price and act as a proxy on the Chinese consumer.  “We have been underweight U.S. Treasuries and have virtually no Japanese government bonds,” Holt said.  The Japanese bonds were “fundamentally, very expensive,” he said.  “A big thing for our global allocation fund will be as the market goes lower, we will be nibbling into the market each day. Our bonds and gold holdings will be doing well, but when we are rebalancing, we will be rebalancing into equities,” Holt said.  Wall Street ended its last session down more than 6 percent while European stocks hit a two-year low.  “As equities get cheaper and cheaper, the question is: As the fire is around you, do you want to take out more insurance, or do you want to start preparing for after the fire?,” said Holt.  “I think that is the type of territory we are moving toward,” he said.  Holt said that even before the decision on Friday by U.S. rating agency Standard & Poor’s to lower its long-term credit rating on U.S. government bonds by one notch to AA-plus from its highest AAA level, stocks were already “looking pretty cheap.”  “We’ve been carrying a lot of cash through this crisis as well, depending on the period between 7 percent and 12 percent and we also have about a 5 percent allocation to gold,” hold said, adding investments in gold were roughly divided 50-50 between gold equities and ETFs.  “The thing about gold is that it always comes along at the right point to balance out risks in the fund,” Holt said  ",8092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock/blackrock-to-use-gold-bond-profits-to-buy-beaten-down-stocks-idUSTRE7780KH20110809

64,BLK,BofA talks to Gulf funds to cut $17 billion CCB stake: sources,"HONG KONG/DUBAI (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) has held exploratory talks with the principal investment funds of Kuwait and Qatar about selling part of its $17 billion stake in China Construction Bank (0939.HK), three sources with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters.  Bank of America, which owns about 10 percent of CCB’s (601939.SS) Hong Kong-listed shares and is scurrying to raise capital for its mortgage-scarred balance sheet, will be contractually free to sell the bank shares after August 29.  BofA, the largest U.S. bank by assets, is likely to sell half its stake to shore up its Tier 1 capital, one of the sources said. Analysts believe Bank of America needs about $50 billion to meet new capital requirements.  Talks about the Chinese bank have been held with other investors in addition to the Kuwait Investment Authority and the Qatar Investment Authority, the sources said.  If successful, the move to sell the shares to the sovereign wealth funds will alleviate concerns that BofA will be selling the stake in the open market through a block deal.  Shares of CCB rose as much as 4 percent, bucking a fall in the benchmark Hong Kong share index .HSI, as traders cut short positions and bet the huge overhang would now not have to be absorbed on the market.  “The market must be thinking that BofA is going to unload their entire stake to Middle Eastern SWFs without showing anything to the street,” one Hong Kong-based trader said.  Shares of the Chinese bank have fallen some 20 percent, partly in anticipation of a BofA sale, traders said.  The stock was up 1.3 percent at the mid-session break compared with a 1.5 percent fall in the benchmark index.  It was unclear if any agreement with the sovereign wealth funds or other investors have been cemented. Sources said no talks are being held currently.  Bank of America, whose shares have fallen 27 percent in the past week, did not mention the China investment during a widely followed conference call that top executives held on Wednesday with thousands of investors. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson said on the call that asset sales are being considered to boost capital.  “These stakes will be sold eventually,” a second source said of the Chinese bank shares. “They have been shown previously to funds who matter.”  Bank of America spokesman Jerry Dubrowski declined to discuss whether negotiations have been held, and officials at QIA and KIA were not immediately available for comment.  “We continue to be a significant shareholder in CCB and we intend to continue the important long-term strategic alliance with CCB originally entered into in 2005,” Dubrowski said.  The sources sought anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.  Bank of America has not been getting much support this year from its CCB investment.  Last November, Bank of America sold its option to purchase additional shares of CCB that were available in a rights offering.  Chinese banks have been pressured by slowing loan growth and mounting worries about bad debts. Last month, Temasek Holdings TEM.UL, a state-owned investment vehicle in Singapore that bought the CCB rights from BofA, sold $3.6 billion worth of stakes in two large China banks.  Over the past year, BofA has shed its stakes in banks in South America and Latin America, as well as a portion of its holdings in New York-based BlackRock Inc, (BLK.N) the world’s largest asset manager.  Last week, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank sold 400,000 residential mortgage loans with an unpaid principal balance of $73 billion to Fannie Mae, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the deal.  Middle Eastern sovereign funds are familiar with Chinese financial firms. QIA and KIA were cornerstone investors in Agricultural Bank of China Ltd’s (1288.HK) IPO last year. KIA also invested $1 billion in insurer AIA Group’s (1299.HK) Hong Kong listing.  BofA paid $3 billion for a 9.9 percent stake in CCB, the world’s No. 2 bank by market value, before the Chinese lender’s IPO in 2005. The U.S. bank then exercised an option to buy an extra 11 percent for $9.2 billion. BofA sold part of its stake in May 2009.  The U.S. bank is now left with 25.6 million shares, including 23.6 million that come out of a lock-up on Aug 29. It is free to sell the remaining shares in 2013.  The U.S. bank is eager to retain about half of the stake as a bet on growth in China, one source said.  China’s top three banks went public in the middle of last decade, and each attracted large investments from U.S. and European banks before their offerings. The investments were marketed as a strong selling point by underwriters, but several of the overseas strategic investors have partly or fully exited their stakes following the expiration of lock-up periods.

66,BLK,"Obama, CEOs talk markets, global economy woes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global financial upheaval was on the agenda on Friday when President Barack Obama met with top executives from the U.S. business community, the White House said.  Chief executives from Johnson & Johnson, Wells Fargo & Co, U.S. Bank, Xerox Corp, BlackRock Inc, Silver Lake Partners, American Express and U.S. Steel all met with Obama to discuss the economy and the president’s plans to create jobs.  Obama held his latest in a series of talks with Big Business against the backdrop of a euro zone debt crisis that has hit financial markets worldwide, adding to investor anxiety in the aftermath of last week’s U.S. credit downgrade.  Before Friday’s session which included major players from the financial sector, the White House said market turmoil and economic troubles around the world would be among the issues discussed, along with the U.S. economy and job creation.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest denied the meeting was called in reaction to market and global concerns but said: “They’ll certainly talk about these issues, about the market reaction here.”  The meeting came at the end of a volatile week. U.S. stocks rose on Friday as mildly upbeat retail sales data offset a closely watched barometer showing U.S. consumer sentiment at its lowest point in more than three decades.  European stock markets also gained despite continued concern about French banks’ exposure to European debt woes.  Critics have complained that Obama has failed to reassure Americans as markets whipsawed this week, in one of the most dramatic periods in the stock market since he took office amid the financial crisis in January 2009.  He said on Thursday that Europe’s debt troubles were among the global challenges weighing on the struggling U.S. recovery, but the White House said the administration remained confident in European leaders’ ability to handle the situation.  Obama’s hopes for re-election in 2012 will likely hinge on his success in lowering unemployment, currently pinned above 9 percent, boosting sluggish growth and restoring confidence lost from the Standard & Poor’s downgrade and fractious debt talks.  White House meetings with executives have become almost routine as Obama has courted business leaders while seeking to cast himself as more of a centrist.

73,BLK,"China grants QFII status to BlackRock, Amundi"," SHANGHAI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - BlackRock , the world’s largest money manager, and Amundi, the asset management venture between Credit Agricole and Societe Generale  , have been given the go-ahead by China’s securities regulator to invest in China’s capital markets through their subsidiaries.	   BlackRock Institutional Trust Company and Amundi Hong Kong Ltd have been granted Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) licences, bringing the total number of QFII investors to 115, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement on its website.	   (For the list of QFII investors, click: )	   Global names such as Aberdeen Asset Management and Templeton Asset Management have already joined the QFII scheme, which was launched in 2003 as part of China’s drive to gradually open its strictly-regulated capital markets.    	   BlackRock and Amundi still need to obtain investment quotas from China’s foreign currency regulator before they can start buying Chinese stocks and bonds.	   By the end of April, 103 licenced QFII investors had been granted a combined quota of $20.7 billion to invest in China’s capital markets, a magnet to many foreign investors due to the country’s rapid economic growth and appreciating currency.

74,BLK,ETF leader BlackRock files to run its own indexes,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the largest manager of exchange-traded funds, has filed to create its own market indexes for its iShares funds, a move that could significantly reduce the firm’s costs.  According to an August 25 securities filing, BlackRock wants exemptions from portions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 so it can provide indexes for its own funds, as the Securities and Exchange Commission has granted to some other managers.  The move would be similar that of some smaller ETF managers like Russell Investments, WisdomTree Investments and Claymore Investments, BlackRock said in its filing.  BlackRock, which has $632 billion of ETF assets under management, currently tracks indexes provided by other companies in return for licensing fees. McGraw-Hill Cos Inc’s Standard & Poor’s and News Corp’s Dow Jones are among the top iShare index providers.  BlackRock doesn’t disclose how much it pays in licensing fees for its ETFs. But officials at competing ETF providers said that licensing fees can account for anywhere from 10 to 33 percent of an ETF’s expense ratio.  In its annual report for its SPDR S&P 500 ETF, State Street Global Advisors Inc disclosed that it pays 0.3 percent in licensing fees to Standard & Poor’s, while the total expense ratio for the ETF is 0.9 percent.  “If iShares is paying something similar, that’s real money,” said Tim Strauts, an ETF analyst at Morningstar Inc.  Christine Hudacko, an iShares spokeswoman, declined to comment.  Having its own indexes would not only allow BlackRock to introduce new products at a lower cost, but it would enable the firm to launch index-based products not available from current index providers.  “They can always go to an index provider with an idea and see if they are interested in doing it, but if they can do it themselves they won’t have to worry about that process,” Strauts said.  It is unclear if BlackRock would replace its current indexes with its own if it gets this approval.  “Institutional clients like those benchmarks,” Strauts said. “If BlackRock does start replacing indices, I think they would start with the smaller funds.”  Given the potential savings, it’s only a matter of time before other major ETF providers such as The Vanguard Group and State Street Global Advisors Inc make similar moves, said William Thomas, former president of Grail Advisors LLC, an active ETF provider that was bought by Columbia Management Investment Advisers LLC earlier this year.  Joel Dickson, senior investment strategist in ETF research at Vanguard, said the firm has considered introducing their own indexes, but the firm has no current plans.

76,BLK,BofA $8.5 billion settlement may go to federal court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors objecting to Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) $8.5 billion settlement of claims over losses on mortgage-backed securities are seeking to send their dispute to federal court, potentially delaying a resolution of one of the beleaguered bank’s largest legal liabilities.  According to a Friday court filing, 11 entities sharing the name Walnut Place want to move the case to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan from the state supreme court in that borough.  They said the case qualifies as a “mass action” because of its size and complexity, making federal court jurisdiction appropriate. The matter has been in state court since June 29.  The settlement was intended to resolve much of Bank of America’s remaining legal liability tied to its disastrous 2008 purchase of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), the trustee handling 530 Countrywide mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances, negotiated the settlement with 22 institutional investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Allianz SE’s (ALVG.DE) Pimco.  Investors unhappy with the payout or disclosures had until August 30 to intervene in the case, ahead of a November 17 court hearing. Friday’s filing may upset that timetable.  Bank of New York Mellon will seek to move the case back to state court and believes Walnut Place’s effort “is unsupported by the law and will only serve to delay the resolution of the proceeding,” bank spokesman Kevin Heine said.  Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson called the Walnut Place filing “tactical maneuvering.”  David Grais and Owen Cyrulnik, lawyers for Walnut Place, did not respond to emailed requests for comment.  Worries about how much Bank of America will ultimately have to pay angry mortgage securities investors, including in a $10 billion lawsuit by the insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N), had driven down the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank’s share price to a nearly two and a half year low.  On Thursday, however, the bank won a vote of confidence in the form of a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N).  Other investors challenging the $8.5 billion settlement include pension funds and insurers, and six Federal Home Loan Banks, which offer financing for mortgage and business loans.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on August 4 announced his own opposition, suggesting the payout is too low and that Bank of New York Mellon is conflicted and could receive financial benefits from the accord.  A Schneiderman spokeswoman on Friday declined to comment.  The federal case is assigned to U.S. District Judge William Pauley. He is also handling an investor lawsuit that accuses Bank of America of “dollar rolling” — concealing risk by transferring mortgage debt to another entity and buying it back after issuing quarterly statements.

In its filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the FDIC said it is “the receiver of numerous banks and owner of many certificates” issued by many of the 530 mortgage pools of the former Countrywide Financial Corp that the settlement covers.  The FDIC, whose full name is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, said it is intervening because it does not have enough information to evaluate the settlement.  Other investors that objected on Monday included a variety of banks, insurers and investment funds. Among them are Jeffrey Gundlach’s money management firm Doubleline Capital LP, and the banking unit of Wayne, New Jersey’s Valley National Bancorp.

The June 29 accord was intended to resolve much of Bank of America’s remaining legal liability tied to its 2008 purchase of Countrywide, once the nation’s largest mortgage lender.  But dozens of investors who did not negotiate but would be bound by the accord have said the payout is too low, or that they lack enough information to know whether it is fair.

A New York state judge is scheduled to consider whether to approve the settlement on November 17, but some investors want the case handled in federal court.

81,BLK,Fannie/Freddie regulator challenges BofA MBS pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as dozens of investors, on Tuesday lodged objections to Bank of America Corp’s proposed $8.5 billion mortgage-backed securities settlement.  Separately, a group of homeowners sued to block the accord, saying it would speed up foreclosures and prolong abuses in how mortgage loans are serviced. They are seeking a court order to force Bank of America to adopt and follow servicing policies that are “higher than current industry standards.”  The settlement covers 530 mortgage pools from the former Countrywide Financial Corp, which was the nation’s largest mortgage lender before Bank of America bought it in 2008.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the trustee handling the 530 trusts with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances, had negotiated the settlement with 22 institutional investors including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco.  But some other investors say the payout is too low, or they lack enough information to know whether the accord is fair.  Lawrence Grayson, a bank spokesman, declined to comment, as did Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine.  In a court filing, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, called it a “positive” that the settlement calls for improving loan servicing and fixing deficient documentation, and said the support of many large market participants is “encouraging.”  Still, the FHFA said it lacks enough information about the accord, and wants to be ready to voice a “substantive” objection “should a now unforeseen issue arise” that hurts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  “The FHFA sounds like it wants to preserve its right to contest refinements that could expose Fannie and Freddie to greater losses,” said Kathleen Engel, associate dean at Suffolk University Law School in Boston and co-author of “The Subprime Virus.”  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010 guaranteed 70 percent of single-family mortgage-backed securities that were issued, and provided $1.03 trillion of market liquidity, an FHFA report to Congress in June shows.  Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for the FHFA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Meanwhile, the homeowners, who say they have received default notices, seek class-action status for Countrywide borrowers from 2004 to 2008 whose loans are in the trusts and are serviced by Bank of America.”  “The settlement agreement will speed up foreclosures, perpetuate existing servicing abuses in the system, and undermine federal programs designed to stabilize the housing market,” the complaint said.  Bank of America is among large U.S. banks negotiating with regulators nationwide on a potential multi-billion dollar settlement to improve foreclosure practices.  “It is not clear the borrowers have standing,” Engel said. “They certainly may be aggrieved by servicing problems, but they have to show the settlement itself causes them harm, either new injury or the loss of legal rights.”  A lawyer for the homeowners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Several dozen objections to the $8.5 billion settlement were filed ahead of a Tuesday deadline to intervene in the case, which is overseen by New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan.  Some of the challenges were filed simultaneously in federal court, where some of the objectors hope to move the case.  American International Group Inc, the insurer suing Bank of America for $10 billion in a separate MBS case, and the National Credit Union Administration were among those to object on Tuesday to the accord.  Others that have objected include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, attorneys general of New York and Delaware, and various banks, insurers, investment funds and pension funds.  Bank of America paid $2.5 billion to buy Countrywide, but writedowns and legal costs have pushed the estimated cost of that purchase to more than $30 billion.

83,BLK,"Nevada, U.S. regulator challenge BofA on mortgages","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s mortgage practices came under fresh fire as state and federal regulators questioned whether the largest U.S. bank is doing what it must to address perceived harm to homeowners and investors.  Nevada’s attorney general on Tuesday accused the bank of repeatedly violating its $8.4 billion agreement with that state and others to address fraudulent lending charges involving its Countrywide unit, which it bought in 2008.  Catherine Cortez Masto, the state attorney general, asked a federal judge in Reno, Nevada, to let her back out of that accord and sue Bank of America on behalf of homeowners in Nevada, which has one of the nation’s highest foreclosure rates and percentages of borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth.  Separately on Tuesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as dozens of investors lodged objections to Bank of America’s proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in Countrywide mortgage-backed securities, an agreement negotiated by the trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  Among the other objectors was Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which said it lacks enough information to know whether the accord treats all “similarly situated” investors equally.  And in a third proceeding, a group of homeowners sued to block that $8.5 billion accord, saying it would speed up foreclosures and prolong mortgage abuses. That group asked for a court order requiring the bank to follow servicing policies that are “higher than current industry standards.”  In her proposed complaint, the Nevada attorney general said Bank of America still engages in “a pattern and practice” of misleading consumers about such matters as why it denies mortgage modifications, or begins foreclosures while modification requests are pending.  Bank of America was to help 400,000 borrowers modify their home loans under the 2008 accord.  But Masto called the process “chaotic,” even accusing the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank of reprimanding workers for spending “too much time” on the phone — an average of seven to 10 minutes — with individual customers.  “Defendants’ deceptive practices have resulted in an explosion of delinquencies and unauthorized and unnecessary foreclosures” in Nevada, Masto said in court papers. “The state no longer can get the benefit of its original settlement.”  It is unclear how the allegations might affect long-running negotiations on a potential multibillion-dollar settlement with regulators nationwide to improve foreclosure practices at several big banks, including Bank of America.  “We disagree that there has been any material breach of the consent decree and will continue to vigorously defend this action.” Bank of America spokeswoman Jumana Bauwens said in response to the Nevada filings.  Lawrence Grayson, another bank spokesman, declined to comment on the other litigation matters, as did Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine.  The settlement with mortgage-backed securities covers 530 mortgage pools from the former Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest U.S. mortgage lender before Bank of America bought it.  Bank of New York Mellon had negotiated the accord, covering $174 billion of unpaid principal balances, with 22 big investors including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco.  But some other investors say the payout is too low, or they lack enough information to know whether the accord is fair.  In a court filing, the FHFA called it a “positive” that the settlement calls for improving loan servicing and fixing deficient documentation, and said the support of many large market participants is “encouraging.”  Still, the FHFA said it lacks enough information about the accord, and wants to be ready to voice a “substantive” objection “should a now unforeseen issue arise.”  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010 guaranteed 70 percent of single-family mortgage-backed securities that were issued, and provided $1.03 trillion of market liquidity, an FHFA report to Congress in June shows.  “The FHFA sounds like it wants to preserve its right to contest refinements that could expose Fannie and Freddie to greater losses,” said Kathleen Engel, associate dean at Suffolk University Law School in Boston and co-author of “The Subprime Virus.”  Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for the FHFA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Meanwhile, the homeowners, who say they have received default notices, seek class-action status for Countrywide borrowers from 2004 to 2008 whose loans are in the trusts and are serviced by Bank of America.”  “The settlement agreement will speed up foreclosures, perpetuate existing servicing abuses in the system, and undermine federal programs designed to stabilize the housing market,” the complaint said.  “It is not clear the borrowers have standing,” Engel said. “They certainly may be aggrieved by servicing problems, but they have to show the settlement itself causes them harm, either new injury or the loss of legal rights.”  A lawyer for the homeowners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bank of America paid $2.5 billion to buy Countrywide, but writedowns and legal costs have pushed the estimated cost of that purchase to more than $30 billion.  Several dozen objections to the $8.5 billion settlement were filed ahead of a Tuesday deadline to intervene in the case, which is overseen by New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan.  Some of the challenges were filed simultaneously in federal court, where some of the objectors hope to move the case.  American International Group Inc, the insurer suing Bank of America for $10 billion in a separate MBS case, is among the objectors. Others include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, attorneys general of New York and Delaware, and various banks, insurers, investment funds and pension funds.  US Bancorp, trustee for a $1.75 billion Countrywide mortgage pool, this week separately sued Bank of America to force it to buy back the underlying loans.  The Nevada case is Nevada v.

85,BLK,U.S. judge pans rush in BofA $8.5 billion mortgage pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A judge questioned why Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion settlement with mortgage securities investors was being rushed for approval and whether the trustee that negotiated it treated investors fairly.  U.S. District Judge William Pauley set a September 21 hearing to consider requests from some investors to move the case to Manhattan federal court from a New York state court, where the trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp wants it handled.  That timetable is slower than Bank of New York Mellon wanted and could imperil a scheduled November 17 hearing before New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick to consider approving the settlement.  “It strikes me there are some novel and complex issues,” Pauley said at a hearing on Thursday. “The court would benefit from some fulsome briefing.”  A delay could help unhappy investors learn more through additional litigation, which could lead to higher payouts.  “There’s nothing special about the dates,” said Owen Cyrulnik, a lawyer for 11 investment entities sharing the Walnut Place name that have challenged the accord. “None of these dates are set in stone.”  The settlement covers 530 mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances from Countrywide Financial Corp, which was the largest U.S. mortgage lender before Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America bought it in 2008.  Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment. Bank of America were down 14 cents at $8.03 in afternoon trading.  The settlement was negotiated by the trustee with 22 institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco and also requires Bank of America to improve its mortgage servicing practices.  But 44 groups of investors, including banks, hedge funds, insurers and pension funds, complained they do not have enough information to know whether the accord is fair. Some say the 5 cents on the dollar payout is too low. Others suggested Bank of New York Mellon has conflicts of interest.  Among those investors seeking to intervene were Walnut Place, American International Group Inc, the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  At Thursday’s hearing, Pauley asked Matthew Ingber, a lawyer for Bank of New York Mellon, why the bank seemed to push for a quick settlement and failed to notify all of the trust beneficiaries.  “What is the extreme exigency here?” Pauley said. “You did unilaterally just fix those dates, and the state court judge went along with it ... in a vacuum.”  Ingber said quick approval would assure the return of money to investors and improve Bank of America’s mortgage servicing.  NO OPT-OUT  But Pauley questioned Bank of New York Mellon’s decision to seek approval of the accord through a so-called Article 77 proceeding, which under New York law lets a trustee seek a judicial endorsement of trust-related decisions.  It is usually invoked in smaller disputes rather than large commercial cases and the judge said its “main benefit appears to limit the right of the trust beneficiaries to opt out.”  That makes a resolution to an Article 77 case unlike a typical class-action settlement, which the Bank of America accord resembles in other respects.  Ingber said Bank of New York Mellon in fact was “open and transparent,” adding: “I disagree with the premise that we’re not giving others opportunities to be heard.”  Pauley also challenged the bank’s reliance on opinions from professors and mortgage specialists to help it settle the $8.5 billion payout.  “How can any expert opine on the amount a certificate holder could recover through litigation?” he said.  Prior to setting the September 21 hearing date, Pauley gave Walnut Place until September 14 to file papers. He then chided Ingber’s request for a week to respond.  “Now it’s not so expedited,” the judge said.  He gave two days.

88,BLK,UPDATE 1-BlackRock seeks less disclosure on new ETFs," * 13 new active ETFs proposed under new Spruce trust   * Funds would disclose holdings quarterly, not daily   * Same teams that run iShares likely to run new ETFs  (Adds Blackrock comment, attorney comment, background)   BOSTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Money management giant BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) asked regulators for permission to set up a new unit offering actively managed exchange-traded funds that would not disclose their holdings on a daily basis.   In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late on Thursday, BlackRock said the new unit, Spruce ETF Trust, would manage 13 equity funds and reveal their holdings only on a quarterly basis, like ordinary mutual funds.   The new funds, which might not be approved for several years, would likely be run by the same managers that oversee New York-based BlackRock’s iShares division, the world’s largest ETF manager with $632 billion of assets.   “Should these funds be approved, it is the intention of BlackRock that they would be operated by the same teams that support the firm’s existing ETFs,” a spokeswoman said. “The filing process can take years.”   BlackRock’s latest move to differentiate its ETF offerings follows the firm’s filing last week asking permission to have its funds track indexes it would create in-house instead of using outside providers.   Competition is growing in the $1 trillion U.S. ETF market and copycat index funds abound. Some managers, including BlackRock, Pimco and AdvisorShares, are trying to stand out with actively managed funds. But the sector has attracted less than $10 billion so far.   Previously approved active ETFs disclose their complete holdings every day just like index-tracking ETFs. That makes it easy for ETF market participants to create and redeem shares and keep a fund’s trading price close to its net asset value.   BlackRock said it would set up a blind trust to create and redeem shares for the 13 new ETFs. Market participants wanting new shares from one of the funds would give the blind trust cash instead of shares of stock.   Regulators are likely to move slowly on the issue, John McGuire, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in Washington, D.C. and a former SEC attorney, said. The agency took five years to approve the first leveraged and inverse ETFs, he noted.   Approval of the application, however, would attract many more firms, McGuire said. “The biggest drawback with actively managed ETFs for most asset managers is that they have some proprietary strategy that they don’t want to be disclosing on a daily basis,” he said.

90,BLK,ETF growth to drive Asia program trading - C.Suisse," HONG KONG, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The growing use of exchange traded funds as a way to gain access to Asian markets, and heavier activity around index rebalancing is driving growth in program trading in the region according to a report published by Credit Suisse Group AG .	   The steady rise in assets being allocated to emerging markets, particularly by passive investors through index tracking funds and ETFs, has led to an uptick in program trading activity in Asia, even while overall volumes on stock exchanges have largely remained sluggish.	   Program trading refers to the buying and selling of a basket of shares as a single security, allowing fund managers a more efficient means of getting in or out of several stocks.	   ETFs, which track benchmark indexes often offer cheaper and less complicated access to many of Asia’s stock markets than derivatives and have seen a sharp uptick in interest.	   According to BlackRock Inc , owner of iShares and the world’s largest asset manager, assets under management in Asia ex-Japan ETFs grew to $61.2 billion by the end June, up 15 percent since the start of the year, compared with a 10 percent rise globally.	   “Money coming into the access markets in the region such as India, Korea and Taiwan is doing so via ETFs and access products, which has presented pretty good growth opportunities for program trading,” said Khaleel Mohideen, a managing director at Credit Suisse who oversees program trading operations.	   A quarter of Credit Suisse’s total client flow in Asia was via program trading, the bank said in the report.	   According to a Greenwich Associates survey published earlier this year, CLSA shared top ranking with Credit Suisse in terms of market share in 2010 among brokers trading Asian equities with institutions in the region. 	   ETFs RISING	   With ETFs still comprising less than 2 percent of the region’s daily market activity compared with almost 40 percent in the United States, however, there is room to grow. 	   A key aspect of ETFs is that their liquidity depends on the constituent stocks rather than the volumes of the ETF itself. As long as the stocks comprising the ETF are actively traded, banks are able to deliver the baskets to funds.	   “Even if on-exchange liquidity might not be great there is considerable activity around creation and redemption of ETFs and that’s driving a lot of this volume coming through program trading desks.” said Mohideen.	   Another driver for the growth in trading baskets is portfolio positioning.	   Investment managers have struggled this year as a lack of a sustainable trend has hurt performance, and the relatively bullish start to equity markets this year came undone as a debt crisis in Europe worsened, U.S. growth floundered and inflation in Asia hit appetite for stocks. 	   The latest shuffle in strategy came as heightened volatility last month saw institutions accelerate their switch out of sectors most geared to the economy and into safer sectors such as utilities.	   “We didn’t see clients panicking or facing redemptions like in 2008. What happened was that a lot of our clients were transitioning into more defensive plays. So there was a lot of rotational switching and rebalancing of stock portfolios through baskets that we saw coming through,” said Mohideen.	   The chronic challenge of finding liquidity in Asia remains and underscores the uphill task faced by banks looking to expand regional cash equities businesses and are yet to offer advanced execution services or establish a presence in all markets.	   “The key is liquidity and that’s one of the biggest challenges. In the U.S., you have one big market. In Asia, you’ve got more than 11 markets with complex market-structure and nuances,” said Mohideen.

92,BLK,UPDATE 1-Blackrock hires Taborsky from Pimco," * New drive by BlackRock for institutional assets   * Taborsky had followed El-Erian from Harvard to Pimco   BOSTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc(BLK.N) said on Tuesday it hired Pacific Investment Management Co executive Mark Taborsky as part of a drive to bulk up services for institutional clients like pension funds and endowments.   At BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Taborsky will be managing director and senior portfolio manager, charged with developing and running investment products within its U.S. Fiduciary Management Solutions business. The unit is part of BlackRock’s Multi-Asset Client Solutions group, which managed $126 billion as of June 30.   Taborsky joined Pimco in 2008 where he had developed new asset allocation products. Before that he had overseen external managers for Harvard Management Co, which runs Harvard University’s endowment. In moving to Pimco, Taborsky was following the endowment’s former head, Mohamed El-Erian, now Pimco chief executive.   A Pimco spokesman said Taborsky’s duties were taken over by its asset allocation team. Though based in Newport Beach, Calif., Pimco is a unit of German insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE). Earlier on Tuesday Allianz said it has separated Pimco from its other asset management businesses.   A BlackRock spokesman said Taborsky will be based in BlackRock’s Boston office but will spend much time in New York.   He will report to Nancy Everett, head of the U.S. Fiduciary Management business, herself hired in January to the newly created position.

93,BLK,REFILE-ETF growth to drive Asia program trading - C.Suisse," (Fixes dateline on story transmitted Monday, and clarifies definition of program trading in para 3)	   By Vikram Subhedar	   HONG KONG, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The growing use of exchange traded funds as a way to gain access to Asian markets, and heavier activity around index rebalancing is driving growth in program trading in the region, according to a report published by Credit Suisse Group AG .	   The steady rise in assets being allocated to emerging markets, particularly by passive investors through index tracking funds and ETFs, has led to an uptick in program trading activity in Asia, even while overall volumes on stock exchanges have largely remained sluggish.	   Program trading refers to the buying and selling of a basket of shares executed simultaneously and often electronically and offers institutional investors a more efficient means of getting in or out of several stocks.	   ETFs, which track benchmark indexes often offer cheaper and less complicated access to many of Asia’s stock markets than derivatives and have seen a sharp uptick in interest.	   According to BlackRock Inc , owner of iShares and the world’s largest asset manager, assets under management in Asia ex-Japan ETFs grew to $61.2 billion by the end June, up 15 percent since the start of the year, compared with a 10 percent rise globally.	   “Money coming into the access markets in the region such as India, Korea and Taiwan is doing so via ETFs and access products, which has presented pretty good growth opportunities for program trading,” said Khaleel Mohideen, a managing director at Credit Suisse who oversees program trading operations.	   A quarter of Credit Suisse’s total client flow in Asia was via program trading, the bank said in the report.	   According to a Greenwich Associates survey published earlier this year, CLSA shared top ranking with Credit Suisse in terms of market share in 2010 among brokers trading Asian equities with institutions in the region. 	   ETFs RISING	   With ETFs still comprising less than 2 percent of the region’s daily market activity compared with almost 40 percent in the United States, however, there is room to grow. 	   A key aspect of ETFs is that their liquidity depends on the constituent stocks rather than the volumes of the ETF itself. As long as the stocks comprising the ETF are actively traded, banks are able to deliver the baskets to funds.	   “Even if on-exchange liquidity might not be great there is considerable activity around creation and redemption of ETFs and that’s driving a lot of this volume coming through program trading desks.” said Mohideen.	   Another driver for the growth in trading baskets is portfolio positioning.	   Investment managers have struggled this year as a lack of a sustainable trend has hurt performance, and the relatively bullish start to equity markets this year came undone as a debt crisis in Europe worsened, U.S. growth floundered and inflation in Asia hit appetite for stocks. 	   The latest shuffle in strategy came as heightened volatility last month saw institutions accelerate their switch out of sectors most geared to the economy and into safer sectors such as utilities.	   “We didn’t see clients panicking or facing redemptions like in 2008. What happened was that a lot of our clients were transitioning into more defensive plays. So there was a lot of rotational switching and rebalancing of stock portfolios through baskets that we saw coming through,” said Mohideen.	   The chronic challenge of finding liquidity in Asia remains and underscores the uphill task faced by banks looking to expand regional cash equities businesses and are yet to offer advanced execution services or establish a presence in all markets.	   “The key is liquidity and that’s one of the biggest challenges. In the U.S., you have one big market. In Asia, you’ve got more than 11 markets with complex market-structure and nuances,” said Mohideen.

94,BLK,BlackRock names Wiedman to head iShares ETF unit," BOSTON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, named Mark Wiedman to head its $632 billion iShares exchange-traded fund unit.   Wiedman, who had been managing director for corporate strategy at BlackRock, succeeds Michael Latham, who was named chairman of iShares, spokeswoman Bobbie Collins said on Wednesday. Latham will also co-lead BlackRock’s San Francisco office, she said.   Wiedman, who joined BlackRock in 2004 from Morgan Stanley, takes over as iShares maintains its leading position in the $1 trillion U.S. ETF market but faces increasing competition for new business.   New York-based BlackRock collected a net $14.8 billion this year through the end of July in the United States, trailing the $25.0 billion collected by Vanguard Group, according to Morningstar. State Street Corp (STT.N), Invesco Ltd’s (IVZ.N) Powershares, Van Eck Global and ProShares have each taken in more than $5 billion.   Latham, who was tapped to run the worldwide iShares business in July 2010, asked for the change. “Mike was looking for a balance of less travel and more family time,” Collins said.

97,BLK,Insight: Extreme makeover BofA: An asbestos solution,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - It worked for asbestos so why not for toxic mortgages?  When some look at all of the litigation arising from Bank of America’s big role in the U.S. mortgage mess, they start thinking of asbestos and how thousands of lawsuits arising from that cancer-causing product brought down many manufacturers more than a decade ago.  The solution back then to dealing with claims filed by more than 750,000 workers exposed to asbestos was the creation of dozens of “asbestos settlement trusts,” which have paid out tens of billions dollars in damages. Some of them are still going strong today.  The asbestos trusts were seen as an innovative approach to deal with seemingly endless litigation and provide a measure of compensation to sick workers and their families. The system for dealing with claims also allowed some of the hobbled manufacturers to emerge from bankruptcy largely free of the crushing weight of lawsuits.  Now some investors in soured mortgage-backed bonds sold by Bank of America and advocates for struggling homeowners are wondering whether a similar strategy can be used to deal with litigation claims that Wall Street analysts estimate could cost the nation’s biggest bank more than $50 billion.  “We’ve suggested an asbestos-style settlement as a solution. It makes the most sense,” says Vincent Fiorillo, a portfolio manager with DoubleLine Capital, a $15 billion bond shop that has its own pending claims against the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender. “It is better than where we are right now.”  The idea of using the asbestos litigation wars as a model for dealing with the fallout from the financial crisis is more talk than anything else. There’s no indication an asbestos-style litigation trust is something Bank of America is actively considering at the moment.  But efforts to find a creative solution to Bank of America’s multi-pronged exposure to Countrywide’s ailing mortgage portfolio become more urgent with each downward tick in the bank’s already depressed share price.  On Wall Street, once extreme ideas - such as spinning off the bank’s Merrill Lynch investment arm to raise additional capital or placing all of its rotting mortgages into a so-called bad bank managed by federal regulators - are being bandied about quite freely. Calls to break up Bank of America are no longer just idle chatter of hedge fund traders selling short its shares.  Just this week, Chris Whalen, a bank analyst and co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics, was out calling for a Chapter 11 restructuring of Bank of America.  “You need to do something radical, which changes the framework so people can start thinking with their brains again,” says William Black, an associate professor of law and economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law and former litigation director of the old Federal Home Loan Bank Board during the run-up to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.  So far, Bank of America’s management has shied away from drastic measures and instead has begun taking a variety of incremental steps to assure Wall Street it has adequate capital to deal with the onslaught of mortgage-related lawsuits from bond investors, the American International Group, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and others. In August, the bank got a badly needed $5 billion cash infusion from Warren Buffett that helped stop the stock’s 49 percent slide this year. It quickly followed-up that deal by selling half of its stake in China Construction Bank for $8.3 billion.  Chief executive officer Brian Moynihan is also mulling a plan to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs over the next several years. On Tuesday, he began a management shuffle by ousting two top executives, Sallie Krawcheck and Joe Price. Analysts expect even more structural changes in the coming weeks, as Moynihan seeks to give a jolt to the bank’s beaten down stock, currently trading around $7.  The bank has set aside more than $15 billion in litigation reserves and contends it is well-positioned to defend itself against the wave of mortgage-related lawsuits. It is bracing itself for a war of attrition with mortgage bond investors, who claim the bank and its Countrywide subsidiary sometimes knowingly stuffed those securities with shoddy home loans. A bank spokesman declined to comment on whether it would consider an asbestos-style trust to deal with mortgage-related claims.  A Federal Reserve spokesman also declined to comment.  This is not the first time that some have talked about a litigation trust as a mechanism to deal with some of Wall Street’s liability arising from the collapse of the U.S. housing market. In the early days of the financial crisis, regulators discussed the merits of using an asbestos-style trust to resolve potential litigation claims against the biggest U.S. banks. But regulators ultimately rejected the trust concept along with other novel ideas that were deemed either unworkable or politically untenable.  One appeal to a trust solution, according to proponents, is that it would be a way for a bank to essentially hive off its litigation liability and establish a mechanism for dealing with claims and litigation. The advocates suggest it would be a way for Bank of America to get a “fresh start” without involving a bankruptcy or a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-imposed receivership.  But an asbestos trust is no magic bullet either. The insurance industry continues to be plagued with new asbestos-related claims years after the trusts were created. Credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service recently said after asbestos being a “back burner” issues for years, the U.S. insurance industry is recently seeing an uptick in new asbestos claims.  And the problem with any trust is that it must be adequately capitalized. The amount of money the bank would have to commit would no doubt be contentious and costly to shareholders and potentially bondholders as well.  The easiest way to fund a litigation trust would be for Bank of America to issue new shares, something that would severely reduce the value of its existing stock. That’s not the kind of plan that will sit well with stockholders, whose shares are already trading well below the bank’s stated book value of $20 a share.  “You’d have to go to the market and raise capital for this and that would dilute shares,” says Australian hedge fund manager John Hempton, whose Bronte Capital owns a sizable stake in the bank. “That is the last thing BofA wants to do right now.”  Frank Partnoy, a former Wall Street derivatives trader and now a law professor at the University of San Diego, said a litigation trust also could be partially funded by the issuance of a specialized security called a litigation tracking warrant. He said these warrants could be sold to public investors and offered to current Bank of America shareholders allowing them to share in any of the trust’s proceeds that remain after all the litigation has been resolved.  “There are precedents for having publicly traded securities to track how litigation will turn out,” said Partnoy.  He explained that a number of banks issued litigation tracking securities in the wake of the savings and loans crisis, when they tried to sue the federal government for wiping out billions of dollars in goodwill on those institutions’ balance sheets. The tracking stocks were a way for the institutions to raise cash to finance the litigation.  But if some momentum was building for a radical solution, Buffett’s $5 billion investment changed that. Now even some early advocates of an asbestos-style litigation trust are having second thoughts.  “The dynamics have changed dramatically since Buffett entered the picture,” says Sean Egan, a principal of Egan-Jones Ratings Company, an independent rating shop which has eased up on its once bearish view of Bank of America. “It’s a kiss of approval,” he added, even though the bank is paying a rich 6 percent dividend on the preferred stock it sold to Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.  Egan says an asbestos-style trust seemed like a plausible solution during the summer when Bank of America seemed to have few friends in the equity markets. But now, Egan says, to set up a litigation trust would “create a total mess” and “be patently unfair to existing shareholders.”  Just a few months ago, Egan discussed the merits of such a trust with several mortgage-backed securities investors now sparring with Bank of America. Those investors claim the bank is obligated to buy back the underlying home loans in those now soured bonds because the mortgages were issued to homebuyers who either obviously lacked the income to keep making monthly payments, or were duped into taking out greater loans than they could afford.  But Egan says now that the share price hemorrhaging has stopped, Bank of America can focus on taking steps to earn its way out of the litigation crisis.  Much of the search for a radical solution stems from an ongoing debate on Wall Street about whether the bank can earn enough money over time to pay out claims and add money to its legal reserves if necessary.  Most of the bulls who believe Bank of America can earn its way out of its legal quagmire freely admit that the bank’s stock is not likely to do much the next several years. Says Hempton of Bronte Capital: “I own a zombie bank.”  Under a relatively conservative long-term banking industry growth rate of 3.3 percent, Bank of America could earn about $50 billion in pre-tax profits from 2012 through 2016. That’s about equal to the amount most analysts peg the bank’s long-term mortgage legal liability at, if it fares poorly in litigation.  Banking analyst Charles Peabody, a partner with Portales Partners, says the strategy at Bank of America is to shed assets and reduce expenses, and he thinks it can work. “I understand the game plan, and if time is given, they can get through this without raising equity.”  The more bearish investors, by contrast, point out that another recession could throw a big monkey wrench into those profit projections. And predicting legal liability is notoriously difficult. In fact, analysts like Whalen say Bank of America could find itself having to pay as much as $100 billion in damages to mortgage bond investors and homeowners.  Skeptics also point out that in the coming years, Bank of America will need to boost capital by $50 billion in order to comply with new international banking regulations designed to make sure banks are not taking on too much risk.  And next year, Bank of America will need to refinance at least $40 billion in corporate debt that is coming due. In a worst case scenario, the bank has more than $400 billion in liquid assets to pay off any maturing debt.  It’s a lot of capital raising and skeptics worry that could hamper Bank of America’s ability to generate new commercial and residential loans for the next several years. That’s one reason people like Black, who want to break Bank of America apart, say something needs to be done to change the narrative because it’s not healthy for one of the nation’s biggest banks to exist in stasis for years to come.  “If you leave your major banks slowly twisting in the wind in this pathetic zombie condition, they are not going to be effective institutions,” says Black.  In the case of Countrywide, Black says the damage was done to Bank of America the moment that Kenneth Lewis, the bank’s former chief executive officer, pulled the trigger on the deal in early 2008. The Countrywide acquisition was a “pure ego play” for Lewis, who stepped down in December 2009 and was replaced by Moynihan.  In retrospect, if Countrywide had not been acquired and was ultimately taken over by the federal government, it would have been easier for all sides to begin working out deals with financially-strapped borrowers to reduce the principal owed on mortgages and home equity loans. Black says it’s still not too late to do meaningful home loan modifications, but that’s only going to happen in the context of a “bad bank” overseen by an FDIC receiver.  The latest report by the Treasury Department gave low marks to Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co in working to strike deals with struggling homeowners. In a September 1 statement, the Treasury Department said both Bank of America and JPMorgan “remain in need of substantial improvement” when it comes to servicing mortgages and agreeing to permanent loan modifications.  Homeowner advocates say in any kind of overarching settlement - whether it be an asbestos-style trust, a bad bank, or the sale of litigation warrants - borrowers should have a voice as well. A group of them represented by Mississippi attorney Don Barrett has filed an objection to a proposed $8.5 billion settlement that Bank of America reached this summer with some of the nation’s biggest bond investors, including BlackRock, Pacific Investment Management Co. and TCW.  Barrett says homeowners object to the settlement because the terms of the deal would make it even harder to negotiate a loan modification in the future. He cites a recent report prepared by National Consumer Law Center, which concludes that the settlement agreement “will speed up foreclosures, perpetuate existing servicing abuses in the system and undermine federal programs designed to stabilize the housing market.”  The Center, which prepared the report at Barrett’s request, says that in negotiating the deal with big mortgage-backed bond investors, little concern was paid to the interest of the homeowners, who took out the loans that were later bundled into bonds.  “There has got to be a solution where the borrowers’ interests are taken into account. We are the third leg of the stool,” says Barrett. “The current way of doing things is broken. And if it isn’t fixed, it is going to take Bank of America down.” (Additional reporting by Sam Forgione, Ben Berkowitz and Michael Tarsala; editing by Michael Williams and Claudia Parsons)",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankofamerica-solutions/insight-extreme-makeover-bofa-an-asbestos-solution-idUSTRE78854U20110909

Incoming HSBC Hong Kong CEO Fung is also from GBM, which globally accounted for more than 40 percent of the group’s profit before tax in the first six months of the year. Hong Kong accounted for slightly more than a quarter of the group’s profit before tax.

100,BLK,WisdomTree CEO defends leveraged ETFs," *Wisdom CEO says risky investments get a “bad rap”   *CEO says BlackRock’s Fink wrong on “toxic” ETFs   By Jessica Toonkel   Sept. 12 (Reuters)-Leveraged and inverse exchange-traded funds are getting a “bad rap,” Jonathan Steinberg, CEO of WisdomTree Investments Inc. (WETF.O) told investors at a Barclays Capital conference on Monday.   Over the past few years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and state securities regulators have issued warnings about the dangers of owning leveraged ETFs, which seek to amplify returns by using risky debt and derivatives, and inverse ETFs, which employ options strategies to allow investors to short an index.   Last week, published reports said the SEC was investigating whether leveraged ETFs have contributed to recent market volatility.   WisdomTree, which has $13 billion in assets under management, is the eighth largest ETF player in the U.S. The New York-based firm doesn’t offer leveraged and inverse ETFs.   “I have been on the road meeting hundreds and hundreds of advisers and investors and there is a very passionate and narrow universe for leveraged and inverse ETFs,” Steinberg said. “It’s a very tactical trade.”   Steinberg was responding to an earlier comment from the conference made by Laurence Fink, chief executive of BlackRock Inc. (BLK.N). Fink told attendees leveraged ETFs were “toxic.” Steinberg said he disagreed with Fink.   “The rap for them [leveraged and inverse ETFs] is that they don’t deliver the long-term tracking of the index, but they never said they would,” Steinberg said. “The other knock is that they have contributed to the volatility.”   Steinberg said that’s not the case and instead believes regulators are “looking for a scapegoat for the volatility.”  ",9122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/wisdomtree/wisdomtree-ceo-defends-leveraged-etfs-idUSS1E78B1S520110912
101,BLK,UPDATE 2-BlackRock's CEO says money managers have been hurt," * Tough markets pressure money managers, Fink says   * Large investors shunning riskier assets   * ETF business recovering from tracking error mistake   * Says stocks of Siemens, Nestle, Allianz appealing  (Adds comment on Barclays, paragraph 14; clarifies quote on bonds by adding (only), paragraph 6)   Sept 12 (Reuters) - Tumultuous markets and financial problems in Europe are hurting profits in the asset management industry, according to Laurence Fink, chief executive of BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager.   “This (volatility) is not a good short-term trend for the asset management business,” Fink said, speaking in New York at a Barclays Capital conference on Monday.   He said BlackRock, which oversees more than $3.6 trillion, will seek to maintain its profit margin by being “even more disciplined” on expenses.   Most large investors continue to shun equities and other relatively risky assets and favor fixed-income securities, Fink said.   The trend may be appropriate in the short term but not over the long term, he said.   For long-term investors “it makes no sense to have a portfolio of (only) bonds, other than being frightened of the world,” Fink said. “Right now, maybe being frightened of the world is a good position to be in.”   BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded fund business has recovered from problems last year, Fink said, which he blamed on poor management at one particular fund. Performance of the iShares Emerging Market ETF (EEM.P) trailed its benchmark index generating substantial “tracking error,” he said. The problem has been corrected, he said.   BlackRock’s share of net new money coming into U.S. ETFs was 26 percent to 27 percent in the first three quarters of 2010 but fell to 16 percent in the fourth quarter.

103,BLK,BlackRock's CEO says money managers have been hurt,"(Reuters) - Tumultuous markets and financial problems in Europe are hurting profits in the asset management industry, according to Laurence Fink, chief executive of BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager.  “This (volatility) is not a good short-term trend for the asset management business,” Fink said, speaking in New York at a Barclays Capital conference on Monday.  He said BlackRock, which oversees more than $3.6 trillion, will seek to maintain its profit margin by being “even more disciplined” on expenses.  Most large investors continue to shun equities and other relatively risky assets and favor fixed-income securities, Fink said.  The trend may be appropriate in the short term but not over the long term, he said.  For long-term investors “it makes no sense to have a portfolio of bonds, other than being frightened of the world,” Fink said. “Right now, maybe being frightened of the world is a good position to be in.”  BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded fund business has recovered from problems last year, Fink said, which he blamed on poor management at one particular fund. Performance of the iShares Emerging Market ETF (EEM.P) trailed its benchmark index generating substantial “tracking error,” he said. The problem has been corrected, he said.  BlackRock’s share of net new money coming into U.S. ETFs was 26 percent to 27 percent in the first three quarters of 2010 but fell to 16 percent in the fourth quarter. It has since bounced back to 24 percent in the second quarter of 2011, Fink said.  He said BlackRock’s ETF performance was “poor in the last year and much of it was our doing.”  “It wasn’t because of the success of Vanguard,” he added. “It was because of the failure of BlackRock.”  Asked about his favorite stocks, Fink first joked that he was not a portfolio manager. “I’m the overhead,” he said.

105,BLK,Fund view: Lagging gold equities offer investment deal,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Gold equities have underperformed gold prices so far this year, providing an opportunity for investors hoping to ride the metal’s bull run, a senior executive at BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, said on Monday.  Gold equities underperformed bullion prices by 25 percent to 30 percent this year, as gold prices rallied nearly 30 percent and equities market took a hit from mounting worries about the euro zone’s debt crisis and slower global growth.  “That may well be the opportunity,” said Malcolm Smith, Director and product specialist for BlackRock’s Natural Resources Team.  “If investors believe gold prices will remain at these levels or perhaps even go higher, there is an opportunity that gap may well narrow.”  Smith told reporters that historically gold equities have significantly outperformed gold prices, and the window of underperforming equities have tended to be short lived.  “In the past they lasted nine months to a year. I will be hopeful that in the next nine months to a year these gaps may be closed,” Smith told reporters at a press conference.  BlackRock’s World Gold Fund holds shares of companies including Newcrest Mining, the world’s No.3 gold miner, and Kinross Gold, one of the fastest growing gold miners in the world. The fund had $8.34 billion of assets under management by July 31.  Spot gold traded at $1,840 an ounce by 4:39 a.m. ET, down 4 percent from a record high of $1,920.30 hit on September 6, but up nearly 30 percent so far this year.  “Really your question on gold is — Do you believe the world economy will get better or worse? Do you think there will be a cost to move on from where we are today? If the answer is yes, gold is potentially quite interesting,” said Smith.  A rapid reduction on uncertainty in financial markets, a rise in real interest rates around the world, a reassertion of the dollar as the global default currency and a fast increase in gold supply would end gold’s bull run, he said.  “But none of them seems immediately particularly likely, therefore gold prices may well be quite supported.”  Smith’s team manages six funds, including World Gold Fund and the $17-billion World Mining Fund, with total assets under management pegged at $44.9 billion by end of August, the company said.  BlackRock managed $3.66 trillion of assets as of June 30, 2011, according to the company’s website.

107,BLK,Russia plans reforms after elections: Kudrin,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will launch a reform drive next year regardless of who wins parliamentary and presidential elections, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Tuesday.  He was addressing the concerns of investors who are staying out of Russia until they know who will be running the world’s largest country and biggest oil producer, and want assurances that the next government will embark on reforms.  Some investors fear Vladimir Putin’s return as president in March after four years as prime minister would mean stagnation for the $1.5 trillion economy, and see more chance of reforms if Dmitry Medvedev secures six more years in the Kremlin.  “There will, of course, be reforms,” Kudrin told the Reuters Russia Investment Summit.  “I believe the next prime minister will without doubt have a certain amount of credit for carrying out reforms — how much, more or less, will depend on many things including the elections results.”  Touching on many investors’ concerns about the state of Russia’s economy, he underlined the importance of privatization and reforms to protect property rights, establish divisions of power at the top and continue developing the financial sector.  “We need to restart reform of the pension system, carry out reform of housing and communal services, create infrastructure,” he said.  Kudrin, 50, also said taxes would have to be increased to make public finances strong enough to absorb the shock of a possible oil price collapse.  He made clear he thought reforms were irreversible and inevitable in Russia now, 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Putin, 58, and Medvedev, 45, have not said which of them will run in the presidential election in March but Putin is likely to have the final say.  He is more influential than Medvedev despite ushering his protege into the Kremlin in 2008 because the constitution barred him from a third successive term. Few analysts expect a third candidate to emerge.  The uncertainty about which of them will be president for the next six years has helped fuel differences among investors and analysts over how they see prospects for reform in the nuclear power whose population is 142 million.  David Reid, Vice President of Blackrock (BLK.N) asset manager’s Emerging Europe fund, said he thought investors had grounds to be optimistic about Russia and made clear he expected a reform push after the elections.  “I think in the new environment there was strong political incentive to progress on various matters — privatization, WTO (World Trade Organization) accession, oil tax reforms, changes in the monetary policy and currency regime,” Reid said.  “We could hopefully look to the post election period and anticipate an improvement.”  But some guests at the summit in the Reuters Moscow office said a big reform drive was unlikely whatever the outcome of the presidential election and the parliamentary vote on December 4, which Putin’s United Russia party is expected to dominate.  “I think all of this stuff is going to be incremental,” one participant said on condition of anonymity.  Some investors and analysts see a clear difference between the policies of Medvedev and Putin.  “There is a decent likelihood that Medvedev would be more of a reformer than Putin would be, which I think is what this country needs,” said Jacob Grapengiesser, a partner at East Capital asset management group in Russia.  Others say the differences are exaggerated, meaning policy will simply not change much after the elections.  “I don’t think it does matter who is president because I think that the system of governance is very stable and there is a tremendous amount of consensus within the governing elite of the country,” Jeff Costello, chief executive of JP Morgan (JPM.N) in Russia, told Reuters Insider television.  “So whoever is president, I think the policies that have been clearly defining the last 15 years are going to continue no matter who sits in the seat.”  Liam Halligan, chief economist at Russia-focused fund manager Prosperity Capital, said the differences in the images projected by Medvedev and Putin were greater than their policy differences — and they worked effectively as a team.  “Of course on balance Medvedev, on the touchy, feely side looks, a bit better,” he said. “In the economics, broadly there is not that much between them.”  Even so, Arkady Dvorkovich, Medvedev’s top economics adviser, made clear there were still some differences even if the two broadly see eye-to-eye.

109,BLK,Putin to return as president in 2012: poll,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will likely return as president next year and appoint a reformist prime minister, Russia-based economists, bankers and businessmen said.  A poll of more than 20 participants in this week’s Reuters Russia Investment Summit also found about half the respondents thought economic growth in Russia will slow next year because of global financial problems.  Asked about the outcome of the presidential election in March, nine said Putin would return to the Kremlin and name a reformist premier. Three said he would become president again but appoint a conservative to lead the government.  Two respondents said Dmitry Medvedev would remain president, with Putin staying on as prime minister.  In a sign of how sensitive the question is in a country where personal loyalty counts for much and Medvedev and Putin have not said which of them will run, the rest declined to answer.  “An announcement (on who will run) is clearly overdue ... This causes uncertainty because no one knows what the silence means,” political analyst Gleb Pavlovsky said in a recent interview. “This strange process worries investors, the political class and the bureaucracy.”  Some businessmen have held back from investing in Russia because of the uncertainty, fearing Putin’s return after four years as prime minister could herald a period of stagnation.  Other investors have dismissed such concerns, saying they see little difference between the two leaders on economic policy and expected policies to change little next year, regardless of who was president.  Barred by the constitution from seeking a third successive term in 2008, Putin ushered Medvedev into the Kremlin but has remained the paramount leader in the world’s biggest country.  “There is a bit of perception there that Putin will be some kind of candidate for the status quo and Medvedev will be some kind of candidate for reforms and progression,” David Reid, vice president of asset manager BlackRock’s (BLK.N) Emerging Europe fund, told the summit in the Reuters Moscow office.  “But I think both men share many of the same ideas in terms of how to move Russia forward,” he said.  While summit guests were not asked who might become prime minister if Putin returned to power, political analysts have said finance minister Alexei Kudrin was a likely candidate if Putin opts for a reformist.  Participants were also asked what impact Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and recent financial market turmoil would have on Russia in 2012.  Eight of those who responded said the economy would grow 0-3 percent. Six said the economy would continue to grow at a rate of 3-5 percent and one said it would contract. One said he did not know what the impact would be and the rest did not reply.  The participants were also asked what they would invest in if they had $100 million to spare.  Six said they would invest in Russian stocks, five would go for rouble deposits and three said they would buy British property. One would buy gold, one opted for land, one went for a variety of currencies and another chose private companies.

112,BLK,Stop stealing - The reform Russia needs most,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia must wipe out corruption if it is to reform its economy after next year’s presidential election and faces years of budget deficits if it fails to do so, bankers and businessmen said on Wednesday.  Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin told the Reuters Russia Investment Summit he expected a reform drive after the March election and said state spending should be cut to avoid a sharp increase in taxes.  While investors at the summit, including BlackRock (BLK.N) — the world’s largest asset manager — said they were optimistic about the prospects for Russia’s economy after the election, others offered words of caution.  “We all know very well that budget funds are being spent inefficiently,” said Mikhail Alexeyev, the head of the Russian arm of Italian bank UniCredit (CRDI.MI).  “A huge amount of money will continue to be lost. I think taxes will rise and the budget deficit will stay.”  Corruption is widely seen by investors as the main stumbling block to attempts by the world’s largest energy producer to attract foreign direct investment into areas of its $1.5 trillion economy other than the natural resource sector.  The lack of such investment threatens a further delay in Russian efforts to reduce reliance on energy revenue, a dependence which makes it vulnerable to oil price volatility.  The government says Russia needs oil prices to stay above $115 a barrel next year to balance its budget, compared with a spot price of $112 on Wednesday.  Corruption, which has dogged Russia for centuries and affects all levels of business and society, is regularly cited as the main reason why equities in Russia trade at a big discount to emerging-market peers.  Few believe the government can cut spending even after the presidential election, which follows a parliamentary election in December.  “The government will find it difficult to cut spending regardless of how many votes the next president gets. Therefore the only way out (for the government) is to raise taxes,” metals tycoon Vladimir Potanin told the summit. “Business will stop investing. There will be capital outflows,” he said.  Potanin, co-owner of metals company Norilsk Nickel (GMKN.MM) and ranked by Forbes magazine as Russia’s fourth richest man with a fortune of $17.8 billion, expressed dismay at government overuse of oil revenue to support ailing industries.  “No one has spoken about (the fight against) corruption for some time,” Potanin said, referring to one of the main points of President Dmitry Medvedev’s successful 2008 election campaign.  Many political analysts expect Medvedev’s mentor, Vladimir Putin, to return to the Kremlin after four years as prime minister. One option for Putin would be switch positions with Medvedev.  Some of the most bullish investment funds in Russia, such as Prosperity Capital which has $5 billion under management, also said corruption was an important risk for development.  “The Russians want corruption to be addressed and are worried about inflation,” said Liam Halligan, chief economist at Prosperity.  Some analysts put the size of the so-called grey economy in Russia at roughly the size of gross domestic product. The Kremlin’s top economic adviser, Arkady Dvorkovich, told the summit it amounted to about 25 percent of GDP.  “There could be a situation in which we might not be about to move forward in the battle with corruption and I consider that is the risk that is more important than any other,” Dvorkovich said.  Some officials have said a privatization push under way in Russia could help reduce corruption because the private sector was better equipped to deal with it than sprawling state monopolies. Alexeyev said the situation was more complicated.  “Even if the privatization of state banks takes place, it will be only partial and nothing will change — the state will continue appointing executives and we will not expect changes in the way (the sector) is managed,” he said.  Potanin also said the state needed to give the private sector more chance to benefit from the global shift in economic power away from the West.  “I would like to think Russia could benefit from this situation but the truth is that more effective countries will benefit ... If you cannot liquidate inflation and corruption, then at least take them down to single digits,” Potanin said.

113,BLK,Russia plans reforms after elections: Kudrin,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will launch a reform drive next year regardless of who wins parliamentary and presidential elections, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Tuesday.  He was addressing the concerns of investors who are staying out of Russia until they know who will be running the world’s largest country and biggest oil producer, and want assurances that the next government will embark on reforms.  Some investors fear Vladimir Putin’s return as president in March after four years as prime minister would mean stagnation for the $1.5 trillion economy, and see more chance of reforms if Dmitry Medvedev secures six more years in the Kremlin.  “There will, of course, be reforms,” Kudrin told the Reuters Russia Investment Summit.  “I believe the next prime minister will without doubt have a certain amount of credit for carrying out reforms — how much, more or less, will depend on many things including the elections results.”  Touching on many investors’ concerns about the state of Russia’s economy, he underlined the importance of privatization and reforms to protect property rights, establish divisions of power at the top and continue developing the financial sector.  “We need to restart reform of the pension system, carry out reform of housing and communal services, create infrastructure,” he said.  Kudrin, 50, also said taxes would have to be increased to make public finances strong enough to absorb the shock of a possible oil price collapse.  He made clear he thought reforms were irreversible and inevitable in Russia now, 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Putin, 58, and Medvedev, 45, have not said which of them will run in the presidential election in March but Putin is likely to have the final say.  He is more influential than Medvedev despite ushering his protege into the Kremlin in 2008 because the constitution barred him from a third successive term. Few analysts expect a third candidate to emerge.  The uncertainty about which of them will be president for the next six years has helped fuel differences among investors and analysts over how they see prospects for reform in the nuclear power whose population is 142 million.  David Reid, Vice President of Blackrock (BLK.N) asset manager’s Emerging Europe fund, said he thought investors had grounds to be optimistic about Russia and made clear he expected a reform push after the elections.  “I think in the new environment there was strong political incentive to progress on various matters — privatization, WTO (World Trade Organization) accession, oil tax reforms, changes in the monetary policy and currency regime,” Reid said.  “We could hopefully look to the post election period and anticipate an improvement.”  But some guests at the summit in the Reuters Moscow office said a big reform drive was unlikely whatever the outcome of the presidential election and the parliamentary vote on December 4, which Putin’s United Russia party is expected to dominate.  “I think all of this stuff is going to be incremental,” one participant said on condition of anonymity.  Some investors and analysts see a clear difference between the policies of Medvedev and Putin.  “There is a decent likelihood that Medvedev would be more of a reformer than Putin would be, which I think is what this country needs,” said Jacob Grapengiesser, a partner at East Capital asset management group in Russia.  Others say the differences are exaggerated, meaning policy will simply not change much after the elections.  “I don’t think it does matter who is president because I think that the system of governance is very stable and there is a tremendous amount of consensus within the governing elite of the country,” Jeff Costello, chief executive of JP Morgan (JPM.N) in Russia, told Reuters Insider television.  “So whoever is president, I think the policies that have been clearly defining the last 15 years are going to continue no matter who sits in the seat.”  Liam Halligan, chief economist at Russia-focused fund manager Prosperity Capital, said the differences in the images projected by Medvedev and Putin were greater than their policy differences — and they worked effectively as a team.  “Of course on balance Medvedev, on the touchy, feely side looks, a bit better,” he said. “In the economics, broadly there is not that much between them.”  Even so, Arkady Dvorkovich, Medvedev’s top economics adviser, made clear there were still some differences even if the two broadly see eye-to-eye.  Responding to Kudrin’s call to raise taxes after the election, Dvorkovich wrote on his Twitter feed: “No way.”  ",9142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-summit-reforms/russia-plans-reforms-after-elections-kudrin-idUSTRE78C5VE20110914
114,BLK,Judge to solve puzzle over BoFA mortgage removal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion proposed mortgage-backed securities settlement is now in the hands of a New York federal judge. But it could end up back before state court in a legal tug-of-war over who should decide whether the pact passes muster.  The stakes are high for Bank of America, which had hoped the agreement would resolve uncertainty over potential liabilities tied to pools of soured loans sold to investors by Countrywide Financial Corp, the mortgage lender it bought in 2008.  While the proposed settlement was filed in state court in June as a special proceeding and not as a class action, an investor group called Walnut Place LLC removed the case to federal court in late August, arguing it should be treated as a “mass action” under a federal law.  The case is now before U.S. District Judge William Pauley, who may have reasons under class-action law to return the case to New York State Supreme Court, according to some experts.  Or, as sometimes happens in removals, the federal judge keeps the case and the state action ceases unless there are developments later that cause it to be remanded to state court for different reasons.  The settlement was negotiated by Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee for mortgage backed securities in Countrywide, with 22 institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco. Countrywide was the largest U.S. mortgage lender before being taken over by BofA. The agreement also calls for the biggest U.S. bank by assets to improve its mortgage servicing practices.  On September 21, Pauley will hear oral arguments for the bid by Walnut Place for the case to be resolved under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 that requires big-money class actions to be supervised by a federal judge.  “There have been various ways in which the federal court has managed to kick removals out without giving it much of a review but I prefer to think judges see it as part of their job,” said Eugene Beckham of Beckham and Beckham PA in Miami, who has written about removal procedures but is not involved in the mortgage settlement case.  “However, the federal courts can be very unforgiving and if you don’t follow the rules or you don’t have the right allegations they will usually remand it,” Beckham said.  He said that can lead to an attorney fee award or sanctions against lawyers deemed to have incorrectly removed a case.  Lawyers for law firm Grais & Ellsworth are leading the challenge for Walnut Place against the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) settlement.  Walnut Place owns certificates in three of the 530 trusts that are part of the proposed agreement. It argues that the negotiations were held in secret, but BNYM says that BofA said in a December 2010 press release it was in talks with the trustee and institutional investors over trusts, including one in which Walnut Place holds certificates.  BNYM, and some lawyers who are not involved in the litigation said that under the class-action law cited by Walnut, a party needs to be a defendant and there needs to be a claim for monetary relief to have standing to remove the case.  But Walnut’s lawyers said in court papers on Wednesday night that neither of those arguments are plausible.  “Walnut Place intervened as an adverse respondent in the state court proceeding, and BNYM did not oppose the petition to intervene or disagree with its characterization of Walnut Place as an adverse party,” its memorandum said. It said monetary relief “surely” was the $8.5 billion that the trustee had asked the court to direct Bank of America and Countrywide to pay.  Another CAFA requirement is that there must be 100 or more plaintiffs who have filed lawsuits seeking monetary damages. In this case, there is only one plaintiff, the trustee, BNYM.  “It doesn’t immediately appear obvious to me what the tactical benefits would be of removal,” said Chris Keller, partner at Labaton Sucharow, whose two New York pension fund clients were part of a $624 million settlement in Countrywide securities litigation in February.  The proposed BofA settlement was made in New York State Supreme Court under Article 77, a provision that usually covers family trust matters. The agreement covers 530 mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances. BNYM said it took months of negotiations to reach a deal.  New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick rejected Walnut’s efforts to change the case to a class action and to add an “opt-out” provision typical in class actions but not in Article 77 proceedings.  Sara Shanahan, a litigation partner with law firm Sherin and Lodgen in Boston, said BNYM could argue that “if you’re going to remove, you do it early on the proceedings, you don’t get to remove once you think things are going badly for you in the state court proceedings.”  Pauley’s job is to determine whether the case was properly removed and properly pending in federal court, she said.  “If he’s wrong, then that issue can be challenged later on appeal after a lot of additional work,” Shanahan said.

117,BLK,Analysis: Gundlach on top even after court setbacks,"(Reuters) - Even when the newly anointed “bond king” Jeffrey Gundlach suffers some setbacks in an ugly court spat, he manages to come out a winner.  On Friday, a Los Angeles jury found Gundlach liable for breaching his fiduciary duty as well as taking trade secrets and interfering with the contracts of clients at the TCW Group Inc., the asset management firm that fired him in December 2009.  But the jury awarded TCW, a unit of French bank Societe Generale, no damages on the breach of fiduciary duty and interfering with the contracts claims, nor any punitive damages. A judge will determine possible damages on the trade secrets claim later.  Gundlach also won an unpaid wages claim of $66.7 million against TCW and so far he appears to have emerged largely unscathed from the very public court battle.  “Victory!” was all Gundlach said in an email to Reuters after the verdict was announced on Friday.  And that might not be just hype even from a bond fund manager who refers to himself as “The Godfather”.  Dubbed earlier this year in Barron’s weekly as the new “King of Bonds,” Gundlach is also set to attract an additional wave of investor money.  Already, Gundlach has amassed more than $16 billion at DoubleLine Capital, the firm he started in January 2010, weeks after his firing.  The majority of DoubleLine’s impressive growth thus far has come from retail investors. They added $3.6 billion to DoubleLine’s mutual funds last year and another $6.2 billion this year through the end of August, according to Lipper data.  For their part, institutional investors, including pension funds, foundations and endowments, have largely shied away from DoubleLine because of the litigation and the risks of negative headlines that follow.  That is likely to change now. And that could make DoubleLine a more formidable competitor against the largest bond managers like BlackRock, Allianz’s PIMCO unit and Legg Mason’s Western Asset Management.  “Given DoubleLine’s extraordinary investment performance and the positive trial outcome, we anticipate that institutional investors will now be eager to do business with DoubleLine,” said John Frank, managing principal at Oaktree Capital Management, a firm with $80 billion under management.  Oaktree, founded by another TCW refugee, Howard Marks, put up $20 million to help get DoubleLine started in 2010. Oaktree got a 20 percent ownership stake in return, Gundlach revealed at the trial.  A fixed-income investment officer at a major pension fund told Reuters that if the verdict went against Gundlach, it would have been tough to invest with DoubleLine. He said the verdict has “lifted a cloud” for Gundlach.  Gundlach has always had an enviable track record when it comes to his investing prowess. And he has made numerous public appearances at conferences and on television to promote his new firm.  “He’s the closest thing you have to a rock star in the bond market,” Lawrence Glazer, managing partner of Boston-based Mayflower Advisors, said. “It’s not just his performance record. It’s also his personality.”  Glazer’s firm, which oversees $800 million mainly for wealthy clients, invested with Gundlach at TCW and moved to follow him at DoubleLine.  Gundlach’s latest mutual fund, the DoubleLine Core Fixed Income Fund, has gained 11.04 percent over the past 12 months, beating all of the more than 1,000 competing funds in its category, according to Morningstar.  The list includes both the team that took over his old fund, the TCW Core Fixed Income Fund, which gained 6.45 percent, as well as famed PIMCO manager Bill Gross’s PIMCO Total Return Fund, which gained only 3.22 percent.  TCW struggled with outflows after Gundlach left. Institutional investors withdrew $20.5 billion from TCW in 2010 and another $300 million in the first quarter of 2011, according to eVestment Alliance, a market research firm.  The outflows have since ended as TCW brought in $378 million from institutions in the second quarter of 2011.

119,BLK,UPDATE 1-UniCredit shareholder sees problems with new cap hike," * Small shareholder foundation wary about cap hike   * UniCredit weighing options to boost capital   * Board meeting on Tuesday   (Adds background)	   TREVISO, Italy, Sept 19 (Reuters) - UniCredit  shareholder Fondazione Cassamarca would have problems underwriting a new capital increase at Italy’s largest bank by assets, it said on Monday, highlighting unease among the bank’s shareholder foundations over a possible capital hike.	   “Given we already subscribed to two capital increases, we would have some problems with a third,” Cassamarca’s Chairman Dino De Poli, whose foundation holds a stake of just under 1 percent in UniCredit, told reporters.	   “UniCredit must find out whether the possibility of a capital increase gets the consensus of the foundations and is within their means,” he said.	   So far this year, UniCredit is the only big Italian bank to stay out of a new, 11 billion euro round of capital calls aimed at meeting Basel III requirements ahead of schedule. 	   Expectations have grown that it too will have to launch a capital increase — which would be its third since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. 	   UniCredit CEO Federico Ghizzoni said in a newspaper interview last week that shareholders were ready to support such a move and, according to sources close to the situation, discussed the possibility of a capital increase in a meeting with the bank’s strategic committee on Sept. 13.	   A board meeting is scheduled on Tuesday and the capital increase option is likely to be raised again there, although it is not officially on the agenda.	   Analysts say one of the major constraints to a capital hike is the limited cash availability of the bank’s core shareholder foundations — which have strong political links and together own about 11 percent of UniCredit — and their need for an annual cash flow from their investments as high as possible.	   “With UniCredit knowing full well that the money they give us is the foundations’ lifeline, they can’t give us money (through dividend payments) and then immediately take it away from us,” said De Poli.	   Besides the foundations, key foreign shareholders — a diverse group that includes Abu Dhabi’s Aabar fund, investment fund Blackrock and German insurer Allianz — own some 20 percent of UniCredit, although a 7.5 percent stake in Libyan hands is currently frozen.	  Analysts say a 30-percent share price fall over the past month alone amid growing jitters over Italy being sucked into the euro zone debt crisis has further complicated any decision on a capital increase.	   “The market is betting against a capital increase in the short-term, which they had been discounting until now, because the stock is so low at the moment, it would mean too much dilution,” said a London-based analyst who asked not to be named.  	  “They missed an opportunity to do it earlier. But at the end of the day it all boils down to the regulator, Bank of Italy, if they ask them to do it or not,” he added.	  Ghizzoni has said other options to increase core capital would be risk weighted asset reductions and asset sales, although UniCredit recently denied reports that it is planning to sell its Polish and Turkish operations.     	  UniCredit’s stock has halved in value so far this year, compared with a 35 percent decline year-to-date in the STOXX Europe 600 banking index . The shares were down 0.9 percent at 0.7135 euros by 1320 GMT.

Banks across the region, which have been busy peddling Asia-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs), are now scrambling to ensure similar nasty surprises are not lurking on their books, according to financial industry sources in Hong Kong and Singapore.  Asia-focused ETFs are unique in that they allow foreign funds to gain exposure to markets that have difficult foreign investment rules, such as China and India. The ETFs also offer a cheap and effective hedge against existing stock portfolios.  UBS stunned markets last week after announcing unauthorized trades, allegedly concealed by executing fake exchange-traded funds positions, had racked up huge losses. London trader Kweku Adoboli was charged with fraud and false accounting dating back to 2008.  ETFs focused on countries and sub-regions in Asia-Pacific managed about $138 billion at the end of August, up 25 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data.  Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), BlackRock (BLK.N) and Societe Generale’s (SOGN.PA) Lyxor are some of the biggest ETF providers in the region.  However, the growing popularity of what are called synthetic ETFs is causing particular worries.  A synthetic ETF uses derivatives to track the movements of an underlying share index rather than using the shares themselves. Because they rely on some kind of swap contract, usually with an investment bank, they come with an inherent counterparty risk.  “Investors want exposure to India and China so it’s natural there’s a market for these products here, but you mustn’t forget there’s got to be a market maker and if they see too much profit in that kind of contract then history tells us it will become bigger beyond what they can manage,” said Professor Jin-Chuan Duan, director of the Risk Management Institute at the National University of Singapore.  Another area of concern are “quanto” products. These are derivative instruments such as stock index futures that are denominated in a currency other than the base currency.  A trader of equity derivatives including index products at an Asian bank in Hong Kong said that an example of these would be the MSCI Taiwan futures contract listed in Singapore but denominated in U.S. dollars.  For the investors, the product offers a fixed rate of interest thereby eliminating the currency risk. For the bank offering the instrument, however, it means that they have to not only hedge against the movements in the Taiwan share index but also the movements of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar.  Quanto products are not as popular in Asia as they are in Europe, said the trader, but the recent volatility in Asian currencies could make them vulnerable to errors in risk management.  Mounting fears about a Greek default have recently prompted foreign investors to slash their bets on Asian currencies, which had only a month ago been widely expected to keep appreciating. That has caused, for example, 30-day realized volatility in the South Korean won to jump to the highest since early January.  As a result, many fund managers have been scrambling to hedge their exposure to Asian currencies.  Regulators aren’t ignoring the risks. Hong Kong’s market watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, said last month that synthetic ETF managers needed to ensure their products were 100 percent collateralized to mitigate the risk of an investor losing their money.  The SFC’s tough stance has caused some ETF providers to decide not to list in the city.  “We have seen some cases where overseas ETF issuers have decided not to cross-list their ETFs in Hong Kong because they are unable to comply with the Hong Kong requirements,” said Eva Chan, a lawyer at Simmons & Simmons in Hong Kong, who specializes in advising investment funds.  But a tough policy in one jurisdiction may not be enough to guard against the wider systemic risks when other regulators have laxer policies in place.  “ETF growth is good for financial market growth and many jurisdictions like to see that happen,” said Duan at Singapore’s Risk Management Institute.  He argues regulators should consider limiting the proportion of synthetic ETFs within an investment bank’s trading portfolio.  “It’s always very hard politically to make a financial institution retract from its current position when it’s already too big as they have the whole infrastructure and payroll in place, so it’s better to stop it getting to that position,” he said.  Banks in Asia are already likely to be reassessing the risks of these products, even if there is little evidence yet that it was anything specific about them that caused UBS’s rogue trades.  ‘Delta One’ trading desks, like the one where UBS’s Adoboli worked, were generally regarded as a low-risk type of dealing compared to other investment banking activities.  The desk would give a client exposure to a particular market such as Indian equities by selling them an ETF and then cover the risk they were taking on by buying the underlying equities or derivatives linked to them.  Market veterans say ‘Delta One’ trading is relatively straight-forward compared to the complex derivatives linked to securitized mortgages and commercial paper that were at the center of the 2008 financial crisis.  “You don’t need a cast of thousands and you don’t need rocket scientists to do this, that’s maybe why it slipped under the radar - it was a very vanilla business,” said Charlie Brown, a former product structurer at UBS, who now runs derivatives consultancy MathFinance Asia.  Now market sources in Asia say banks’ risk-control departments are scrambling to check their ‘Delta One’ desks to ensure they have no unpleasant hidden surprises.  “Obviously this affects traders across the street because every compliance department, every risk-control manager are calling over these guys now worried that they would be doing the same thing,” said a banker in Hong Kong who looks after synthetic equities and ETF sales but declined to be identified.

121,BLK,Analysis: Fed's twist moves hurts company pension plans,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve’s ‘Operation Twist’ to bring down bond yields and stimulate the economy is likely to cause pain for the nation’s largest pension funds, already struggling with funding shortfalls from the recent stock market decline.  Hit both by falling stock prices and falling bond yields, the 100 largest pension plans of public U.S. companies have assets covering only 79 percent of their liabilities as of the end of August, down from 86 percent at the end of 2010, according to consulting firm Milliman Inc.  Already approaching its all-time low of 70.1 percent in August, 2010, the funding ratio could fall below 60 percent within two years if equities stagnate and rates decline further, Milliman projected.  “I’ve said rates were at historic lows for three years now and they keep going lower,” John Ehrhardt, a principal in the firm’s New York office, said.  Corporate pensions were well funded back in 2007 before the financial crisis hit, but even though the stock market has recouped most of its losses, falling bond yields have prevented the funds from regaining their solid footing.  “The bond market tends to be the forgotten side of the equation,” David Kelly, a principal at consulting firm Mercer in Chicago, said. “The interest rate risk turns out to be at least as large a risk factor as equity risk for pensions.”  The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced its latest effort to lower yields and kick start the economy through $400 billion of bond purchases.  That could drive down the yields on AA-rated corporate bonds and related benchmarks used by the pension funds to calculate their liabilities.  Most private U.S. defined benefit plans, which oversee about $2 trillion, are hurt when long-term yields decline because of the way the plans must value future payouts they will make to retirees in coming decades.  The total doesn’t include the more popular defined contribution plans, like 401(K)’s, which contain almost $5 trillion and put the onus on workers to manage their own finances. Those plans have been hit by falling markets, too, but do not face the same accounting challenge.  Lower rates mean the future benefits have a higher present value, ballooning the defined benefit funds’ liabilities. Pension consultants estimate a 1.0 percent drop in rates increases liabilities by 10 percent to 15 percent.  Well-managed pensions are supposed to match the current worth of their assets and liabilities. In essence, a present value calculation estimates how much it would cost to borrow the total future liabilities right now and deducts the cost of the interest.  Falling rates also increase the value of any bonds the funds may own but most pension portfolios tilt more toward equities and away from fixed income assets. And bonds they do own tend to be in shorter maturities, which appreciate less when rates fall.  “Unfortunately, the vast majority of pension funds continue to pursue aggressively mis-matched strategies,” said Bradley Belt, senior managing director at the Milken Institute and the former head of the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.  If the funds’ assets fall short, companies that sponsor the plans for their workers will have to increase their annual contributions by tens of billions of dollars over the next few years, Belt said. And if the companies ultimately fall short, the PBGC’s government insurance would be on the hook.  Laurence Fink, chief executive of money manager BlackRock, called the pension situation and similar underfunding of individual retirement accounts “probably the largest crisis that the U.S. is going to face.” Speaking at a conference in New York on September 12, Fink said low rates were having a “dramatic impact” in harming pension funds.  BlackRock, which oversees $3.7 trillion for pension funds and other investors, is urging many of its corporate pension plan clients to match assets and liabilities more closely, in part by shifting money from equities to bonds.  But with the funding ratios and bond rates so low, the matching programs should be phased in over several years, Andy Hunt, managing director at BlackRock in New York, said. “Pension plans need to learn the lessons of the past few years and set themselves on the right course for the future,” Hunt said.  Further damage from lower rates is likely despite the fact that some closely watched rates, like the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, are already at historically low levels.  “Rates can still drop further,” Leonard Grimando, director of corporate ratings at Standard & Poor’s in New York, warned, noting that pension fund benchmarks are much higher than the 1.9 percent 10-year Treasury yield.  On average, companies rated by S&P used a discount rate of 5.34 percent in 2010, down from 5.85 percent in 2009.  “The current rate would now be slightly below 5 percent,” Grimando said.

122,BLK,"BofA mortgage pact no ""sweetheart"" deal: lawyer","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A proposed $8.5 billion settlement of Bank of America Corp’s mortgage-backed securities liability is not a “sweetheart deal” to help the bank, a lawyer for institutional investors argued in court on Wednesday in a legal tussle over the agreement.  A federal judge reserved decision after hearing oral arguments over whether or not the case should be sent back to New York state court, where Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the trustee for the mortgage securities, presented a settlement in June for approval.  Wednesday’s hearing was called because an investor group opposed to the settlement, Walnut Place LLC, moved the case to Manhattan federal court in late August, arguing it should be treated as a “mass action” under a federal law.  “This was no collusive, self-selective group of people who decided to get into a room and cut a sweetheart deal with Bank of America,” lawyer Robert Madden, representing 22 institutional investors who want the pact approved in state court, told the judge. “It was in no way intended to assist Bank of New York Mellon or Bank of America.”  U.S. District Judge William Pauley peppered lawyers for Bank of New York Mellon and Walnut Place with questions in the bid by Walnut for the case to be resolved under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) of 2005. CAFA requires big-money class actions to be supervised by a federal judge.  The judge gave the parties a week to file more written legal arguments.  The proposed settlement was filed in state court as a special proceeding known as Article 77 and not as a class action. Walnut Place argued in court papers that negotiations between the trustee and investors were held in secret.  The trustee said it gave public notice of talks over eight or nine months with investors including BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE’s Pimco.  The stakes are high for Bank of America, which had hoped the agreement would resolve uncertainty over potential liabilities tied to pools of soured loans sold to investors by Countrywide Financial Corp, the mortgage lender it bought in 2008. Countrywide was the largest U.S. mortgage lender before being taken over by BofA.  The proposed agreement also calls for the biggest U.S. bank by assets to improve its mortgage servicing practices.  Bank of New York Mellon lawyer Matthew Ingber asked Pauley to reject Walnut Place’s arguments to have the case continue before him.  “We are not extinguishing any rights of Walnut,” Ingber said. “We think Walnut should be standing side by side with the trustee.”  He said the $8.5 billion payment and the requirement that Bank of America improve its servicing could not otherwise be obtained.  Walnut Place’s lawyer, Owen Cyrulnik, said that in federal court there were equivalents to the Article 77 special proceeding, including the class-action statute.  “It would be amazing for a trustee to have the kind of discretion Bank of New York Mellon claims it has to settle on behalf of these trusts,” Cyrulnik said.  Walnut owns certificates in three of the 530 trusts that are part of the proposed agreement.  Article 77 in state court usually covers family trust matters. The agreement covers 530 mortgage pools with $174 billion of unpaid principal balances.  The cases are In re: The Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011; and The Bank of New York Mellon et al v.

126,BLK,FACTBOX-BofA races to sell assets," Sept 23 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s  (BAC.N) push to shed assets and build its capital base is in high gear.   The largest U.S. bank company is ridding itself of investments and businesses it considers “noncore” in order to raise cash and lower the asset base that determines its regulatory capital requirements. The deals range from significant dispositions such as its $8.6 billion Canadian credit card portfolio to more mundane divestitures, such as stock in a Pizza Hut franchisee.   In late August, the company staved off investor fears that it would be forced into a dilutive equity offering by lassoing a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. But concerns linger because the bank continues to battle billions of dollars of losses relating to residential mortgages and litigation, and faces tougher capital rules that will be phased in beginning in 2013.   Bank of America has announced some $46 billion of asset sales since 2010, including about $11 billion from shedding money management giant BlackRock (BLK.N), with the pace of deals accelerating in recent months.   The following have been announced, or reported to be on the block, since the start of this year:   February 3: Sells Balboa insurance portfolio for more than $700 million to Australia’s QBE Insurance. The sale contributed to a $3 billion capital raise that was a provision in its agreement to pay off U.S. government bailout aid.   April 2011: Sells its $200 million United Kingdom small-business loan portfolio to Barclays PLC. Terms were not disclosed, and a bank spokesman declined to give a specific date for the transaction.   May 19: Announces sale of its remaining stake in BlackRock for about $2.5 billion.   June 6: Sells a $1 billion credit card portfolio to Regions Financial Corp (RF.N). The deal comprised about 500,000 accounts of Regions customers that were serviced by Bank of America.   July 7: Sells Balboa Insurance’s life insurance division to St. Paul, Minnesota-based Securian Financial Group Inc. Terms were not disclosed.   August 3: Sells a credit card business in Spain to Apollo Capital Management. Terms were not disclosed.   August 5: Sells servicing rights on a pool of 400,000 mortgages to Fannie Mae. The purchase price on the loans that had unpaid principal of $73 billion was more than $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported.   August 15: Agreed to sell an $8.6 billion credit card portfolio in Canada to TD Bank Group (TD.TO) for an undisclosed amount, and announcement of the possible sale of card businesses in the U.K. and Ireland.   August 25: Billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) buys $5 billion of preferred stock in a private offering. Berkshire also receives warrants to purchase up to 700 million common shares of Bank of America over the next decade at $7.14 per share.   August 29: Sells half of its stake in China Construction Bank for $8.3 billion.   September 15: Sells 80.8 million shares in hospital operator HCA Holdings Inc back to the company for about $1.5 billion. The bank has received roughly $3 billion in proceeds from the original $1 billion that Merrill Lynch & Co investment made in 2006. Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch (and its almost half-interest in BlackRock, in early 2009).   September 22: Reuters reports bank’s plan to sell almost $1 billion of performing and delinquent commercial real estate loans to an investor group including Invesco Ltd (IVZ.N) and Square Mile Capital Management. The loans are tied to 32 properties.   September 22: Bloomberg reports bank’s planned sale of a stake in NPC International, which operates the biggest Pizza Hut franchise in the United States, for more than $800 million.

127,BLK,ETF industry braces itself for transparency push,"PARIS (Reuters) - Top heavyweights from the $1.3 trillion exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry are bracing themselves for a shift in how their fast-growing but relatively opaque products are marketed, distributed and regulated.  During a three-hour hearing in Paris on Monday, executives from ETF providers like BlackRock, Societe Generale unit Lyxor and Natixis unit Ossiam picked apart the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) recent proposals to make ETFs more transparent and ultimately less risky for investors.  But despite some pushback on details such as how ETFs should be labeled, what information should be disclosed and how their risk levels might be controlled, some executives acknowledged the broad push toward more transparency was inevitable.  “Everybody is reasonably okay with the proposals,” BlackRock Director Stefan Kaiser told Reuters on the sidelines of the hearing. “People realize that something will happen, if anything because clients are demanding it.”  ETFs are mutual funds traded like a stock and are popular because of their cheap fees. Although regulatory concerns have been brewing for months, they have most recently been caught up in alleged rogue trades that triggered $2.3 billion losses at Swiss bank UBS.

128,BLK,ETF industry braces itself for transparency push," * Execs face off against regulators at public hearing   * Proposals “reasonably OK,” change inevitable - exec   * More transparency, disclosure for retail investors-reg   * UBS woes, bank trading oversight not within ESMA’s remit   By Lionel Laurent   PARIS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Top heavyweights from the $1.3 trillion exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry are bracing themselves for a shift in how their fast-growing but relatively opaque products are marketed, distributed and regulated.   During a three-hour hearing in Paris on Monday, executives from ETF providers like BlackRock (BLK.N), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) unit Lyxor and Natixis (CNAT.PA) unit Ossiam picked apart the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) recent proposals to make ETFs more transparent and ultimately less risky for investors.   But despite some pushback on details such as how ETFs should be labelled, what information should be disclosed and how their risk levels might be controlled, some executives acknowledged the broad push towards more transparency was inevitable.   “Everybody is reasonably okay with the proposals,” BlackRock Director Stefan Kaiser told Reuters on the sidelines of the hearing. “People realise that something will happen, if anything because clients are demanding it.”   ETFs are mutual funds traded like a stock and are popular because of their cheap fees. Although regulatory concerns have been brewing for months, they have most recently been caught up in alleged rogue trades that triggered $2.3 billion losses at Swiss bank UBS UBSN.VX (UBS.N).

129,BLK,ETF industry veterans want to buy European funds,"(Reuters) - Two former top executives from iShares, the world’s biggest exchange-traded fund manager, are looking to buy out some of the ETF market’s smaller players.  Lee Kranefuss, who headed iShares before it was bought by BlackRock Inc in 2009, and Rory Tobin, head of iShares’ international side until 2010, said they opened a new firm called ETF Opportunity Partners with a plan to grow through acquisitions.  The firm is on the hunt mainly for European ETFs being run by investment banks and others outside of the money management business, Kranefuss said.  Regulators in Europe are looking to improve disclosures and possibly curb sales of complex funds to retail investors. Even the largest ETF sponsors there, such as iShares, Societe Generale unit Lyxor and Natixis unit Ossiam, are bracing for new regulations. Smaller players may find the business no longer profitable.  “In Europe, there’s been an explosion of products from firms that aren’t fiduciary asset managers,” Kranefuss said. “Now there’s a huge regulatory push on ETFs. We think there’s going to be consolidation.”  The ETF began in the United States as a more-easily traded form of an index mutual fund. Almost all U.S. ETFs directly own a portfolio of stocks or bonds, but in Europe so-called structured funds backed by derivatives contracts are more common.  The $300 billion European ETF market is also far more fragmented than the $1 trillion U.S. market, where iShares, State Street Corp and Vanguard Group oversee more than 80 percent of ETF assets.  Kranefuss said his new firm might have to alter how acquired funds are managed, such as by switching to safer derivatives contracts or moving to the U.S. model of owning stocks and bonds directly.  “Our default will be that people ought to be holding what the fund suggests it holds,” he said.

131,BLK,Chaoda Modern accused of fraud by online activists Anonymous," * Anonymous allege Chaoda management siphoned money out of co   * Chaoda facing lawsuit from HK Market Misconduct Tribunal   * Anonymous says to release more reports on corporate fraud   * Anonymous has indirect interest in Chaoda share price falling    By Rachel Armstrong	   SINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - An online activist group has alleged the management of Chinese fruit and vegetable producer Chaoda Modern Agriculture (Holdings) Ltd , already under investigation in Hong Kong for market misconduct, has defrauded the company of more than $400 million. 	   Anonymous Analytics, which says it is a faction of cyber hacking group Anonymous, has published a 38-page report accusing the company of misleading investors about its cash holdings, capital expenditure, and falsifying its financial statements.	   On Monday, before Anonymous published their report, Hong Kong’s government confirmed the city’s Market Misconduct Tribunal was investigating Chaoda although declined to give any further details. The news of that investigation sent Chaoda shares tumbling more than 26 percent before they were suspended from trade. 	   Chaoda’s shares are already down around 76 percent since late May, when it was accused in Chinese-language Next Magazine of overstating the size of its farmland in Beijing, Hebei, Tianjin and Fujian. 	   The company denied all of those allegations and brought back some of its own shares after the report caused its stock to drop 22 percent. 	   In the latest report, Anonymous claimed Chaoda management had siphoned out about 2.3 billion yuan ($360 million) from the company under the guise of capital expenditure. 	   Anonymous also alleges that Chaoda’s main fertilizer supplier, Fujian Chaoda Trading, which Chaoda chairman Kwok Ho has a majority stake in, is in fact a shell company used to smuggle money out of the company. 	   “Under the cover of inflated capex spending and related party transactions, management has transferred more than $400 million out of Chaoda,” the report concluded.  	   Eric Yip, a spokesman at Chaoda’s public relations agency, said the company is looking at the report and may issue a clarification statement later. On Monday, the company said its shares were suspended from trading pending the release of price sensitive information. 	   A string of Chinese companies listed in North America have been accused of fraud by investors which held short-positions in their stock. This, however, is the first major report of this kind issued on a company listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.	   Anonymous, better known for hacking government and company websites, said it plans to release more reports exposing companies it claims are fraudulent. 	   Anonymous disclosed that it has an indirect interest in a fall in Chaoda’s share price due to short positions held by its “associates, partners, affiliates, consultants, clients, and other related parties”.  	   According to Thomson Reuters data, Blackrock Financial Management Inc held a 4.3 percent stake in the company as of September 14 while Janus Capital Management was recorded on March 22 as having an 8.13 percent holding.	   Chaoda, which listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in 2000, says on its website that it has more than 44,282 hectares of farmland at 31 different production bases across China. It said it grew and sold 2.7 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables in 2010.

132,BLK,iShares Canadian arm launches video campaign,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Investing, like cooking, can be a very complex and daunting process, but at its most basic level, anyone can do it.  That’s the message of a new series of videos aimed at helping average people master the basics of investing by Bruce Sellery, a financial planning expert and former financial journalist, in collaboration with the Canadian unit of money manager BlackRock Inc’s iShares division.  “I want to teach every single Canadian how to make cheesy scrambled eggs,” Sellery said, taking the cooking analogy to another level. “What you need are eggs, milk, cheddar cheese, a fry pan, and an element. That’s all you need.”  “Let’s not get held back by the fact that people don’t know the difference between blue cheese and brie and gorgonzola - let’s just get them doing the basics.”  The five short videos on the iShares Canada website and iShares Canada YouTube channel cover prioritizing financial goals, whether or not to use a financial adviser, understanding an investment portfolio, rebalancing investments, an understanding passive versus active investing.  The segments were gleaned from Sellery’s book, “Moolala: Why smart people do dumb things with money (and what you can do about it)”, and are the first step in a broader public education campaign by iShares Canada, said Mary Anne Wiley, a managing director at BlackRock Canada.  “This is an important message for our advisers and for their clients and for people who are building portfolios on their own,” she said. “Education is a critical element of investing, and investing is daunting ... particularly in stressful times like this.”  iShares is Canada’s top exchange-traded funds provider, with C$27.7 billion ($26.6 billion) in assets under management as of the end of August.  It competes in the ETF space against Claymore Investments, Jovian Capital Corp, Bank of Montreal, First Asset Investment Management Inc, and Invesco Trimark. Royal Bank of Canada and Vanguard are the latest entrants to Canada’s ETF market.  BlackRock is the world’s biggest money manager by assets, with $3.659 trillion in assets under management, as at June 30.

Axa said on Wednesday it was exploring the possible sale of its private equity unit. 	   One of the sources, confirming press reports that first offers were due next week, added this was “only the start of the process”, one which could take time to conclude.	   The Financial Times had reported private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & CO and asset management giant BlackRock were among a handful of bidders that had been asked to submit first offers early next week for Axa Private Equity.	   Other observers believe the AXA unit’s own management could launch a buyout with help from some of its limited partners, while acknowledging the unit’s management still might have to tolerate being taken over by a rival such as BlackRock or KKR.	   Separately, French newspaper La Tribune, which recently said French investment company Eurazeo , KKR, and Carlyle  could be among potential bidders, said French authorities were closely watching the sale.	   AXA Private Equity executives were scheduled to meet French authorities on Monday at the Elysee palace, a day before the deadline for submitting the bids, the paper said, which did not cite a specific source.	   AXA denied the report, calling it “completely false”.	   “(AXA Chairman) Dominique Sénequier never heard anything about this meeting involving her,” a source within the AXA group said.	   Still, one banker noted France would probably do its best to avoid AXA Private Equity falling into the hands of a U.S. rival.	   “The risk for the Paris market is that progressively it becomes nothing more than a place where the big fund companies have outposts,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.	   Reuters and other media reported last week that AXA was considering a sale of the private equity unit, which has 20 billion euros ($27.3 billion) under management. 	  One source told Reuters the unit could be worth $1.5 billion, while others said it was likely to fetch substantially less.

136,BLK,UPDATE 1-Record $512 bln shortfall for big US pensions," * Pension shortfall largest since end of World War II   * Falling stocks and interest rates hurt   * Plans may have to restrict payouts, freeze accruals  (Adds analyst quote, background)   Oct 4 (Reuters) - September was another cruel month for large U.S. pension plans, as stock losses and lower interest rates caused the shortfall between their assets and liabilities to balloon to the largest gap since the end of World War II.   Pension consulting firm Mercer calculated that pension plans of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 1500 Index had a $512 billion shortfall at the end of September, a whopping $134 billion increase during the month.   Worldwide, stocks fell 9 percent in September as measured by the MSCI World equity index. Most large pension funds have the bulk of their assets invested in equities.   At the same time, the funding shortfall has been exacerbated by the Federal Reserve’s efforts to bring down long-term interest rates.   Pension funds use long-term bond rates to calculate the current value of future payouts they will have to make to retirees. When interest rates fall, the current value of the obligations increases. [ID:nS1E78L0O9]   The discount rate, used by pension funds to value future liabilities, fell by 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point during September, Mercer said.   “The end of September marks the largest deficit since we have been tracking this information,” Jonathan Barry, a partner at Mercer, said in a statement. “This will have significant consequences for plan sponsors. It will be particularly painful for organizations with September 30 fiscal and/or plan year ends.”   Measured as a percentage of future liabilities, pension funds in the Mercer survey had assets covering only 72 percent of their obligations at the end of September. That was down from 79 percent at the end of August and 81 percent at the start of the year.   The previous low was 71 percent in August 2010, though the dollar value of the shortfall at that time was $507 billion.   With the weak economy and some prominent companies that have large pension plans experiencing financial turmoil, the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp could end up responsible for some of the shortfalls.   The premium-funded agency has not seen any major insured losses for the past two years but is still underfunded, noted Bradley Belt, senior managing director at the Milken Institute in Washington, D.C., and a former head of the PBGC.   The lack of losses “may change given the economic slowdown, the increased risk of a recession and reports of possible high-profile bankruptcies of companies with sizable pension plans,” Belt said.   Investors have driven the stock prices of American Airlines’ parent, AMR Corp AMR.N, and Eastman Kodak EK.N up and down in recent weeks on fears of financial weakness.   Kodak said on Monday it had “no intention” of filing for bankruptcy. [ID:nN1E79219L]   Analysts said a bankruptcy filing by American was not imminent. [ID:nN1E7930HB]   The shortfall has drawn concern from top money managers, as well. Laurence Fink, chief executive of money manager BlackRock (BLK.N), called the pension situation and similar underfunding of individual retirement accounts “probably the largest crisis that the U.S. is going to face.”   Speaking at a conference in New York on Sept. 12, Fink said low interest rates were having a “dramatic impact” in harming pension funds.   The shortfalls could require companies to increase their contributions to the plans. In the most extreme cases, plans might be required to restrict lump sum payouts and freeze accrual of benefits for their employees, Mercer’s Barry said.

138,BLK,BlackRock launches first retail alternative funds,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is launching its first alternative mutual funds for retail investors.  Given the recent dramatic swings in the market, financial advisers are increasingly looking for investment products that do not correlate to the markets, Frank Porcelli, head of BlackRock’s U.S. retail business, told the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit on Wednesday.  “There’s never been a more difficult time to navigate financial markets than where we are today,” Porcelli said.  As a result, many broker-dealers are trying to increase their clients’ use of alternative investments, which are not correlated to the markets. But they are having trouble doing so, he said.  For example, one national broker-dealer with $1.7 trillion in assets recently came to BlackRock asking the firm to help increase clients’ allocation to alternatives. While the firm wanted to see on average a 10 percent allocation to alternatives, the actual client holding of alternatives was less than 1 percent, Porcelli said.  The problem was that this firm, like many, offered hedge-like funds only to very high-net-worth investors. That is why BlackRock is launching alternative mutual funds for retail investors with just $1,000 to invest.  This week, BlackRock unveils a long/short emerging markets fund, a commodities strategies fund and a long/short credit opportunities fund.  In starting the funds, the New York-based asset manager enters a somewhat crowded market. Almost half of the 247 alternative mutual funds on the market today have been launched in the last three years, according to Morningstar Inc.  But if BlackRock can show strong performance, there is definitely growing demand for these products, said Jeff Tjornehoj, senior research analyst at Lipper.  “If you are 100 percent long or 100 percent short, you are likely to end up nowhere,” Tjornehoj said. “But with a clever manager and the right strategy, you can edge some gains from this seesaw market.”  Specifically, there is growing demand in long-short debt funds, said Mallory Horejs, an alternatives analyst at Morningstar Inc. “Our data shows that investors are over-allocated to fixed income right now, so funds that hedge credit and/or interest rate risk hold widespread appeal.”  As of September 30, investors had poured $4.89 billion so far this year into the 13 long/short debt funds that Morningstar has in its database. As a response to investor interest in these funds, Morningstar is going to give long/short debt funds their own category this fall, Horejs said.  BlackRock believes it has the expertise to make its push into retail alternatives successful, particularly because it already has a $100 billion alternatives business, Porcelli said.  The firm also has hired a team of seven alternative specialists to act as experts for its wholesalers.  He believes that investor interest in alternatives is not a passing fad.  “I think the traditional allocation of 60 percent stocks, 40 percent fixed income is a thing of the past,” he said. “We have been working on ‘the new diversification.’”  BlackRock’s push into retail alternative funds is part of its effort to double its U.S. mutual fund business aimed at retail investors to $600 billion by the end of 2014.  Since BlackRock bought Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in 2006, it has focused on getting more of its retail funds sold through the platforms of third-party broker-dealers other than Merrill Lynch, Porcelli said. The firm’s mutual fund penetration at broker-dealers other than Merrill has jumped to 5 percent from less than 1 percent in 2006. “We are in the top three or four (fund groups) at every firm we do business with,” Porcelli said.

This is not entirely new. The rise of absolute return products largely reflects intermediaries’ efforts to deal directly with client expectations that, for many, have taken a severe blow. It is worth looking back at the level of inflows to funds seeking absolute returns before and after 2008 (the nadir for the industry in terms of sales activity) to see how this has evolved.	   To view the chart, click here: r.reuters.com/xew24s  The data not only show the relative level of in- and out-flows for absolute return funds in Europe since 2005, but serves as a means to illustrate how activity has shifted in Europe.	   Up to the middle of 2007, investors in Italy, Switzerland and France were strong supporters of absolute return. However the failure of many of these funds through 2007-2008 sent investors running for the door. The best example of this is enhanced money market funds, primarily bought in France, where 31.6 billion euros of sales in 2005-2006 were followed by redemptions of 39 billion in 2007-2008 and essentially no activity since.	   As the fund sales trends suggest, many investors were less than impressed with their funds’ performance as the effects of the credit crisis rippled through the financial markets. By early 2008 the banking ombudsman in Lausanne had already received complaints about absolute return products.	   The previous year had seen the arrival of the Eligible Assets Directive (EAD), providing legally-binding guidance on which financial instruments could be included in cross-border Ucits funds, following the expansion of their investment capabilities with the implementation of Ucits III in 2003.	   The EAD looks to have served as a boost for absolute return fund sales since 2009 (especially when enhanced money market funds are excluded) closer to levels seen before 2008. But there has also been a shift in where investors are coming from, with the UK now dominating. 	   And just as many Continental European investors questioned the term “absolute return” previously, now similar questions are being asked in the UK. So it’s worth looking more closely at the numbers to see how these funds have really performed.	   To do this, we have looked back over the past five years and taken rolling 12-month returns as a reasonable benchmark against which to assess the absolute return funds universe across Europe.	   While there are now over 1,000 such funds that Lipper classifies as seeking absolute returns, this analysis generates 29,382 data points - rolling 12-month periods every month for a growing universe of funds over this five-year period to the end of August.	   Of this universe, 65.5 percent of the observations (19,245) saw positive returns generated.	   Fund companies and researchers have been looking at how to take this broad universe of absolute return funds and break it down into more comparable groups. BlackRock , for example, has been prominent in such moves (Fundweb, August 12, bit.ly/qrQMru).	   Lipper has adopted an approach along these lines for those absolute return funds that do not follow other hedge fund or alternative strategies. This has been developed in order to compare funds whose objectives are not primarily based on what they invest in (say, European equities), but on the positive returns they are aiming to achieve. What one might refer to as focusing on ‘output’ rather than ‘input’.	   This method breaks down absolute return funds by currency - reflecting the returns targeted by each fund - as well as by Value at Risk (VaR) to measure the risk associated with the absolute return strategy employed but without assuming normally distributed returns (as would be the case using standard deviation).	   Using this additional degree of granularity, we can focus on euro-denominated funds (which account for more than two thirds of the universe) and establish that the proportion of periods where positive returns were generated remains similar, at 64.2 percent.	   Segregating this universe further, the VaR quantiles reveal just how many similar funds have delivered widely differing proportions of positive returns. 	   To view the performance chart click: r.reuters.com/tew24s  While the VaR fund groupings are the more robust means to compare these funds, it is useful to explain the data shown in this chart in order to appreciate how successful absolute return funds have been overall.	   Nine percent of these funds (61 in all) have achieved a perfect record of delivering positive returns in every rolling 12-month period analysed. A further 28 percent have an impressive record of achieving positive returns at least 75 percent of the time. However, there is a sizeable middle ground of 40 percent of funds delivering positive returns between 50 and 74 percent of the time. 	   At the other end of the scale, extraordinarily, we found that 4 percent (24 funds) failed to deliver a positive return in any rolling 12-month period. Coupled to this, a further 19 percent of funds delivered losses more often than they delivered gains.	   So one can conclude that 37 percent of absolute return funds are doing a good job and delivering positive returns at least three quarters of the time, but 23 percent have been more likely to lose money over the course of a year than generate it.	   Using VaR classifications enables us to see that if one just looks at the one third of funds with the lowest risk, an improved picture can be found: 56 percent of this sub-group delivered positive returns at least three quarters of the time, while 15 percent have more often failed to deliver positive returns.	   For these products to grow further, the chasm that has opened up between expectations and reality must be narrowed for the rump of under-performing funds.	   Ultimately, and despite what the brochure might say, absolute return funds present the same problem that wealth managers, financial advisers and fund selectors face in assessing all actively managed funds - sorting the wheat from the chaff.  	   Those advising investors obviously play a pivotal role in this 'threshing' process, but the industry's farmers - fund companies themselves - also need to address investors' concerns.

142,BLK,BlackRock's Fink: risky equities a must investment,"TORONTO (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Laurence Fink said U.S. markets may now be more destabilized than they were during the 2008-09 crash, but advised investors to take on more risk nonetheless.  “I actually think the market is more destabilized now than in ‘08-09, because government can do less today than they could in ‘08-09,” he told reporters after a presentation in Toronto.  However, Fink, who said he does not believe the United States will fall into recession, said the low return on government bonds make investing in riskier assets such as equities a necessity.  “Earning two percent does not give the return to have the appropriate retirement,” he said.  “You’re going to have to take risk over a long period of time and do you really care if over a six-month period of time markets go up or down 15 percent?”  He said the stock market’s recent gyrations — major U.S. indices have moved in a range of nearly 10 percent over the past week — shows investors are taking a very short-term view, one that he does not share.  “We actually have put risk on the last few days,” he said.

144,BLK,UPDATE 1-BlackRock's Fink says don't ignore Wall St protests,"By Steven C. Johnson and Jennifer Ablan NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The chief executive of the world’s largest money manager said Thursday he welcomed the anti-Wall Street protests spreading around the country, saying they would help add balance to the debate on America’s future. “I believe we should not turn our backs on these protests,” said BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Laurence Fink at the Financial Times’ View from the Top conference in New York. “Maybe we will get some balance,” he added, noting that it would be helpful to have both right-leaning Tea Party members and the more left-leaning Wall Street protesters contribute to the national debate on economic issues. BlackRock is the world’s largest money manager with more than $3 trillion worth of assets under management. The Occupy Wall Street movement has sparked nationwide protests in more than 1,400 cities, according to Occupy Together, which has become an online hub for protest activity. Protesters are upset that the billions of dollars in bank bailouts doled out during the recession allowed banks to resume earning huge profits while average Americans have had no relief from high unemployment and job insecurity. The jobless rate has been at or above 9 percent since March and roughly 45 percent of the 14 million Americans without jobs have been unemployed for six months or more. Earlier on Thursday, Steven Rattner, a former adviser to the U.S. treasury secretary who led efforts to overhaul the U.S. auto industry, said healthy profits for U.S. companies have not trickled down to workers or the broader economy. Fink said having multiple voices involved in the debate is important, as the country faces serious challenges that will not soon fade away. “The two real engines of the economy over the last 10 to 20 years were consumer (spending) and housing,” he said, “and I don’t think those are going to come back any time soon.” Fink said it could take two to three years before those sectors recover. While he said the Federal Reserve has not been given enough credit for stepping in to stabilize the economy, he said the country now needs clarity and leadership from lawmakers. Earlier this week, the U.S. Senate defeated President Barack Obama’s $447 billion job-creation package, suggesting Washington is too paralyzed to take major steps to spur hiring before the 2012 elections. “We need to find our footing. It’s so much about leadership and clarity and we just haven’t found our footing as a country,” Fink said. He said the current sense of malaise infecting the country reminded him of the 1970s when the United States faced high unemployment and inflation. “We were really pessimistic about who we were in the 70s, but we showed resiliency many years ago. We should have the same capacity,” he said. But with jobs scarce, Fink warned that overly aggressive regulation of the financial industry could eventually drive firms in the United States as well as Britain and Europe to less costly bases in Singapore and Hong Kong. If firms find “that the cost of doing business in the UK, Europe and the U.S. rises, you’re going to see movement of people and trading activity” to other countries, Fink said.",10132011,http://www.reuters.com/article/wallstreet-protests-blackrock/update-1-blackrocks-fink-says-dont-ignore-wall-st-protests-idUSN1E79C20520111013

148,BLK,BlackRock irks rivals in push against riskier ETFs,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, called for regulators to flag riskier exchange-traded funds, a move being met with fierce opposition by rivals who dominate that niche. As U.S. regulators launch a broad review into the roughly $1 trillion ETF sector, a top BlackRock official told lawmakers on Wednesday that better disclosure rules are needed across the market, including its own huge ETF business. But the BlackRock official also urged regulators to adopt a new classification system that would strip the ETF label from more complex products largely offered by competitors — a proposal that some industry players characterized as self-serving. Noel Archard, a managing director at BlackRock in charge of product development for iShares, said leveraged or inverse ETFs are relative newcomers to the market that carry greater risk and may not be appropriate for many retail investors. BlackRock iShares, which has $538 billion in ETF assets and is the biggest provider in the United States, has no leveraged or inverse ETFs out of the 225 it offers in the United States. Four derivative-based funds it offers would be covered by BlackRock’s suggested new classifications. “Calling such products ETFs causes investor confusion and regulators should require a different label,” Archard said of leveraged and inverse ETFs at a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing examining risks in that market. A Securities and Exchange Commission official who testified at the hearing on Wednesday said BlackRock’s proposal deserves “serious consideration.” Other parts of the ETF industry, however, blasted BlackRock’s regulatory plan. Michael Sapir, chief executive of ProShares Advisors LLC, the largest provider of inverse and leveraged ETFs, accused BlackRock of using the hearing to “advocate its own agenda.” “It appears that they are trying to turn this hearing into a platform to really advance their own competitive interests rather than really talking about the real issues,” Sapir told Reuters in an interview. ProShares has $33 billion in total assets of which $27 billion is in leveraged and inverse ETFs. David Nadig, director of research at IndexUniverse.com, which focuses on ETFs, called BlackRock’s testimony “a bit self-serving” because the majority of iShares’ ETFs would not fall under the new classification it is calling for. “From BlackRock’s perspective, that would be just ducky because most of their product line wouldn’t fit into that definition,” Nadig said. Exchange-traded funds such as those managed by BlackRock, State Street and the Vanguard Group, generally track market indexes and trade on exchanges. They have grown to account for roughly $1 trillion in assets since their inception in the 1990s, and have some similarities to mutual funds in how they are structured and managed. Increased scrutiny of exchange-traded products has been fueled by ETFs’ performance during major market events like the May 6, 2010 “flash crash” and also by the recent proliferation of more complex exchange-traded products which some say may be confusing to average retail investors. SEC Investment Management Director Eileen Rominger told the hearing on Wednesday that the SEC has launched a broad, agency-wide review of exchange-traded funds. Rominger, a former Goldman Sachs investment officer, said the SEC is looking at investor disclosures, liquidity levels, fair valuations, and potential impact on volatility, among other issues. She did not reveal specific plans for new regulations, but she did give a nod toward BlackRock’s proposal. “I think that the classification system that Mr. Archard described is very interesting and deserves serious consideration,” Rominger told lawmakers. Many ETF providers and investment advisers say creating another acronym to distinguish complex ETFs from simpler ones will only cause more confusion. “Seven out of 10 investors don’t know what an ETF is,” said Tom Lydon, president of Global Trends Investments, an adviser managing $85 million. “This would just make it more complicated.” The short-term trading nature of these products does not mean they should be denied the ETF label, said Steven Baffico, chief executive of Four Wood Capital Partners, and former head of U.S. retail at Guggenheim Funds Distributors Inc. “It would seem to me that transparent, low-cost exposure to desired markets with ease of execution is really what ETFs were constructed to provide in the first place, isn’t it?” he said.

149,BLK,"BlackRock CEO says investors confused, fearful","(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Laurence Fink offered a sour outlook for investors on Wednesday, blaming recent market turmoil on inconsistent and poorly planned government actions in Europe. “Our investors are confused, our investors are asking quite (a few) questions right now,” Fink, who heads the world’s largest asset management firm, said on a conference call with analysts. Inconsistent government rescue efforts in Europe were stoking some of the fears. “With government not focused on the long term and with governments in many cases just doing the wrong thing, we have many clients worldwide who are confused, frozen, looking for answers,” Fink said. Fink’s comments, coming on his firm’s third-quarter earnings call, echoed the views of other top Wall Street players. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on Tuesday that uncertainty about government efforts had “amplified the level of concern” among investors. Fink was particularly critical of regulators’ move to nationalize European bank Dexia SA (DEXI.BR) just weeks after saying it had adequate capital. “This is just a glaring example of how government has really unsettled the marketplace,” Fink said. If governments acted with “a sensible longer-term view,” Fink said investors “would rush right back into the marketplace.” The confusion, following brutal performance for equity markets in the third quarter, was slowing investment decisions and prompting a move to less risky assets, he said. The shares of New York-based BlackRock, the world's largest money manager by assets, were down 3.9 percent at $150.15 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Tuesday, the shares had fallen 18 percent this year, compared with a 2 percent decline in the S&P; 500 index .SPX. During the third quarter, BlackRock customers withdrew a net $10.2 billion, more than some analysts expected. That included a single withdrawal of $9.1 billion from indexed fixed-income accounts. And the firm said a single fixed-income customer intends to withdraw $36 billion so it can manage a similar indexed account in-house. Offsetting the expected loss, BlackRock said it won about $65 billion of new business that had not been deposited yet. The market turmoil did not hurt BlackRock’s bottom line much in the quarter. Third-quarter earnings totaled $595 million, or $3.23 a share, up from $551 million, or $2.83 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax benefit, costs for exiting leases and some compensation plans, the firm earned $2.83 per share. On that basis, analysts on average expected $2.63, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fink highlighted the firm’s 40.1 percent adjusted profit margin, up from 38.4 percent a year earlier, achieved by keeping expenses in check. While revenue increased 6.4 percent to $2.2 billion, expenses grew 4.5 percent to $1.4 billion. BlackRock, partially owned by PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) and Barclays Plc (BARC.L), benefited from its market-leading iShares line-up of exchange-traded funds, which took in $10.8 billion in the third quarter. Hit by the quarter’s turbulent markets, assets under management at BlackRock totaled $3.345 trillion, down 9 percent during the quarter and down 3 percent from a year earlier. Fink touched on a hearing being held in Washington on Wednesday about ETF regulation. BlackRock is urging that ETF sponsors provide greater clarity and transparency about fund holdings, he said.

151,BLK,U.S. SEC conducting sweeping regulatory review of ETFs,"* SEC conducting broad review of exchange-traded funds * Review to look at transparency; market volatility * BlackRock calls for better ETF disclosures for investors By Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a broad, agency-wide review of exchange-traded funds to ensure they are adequately transparent and not fueling market volatility, a top agency official told lawmakers on Wednesday. “Commission staff is currently engaged in a general review of exchange-traded products in connection with, among others, the adequacy of investor disclosure, liquidity levels and transparency of underlying instruments in which ETPs invest, fair valuations, efficiency in the arbitrage process and the relationship between market volatility and ETPs,” SEC Investment Management Director Eileen Rominger said in prepared testimony. The review also entails “gathering and analyzing detailed information about specific products,” she said. The news of the SEC’s general review of exchange-traded funds came at a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing on Wednesday that was called to examine potential regulatory issues arising from ETFs, which have attracted more SEC scrutiny in the past several years. It also marks the second investment company-related review that the SEC has undertaken, after the agency voted in late August to seek comments from the public on the potential risks of derivatives use by mutual funds, ETFs and other similarly structured funds. Exchange-traded funds such as those managed by BlackRock , State Street and the Vanguard Group, generally track market indexes and trade on exchanges. They have grown to account for roughly $1 trillion in assets since their inception in the 1990s, and have some similarities to mutual funds in how they are structured and managed. In recent years, however, certain kinds of ETFs and major market events such as the May 6, 2010, “flash crash” have raised concerns by regulators that they may be contributing to market volatility or pose risks to less savvy investors. During the flash crash, for instance, ETFs experienced massive intraday price swings and made up 70 percent of all canceled trades. The event led the SEC and the exchanges to implement circuit breakers to help prevent another major market drop. Then earlier this year, 10 new exchange-traded funds suffered a mini “flash crash,” forcing Nasdaq OMX to cancel trades. The SEC has also been closely looking at leveraged ETFs, which can be used to magnify returns, and inverse ETFs, which deliver the opposite of the performance of the underlying benchmark index. The SEC, along with other regulators, has issued warnings to investors about the risks surrounding these kinds of ETFs, especially because many of them reset on a daily basis, making it harder to judge long-term performance. Back in March 2010, the agency also suspended all exemptive requests from exchange-traded funds seeking to invest heavily in derivatives pending the outcome of its review into derivatives use by investment companies. Public comments on that issue are being accepted until Nov. 7. Noel Archard, a managing director at BlackRock in charge of product development for iShares, plans to tell lawmakers on Wednesday that there needs to be better disclosures and descriptions of ETFS for investors. For instance, he said, any inverse, leveraged or derivatives-based funds should not be labeled as ETFs. He also is calling for better disclosure of financial holdings and fund fees. “Clear labeling combined with disclosure of fees and risks is a critical starting point to achieving the better clarity investors need to understand various structures,” he said.",10192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/sec-etfs/u-s-sec-conducting-sweeping-regulatory-review-of-etfs-idUSN1E79I0CK20111019

155,BLK,BlackRock says steeper European writedowns needed,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - European policymakers need to take four decisive steps to end the euro zone crisis, including debt restructuring in Greece, Portugal and Ireland with writedowns for private creditors of 75 percent to 80 percent, said the BlackRock Investment Institute. “Governments are falling, bond yields are zig-zagging by whole percentage points and markets around the world are locking up: the euro zone turmoil risks turning into a global crisis,” BlackRock said in a research note on Monday. The institute, part of BlackRock Inc, one of the world’s largest asset managers, said the European summit on October 26 was short on details, with more clarity and bolder steps needed. Along with the writedowns, the note recommended more bond buying, details on the European Financial Stability Fund’s (EFSF) funding and how it will support markets and credible fiscal policies that deliver long-term savings over reactionary, short-term cuts. Private creditors should write off 75 percent to 80 percent of Greek debt to allow for permanent stability, the note said, with holders of Irish and Portuguese debt in line for similar cuts. Banks should be forced to take the losses as opposed to a voluntary program which is unlikely to be successful. Global equities still look attractive due to solid earnings growth and dividend payouts exceeding bond yields in developed markets, the firm noted. But that may change if Europe succumbs to a deep or lengthy recession and highlights the need for policymakers to “set and implement credible, decisive and thoughtful rules.” ",11142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-markets-stocks-blackrock/blackrock-says-steeper-european-writedowns-needed-idUSTRE7AD1FC20111114
156,BLK,UPDATE 2-BofA reaches settlement in Countrywide case,"*Terms of the settlement were not disclosed *Investors included BlackRock and CalPERs By Rick Rothacker Nov 22 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp has reached a settlement with former Countrywide Financial Corp institutional investors who decided not to join a $624 million class-action case that won court approval in February. The terms of the accord were not disclosed in a filing in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that was dated Monday. Countrywide’s former auditor KPMG was not part of the pact, according to the filing. Blackrock Inc , the California Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and other investors in July filed a lawsuit that alleged Countrywide and its top leaders perpetrated fraud “in a quest to triple Countrywide’s market share and enrich themselves at the expense” of investors. Bank of America acquired the former subprime lender on July 1, 2008. Bank of America spokeswoman Shirley Norton declined to comment. CalPERS spokesman Wayne Davis said the pension fund was pleased with the agreement. Blackrock could not immediately be reached. Since buying Countrywide, the second-largest U.S. bank has been besieged with lawsuits related to questionable loans and mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide during the housing boom. The $624 million pact was one of the largest class-action settlements to emerge from the financial crisis. Bank of America’s shares fell 2.2 percent to $5.37 amid concerns of renewed regulatory constraints on the bank. The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that regulators told Bank of America’s board in recent months that they want to see more progress in complying with a 2009 memorandum of understanding requiring the bank to fix governance, risk and liquidity management issues. The bank could face a public enforcement action if it doesn’t satisfy regulators, the paper said. Bank of America, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency declined comment.",11222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/bankofamerica-settlement/update-2-bofa-reaches-settlement-in-countrywide-case-idUSN1E7AL1O520111122

158,BLK,BlackRock reorganizes marketing; cuts jobs,"*Layoffs seen as way to cut costs *Reorg comes amidst push targeting retail advisers By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) -BlackRock Inc is reorganizing its marketing division, resulting in layoffs, according to people familiar with the situation. Job cuts have come in the retail marketing division, which targets financial advisers, according to one person who had received calls from eight people about the layoffs in the past few weeks. Four of those people had been BlackRock marketers who were let go, the person said. It was not immediately clear if layoffs and reorganizing were occuring in other divisions. It could not be determined how many people in total were being let go. Bobbie Collins, a BlackRock spokeswoman, confirmed that there has been some reorganization and layoffs as a result of challenging market and economic conditions. “In particular, we are focusing resources on key priorities, while identifying ways to streamline processes, simplify platforms, and reduce expenses,” Collins wrote in an e-mailed statement. “This has included shifting personnel in some instances and in some cases eliminating positions consistent with client needs.” She declined to elaborate on what divisions were being reorganized or how many employees were being let go. The reorganization comes just eight months after the firm announced it hoped to double its U.S. mutual fund business aimed at retail investors to $600 billion by the end of 2014. At that time, Frank Porcelli, managing director and head of U.S. retail, told Reuters that he was increasing its staff serving retail advisers by 15 percent. But BlackRock, like many U.S.-based asset managers, has been hit by net outflows due to the volatile markets. During the third quarter, investors withdrew a net $10.2 billion, more than some analysts expected. As of the end of the third quarter, assets under management at BlackRock totaled $3.345 trillion, down 9 percent during the quarter and down 3 percent from a year earlier. “BlackRock ramped up its marketing and sales tremendously this year, so this appears to be a bit of the hangover,” said recruiter who heard about the layoffs. The reorganization at BlackRock shows how difficult it is for firms with a strong institutional presence to gain traction in the retail space, said Geoff Bobroff, a mutual fund consultant. “Clearly BlackRock has a retail presence with its iShares business, but it is not the traditional retail fund family,” Bobroff said. “That makes it harder to gain flows.” ",11302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock/blackrock-reorganizes-marketing-cuts-jobs-idUSN1E7AT1IK20111130
159,BLK,BlackRock investment executives exit,"* Firm trims underperforming areas, sources say * One 22-year veteran retires By Jessica Toonkel Dec 1 (Reuters) -A number of investment management executives at BlackRock Inc. have left the $3.345 trillion asset management firm over the past few weeks. Many of the departures are part of an effort to shed weight in underperforming areas, sources familiar with the situation said. Steve Switzky, managing director of the fixed income group, left BlackRock in early November. He had been with BlackRock since 1994, according to Morningstar. A call to Switzky’s home was not returned. Separately, Richard Shea and Chris Milner, president and managing director of BlackRock’s real estate debt company, Anthracite Capital, will leave the firm today. Their departures, first reported by Debtwire, come 18 months after Anthracite filed for bankruptcy. In April, in a bid to revive the business, BlackRock hired Jack Chandler, a global chief investment officer and executive chairman for Asia for LaSalle Investment Management, as its new global head of real estate. BlackRock said in an internal e-mail on Tuesday that Mike Lustig, a 20-year veteran of the firm, would retire. Lustig, a managing director and part of the BlackRock’s financial modeling portfolio analytics group, had accepted a teaching job at Columbia University’s business school, according to the e-mail from BlackRock Inc. President Robert Kapito, which was obtained by Reuters. Lustig was not available for comment. BlackRock recently also made changes in its retail marketing division, which targets financial advisers. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that BlackRock had trimmed jobs in that division as part of firm-wide cost-cutting measures spurred by challenging market conditions. “In particular, we are focusing resources on key priorities, while identifying ways to streamline processes, simplify platforms, and reduce expenses,” BlackRock spokeswoman Bobbie Collins wrote in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday. “This has included shifting personnel in some instances, and in some cases, eliminating positions consistent with client needs.” It’s not uncommon to see year-end departures at investment management companies as some executives retire, while others are asked to leave due to underperformance, said Joseph McCabe, vice chairman at recruiting firm CTPartners. And BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is known for trimming underperformers. Jay Alexander, who ran the firm’s Granite Fund for institutional real estate investors, departed this summer after his fund lost more than 50 percent of its value in two years. In 2008, the firm cut a half dozen members of a lagging equity growth unit amid widespread cost cutting. A few years earlier, Fink let go several stock-picking teams with market-lagging records acquired in a deal for MetLife’s State Street Research & Management division.",12012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-departures/blackrock-investment-executives-exit-idUSN1E7B00N820111201
160,BLK,BlackRock bond crossing network coming in 2012,"(Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is almost ready to open an internal bond trading platform for its clients, president Rob Kapito said on Wednesday. The new crossing network, expected to be available in early 2012, will allow clients with $10 trillion of assets on BlackRock’s Aladdin risk management and tracking platform to make trades with each other and the firm’s $3.3 trillion of funds, Kapito said in a speech at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference in New York. BlackRock has been saying for the past year that it planned to offer clients an internal trading network to lower transaction costs and reduce the risk of word leaking about planned moves. BlackRock’s iShares line of exchange-traded funds is benefitting from concerns in Europe about competitors’ ETFs that rely on derivatives, Kapito also said. BlackRock’s funds typically own actual securities while some competing products offered by European banks rely on total return swaps. “There’s a flight to the physical underlying ETFs driving significant market share,” Kapito said at the conference. BlackRock had net inflow of over $15 billion so far this year in its non-U.S. ETFs, he said. The firm’s funds are capturing about 80 percent of the net new ETF business in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, he said. Shares of New York-based BlackRock ended 0.5 percent higher at $174.37 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The shares have lost almost 9 percent so far this year.

161,BLK,Blackrock sees opportunities as miners chase cash,"LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - A shortage of financing for small- and mid-cap miners from banks reluctant to lend, is providing “huge” opportunities for BlackRock Inc to invest in resources and reap high returns, the world’s largest money manager said on Wednesday. Evy Hambro, BlackRock’s investment chief for natural resources, said there was an “incredibly acute” funding squeeze for single-project miners or miners in the late development and early production stage, as banks were simply refusing to lend. Smaller miners or those with projects not yet in production typically struggle to secure cash in a downturn, but the squeeze has been particularly tough as an under-pressure banking system builds up capital buffers to defend against deteriorating market conditions. The IPO market has also dried up, closing another potential avenue of accessing financing. Hambro said many of these miners have been tapping BlackRock for capital, which the fund manager is turning into an opportunity to improve returns. “There is this big reluctance by the banks to provide capital to those companies and if they are prepared to provide capital, it’s on very onerous (terms),” Hambro told reporters. “We are going to give them that capital, we are going to help these companies to grow, but we are going to charge a lot more for that capital, simply because that capital is much more valuable right now.” Hambro said his fund had the freedom under its mandate to invest not just in equity but in corporate debt, ordinary bonds, loans and even in private companies and royalties. “It’s exactly the same as we were doing in 2009 when companies were looking to finance themselves ... We saw a huge amount of convertible debt issues and we were a big buyer of that debt,” he said. BlackRock has already been providing backing in this vein to companies like AIM-listed iron ore miner African Minerals , which borrowed almost $420 million at the start of this year to fund its flagship Tonkolili project. Tonkolili loaded its first iron ore shipment last month. Hambro said one outcome of the financing squeeze would be increased M&A; — banks may be pulling back on loans to small operations but they continue to lend to the large players. Weaker equity markets that have brought down valuations and optimistic long-term outlooks have all added to a potentially rosier background for deals. BlackRock said the traditional buy-versus-build debate — one miners have when considering how to add to or renew their asset base — was moving increasingly against making investments in building projects from scratch. “In my mind, equities today are a far cheaper way of growing your business than reinvesting into new assets, and with far (less) risk,” Hambro said. “There is the prospect for considerable levels of M&A; across the mining space.” The sector has long been waiting for an acquisitions boom as a result of weaker share prices. So far, a significant wave has failed to materialise but there are signs of more deals on the way, with Polish copper miner KGHM agreeing to buy Canada-based Quadra FNX for $3 billion on Tuesday and European Goldfields announcing it has received approaches. Regardless of deals, however, big miners, with cash on their balance sheets, are facing pressure to return more to shareholders.  Precious metals miners, for example, have typically seen payout ratios above 30 percent over the last decade — they are currently roughly half that. “Mining businesses always need to invest in that asset base ... but you need to balance that reinvestment with shareholder returns. The trouble is that balance has been totally out of kilter with the past,” Hambro said, adding companies were already recognising this. “Shareholders are complaining.”",12072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-mining/blackrock-sees-opportunities-as-miners-chase-cash-idUSL5E7N735P20111207

BlackRock declined to comment about further job losses in other regions but confirmed that 59 staff based in its San Francisco office were also being made redundant, although not necessarily from its iShares unit.

BlackRock said on Wednesday its holding in the Italian bank stood at 3.09 percent, retracting an earlier statement which said it had cut its stake to 1.71 percent just days before the launch of UniCredit’s 7.5 billion euro ($9.6 billion) rights issue. “We are making checks on this,” the source said. “BlackRock says they made a mistake, but there is a capital increase underway, it’s a systemically important financial institution and a European blue chip — so we have to look into this,” the source added. On January 2, Consob said it had been notified by BlackRock of a stake reduction to 1.7 percent from 4 percent. In its statement on Wednesday, BlackRock said: “This change in holding was generated as a result of a corporate action, not through a reduction in holdings in UniCredit by BlackRock. BlackRock’s aggregated holding in UniCredit Spa remained unchanged and as of the 28th of December 2011 ... was at 3.09 percent. “The notification therefore should not have been issued.” Blackrock said it had issued a retraction of the notification to Consob and UniCredit on January 6.

Canadian ETFs overall had net inflows of C$1.5 billion in January, according to a monthly report from the Canadian ETF arm of New York-based BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager. ETFs are investment vehicles that own an array of stocks, similar to mutual funds, but have shares that are traded on public exchanges. Strong stock market performance and continued demand for fixed income boosted ETF assets under management. Fixed income captured C$880 million of the net inflows in January, driven largely by demand for yield through corporate bonds. Equity ETFs attracted C$482 million in net inflows. “Fixed income still remains very popular, continuing the trend of the last half of 2011,” BlackRock said in a statement. Low fees and greater transparency have helped ETFs attract strong investment inflows in recent years. Unlike mutual fund shares, which are re-priced once a day, the price of an ETF is publicly quoted and visible throughout the day. BlackRock’s Canadian iShares business had a market share of  66.6 percent in November, with assets under management of C$30.2 billion. Claymore Investments had a 15.7 percent market share, with ETF assets in Canada of C$7.1 billion. BlackRock’s iShares unit snapped up privately held Claymore Investments last month. The takeover of the No. 2 ETF player by the No. 1 boosted iShares’ share of the Canadian ETF market to about 82 percent, according to Friday’s data. Bank of Montreal’s ETF assets rose to C$4.1 billion, while Horizon ETF assets edged up to C$3.2 billion.

173,BLK,BlackRock CEO Fink says equities are still cheap,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Chairman and CEO Laurence Fink said on Wednesday he still believes U.S. equities are attractive even with their solid rise so far this year. “We still have a long ways to go to make equities look expensive,” Fink, who heads the $3.51 trillion asset management firm BlackRock (BLK.N), told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations. The benchmark S&P; 500 index .SPX - which closed above the May 2011 intraday high of 1,370.58 on Tuesday - is up more than 9 percent this year. Risk has made a huge comeback this year on signs of improvement in the U.S. economy, including job growth, manufacturing and consumer confidence, as well as an attractive risk-reward ratio on equities relative to other asset classes. Fink, who spoke at CFR as part of a CEO Speaker Series, said dividend-paying stocks, multinationals and investment-grade-rated corporate bonds should be a part of investors’ portfolios. Asked on the sidelines about the housing market and investor activity, Fink told Reuters: “You are starting to see the speculative fervor come in as we start bottoming out. But we have another 1-1/2 years of indigestion. We still have excess homes.” Hedge funds, private equity firms and other deep-pocketed investors are looking to scoop up foreclosed homes and earn money by renting them out. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, last year received proposals from hundreds of investment groups interested in acquiring and renting out single-family homes federal agencies have foreclosed on. Fink also addressed China’s economy, saying “I don’t think China is slowing down in 2012” and that China is easing, which will help to re-stimulate the economy. He also praised the present leadership in China. Fink said that the European Central Bank’s long-term refinancing operation is solving many problems but that Europe remains vulnerable without fundamental growth.

Fink, who spoke at CFR as part of a CEO Speaker Series, said dividend-paying stocks, multinationals and investment-grade-rated corporate bonds should be a part of investors’ portfolios. Asked on the sidelines about the housing market and investor activity, Fink told Reuters: “You are starting to see the speculative fervor come in as we start bottoming out. But we have another 1-1/2 years of indigestion. We still have excess homes.” Hedge funds, private equity firms and other deep-pocketed investors are looking to scoop up foreclosed homes and earn money by renting them out. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, last year received proposals from hundreds of investment groups interested in acquiring and renting out single-family homes federal agencies have foreclosed on. Fink also addressed China’s economy, saying “I don’t think China is slowing down in 2012” and that China is easing, which will help to re-stimulate the economy. He also praised the present leadership in China. Fink said that the European Central Bank’s long-term refinancing operation is solving many problems but that Europe remains vulnerable without fundamental growth.",2292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/funds-blackrock/update-1-blackrocks-fink-says-equities-are-still-cheap-idUSL2E8DT4WL20120229

176,BLK,Floating price won't destroy money funds: BlackRock,"(Reuters) - The $2.7 trillion U.S. money market mutual fund industry could survive in a smaller form if regulators insist on floating share prices, a senior BlackRock Inc official said. “We think there will be some shrinkage, but we don’t think it would eliminate the product,” Barbara Novick, vice chairman of BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, told Bloomberg News in an interview on Friday. The statement comes as regulators are considering several proposals to reform money market funds, which needed government backing during the recent credit crisis. Such backing can no longer be offered. Under one plan, money market funds would give up their fixed price of $1 per share, and share prices would vary like those of other types of mutual funds. Under another proposal, the $1 share price would remain but the funds would have to set aside capital to cover losses, and investors would not be permitted to withdraw all their money at once.

Catherine Raw, the co-fund manager of the BlackRock World Mining Fund and a member of a team that manages $39.9 billion in assets, said the group had reduced its weighting of BHP to 6.5 percent from as high as 10 percent, the report said.

181,BLK,BlackRock calls for action on conflicts of interest in ETFs,"* Says regulators need to go further on conflicts of interest * Deadline for responses to ESMA proposals March 30 * Focus on securities lending misplaced By Anjuli Davies LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - Regulators in Europe are not going far enough in addressing conflicts of interest that arise in the ETF industry, when providers are also owned by banks, BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager and ETF provider, said on Friday. In Europe providers of exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) - open-ended funds that can be bought and sold like shares on a stock exchange - are divided between asset managers like BlackRock’s iShares, specialist providers like Source and investment banks like Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank, who own ETF arms Lyxor and db x-trackers. There are also two different index-tracking methods: physical ETFs, which take in baskets of the underlying assets tracked by the index, and so-called synthetic ETFs, which aim to  replicate returns through the use of derivatives. In Europe about 40 percent of ETF assets are based on synthetic products, BlackRock estimates. BlackRock believes potential conflicts of interests arise when a synthetic ETF provider enters into a derivative agreement with its investment banking parent, because the costs it pays for the swap could be uncompetitive and beneficial to the bank. “If you have a single counterparty that is your affiliate there is not really the same incentive to ensure that the swap spread is competitive, and that represents a potential conflict of interest,” Tim Lubans, director of legal and compliance at BlackRock told journalists at a briefing. In response to guidelines published in January for consultation by Europe’s market watchdog, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), BlackRock advocates that alongside greater transparency, regulators should restrict ETF providers from only using one counterparty that is affiliated to a parent company and instead should be forced to use multiple counterparties. Increased scrutiny of the 1.7 trillion dollar industry has been fueled by ETFs’ performance during major market events like the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”, along with warnings by international watchdogs and by the recent proliferation of more complex exchange-traded products which some say may be confusing to average retail investors. Regulatory scrutiny has also focused on the wider debate surrounding physical versus synthetic ETFs in Europe. Synthetic providers worried that the new ESMA proposals might undermine their products by reclassifying them as “complex”, following warnings last year from international watchdogs that the use of derivatives could expose investors to collateral and counterparty risk. But physical ETFs have also been criticised for potential counterparty risks from providers engaging in securities lending, in which the fund lends out securities to outside investors in exchange for collateral and a fee. Under the ESMA’s proposals, ETF providers would be required to disclose if they make use of securities lending, along with specific criteria and disclosure requirements about the quality and diversification of collateral posted. BlackRock’s iShares reports its securities lending operations on a daily basis on its website where investors can also see the underlying collateral holdings for each Dublin-domiciled fund. It also states that 40 percent of the revenue earned goes to BlackRock, while 60 percent is returned to investors. But while BlackRock says it welcomes the scrutiny by regulators, it argued they should focus on the quality of collateral posted when securities are lent out rather than any new diversification rules. The ESMA wants to implement any proposed changes this year with the deadline for responses March 30, but BlackRock says at least 12 months would be needed to bring the guidelines into effect. Preliminary estimates suggest record ETF inflows of 60 billion dollars globally at the start of this year, says BlackRock.",3302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/financial-etfs-regulation/blackrock-calls-for-action-on-conflicts-of-interest-in-etfs-idUSL6E8EU2YJ20120330
182,BLK,BlackRock ramps up global EM debt team,"LONDON, April 3 (IFR) - BlackRock has poached seven emerging markets fund managers from BNP Paribas Investment Partners to ramp up its global efforts in the asset class. The hires include Sergio Trigo Paz, who was chief investment officer of BNP’s emerging markets fixed income business, to head BlackRock’s efforts. Imran Hussain, who has been running the firm’s emerging markets fixed income business, will leave after a transition period. Peter Fisher, senior managing director and global head of fixed income at BlackRock said the hires complement last year’s  appointment of Joel Kim from ING Investment Management as head of Asia-Pacific fixed income. “We were punching below our weight principally in terms of assets but also the size of our emerging markets team,” said Fisher in explaining the hires. BlackRock has about USD4bn of assets under management through exclusive emerging markets mandates. He added: “We’ve been building our emerging markets capabilities and this is the next step.” Trigo Paz and the team will be based in London where their remit will be to invest in hard currency, local currency and corporate emerging markets assets across the globe. “They are one of the leading teams out there,” said Fisher. “I like they way they complement our other fixed income processes.” Fisher added that Trigo Paz and Kim will decide on how the business develops, including whether to hire portfolio managers based in Latin America. As well as Trigo Paz the other hires are Raphael Marechal, Chris Kelly, Laurent Develay, Michel Aubenas, Jane Yu and Ernesto Bettoni. The team managed about USD6bn of assets at BNPP.

184,BLK,European equity ETPs buck trend with Q1 outflows,"* Record start to the year for global ETPs * European equity products buck trend with outflows * Fixed income and emerging markets see strong start By Anjuli Davies LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Investors withdrew $600 million of cash from European equity exchange traded products (ETPs) in the first three months of 2012, bucking a global trend of record first quarter inflows into the sector, data from BlackRock showed on Wednesday. Exchange-traded products (ETPs) is an umbrella term that covers exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and others. ETFs trade like a share, and track an index, either by holding the underlying assets, or by synthetically replicating the returns using derivatives. In the first quarter of the year, the industry pulled in $67.3 billion of net new assets, an increase of 57 percent year-on-year, marking the best annual start on record, Blackrock estimated. But demand for ETPs based on European equities continued to fall, after net redemptions at the end of last year, in contrast to the average inflows of $5.3 billion a quarter in 2011. “Despite improvements in the global economic outlook, there is still a degree of volatility and uncertainty around issues such as the euro zone and oil prices, which will continue to colour investor sentiment in the months to come,” Jennifer Grancio, managing director at BlackRock said. In contrast, emerging market equity ETPs saw their best start to the year on record taking $13.7 billion in new money, while North American equity ETPs saw robust inflows of over $22.7 billion accounting for 29 percent of total ETP inflows. Fixed income was another beneficiary, pulling in $19.5 billion of new money in the first quarter, also a new high.  Within that space, though, there were marked differences with investment grade and high-yield corporate debt accounting for 85 percent of all inflows. Government bond products, by contrast, saw outflows of $1.5 billion over the quarter. Investors have also flocked to products that bet on or hedge against volatility, whose wild fluctuations over recent months have prompted an investigation by U.S. regulator, FINRA . Globally, ETP assets under management hit around $1.7 trillion at the end of March, with overall growth of $200 billion including new money and favourable market and exchange rate movements.",4042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/etps-data/european-equity-etps-buck-trend-with-q1-outflows-idUSL6E8F44QB20120404
185,BLK,BlackRock first-quarter profit steady as ETFs draw billions,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, said first-quarter profits were steady, bolstered by strong inflows into its popular iShares exchange-traded fund business. But despite the inflows and booming equity markets during the first quarter, revenue at New York-based BlackRock declined $33 million, or 1 percent, to $2.2 billion, the firm said on Wednesday. Investors continued to favor the firm’s indexed funds over actively managed accounts, which typically generate higher fees, though not necessarily higher profit margins. Shares of BlackRock fell 2.9 percent to $196.01 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 10 percent this year, matching the 10 percent gain in the S&P; 500 index .SPX. Investors were somewhat disappointed with Chief Executive Laurence Fink’s “tepid outlook” for flows into higher-fee equity funds for the rest of the year, Mac Sykes, an analyst at Gabelli & Co, said. Extra spending required to meet regulatory mandates and other demands could also reduce profit margins, Sykes said. While investors have begun to move some assets from cash and short-term bonds to equities and longer-term debt, a shift known as “de-risking,” there has yet been no “major shift” in investor attitudes, CEO Fink said on a call with analysts. Many investors remain more fearful about potential problems in Europe than hopeful that the issues have been resolved, he explained. “I would still qualify the market to be quite fragile,” Fink said. Fink kept a tight hand on expenses during the quarter. Even as BlackRock rolled out a new global ad campaign around the slogan “Investing for a New World,” Fink cut operating expenses by $50 million, or 3 percent, to $1.4 billion on lower office occupancy, fund and compensation costs. Net income increased to $572 million, or $3.14 per share, from $568 million, or $2.89 per share, in the same quarter a year before. Assets under management at BlackRock totaled $3.68 trillion, up 5 percent during the quarter and 1 percent from a year earlier. Customers withdrew a net $10.3 billion from long-term funds; but excluding a single, previously announced withdrawal of $36 billion from an indexed fixed income account, BlackRock said it had inflow of $25.7 billion. Just in iShares alone, customers added a net $18.2 billion, a 74 percent increase from the same quarter last year. Over half the total went into bond ETFs. The flows reflected a preference for BlackRock’s indexed offerings. For example, investors added $7.4 billion to stock index funds and withdrew $4.5 billion from active stock funds. BlackRock, which is partially owned by PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) and Barclays Plc (BARC.L), also offered an update about its plan to open a private trading platform for bonds which was first discussed in 2010. The system, which has not been approved by regulators yet, is related to the firm’s Aladdin risk management service which covers $10 trillion of assets. It would let BlackRock customers who use the risk management service trade bonds among themselves and with BlackRock fund managers, bypassing Wall Street dealers. The trading platform would help users reduce the cost of buying and selling bonds if Wall Street firms cut back on their participation in the market because of new regulations like the Volcker rule, which limits proprietary trading, CEO Fink said. If Wall Street steps back, as many expect, the bid/ask spreads to trade bonds could widen, Fink explained. If the problem does not materialize, BlackRock’s new trading platform will not be needed, he added. “If we could see a narrowing in bid/ask spreads, we don’t need the Aladdin trading platform,” Fink said. BlackRock’s profit per share increased 9 percent in the first quarter even as net income rose less than 1 percent. BlackRock’s number of fully diluted shares outstanding declined to 182 million from 194 million a year earlier. Excluding the costs of some compensation plans and some other expenses, the firm earned $3.16 per share. On that basis, analysts on average had expected $3.04, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

186,BLK,BlackRock targets consumers in slowing China,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - China’s 1.3 billion consumers may be the only thing preventing the world’s second-largest economy from a hard landing that could reverberate across global markets, according to a report issued by asset manager BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) on Tuesday. The Chinese economy is transitioning from production and exports to building a strong middle class that could support future growth. That shift is likely to end the country’s run of double-digit economic gains, leading to further volatility in global stock markets, BlackRock managers said. “Most economies slow when they move from production to consumption,” said Ewen Cameron Watt, chief investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute. Investors who continue to bet on hard commodities and infrastructure could be especially burned by the shift, Watt said. Basic materials companies will likely suffer as China slows its commodity consumption, leading to drops in pr o fits and share prices for Australian, Canadian and British companies that have supplied much of China’s raw materials. China faces other issues, too. Property values are widely considered to be inflated, bank regulations meant to curb excessive lending are loosely enforced and seven of the nine members of the elite Politburo Standing Committee, often seen as the power brokers of the national government, will be replaced in the fall. That might seem to leave little to invest in. But BlackRock and others are targeting the millions of Chinese consumers who can purchase basic goods — refrigerators and ovens — for the first time. That means putting money into companies such as China Mobile Ltd (0941.HK) and Shanghai Industrial Holdings Ltd (0363.HK) that provide basics such as cell phone service, tobacco and paper and packaging materials. It is a strategy that is becoming popular with fund managers and analysts. Edmund Harriss, manager of the $171 million Guinness Atkinson China and Hong Kong fund (ICHKX.O), has been moving his portfolio deeper into Chinese companies that provide consumer goods. Paul Dietrich, head of global research at Middleburg, Virgina-based Washington Wealth Management, says China’s consumers “are the next big growth area.” “Over the next decade, it’s the boring, Warren Buffett-type companies that are going to do exceedingly well,” he said. In large part, that is a reflection of demographic change. Economists at Deutsche Bank estimate that, by 2015, about half of China’s households will have an income whose purchasing power is equivalent to someone living in Mississippi - about $29,000. In 2010, only about 15 percent of Chinese households boasted the same level of income. Jeff Shen, who heads BlackRock’s emerging market equity group, said investors should look to multinational companies that make consumer goods. Luxury goods, in particular, are expected to continue to perform well. Tiffany and Co (TIF.N), for example, is expected to make 18 percent of its global sales from China, while Coach COH.N and Burberry (BRBY.L) are expected to see between 6 and 10 percent of total sales come from the country. Burberry Group Plc (BRBY.L)and Coach Inc COH.N have performed particularly well already in 2012. The shares of each company are up more than 20 percent. Investors could also benefit by targeting domestic Chinese companies, Shen said. In the fund he manages, the $85 million BlackRock Emerging Market Long/Short Fund (BLSAX.O), Shen owns China Mobile and is shorting export-focused companies such as China Shipping Container Lines Co Ltd (601866.SS) “Valuations have come down quite a lot over the 18 months and look a lot more attractive today,” he said. It is generally easier for a U.S.-based investor to hold Chinese stocks through an ETF or fund. The $905 million SPDR S&P; China ETF (GXC.P), for instance, holds Chinese companies that are listed in Hong Kong or New York. The fund, which Morningstar named as its pick for broad exposure to the Chinese stock market, holds 165 long positions in stocks. It costs 59 cents per $100 invested and yields 1.9 percent. China Mobile (0941.HK), China Construction Bank Corp (601939.SS) and Internet search company Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) are its top holdings, with about 20 percent of assets. BlackRock reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Excluding the costs of some compensation plans and some other expenses, the firm earned $3.16 per share. On that basis, analysts on average had expected $3.04, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said its profits were bolstered by strong inflows into its popular iShares ETF business.

194,BLK,HOW TO PLAY IT-BlackRock targets consumers in slowing China,"NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - China’s 1.3 billion consumers may be the only thing preventing the world’s second-largest economy from a hard landing that could reverberate across global markets, according to a report issued by asset manager BlackRock Inc on Tuesday. The Chinese economy is transitioning from production and exports to building a strong middle class that could support future growth. That shift is likely to end the country’s run of double-digit economic gains, leading to further volatility in global stock markets, BlackRock managers said. “Most economies slow when they move from production to consumption,” said Ewen Cameron Watt, chief investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute. Investors who continue to bet on hard commodities and infrastructure could be especially burned by the shift, Watt said. Basic materials companies will likely suffer as China slows its commodity consumption, leading to drops in pr o fits and share prices for Australian, Canadian and British companies that have supplied much of China’s raw materials. China faces other issues, too. Property values are widely considered to be inflated, bank regulations meant to curb excessive lending are loosely enforced and seven of the nine members of the elite Politburo Standing Committee, often seen as the power brokers of the national government, will be replaced in the fall. That might seem to leave little to invest in. But BlackRock and others are targeting the millions of Chinese consumers who can purchase basic goods — refrigerators and ovens — for the first time. That means putting money into companies such as China Mobile Ltd and Shanghai Industrial Holdings Ltd  that provide basics such as cell phone service, tobacco and paper and packaging materials. It is a strategy that is becoming popular with fund managers and analysts. Edmund Harriss, manager of the $171 million Guinness Atkinson China and Hong Kong fund, has been moving his portfolio deeper into Chinese companies that provide consumer goods. Paul Dietrich, head of global research at Middleburg, Virgina-based Washington Wealth Management, says China’s consumers “are the next big growth area.” “Over the next decade, it’s the boring, Warren Buffett-type companies that are going to do exceedingly well,” he said. In large part, that is a reflection of demographic change. Economists at Deutsche Bank estimate that, by 2015, about half of China’s households will have an income whose purchasing power is equivalent to someone living in Mississippi - about $29,000. In 2010, only about 15 percent of Chinese households boasted the same level of income. Jeff Shen, who heads BlackRock’s emerging market equity group, said investors should look to multinational companies that make consumer goods. Luxury goods, in particular, are expected to continue to perform well. Tiffany and Co, for example, is expected to make 18 percent of its global sales from China, while Coach and Burberry are expected to see between 6 and 10 percent of total sales come from the country. Burberry Group Plc  and Coach Inc have performed particularly well already in 2012. The shares of each company are up more than 20 percent. Investors could also benefit by targeting domestic Chinese companies, Shen said. In the fund he manages, the $85 million BlackRock Emerging Market Long/Short Fund, Shen owns China Mobile and is shorting export-focused companies such as China Shipping Container Lines Co Ltd “Valuations have come down quite a lot over the 18 months and look a lot more attractive today,” he said. It is generally easier for a U.S.-based investor to hold Chinese stocks through an ETF or fund. The $905 million SPDR S&P; China ETF, for instance, holds Chinese companies that are listed in Hong Kong or New York. The fund, which Morningstar named as its pick for broad exposure to the Chinese stock market, holds 165 long positions in stocks. It costs 59 cents per $100 invested and yields 1.9 percent. China Mobile, China Construction Bank Corp  and Internet search company Baidu Inc are its top holdings, with about 20 percent of assets. BlackRock reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.     Excluding the costs of some compensation plans and some other expenses, the firm earned $3.16 per share. On that basis, analysts on average had expected $3.04, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said its profits were bolstered by strong inflows into its popular iShares ETF business.

195,BLK,US CEO pay gains slow amid investor discontent -study,"* CEO pay rose 14 pct in 2011 vs 23 pct in 2010 * AFL-CIO presidents says Citigroup pay vote “a bell-ringer” * Mutual funds still vote with management on most pay votes * BlackRock with management on pay in 97 pct of votes By Ross Kerber April 19 (Reuters) - Compensation of top executives at publicly traded companies rose by 14 percent on average in 2011, a sharp slowdown from the prior year amid growing shareholder pressure on pay and performance, the AFL-CIO said in a report on Thursday. The results demonstrate that shareholders are beginning to focus on executive pay and corporate boards are paying attention, Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor group, said during a conference call to present the findings. “The good news is that after 15 years, shareholders are beginning to protest,” he said. Compensation for top executives in 2010 had risen on average by 23 percent, the ALF-CIO said. The union released the study two days after Citigroup  shareholders shocked the giant bank’s board with a vote on no confidence on its executive pay package for 2011, which  included $14.8 million for Chief Executive Vikram Pandit. In an advisory “say on pay” vote required by the Dodd-Frank law, 55 percent of voting shareholders opposed the pay plan. The surprise rejection vote was “a bell-ringer” showing how investors are giving companies tougher reviews, Trumka said. “Shareholders are more concerned, and hopefully that will have an even more moderating effect,” he added. The study by the AFL-CIO, a federation of 56 unions that represent more than 12 million workers, reviewed the pay for the chief executives of about 300 companies in the Standard & Poor’s  500 index that so far had disclosed 2011 compensation in proxies filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The results were generally consistent with surveys done by private-sector firms. Total pay as reported in company “summary compensation tables” rose by 2 percent in 2011 compared with a 24 percent gain the prior year, according to a survey of about 225 companies in the Fortune 1000 that filed proxies by late March, Fr an k Glassner, partner of Meridian Compensation Partners, said. Compensation growth slowed amid the flat financial performance of many companies because boards of directors have added new measures to link executive pay more closely with actual results, Glassner said. “Pay for performance is starting to be engaged,” he said. Also, “say on pay” votes like the one at Citigroup, though only advisory, are adding public pressure for more corporate responsiveness, Glassner said. The AFL-CIO study also analyzed how large mutual fund families vote on pay questions. As major shareholders, the firms often decide the outcome of proxy contests, yet rarely discuss their voting. As a result, the regulatory filings they make each summer provide a rare window on their thinking. Among 40 fund firms last year, the median level of support for “say on pay” questions was 12 percent. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager with about $3.7 trillion of assets under management, was dubbed a “pay enabler” by union officials. BlackRock voted against management on “say on pay” votes just 3 percent of the time last year, the study found. Some smaller firms voted with management even more often, including Harbor Funds and the fund unit of Goldman Sachs Group . Both opposed only about 1 percent of “say on pay” questions. Officials of BlackRock, Harbor and Goldman Sachs were not immediately available for comment.",4192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/executivepay-union/us-ceo-pay-gains-slow-amid-investor-discontent-study-idUSL2E8FJ58B20120419

200,BLK,Fund managers struggled on shift from equity funds,"BOSTON (Reuters) - In the midst of the stock market’s giant first quarter, the best since 1998, investors drove up share prices of money managers expecting booming results. But as the results came in, investors headed for the exits after discovering just how reliant money managers remained on out-of-favor stock funds. Starting on April 18 with BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the biggest money manager, and running through May 2 with Franklin Resources Inc (BEN.N), investors were disappointed with underwhelming revenue and profit growth. Across the industry, fund customers gravitated away from higher fee, actively managed stock funds and toward low-fee bond and index funds. “When you have inflows into fixed-income funds and outflows in equity funds that equates into margin and fee pressure,” said John Miller, a portfolio manager for Ariel Fund in Chicago, which owns shares in Franklin, T. Rowe Price Group (TROW.O) and Janus Capital Group JNS.N. Through Thursday, shares of BlackRock had lost 9 percent since the New York firm reported just a 1 percent increase in profit last month. Janus has lost 9 percent since its underwhelming earnings report on April 24. And shares of Franklin, based in San Mateo, California, have traded down 5 percent in the days since it reported. The share movements show how just how hard it is for many investors to judge fund companies based on broad market currents, said Gib Watson, chief executive of Envestnet Prima, an asset management research company. And the quarter’s results provided a stark reminder that the companies can’t count on equity products as they did in the past. “Investors remained scarred, scared and conservative coming out of the global financial crisis,” Watson said. Investors fled equities after many were burned by volatility in recent years, but as usual many are fighting the last war. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX finished the first quarter at 1,408.47, up 12 percent from the end of December and up 6 percent from the end of the first quarter of 2011. Fearful investors missed the rally. Investors pulled $21 billion from actively managed large cap U.S. stock funds during the first quarter of 2012, according to Chicago research firm Morningstar Inc That marked the eleventh straight quarter of net outflows in the high-profit category, which was once the industry’s bread and butter. In all, U.S. stock funds lost $13 billion in the first quarter and $121 billion over the past 12 months. All other top categories of long-term funds took in money including international stock funds, bond funds, and those that invest in commodities or alternative areas like real estate. That helped the companies with non-traditional products, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Marc Irizarry. Several managers also looked to impress investors by boosting their dividends in the quarter including T Rowe Price, Invesco and Legg Mason (LM.N), Irizarry noted in a May 3 report. The higher dividends were “in line with the trend of investors seeking income and flows towards income products,” he wrote. Shares in several companies have been flat or down since they announced results, driving a decline in the Dow Jones index of U.S. asset managers .DJUSAG since the end of March. In retrospect, the strong stock market in the first quarter boosted total assets at most of the managers, and that helped bolster fee income. But anticipating even higher earnings, investors drove up shares in big asset managers during the run-up to earnings season. That only set up companies like BlackRock for disappointment. Shares of the company, the world’s largest asset manager, fell 3 percent on April 18 after it reported a revenue decline of 1 percent to $2.2 billion. Assets rose 5 percent during the quarter but only 1 percent compared with a year earlier. BlackRock’s problem was that flows went to the company’s indexed funds instead of actively managed accounts that generate higher fees. Franklin Resources also failed to capitalize on the rising market. Its shares fell 3 percent on May 2 even though it reported a quarterly inflow of $5.6 billion, since the flows fell short of investor expectations. Flows to U.S. equity funds were just $200 million, for instance, which contributed to an overall flow total that Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr described as good but not great — or, as he put it in the headline of a research note to investors, “Good, but Not Franklinsanity.” ",5042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-moneymanagers-equities/fund-managers-struggled-on-shift-from-equity-funds-idUSTRE84316V20120504

206,BLK,Barclays to sell $6.1 billion BlackRock stake,"LONDON (Reuters) - British bank Barclays is selling its near-20 percent stake in U.S. asset manager BlackRock, worth $6.1 billion, as tougher global regulations have cut the attraction of such holdings. Barclays has held the stake for almost three years, a legacy of BlackRock’s $15 billion purchase of Barclays Global Investors, but Basel III regulations mean banks have to hold more capital against minority stakes in asset managers and other firms, making it less profitable. “All this is just showing how difficult it is for banks to make a profit and sufficient RoE (return on equity) in the new regulatory environment. They are deleveraging or pursuing transactions like this to improve capital ratios,” said Richard Barfield, a director at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Barclays said the shares would be sold by way of an offering and a related buyback by BlackRock of up to $1 billion of the stock. Bookbuilding was expected to take a couple of days before the price of the share sale is finalized, possibly on Wednesday, bankers said. Barclays is set to make about 400 million pounds on the deal. By 1510 GMT BlackRock shares were down 0.8 percent at $170.48. Barclays shares were up 2.1 percent at 179.9 pence in London, outperforming a 1 percent rise by the European bank sector index. “The question was always would they sell ahead of Basel III fully coming in, so there’s a logic to it,” said Mike Trippitt, analyst at Oriel Securities in London. Barclays holds BlackRock common stock and convertible stock representing a 19.6 percent economic interest in the firm, equivalent to about 35.2 million shares. BlackRock bought BGI in a cash and share deal in June 2009, making it the world’s largest money manager, almost doubling its size. It was seen as a good deal for Barclays, giving it a much-needed capital boost at a time when all banks were under strain. The deal also left BlackRock as one of the biggest shareholders in Barclays, with a 7.1 percent stake. Barclays said the future of that holding was a matter for BlackRock, and BlackRock declined to comment on its holding. Barclays Capital, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are joint bookrunners for the offer. A prospectus was filed by BlackRock on Monday. New York-based BlackRock, founded more than 20 years ago as a one-room bond investment firm, grew to become the world’s largest publicly traded asset manager through a series of acquisitions, led by Chairman and CEO Laurence Fink. It bought BGI after sidestepping the toxic assets that laid low many competitors in the financial crisis, particularly attracted by its exchange-traded funds arm. It now has $3.7 trillion of assets under management. Selling shares at current prices would see Barclays book a 400-500 million pound gain, worth about 10 basis points to its core capital, analysts at Espirito Santo estimated. The original value of the BGI deal of $13.5 billion, including $6.6 billion in cash, was revised to $15.2 billion when it completed at the end of 2009 after BlackRock shares rallied to more than $220. But last year Barclays marked down the value of the shares by 1.8 billion pounds to 3.4 billion pounds, or $5.5 billion, after the shares fell back to $148. The decision to sell by Barclays Chief Executive Bob Diamond is part of his attempt to get RoE back above 13 percent, partly by selling or closing down areas or investments that do not measure up. Other banks have sold asset management businesses in recent years or are trying to do so, including Rabobank selling its Robeco funds unit, and there are sales underway at Deutsche Bank and Dexia. “From a regulatory capital perspective, we could see more banks selling parts of their business to improve available capital resources,” PwC’s Barfield said. Diamond is a director at BlackRock, and Barclays will lose its right to a position on the board 90 days after completion. The original sale of BGI attracted criticism as it reaped a big windfall for Diamond and many other Barclays staff, thanks to a lucrative past incentive scheme. Former Barclays CEO John Varley is an independent BlackRock director. ",5212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-barclays-blackrock/barclays-to-sell-6-1-billion-blackrock-stake-idUSBRE84K0FT20120521

While the group raised its exposure, executives within the team said Chesapeake’s management issues are still a “distraction,” the source said. Last month, Reuters reported that Chesapeake Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon had pledged his interests in many Chesapeake wells as collateral for more than $1.1 billion of personal loans. That prompted conflict-of-interest concerns among investors, who feared that McClendon might have obtained more favorable loan terms in exchange for allowing his lenders to do other business with the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-based company. Shares have been under selling pressure since, hitting a year low of 13.32 on May 17. Shares ended Thursday up 3.25 percent at $15.58. BlackRock’s Global Resources team oversees more than $5 billion in assets, as of March 30. A BlackRock representative declined to comment. In response to the corporate governance issues, Chesapeake said that McClendon would give up his role as chairman, while retaining the chief executive’s job. It also said it will end the program allowing McClendon to invest in its wells in June 2014, or 18 months earlier than originally planned. Blackrock Inc had assets under management of more than $3.5 trillion at the end of 2011. It was not clear how much of Chesapeake Blackrock Inc owns, but in the first quarter, BlackRock Institutional Trust Co bought a net 350,000 shares of Chesapeake, boosting its ownership to 23.2 million shares, or 3.5 percent, at the end of the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Private equity fund CVC Capital Partners recently sold a “pre-IPO” stake for $1.6 billion in Formula One to a group of investors including the investment management firm BlackRock, shaving its stake to 42 percent. Formula One will seek a valuation of about 18-22 times earnings for the IPO, which is expected to be completed in June, sources have told Reuters. “We looked at the investment opportunity in Formula One, but we didn’t move forward with it, because the price ahead of the flotation was too high,” said Elkann at a shareholders meeting on Tuesday. Exor and News Corp said in May 2011 they were teaming up to explore options for an investment in Formula One. The plan, which would have involved the two companies taking a controlling stake, did not go forward, however, because CVC decided it preferred to sell down its holding in an initial public offering.

222,BLK,RPT-BlackRock's bull retires as equity markets flounder,"* Doll says markets “haven’t been a whole lot of fun” * Lackluster performance caused board scrutiny By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market has already lost some of its bulls in the past month. Now it is about to lose one of its biggest. BlackRock Inc ‘s chief equity strategist Bob Doll told Reuters on Tuesday he was leaving the firm and the three funds he manages because he wanted to take some time off and the fun was gone. “The markets haven’t been a whole lot of fun,” the 57-year-old Doll said, adding he hoped to figure out his next move. Best known as the talking head of for BlackRock’s views on the markets and for his annual market predictions list, Doll’s bullish nature and love of fundamentals have not helped the performance of the three funds he oversees, each of which has underperformed its benchmarks for the past one, three, five and 10 years, according to Morningstar Inc. With the European debt crisis raging on, disappointing U.S. job creation numbers and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in negative territory for the year, and market volatility heightened, it might seem like a good time for a bull like Doll to walk away. But for BlackRock, which has relied on Doll to assuage investors’ concerns and answer financial advisers’ questions about the markets, the departure comes at an inopportune time. “Bob Doll and Bill Gross (co-chief investment officer at PIMCO) were the two people who were out there talking to investors during the financial crisis,” said Don Phillips, president of fund research at Morningstar Inc. “He was pretty important to the firm.” Every year, Doll has come out with 10 predictions that were almost entirely positive and, lately, off the mark. In 2011, Doll predicted accelerating economic growth, double-digit stock growth and 3 million new jobs. His S&P; forecast was too optimistic by 100 points, growth slowed in 2011 and 1.8 million jobs were created in 2011. CXO Advisory Group LLC, a research firm that tracks more than 60 market “gurus”, gives Doll an above average accuracy rating of 54 percent. This year Doll predicted that the European debt crisis would ease, even as Europe slides into a recession. “I know the second half of that is correct,” he said. Still, Doll - a regular commentator on CNBC - acknowledges that being a fundamentals-focused equity manager has not been easy lately. “Everything is so macro-focused and it’s less about the individual companies, he said. The performance of 23 developed-market stock indices compared to the MSCI World index shows a significant increase in correlation, from about a .5 correlation in the early 1980s to nearly .9 percent in recent months, according to Rui Antunes, a quantitative analyst at Societe Generale in London. When correlation is so high, economic forces hold more weight in the price of stocks than actual health and future prospects of any individual company or sector. Doll’s difficulties are evident in the track record of the  portfolios he manages. While he was a star manager in the early 2000s , his performance since he joined BlackRock as part of the merger with Merrill Lynch Investment Managers i n 2006 has been lackluster. From 2000 to 2005, his Large Cap Growth Fund lost 2.1 percent, while large cap growth funds averaged a 27 percent loss, according to Morningstar. But for the past one, three, five and 10 years, his $1.6 billion Large Cap Core Fund ; $1 billion Large Cap Growth Fund and $1 billion Large Cap Value Fund  have all underperformed their benchmarks, according to Morningstar Inc. The poor performance has drawn intense scrutiny from the funds’ board of directors, who meet quarterly to review the funds’ strategies, each of which is based on a quantitative model. “They were concerned about how the models were being run, how the analysts picked stocks, what the risk management was,” Doll said. As a result, BlackRock made some changes to the funds in 2010, when it brought on Peter Stournaras and Chris Leavy. Stournaras and Leavy will take over Doll’s responsibilities after his June 30 departure. Doll will serve as an adviser to the firm through the rest of the year. As for Doll, he has summer plans to go to Paris with his wife to visit their daughter, spend time with family in Texas, and vacation at the New Jersey shore. After that, Doll said he isn’t sure what’s next for him. Whether BlackRock will find someone new to hold investors’ hands during volatile times is unclear. The firm has expanded into passive management through its acquisition of the iShares exchange-traded fund business and over the years has grown its fixed income business as well. “Doll stands for equities and actively managed funds and given how BlackRock has evolved maybe it’s time for them to have a different face,” Phillips said.",6052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-doll-retire/rpt-blackrocks-bull-retires-as-equity-markets-flounder-idUSL1E8H5KK620120605

But for the past one, three, five and 10 years, his $1.6 billion Large Cap Core Fund ; $1 billion Large Cap Growth Fund and $1 billion Large Cap Value Fund  have all underperformed their benchmarks, according to Morningstar Inc. The poor performance has drawn intense scrutiny from the funds’ board of directors, who meet quarterly to review the funds’ strategies, each of which is based on a quantitative model. “They were concerned about how the models were being run, how the analysts picked stocks, what the risk management was,” Doll said. As a result, BlackRock made some changes to the funds in 2010, when it brought on Peter Stournaras and Chris Leavy. Stournaras and Leavy will take over Doll’s responsibilities after his June 30 departure. Doll will serve as an adviser to the firm through the rest of the year. As for Doll, he has summer plans to go to Paris with his wife to visit their daughter, spend time with family in Texas, and vacation at the New Jersey shore. After that, Doll said he isn’t sure what’s next for him. Whether BlackRock will find someone new to hold investors’ hands during volatile times is unclear. The firm has expanded into passive management through its acquisition of the iShares exchange-traded fund business and over the years has grown its fixed income business as well. “Doll stands for equities and actively managed funds and given how BlackRock has evolved maybe it’s time for them to have a different face,” Phillips said.",6052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-doll-retire/blackrocks-bull-retires-as-equity-markets-flounder-idUSL1E8H5BLF20120605

227,BLK,UPDATE 1-Morningstar reviewing BlackRock energy fund rating,"* Ratings agency cites potential conflict of interest * Report advises shareholders to invest elsewhere By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Morningstar Inc is reviewing its rating on BlackRock Inc’s Energy & Resources Fund  due to a potential conflict of interest regarding one its portfolio managers, the investment research company said. Dan Rice, one of the portfolio managers of the $953 million fund, founded a natural gas drilling company, Rice Energy, in 2005. As first reported by The Wall Street Journal, a subsidiary of Rice Energy, Rice Drilling, in 2010 entered into a joint venture with Alpha Natural Resources, a holding in the BlackRock Energy & Resources Fund. Since that joint venture, the fund has increased its ownership in Alpha Natural Resources. Alpha currently is a top 10 holding of the fund, making up 4.85 percent of its holding as of April 30, according to Morningstar. The potential downgrade that Morningstar is considering would affect its analyst rating of the fund, a fairly recent category that is in addition to its star ratings of funds. In a report announcing that Morningstar was reviewing its Bronze analyst rating for the fund, analyst Rob Wherry said BlackRock has made it clear that Dan Rice is no longer involved with the day-to-day business of Rice Energy, which is now run by his sons. Wherry also said BlackRock has stated that its increased holdings of Alpha were due to Alpha’s acquisition of Massey Energy in early 2011, a top holding for the fund. “Clear disclosure would have helped investors make better decisions about owning this fund,” Wherry wrote in his report, entitled “Stewardship issues are overshadowing this fund’s merits.” While there has been no evidence that shareholders were hurt by the situation, “it does raise enough concerns about stewardship and future conflicts that existing shareholders should consider other category options for their new dollars while demanding information about Rice’s dealings,” Wherry wrote. Wherry declined to comment beyond his report until he had talked to BlackRock. A spokeswoman for BlackRock said the money manager “maintains rigorous policies and procedures to manage conflicts, including requiring employees to seek prior approval from compliance for any outside investments or business activities.” The spokeswoman, Bobbie Collins, added, “With respect to Dan Rice, the firm also put in place additional procedures to mitigate any potential conflict involving Rice Energy, including requiring Dan to recuse himself from all decisions involving Rice Energy’s joint venture with Alpha Natural Resources.” Chicago-based Morningstar introduced its analyst ratings in November. They are designed to complement its star ratings and take into account other factors besides past performance, such as a fund’s managers, its parent company, and its stable of analysts. Even though Morningstar’s analyst ratings are still new and do not yet have the same weight with investors as its star ratings, a downgrade in an analyst rating is actually more significant, said David Snowball, founder of MutualFundObserver.com, which examines and critiques the mutual fund business. “The analyst ratings are probably more predictive of the performance of the fund,” he said. “And when the analyst rating is a source of moral judgment, it may start to stick with investors.” Observers said they were surprised that BlackRock allowed the potential for conflict of interest to occur. “The potential for conflict of interest is there and I am surprised BlackRock’s compliance department didn’t have the same conclusion,” said Jeff Tjornehoj, head of research at Lipper. Lipper, which takes into account only quantitative metrics for its ratings, gives the BlackRock fund a 4 rating on a 5-point scale based on its past three-year performance.",6082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-rating-morningstar/update-1-morningstar-reviewing-blackrock-energy-fund-rating-idUSL1E8H8DWJ20120608

The appointment reflects BlackRock’s ambition to raise its profile in Europe’s fragmented funds industry, where it competes with scores of firms that have a tight hold on their domestic markets via relationships with local banks. It also fits with the New York-based investment house’s efforts to forge a reputation for advising governments and regulators, a role often played by big investment banks such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N). Since the euro zone crisis erupted, BlackRock has advised policymakers on the restructuring of Irish and Greek sovereign debt, echoing its work with the U.S. Federal Reserve following the collapse of insurer AIG. Supremely well connected among policymakers and bankers, Hildebrand’s appointment is expected to aid BlackRock’s expansion in this lucrative line of business. He was appointed vice chairman of the Financial Stability Board, the regulatory task force for the Group of 20 economies, just months before the scandal broke. He also relinquished that post upon leaving the SNB. BlackRock is not the first fund manager to sign up an ex-central banker. Five years ago, Allianz AG’s (ALVG.DE) Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco) hired former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan as a consultant on economic issues. In his new job, Hildebrand will be based in BlackRock’s offices in London and will take charge of the firm’s largest institutional client relationships in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific from October. He will lead a small team of existing BlackRock staff and a number of new hires that will focus on guiding major clients on investment against a backdrop of uncertain central bank policy, political change and turbulent global markets. “He will contribute a unique perspective on global markets and economic trends to BlackRock’s investment teams and also represent the firm to senior government officials and regulators across EMEA and Asia Pacific,” BlackRock said in a statement. Hildebrand resigned from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) after he failed to prove he had not been involved in lucrative currency trades by his wife, Kashya, just weeks before he oversaw the introduction of a cap on the Swiss franc’s value. The former Moore Capital hedge fund manager, who controlled his own portfolio while at the SNB, was later found not to have broken the central bank’s old rules, which were tightened up after the scandal. He joined the SNB in 2003, rising to chairman in 2010, and won praise for helping to orchestrate the 2008 bailout of UBS UBSN.VX, which prompted tougher Swiss banking regulations. Since March, he has been a visiting fellow at the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University - where he studied at Lincoln College and received his doctorate in international relations in 1994. Hildebrand made his first public appearance in Switzerland since the scandal last week at an economic conference, where he discussed the euro zone crisis and the urgent need to stabilize the European banking system. His latest move marks a return to the private sector, where he began his career before becoming a central banker.

241,BLK,BlackRock manager steps down from energy fund,"June 17 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc portfolio manager Daniel Rice is going to step down as co-manager of the firm’s energy mutual funds but will remain in the company, a BlackRock spokeswoman said on Sunday. Rice’s move comes in the wake of a potential conflict of interest that involves Rice’s family business and holdings in the BlackRock Energy & Resources Fund, which he co-manages. The possible conflict stems from a joint venture formed with Alpha Natural Resources and a subsidiary of the natural gas drilling company founded by Rice. Since that joint venture, BlackRock increased its ownership in Alpha Natural Resources. BlackRock declined to comment further. Rice has also agreed not to serve as an officer at his family businesses or participate in fundraising for the companies, BlackRock told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the move. Earlier in June, Morningstar said it was reviewing its rating on BlackRock’s Energy & Resources Fund due to the potential conflict of interest regarding Rice’s family business. .",6172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-rice/blackrock-manager-steps-down-from-energy-fund-idUSL1E8HH31A20120617
242,BLK,UPDATE 1-Greek bank bad loans seen at 30 bln eur- banker,"* Central bank to release Blackrock findings in near future * Estimated 30 bln euro loan impairments next 3 years * Amount includes 18 bln eur provisions already booked ATHENS, June 19 (Reuters) - Greek banks stand to lose 30 billion euros from impaired loans in the next three years according to stress simulations of their loan books by Blackrock Solutions, Greece’s former IMF representative said on Tuesday. Greek banks have been battered by the country’s severe debt crisis and a protracted, deep recession which has caused an increase in non-performing loans as unemployment has hit record highs near 23 percent. Blackrock was hired by the Bank of Greece, the country’s central bank, to conduct an independent diagnostic study on bank loan books under stress conditions to assess loan quality going forward and help determine provisioning needs. “The expected losses (for Greek banks) from impaired loans were set by Blackrock, based on stress scenarios, at 30 billion euros in the next three years,” Panagiotis Roumeliotis, non-executive vice chairman at Piraeus Bank, said in a speech to a risk conference. Roumeliotis said the figure he mentioned in his speech included sums already set aside by banks as buffers for bad loans. “Banks have already booked provisions, about 18 billion euros. These are included in the 30 billion euro estimate,” Roumeliotis, who was appointed Greece’s representative to the IMF in February 2010 and joined Piraeus in December 2011, told Reuters. The Bank of Greece declined to comment and said the Blackrock findings would be released soon. “The Bank of Greece will release the Blackrock report in the near future in cooperation with the (EU/ECB/IMF) troika,” an official at the central bank said. The ratio of non-performming loans on Greek banks’ loan books reached 15.9 percent at the end-December 2011, the central bank has said. Greece’s 215 billion euro economy is seen contracting for a fifth straight year in 2012. The latest forecasts by the Bank of Greece and the OECD see gross domestic product (GDP) shrinking 5.0-5.3 percent this year.",6192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/greece-banks/update-1-greek-bank-bad-loans-seen-at-30-bln-eur-banker-idUSL5E8HJEQ320120619

249,BLK,Analysis: Wave of departures raises BlackRock questions,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A series of high-level departures from BlackRock this month has raised questions about the direction of the world’s largest money manager. Coming in rapid succession over the past two weeks, the departures included Susan Wagner, a founding partner and vice chairman, who will retire at the end of June, and Robert Capaldi, who has already left and was senior client strategist for Chief Executive Laurence Fink. New York-based BlackRock also announced the departures of two of the firm’s most prominent portfolio managers, chief equity strategist Bob Doll and energy sector fund star Daniel Rice. Rice will help transition some of his funds, a process that is expected to last through December and Doll will retire at the end of month, BlackRock said. Wagner’s departure was the most significant of the four as it further signals the end of growth through large acquisitions for BlackRock, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. One of the original partners of the firm, Wagner joined from the Lehman Brothers mortgage department when Fink opened for business in 1988. Frequently named to published lists as one of the most powerful women in business, Wagner will join BlackRock’s board of directors where she will continue to have a say on strategy, spokeswoman Bobbie Collins said. Some BlackRock employees are worried Wagner’s departure may signal bigger changes or further departures from the firm, possibly including Fink moving into a government role, according to two people familiar with the situation. One of these people, and another person familiar with the situation, said further senior-level changes are expected in the coming weeks. “People are speculating that Sue is stepping down because Larry is going to make a move for government,” said the person, who declined to be identified because he was told this in confidence. For the past several months, rumors have been circulating that Fink is a candidate for U.S. Treasury Secretary if President Barack Obama is re-elected in November. There’s also concern about how BlackRock is handling the other departures. For example, client relationship managers at BlackRock, whose job it is to assuage investors’ concerns, did not have any talking points to discuss regarding the Rice situation after it became known that he would be leaving, according to one person who spoke to a client relationship manager at the firm, and declined to be identified because the conversation was confidential. “People are getting client calls and they have no talking points,” the person said. BlackRock has maintained that most of the changes were part of the firm’s necessary restructuring after digesting two huge mergers in the past six years and growing to a previously unprecedented size of $4 trillion. Three years ago, BlackRock absorbed Barclays Global Investors and its $1.8 trillion of assets, doubling the firm overnight. That followed the 2006 acquisition of almost $600 billion in Merrill Lynch’s fund division. CEO Fink has lately been saying that he is done with mega-mergers for the foreseeable future. Formerly BlackRock’s head of corporate strategy, Wagner coordinated acquisition activity including the Barclays deal and the Merrill buy. BlackRock spokeswoman Collins said the recent departures among fund managers and senior staff were not related. “The personnel changes people are seeing are neither related nor a trend,” she said. Investors have so far brushed off the departures. Shares of BlackRock rose 5.3 percent over the past month, outpacing the S&P; 500’s 1.5 percent gain. As Wagner departs, BlackRock has made several recent high-level hires with a non-U.S. focus. Former Swiss central bank chairman Philipp Hildebrand, who quit that post after a controversy involving his wife’s currency trading, joined as vice chairman. And Mark McCombe, who was Chief Executive Officer in Hong Kong for HSBC, came on board as BlackRock’s Chairman for Asia-Pacific. Capaldi’s advisory role was eliminated when he left, BlackRock said, but his prior role heading the firm’s U.S. and Canadian institutional business was filled in 2011 by the hire of Edwin Conway, a senior managing director from private equity shop Blackstone. The end of mega-mergers is likely good news for BlackRock clients. Industry experts wonder if some of BlackRock’s recent issues, particularly the questions regarding energy fund manager Rice, stem from failures in oversight due to the big mergers in recent years. Rice left in the wake of a potential conflict of interest that involved his family business. The energy mutual funds Rice had co-managed at BlackRock increased their holdings in Alpha Natural Resources ANR.N after that company formed a joint venture with a unit of a natural gas drilling company founded by Rice. “It is hard to explain how if they knew about (the Rice situation), they were okay with it,” said Russ Kinnel, director of mutual fund research at Morningstar. “The mergers may have left some gaps in their compliance.” Doll, who joined BlackRock in 2006 when it acquired Merrill Lynch’s money management unit, will retire at the end of June. In January, BlackRock removed language from the prospectus of Doll’s funds stating that they used “proprietary” quantitative investment models, instead saying the models came from “third-party research firms. And two of Doll’s three funds, BlackRock’s Large Cap Core Fund (MCLRX.O) and Large Cap Value Fund (MALVX.O), have trailed the performance of the vast majority of similar funds over the past three years. BlackRock CEO Fink has a history of moving on quickly when fund managers disappoint. “We’re very confident in Larry Fink,” said Macrae Sykes, an analyst at Gabelli & Co in Rye, New York. “He will swiftly and appropriately address any issues with underperformance or reputational risk.” “Compliance and reputational care are very, very important to BlackRock,” BlackRock spokeswoman Collins said. The recent string of departures may concern financial advisers who work with BlackRock, Kinnel said. BlackRock has said it wants to double its retail mutual fund business to $600 billion by the end of 2014, largely by targeting registered investment advisers. “It’s not yet to the point where this will send advisers fleeing, but it doesn’t give you a particularly good feeling,” Kinnel said.

254,BLK,Search for income drives record ETP flows,"LONDON (Reuters) - Exchange-traded products (ETPs) posted record inflows during the first half of 2012, with much of the new money headed into yield bearing products as investors hunted for income, often with an eye on corporate bonds, new research shows. The industry pulled in more than $100 billion of net new money in the first half, a 16 percent rise year-on-year and the strongest inflows for the period since the industry emerged a few decades ago, data from Blackrock showed on Thursday. The growth was mainly fuelled by appetite for fixed income-and dividend-paying equity ETPs, Blackrock said. Fixed income products saw assets more than double from a year earlier, making up 41 percent of all global inflows, and now account for 18 percent of the $1.68 trillion of global assets under management, estimates Blackrock. “Demand for exposure to fixed income assets has been a key theme for the last year and shows no sign of abating,” said Dodd Kittsley, Global head of ETP research at Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager and ETF provider via its iShares arm. There were marked differences within the fixed income space though, with investors fleeing troubled European government debt and flocking into corporate bonds. ETPs offering exposure to European government bonds recorded outflows of $1 billion year-to-date, while high yield corporate ETPs and investment grade ETPs pulled in $8 billion and $15.5 billion respectively. Exchange-traded products (ETPs) is an umbrella term that covers exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and others. ETFs trade like a share and track an index, either by holding the underlying assets, or by synthetically replicating the returns using derivatives. The index-tracking vehicles have become increasingly popular among investors seeking cheap access to indices without having to buy the underlying securities and as a diversification tool into more illiquid markets around the world. But cautious investors are also debating the merits of passive management vehicles as opposed to more nimble active investing at a time of heightened volatility as markets remain in thrall to the euro zone crisis. Equity ETPs accounted for 70 percent of assets under management, with developed market equity ETPs recording inflows of $40.5 billion year-to-date whilst developed market equity mutual funds have seen outflows of $66 billion, data provider EPFR estimates. European equity ETPs continue to buck the trend as investors remain fearful of the outcome of the euro zone crisis, with recorded outflows of $900 million year-to-date, although June saw inflows of $1.8 billion. Pimco’s Total Return ETF, a clone of the firm’s $252 billion Total Return Fund launched in March pulled in $1.7 billion in net new money to rank it the third most popular launch of the year behind two Asian-listed products, Huatai-Pinebridge CSI 300 ETF and Harvest Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index ETF. State Street’s S&P; 500 and Gold ETPs continued to dominate in terms of assets under management, with $103 billion and $65 billion AUM respectively. Commodity ETPs hit $178 billion in assets or 11 percent market share, recording $5.4 billion in new money year-to-date. Geographically, the United States continues to lead, with $1.18 trillion of assets or 70 percent market share compared with Europe’s $305 billion or 18 percent share followed by Asia Pacific with $111 billion or 7 percent share. Global assets under management at $1.68 trillion is below a peak hit at the end of March of $1.728 trillion due to market movements, but 10 percent higher than the end of 2011, says Blackrock.

255,BLK,Analysis: Is BlackRock planning for life after Fink?,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After two decades of growth by acquisition, BlackRock Inc stands unrivaled in size and breadth among asset management firms. But as Chief Executive Laurence Fink shifts the company’s focus from being an acquirer to operating its businesses, some industry executives, analysts and even employees say BlackRock lacks a clear strategy. Fink has said the firm is done with large acquisitions for now, but has offered little on how it will improve its funds’ middling performance. A recent spate of high-level departures, one tinged with controversy, and rumors that Fink may leave to take the post of U.S. Treasury Secretary if it is offered to him, have only increased concern about BlackRock’s direction and who will lead it. More changes in the senior ranks are in the works, including possible new departures, according to people familiar with the situation. The board also is discussing succession planning in case Fink leaves, the sources said. “I would assume that there is a plan internally, but it is hard to see what it is from the outside,” said Geoff Bobroff, a fund consultant based in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. BlackRock declined to make any executives available for comment for this article. The firm would not comment on its business or talk in detail about its succession plans, but said its board is always focused on talent. BlackRock’s business is hardly in trouble. It manages $3.68 trillion in assets and dominates much of the investment industry. It is the world’s largest provider of exchange-traded funds, and among the biggest asset managers globally. Many on Wall Street profess faith in Fink, who helped found the firm in 1988 and is its controlling force. BlackRock also has a number of seasoned executives under Fink. President Robert Kapito is Fink’s heir apparent, according to three people familiar with the situation. BlackRock is so large that U.S. regulators are considering whether it should be deemed too big to fail, like its rival PIMCO, and receive tighter regulatory oversight. Regulators worry that BlackRock manages so much money for pension funds that it could hammer the economy if it ever went under. The New York-based firm has lobbied hard to fend off the “systemically important” designation. But for all its size and stature, the firm’s fund results are far from industry leaders. Most of its investment funds have failed to match the performance of their competitors at other companies over the past five years, according to Morningstar. Last year, BlackRock attracted little new money from investors. And its financial performance has slowed. In June, amid news of the executive departures, BlackRock shares fell 0.6 percent while the Dow Jones U.S. Asset Managers Index rose 6.5 percent. One foundation manager said he would not put money with BlackRock because its size makes it hard to manage money well. “BlackRock is currently not firing on all cylinders,” said Chris Spahr, an analyst at CLSA. He has an “underperform” rating on the firm although he thinks it is strong at its core. “What is good is not good enough and what is bad is worse than it should be,” Spahr said referring to BlackRock’s funds, which overall are average. The weakness has prompted some observers to say Fink needs new people to handle operations or he should cede more control to Kapito, a BlackRock co-founder, and others. “For years every decision, from should we buy a company to picking the wine for the managing director dinner,” was made by Fink and co-founders Sue Wagner, Ralph Schlosstein and Barbara Novick, said a person familiar with the situation. BlackRock has recently added to its management ranks. Former Swiss central bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand has joined as a vice chairman focused on non-U.S. institutional clients. Mark McCombe, who was CEO in Hong Kong for HSBC, also came on board as BlackRock’s chairman for Asia-Pacific. At the same time, a number of longtime senior executives have left or announced they are leaving. In June, BlackRock announced that Bob Doll, its high-profile chief equity strategist, was retiring. The funds he managed had underperformed their competitors for years, and Reuters disclosed that Doll had used outside models to pick stocks. BlackRock had previously said the picks were his own. Wagner, who served as chief operating officer and vice chairman, announced in June that she was retiring from the firm. She will join the board. Robert Capaldi, who served as senior client strategist for Fink, also left in June. His position is not being filled. Also in June, BlackRock said portfolio manager Daniel Rice was leaving following disclosures that the energy funds he co-managed invested in businesses in which his family had stakes. The potential conflict of interest, which emerged in news reports, raised questions about whether the firm can effectively oversee its massive operations. Some of BlackRock’s client relationship managers said they were upset at not having talking points to reassure clients after Rice’s departure. “The Rice situation is deeply disappointing,” said Harry Milling, an analyst who covers BlackRock for Morningstar. “One can only wonder whether this raises questions in investor minds about what else might be going on.” BlackRock has said the departures are unrelated to one another. Given the scale and complexity of BlackRock’s business, and particularly with the recent headlines, analysts said they want to hear more from the other business heads. “I haven’t gotten exposure to senior managers there to get a sense of who is capable of what,” said Jason Weyeneth, a senior research analyst with Sterne Agee, based in Birmingham, Alabama. “The firm needs to do a better job of showing their bench strength.” Some wonder if adopting a co-chief or heir apparent structure similar to PIMCO’s might be a better model for BlackRock, given its size. And if Kapito is in fact the heir apparent, the firm might be well served by getting that message out more. “It’s all about Larry,” said a former chief executive of a fund company, who declined to be identified because he did not want to be on Fink’s bad side. “If I were him, I would want people to see another face.” ",7052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-succession/analysis-is-blackrock-planning-for-life-after-fink-idUSBRE8640N320120705

The growth was mainly fuelled by appetite for fixed income-and dividend-paying equity ETPs, Blackrock said. Fixed income products saw assets more than double from a year earlier, making up 41 percent of all global inflows, and now account for 18 percent of the $1.68 trillion of global assets under management, estimates Blackrock. “Demand for exposure to fixed income assets has been a key theme for the last year and shows no sign of abating,” said Dodd Kittsley, Global head of ETP research at Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager and ETF provider via its iShares arm. There were marked differences within the fixed income space though, with investors fleeing troubled European government debt and flocking into corporate bonds. ETPs offering exposure to European government bonds recorded outflows of $1 billion year-to-date, while high yield corporate ETPs and investment grade ETPs pulled in $8 billion and $15.5 billion respectively. Exchange-traded products (ETPs) is an umbrella term that covers exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and others. ETFs trade like a share and track an index, either by holding the underlying assets, or by synthetically replicating the returns using derivatives. The index-tracking vehicles have become increasingly popular among investors seeking cheap access to indices without having to buy the underlying securities and as a diversification tool into more illiquid markets around the world. But cautious investors are also debating the merits of passive management vehicles as opposed to more nimble active investing at a time of heightened volatility as markets remain in thrall to the euro zone crisis. Equity ETPs accounted for 70 percent of assets under management, with developed market equity ETPs recording inflows of $40.5 billion year-to-date whilst developed market equity mutual funds have seen outflows of $66 billion, data provider EPFR estimates. European equity ETPs continue to buck the trend as investors remain fearful of the outcome of the euro zone crisis, with recorded outflows of $900 million year-to-date, although June saw inflows of $1.8 billion. Pimco’s Total Return ETF, a clone of the firm’s $252 billion Total Return Fund launched in March pulled in $1.7 billion in net new money to rank it the third most popular launch of the year behind two Asian-listed products, Huatai-Pinebridge CSI 300 ETF and Harvest Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index ETF. State Street’s S&P; 500 and Gold ETPs continued to dominate in terms of assets under management, with $103 billion and $65 billion AUM respectively. Commodity ETPs hit $178 billion in assets or 11 percent market share, recording $5.4 billion in new money year-to-date. Geographically, the United States continues to lead, with $1.18 trillion of assets or 70 percent market share compared with Europe’s $305 billion or 18 percent share followed by Asia Pacific with $111 billion or 7 percent share. Global assets under management at $1.68 trillion is below a peak hit at the end of March of $1.728 trillion due to market movements, but 10 percent higher than the end of 2011, says Blackrock.",7052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/etfs-h1/search-for-income-drives-record-etp-flows-idUSL6E8I54CL20120705
257,BLK,Canadian ETF assets rise 4.1 percent in June,"* ETF assets rise 4.1 pct in June to C$49.5 bln * Net inflows of C$1.7 bln in month * Equities lead growth TORONTO, July 11 (Reuters) - Assets managed in Canadian exchange traded funds rose by 4.1 percent to C$49.5 billion ($48.5 billion) in June as Canadian equities and fixed income saw net inflows, according to a report released on Monday. Canadian ETFs overall had net inflows of C$1.7 billion in June after assets fell in May, according to a monthly report from the Canadian ETF arm of New York-based BlackRock Inc , the world’s largest money manager. ETFs, like mutual funds, are investment vehicles that own an array of assets; unlike mutual funds, however, they trade on public exchanges. Canadian equity ETFs notched C$1.1 billion in net inflows, taking assets under management to C$26.4 billion, or 53.2 percent of total ETFs by asset class. Fixed income ETFs saw     C$398 million in inflows. BlackRock’s Canadian iShares business had a market share of  78 percent in June, with assets under management of C$38.7 billion. Bank of Montreal’s ETF assets under management were C$6.2 billion, giving it the second-largest market share at 12.5 percent. Horizon’s ETF assets under management were C$3.3 billion, while Invesco PowerShares had C$808 million in ETF assets under management, Vanguard had C$249 million, Royal Bank of Canada had C$115 million, and XTF Capital had C$81 million, the report said.",7112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/etf-canada/canadian-etf-assets-rise-4-1-percent-in-june-idUSL2E8IBB5020120711
258,BLK,BlackRock's iShares bets cheap isn't better for ETFs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the largest global exchange-traded fund provider, has been aggressive in its efforts to maintain U.S. market share but has still found itself losing ground to a cheaper, smaller rival. Since January, its San Francisco-based iShares ETF unit has started 42 ETFs and has at least 20 more planned this year. Its executives have been out front on regulatory issues and calls for more transparency in ETF labeling and the increasingly popular ETF managed portfolio space. But, one thing iShares has refused to do is cut costs to compete with rivals like Vanguard, whose ETFs, in some cases cost as little as a third of their iShares equivalents. The situation at iShares, which BlackRock bought from Barclays PLC for $13.5 billion in 2009, is emblematic of the challenges the asset manager faces as it moves from acquisition mode to management of its $3.68 trillion empire. Exchange-traded funds are baskets of securities, like mutual funds, but they trade on exchanges, like individual securities. They are cheaper than mutual funds and allow investors to trade throughout the day, with simultaneous pricing, unlike mutual funds, which price at the end of the day. While iShares is still thriving, competitors are chipping away. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs made up 40.7 percent of the $1.2 trillion U.S. ETF market as of July 9, down from 43.2 percent two years ago. Vanguard’s ETFs held 17.7 percent of U.S. ETF assets, up from 15.9 percent two years ago, according to ETF-tracking firm IndexUniverse LLC. “They are in the middle of a price war whether they admit it or not,” said David Nadig, director of research at IndexUniverse. Some industry experts say iShares’ pricing puts the firm at a disadvantage when cost is a key reason investors choose one ETF over another. They say it will eventually be forced to lower fees to compete. What’s more, some iShares ETFs have underperformed similar less-pricey Vanguard funds, resulting in a slow defection from some of iShares’ ETFs. One of BlackRock’s biggest ETFs, the $33.6 billion iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund, has seen $2.9 billion in investor money leave over the past three years as of June 30. Meanwhile, the $50.3 billion Van guard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, gained $39 billion, according to Morningstar Inc. That’s about $280 million in lost revenue for iShares. The iShares ETF, at more than triple the cost, also performed worse than the Vanguard fund for the past one, three and five years as of June 30, according to IndexUniverse. Still , iShares remains the industry leader. With $480 billion in assets in the United States, it eclipses the No. 2 player, State Street Global Advisors, which has $298.3 billion, and dwarfs Vanguard’s $211.3 billion of ETF assets, according to IndexUniverse. “Even if it bleeds assets, the (iShares) fund still gets the revenue from the money that remains in the fund,” said an industry insider who asked not to be named. BlackRock says investors are looking at other factors - not just cost - when choosing ETFs. “ETFs are not commodities,” a BlackRock spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. “Buyers care a lot about liquidity, brand, product quality and accuracy of exposure.” iShares this year has focused on products such as fixed income, equity income and low volatility emerging markets ETFs, according to BlackRock. In the first half of this year, iShares’s 50 fixed income ETFs gained $33.3 billion in investor money, according to Morningstar. That’s nearly double its inflow for the same period last year and accounts for 49 percent of year-to-date flows into all fixed income ETFs, according to Morningstar. Vanguard has rolled out lower-cost products like those BlackRock already has, prompting some advisers and 401(k) administrators to shift to Vanguard. In February 2011, ShareBuilder 401(k), which provides plans to over 3,500 small employers, replaced four iShares funds with similar Vanguard funds because they were cheaper and tracked their indices more precisely, said Stuart Robinson, head of ShareBuilder 401(k). Similarly, Ronald Colson, president of Lakewood, Colorado-based Colson Financial Group Inc, a registered investment adviser with $18 million in assets under management, said he switched out of a handful of iShares ETFs in January. “If Vanguard has the same ETFs that are identical in makeup to iShares and two-third of the cost, it is my fiduciary responsibility to my clients to switch,” Colson said. iShares is not the only ETF provider grappling with how to compete with Vanguard. As a mutual company, Vanguard is owned by its customers, and thus its profits go back into its business. That advantage makes it nearly impossible for competitors who answer to shareholders to compete on cost, experts said. “Many people underestimated the long-term value of the brand and the experience of Vanguard,” said Lee Kranefuss, the former chairman of iShares who helped launch its ETF lineup and is now an industry consultant. For BlackRock, growing the iShares business by adding products has been key to bolstering its bottom line. In the first quarter of 2012, BlackRock said, investors added $25.7 billion to its portfolios, with $18.2 billion going to iShares ETFs. BlackRock reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Being first-to-market with many types of ETFs has helped iShares gain assets, experts said. At the same time, deep relationships with market makers who facilitate the creation and redemption of ETF shares, index providers like Standard & Poor’s and brokerage firms provide iShares with the ability to secure good pricing and liquidity on its portfolios. The firm says it has 207 equity ETFs, 50 fixed-income ETFs, three commodity ETFs and 16 mixed-allocation ETFs, with 64 people on its capital markets team. In contrast, Vanguard has 64 ETFs - 52 equity and 12 fixed-income - and a capital markets team of 10. A Vanguard spokesman said its strategy to offer lowest cost ETFs is not aimed at competing with iShares. iShares has garnered loyalty from managers and advisers by acting as a matchmaker for advisers looking for model ETF portfolio providers. In May the firm held its first conference for model ETF portfolio managers, hosting 160 clients and trading firms. BlackRock projects the ETF model portfolio market, now at around $46 billion, will climb to $120 billion by 2016. “iShares recognized this model ETF portfolio market before anyone else and helped us grow,” said Robert Williams, director of research at Sage Advisory Services, an Austin, Texas-based firm with $11 billion in assets. He says iShares’ lower trading costs can offset higher expenses. For now, BlackRock’s size and position in the market give iShares the leeway to wait to cut fees until investors take greater notice. Even so, many experts and advisers believe iShares will eventually have to lower expenses on its ETFs that compete with Vanguard’s. Even then, iShares could charge more than Vanguard and still make an impact, said Tom Lydon, president of Global Trend Investments, a registered investment adviser. “I think they can pick their moment,” Lydon said. “Investors and advisers are still somewhat checked out, but once they start coming back to the markets, I believe iShares will ... cut fees.” (Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Jennifer Merritt, Walden Siew)",7172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ishares-growth/blackrocks-ishares-bets-cheap-isnt-better-for-etfs-idUSBRE86G16O20120717
259,BLK,BlackRock second-quarter profit falls 11 percent,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest money manager, said on Wednesday its second-quarter profit fell 11 percent as tumultuous market conditions cut into fee income. Chief executive Laurence Fink also sought to quell concerns about relatively weak performance in BlackRock’s equity funds and the recent departures of some top executives. Net income at New York-based BlackRock dropped to $554 million, or $3.08 per share, from $619 million, or $3.21 per share, a year earlier. Investors fretting about Europe’s debt crisis and overall global economic weakness moved out of higher risk - and higher fee - stock funds and into bonds and short-term securities, CEO Fink said. BlackRock benefits more when investors move the opposite direction, from what Fink called a “risk off” position to “risk on.” “For the remainder of 2012, unfortunately, all eyes are still going to be on politics and the economy,” Fink said on a call with analysts. U.S. elections and the coming budget showdown “will likely create additional uncertainty and lead to more soft business sentiment and probably a reduction in consumer spending,” he added. Investor interest in BlackRock’s iShares unit, the top manager of U.S. exchange-traded funds, saved the firm from an even deeper profit decline. Investors added a net $6.1 billion into iShares funds in the quarter, while withdrawing $2.3 billion combined from BlackRock’s other long-term funds. But the inflows were overwhelmed by the impact of declining worldwide markets, which cut $76.8 billion from BlackRock's long-term assets during the quarter, and currency moves, which trimmed another $16 billion. The MSCI All Country Index lost .MIWD00000PUS 6.4 percent in the second quarter while the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX lost 2.8 percent. “It was a tough quarter in tough conditions,” Dan Popowics, manager of the Fifth Third Dividend Growth FundFSPIX.O, said. “They’re not generating enough new inflows to obtain operating leverage.” All told, BlackRock’s assets under management at June 30 totaled $3.56 trillion, down 3 percent during the quarter and down 3 percent from a year earlier. Since the quarter ended, iShares alone has pulled in another $3.5 billion in July so far, Fink said on the call with analysts. But despite the inflows, BlackRock’s ETF unit has lost market share in the United States to rival Vanguard Group, particularly in some of the largest and most basic fund categories where Vanguard charges much lower fees. Fink acknowledged the challenge. “I have to give a lot of credit to Vanguard,” he said, adding he was “not pleased” about the loss of market share. BlackRock will have a plan to address the issue in coming months, he said without giving any details. BlackRock is also seeking to address underperformance in its actively managed equity segment, where just 39 percent of funds beat their benchmarks or average performance of peers over the past year, Fink said. The firm has hired some new managers and chief equity strategist Bob Doll retired last month. “Larry (Fink) and I are going to be less tolerant of performance that is not up to par with what we need,” BlackRock president Robert Kapito said on the call with analysts. BlackRock founding partner Susan Wagner announced her retirement during the quarter and the senior client strategist for the CEO, Robert Capaldi, also left, raising some questions about succession planning at the firm. Kapito said the firm had a “very strong bench” and stressed that it had engaged in formal succession planning and annual reviews of top talent for years. The firm plans to hold an investors day next year to introduce more of its leadership team to investors, he said. BlackRock’s second-quarter revenue declined 5 percent from a year earlier to $2.2 billion. Investment advisory and related fees dropped 5 percent to $2 billion. Performance-based fees, which can provide a high-margin boost to BlackRock’s bottom line, declined 18 percent to $41 million. But the fees could get a boost later in the year as some of BlackRock’s hedge funds have posted strong performance. The firm said its fixed income Obsidian fund is up 20 percent this year. Excluding certain expenses, BlackRock earned $3.10 per share. On that basis, analysts, on average, expected $3.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of BlackRock dropped 0.6 percent to $175.05 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The shares had lost 1 percent so far this year through Tuesday, trailing the 8 percent gain in the price of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

265,BLK,UPDATE 1-Copper users attack ETF plans ahead of SEC ruling,"NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. copper fabricators have ratcheted up their opposition to the copper exchanged-traded funds (ETF) planned by JPMorgan Chase & Co and BlackRock Inc ahead of a key ruling by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. Lawyers representing Southwire Co, Encore Wire Corp , Luvata and AmRod and major hedge fund and physical trader Red Kite sent the SEC a letter dated July 18 and seen by Reuters, calling on the regulator to block BlackRock’s proposal. The letter said those copper fabricators, who account for half their industry’s U.S. capacity, believe competing with the funds would force them to pay higher prices for their raw materials. A fund could also make the market more volatile, making fabricators vulnerable to a price collapse. “The risks associated with the removal of so much copper could have potentially devastating effects not just on potential investors in the shares, which should be a concern to the SEC, but also on existing and future investors in industries that depend on copper for their primary feedstock,” said the letter from attorneys at Vandenberg & Feliu LLP. Vandenberg & Feliu LLP is representing the same group in its opposition to the JPMorgan Chase product. Criticism of these products has increased ahead of the July 19 deadline for the SEC to rule on JPMorgan’s XF Physical Copper Trust. U.S. Senator Carl Levin warned this week it would create a boom-and-bust cycle in the market The July 18 letter from fabricators said copper stored by the ETFs would represent some 63 percent of London Metal Exchange (LME) and COMEX stocks in the United States and would lead to inflated prices and a disruption in supply and flow of metal. The SEC will decide on Thursday whether to extend the consultation period by another 45 days or give its approval for NYSE Arca to list the first such U.S. product on its exchange. JPMorgan filed its first SEC documents to launch the fund in October 2010. If it gets approval, the U.S. bank would need to file a final registration document with the SEC before it can start marketing and selling the product. A spokesperson for JPMorgan did not respond to requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment due to a regulatory quiet period. Opponents of the funds have focused on the impact on North American end users because most of the 180,000 tonnes of metal which will be used as physical collateral against the shares in the two funds will likely be bought in the United States, where the metal is cheapest. JPMorgan’s first filing said the fund would store LME brand-approved copper valued at up to $499,761,150 - equivalent to roughly 62,000 tonnes based on a copper price of $8,000 a tonne. BlackRock has proposed a physical ETF to be run by its BlackRock Asset Management International unit and called iShares Copper Trust, which would use up to 121,200 tonnes of copper as collateral against shares in a fund. Those tonnages combined are insignificant in a 20 million tonne global market, but they have worried U.S. fabricators, who are the main end users of the red metal, because it accounts for the majority of metal available in U.S.-based exchange-bonded warehouses. Fabricators rely on annual contracts for most of their supply of raw material, but they may have to increase purchases if there is a pick-up in demand should the economy improve, the letter states. That metal would likely come from exchanged-registered warehouses, which may not be available if the funds are given the green light. The NYSE Arca has defended JPM’s plans saying concerns it will cause a bubble that may be vulnerable to bursting is “speculative and misplaced”, noting the small size of the funds’ collateral relative to the global market.

The New York-based investment firm has added eight executives to its global executive committee, bringing the total to 21, according to an internal memo provided by the company to Reuters. BlackRock is replacing its portfolio management group, which had been headed by Rich Kushel, with five new investment groups. Kushel will be deputy chief operating officer of the firm, reporting to President Robert Kapito and chief operating officer Charles Hallac. Kushel will also head a new strategic product management group, according to the memo. The changes come as BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink shifts the $3.56 trillion company’s focus from being an acquirer to operating its businesses. In recent months, amidst a spate of high profile departures and rumors that Fink may leave to become U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, some analysts have said they wanted more insight into the firm’s bench strength. Others wondered if the firm had gotten so big, that it needed more leaders at the top. The changes seem to address those concerns. The additions to the global executive committee “will ensure a broader, more diverse representation of views, including from the investment side of the business,” Fink wrote in the memo. In the memo, Fink indicated that he is not going anywhere. “I look forward to working with all of you in the years to come to realize the full potential of this reorganization,” he wrote. The new portfolio management group structure comes as BlackRock is working to improve performance, particularly of its equity funds. BlackRock will have five new investment groups: Alpha Strategies reporting to Quintin Price; Beta Strategies, which includes all of firm’s passive investments such as exchange-traded funds, and will be led by Amy Schioldager; Multi Asset Strategies reporting to Ken Kroner; Alternative Strategies reporting to Matt Botein; and Trading and Liquidity Strategies reporting to Richie Prager. In its July 18 earnings call with analysts, Fink was not happy with the performance of BlackRock’s fundamental equity managers. “We still are not hitting as well as we need to,” he said. “We are working towards building that platform up and making sure those issues are addressed.” On the client facing front, BlackRock is bringing together its iShares ETF business with its retail mutual fund business, and the firm’s institutional with its BlackRock Solutions business, which includes its risk analytics. The retail and ETF group will report to Rob Fairbairn while the institutional group will report to Rob Goldstein, according to the memo. It makes sense for BlackRock to combine its retail fund sales effort with its iShares sales effort so that advisers will have one point of contact with the firm, said Dave Nadig, director of research at IndexUniverse, which researches ETFs. “The interesting thing will be to see how they bring that sales process together,” he said, noting that on one hand BlackRock has actively managed mutual funds and on the other it has passively managed ETFs.

According to Consob filings, the New-York based investment firm bought 5.03 percent of Unipol capital on July 30 outside of the capital increase of the insurer. Unipol agreed in January to rescue Fondiaria in a complex deal involving a four-way merger and a series of capital increases to create Italy’s No. 2 insurance group. As part of the operation Unipol launched a rights issue worth 1.1 billion euros, some of which was not subscribed. Newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore said on Wednesday the banks guaranteeing the capital increases in the planned merger would sound out investors in coming weeks to sell part of unexercised rights or buy stakes the banks will end up holding. The newspaper mentioned Blackrock. The Consob filings also said Norges Bank held a 2 percent stake in Milano Assicurazioni which is controlled by Fondiaria.

274,BLK,RPT-CORRECTED-BlackRock hires Putnam's Geer for stock fund push,"(Corrects paragraph 6 to show that Bob Doll was chief equity strategist and a portfolio manager instead of chief investment officer) * Geer leaving Putnam’s $3.5 bln Equity Income Fund * Fund beat 87 pct of peers over past 10 years * BlackRock’s Fink: “not hitting as well as we need to” BOSTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc has hired veteran fund manager Bartlett R. Geer away from Putnam Investments, part of a push to build up its actively managed equities team. Geer, who steered Putnam’s $3.5 billion Equity Income Fund  to top-tier performance over 12 years, will join BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager, in September, spokeswoman Jessica Greaney said. Geer’s hiring is aimed at improving New York-based BlackRock’s somewhat struggling active equity team that Chief Executive Laurence Fink has promised to bolster. And Geer’s specialty, dividend-paying stocks, is one of the few hot equity categories among investors. Geer will join the company’s “fundamental equity” team as a managing director, Greaney said. Geer could not be reached immediately for comment on Monday. Putnam Equity Income Fund has done well measured against other large-cap value funds, according to Morningstar, finishing in the top 30 percent of the category in three of four years through 2011. Over the past 10 years, Geer’s fund has outperformed 87 percent of its peers, Morningstar said. BlackRock CEO Fink has already made some moves to revamp the company’s stockpicking group. T hese include replacing portfolio manager Bo b Doll, once the chief equity strategist, b r inging in new portfolio managers, and vowing to improve performance. Fundamental equity is an area where “we still are not hitting as well as we need to,” Fink told analysts on the company’s quarterly conference call July 18. Equity Income Fund was roughly tied with Putnam’s Voyager Fund at the end of July as the second-largest Putnam fund, according to Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. The largest fund at Putnam, part of Canada’s Power Financial Corp , is the Growth & Income Fund, with $4.3 billion at July 31, according to Lipper. Putnam, based in Boston, said Darren Jaroch had replaced Geer on the Equity Income Fund. Jaroch, who joined Putnam in 1999, has been a long-time portfolio manager of Putnam International Value Fund, which ranked in the top 7 percent in its Lipper category over the past three years.

278,BLK,UPDATE 1-BlackRock picked its battles in fierce proxy season,"* Backed Citigroup, JPMorgan, but dissented elsewhere * BlackRock’s Edkins: ‘a high threshold for voting no on pay’ By Ross Kerber BOSTON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Funds run by BlackRock Inc  went along with management during high-profile proxy contests at JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, new filings show, limiting gains by dissident shareholders during the noisy spring proxy season. But even as funds of New York-based BlackRock voted for the status quo at the banks, they dissented in other fights such as at Walt Disney Co and Simon Property Group.  BlackRock funds also raised the stakes when rejecting executive pay plans by adding votes “against” individual directors, unlike some rival funds. As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock’s votes matter to the outcome of many corporate elections, which have taken on a new edge since the financial crisis. T his week’s filings, though they came months after the votes, provide the first detailed look at the company’s overall approach in practice. With $1.6 trillion of equity assets, out of $3.6 trillion in total, BlackRock potentially can sway a close proxy battle. BlackRock’s approach “is not carpet-bombing, it’s more smart-bombing,” said Robert McCormick, chief policy officer for Glass, Lewis & Co., which advises institutional investors on proxy votes. “They’re focusing their ire on the real outliers,” he said. BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink told companies at the start of the year his firm was “willing to support unconventional approaches” to governance so long as they serve shareholders. Though final tallies are not available, votes shown in filings this week suggest BlackRock often gave executives the benefit of the doubt. For instance, filings show one of its largest funds, the $52.6 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund., and others voted with management at Citigroup to approve the pay of named executives like CEO Vikram Pandit. At Citigroup’s meeting on April 17 just 45 percent of stock was voted to back Pandit’s 2011 pay of $15 million, a surprise that showed investors in a fighting mood. The notion was reinforced the next month when 40 percent of JPMorgan shares were voted in support of a union-sponsored measure to strip Chief Executive Jamie Dimon of the additional title of chairman. BlackRock Global Allocation voted against the measure at JPMorgan, however, and supported JPMorgan’s pay plan. B ut BlackRock’s less-frequent votes against individual board members like those who sit on compensation committees can be even more powerful, said Paul Hodgson, chief research analyst at gov ernance research fir m GMI Ratings. The so-called “Say on Pay” votes now required by financial reforms are only advisory, while directors who lose elections often must step down. “It is far more effective,” Hodgson said of BlackRock’s strategy to link its dissenting votes. Like other fund companies, BlackRock would not make executives available to be interviewed about the votes. Under Fink, BlackRock has put much effort into beefing up its governance efforts and has a staff of more than 20 specialists reviewing the practices of companies in which it holds stock. According to its annual report on governance, BlackRock aims for its funds to vote consistently and to take “a universal view,” which would make votes filed to date representative. Often BlackRock voted to back big companies under fire on pay. A ccording to the filing, and a tally compiled by Los Angeles consulting firm Semler Brossy, of the 10 largest companies that failed to gain a majority of shareholder support on pay this year, Global Allocation voted with management in three cases and recorded no votes in six other cases, where it likely did not own shares. But Global Allocation did break with management at one other company on the list, and bared its teeth. The fund vote against pay at Simon Property Group, the world’s largest real estate firm, joining 73 percent of shares voted against management at its May 17 meeting amid anger at a $120 million retention award given its chief executive. The BlackRock fund also voted “against” four directors, each on the compensation committee.  Simon Property leaders did not return messages. Disney was another large company where the BlackRock fund voted “against” executive pay, and voted against compensation committee members. At its meeting on March 13, 57 percent of shares voted were in support of Disney’s pay plan. BlackRock proxy voting is overseen by Michelle Edkins, head of corporate governance. She declined to comment. In a previous interview late last year, Edkins said it maintained “a high threshold for voting no on pay” since when it does so, it also votes against responsible compensation committee members.

CIC, China’s $482 billion sovereign wealth fund, bought a 3 percent stake in BlackRock for $1 billion in 2009, the report said. It has been gradually cutting down its holding in recent months, generating profits on the sales, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter. CIC bought the BlackRock stake at a discount to its then trading price of $178.50, the report said. The stock closed at $176.37 on Friday, valuing the company at $30.5 billion. CIC reported its first fall in net profit in 2011 earlier this year. It doubled its investment in private equity, direct investments and hedge funds to 43 percent of its portfolio last year. BlackRock and CIC are still on course to jointly launch a China-focused fund, expected to be running by the end of this year or early next year, the report added. A CIC spokeswoman in Beijing was not available for immediate comment, while an external public relations company for BlackRock in Hong Kong declined comment.",9032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cic-blackrock/cic-sells-most-of-its-blackrock-stake-ft-idUSL4E8K30IO20120903
283,BLK,"BlackRock stock undervalued even if ETF fees cut, analyst says","(Reuters) - Shares of BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, are undervalued by about 20 percent even if the firm has to cut fees on its popular iShares line of exchange-traded funds, according to an analyst report issued on Wednesday. New York-based BlackRock has been losing ETF market share to lower-priced funds from Vanguard Group for several years. Chief Executive Laurence Fink said in July that BlackRock had a plan in the works to combat Vanguard but provided no details. The most likely move would be targeted price cuts on ETFs that face direct competition from Vanguard, Bernstein research analyst Luke Montgomery wrote in a report on Wednesday. Cuts of that magnitude could reduce BlackRock’s future earnings per share by about 3 percent to 7 percent, Montgomery said. But BlackRock could still attract enough customers to its funds to increase assets under management by up to 1 percent a year, making the stock worth about 20 percent more than the current price of close to $177, he said. “We maintain our Market-Perform rating, but conclude the potential impact of ETF price cuts is not significant enough by itself to justify the discount in the stock,” Montgomery concluded. BlackRock would need to trade at a 30 percent discount to be rated ‘outperform,’ under Bernstein’s typical criteria, Montgomery said. Shares of BlackRock gained 35 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $177.28 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

285,BLK,FEATURE-Investors cash-in on land deals as US housing picks up,"* BlackRock, Paulson, Starwood Capital, Hillwood have invested * Buyers are beginning to resell shovel-ready lots to homebuilders * Return on investments are topping 20 percent By Katya Wachtel NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - From the outskirts of Las Vegas to the coast of California, stretches of undeveloped land in some of the most depressed housing markets in the U.S. are in high demand. Money managers such as BlackRock Inc, hedge fund Angelo Gordon & Co and real estate investment firm Starwood Capital, are beginning to cash-in on so-called shovel-ready residential land-tracts with most of the pre-construction and zoning approvals already in place. The investors snapped up land on the cheap in bankruptcy proceedings, from cash-strapped home developers and banks that seized the properties after foreclosing on them when builders ran out of money. Now they are re-selling the land, often for returns of more than 20 percent on their initial investment, in the latest sign of a modest recovery in the U.S. housing market. Other investors, meanwhile, are looking to partner with homebuilders to develop the tracts. Some, like Paulson & Co, which has also been active in the space, will hold onto the land for sometime before re-selling it to buyers. “We are coming out of the mother of all housing cycles, and residential land is the best way to play the ultimate recovery,” said Michael Barr, a Paulson & Co portfolio manager, who oversees the Paulson Real Estate Recovery fund, which has under $500 million in assets for the $19.5 billion hedge fund. “Land is the highest returning component of the home building equation.” Single-family home sales in the U.S. rose 3.6 percent in July, matching a two-year high achieved in April. In July, applications for building permits hit the highest level since August 2008. Foreclosures are also slowing in many regions. And, the market for existing single-family home rentals has gotten so hot that institutional investors are racing to raise money to buy foreclosed homes from the nation’s banks and then rent them out. But shovel-ready land is a potentially more lucrative way to bet on a housing recovery - though investors may require a good deal of patience because it could take several years for developers to build new homes in some of the areas hit hardest during the financial crisis. “These returns are back-end loaded, and more of an opportunistic, higher risk strategy,” said Dale Gruen, a senior portfolio manager for BlackRock Real Estate, which has raised a fund that invests in such lots. “Single family rental is one in which returns are a more moderate.” Land that already has all the planning permissions required to begin construction is seen as a better bet than sites without all the boxes ticked because the process of gaining those approvals from local, state and federal agencies can take years, and is also a costly procedure. Investors and real estate analysts do caution that a full-blown housing recovery is still some time off. “The housing market is getting better but we’re not quite there yet,” said Stephen Malpezzi, an economist at housing data company Zillow and a professor at the University of Wisconsin’s Department of Real Estate and Urban Land Economics. “We all get excited when we see a few months of positive numbers, but we are still in the middle” of a fragile period for the housing sector, he said. Still, Paulson’s Barr says it is only a matter of time before the market fully ripens. “We think there is going to be a land shortage coming out of the downturn.” The Paulson real estate fund, which launched in 2010 and required investors to lock-up their money for 10 years, currently owns about 25,000 home sites in Florida, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and California, all of which were acquired through some form of distressed sale. Recently, Paulson, whose flagship fund has struggled mightily in the past two years, scooped up 875 acres of land in a resort development called Lake Las Vegas in Henderson, Nevada, for $17 million. Located about 30 miles from Las Vegas, the resort developer filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The acquisition adds about 3,500 home sites to Paulson’s real estate portfolio. DIRT-CHEAP DIRT The Paulson fund, whose founder John Paulson rose to fame and fortune by betting on the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, got into this market in 2010. Hillwood Development and Starwood got into the market even earlier. But new entrants are joining the hunt all the time given the ability to still buy land with development approval for as little as 30 cents on the dollar. For instance, McRae Group of Companies, a Scottsdale Arizona-based real estate firm is pitching potential investors on a fund that will invest in such land projects in the Phoenix metro area, according to a marketing brochure. BlackRock, which manages $3.56 trillion in assets, raised $120 million for a fund that invests in shovel-ready properties, buying up land in the San Francisco area, Orange County, Calif., West Palm Beach, Fla. and northern Virginia. The fund, which finished making investments in June, is now in the process of selling assets back to homebuilders. A person familiar with the fund said the typical return on these types of properties ranges from 20 percent to 35 percent, depending on the strategy and market. Blackrock’s Gruen declined to comment on future investments, but a person familiar with the situation said the firm is considering raising money for a new fund. There is a rebound in the market for shovel-ready land in the Las Vegas region, said Laus Abdo, executive director of Las Vegas-based TriArchic Advisors, a real estate investment and advisory firm.  “Prices have gone from $20,000 a finished lot 18 months ago, to $30,000 - $45,000 per lot today in places like Las Vegas,” Abdo said. Ross Perot Jr’s Dallas-based investment firm, Hillwood Development, is one early buyer of land now cashing in on its bet thanks to signs of a revival in housing markets in Nevada, California, Texas and Florida. During the recession, Hillwood bought shovel-ready land from cash strapped home builders. In one instance, the firm purchased a portfolio of 8,700 undeveloped home lots in 2008, which has on average tripled in value. Fred Balda, the president of Hillwood Communities, said its assets in Las Vegas have proven to be particularly profitable. Balda said that the strategy overall has been “extremely successful”, but some portfolios, such as those containing land in Reno, Nevada, are still struggling, highlighting the local nature of the U.S housing market and the uneven nature of the recovery. Still, many national home builders are flexing their muscles again. Jeffrey Metzger, CEO of KB Home, said in June that the company is “aggressively reinvesting in new land assets and communities.” Similarly, Lennar said it spent $287 million on land and land development in the second quarter, up 74 percent from a year earlier. The proof of that new building activity can be seen on the ground in places like Las Vegas as well. Earlier this year, driving through new residential real estate developments in North-West Las Vegas in May, TriArchic’s Abdo pointed to rows of shiny new signs of all the major U.S homebuilders, from Lennar to Beazer Homes and DR Horton. It’s evidence, he said, of a housing recovery starting to get its legs. “The engine is cranking back up here in Vegas,” Abdo said.",9102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/land-us-housing/feature-investors-cash-in-on-land-deals-as-us-housing-picks-up-idUSL1E8HI5WN20120910
286,BLK,"BlackRock raises S&P; 500 target, but says rally over","NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), one of the world’s largest asset managers, has raised its expectations for the U.S. stock market in 2012 but believes this year’s equity rally has run its course, according to targets provided by the firm on Tuesday. The Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX will finish 2012 at 1,450 and rise to 1,525 by mid-2013, according to Chris Leavy, BlackRock's chief investment officer, fundamental equities of the Americas. The new targets are up from the firm’s earlier forecasts and reflect a 7 percent rally in the benchmark index since early August. Earlier, the firm projected the S&P; 500 would finish the year at 1,350 and rise to 1,400 by mid-2013. BlackRock provided the targets to Reuters, which is releasing its broad global equity poll on Wednesday. The firm had assets under management of about $3.56 trillion on June 30, including $297 billion in equities under management. Late Tuesday afternoon, the S&P; 500 was down 0.5 percent at around 1,450, where BlackRock says it will finish the year, but 4.8 percent below its target for mid-2013. The index reversed earlier gains around midday after BlackRock updated its targets. The new targets are the first from Leavy, who took over management of the firm’s large-cap series funds in June from Bob Doll, the firm’s chief equity strategist. Doll, a 30-year industry veteran, is in the process of retiring from the firm. Leavy has already taken over responsibility for the firm’s large-cap series funds.

289,BLK,"U.S. copper users lodge last appeal against ""devastating"" ETFs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. copper consumers have lodged a last-ditch effort to block government approval of new physically backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), warning they would have a “devastating” effect on prices and supply. In a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late on Thursday, the final day for public comments on one of two proposed ETFs, a lawyer representing the copper users said BlackRock Inc. (BLK.N) had not provided enough evidence to allay fears that the fund would squeeze the global market. “As we have demonstrated, the removal from the market of as much as 180,000 metric tons...would have a devastating impact on both near-term price and supply,” Robert Bernstein, attorney for Vandenberg & Feliu, said in the letter, referring to the amount of copper expected to be used as initial collateral for the ETF. It was the latest volley in a two-year battle over the new funds, which would effectively allow U.S. retail investors to trade physical copper easily for the first time. The SEC has until January 18 to make a decision on the XF Physical Copper Trust proposed by JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which was submitted prior to the BlackRock ETF. That decision is likely to set the precedent for BlackRock’s fund, The regulators could also decide to extend the consultation process for a second time. “Given the controversy, the amount of empirical data they need to review and the opportunities afforded to market participants to give oral presentations, I’d be surprised if they reached a decision before the end of the year,” Bernstein said in a telephone interview on Thursday. His letter sought a meeting with the SEC after October 10 A spokeswoman for JPM did not respond to requests for comment. Spokeswomen for BlackRock and the SEC declined to comment. Bernstein represents a consortium of U.S. copper fabricators - SouthWire Co., Encore Wire Corp, Luvata and AmRod - as well as Red Kite, a large hedge fund and physical trader. The consortium has opposed the funds in a series of filings and meetings with the SEC since May. While 180,000 metric tonnes (198,416 tons) is only a tiny part of a 20-million-tonne global market, fabricators worry that it accounts for the majority of the metal available in exchange-bonded warehouses. They argue there is not enough metal available outside of the exchange networks for immediate delivery to prevent a squeeze in supply because it is tied up in long-term contracts. The long-running dispute has divided traditional industrial consumers who use copper in everything from air conditioning units to cars from banks looking to attract investors seeking exposure to the potentially lucrative copper market. In July, U.S. Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said the funds would cause a boom-and-bust cycle in the copper market. But JPM and BlackRock say those fears are unfounded because the funds will be miniscule compared with the global market. Emphasis on exchange stocks as a measure of the spot metal availability has been overdone, they say. In a letter dated September 12 to the SEC, BlackRock managing director Ira Shapiro noted that exchange stocks are only a small portion of the 1.4 million tonnes of high-grade liquid inventory available around the world. “The grounds on which the (SEC) has been urged to deny (the fund) do not have merit,” he wrote. The ETF would sell investors shares in a fund backed by physical metal as collateral. JPM and Blackrock have said this would make it easier for smaller investors to get exposure to copper prices, which have more than doubled in seven years. JPM’s fund would store LME brand-approved copper valued at up to $499,761,150 — equivalent to about 62,000 tonnes based on a copper price of $8,000 per metric tonne, while BlackRock’s iShares Copper Trust would use up to 121,200 tonnes of copper as guarantee against shares in its fund.

295,BLK,"Spain, U.S. fiscal cliff may spark market correction: BlackRock's Fink","TOKYO (Reuters) - Investors should brace for three or four months of jittery markets due to uncertainty over support for Spain and the looming “fiscal cliff” threatening the United States economy, BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink said in an interview on Saturday. Fink, head of the world’s largest money manager overseeing $3.6 trillion in assets, said he was still bullish on U.S. equities but warned that the stock market could lose 5 to 10 percent in a correction in the final months of the year. “The next three to four months we are going to probably have greater uncertainty and the market may test itself one more time,” Fink told Reuters during a trip to Tokyo, host to this week’s semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Behind those jitters is uncertainty over when and how Spain, the latest epicenter of the euro zone debt crisis, might seek financial aid as it struggles with a huge budget gap, soaring debts and the need to reform its economy, Fink said. But for all of the troubles facing Europe, Fink said just as much time was spent at the IMF meetings talking about the so-called fiscal cliff of expiring tax cuts and looming spending cuts that will hit the U.S. economy early next year unless congress acts. Failure to come up with a solution could knock U.S. gross domestic product in the first quarter to a 3 percent annual rate of contraction, Fink estimated, based on the current run rate of 2 percent annual growth. That risk is already hurting the economy with CEOs reining in spending and reluctant to hire workers, he said. On the other hand, a solution could trigger a substantial rally in equities and set the stage for a stronger economy, underpinned by a recovering housing market and a banking system now sound due in part to post-crisis reforms, he said. Fink dismissed the notion that New York-based BlackRock, whose assets under management are equal to the size of the German economy, may struggle to continue delivering growth. While BlackRock will not pursue large acquisitions, it is considering a couple of “fill-in” deals, he said, adding that one would be similar to its purchase earlier this year of Claymore Investments Inc, a Canadian provider of exchange traded funds (ETFs). Fink also pointed to the potential for growth in actively managed funds, where it is still smaller than a handful of its rivals, while it wants to boost its business providing institutional clients with “solutions” that address specific investment requirements. Fink said 62 percent of his company’s clients are currently only turning to BlackRock to manage one product. “Just think if I could expand that mindshare and help my clients and now have two products with 62 percent of my clients.” One of Fink’s biggest challenges is to fend off the advance of rival Vanguard Group, which has been chipping away at BlackRock’s 40 percent share of the $1.2 trillion U.S. ETF market by offering lower fees. BlackRock said a month ago that it plans to cut fees on some of its core iShares ETFs. Fink said he would be unveiling a strategy for bolstering its ETF business on Monday, two days before the company is due to announce third-quarter results, but did not elaborate on the contents of Monday’s announcement. Earlier this year, BlackRock unveiled an overhaul of its management structure that expanded its global executive committee to 21 from 13. Worries have mounted about the strength of BlackRock’s management bench amid persistent speculation that Fink may be a candidate to replace U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner if President Barack Obama is re-elected. Fink said he was not giving the prospect much thought. “Unfortunately for my life right now my future is being discussed more than I’m thinking about it,” he said. “I expect to be here, I want to be here, I intend to be here for many more years.” Succession scenarios for Fink and other senior positions were discussed at an annual board retreat last week to take stock of the company’s talent pool and identify future leaders, Fink said. “I leave the room when they talk about me. That’s between the head of HR and the board,” he said.

Barron’s said BlackRock has been improving its equity-fund performance and it is working on a new strategy that could involve fee cuts in ETFs, which are poised to grow 12 percent annually to 2025.",10142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-shares/blackrock-shares-undervalued-barrons-idUSL1E8LE10020121014
298,BLK,"UPDATE 2-BlackRock slashes some ETF fees, offers cheaper options","* New emerging markets ETF undercuts Vanguard * Firm cuts fees on six exchange-traded funds * BlackRock introduces four new ETFs By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Monday it is slashing fees on six of its exchange-traded funds and introducing four new ETFs. The firm’s new ETFs include the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, which costs 0.18 percent, far less than the firm’s existing iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, which costs 0.67 percent and will still be available to investors. The most significant fee cut on an existing ETF is on BlackRock’s $362.5 million iShares Core S&P; Total U.S. Stock Market ETF, where fees are being trimmed from 0.20 percent to 0.07 percent. Of its largest ETFs, the most notable cut is in the $15.72 billion iShares Core Total U.S. Bond Market ETF from 0.20 percent to 0.08 percent, undercutting competitor Vanguard Group’s comparable ETF, the $17.6 billion Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF, which costs .10 percent. Exchange-traded funds are baskets of securities like mutual funds, but they trade throughout the day on exchanges like individual securities. BlackRock’s move comes as low-cost competitor Vanguard Group  has gained market share from BlackRock and competitor Charles Schwab Corp has slashed fees on some of its ETFs, in some cases to pennies. Vanguard spokesman John Woerth said these new fee reductions can be attributed to “the Vanguard effect,” of lowering costs in a product category or a market in which Vanguard competes. Last month, Vanguard’s incoming chief investment officer Tim Buckley told Reuters that if competitors cut costs, they should expect Vanguard to cut even further. [ID: nL1E8KSKJT] But BlackRock’s decision to introduce a new, broader emerging markets ETF, instead of cutting fees on its existing $37.3 billion iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund  surprised some analysts. “This lets BlackRock have an incredibly cheap emerging markets ETF in the marketplace, but not cannibalize these sticky assets in a heavily-traded fund,” said Dave Nadig, director of research at IndexUniverse. BlackRock has cut fees on a total of six ETFs: the iShares Core S&P; Total U.S.Stock Market ETF, the IShares Core S&P; 500 ETF, the iShares Core S&P; Mid-Cap ETF, the iShares Core S&P; Small Cap ETF, the iShares Core Total U.S. Bond Market ETF and the iShares Core Short-Term U.S. Bond ETF. The iShares Core S&P; Total U.S. Stock Market will have a new ticker, ITOT, effective  Oct. 17. That is also when the new fees take effect. The firm also changed the index for the iShares Core Long-Term U.S. Bond ETF to the Barclays US Long Government/Credit Bond Index from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Corporate & Government Index. Meanwhile, on Oct. 22 the firm is introducing four new ETFs - three international ETFs and one short-term bond ETF. The most notable of the new funds is the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, which costs 0.18 percent, below Vanguard’s similar ETF, the Vanguard $57.4 MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund , which costs 0.20 percent, and well below its existing emerging markets ETF, which costs 0.67 percent. BlackRock decided to introduce a new emerging markets ETF, rather than cut fees on its existing ETF because it believes there is a strong following among institutional investors for this fund, the firm said in a statement. “We believe EEM offers value to institutional investors with sophisticated and dynamic strategies, who tell us they use it frequently as a vehicle to execute specific investment trades,” the firm said in its statement. Meanwhile, the new ETF, the iShares Emerging Markets Equity ETF, may be better for long-term, buy and hold investors who are more price sensitive, the firm said. “BlackRock understand they have been playing in a different game and they are now focusing more on retail investors,” said Lucas Montgomery, an analyst at Bernstein Research. VANGUARD’s VWO VERSUS iSHARES EEM By keeping EEM’s fees in place, BlackRock is betting there will be an institutional following, particularly after Vanguard announced earlier this month that it would switch 22 of its index funds away from benchmarks provided by MSCI Inc. The change affects Vanguard’s $57.4 billion MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund. Most institutional investors are required to stick to investment mandates that track certain indexes. The battle for assets between Vanguard’s VWO and iShares’ EEM has long been watched by industry experts and analysts, who say they will look on with interest to see how this new fund fares. Vanguard’s VWO, which has fees one-third that of the iShares competitor, has gained $39.9 billion in the past three years, as of Sept. 30, BlackRock’s EEM has seen $2.22 billion in investor money leave over the same period, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. The iShares ETF also has underperformed the Vanguard ETF for the past one and three years, although the five year performance is identical, according to Lipper. But by launching a new ETF instead of cutting fees on EEM, BlackRock can minimize revenue losses, said Tim Strauts, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. BlackRock expects the fee cuts to trim revenues by $35 million to $45 million annually. Cutting fees on EEM could have losses more than three times that amount, analysts said. The challenge for BlackRock may be in how to market two similar ETFs to different audiences. “I think its going to be strange for iShares to talk about emerging markets and have two ETFs that are very similar with dramatically different fees,” Strauts added.",10152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-etffees/update-2-blackrock-slashes-some-etf-fees-offers-cheaper-options-idUSL1E8LFK0620121015

300,BLK,"BlackRock, MSCI shares rise on ETF fee cut plan","(Reuters) - Shares of market index provider MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) jumped 6 percent on Tuesday, a day after a big customer, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), said it was cutting fees on just a handful of exchange-traded funds and none tracking MSCI benchmarks. Shares of BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, rose about 2 percent as analysts said fee reductions at its iShares line of ETFs would have less impact on the New York firm’s bottom line than they had anticipated. MSCI shares had dropped as much as 30 percent on October 2, when another major client, Vanguard Group, said it was dumping MSCI indexes from 22 of its largest funds to save money, prompting speculation that BlackRock might make a similar move. Vanguard said it was switching to indexes with cheaper licensing fees from FTSE Group and the University of Chicago’s Center for Research in Security Prices. MSCI has grown rapidly, thanks to licensing fees paid by ETF fund managers, like BlackRock and Vanguard. The fund companies pay MSCI to track its indexes at rates calculated as a small percentage of each fund’s assets. BlackRock had warned for weeks it would reduce fees on some of its most profitable funds to better compete with rivals like Vanguard and Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). But on Monday afternoon, it announced it would cut fees on only six of its iShares funds, fewer than analysts had expected, and would create four new low-cost funds, including three using MSCI indexes. BlackRock offers more than 600 iShares ETFs. Under the plan, the fee on the iShares Core S&P; Total U.S. Stock Market ETF, for example, will drop to 7 basis points - or 7 hundredths of a percentage point - from the current 20 basis points. The fee cuts will lead to an annual revenue loss of $35 million to $40 million and reduce earnings per share by less than 1 percent, Luke Montgomery, an analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a report. “This is well below our base estimate,” he said. New York-based MSCI, a leading provider of indexes, risk management advice and other investment analysis services, competes with Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO)(TRI.N) in some areas. Until Vanguard’s move a few weeks ago, investors believed that MSCI, best known for its all-world and emerging market stock indexes, would be immune from price wars in the $1.5 trillion global exchange-traded fund market. MSCI shares gained $1.57, or 6.1 percent, to $27.16 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Monday’s close, MSCI shares had lost 22 percent this year. BlackRock gained $4.32, or 2.3 percent, to $189.69 on the New York Stock Exchange. It hit a session high of $190.87. BlackRock shares are up 7 percent in 2012 through Monday, trailing the 15 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. With some $3.6 trillion in total assets under management at the end of June, BlackRock is the largest money manager in the world.

The New York-based company fired on almost all cylinders during the quarter, also showing strength in bond mutual funds, its Lifepath funds for 401(k)-type retirement accounts, hedge fund performance fees and risk management services. The results highlighted the firm’s breadth of offerings built and acquired by Chief Executive Laurence Fink over the past two decades. Fink said customers dealing with market volatility and uncertainty gravitated to BlackRock products. “BlackRock was built for these times, to be responsive to our clients, to helping our clients overcome the uncertainty around all these big macro issues,” Fink said on a conference call with analysts. He pointed to record quarterly flows into iShares since BlackRock acquired the business in 2009 and the highest flow into retail bond funds in more than 10 years. Net income for the third quarter totaled $642 million, or $3.65 per share, compared with $595 million, or $3.23 per share, a year earlier, BlackRock said. BlackRock slightly exceeded Wall Street expectations on two key metrics closely followed by investors, analysts said. Earnings per share, excluding some one-time items and deferred compensation costs, jumped 23 percent from a year ago to $3.47.  Analysts, on average, expected $3.31, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. BlackRock’s profit margin adjusted for the same items hit 40.7 percent, up 1.5 percentage points from a year earlier. “Enough moving parts as always but earnings, (assets under management) and flows are growing,” Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in an initial report on the earnings. “The stock is still attractive in our view.” Overall, investors withdrew $43 billion from BlackRock’s long-term funds and accounts. Excluding $74 billion an institution withdrew from an indexed bond account, BlackRock took in $31 billion from investors. That included a record $25 billion going into iShares funds, with more than three-quarters flowing into stock ETFs, $6 billion into retail bond funds and $10 billion into funds aimed at 401(k)-type defined contribution retirement accounts. BlackRock declined to name the client that moved to competitors and sought to play down the impact, with CEO Fink describing the lost business as “one of our lowest fee products.” The firm lost $36 billion from a similar one-client move in the first quarter. “I am not going to chase business for window dressing my (assets under management) as some of our competitors are certainly doing,” Fink said. “It does not make economic sense in this case.” BlackRock also saw institutional customers withdraw $2.9 billion from its higher-fee alternative investments and $5 billion from actively managed stocks. Analyst Craig Siegenthaler at Credit Suisse said he was cutting his 2013 earnings per share estimate for BlackRock by 14 cents to $14.52 due in part to “weaker flows in high fee businesses.” Total assets under management at BlackRock hit $3.67 trillion, up 3 percent during the quarter and up 10 percent from a year ago. The strong quarter for iShares came despite competition from lower-cost competitors in the United States like Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp. On Monday, BlackRock unveiled a plan to cut fees on six iShares funds and introduce four new low-cost funds. The fee reductions could reduce BlackRock’s annual revenue by $35 million to $40 million, BlackRock President Robert Kapito said on the call with analysts. But growth produced by the four new ETFs could overtake the losses, he said. “We expect to see incremental flows that will over time more than offset potential revenue impacts,” Kapito said. BlackRock’s fee cuts followed ETF price reductions by Schwab last month as well as Vanguard’s announcement on Oct. 2 that it was switching to lower cost index providers on 22 of its largest ETFs, likely as a prelude to reducing fees. But Vanguard’s decision to switch away from leading index provider MSCI to lesser known competitors is prompting some investors to switch to BlackRock funds, which still track MSCI indexes, Fink said. Vanguard denied that the index change was having a negative effect on its ETF flows. “Vanguard’s planned benchmark changes and the future associated cost savings have been very well-received by our clients,” spokesman John Woerth said. “Vanguard is leading the U.S. ETF industry with $41 billion in net cash inflow through September and our momentum continues unabated in October.” BlackRock’s Fink took pains to deny that the industry was engaging in a price war. “We have got to move on from this myth about a price war,” Fink said in his most heated remarks on the 90-minute call. “We had our healthiest quarter. We are very optimistic about where we are.” Overall, third-quarter revenue at BlackRock rose 4 percent from a year earlier to $2.3 billion. Performance fees jumped 12 percent to $103 million on strong gains at BlackRock’s hedge funds and other accounts that garner a portion of profits based on their investing track records. Revenue from risk management advice and other services at its BlackRock Solution unit rose 9 percent to $128 million. Shares of BlackRock closed down 84 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $189.13 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

That included a record $25 billion going into iShares funds, with more than three-quarters flowing into stock ETFs, $6 billion into retail bond funds and $10 billion into funds aimed at 401(k)-type defined contribution retirement accounts. BlackRock declined to name the client that moved to competitors and sought to play down the impact, with CEO Fink describing the lost business as “one of our lowest fee products.” The firm lost $36 billion from a similar one-client move in the first quarter. “I am not going to chase business for window dressing my (assets under management) as some of our competitors are certainly doing,” Fink said. “It does not make economic sense in this case.” Total assets under management at BlackRock hit $3.67 trillion, up 3 percent during the quarter and up 10 percent from a year ago. The strong quarter for iShares came despite competition from lower-cost competitors in the United States like Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). On Monday, BlackRock unveiled a plan to cut fees on six iShares funds and introduce four new low-cost funds. The fee reductions could reduce BlackRock’s annual revenue by $35 million to $40 million, BlackRock President Robert Kapito said on the call with analysts. But growth produced by the four new ETFs could overtake the losses, he said. “We expect to see incremental flows that will over time more than offset potential revenue impacts,” Kapito said. BlackRock’s fee cuts followed ETF price reductions by Schwab last month as well as Vanguard’s announcement on October 2 that it was switching to lower cost index providers on 22 of its largest ETFs, likely as a prelude to reducing fees. But Vanguard’s decision to switch away from leading index provider MSCI (MSCI.N) to lesser known competitors is prompting some investors to switch to BlackRock funds, which still track MSCI indexes, Fink said. Vanguard denied that the index change was having a negative effect on its ETF flows. “Vanguard’s planned benchmark changes and the future associated cost savings have been very well-received by our clients,” spokesman John Woerth said. “Vanguard is leading the U.S. ETF industry with $41 billion in net cash inflow through September and our momentum continues unabated in October.” BlackRock’s Fink took pains to deny that the industry was engaging in a price war. “We have got to move on from this myth about a price war,” Fink said in his most heated remarks on the 90-minute call. “We had our healthiest quarter. We are very optimistic about where we are.” Overall, third-quarter revenue at BlackRock rose 4 percent from a year earlier to $2.3 billion. Performance fees jumped 12 percent to $103 million on strong gains at BlackRock’s hedge funds and other accounts that garner a portion of profits based on their investing track records. Revenue from risk management advice and other services at its BlackRock Solution unit rose 9 percent to $128 million. Shares of BlackRock were down 17 cents at $189.80 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The shares had gained 7 percent so far this year through Tuesday's close, trailing the 16 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX.

313,BLK,Exclusive: Credit Suisse to sell European ETF business - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG MLPN.P has put its $17.2 billion European exchange-traded fund business up for sale, according to sources familiar with the matter. BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and State Street Global Advisors, the asset management arm of State Street Corp (STT.N), are among the firms that have bid for the business, three of the sources said. The first round of bids was due in early October and the investment banking arm of Credit Suisse is representing its parent company on the deal, they said. With 58 ETFs, Credit Suisse is the fourth-largest ETF provider in Europe, with 5.6 percent market share as of September 30, according to ETFGI, a London-based ETF research firm. BlackRock is the largest ETF provider in Europe, with more than 40 percent of the $309 billion European ETF market. Its 192 European iShares ETFs had $126 billion in assets. State Street’s 41 SPDR ETFs in Europe had $3 billion in assets, making up just 1 percent of the European market. Credit Suisse’s decision to sell its ETF business comes as the firm is closing or reducing other parts of its business to raise capital to meet new regulatory requirements. Earlier this year, the firm said it was accelerating cuts in some of its asset management operations. Spokeswomen from Credit Suisse, BlackRock and State Street declined to comment. For BlackRock, the addition of Credit Suisse’s ETF business would be the second international ETF business the firm has made this year.

315,BLK,"BlackRock, others in talks on money market compromise","NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Officials from BlackRock Inc, Fidelity Investments and other mutual fund operators are meeting Friday with U.S. regulators to discuss a potential compromise for reform of the $2.5 trillion money market industry. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, and Fidelity, the largest manager of money market funds, had opposed a prior proposal from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro to make the funds more stable in times of financial crisis. But renewed pressure from regulators since Schapiro’s plan died in August have stimulated another effort to find a compromise. The meetings are with officials from the SEC and the U.S. Treasury Department to discuss what they see as an “industry supported solution,” BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink said Friday in an interview on CNBC. Regulators are concerned that fund investors may grow panicky during a crisis, sparking a run of withdrawals from the industry and freezing a significant source of lending across the economy, as happened in 2008. The industry proposal appeared to focus on giving funds the ability to discourage withdrawals during times of crisis. Recently, BlackRock publicly proposed a plan to charge investors an extra fee to withdraw their money whenever a fund was under stress, discouraging hasty departures. And the fee would go back into the fund, encouraging others to stay put. Schapiro’s earlier efforts offered the industry two options. Funds could abandon their fixed $1 per share net asset value and offer a floating share price, like most other types of mutual funds. Or, they would have to maintain capital against losses while forbidding full withdrawals by customers during a crisis. The new industry plan does not include a floating share price or capital buffers, according to a person involved in the process who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are still private. The industry considered the earlier proposals as too expensive and likely to drive away investors, money fund analyst Peter Crane, who runs the cranedata.com website, said. Still, companies would prefer to settle the dispute rather than have the debate drag on and annoy fund investors. “It’s like settling a lawsuit,” he said. “You’re probably going to win, but it’s going to be a costly fight.” Representatives from most of the 10 largest money fund managers attended the talks on Friday, reflecting a broader group of top firms than in similar meetings held in May, the person involved in the process said. In May, BlackRock, Vanguard Group and others sought a compromise, but Fidelity did not participate in those efforts. Vanguard also attended Friday’s talks. “Vanguard has been very engaged in the industry’s discussions regarding additional money fund reform,” spokesman John Woerth said. The fund industry’s primary trade group in Washington, the Investment Company Institute, said current talks should expand on reforms the SEC passed in 2010 with industry backing which tightened credit standards for fund investments, the group said. “ICI and the fund industry are engaging directly with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a united effort to constructively build on the success of the 2010 reforms,” the ICI said in a statement. Fidelity spokesman Vin Loporchio confirmed that Fidelity representatives were attending Friday’s talks. He declined to comment on details of the meetings. The SEC declined to comment and calls to the Treasury Department were not immediately returned. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase, the second-largest U.S. money fund manager, declined to comment. Regulators started looking at money market funds in September 2008 after the Reserve Primary Fund, one of the largest money funds at the time, suffered losses on Lehman Brothers debt and could not maintain its $1 per share net asset value, an event known as “breaking the buck.” The event ignited a run of withdrawals from investors across the industry, forcing the government to step in and back the funds. In August, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the federal multi-agency regulator established by the Dodd-Frank reform act to oversee financial risk, took up money market reform after Schapiro said she did not have enough backing from her fellow SEC commissioners to advance her proposed reforms. A letter from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner last month offering potential reforms stimulated further talks, according to Christopher Donahue, chief executive of Federated Investors, the third-largest manager of U.S. money funds. “Constructive dialogue continues,” he said on Friday on a call with analysts. The company declined to comment on whether it attended Friday’s meeting. Several money market fund providers said they were unhappy that news of the meeting was made public. The leak is “counterproductive” to the negotiations, according to one executive at a money market fund firm who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions. Under its recent public proposal, BlackRock said money market funds, which typically have 30 percent of their holdings in assets that can be converted to cash within five days, would be frozen if liquidity fell to 7.5 percent. At that time, investors wanting to pull money out of the funds would have to pay a fee that would go back into the fund, according to a September paper published by BlackRock outlining the proposal.

Under its recent public proposal, BlackRock said money market funds, which typically have 30 percent of their holdings in assets that can be converted to cash within five days, would be frozen if liquidity fell to 7.5 percent. At that time, investors wanting to pull money out of the funds would have to pay a fee that would go back into the fund, according to a September paper published by BlackRock outlining the proposal.

324,BLK,"BlackRock says China, U.S. to power commodities markets","SYDNEY (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest money manager, downplayed the impact of Europe’s financial woes on commodities markets on Tuesday, and said robust Chinese demand and an improving U.S. economy will support growth. “The U.S. has been a big surprise to the upside, not of the order of Chinese GDP growth numbers... but it is much better than many people had expected at the beginning of the year,” Catherine Raw, co-manager of BlackRock’s BGF World Mining Fund told reporters on a media call on Tuesday. “The euro zone crisis, at least for the moment seems less of a concern,” Raw said. BlackRock manages about $3.67 trillion of funds across equity, fixed income, cash management and other sectors, while its BGF fund manages $11 billion of mining stocks. BGF’s biggest holdings include Rio Tinto (RIO.AX) (RIO.L), which makes up 9.3 percent of the fund, and BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) (BLT.L), which makes up 8 percent, according to a September 30 entry on the company’s website. Raw said the outlook for copper was promising due to a general decline in the number of copper mines supplying global markets and a recovering housing market in the United States. She said BlackRock was overweight in iron ore companies — which include Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton — and forecast a long-term price of around $120 a metric ton (1.1023 tons). That is in line with a median estimate price forecast of $120 a metric ton, based on a Thomson Reuters poll of 12 analysts.[ID:nL3E8LT25H] and near the current spot price..IO62-CNI=SI “The share prices today, we believe, are factoring in a pessimistic outlook, one in which commodity prices are going to average lower than what we see today,” Raw said. “From our point of view, this creates a huge amount of value and a huge amount of opportunity.” BlackRock also manages Australia-listed fund Global Mining Investments GMI.AX, whose top three holdings are BHP, commodities trader Glencore (GLEN.L) and Rio Tinto. GMI’s portfolio underperformed its benchmark, the HSBC Global Mining Index, in the September quarter, returning 3 percent compared with a 6 percent rise in the benchmark. Copper prices last week fell 2.4 percent in their largest weekly fall in four months, while a 15 percent rise in iron ore prices over the last month could be running out of steam as restocking of inventories comes to an end, according to some analysts. But Raw said fortunes of mining companies could be turning up as long as China’s economy continues to grow and a recovery in the U.S. takes hold.

333,BLK,Former BlackRock strategist Bob Doll joins Nuveen,"(Reuters) - Money manager Nuveen Asset Management on Monday hired Bob Doll as chief equity strategist and senior portfolio manager, just a week after Doll announced he was retiring from a similar role at rival BlackRock. The move brings a well-known stock picker to Chicago-based Nuveen, which is seeking to raise its profile with investors and financial advisers and possibly go public in 2013. Doll, who makes regular appearances on financial television networks, is known for his bullish views on stocks and annual list of 10 market predictions. “For years, advisors have followed Bob’s views on the market with great interest as they seek to construct quality, long-term portfolios for their clients,” David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen, said in a statement. “We are pleased that we will be able to bring that expertise to the market and our clients.” Nuveen, with $117 billion under management, is a unit of Nuveen Investments, taken private in a 2007 leveraged buyout by Madison Dearborn Partners.

At Nuveen, Doll will co-manage the approximately $1.5 billion Nuveen Stable Growth strategy, including its corresponding mutual fund, starting December 10, spokeswoman Kathleen Cardoza said. The firm also plans to seed several new large-cap equity funds based on Doll’s investment process, she said. Last week, BlackRock said Doll was retiring.

336,BLK,BlackRock to tap infrastructure debt demand,"LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - BlackRock aims to lend clients’ money to European infrastructure projects, as it seeks to tap rising investor demand for railways and roads and fill a financing gap left by retreating banks. The world’s largest asset manager said on Monday it is to launch a European infrastructure debt division that will lend   to companies in sectors such as transportation and regulated utilities. Infrastructure investments are increasingly popular among pension and sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies keen for stable, inflation-linked returns. Research firm Preqin said $14 billion was raised by infrastructure funds during the three months to end-September, an increase of 33 percent over the previous quarter. At the same time, governments are also keen to get more pension fund cash flowing into infrastructure projects, especially as capital-starved banks pull back from investing in major schemes. The UK government, for example, is considering allowing local authority pension schemes to double the amount they can legally invest in infrastructure. BlackRock has hired a team of three - Philippe Benaroya and Chris Wrenn, who will co-head the division, and Gilles Lengaigne - from rival Blackstone to run the new business from London. “Investors are looking for increased yield, and to exploit new investment opportunities resulting from global deleveraging,” Matthew Botein, Head of BlackRock Alternative Investors, said in a statement. A number of institutional investors have sought to beef up their infrastructure offerings this year. Aviva Investors told Reuters last month it is preparing to launch a range of funds to invest in infrastructure products.",11262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-infrastructure-debt/blackrock-to-tap-infrastructure-debt-demand-idUSL5E8MQ82T20121126

338,BLK,U.S. may be next hot spot for infrastructure debt investments,"* BlackRock will consider U.S. next year * TCW’s Rivelle cites “global search for yield” By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - As asset management firms like BlackRock Inc and Allianz Global Investors introduce global infrastructure debt investments in Europe, they are eyeing other markets. And some say that the U.S. may be a logical next step. On Monday New York-based BlackRock announced it launched a European infrastructure debt division that will lend to companies in sectors such as transportation and regulated utilities. In Europe, high-yielding infrastructure loans have been traditionally owned by banks. However, those banks are retreating from this area due to the regulatory environment. At the same time, institutional clients, such as pensions and insurance companies, are searching for higher yields. That is why BlackRock sees an opportunity, said Chris Wrenn, the new co-head of European infrastructure debt at BlackRock. In general, BlackRock anticipates the yield on infrastructure debt to outperform U.S. Treasuries by around 2.50 to 3 percentage points. “Investors in this low interest-rate environment are looking for safe, stable assets that can produce good long-term returns,” Wrenn said. That demand is not isolated to Europe. Institutional investors in the U.S. have also expressed interest in these projects through private placements, said Philippe Benaroya, who heads the new group with Wrenn, after working at BlackStone/GSO. As there are more infrastructure deals resulting from public/private partnerships, the U.S. may become an attractive market for asset managers, said Deborah Zurkow, managing director head of infrastructure debt in the London office of Allianz Global Investors. “It is certainly one of several geographies we will look at,” Zurkow said. BlackRock will take a closer look at the U.S. market in the first quarter of next year, but for now it is focused on getting its European business up and running, Benaroya said. BlackRock’s new team, which also includes Gilles Lengaigne, who was also hired from BlackStone, is eyeing transportation and social infrastructure projects in northern and Western Europe. “The focus here is on senior debt of investment grade quality,” Benaroya said. The firm will initially focus on European clients who want customized managed account offerings. Clients outside of Europe who are interested may also invest, Benaroya said. It makes sense that asset managers are looking to expand their presence in infrastructure debt, said Tad Rivelle, Chief Investment Officer for fixed income at TCW, a Los Angeles based asset manager with $135 billion in assets under management. With most fixed income securities, yields “are starting to hit a wall,” Rivelle said speaking at the Reuters 2013 Investment Outlook Summit on Tuesday in New York. “What they are seeing is perhaps what everyone else is seeing in that many of the fixed-income markets are reaching saturation levels in terms of the yield level,” Rivelle told Reuters. “What’s happening, of course, is that the conditions in the capital markets and the Fed’s policies are driving the capital into a global search for yield.” TCW has no plans currently to invest in global infrastructure debt, Rivelle said.

News of the BlackRock sales come after a terrible two years for the former FTSE 100 company. Man suffered a fifth straight month of client exits in October after poor returns from its flagship AHL fund. Its shares have halved since late last year. In an effort to reverse its fortunes, the company has made a raft of changes: slashing costs, launching new funds and naming Jonathan Sorrell, son of WPP (WPP.L) boss Martin Sorrell, as finance director. Shares in Man closed down 1.95 percent at 75.9 pence on Tuesday.

345,BLK,"HP, RIM take flak from nervous financial industry customers","NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co and BlackRock Inc voiced concerns about Hewlett-Packard Co and Research In Motion Ltd this week, saying business and operational struggles may affect the reliability of two of the biggest technology service providers. “We are concerned about some of the players that we have relied on to provide material services and equipment,” Scott Condron, chief technology officer of asset management giant BlackRock, said at an information technology conference in New York sponsored by Waters magazine. Hewlett-Packard is BlackRock’s preferred provider for its server farms and a major vendor for its personal computers. “I like their equipment and I would like them to continue being a supplier, but I need them to be a better company,” Condron said in an interview. Richard Anfang, chief information officer at JPMorgan Chase’s securities services division, also referenced HP’s problems as a risk factor banks should consider in dealing with suppliers. “You really want to understand what your reliance on vendors is and how that puts delivery service at risk,” he said at the conference. “Where do you have single points of failure, where do they not have resiliency - everything from a Verizon central office switch flooding during the hurricane to accounting scandals with HP.

HP said in November that a UK software company it bought last year for more than $11 billion cooked its books prior to the acquisition, requiring an $8.8 billion write-down in its third quarter. That followed a write-down of almost $11 billion on its EDS services division in the second quarter. An HP spokesman declined to comment on the JPMorgan and BlackRock remarks. In August, an HP press release touted BlackRock’s upgrade of an investment management application delivery platform that it said would automate daily testing and reduce testing time for certain applications to hours from days. BlackRock’s Condron lauded Research In Motion’s Blackberry, which is his firm’s default-issued smartphone, as “still the best enterprise platform” for internal communications but expressed concern about the company’s health. “I would like them to be a preferred supplier but am afraid they might not be here,” he said at the conference. “They are faltering.

350,BLK,Power grid expansion to boost infrastructure groups -BlackRock,"* German strategy shift to trigger infrastructure spending * Sees oil price in $90-120 range next year By Christoph Steitz FRANKFURT, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The need for power grid expansion will be a boon for infrastructure companies in the coming years, according to fund managers at BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager. “We are very bullish on energy infrastructure,” Alastair Bishop told Reuters. “The need for investments in the area of energy infrastructure will be one of the clearest themes in the next three years and beyond.” Bishop is a member of BlackRock’s Natural Resources Equity team, which, among others, manages the BGF World Energy  and BGF New Energy funds. Rising investments for energy infrastructure have already attracted companies such as U.S.-based Quanta Services, which installs and maintains infrastructure for electric and gas utilities, one of the top holdings in the New Energy fund. The New Energy fund — a fifth of which is invested in stocks in the area of renewable energy and infrastructure — also holds shares in power transmission firm ITC Holdings . Billions of euros of investments are needed to build, expand and maintain existing power grids in the next decades, above all in Europe’s top economy Germany, which last year decided to pull out of nuclear energy. A study by Deutsche Energie Agentur (Dena) released on Tuesday suggested that up to 42.5 billion euros ($55.3 billion) of investment is required on distribution infrastructure until 2030. To also benefit from companies active in the oil sector, BlackRock’s $3-billion World Energy fund has put a heavy focus on exploration and production firms, with a strong overweight in this area compared to its benchmark, the MSCI World Energy NR . The fund counts oil heavyweights Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil and BP among its top holdings but manager Robin Batchelor said uncertainty over oil prices would continue to dominate the sector next year. “There are many moving parts, for example Iran, where it is unclear how production will develop next year,” Batchelor, who is also joint chief investment officer of BlackRock’s Natural Resources Equity team, said. Iran, one of the world’s largest oil suppliers, on Wednesday said it would prefer OPEC adopt a much lower 28-million barrel-a-day oil output target but was happy for now to back an unchanged cartel target of 30 million bpd. Due to ongoing uncertainty over supply and demand next year, Batchelor said he expects Brent crude oil prices to move in a range of $90-120 per barrel next year, compared with a current $109.

353,BLK,BlackRock offers money fund compromise proposal,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, offered a detailed plan on Thursday to break a deadlock with regulators over tightening rules on the $2.6 trillion U.S. money market fund industry. Regulators have been seeking to tighten rules on money funds in the wake of the financial crisis, when problems at one fund spooked investors and sparked a run of withdrawals that threatened to destabilize the economy. But the industry has so far successfully defeated the plans by arguing that the new rules would make the funds too expensive to run and unappealing to customers. Under BlackRock’s proposal, money funds would maintain a constant net asset value in times of market turmoil by imposing a fee of 1 percent on customer withdrawals. The so-called stand-by liquidity fees would go back into to the funds to bolster their share price. New York-based BlackRock included the proposal in a 26-page letter to regulators. BlackRock also said it opposed the latest reform options offered by the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council last month. Those options relied on either ending the industry’s fixed $1-per-share pricing policy or requiring funds to set aside capital against future losses. Although BlackRock has indicated a willingness to compromise in the past, most of the money fund industry, including leading companies like Fidelity Investments and Federated Investors Inc, have long opposed floating share prices and capital requirements.

357,BLK,SEC delays ruling on BlackRock copper ETF till February,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators have delayed by two months a ruling on BlackRock Inc’s plan to launch a copper exchange-traded fund backed by physical metal, a week after giving the go-ahead to a similar product proposed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission set a new and final deadline of February 22 to rule on the BlackRock fund. It said it needed more time to consider the issues surrounding the iShares Copper Trust, which along with JPMorgan’s fund has ignited fears among copper fabricators about their impact on prices and supplies. The postponement comes just a week after the SEC gave the green light to JPMorgan’s fund, saying it did not believe it would disrupt the availability of the metal. That decision was seen as a benchmark for BlackRock’s product. The SEC followed a similar path with JPMorgan, waiting to rule until the final deadline in order to investigate claims by copper fabricators that by hoarding more than 180,000 tonnes of copper off the market, the funds would inflate prices and tighten supplies. There is one final regulatory hurdle that JPMorgan must cross before it can launch its product - it must file a prospectus for the product with the SEC. Copper end users who have launched a strenuous attack on the products may challenge the ruling in federal court. Robert Bernstein, an attorney with the law firm Eaton & Van Winkle LLP, who is representing a consortium of fabricators, said he will decide whether to appeal the ruling on the JPMorgan XF Physical Copper Trust once he has analyzed the SEC’s findings. “I think there are grounds to appeal,” he said in an interview on Monday. Bernstein has until February 18 - 60 days after the ruling’s publication in the Federal Register on December 20 - to file a legal challenge, he said. The end users say the removal of up to 183,000 tonnes of copper, which would be used as collateral against shares in the funds, would have a “devastating” effect on the market. The BlackRock and JPMorgan products are very similar, although BlackRock’s is twice as large. JPMorgan’s fund would store LME brand-approved copper valued at up to $499,761,150 - equivalent to about 62,000 tonnes based on a copper price of $8,000 per tonne.

The end users say the removal of up to 183,000 tonnes of copper, which would be used as collateral against shares in the funds, would have a “devastating” effect on the market. BlackRock’s proposed fund is double the size of JPMorgan’s. JPMorgan’s fund would store LME brand-approved copper valued at up to $499,761,150 - equivalent to about 62,000 tonnes based on a copper price of $8,000 per tonne. BlackRock’s iShares Copper Trust would use up to 121,200 tonnes of copper as guarantee against shares in its fund.",12242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-fund-copper/sec-delays-ruling-on-blackrock-copper-etf-until-february-idUSL1E8NO18S20121224
360,BLK,BlackRock beat Vanguard in 2012 U.S. ETF customer inflows,"Jan 7 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s U.S. iShares exchange-traded funds took in $61 billion from customers in 2012, winning the top spot from Vanguard Group in a record-breaking year. Investors added $191 billion to U.S.-listed ETFs in total last year, breaking the previous record of $169 billion in 2008, according to fund researcher Morningstar. Ranking second, Vanguard received $53 billion from customers, while third-place State Street garnered $40 billion. Overall assets in U.S. ETFs hit $1.35 trillion, or about 13 percent of all the money invested in long-term U.S. funds, Morningstar said. Growing competition among top ETF providers prompted managers to cut fees across the industry last year. In October, BlackRock rolled out a new line of lower-fee “core” funds to combat low-fee funds from Vanguard and Charles Schwab Corp. BlackRock’s new line grabbed about one-quarter of all customer inflows to its ETFs since being announced, Morningstar said. Among other ETF managers, Invesco’s PowerShares unit placed fourth with $8 billion of inflows and bond giant Pimco ranked fifth with $5 billion. The Pimco Total Return ETF , an actively managed fund run by Bill Gross, was the most successful new fund of 2012, bringing in almost $4 billion.",1072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/funds-etf/blackrock-beat-vanguard-in-2012-u-s-etf-customer-inflows-idUSL1E9C745F20130107
361,BLK,UPDATE 1-Former BlackRock energy fund manager joins hedge fund GRT,"BOSTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager GRT Capital Partners said it has hired former BlackRock fund manager Daniel Rice to lead its energy investment strategy. At GRT, Rice will oversee about $400 million for institutional investors, the Boston-based firm said in a statement on Tuesday. Rice will manage both long-only and long/short accounts, GRT said. Rice stepped down as co-manager of the BlackRock Energy & Resources Fund in June after the disclosure of a potential conflict of interest that involved his family business and holdings in the fund. Energy stocks have lagged almost every other sector over the past year as weaker-than-expected demand and slackening global growth hurt prices. Rice, however, sounded upbeat on the sector on Tuesday. “The industry has weathered last year’s ‘Black Swan’ winter, and energy stocks are poised to begin reflecting improved fundamentals,” Rice said in a statement. At BlackRock, Rice’s fund posted middling performance over his last three years, according to data from Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. The fund gained an average of 6.88 percent a year for the three years ended June 30, 2012, placing 16th out of 31 energy funds, Lipper said. But the fund did post an outstanding year in 2009, gaining 76 percent on successful bets that coal and natural resource stocks would recover strongly from the financial crisis of 2008. GRT was founded in 2001 by two managers who left Fidelity Investments, Greg Fraser and Tim Krochuk, along with Rudy Kluiber of State Street Management and Research. Rice managed energy funds at State Street Management before it was acquired by BlackRock in 2005. At State Street, Rice had worked with Kluiber, who ran the well-known Aurora Small Cap Value fund before leaving to start GRT, a spokeswoman for GRT said. ž",1082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/hedgefunds-rice/update-1-former-blackrock-energy-fund-manager-joins-hedge-fund-grt-idUSL1E9C88U120130108
362,BLK,Exclusive: BlackRock to buy Credit Suisse's European ETFs - source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc has won the bidding for Credit Suisse Group AG’s European exchange-traded fund business, according to a source familiar with the situation. The deal is expected to be announced shortly, said the source, who declined to be identified because the deal is not yet public. The value of the deal could not be determined. A BlackRock spokeswoman and a Credit Suisse spokeswoman declined to comment. Credit Suisse put its $17.6 billion ETF unit up for sale in October, sources told Reuters at the time. In November, Credit Suisse said it was integrating its private banking and asset management divisions into a new wealth management unit. BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, the asset management arm of State Street Corp, were among the companies bidding for the business, but State Street dropped out of the bidding in December. Credit Suisse is the fourth largest ETF provider in Europe, with 58 ETFs and a 5.3 percent market share as of December 31, according to ETFGI, a London-based ETF research firm. BlackRock is the largest ETF provider in Europe, with more than 42 percent of the $331 billion European ETF market. Its 202 European iShares ETFs had $139.6 billion in assets as of December 31, the research firm said. Credit Suisse’s ETF business would be the second international ETF business BlackRock has acquired in the past several months. BlackRock bought Toronto-based Claymore Investments, a Canadian ETF operation, from Guggenheim Partners LLC, in March. “This acquisition shows BlackRock’s further commitment to being the dominant player in ETFs in every market they are in,” said Dave Nadig, director of research at IndexUniverse LLC, a San Francisco-based firm that tracks ETFs.

364,BLK,UPDATE 1-Copper users ask SEC to reverse copper ETF ruling,"* SEC ruling ‘arbitrary and capricious’ - letter * Takes fabricators step closer to legal challenge * JPM’s commodities chief met with SEC a week before approval * SEC’s ruling on BlackRock due Feb. 22 Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. copper users criticized U.S. regulators as “arbitrary and capricious” and requested they reverse their ruling in favor of JPMorgan Chase & Co’s  controversial plan for a copper exchange-traded fund. The letter, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by a group representing half the U.S. demand for copper, could delay the ETF launch further and be the last step before a court challenge of the SEC’s ruling. The fabricators in their Jan. 9 letter said the SEC had not presented enough evidence to show the fund would not distort supply and prices of the metal used widely in plumbing and cooling systems. “It appears the commission categorically rejected all of the substantial evidence presented as to the catastrophic damage that the proposed (fund) could have for industrial users of copper,” Robert Bernstein, an attorney with the law firm Eaton & Van Winkle LLP, who is representing the consortium of fabricators, said in the letter. While the SEC is not obligated to respond to the consortium’s latest filing, the issues are the same as those to be considered by the SEC in its ruling on BlackRock Inc’s  similar fund due on Feb. 22. If the commission doesn’t reconsider, Bernstein has until Feb. 18 - 60 days after the ruling’s publication in the Federal Register on Dec. 20 - to take his case to federal appeals court. “We haven’t made up our mind yet, but we certainly laid the groundwork to do that,” Bernstein said in an interview on Thursday. Legal action could further frustrate JPMorgan’s efforts to launch the fund, more than two years after it first filed for approval. The filing came on the deadline set by the SEC for interested parties to respond to its Dec. 14 ruling giving the go-ahead for the JPM XF Physical Copper Trust. JPMorgan declined to comment, but in giving the green light, the SEC said it did not believe the fund would affect supplies of metal for immediate delivery. The U.S. bank has much riding on the launch as the big banks that swept into trading commodities over the past decade look for new ways to make money in the wake of the world financial crisis and amid tighter regulations. With frantic work going on behind the scenes, the bank’s commodities chief Blythe Masters met with outgoing SEC chairman Mary Schapiro and her successor Elisse Walter on Dec. 6, a week before receiving the green light, according to an SEC memorandum. Masters has built the bank’s commodities business from scratch in just five years. Under her watch, the bank bought Sempra which gave it a preeminent franchise in oil and metals trading, as well as one of the world’s biggest metals warehousing companies, UK-based Henry Bath. The company’s facilities in the United States and Asia would be used for storing the metal used to back the first ETF of its kind. Bernstein said on Thursday he found news of the meeting “very disturbing.” The consortium - SouthWire Co, Encore Wire Corp, Luvata and AmRod - as well as Red Kite, a large hedge fund and physical trader, have fought hard to get the SEC to block the JPMorgan and BlackRock funds. Industrial users fear it would have a “devastating” affect on the market by disrupting supplies and inflating prices since it will use physical copper cathode as collateral against shares of the fund, effectively removing a chunk of metal from the market. In its defense, JPMorgan and BlackRock say such fears are unfounded because the funds, which would effectively allow U.S. retail investors to trade physical copper easily for the first time, would be miniscule compared with the 20-million-tonne global market. Up to 183,000 tonnes of copper would be taken off the market, according to filings by both companies. The BlackRock iShares Copper Trust and JPMorgan products are very similar, although BlackRock’s is twice as large. JPMorgan’s fund would store LME brand-approved copper valued at up to $499,761,150 - equivalent to about 62,000 tonnes based on a copper price of $8,000 per tonne.

366,BLK,BlackRock to buy Credit Suisse ETF business,"ZURICH (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N) is to buy Credit Suisse’s CSGN.VX exchange-traded fund (ETF) business, which will give the U.S. asset manager greater scale in Europe. The price tag on the deal, announced on Thursday, was not disclosed, but two sources familiar with the matter put it at between $200 million and $300 million. For Credit Suisse, the disposal marks another step to bolster capital in line with tough new requirements on banks after the financial crisis. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager by assets, will increase its scale and distribution with this deal. Credit Suisse is the fourth largest ETF provider in Europe, with 58 ETFs and a 5.3 percent market share as of December 31, according to ETF Global Insight, a London-based ETF research firm. BlackRock is the largest ETF provider in Europe, with more than 42 percent of the $331 billion European ETF market. Its 202 European iShares ETFs had $139.6 billion in assets as of December 31, the research firm said. With the acquisition, BlackRock will have more than a 47 percent market share of the European ETF market, according to ETFGI. Exchange-traded funds are baskets of securities, like mutual funds. But ETFs trade on exchanges, like individual securities, and carry lower fees than mutual funds. Scale is key in ETFs. “The ETF business is generally a low-margin business which needs scale to make it attractive,” said Bank Vontobel analyst Teresa Nielsen. “The acquisition ... represents BlackRock’s continued commitment to the Swiss market and underpins the importance we place on meeting the needs of our clients,” chairman and chief executive Laurence Fink said. The European ETF market is expected to grow substantially in coming years as more financial advisers move from charging commissions toward fee-based businesses, said Deborah Fuhr, founding partner of ETFGI. Fee-based advisers like using ETFs because they are low cost and allow the advisers to maintain a bigger portion of their fees. “The European ETF market is about five or so years behind the U.S. market,” she said. Given the importance of scale in the ETF business, it is likely that there will be more consolidation of ETF providers in coming months, said Luke Montgomery, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “It seems to be headed toward more consolidation given that so many players only have about 5 percent of the assets under management,” he said. Two ETF industry sources said BlackRock was likely paying a premium for the scale and distribution that it would gain from the Credit Suisse business, which they valued at between 150 and 200 million Swiss francs ($162 million - $216 million). “Anyone not in the top three in Europe would be willing to sell their ETF business at the right price,” said one ETF industry source. A source familiar with the situation said that CS’s legal advisers do not expect significant antitrust issues. Credit Suisse put the ETF business, which manages 16 billion Swiss francs in client funds, on the block in July as part of a plan to bolster capital by 15.3 billion francs. This included issuing convertible bonds and selling prime Zurich real estate and other assets. In November, Credit Suisse said it was integrating its private banking and asset management divisions into a new wealth management unit to cut costs. Credit Suisse said the effect of these measures to bolster capital will be detailed in its four quarter earnings on February 7. Credit Suisse’s ETF business is the second international ETF business BlackRock has acquired in the past year after it bought Toronto-based Claymore Investments, a Canadian ETF operation, from Guggenheim Partners LLC, in March.

369,BLK,UPDATE 5-BlackRock profit rises 24 percent on equities demand,"* Q4 EPS $3.93 vs $3.05 year earlier * Adjusted EPS of $3.96 beat Wall St view of $3.73 * Investors added $47 bln to long-term funds * Assets under management totaled $3.8 trillion By Aaron Pressman Jan 17 (Reuters) - BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink may finally be proving to skeptics that he was right to spend $15 billion buying Barclays’ investment business to create the world’s largest money manager. The New York-based firm said Thursday that its fourth-quarter profit increased 24 percent on a 14 percent revenue gain. Investors poured $47 billion into BlackRock long-term funds, including $31 billion into higher-fee stock funds. Shares of BlackRock closed up 4.4 percent at $232, the highest level since shortly after the Barclays deal closed in December 2009. The former Barclays exchange-traded fund unit, iShares, has been a stellar performer all along — it brought in $36 billion of new business alone in the fourth quarter. But investors spent years disappointed with Fink as the rest of the combined firm struggled with performance and integration issues that depressed profits. Now, after overhauling underperforming funds, cleaning up a real estate investing mess and launching a massive branding campaign aimed at individual investors and their advisers, Fink is pleasing investors with expanding profit margins. Shares of BlackRock, which traded for less than $170 during the summer, have gained 24 percent in just the past two months. And Fink is back on the expansion trail, snapping up Credit Suisse’s ETF business last week and opening a new line of cheaper “core” ETFs in the United States in October. “We are seeing proof that the investments we have made in people, products and technology over the past three years are paying off,” the CEO said on a call with analysts. “This quarter we saw positive asset flows across every client channel in every geographic region.” Big money managers make their profits by charging fees as a percentage of assets under management. And because it doesn’t cost the firms much more to manage their portfolios when asset values — and fee revenues — rise, they should show increasing profit margins in bull markets. From 2008 through 2011, however, BlackRock’s annual adjusted profit margin was stuck in range of 38 percent to 39 percent even as stock markets staged one of the biggest recovery rallies in history. Finally, in 2012, Fink’s firm has cracked the 40 percent mark for the year, reaching almost 43 percent for the fourth quarter. With bond yields stuck near historic lows and equity markets surging, investors have begun to shift their money to stock funds after years of sticking with more conservative fixed-income products. That benefited BlackRock and other money managers since fees on stock funds tend to be higher than those on bonds funds. New York-based BlackRock benefited doubly from the strong global equity markets. The MSCI All-Country World Index  gained 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 13.4 percent over the past year, increasing the value of BlackRock’s asset base to a record $3.8 trillion, and encouraging investors to put more money to work in its higher-fee stock funds. Analysts said the results demonstrated that even a firm as large as BlackRock could still post strong growth. Glenn Schorr at Nomura Securities called the results “a pretty darn good quarter,” with customer inflows, revenue and profits all coming in ahead of analyst expectations. “Momentum in asset gathering was very strong, driven by its ETF business,” added analyst Mac Sykes at Gabelli & Co. The fourth-quarter shift toward stocks mainly reflected growing concerns about the riskiness of bonds, CEO Fink said on a call with analysts. Interest rates are so low that an increase of 15 hundredths of a percentage point could wipe out a year of performance gains, Fink said. “What we are seeing is clients understanding the embedded risk at these low interest rates for bonds and now migrating into equities,” Fink said. The trend toward stocks appeared to have accelerated into 2013. Investors added $7.5 billion into U.S.-based equity mutual funds last week, the biggest weekly inflow in 11 years, according to data from Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. “So far this year, we’re seeing strong inflows after a strong fourth quarter,” Fink said on the call. BlackRock’s net income totaled $690 million, or $3.93 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $555 million, or $3.05 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected BlackRock to earn $3.73 per share, excluding certain items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On that basis, BlackRock earned $3.96. As the largest manager of ETFs, BlackRock also benefited from growing investor desire to use the low-cost, index-based funds instead of actively managed funds that have tended to underperform the market in recent years. Of the $47 billion added to BlackRock’s long-term funds, almost $36 billion went into iShares. Investors withdrew $5.4 billion from BlackRock’s actively managed equity funds and $374 million from active bond funds. BlackRock new line of even cheaper “core” iShares ETFs, better positioned to compete with offerings from Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp, attracted $4.6 billion from customers in the quarter.",1172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-results/update-5-blackrock-profit-rises-24-percent-on-equities-demand-idUSL1E9CH2NP20130117

376,BLK,Asset manager BlackRock buys into Man United,"LONDON (Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock (BLK.N) has built a stake of more than 8 percent in the listed shares of British soccer club Manchester United (MANU.N). The U.S. company owns 8.21 percent of the English Premier League club’s Class A shares, listed on the New York Stock Exchange last year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The asset manager has also invested in the Formula One motor racing business. United are seven points clear at the top of the Premier League and have had a good start to the year commercially, signing up a series of sponsorship deals. A report this week by Forbes said that United’s recent share price rise has made it the first professional sports team with a value of more than $3 billion. The club is owned by the American Glazer family. The share listing last August used a dual structure of Class A and B shares, which left the Glazers firmly in control of the club. The shares languished below the initial $14 price for much of last year but have surged in recent weeks to a peak of $17.75. They closed at $16.78 on Wednesday. English soccer clubs will benefit over the next three years from enhanced television deals, while spending should be curbed by European rules punishing clubs that run up big losses.

386,BLK,UPDATE 2-Copper makers challenge U.S. in court over JPMorgan ETF,"* SEC ruling ‘arbitrary and capricious’ - petition * Challenge comes ahead of SEC ruling on BlackRock fund on Feb. 22 * Red Kite, Amrod and Luvata not parties to lawsuit By Josephine Mason NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - U.S. copper makers Southwire Co and Encore Wire Corp are launching a legal challenge against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval of JPMorgan Chase & Co’s physically backed copper exchange traded fund (ETF). The companies, which say the copper ETF will inflate prices for the metal and distort supplies, filed a notice of appeal on Tuesday asking the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. to review the SEC’s Dec. 14 ruling that gave the go ahead for the copper ETF. The companies contend the SEC’s ruling was “arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of direction, or otherwise not in accordance with law or unsupported by substantial evidence,” said the petition signed by their attorney Robert Bernstein with law firm Eaton & Van Winkle LLP. Legal action could further frustrate JPMorgan’s efforts to launch the JPM XF Physical Copper Trust, more than two years after it first filed for approval. It also comes less than two weeks before the U.S regulator decides on another, similar fund, the iShares Copper Trust planned by BlackRock Inc. The ruling is due on Feb. 22. Spokeswomen for JPMorgan and the SEC declined to comment. Southwire, North America’s largest wire and cable maker, and Encore Wire based in McKinney, Texas, will go it alone without three other members of a consortium that tried unsuccessfully to get the regulator to block the fund. Major metals hedge fund and merchant, Red Kite, and two other fabricators Luvata and AmRod are not parties to the appeal, Bernstein told Reuters. After an almost year-long struggle to get the SEC to reject the fund, they may not have the appetite for a protracted and potentially costly legal battle, market participants said. Industrial users fear the funds would cut off supplies of copper, used in electrical wiring and plumbing, and boost prices since they will use physical copper cathode as collateral against shares of the fund, effectively removing a chunk of metal from the market. In their defense, JPMorgan and BlackRock say such fears are unfounded because the funds, which would effectively allow U.S. retail investors to trade physical copper easily for the first time, would be miniscule compared with the 20-million-tonne global market. In giving the green light, the SEC said it did not believe the fund would affect supplies of metal for immediate delivery. The U.S. bank has much riding on the launch as the big banks that swept into trading commodities over the past decade look for new ways to make money in the wake of the world financial crisis and amid tighter regulations.",2122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/etf-copper-jpmorgan/update-2-copper-makers-challenge-u-s-in-court-over-jpmorgan-etf-idUSL1N0BCFVA20130212

389,BLK,"BlackRock to offer ETFs with maturity dates, like bonds","Feb 13 (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s largest manager of exchange-traded funds, will soon release a new series of fixed-income funds that mature after a set number of years, like ordinary bonds. The new ETFs are designed to simplify the task of institutional money managers like bank treasurers, who currently must juggle hundreds or even thousands of distinct bond issues in their portfolios, BlackRock President Robert Kapito said on Wednesday. A single ETF owns a basket of many bonds but trades far more easily on a stock exchange. “I think this will be the biggest product that’s ever hit the fixed income market,” Kapito said, speaking at a Credit Suisse conference in Miami. The new funds will focus on corporate bonds with maturities in 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2023, according to BlackRock filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Each fund will mature, or pay out all of its bond principal, on March 31 of the given year. Management fees will be as little as 0.1 percent of assets. The funds are similar to those of smaller ETF manager Guggenheim Investments, which offers a series of eight corporate bond ETFs that mature from 2013 through 2020 and six high-yield bond ETFs with maturities extending until 2018. Those funds had total assets of almost $2 billion at the end of last year. Most fixed-income ETFs own a basket of bonds but continually buy new ones as current holdings reach maturity. Thus the funds exist in perpetuity. BlackRock’s iShares line of ETFs oversaw $753 billion at the end of 2012, more than any other firm.",2132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-etfs/blackrock-to-offer-etfs-with-maturity-dates-like-bonds-idUSL1N0BD8UU20130213

391,BLK,BlackRock names Morgan Stanley banker Shedlin CFO,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc named Morgan Stanley banker and long-time financial advisor Gary Shedlin as its next chief financial officer, to succeed Ann Marie Petach. Shedlin, who served as advisor to BlackRock on virtually all of its most significant deals, will join the money manager on March 11 and take over as CFO on completion of Petach’s tenure after the company’s first-quarter results, the New York-based firm which oversees nearly $4 trillion said in a statement on Tuesday. Most notably, Shedlin advised on BlackRock’s 2009 purchase of Barclays’ investment business to create the world’s largest money manager. The former Barclays exchange-traded fund unit, iShares, has been a stellar performer and helped the New York-based firm please investors with expanding profit margins. Despite Shedlin’s extensive merger and acquisitions experience, BlackRock said he is not joining to initiate a major round of dealmaking. “Management has been very clear that we’re not going to do any major strategic transactions,” spokesman Brian Beades said. “There is no appetite for those.” The firm will continue to pursue smaller deals to fill in missing components, such as the recent deal to acquire the European exchange-traded fund business of Credit Suisse, Beades said. BlackRock shares, which have risen 28 percent in the past three months, closed on Tuesday down 59 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $238.86. Shedlin is currently vice chairman-investment banking at Morgan Stanley and has previously worked with Citigroup and Lazard Ltd. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Shedlin had decided that after 25 years in investment banking, he wanted to do something new, according to a person familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity. His departure was not related to events at Morgan Stanley, the person said. BlackRock chief executive Laurence Fink and Shedlin have talked about working together for some time, but conversations grew more serious after the retirement vice chairman Susan Wagner last year, the person said. Around that time, Petach had also expressed interest in changing roles. Petach will join the firm’s BlackRock Solutions unit as a senior managing director in the client solutions business and will help develop initiatives with a focus on offerings for public and private pension funds, the company said.

399,BLK,UPDATE 2-US regulator approves BlackRock's copper ETF plan,"* BlackRock could eventually take 121,000 tonnes of copper to back product * BlackRock’s copper ETF pool double the size of rival JPM product By Rujun Shen and Melanie Burton SINGAPORE, Feb 25 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, has won approval from the U.S. securities regulator to list a copper-backed exchange-traded fund, potentially moving ahead of JPMorgan whose listing of a similar product has been delayed by industry objections. The U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission approved a proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the iShares Copper Trust on NYSE Arca, it said on its website (www.sec.gov). The launch of copper ETFs are intended to give large U.S.-based funds easier access to the copper market, but some industrial users worry that such products will remove a large chunk of the metal from the market and inflate prices. “Some of the big U.S. institutions looking at inflation hedges may decide to invest...(but) these ETFS would have to be hugely popular from day one to make a dent in a surplus,” said analyst Robin Bhar of Societe Generale. “It could still be several months before investors are able to purchase shares in the exchange-traded fund. I would not be surprised if there is a legal challenge even to the BlackRock ETF,” he added. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ‘s rival product was approved about two months ago, but it has not yet listed due to objections from some in the copper industry. Any impact on prices is expected to be limited, given slowing demand growth in top consumer China which has taken much of the heat out of commodities prices and as copper supply is expected to exceed demand this year. Analysts expect purchases, at least initially, to be slow. BlackRock’s copper ETF could take up to 121,000 tonnes of copper as guarantee against shares in its fund, while JPMorgan’s fund would store around half that amount, with copper valued at up to $499,761,150 - equivalent to about 62,000 tonnes based on a copper price of $8,000 per tonne. “It is paving ground for (an) artificial spike in copper prices once the proper macro backdrop is in place,” said Dominic Schnider, an analyst at UBS Wealth Management in Singapore. “But right now we are only looking at copper strength related to the cyclical uptick in demand, and I am not sure if that will be enough to motivate investors.” The global market for refined copper is expected to swing into a 281,000-tonne surplus in 2013 from a deficit last year, the International Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) has said, with mine supply growing against a backdrop of tepid demand.",2252013,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-etf-copper/update-2-us-regulator-approves-blackrocks-copper-etf-plan-idUSL4N0BP10E20130225

Rice co-managed the funds with Walsh and Neumann until last June when he stepped down after being criticized for a potential conflict of interest. The possible conflict stemmed from a joint venture between Alpha Natural Resources ANR.N, one of the fund’s top holdings, and a subsidiary of an energy company founded by Rice and run by his sons.

404,BLK,Fidelity expands ETF partnership with BlackRock,"BOSTON, March 13 (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments expanded its 3-year-old partnership with BlackRock Inc to offer its customers free trading of more exchange-traded funds, as the once-dominant mutual fund company strives to catch up in a faster-growing market. Fidelity brokerage customers will be able to trade 65 BlackRock iShares ETFs without paying a commission, up from 30 funds currently, the two firms said on Wednesday. BlackRock will also help Fidelity develop an investment strategy for clients based on a mix of ETFs and will support some of the firm’s own efforts to start a new line of equity sector ETFs. Boston-based Fidelity, which manages some $1.7 trillion mostly in mutual funds, has largely been left behind in the ETF explosion of the past decade. By contrast, BlackRock acquired top ETF provider iShares in 2009. Among its nearly $4 trillion of total assets, it oversees $708 billion of ETFs. Neither BlackRock nor Fidelity would say how many customers have used the free trading program over the past three years or how much money they have invested in iShares funds. New York-based BlackRock pays Fidelity marketing fees for the commission-free ETF transactions as part of the deal. The company said it wanted more access to Fidelity’s millions of brokerage customers and to registered investment advisers who use Fidelity’s platform. “When you’re in a multiyear partnership with the world’s leader, it makes a lot of sense to double down,” said Mark Wiedman, global head of BlackRock’s iShares unit. The move follows Charles Schwab Corp’s announcement last month of a free trading platform for 105 ETFs from six providers but not BlackRock. Participants included State Street Corp, the second-largest manager of ETFs; Invesco’s  PowerShares; and Schwab’s own small ETF lineup. Fidelity’s expanded partnership with BlackRock was not a response to the Schwab offering, said Kathleen Murphy, president of personal investing at the Boston-based firm. “We’ve been proactive from the start,” she said. “We’re not being reactive.” Fidelity manages a single, small ETF but has filed plans with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a line of equity sector funds, including some that would be actively managed instead of passively tracking market indexes. Under Wednesday’s expanded deal, BlackRock will provide support for Fidelity’s passive sector funds, while Fidelity concentrates on the actively managed ETFs, Murphy said. She declined to provide further details.",3132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fidelity-investments-blackrock/fidelity-expands-etf-partnership-with-blackrock-idUSL1N0C528V20130313

BlackRock President Rob Kapito told employees on Monday that despite the layoffs the firm, which oversees almost $4 trillion, would continue hiring and expected to end 2013 with more employees than it currently had. “These moves will give high potential employees greater responsibility and additional career opportunities, and will make us a more agile organization better positioned to respond to changing client and market needs,” Kapito said in the memo. Shares of BlackRock have gained almost 50 percent in the past three months. Investors have been pouring into BlackRock stock and bond funds, especially its iShares lines of exchange-traded funds, helping push its adjusted profit margin over 40 percent. The layoffs follow BlackRock’s reorganization, started last year, to refocus the New York-based firm away from growing through large acquisitions and more by attracting new clients. BlackRock doubled its assets through the 2009 acquisition of the investment unit of London bank Barclays Plc (BARC.L) but Kapito and Chief Executive Laurence Fink have said this year that the firm is done making major purchases. BlackRock employed 10,500 people at the end of 2012, growing by more than 1,500 people since the start of 2010.

I am one of those who believe what Japan is doing, it might be on the right path,” said Fink, who heads the world’s largest asset manager, at the annual Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index .N225 has rallied nearly 44 percent since mid-November on the back of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's aggressive fiscal and monetary expansion campaign to revive the world's third biggest economy.

418,BLK,BlackRock profit jumps 10.5 percent on shift into stock funds,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) first-quarter net income rose 10.5 percent as investors, growing more confident in the economy, gravitated toward stock funds, the world’s largest money manager said on Tuesday. For the first time since the financial crisis struck in 2008, equity funds emerged as the dominant investment vehicle, giving the New York-based company a boost because they are more profitable than bond funds. During the quarter, BlackRock customers added $33.7 billion to equity offerings, representing the lion’s share of $39.4 billion of new flows into long-term funds. Low yields on fixed-income securities and fears that bond investments will lose more value when interest rates eventually rise contributed to the shift, BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink said. He also said that investors globally are getting more confident about U.S. stocks. “One thing that is evident is that economists have miscalculated the robustness of the U.S. economy,” he said in an interview. Even though investors have been pouring money into exchange-traded stock funds and other equity products, Fink hesitated to call the trend “a great rotation” out of less risky bonds. “As investors move back to equities, they’re cautious,” said Fink, who built his career as a bond salesman, in a conference call with analysts. They are trying to balance their need for higher returns at the same time that they are seeking low-risk investments, he said. As a consequence, BlackRock is focusing on adding balanced strategy products that will appeal to an aging population facing low returns from rock-bottom interest rates. Profit margin rose to 40 percent on an adjusted basis from 38.6 percent adjusted one year earlier. BlackRock attributed the jump to strong expense control as well as the higher fees that equity products generate. Shares of BlackRock fell in morning trading but rebounded later in the day. They were up 0.53 percent, or $1.34, at $255.20 in mid-afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 23.5 percent so far this year, surpassing a 10.2 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX. Along with the tilt toward equities, investors withdrew more money than they added to BlackRock’s bond funds, pulling out a net $2.6 billion. They withdrew $2.2 billion from currency funds, while adding $9 billion to multi-asset portfolios and $1.5 billion to core alternative funds. Retail mutual fund assets fell 1 percent from a year earlier to $421.1 billion, representing 11 percent of assets. BlackRock replaced four of its stock fund managers recently, and Fink said it is “committed to improving performance” in its actively managed fund sector. BlackRock is making a particularly big push into exchange-traded funds, an area it entered in 2009 when it bought iShares from Barclays. It is the biggest U.S. provider of ETFs, which made up 22 percent of its assets under management at March 31, and is stepping up sales efforts after losing market share to new competitors that were competing on price. In March, BlackRock expanded a three-year partnership with Fidelity Investments, which now promotes 65 iShares ETFs to its clients without charging a commission. Previously, BlackRock paid Fidelity to list just 30 such funds. Long-term net inflows into iShares have shifted from emerging market products in January and February to broader U.S. market indexes in March and April, particularly large-capitalization ETFs. “If you look at the overall trends, there has been huge investing in U.S. equities as the world started believing in the U.S. economic story,” Fink said in the conference call. He also promoted the firm’s international ETFs, saying investors need to replicate broad returns in global markets that are increasingly integrated. For years, they ignored Japan, but as the country emerges from its long period of deflation, money is pouring into ETFs focused on Japanese securities, he said. The same is true for Mexico-focused funds that reflect that country’s “great economic story.” All told, inflows into stock ETFs accounted for $20.4 billion out of $25.6 billion of all new flows into iShares last quarter, while revenue in the funds climbed 22 percent to $687 million. BlackRock also is creating more hedge fund and other “alternative” investment products to help customers beat average market returns, Fink said. BlackRock oversees more than $1.5 billion of assets in such funds. The firm ended the quarter with record total assets under management of $3.94 trillion, including new money and market gains. BlackRock’s net income rose to $632 million, or $3.62 a share, from $572 million, or $3.14 a share, a year earlier. Excluding costs to launch a closed-end fund, a new compensation plan and other one-time items, earnings were $3.65 a share. On that basis, they beat analysts’ average forecast of $3.58 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In March, BlackRock told its staff it would reduce headcount by nearly 300 employees, or about 3 percent, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters. The cut is part of a reorganization that began last year. In another major cost shift, BlackRock is de-emphasizing its strategy of making large acquisitions and focusing on the more efficient alternative of expanding existing businesses through improved asset management and marketing. Compensation expenses, lifted by severance costs during the quarter, totaled a higher-than-usual 36 percent of total revenue, Chief Financial Officer Ann Marie Petach said in the conference call. Executives, who are selectively adding managers and salespeople, said they expect to end 2013 with more employees than they have today.

422,BLK,Slide in engineering stocks pushes UK's FTSE lower,"* FTSE 100 closes down 0.1 pct at 6,280.62 points * Engineering stocks fall as Caterpillar cuts forecast * Randgold rises as Blackrock increases stake in firm * Logic Investments backs “shorting” into strength By Sudip Kar-Gupta LONDON, April 22 (Reuters) - Britain’s benchmark equity index closed lower on Monday, erasing initial gains after U.S. construction equipment group Caterpillar cut its forecast, hitting British engineering stocks. Traders said the outlook over the next month looked negative for the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, due partly to bearish technical signs and an uncertain global economic outlook. The FTSE 100 ended down 0.1 percent, or 5.97 points lower, at 6,280.62 points. The FTSE is up 6.5 percent since the start of 2013 but has fallen around 4 percent from a 2013 intraday peak of 6,533.99 points in mid-March. The index has also fallen on 9 sessions since the start of April and risen on 6, which traders said pointed to an overall negative picture. “Technically, it’s not looking too great at the moment. The price action doesn’t look too healthy since any rallies are not being sustained and are very short-lived,” said EGR Broking managing director Kyri Kangellaris. Kangellaris said the FTSE could fall back down to 6,000 points “fairly quickly” if any further declines pushed it below 6,200. Engineering and construction stocks such as AMEC, Melrose and Weir featured prominently on the FTSE’s loserboard after Caterpillar cut its 2013 profit forecast. However, gold miner Randgold Resources outperformed to rise 4.4 percent to the top of the FTSE 100, helped by investment company Blackrock’s decision to raise its stake in Randgold to 14.1 percent from around 14 percent before. “The Blackrock news has given it a shot in the arm,” said Securequity sales trader Jawaid Afsar. Darren Easton, director of trading at Logic Investments, said he saw the FTSE 100 trading within a tight range from roughly 6,210-6,380 points in the coming sessions. He added he would rather sell - go short - on any rallies in the market, rather than go long by buying the market on days when it dipped. “Our general preference is to ‘short’ into strength, rather than go ‘long’ into weakness,” he said. Miton fund manager George Godber favoured stocks with positive cash-flow. He added that he did not have any banks, miners or utility stocks in his portfolio but backed stocks such as retailer Sainsbury and housebuilders Barratt Developments and Berkeley Group. “We know there’s money coming out of bonds and into equities, but you’ve got to be selective with your stock-picking,” said Godber, who manages the CF Miton UK Value Opportunities Fund.

Fink noted his New York-based company was the world’s largest holder of bank equity and bank debt, so had to closely follow tighter regulation of the financial industry in the wake of the 2007-09 crisis when governments bailed out many banks. “There is no consistent manner in which bank resolution will be applied,” he said. “It is a mess and we are trying to constructively work with our regulators ...

427,BLK,Former BlackRock fund manager arrested in insider trading probe,"LONDON, May 14 (Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock  said on Tuesday that one of its former employees was arrested in April by City of London police on suspicion of insider dealing. BlackRock did not name the individual but a source with knowledge of the matter said it was Mark Lyttleton, one of the firm’s longest serving British-based fund managers who left the company in March. The source said Lyttleton was one of the people to whom Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority referred on May 3, when it said it had arrested and questioned a man aged 41 and a woman aged 37 on April 30 in West London, in connection with an investigation into insider dealing and market abuse. A second source with knowledge of the matter said the woman who was arrested was Lyttleton’s wife, but did not give her name. The FCA said at the time neither individual was charged and the arrests are not linked to any other ongoing insider dealing investigation. It added that business and private premises in Switzerland were searched by the Swiss authorities in connection with its investigation. “The FCA has informed us that the allegations relate to actions carried out for personal gain, while off our premises, and that neither BlackRock, nor any other employee, is under investigation,” BlackRock said in a statement on Tuesday. “There is no suggestion that there has been any impact to any of BlackRock’s clients.” Britain’s financial watchdog has made several high-profile arrests for insider dealing already this year, as part of a commitment to crack down harder on the crime. BlackRock announced in March Lyttleton would leave the firm at the end of April, although he actually relinquished his fund management responsibilities in March and has not worked at the firm since 28 March. Lyttleton, most recently manager of BlackRock’s UK Dynamic and UK Absolute Alpha funds, traces his career at the firm back more than 20 years. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Lyttleton for comment. BlackRock said on Tuesday it was continuing to help the authorities with their investigations.",5142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-arrest/former-blackrock-fund-manager-arrested-in-insider-trading-probe-idUSL6N0DV37720130514
428,BLK,BlackRock launches cross-border ETF to grow European market,"* Cross-border ETF to be settled in international security depository * Designed to cut transaction costs, boost liquidity LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, plans to issue Europe’s first cross-border exchange-traded fund (ETF) in a move it expects will reduce trading costs and attract more investors to the product. ETFs track baskets of shares, bonds or commodities and are traded like stocks. They offer access to indices without having to buy the underlying securities. At present European ETFs are issued and traded on one or more national stock exchanges. The trades are then settled in the national securities depository of the country in which the trade was executed. If an investor based in one country wants to buy or sell an ETF listed in another, he must have depository accounts in both countries, keep each account updated with any changes in the positions and follow post-trading rules in both jurisdictions. The process can be complex, costly and time-consuming, BlackRock said. BlackRock, which issues over 600 ETFs under the iShares brand, aims to bypass that system by launching an ETF with an international security structure, meaning trades will be settled in one location. It hopes that the simplified structure will be used as a template for further cross-border funds, potentially boosting liquidity, cutting transaction costs and ultimately growing the $220 billion European ETF market, which lags well behind the $1.5 trillion market in the United States. The U.S. already has a single settlement location. “In order for the European ETF market to reach $1 trillion in the next three to five years, the entire market ecosystem must become more efficient for investors,” said Mark Wiedman, global head of iShares. BlackRock is partnering with clearing and settlement firm Euroclear, home to the international central securities depository based in Brussels, to deliver the cross-border ETF that is set for launch in the coming months.",6042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-etf/blackrock-launches-cross-border-etf-to-grow-european-market-idUSL5N0EG1H820130604

431,BLK,BlackRock support for PepsiCo may stymie Peltz call for Mondelez merger,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) said on Thursday it opposes Nelson Peltz’s proposal that PepsiCo Inc PEP.N buy Mondelez International (MDLZ.O) and shed its beverage business, signaling that the activist investor’s proposal could fall flat with fellow investors. “At the moment, I would disagree with him,” Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, said in an interview on CNBC. “I question how it would add long-term value.” Peltz, a PepsiCo shareholder, said on Wednesday he wants PepsiCo to buy the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate for at least $62 billion and spin off PepsiCo’s beverage business - either globally or just in the Americas or North America. PepsiCo has said repeatedly that it sees no need for large deals or splitting off its global drinks business, which includes its name-sake soft drink, Tropicana juice and Gatorade. Fink said BlackRock currently owns 5 percent of PepsiCo. Peltz’s Trian Fund Management has a stake of about $1.3 billion, or less than 1 percent, in PepsiCo, which boasts a market capitalization of more than $131 billion. With such a small stake, Peltz would have to persuade large institutional shareholders to help him bring PepsiCo to the negotiating table, said Henry Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Quality Investing, which owns just under 1 million PepsiCo shares. “I don’t think I’d bet against him,” Smith said. Trian declined to comment. Peltz, who was involved in the breakups of Cadbury Schweppes and Kraft Foods, said his cause may be helped by the fact that 37 of the top 40 PepsiCo shareholders also own Mondelez. It may be easier to woo Mondelez shareholders, said Sandy Villere III, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co, which owns Mondelez shares. “You can have your cake and eat it too,” he said, referring to the growth prospects of Mondelez on its own and any future upside from a deal. PepsiCo may be forced to move toward one of Peltz’s options if he can generate institutional support, said Smith. “But that’s not going to happen in the next few months. That’s a multiple-quarter time frame,” Smith said. PepsiCo shares closed up 1.8 percent at $86.80 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. They have gained 21 percent during the past year, as the company has made progress streamlining its business and improving its performance. Mondelez shares closed up 0.3 percent at $30.58, still well below the $35 to $38 per share price Peltz indicated for an acquisition - a sign that Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar took to mean investors remain skeptical that a deal will be consummated. “Not that many people on the buy side really believe that there’s a ton here. Many on the sell side would love to be involved in such a transaction, but not that many believe it’s going to happen,” said James Tierney, chief investment officer at WP Stewart, which used to own PepsiCo shares. Adding PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay snacks to the large international network Mondelez uses to sell Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies is part of the rationale for the deal, along with cost savings and the greater focus that would come from being just a snack company, following separation of the drinks business. But J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher said the market may not have enough faith in PepsiCo management to pull off such a big deal at this point. Last year was a transition year during which PepsiCo cut thousands of jobs, pruned its portfolio and increased its marketing to reignite growth amid investor frustration at a stagnant stock price and a North American drink business that was losing ground to Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). PepsiCo’s business has improved, but analysts say the company still has more to do. “With neither company operating at full speed at this point, we think adding in massive integration would only exacerbate their problems,” Faucher said, adding that he is skeptical of any deal that involves combining store delivery networks, since disruptions can hurt sales. Of the strategic options laid out in Peltz’s analysis, the one that seems the most likely to occur is the spin-off of the North American beverage business, because the company is already considering options for it. PepsiCo has said repeatedly that it would update the market on that business in early 2014. Coca-Cola has already begun to refranchise some of its U.S. bottler system and analysts have long said they expect similar moves from PepsiCo.

432,BLK,BlackRock support for PepsiCo may stymie Peltz call for Mondelez merger,"NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Thursday it opposes Nelson Peltz’s proposal that PepsiCo Inc  buy Mondelez International and shed its beverage business, signaling that the activist investor’s proposal could fall flat with fellow investors. “At the moment, I would disagree with him,” Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, said in an interview on CNBC. “I question how it would add long-term value.” Peltz, a PepsiCo shareholder, said on Wednesday he wants PepsiCo to buy the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate for at least $62 billion and spin off PepsiCo’s beverage business - either globally or just in the Americas or North America. PepsiCo has said repeatedly that it sees no need for large deals or splitting off its global drinks business, which includes its name-sake soft drink, Tropicana juice and Gatorade. Fink said BlackRock currently owns 5 percent of PepsiCo. Peltz’s Trian Fund Management has a stake of about $1.3 billion, or less than 1 percent, in PepsiCo, which boasts a market capitalization of more than $131 billion. With such a small stake, Peltz would have to persuade large institutional shareholders to help him bring PepsiCo to the negotiating table, said Henry Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Quality Investing, which owns just under 1 million PepsiCo shares. “I don’t think I’d bet against him,” Smith said. Trian declined to comment. Peltz, who was involved in the breakups of Cadbury Schweppes and Kraft Foods, said his cause may be helped by the fact that 37 of the top 40 PepsiCo shareholders also own Mondelez. It may be easier to woo Mondelez shareholders, said Sandy Villere III, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co, which owns Mondelez shares. “You can have your cake and eat it too,” he said, referring to the growth prospects of Mondelez on its own and any future upside from a deal. PepsiCo may be forced to move toward one of Peltz’s options if he can generate institutional support, said Smith. “But that’s not going to happen in the next few months. That’s a multiple-quarter time frame,” Smith said. PepsiCo shares closed up 1.8 percent at $86.80 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. They have gained 21 percent during the past year, as the company has made progress streamlining its business and improving its performance.

433,BLK,Dell postpones meeting on buyout as more votes needed,"NEW YORK/ROUND ROCK, Texas (Reuters) - Dell Inc on Thursday postponed a shareholder vote on CEO Michael Dell’s $24.4 billion buyout offer, after he won 11th-hour backing from several large investors but still fell short of enough votes to seal the deal. The meeting was called and then adjourned minutes later, after shareholders gathered at Dell’s headquarters in Texas. Postponement of the vote until Wednesday buys time for Dell, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, to win over naysayers for a deal that could be the largest buyout since the financial crisis. Complicating matters, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has amassed an 8.7 percent stake in Dell, is leading a charge with major shareholder Southeastern Asset Management against the buyout with an offer of his own. He and others say Michael Dell’s deal undervalues the world’s No. 3 personal computer maker. Investors are divided over Dell’s prospects. Some are ready to cash out of a company increasingly vulnerable to a crumbling PC market. Dell has become a shadow of the company founded out of Michael Dell’s dorm room in 1984, which rapidly grew into a leader in the global market and a model of innovation. Others remain convinced the company can transform itself into a dominant provider of business computing services, under Dell’s leadership or otherwise. In the week leading up to Thursday’s meeting, Icahn’s team and Dell’s special board committee, which supports the CEO’s offer, flooded shareholders with letters and documents to argue their positions. Vanguard and BlackRock Inc are now on board with the proposal, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. Still, they said Michael Dell and private equity partner Silver Lake fell about 100 million shares short of the 735 million that they need for the buyout to pass. A large chunk of non-votes - which count as “nays” - from mainly retail investors, helped account for the shortfall, several investors told Reuters. Only 77 percent of eligible shares were voted as of Thursday, the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying. Dell declined to comment on that ratio, which suggests a high number of abstentions. Some arbitrage investment funds may also hold out hope that Michael Dell will bump up his offer price, they added on condition of anonymity. Arbitrageurs, who typically make short-term bets around the outcomes of deals and other major transactions, own roughly 350 million shares or 20 percent of the company’s outstanding stock, one of the investors estimated. Michael Dell may have to raise his $13.65-a-share offer to secure the deal, analysts and investors say. But other sources have said he and Silver Lake remain reluctant to pay more for a company that traded at about $10 before news of the buyout surfaced. “The delayed vote may speak to the Silver Lake/Dell transaction not finding necessary support,” said Topeka Capital Markets analyst Brian White. “A higher bid may be necessary to consummate this transaction.” Dell shares closed up 24 cents, or 1.9 percent, on Thursday, at $13.12 on the Nasdaq. It is unusual for corporations to adjourn shareholder meetings on such short notice, but governance experts say it can be done if the company bylaws allow it. Over the next week, the board will encourage the apparently large number of shareholders that had not cast votes to support the deal, said mergers expert Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College Law School. “To encourage these votes to come out, they will likely also try to re-engage Silver Lake to seek out a higher price,” he added. Icahn was quick call the adjournment “unfortunate” and reiterate that he found Dell’s offer too low. “This delay reflects the unhappiness of Dell stockholders with the Michael Dell-Silver Lake offer, which we believe substantially undervalues the company,” he said in a statement issued with Southeastern. “This is not the time for delay but the time to move Dell forward.” Vanguard and BlackRock had previously opposed the deal, but ultimately switched sides, a source said, requesting anonymity because the matter is not public. Other investors previously seen as swing votes, such as State Street Corp, Bank of New York Mellon Corp and Invesco also voted in favor of the deal on the eve of the shareholders’ meeting, the source said. T. Rowe Price Group Inc, Highfields Capital Management, Pzena Investment Management and Yacktman Asset Management have previously voiced opposition to the deal. T. Rowe Price, which owns roughly 4 percent of Dell’s stock, reiterated its opposition on Thursday to the deal. State Street declined to comment. Vanguard declined to comment. Representatives of the investment firms did not respond to requests for comment. Board member Alex Mandl, chairman of the special committee overseeing the buyout, set the new meeting date for Wednesday. Under so-called majority-of-the-minority voting provisions, a majority of shares, excluding Michael Dell’s roughly 16 percent stake, must be voted in favor for the buyout to go through. Shareholder Ed Benson from San Antonio, one of the many retail investors that account for an estimated 10 to 15 percent of shares in the company, turned up in Round Rock on Thursday but had expected the meeting to be adjourned. “It’s very hard to acquire that many votes,” said Benson, who supports the buyout proposal. But travel agent Linda Bush, who commuted to the meeting from the area, disagrees. “The majority of people I talked to didn’t vote for it,” she said. “We need to be paid more”.

437,BLK,BlackRock profit rises as investors look to multi-asset products,"* Base fees rise to record $2.2 billion * Negative outflows hit iShares business * BlackRock sees shift in fixed-income interest By Ashley Lau July 18 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, said on Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose 32 percent, citing strong global demand from its retail and institutional clients and growth in markets. Despite outflows from its iShares exchange-traded funds business, as investors pulled out money in the wake of expected changes to the Federal Reserve’s stimulus program, BlackRock generated $11.9 billion in long-dated net new business for the quarter. “We’re seeing more and more interest in multi-asset (products), where clients are looking for exposure but want to navigate around” an uncertain environment, Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in a conference call with analysts. More than 90 percent of the $11.9 billion net long-term inflows generated during the quarter came from multi-asset products, which had inflows of $11.1 billion. Net income at the New York-based company totaled $729 million, or $4.19 per share, up from $554 million, or $3.08 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time tax benefit from a charitable contribution, earnings were $4.15 a share, beating analysts’ average forecast of $3.82, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company ended the quarter with assets under management of $3.9 trillion, including new money and market gains, and generated record base fees of $2.2 billion. OUTFLOWS FROM iSHARES Total net long-term flows, however, were tempered by rare outflows - $963 million - from the company’s iShares exchange-traded funds, as investors exited the funds in the wake of signs in late May from the Federal Reserve that it would begin tapering its bond buying program. “The ability to exit quickly and the ability to exit efficiently and in bulk are part and parcel of our value proposition,” Fink said, defending the June outflows. Investors who used iShares funds to take on risk in the beginning of the year, redeemed nearly $15 billion in iShares in the three weeks following the Fed’s May 22 comments, Fink said on the call. About $7 billion of redemptions were from iShares fixed-income products, a BlackRock spokeswoman said, with the majority of the remaining outflows coming from emerging markets products. Much of weakness in outflows during the quarter came from the iShares flagship emerging markets equity, fixed income and commodities funds. Fink added that the most “handholding” came from iShares, “where we saw extreme volatility,” Fink said, noting that many investors were using the products for exposure to the market. “In the case of June, it was negative beta exposure, not positive beta exposure, and that’s okay,” Fink said. BlackRock, the largest U.S. provider of exchange-traded funds, bought iShares from Barclays in 2009. The unit now accounts for roughly 22 percent of its total assets under management. Fink, who said he sees the potential for the ETF market to grow to $5 trillion, said there still needs to be more education around how the investment vehicles, which represent a basket of securities that typically tack an index, behave in times of market volatility. “We need to make sure that the quality of products can withstand ... the tests of bouts of illiquidity, the tests of variances in the markets,” he said. ‘GREAT ROTATION’ IN FIXED-INCOME     Fink said BlackRock is seeing a rotation within investor interest in fixed-income, with flows moving into actively managed products. “We expect to see flows moving into more flexible, nontraditional fixed-income products,” Fink said, noting that flows into flexible bonds across the industry increased seven-fold, year-to-date, compared to the same period last year. At the same time, traditional bond flows have fallen nearly 80 percent, he said. BlackRock’s flagship funds, Multi-Asset Income and Strategic Income Opportunities, each gathered more than $1 billion in net new assets. While flows for the quarter overall beat analysts expectations, Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said flows have largely been uneven and inconsistent. “We would like to see more consistently positive flow trends,” said Shanahan, noting that part of the challenge is BlackRock’s sheer size, as it has become more of a proxy for the market. “When you manage almost $4 trillion, your results are going to more closely approximate trends in the market.” Shares of BlackRock were up 2.4 percent at $278.94 a share in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained about 34 percent so far this year.",7182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-earnings/blackrock-profit-rises-as-investors-look-to-multi-asset-products-idUSL1N0FO08820130718

439,BLK,Fidelity's early ETF strategy leans heavily on BlackRock,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments disclosed on Friday its plans to use U.S. money manager BlackRock Inc as subadviser on a slate of 10 new sector-oriented exchange-traded funds. The disclosure follows up a previously stated plan to have BlackRock help Fidelity develop its own line of equity sector ETFs. “The filing for 10 passive sector ETFs builds on our 30 years of experience in sector investing,” Fidelity spokesman Nicole Goodnow said. Early last month, Fidelity planned to make a major announcement about its ETF strategy, but canceled it after getting hung up with regulators, according to people familiar with the situation. Boston-based Fidelity is best known for actively managed mutual funds like Contrafund and Magellan, but the company has lagged rivals BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp by several years in rolling out an ETF platform. There are now more than 1,200 U.S. ETFs with assets totaling $1.4 trillion, up from assets of about $140 billion 10 years ago. As of June 30, BlackRock had $575 billion in ETF assets, followed by State Street ($318 billion) and Vanguard ($277 billion), according to State Street Global Advisors. Those three firms account for about 82 percent of the U.S.-listed ETF market. ETFs have become popular with investors because they trade like stocks and their fees are much lower than actively managed mutual funds. In recent financial statements, Fidelity has acknowledged how a shift to ETFs and index funds could have an adverse effect on the company’s investment management revenue. Fidelity registered 10 ETFs in which BlackRock would act as subadviser, according to a preliminary prospectus filed on Friday. No fees were disclosed for ETFs that would follow sectors such as consumer staples, energy, banks, healthcare, utilities and telecommunications. The ETFs have not yet been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In March, Fidelity said it expanded its three-year-old partnership with BlackRock to offer its customers free trading of more exchange-traded funds, as the once-dominant mutual fund company strives to catch up in a faster-growing market.

441,BLK,RPT-UPDATE 5-Michael Dell closes in on prize with sweeter $25 bln deal,"* Dell boosts bid, stock price rises * Icahn calls offer “an insult,” warns will fight on * Michael Dell bankrolling special dividend -source By Greg Roumeliotis and Eileen O’Grady NEW YORK/ROUND ROCK, Texas, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Dell Inc  and Chief Executive Michael Dell clinched a new $25 billion deal on Friday, boosting the bid and offering a special dividend in hopes of ending months of wrangling with opponents of the founder’s proposed buyout of the world’s No. 3 PC maker. The new agreement includes a special dividend of 13 cents per share on top of a 10-cent increase in the sale price to $13.75 per share. In return, Michael Dell and his private equity partner Silver Lake convinced the company’s special committee to agree to change the voting rules so that abstentions no longer count as opposing votes, a big boost for their camp. Dell shares rose after the announcement. But activist investor Carl Icahn, who has amassed an 8.7 percent stake in Dell and has opposed the buyout offer as too low, vowed to keep fighting. “We are pleased today to have won yet another battle, but the war regarding Dell is far from over,” Icahn said in a Friday statement. “We are not satisfied. We believe that an increase of a mere 13 cents is an insult to shareholders.” Icahn has sued the tech company in a Delaware court, trying to block the changes to the voting rules. Dell shares were up 5 percent at $13.61 in afternoon trading, a sign of increasing optimism that the deal will go through. But not everyone was convinced. “We do not believe this battle is over yet, especially given yesterday’s complaint filed by Carl Icahn,” said Topeka Capital’s Brian White. The battle over Dell has raged for months, adding more uncertainty about a company already shrinking along with a rapidly declining PC market. Dell is trying to transform itself into an IBM-like enterprise computing firm. Michael Dell and Silver Lake say a painful restructuring can best be performed as a private company, away from market scrutiny. Their new deal with the special committee, and a delay in the voting date to Sept. 12, boost the buyout consortium in several ways. The CEO is effectively agreeing to bankroll the special dividend, a source close to the matter told Reuters. Abstentions under the previous voting system counted as “no” votes. With an estimated quarter of eligible shares not having been voted either way, that proved a substantial hurdle to overcome. Under the new deal announced Friday, shares that are not voted will be excluded from the tally. A change in the record date by more than two months is also seen as enfranchising so-called arbitrage investors - hedge funds that bought Dell stock more recently to earn a few cents per share and would thus be more likely support the buyout. A vote on the buyout has been postponed now three times. The record date, which determines which shareholders are entitled to vote, will be reset to Aug. 13 from June 3. Under the deal, Dell shareholders will also be entitled to three regular quarterly dividends of 8 cents per share totaling 24 cents, since the first deal with Michael Dell and private equity partner Silver Lake was announced on Feb. 5. Michael Dell, who started the company in 1984 out of his college dorm room, agreed to swallow a hit to get the deal done, said the source close to the matter. The special dividend of 13 cents per share will be funded with excess equity resulting from his rolling over his shares in the deal at a lower price, subsidizing Silver Lake’s returns, according to the source. He had previously agreed to roll over his shares at $13.36 per share. Together with the 10 cent per share increase in the buyout offer, this results in an increase in the original $24.4 billion bid by about $350 million to nearly $24.8 billion. “If you have to go through these machinations to get these things through, it frankly is an excellent demonstration of why management buyouts are so problematic,” said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Although there is no regulatory or legal requirement for the buyout vote tally to include shares that are not voted, changing the rules of the game at this stage will give more ammunition to shareholders challenging the deal in court, legal experts said. Icahn and Southeastern Asset Management intend to contest the new deal, pressing on with their lawsuit. Last month, the two investors sweetened their share buyback proposal by adding warrants they say would increase the value of their offer to a range of $15.50 to $18 per share from $14 per share. Under their plan, Dell would remain a public company. Icahn has campaigned hard to get Dell to set a date for an annual shareholder meeting so he could put up his own slate of company directors and implement his proposal. But Dell refused to give him that chance. It said on Friday the annual meeting would be held on Oct. 17, long after the buyout vote is held. Another person familiar with the matter said shareholders could challenge the date of the annual meeting in court because it did not comply with rules that dictate it should be held within 13 months of Dell’s previous annual meeting, which was held in July 2012. But given that a new record date has been set for Aug. 13 the special committee would argue that a court cannot ask the company to hold the annual meeting much earlier than Oct. 17, the person added. Dell’s special committee chairman Alex Mandl on Friday explained the company’s decision to change the voting standard. “The original voting standard was set at a time when the decision before the shareholders was between a going-private transaction and a continuation of the status quo,” Mandl said in a statement. “Since then, the nature of the choice facing shareholders has changed because of the emergence of an alternative proposal by certain stockholders. In the context of the current decision, the committee does not believe it is appropriate to count shares that have not been voted as having been voted in support of any particular alternative.” Dell also agreed on Friday to reduce from $450 million to $180 million a break-up fee it would have to pay if the deal with Michael Dell and Silver Lake was terminated, and if within a year it enters into another transaction that does not lead to any party being a majority shareholder.",8022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/dell-buyout-vote/rpt-update-5-michael-dell-closes-in-on-prize-with-sweeter-25-bln-deal-idUSL1N0G30A220130802

459,BLK,RPT-BlackRock launches short-maturity bond ETF,"(Repeats to media clients) By Ashley Lau NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the largest provider of exchange-traded funds through its iShares business, is set to launch a new actively managed ETF focused on short-maturity bonds that will begin trading Thursday. The introduction of the iShares Short Maturity Bond ETF, which will trade under the ticker “NEAR” on the BATS Exchange, comes at a time when BlackRock and other ETF providers say concerns about rising interest rates have driven investor interest toward more short-term fixed-income securities. Rising rates cause bond prices to fall, and the longer the maturity of the bond, the sharper the fall. “I think we will continue to see investors repositioning toward short duration in anticipating of rising rates,” iShares’ head of fixed-income strategy, Matt Tucker, said in an interview. Financial markets expect the Federal Reserve will reduce its bond-buying program, which is designed to hold down long-term interest rates, in the months to come. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a bond to a change in interest rates. A bond with a shorter duration is typically less volatile when rates rise than long-term bond funds. Year to date, investors have put roughly $31.6 billion into short-term exchange-traded bond funds, according to BlackRock. The new iShares ETF includes a range of U.S. dollar-denominated short-term fixed-income securities with an average duration of one year or less. At least 80 percent of the fund will be comprised of investment-grade assets, which include U.S. debt and corporate debt. “We see this one-year duration being a nice in-between” to other existing funds, Tucker said. “It’s a part of the market where there are actually not a lot of offerings for investors,” he said. “It represents an interesting sweet spot for some investors who want to take on some risk but maybe not as much as even a two- or three-year duration fund might offer.” BlackRock currently has $55 billion in its active short-duration business, which includes a range of private and public funds. “This is a way for us to extend that lineup and basically offer an ETF that gives exposure to the short-duration part of the market,” Tucker said. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, bought iShares from Barclays in 2009. BlackRock had nearly $3.9 trillion in assets under management at the end of June.

At least 80 percent of the fund will be comprised of investment-grade assets, which include U.S. debt and corporate debt. “We see this one-year duration being a nice in-between” to other existing funds, Tucker said. “It’s a part of the market where there are actually not a lot of offerings for investors,” he said. “It represents an interesting sweet spot for some investors who want to take on some risk but maybe not as much as even a two- or three-year duration fund might offer.” BlackRock currently has $55 billion in its active short-duration business, which includes a range of private and public funds. “This is a way for us to extend that lineup and basically offer an ETF that gives exposure to the short-duration part of the market,” Tucker said. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, bought iShares from Barclays in 2009. BlackRock had nearly $3.9 trillion in assets under management at the end of June.",9262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-etf/blackrock-launches-short-maturity-bond-etf-idUSL2N0HK2AK20130926
461,BLK,"CORRECTED-Calpers concerned about Richmond, Calif.'s mortgage plan","(Corrects headline, and 1st and 2nd paragraphs to show that Calpers is concerned over the plan, not that it says it is opposed to it) By Jim Christie SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - As Richmond, California, moves forward with a plan to help struggling homeowners by using its power of eminent domain to seize underwater mortgages, the list of those concerned about it is growing - and now includes the pension fund for many of the very same city workers pushing the plan. The $268 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the nation’s largest public pension fund, joins banks and other investors in worrying that Richmond’s plan will undermine the value of its holdings. Calpers holds about $11 billion in income-producing mortgage-backed securities, though it calculates it has just $27,000 in exposure to mortgages targeted by Richmond. “We are sympathetic to homeowners but as fiduciaries our focus must be in the best interests of our members,” Calpers spokesman Joe DeAnda told Reuters in the fund’s first public statement on Richmond’s plan. “We are watching the issue closely and have some concerns about the precedent this may set and the impact to investors.” Meanwhile, the Service Employees International Union, which  represents 452 of Richmond’s roughly 900 employees, most of whom are members of Calpers, is a full-throated backer of the first-of-its-kind eminent domain plan. SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement that the plan is an overdue measure to prevent more foreclosures: “Tired of waiting on the banks and regulators, community groups and labor unions, including SEIU members, are taking action to find solutions locally.” The opposing stance of two organizations charged with protecting the financial interests of the same group of employees shows some of the complexities that have made it difficult to remedy ongoing problems created by the 2007 housing bust. The SEIU considers the fears of institutional investors over the possible impact to their holds such as Calpers to be unfounded scare tactics. It is more concerned with helping families struggling with their mortgage payments. Located east of San Francisco and home to an oil refinery, Richmond is a world away from the towns on the other side of the San Francisco Bay that are populated by the Silicon Valley elite. Under the plan, Richmond would buy up underwater mortgages for 80 percent of the homes’ current appraised value. The plan contemplates writing down the debt and letting homeowners refinance. Supporters say the plan would help avert foreclosures and make mortgages more affordable in a city plagued by a high percentage of underwater loans — a situation in which the balance owed on a mortgage exceeds the value of the property itself. Fully half of Richmond’s mortgage borrowers are underwater. “If the program succeeds it will help homeowners get principal reduction, which will help people stay in their homes and some day own their homes,” said Doris Ducre, a 60-year-old lab technician. She said her four-bedroom home in Richmond was last appraised at less than $200,000, well below the roughly $400,000 she owes on it. George Linn, spokesman for the Retired Public Employees’ Association of California, a group of retirees and active employees of Calpers, sympathizes with borrowers like Ducre, but he sees the plan as a risk for any investor in mortgage-backed securties. He intends to press that point at the next meeting of Calpers’ investment committee. “This may have far-reaching effects,” he said. “It’s not just in Richmond that people find themselves under water with their mortgages.” Richmond could use eminent domain, a power typically used to seize property for public purposes such as building roads, to acquire mortgages if the investors holding the mortgages turn down offers to buy homes at deep discount to the value of the loans. Richmond has already made offers for 624 delinquent and performing mortgages, spurring critics to say it is lending its eminent domain power to Mortgage Resolution Partners, the investor group that pitched the plan to Richmond and could split profits from refinancings with the city. The financial debate swirling around the plan doesn’t matter to Millie Cleveland, an SEIU field representative for Richmond who shares Mayor Gayle McLaughlin’s view of the plan. “Now we have the political will to take on the banks,” she said. Banks — Wells Fargo & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of New York Mellon — are contesting Richmond’s plan, but as trustees for others with stakes in mortgages in the city. And like Calpers, those bondholders — which include BlackRock Inc, DoubleLine Capital LP, Pacific Investment Management Co, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - are concerned Richmond may prove a precedent. “The fear is that it’ll open a floodgate,” said Vince Fiorillo, president of the board the Association of Mortgage Investors and global sales director at DoubleLine Capital. Richmond’s city council voted 4-3 to advance the plan earlier this month, but it would need a fifth vote to actually begin seizing mortgages, and it’s not clear when such a vote might take place. Wells and Deutsche Bank sued in federal court in San Francisco to halt the plan, but the suit was dismissed as premature. Bank of New York Mellon is pressing a separate suit against Richmond.

462,BLK,REUTERS SUMMIT-BlackRock sees strong ETF growth as Nordics catch up,"(For other news from Reuters Nordic Investment Summit, click here) * Predicts annual growth up to 30 pct in Europe, 40 pct in Nordics * Sees potential for $1 trillion European ETF market within five years By Mette Fraende COPENHAGEN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, predicts that Nordic countries will lead the way as investment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) achieves unstoppable growth over the next few years. ETFs are a relatively new instrument in the Nordics and will benefit from rising investor demand for multi-asset products, which will help to drive strong double-digit growth throughout Europe, BlackRock’s head of institutional business in Europe and head of Nordics said on Tuesday. “The general growth in Europe will be of 20 to 30 percent per year in the next three to five years, and that growth is unstoppable,” Peter Beske Nielsen said at the Reuters Nordic Investment Summit. “In the Nordics, I believe we will even see stronger growth as we are coming from a lower starting point and have some catch-up to do. Growth could be around 40 percent in the next few years.” The $220 billion European ETF market lags a long way behind the $1.5 trillion in the United States, though BlackRock believes that there is the potential to hit $1 trillion as the market matures over the next three to five years. BlackRock had nearly $3.9 trillion in assets under management at the end of June and is the largest U.S. provider of ETFs through its iShares subsidiary, which it bought from Barclays in 2009 and now manages $815 billion of assets. The iShares business controls about 39 percent of a global ETF market that BlackRock believes has the potential to grow to $5 trillion. BlackRock’s optimism for Europe is not limited to ETFs, however. About two months ago it said that companies that make their money in Europe should outperform globally-focused stocks in the coming months. It is particularly upbeat on prospects for the car, airline, retail and construction sectors. “I think European shares are approaching fair value, but they have emerged from a low starting point. I think there is still a little way to go,” Nielsen said. However, market volatility remains a concern for BlackRock’s clients, Nielsen added. With uncertainty still lurking in many parts of Europe and in the United States, he said that the Nordic countries are still viewed as a safe haven for corporate bond investors. “Investors start to focus on corporate bonds, and there are some healthy companies in the Nordics,” he said. Nielsen added that navigation of tightening global regulation in the wake of the financial crisis presents a major challenge for BlackRock, though he thinks that the proposed financial transaction tax will not be passed in its present form. “There may be a much milder version,” he said, adding that he expects to see a new proposal soon.

464,BLK,"Basel capital rules fall short, risky -Blackrock's Hildebrand","MEXICO CITY, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Policymakers have so far failed to create strong enough capital requirements for banks, which coupled with easy money policies, may sow the seeds of the next financial crisis, a BlackRock Inc. executive said on Tuesday. New Basel III rules, which require banks to rely more on equity than debt for funding, have missed the mark, Blackrock Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said at a central banking conference in Mexico City. “Sadly, I have become convinced in the last couple of years that we collectively fell short on Basel III,” said the    former Swiss National Bank Chairman. Those rules, combined with lose monetary policy that has distorted asset prices, put the banking system at risk for another crisis, as central banks have flooded markets with cash to lower interest rates and boost sagging growth. “It is not difficult to imagine a worst-case scenario where central banks are given responsibility for half-baked and incomplete macroprudential policies, which they will not be able to carry out effectively,” Hildebrand said. “As a result, they will at best partially achieve their objectives or at worst fail altogether, with the consequence of another boom-bust credit cycle occurring.” He sees “a risk that unconventional monetary policy cannot be removed in time,” allowing extensive distortions to build up in financial markets and spur another crisis. “Ultimately what I am concerned about is a race against time,” Hildebrand said. The Basel III accord is the world’s main regulatory response to the 2007-09 financial crisis that sent undercapitalized banks running to governments for help to stay afloat. The accord, which is to be phased in through 2019, will require banks to maintain top-quality capital equivalent to 7 percent of their risk-bearing assets, about three times what prior rules required them to hold, to withstand losses better.",10152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/banking-blackrock/basel-capital-rules-fall-short-risky-blackrocks-hildebrand-idUSL1N0I51X320131015
465,BLK,"BlackRock profit rises, boosted by asset growth","(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), which crossed the $4 trillion mark in total assets under management, was given a boost from investors pouring money into its iShares exchange-traded funds and retail business during the third quarter. Roughly 80 percent of the $25.3 billion investors added into long-term funds during the quarter went into the company’s iShares business, which had $20.3 billion of net inflows. “You’re seeing more and more ETF utilization across the globe as a tool for portfolio composition and as a tool for portfolio liquidity,” Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview on Wednesday. The 12 percent rise in total assets under management from last year helped boost BlackRock’s profit, which rose 15 percent from last year. Large asset managers make profits by charging fees as a percentage of assets under management. BlackRock’s diverse business lines across a mix of asset classes and clients has also allowed it to remain insulated to a certain extent against swings in investor sentiment. Even as investors pulled roughly $11 billion from BlackRock’s active and index equity products on the institutional side, total long-term flows were overall positive across asset classes during the quarter. “Our platform and the composition of our products has allowed us to take advantage of those changes in sentiment,” Fink said. FLOWS INTO iSHARES BlackRock’s iShares business, which it acquired from Barclays in 2009 and is the largest U.S. provider of exchange-traded funds, now accounts for roughly 23 percent of its total assets under management. The company has benefited from increased investor interest in lower-cost, indexed funds. In September alone, U.S.-listed ETFs added $33 billion in net new assets, the bulk of which went into U.S. and international equities ETFs, according to IndexUniverse. BlackRock has been expanding its iShares business within the United States and abroad. Earlier this year, the company completed its acquisition of Credit Suisse’s exchange-traded funds business and expanded its three-year relationship with Fidelity Investments, which now promotes 65 iShares ETFs to its clients without charging a commission. Previously, BlackRock paid Fidelity to list just 30 such funds. “IShares is an important business for BlackRock, but overall it’s part of a larger, passive franchise that is still very formidable,” Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said in an interview ahead of earnings on Friday. The New York-based asset manager on Wednesday reported net income of $730 million, or $4.21 per share, up from $642 million, or $3.65 per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items such as compensation expense, earnings were $3.88 a share, in line with the analysts’ average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Investors added more money than they withdrew across asset classes during the quarter, putting $11.3 billion into equities funds, $7.5 billion into fixed-income funds, $4.9 billion into multi-asset products and $1.7 billion into alternative products. BlackRock ended the quarter with total assets under management of $4.1 trillion, including new money and market gains.

468,BLK,Analysis: Debt fight dings U.S. Treasury bills' status,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The safe-haven reputation of U.S. Treasury bills took a beating during the latest debt ceiling fight in Washington, and it won’t be regained soon, even after the last-minute deal to avert a threatened default. The temporary agreement to lift the government’s debt limit may only pave the way for another political struggle between President Barack Obama and Republican lawmakers in early 2014 over the federal budget and borrowing levels. While others measure the toll on the economy from the 16-day federal government shutdown, Wall Street is fretting over the future appetite for U.S. debt and its effect on federal borrowing costs. During the next three-and-a-half months before the next debt ceiling deadline, the U.S. government might pay higher interest rates on its short-term debt. Before the shutdown, the Treasury was selling one-month debt at next to nothing. The rise in yields as a result of the crisis will cost the Treasury an estimated $56 million more in interest payments than it would have incurred had this month’s auctions been sold in September. While some one-month T-bill rates saw their yields decline to 0.02 to 0.03 percent after jumping above 0.70 percent less than 24 hours earlier, bills maturing in February still showed modestly elevated yields. If Washington repeats the battle that ended on Wednesday, bill rates would likely jump again. “There’s a fundamental change in their risk profile. There’s a growing lack of confidence. It’s going to be problematic,” said Tom Nelson, chief investment officer at Reich & Tang, a New York-based cash management firm that oversees more than $33 billion in assets. Investors are frustrated that they are forced to shun certain T-bill issues because of the self-imposed fiscal deadlines of politicians. Some of them want additional compensation to buy T-bills given the possibility of default every few months, even though most think the risk is very low. Chances of a default seemed almost unfathomable three weeks ago before the debt ceiling showdown that accompanied the first partial government shutdown in 17 years. “The reason you’re holding short Treasuries is because of their unparalleled safety and liquidity. If you’re not getting safety and liquidity, there’s no point in having them,” said Gregory Whiteley, who manages a $53 billion government bond portfolio at DoubleLine Capital in Los Angeles. Before the political impasse ended, interest rates on T-bill issues set to mature in the second half of October through the first half of November hit five-year highs. “This is the kind of volatility we have never seen. I’m afraid this will get worse and worse,” Reich’s Nelson said. The surge in T-bill rates stemmed partly from major money market fund operators, including Fidelity, JPMorgan, BlackRock and PIMCO, dumping their holdings of T-bill issues that mature in the next four weeks because they were seen most vulnerable if the government did not raise the debt ceiling in time. Reich’s Nelson took more drastic action. He said he cleared his funds of all T-bills that mature between now and the end of the year and did not jump back to buy them, even after President Obama signed the debt ceiling deal into law before midnight. In the meantime, default anxiety caused retail investors to rush to redeem their money fund shares. Money funds posted their biggest weekly outflows in nearly a year, as assets fell $44.77 billion to $2.606 trillion in the week ended October 15, according to iMoneynet’s Money Fund Report. The asset drop, while large, was still much less than the $103.21 billion plunge in the week ended August 2, 2011 during the first debt ceiling showdown between the White House and top Republican lawmakers. COST OF A SHORT-TERM DEAL A pick-up in interest costs, if it persists, would be a setback for the government as its deficit has been shrinking. “There are costs associated with going through this each time, costs embedded into Treasuries securities, costs the Treasury has to incur in higher risk premiums at auction,” said Rob Toomey, associate general counsel at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), on a call with reporters on Wednesday. Bidding at last week’s one-month T-bill sale was the weakest since March 2009. Demand at this week’s bill auctions improved on hopes of a debt agreement, but interest rates remained higher than where they were almost three weeks ago. Fitch Ratings on Tuesday warned it might strip the United States of its top AAA-rating due to the debt ceiling fight. “This highlights the risk in the United States. It’s not good for investors. If investors want to diversify from the U.S., this gives them a reason to,” said Brian Edmonds, head of rates trading at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. Skittishness in owning T-bills hurt Wall Street firms too. The 21 primary dealers, those top-tier investment banks that do business directly with the U.S. Federal Reserve, are required to buy the debt issued by the government at auctions. “There are too much uncertainties. That’s dangerous especially if you are a primary dealer when you have to underwrite Treasury debt,” said Edmonds.

469,BLK,JPMorgan close to $6 billion settlement with investors: source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is nearing an agreement worth close to $6 billion with a group of institutional investors to settle claims over shoddy mortgage-backed securities issued in the run-up to the financial crisis, a source familiar with the talks said. Representatives of JPMorgan and the investors met on Friday to discuss the settlement, though the two sides have not yet agreed to formal terms, the source said. The potential deal is separate from the preliminary $13 billion settlement JPMorgan has reached with the U.S. government that would resolve a raft of civil actions brought by several enforcement agencies.

A New York state judge is weighing whether to approve that deal after American International Group Inc and others objected, arguing that it was too small. In 2011, the law firm said its investor clients had instructed trustees overseeing $95 billion of securities issued by JPMorgan’s affiliates during the housing boom to investigate whether the bonds were backed by ineligible mortgages. The firm said its clients represented holders of more than 25 percent of the voting rights in the securities, which included bonds from Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, two firms that JPMorgan took over during the financial crisis.

The company had $23 billion in its legal reserves as of the end of the quarter. Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that JPMorgan’s tentative $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government could end up costing the bank closer to $9 billion after taxes, because the majority of the deal was expected to be tax deductible.

473,BLK,"UPDATE 2-U.S. copper fabricator ends fight against JPM, BlackRock funds","By Josephine Mason NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - U.S. copper fabricator Southwire Co dropped its legal fight against physical copper funds planned by Wall Street banks, as political and regulatory scrutiny make it unlikely the exchange-traded funds will ever be launched, according to a court filing on Monday. Southwire filed the lawsuit eight months ago after JPMorgan Chase & Co and BlackRock Inc got approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the first U.S. funds that would use copper as collateral against shares. The prospect of the copper ETFs had spooked industrial users who worried the funds would hoard a vast stockpile of metal off the market, starving them of raw material and driving up prices. At the same time, U.S politicians called for more regulation and scrutiny of the multibillion-dollar commodity trading businesses of Wall Street banks. JPMorgan and others are now trying to sell off those businesses. The dramatic change in circumstances surrounding the funds and their owners have make it less likely than ever that they would be launched, said Monday’s filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. “Rapidly changing market conditions now make it unlikely that the orders being challenged will lead to the listing and trading of shares,” said Robert Bernstein, an attorney at law firm Eaton & Van Winkle LLP which represents Southwire. JPMorgan and BlackRock declined to comment. The SEC did not respond to requests for comment. Southwire, one of the biggest copper users in the United States, said it still believes the funds would inflate prices and constrict supplies of the metal used for plumbing and electrical wire if they were launched. But mounting political and regulatory scrutiny of Wall Street banks’ involvement in the physical commodity trading, particularly the ownership of metals warehousing firms, has cut the chances that the funds would be ever launched. On the regulatory front, the Federal Reserve is reviewing its oversight of Wall Street’s commodity trading business and the London Metal Exchange is dealing with a crisis over its warehousing policy. “Today the situation is very different,” Bernstein told Reuters. Doubts emerged about whether JPMorgan would push ahead with its JPM XF Physical Copper Trust after the bank put its commodities business, including warehousing unit Henry Bath which would store the fund’s metal, up for sale this summer, Bernstein said. For BlackRock, its plans were complicated when Goldman Sachs Group Inc pulled its Metro warehousing unit as custodian for the product, he said. Neither firm has published a final prospectus for the funds with the SEC. JPM got the green light in December last year and BlackRock in February this year. The furor over the funds has also waned as market conditions have deteriorated. In late 2010, many analysts attributed copper’s  surge to over $10,000 per tonne from $6,000 to news of JPMorgan’s fund while China’s appetite for metal was red hot. That is dramatically different now. The copper market is in surplus; doubts remain about long-term demand growth from China, the world’s No. 1 metals user and commodities have fallen out of favor with investors. “I’m not seeing the basis for a compelling argument for launching an ETF right now. It might come back in the future. But right now it’s come and gone,” Bernstein told Reuters.",10282013,http://www.reuters.com/article/copper-etf-jpmorgan/update-2-u-s-copper-fabricator-ends-fight-against-jpm-blackrock-funds-idUSL1N0II1NC20131028
474,BLK,UPDATE 5-Batista's OGX ends bondholder talks as bankruptcy looms,"* OGX may seek bankruptcy protection Tuesday - sources * Oil producer faces end of grace period for bond payment * Creditors’ committee formed by Pimco, BlackRock, others * Price on 2022 bond slides to 9 cents, near all-time low   (Adds company’s naming new director of exploration, updates share price) By Jeb Blount and Guillermo Parra-Bernal RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - OGX Petróleo e Gas Participações SA, the cash-strapped Brazilian oil company controlled by former billionaire Eike Batista, said on Tuesday that debt restructuring talks with holders of $3.6 billion in bonds ended with no agreement. The announcement, made in a predawn securities filing, came just hours after Reuters reported that OGX was preparing to file for bankruptcy protection in a Rio de Janeiro court as early as Tuesday, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the situation. The company did not say why the talks collapsed. But sources close to the negotiations told Reuters in recent days that areas of disagreement between Batista, management and creditors ranged from the scope of a potential capital injection to the terms of a Batista departure from OGX, which has total debt of over $5 billion. OGX needs about $250 million of new funding to keep operating through April 2014, the company said in a presentation to bond holders during negotiations and in a posting on its website. Without new funding, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said it expects to run out of cash in the last week of December. OGX’s shares and bonds slumped in the wake of the announcement. Its stock closed down more than 20 percent in São Paulo on Tuesday, adding to a 90 percent-plus plunge this year. The price on its 8.375 percent bond due April 2022  slid to 9 cents on the dollar, down from about 10 cents on Monday and near an all-time low of 6 cents earlier this month. OGX bonds are down 89 percent this year, the worst-performing bonds among emerging market corporate debt, according to Thomson Reuters data. Once the flagship company of Batista’s sprawling industrial and commodities empire, OGX’s failure to meet expected oil output targets caused investors to doubt its ability to come up with enough revenue to service its debts and finance new exploration. That, in turn, sparked a domino effect that forced Batista to start dismantling his Grupo EBX conglomerate to raise cash to pay debt. The meltdown of EBX - which included a port operator and a shipbuilder as well as mining, energy and entertainment companies - is a dramatic change of fortune for the 56-year-old Batista, who just 18 months ago ranked as the world’s seventh-wealthiest person. His rapid decline has also become a symbol of Brazil’s own economic woes after the end of a decade-long boom that made it one of the world’s hottest emerging economies. OGX declined to comment further on the end of the debt talks or a potential bankruptcy protection filing. Late on Tuesday, the company announced that Gilberto Carvalho Lima, a 35-year veteran in the business and with the company since 2011, would take over as its new exploration director, maintaining appearances at least that operations would go on. Brazil’s eight-year-old bankruptcy law is similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States, and would give OGX a chance to reduce its liabilities and emerge as a going concern. Talks with a creditors’ committee formed by half a dozen  investment funds kicked off in August, as dwindling confidence in Batista’s ability to shore up OGX caused its bonds to slump.  Pacific Investment Management Co, the world’s largest bond fund manager known as Pimco, and BlackRock Inc are on the committee, whose members own more than half of OGX’s outstanding bonds. Officials at Pimco and BlackRock in Newport Beach, California, and New York, respectively, could not be immediately reached for a comment. If OGX does seek court protection from creditors, it would be the largest-ever corporate bankruptcy filing in Latin America, according to Thomson Reuters data. The decision whether to file comes as a 30-day grace period for OGX to pay $44.5 million in interest to investors is about to expire. OGX wants to exclude its OGX Maranhão natural gas unit from a bankruptcy protection filing, a source close to the situation told Reuters on Monday. Power producer Eneva SA  reached a deal on Monday with OGX Maranhão’s creditor banks to buy up to 66.7 percent of the unit should parent company OGX fail to honor its debts. Eneva was previously known as MPX Energia SA, which was part of the EBX conglomerate. Batista, who founded the company, remains part of Eneva’s controlling group alongside Germany’s E.ON. If an OGX bankruptcy request is approved by a court, the company will have 60 days to come up with a corporate restructuring plan. The company’s creditors, as well as the judge overseeing the case, will then have 30 days to endorse or reject the plan. OGX had buyout and financial advisory firm Angra Partners, Blackstone Group LP and Lazard Ltd as advisors in the negotiations with bondholders. The creditors’ committee hired investment-banking firm Rothschild and law firms Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and Pinheiro Neto Advogados to advise members on the talks. During talks, OGX and the bondholders discussed a potential $150 million credit line aimed at funding the company’s exploration campaign for a few more months. But there was disagreement over Batista’s plan to cut OGX’s debt by offering bondholders a stake in the company as well as the terms of his potential departure from the company, sources said.

475,BLK,"UPDATE 4-Batista's OGX sells stake in gas unit to Brazil fund, E.ON","By Jeb Blount and Guillermo Parra-Bernal RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Brazilian tycoon Eike Batista’s oil company OGX Petróleo e Gas Participações SA agreed on Thursday to sell its 67 percent stake in its natural gas unit for 344 million reais ($156 million), the day after it filed for bankruptcy protection. Under the deal, São Paulo-based buyout firm Cambuhy Investimentos Ltda will end up with 73 percent of OGX gas-unit OGX Maranhão Petróleo e Gas SA, statements from the companies involved said. Half that stake will come from buying 200 million reais of new stock in OGX Maranhão. The rest will come from a 200 million real payment to OGX for its remaining share of the gas producer. German utility E.ON SE will provide another 50 million reais of investment and hold 9 percent of OGX Maranhão when the deal is complete. The multi-step transaction also includes a 144 million real payment to OGX from OGX Maranhão to repay the cost of joint expenses. Without new money, OGX is expected to run out of cash by the end of 2013. The proceeds from the sale of OGX Maranhao come as OGX scrambles to raise at least $250 million that it said it needed to keep operations running through at least April. Investors, such as the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and the world’s biggest bond investor Pimco, have shown increased concern that OGX may use cash to fund inviable operations rather than repay $3.6 billion in debt. The parties agreed to the deal hours before OGX sought court protection from creditors, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The company left OGX Maranhão out of the bankruptcy protection filing because the gas unit was in talks for a potential capital injection or a buyout. Power company Eneva SA’s stake in OGX Maranhão will shrink to 18 percent from 33 percent as a result of the deal. E.ON is Eneva’s largest shareholder. “This new deal allows for smooth operations of OGX Maranhão amid OGX’s insolvency and implies no equity disbursements by Eneva, which had committed to inject 200 million reais in case of a Maranhão credit default,” wrote UBS Securities analyst Lilyanna Yang. A renowned entrepreneur who once said he would become the world’s richest man, 56-year-old Batista has seen his personal fortune tumble by more than $30 billion in the last 18 months as share prices of his listed companies sank. This has forced him to start breaking up his Grupo EBX conglomerate, which also included a port operator, mining and energy interests, and an entertainment company. OGX needs new capital to avoid losing its rights to its exploration areas and existing fields, its principal assets. While bankruptcy proceedings will not automatically result in their loss, Brazil’s oil regulator has warned OGX that it must meet all its contractual agreements with the government, including making investments, or risk losing its oil rights. The bankruptcy filing came after OGX spent about 10 billion reais exploring for offshore fields that failed to deliver on output expectations, the company said in court documents. It is scrambling, though, to hook up a second offshore field, Tubarão Martelo, by the end of November. OGX Maranhão, with its on-shore gas fields, is OGX’s best-performing asset and sells natural gas to Eneva’s power plants. OGX’s share of OGX Maranhão gas sales is about 2.1 million cubic meters a day. The offshore troubles led to a more than 98 percent drop in the value of OGX stock in the last 16 months. Worth about $45 billion in October 2010, the shares fell 24 percent on Thursday to close at 0.13 reais, giving the company a market valuation of about $190 million. Eneva, originally founded by Batista as MPX Energia SA, is led by E.ON, which bought 38 percent of the company from Batista earlier this year. Batista retains a 27 percent stake. Some analysts said OGX’s planned sale of OGX Maranhão and other assets such as the Tubarão Martelo field might reduce the amount of money that creditors could recover if the bankruptcy restructuring fails and OGX is liquidated. OGX has about $5.1 billion in debt, $3.6 billion of which is in the hands of bondholders such as Pacific Investment Management Co, BlackRock Inc and Loomis Sayles & Co. When OGX Maranhão is sold, OGX’s main assets will be Tubarão Martelo, which is expected to generate about $11 billion of revenue over its lifetime, and a 40 percent stake in the BS-4 offshore block, which has the potential to generate $6.2 billion, OGX’s bankruptcy filing said, citing reserve certification reports. Based on those values, Tubarão Martelo is worth $890 million and OGX’s share in BS-4 is worth $437 million, Deutsche Bank analyst Marcus Sequeira wrote in a report to investors Thursday. While he said creditors might get something from the bankruptcy, he said shareholders were likely to get nothing. In May, Malaysia’s state oil company Petroliam Nasional , also known as Petronas, agreed to buy 40 percent of Tubarão Martelo and an adjacent area for $850 million. In August, Petronas’ chief executive officer Shamsul Azhar Abbas said the company would not complete the deal without an agreement with bondholders. OGX on Thursday said the two companies may end up in arbitration if Petronas doesn’t honor its agreement. The only new money so far available to OGX comes from the OGX Maranhão sale: 200 million reais from Cambuhy and 144 million reais from OGX Maranhão in three payments through 2015 for OGX’s part of shared costs in the gas unit. The companies did not say whether proceeds from the deal would go to help repay OGX Maranhão’s 600 million reais of debt with lenders Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Morgan Stanley  and Banco Santander Brasil SA. Eneva wants to ensure a supply of gas as demand for power in Brazil is growing faster than the expansion of hydroelectric generation. New dams with smaller, less ecologically damaging reservoirs need to be supplemented with backup power from gas and coal during dry seasons. The investment in OGX Maranhão will help secure access to gas for Eneva’s power plants in Maranhão, E.ON said in a statement. Eneva will have the right to buy part or all of Cambuhy’s shares in OGX Maranhão during the next two years. Cambuhy was founded in 2011 by Brazilian banker Pedro Moreira Salles and three partners to oversee assets of clients and some of his family members. Moreira Salles is the chairman of Itaú Unibanco, Brazil’s largest bank by market value.

476,BLK,Invesco profit rises as assets grow on new client money,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asset manager Invesco Ltd (IVZ.N) said on Thursday that its third-quarter profit rose 34 percent as strong net inflows, primarily in its retail business, helped boost assets. The Atlanta-based money manager, which oversees the PowerShares line of exchange-traded funds, said net inflows of new client money totaled $9.1 billion, of which $7.3 billion came from the retail channel. “Clearly the retail engagement is there as markets go higher, whereas institutions tend to strategically reallocate when you get expectations in volatility around assets classes,” said analyst Mac Sykes at Gabelli & Co in New York. Assets under management at Invesco grew by $39.9 billion during the quarter to total $745.5 billion at the end of September, a 12.4 percent increase from a year earlier. The company benefited from market gains and foreign exchange rate movements. Invesco’s shares were up 2.0 percent at $33.56, after earlier rising as much as 4 percent. The shares have gained about 30 percent year to date. Rival asset managers saw a greater impact from institutional outflows during the third quarter as investors pulled billions of dollars, reflecting increasing caution among institutional clients. At T.Rowe Price Group Inc (TROW.O), Franklin Resources Inc (BEN.N), Janus Capital Group Inc JNS.N, and Federated Investors Inc (FI.N), clients withdrawals exceeded inflows during the quarter. Analysts focus on flow data because asset managers’ revenue and profits are closely tied to market indexes not under their control. Net long-term flows at Invesco, not including flows into institutional money market funds, were $5 billion. The total included $4.6 billion put into equity products, $1.4 billion into alternative funds, and $200 million into balanced accounts. Fixed-income was a weaker spot, with customer withdrawals of $1.1 billion. Money market customers pulled out $100 million in the third quarter. Invesco’s PowerShares QQQ fund (QQQ.O) added $800 million in net new money. PowerShares is the fourth largest U.S. provider of ETFs by assets, following BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Vanguard and State Street Corp (STT.N). Although the announcement earlier this month of the planned departure of one of Invesco’s top fund managers has drawn speculation that the firm could lose clients, Invesco executives in a conference call on Thursday said that so far there was no cause for alarm. Neil Woodford, one of the investment industry’s most closely watched fund managers, is to leave the firm’s Invesco Perpetual unit in April to start his own business after 25 years with the firm. Market participants and analysts have said that Woodford’s departure could pose a challenge to persuading investors to stick with Invesco, given his consistent performance and cult-like following. Woodford is to be replaced by Mark Barnett as head of British equities and take over management of his funds. Invesco Chief Executive Martin Flanagan said that in the days since Woodford’s departure was announced, redemptions from the two largest funds he manages, which total $38 billion, were less than $1.5 billion, or slightly more than 4 percent. “It’s early days, but the redemption experience has been very much toward the positive end of the scenarios we modeled and planned for, and considerably less than we’ve seen reported in the media,” Flanagan said. “We find the results encouraging.” Invesco’s third-quarter net income increased to $228.1 million, or 51 cents per share, from $170.6 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain costs from the expected sale of its Atlantic Trust unit, Invesco earned 55 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 52 cents, according to Thomson Reuters Invesco said the planned sales of its Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management unit, which manages roughly $20 billion in client assets, to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is expected to close in the fourth quarter.

The decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council to review the two firms does not mean it will necessarily designate them as systemically important, the newswire said. The review follows a study the U.S. Treasury Department released in September that said some activities of asset managers could pose risks to the broader marketplace.

Any firms given the systemic tag will face new capital requirements and oversight by the Federal Reserve in addition to any current regulations. The FSOC is a council of regulators chaired by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and comprised of the country’s top financial regulators.

482,BLK,"BlackRock adds Chinese industrials, energy stocks on reform push","HONG KONG (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N) has cut its bets on Internet and gaming shares in Asia and boosted exposure to Chinese industrials and energy stocks, expecting Beijing’s bold new reform agenda will lift return on equity. Andrew Swan, the head of Asian equities for the world’s biggest money manager, said he is also exploring opportunities among Chinese consumer companies catering to the mass market as they too stand to benefit from reforms and are attractively valued. The fund manager said he also remains overweight on India on hopes of a change in government next year. Reforms in China and India could pave the way for emerging equities in Asia to return to favor although risks remain. “It’s not without risk owning Chinese equities today,” Swan told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in Hong Kong. “What we are doing at the moment is adding a bit more of the risky stuff, but we are not taking a full plunge yet because there is this near-term volatility we need to get through and problems within the banking sector.” The BlackRock Asian Dragon Fund had nearly 28 percent of its assets invested in shares of Chinese companies at the end of October. Swan was confident his strategy would do well in the short term, which usually refers to a period of up to a year, as reforms to allow the market to play a greater role in pricing resources could lift profits at state-owned enterprises. “Some of these old China companies which have been cheap, underowned and out of favor actually can be a short-term beneficiary from reform,” the Australian said. China unveiled its boldest economic and social reforms in nearly three decades last week, relaxing its one-child policy and further freeing up markets in order to put the world’s second-biggest economy on a more stable footing. Swan, whose Asia ex-Japan fund returned 8.6 percent in January-October this year, outperforming its benchmark index’s 4 percent gain, said the stage is being set for an emerging market bounce-back. It may not be overly compelling today and there are risks to it but there is a real possibility that China and India will see reforms and global growth will pick up. That will create an “incredibly positive” outlook for earnings growth in Asia. “Ownership levels of Asian equities and valuations are low. That’s an incredibly powerful scenario,” he said. “We’ve still got to see progress on all those fronts before we get overly excited but that’s where my sense is that we are going,” Swan said. “I am giving it a higher probability post what’s happening in China.” Swan said Indian shares’ surprisingly strong rebound since the summer, ignores the near-term pressures and is built on expectations the country will see a change in government in 2014. Any disappointment will result in a big correction. The results of five state polls in India are due to be declared on December 8 in the run-up to next year’s national election. Opinion polls, though notoriously unreliable, have the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - led by  rising star Narendra Modi, widely seen as a business-friendly reformer - ahead of the ruling coalition led by the Congress party. “Elections do matter in India because policy matters,” Swan said. “If the BJP stumbles in these state elections or in the federal elections, then markets will go down a lot.” Swan, whose Asia ex-Japan fund has remained overweight in India through 2013, said his allocation tilted earlier in the year towards Indian companies with dollar exposure but he has now started to move into cheaply valued domestic companies in anticipation of a change in government. “The starting point today is reasonable valuations, reasonably cheap currency and reasonably depressed earnings. And if they get it right, all three of those things will turn around,” he said. “Dollar returns in India on a sort of three- to four-year view will probably be some of the best in Asia, if not globally, under that scenario.” Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits (For other news from Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, click here) ",11212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-investment-summit-blackrock/blackrock-adds-chinese-industrials-energy-stocks-on-reform-push-idUSBRE9AK0OT20131121
483,BLK,BlackRock doubles Telecom Italia stake ahead of key EGM,"MILAN (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s biggest money manager, has become the second-largest shareholder in Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI), giving it a potentially pivotal role in a shareholder vote on whether to oust the board of the Italian telecoms firm. At the end of November, it increased its combined holding in the Italian company to 10.1 percent from the 5.1 percent it owned in October, according to documents published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In October BlackRock had said a “very attractive valuation” was behind its decision to invest in the Italian phone company. The increase could potentially tip the balance at the shareholder meeting, scheduled for December 20, over the future of the phone company’s board, which is in question because of complaints of conflicts of interest and the possible sale of a Brazilian unit. However, it is not clear how many shares the U.S. investor will represent at the meeting since its stake in Telecom Italia is split among several funds. Miguel Carrasco, managing director at proxy solicitation company Proxy Census, said BlackRock would be unlikely to bring more than 60 percent of its stake to the shareholder meeting because of the different investment strategies of its funds. A source said Italy’s market watchdog Consob was not informed by BlackRock about its recent investment. Consob has asked the U.S. group to tell the market what its current stake in the telecoms firm is and whether it intends to be present at the shareholders meeting, the source said, adding the watchdog could rule for a sterilisation of voting rights on the stake not declared. BlackRock is required to answer before the stock trading resumes on Monday, the source said. A BlackRock spokesman based in London declined to comment on the developments. The board of Telecom Italia is currently controlled by Telco, an investment vehicle owned by Spain’s Telefonica (TEF.MC) together with Italian investors Generali (GASI.MI), Mediobanca (MDBI.MI) and Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI). Businessman Marco Fossati, an influential investor with a 5 percent stake in Telecom Italia, and small shareholders group ASATI are seeking the dismissal of the board, saying it favors the interests of core shareholders such as Telefonica. The Spanish group owns the majority of Telco, which controls Telecom Italia with a 22.4 percent stake, and has signed a deal to gradually take over the holding company. BlackRock’s move and the unexpected resignations of the representatives from Telefonica on the Telecom Italia board late on Friday are increasing the uncertainty over the outcome of the shareholder meeting. Telco is expected to hold a gathering on Thursday to prepare its strategy ahead of the event. The raising of BlackRock’s stake in the Italian phone company could be a game changer not only for the shareholder meeting, but also for Telecom Italia’s strategy regarding its Brazilian mobile unit TIM Participacoes (TIMP3.SA). Brazilian regulator Cade has said it should be sold to solve antitrust issues. Rebel investor Marco Fossati said last week he was opposed to selling the unit as it would damage Telecom Italia business, while the company’s Chief Executive Marco Patuano said last month TIM was a core asset and he would consider selling it only at a “convincing” price. A source who had spoken with investors at the financial firm said: “BlackRock favors the sale of TIM on the grounds that it would create value for shareholders.” ",12142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-telecomitalia-blackrock/blackrock-doubles-telecom-italia-stake-ahead-of-key-egm-idUSBRE9BD06220131214

486,BLK,Watchdog tells BlackRock to show its hand before Telecom Italia EGM,"MILAN (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) will have to say on Monday what stake it holds in Italy’s biggest telecom operator Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI), after the Italian market watchdog threatened to fine it for not disclosing an increase. At the end of November, the world’s largest money manager lifted its combined holding in the phone company to 10.1 percent from the 5.1 percent it held in October, according to filings it made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crossing the 10 percent threshold obliges the company to notify regulators, according to Italian market rules. If confirmed, the 10.1 stake would make BlackRock the second biggest shareholder in Telecom Italia by far after holding company Telco, and give it a potentially pivotal role in Friday’s shareholder vote on whether to oust the board of the Italian company. BlackRock informed the SEC at the beginning of December, but it did not tell Italian market watchdog Consob within a five-day deadline from the stake increase as required, the watchdog’s chief said on Sunday. “Our immediate reaction is the sanction procedure; we can impose a fine of a maximum 500,000 euros ($700,000),” Consob head Giuseppe Vegas told daily Il Sole 24 Ore on Sunday. The Italian regulator has told the U.S. group to make a statement on the size of its holding ahead of the Italian market opening on Monday and on what its intentions are at the shareholder meeting, Vegas told the newspaper. A source familiar with the matter said BlackRock was still in compliance with Italian law, as its stake only exceeded the 10 percent threshold if Telecom Italia convertible bonds the investor bought were included, and such bonds do not count as equity holdings outside the United States. The U.S. investor will clarify the details of its holding on Monday, the source added. BlackRock declined to comment on Sunday. According to Vegas, BlackRock had bought 3.56 percent in Telecom Italia between October 2 and December 13. It was not clear if this was on top of the 10.1 percent stake communicated to the SEC or of the 5.1 percent holding disclosed to Italian authorities in October. Consob is also trying to ascertain whether BlackRock acted on its own, or in agreement with other parties, including Telefonica (TEF.MC). The Spanish group owns the majority of Telco, a holding company which controls Telecom Italia with a 22.4 percent stake. Italian banks Mediobanca (MDBI.MI) and Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), and insurer Generali (GASI.MI) are also investors in Telco. BlackRock’s investment would allow it to overtake rebel Italian businessman Marco Fossati, who owns 5 percent. The size of BlackRock’s holding and any possible dealings with Telefonica are crucial because Italian legislation forces any investor or alliance buying a 30 percent stake in a company to launch a mandatory takeover offer on minority holdings.

491,BLK,BlackRock ups stake in Telecom Italia ahead of vote for control,"MILAN (Reuters) - BlackRock raised its stake in Telecom Italia to make it the struggling firm’s second-biggest investor ahead of a vote for control, but did not say if it would side with top shareholder Telefonica or rebels fighting the Spanish firm’s strategy. The world’s biggest money manager said on Monday it had a voting stake of 7.8 percent in Italy’s biggest telecoms group, which is trying to end years of sluggish growth and cut 28 billion euros ($38 billion) in debt. Telefonica believes the key to survival is selling Telecom Italia’s Brazilian business - valued at over $11 billion - to lighten debts that remain heavy despite the sale of assets in Argentina and the issue of convertible bonds. Such a sale would also benefit Telefonica by allowing it to retain sway over its own Brazilian mobile phone unit Vivo. It has been told by Brazil’s competition watchdog that without the sale it must seek a new partner for Vivo. But businessman Marco Fossati, an investor with a 5 percent stake in Telecom Italia, says selling TIM Participacoes, known as TIM Brasil, would damage Telecom Italia’s business. He and small shareholder group ASATI have forced a shareholder meeting on Friday to vote to dismiss the company board and appoint a new one. Fossati’s Findim Group submitted on Monday its slate of five candidates to take over as directors. One source with knowledge of discussions between the shareholders said BlackRock had seemed initially to be against plans to remove the board but in the last few days there had been talk they could support it. “On the surface the BlackRock move could be anything or nothing at all. They have so many funds,” the person said, referring to the complexity of the giant financial firm’s holdings. Italian market regulator Consob is trying to ascertain whether BlackRock acted on its own in upping its stake, or in agreement with other parties, including Telefonica, a source close to the matter said. Consob has also threatened to fine BlackRock for not disclosing the increase of its stake, which came to light in newspaper reports of an SEC filing at the weekend. BlackRock, which previously held around 5 percent of the phone group, said it had made no agreements over the Telecom Italia shares that required disclosure under Italian rules. It said it had registered shares for the meeting, but did not disclose its voting plans. The world’s biggest money manager said late on Monday it had amended a filing to U.S. watchdog SEC made on December 10 to show its holding in Telecom Italia as of November 29 had been 9.97 percent and not 10.14 percent. BlackRock said the incorrect filing had been an “inadvertent overstatement”, adding it would be informing the market about its latest holdings as of Monday within the next 48 hours, as requested by Consob. Adding to the uncertainty, the two Telefonica representatives on Telecom Italia’s board quit on Friday without providing an explanation. Sources close to the matter said the move was aimed at blunting criticism from Cade, the Brazilian competition watchdog, that Telefonica had too much influence over Telecom Italia. Fossati’s group says the board is still tilted in favor of large shareholders. Telecom Italia’s board is led by CEO Marco Patuano and controlled by Telco, the investment vehicle owned by Telefonica and its Italian partners Generali, Intesa Sanpaolo and Mediobanca, which owns 22.4 percent of the Italian phone firm. Telefonica recently tightened its grip on Telecom Italia by signing a deal to gradually take over Telco, which is expected to meet on Thursday to prepare its strategy ahead of the event. Industry sources said they expected shareholders with a combined stake of up to 54 percent to attend the shareholder meeting. A lower turnout would benefit Telco. Fossati’s campaign gained traction last week when proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis unexpectedly backed their proposal. But a third source, who had spoken with investors at BlackRock, said it favored the sale of TIM on the grounds that it would create value for shareholders. Shares in Telecom Italia ended up 5.1 percent after hitting a three-day high of 0.6985 euros in afternoon trading. “The block (of key shareholders) seems to be cracking and this gives the stock takeover appeal,” said Roberto Lottici, fund manager at Ifigest. “However it is hard to understand whether this is the right time to buy.

Shares in Telecom Italia ended up 5.1 percent after hitting a three-day high of 0.6985 euros in afternoon trading. “The block (of key shareholders) seems to be cracking and this gives the stock takeover appeal,” said Roberto Lottici, fund manager at Ifigest. “However it is hard to understand whether this is the right time to buy. I for one don’t hold any shares and am waiting, because visibility is very low.

The phone company said it had asked for clarifications, including by submitting a formal request on Dec. 14, but had received no answer so far.

495,BLK,RPT-Watchdog tells BlackRock to show its hand before Telecom Italia EGM,"* SEC says BlackRock raised Telecom Italia stake to 10.1 pct * Italy’s market watchdog threatens to fine U.S. investor * BlackRock will disclose stake on Monday, source says * Telecom Italia’s EGM to vote on ousting board on Dec. 20 By Francesca Landini MILAN, Dec 16 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc will have to say on Monday what stake it holds in Italy’s biggest telecom operator Telecom Italia, after the Italian market watchdog threatened to fine it for not disclosing an increase. At the end of November, the world’s largest money manager lifted its combined holding in the phone company to 10.1 percent from the 5.1 percent it held in October, according to filings it made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crossing the 10 percent threshold obliges the company to notify regulators, according to Italian market rules. If confirmed, the 10.1 stake would make BlackRock the second biggest shareholder in Telecom Italia by far after holding company Telco, and give it a potentially pivotal role in Friday’s shareholder vote on whether to oust the board of the Italian company. BlackRock informed the SEC at the beginning of December, but it did not tell Italian market watchdog Consob within a five-day deadline from the stake increase as required, the watchdog’s chief said on Sunday. “Our immediate reaction is the sanction procedure; we can impose a fine of a maximum 500,000 euros ($700,000),” Consob head Giuseppe Vegas told daily Il Sole 24 Ore on Sunday. The Italian regulator has told the U.S. group to make a statement on the size of its holding ahead of the Italian market opening on Monday and on what its intentions are at the shareholder meeting, Vegas told the newspaper. A source familiar with the matter said BlackRock was still in compliance with Italian law, as its stake only exceeded the 10 percent threshold if Telecom Italia convertible bonds the investor bought were included, and such bonds do not count as equity holdings outside the United States. The U.S. investor will clarify the details of its holding on Monday, the source added. BlackRock declined to comment on Sunday. According to Vegas, BlackRock had bought 3.56 percent in Telecom Italia between Oct. 2 and Dec. 13. It was not clear if this was on top of the 10.1 percent stake communicated to the SEC or of the 5.1 percent holding disclosed to Italian authorities in October. Consob is also trying to ascertain whether BlackRock acted on its own, or in agreement with other parties, including Telefonica. The Spanish group owns the majority of Telco, a holding company which controls Telecom Italia with a 22.4 percent stake. Italian banks Mediobanca and Intesa Sanpaolo, and insurer Generali are also investors in Telco. BlackRock’s investment would allow it to overtake rebel Italian businessman Marco Fossati, who owns 5 percent. The size of BlackRock’s holding and any possible dealings with Telefonica are crucial because Italian legislation forces any investor or alliance buying a 30 percent stake in a company to launch a mandatory takeover offer on minority holdings. The BlackRock stake increase could also potentially tip the balance at the shareholder meeting over the future of the phone company’s board, which is in question because of complaints of a conflict of interest and the possible sale of its prized Brazilian unit TIM Participações SA. Fossati and small shareholders group ASATI are seeking the dismissal of the board, saying it favours the interests of core shareholders such as Telefonica, which has a deal to gradually take over the holding company from its Italian investors. Telco is expected to hold talks on Thursday to prepare its strategy ahead of the shareholder vote. Consob has asked Telecom Italia to make a statement on when it was informed by BlackRock about its investment and said Telco should give explanations regarding its candidates should the current board be revoked.",12162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/telecomitalia-blackrock/rpt-watchdog-tells-blackrock-to-show-its-hand-before-telecom-italia-egm-idUSL6N0JU0LN20131216

502,BLK,U.S. probe examines Credit Suisse mortgage standards panel -source,"NEW YORK, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are examining a new set of Credit Suisse Group AG documents, including internal emails, that may show whether a bank committee charged with overseeing the quality of home loans ignored red flags to the detriment of mortgage investors, according to a source familiar with the documents. The internal bank group, called the Watch List Committee, was established in 2005 as Credit Suisse’s mortgage securitization business grew. Its job was to make sure that bad loans were not included in securities that the bank sold to investors. The emails, which have not been previously reported and were described to Reuters by the source, could play a key role in any action that prosecutors may decide to bring against Credit Suisse for its mortgage activities before the housing bust. U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Ellen Canale and Credit Suisse spokesman Drew Benson declined to comment on the investigation. The emails show Credit Suisse employees complained that poor quality loans were being allowed to go through because some members of the committee were focusing chiefly on the need to generate a large volume of loans, rather than trying to improve underwriting practices, according to the source. One of the emails that prosecutors are examining is from John Vibert, who served as co-head of non-agency mortgage trading at Credit Suisse in the years leading up to the crisis and was a member of the Watch List committee, the source said. In the internal email, Vibert complained that the committee was “driven by the sales psychology of Mike Fallacara and Chris Delfs,” according to the source. Delfs was the head of RMBS sales at the time, while Fallacara headed the bank’s loan conduit, charged with securitization and reselling the loans. Committee members also complained in emails that Delfs and Fallacara were dominating the committee’s activities, the source said. Delfs and Vibert declined to comment. Reached by phone in late December, Fallacara referred Reuters to his lawyer, who declined to comment on Friday. Prosecutors have not accused any banker of wrongdoing, and it is unclear if there will be any action brought against individual bankers who served on the committee. Fallacara is now a managing director at Fortress Investment Group. Delfs joined Toronto-Dominion Bank in November as a vice president for mortgage capital markets. Vibert is a managing director and a member of the Securitized Assets Investment Team at BlackRock Inc. Credit Suisse is being investigated by the Justice Department’s Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, a network of law enforcement agents and prosecutors - both state and federal - jointly investigating the mortgage market meltdown.",1072014,http://www.reuters.com/article/creditsuisse-mortgageprobe/u-s-probe-examines-credit-suisse-mortgage-standards-panel-source-idUSL2N0KD0RQ20140107
503,BLK,BlackRock agrees to end analyst surveys and assist  probe,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, agreed to end its analyst survey program worldwide, as part of an agreement reached Wednesday with the New York Attorney General’s office. The agreement stems from an investigation by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman into the early release of Wall Street analyst sentiment to “front-run” the market. BlackRock agreed to pay $400,000 for the cost of the investigation, but no fine or penalty, and to cooperate in Schneiderman’s ongoing industry-wide probe. At a press conference on Thursday, Schneiderman said the continuing investigation includes looking at the analysts and brokerage firms that participated in the surveys. He said BlackRock’s agreement was a “major step forward” in ensuring a level playing field for all investors. “We’re going to continue to crackdown,” Schneiderman said. “This is a growing area of concern because ... sophisticated market participants can gain early access to market-moving information that provides them an unfair advantage over the rest of us.” The Analyst Survey Program operated by BlackRock was believed to be the largest analyst survey in the world, Schneiderman said. The program asked many of the most prominent analysts at dozens of brokerage firms a series of questions related to the companies they were covering, according to the agreement. Although the survey was supposedly to quantify the analysts’ publicly available insights, Schneiderman found evidence that the program’s design allowed it to capture “non-public analyst sentiment that could be used to trade ahead of the market reaction to upcoming analyst reports,” the agreements said. Participating analysts were rewarded with higher ratings in financial industry magazine rankings, Schneiderman found, which helped analysts’ name recognition and careers and may have led to monetary gain for the analysts and their firms. “When analysts would provide answers to questions regarding their views on possible future earnings scenarios, possible M&A; activity and other matters, BlackRock was ... trying to learn the sentiment to be expressed in upcoming reports,” Schneiderman said. Analysts and their firms are prohibited from providing select clients with early disclosure of research reports, which can move markets, he said. The analysts were surveyed on a quarterly or monthly basis, depending on where they were located geographically, and included hundreds of thousands of responses. The U.S. surveys would ask analysts to answer questions on a scale of 1 through 9, and the responses were averaged, aggregated and converted into quantitative return forecasts. The program was developed in 2003 by Barclays Global Investors, which BlackRock acquired in 2009. When it was started, Scientific Active Equities, the quantitative investment group within BGI and now BlackRock, believed it could use the responses to “forecast” analysts’ “next estimate revision,” the agreement said. An internal SAE document also revealed the program’s success depended in part on a “willingness to really give us advance information.” “We’re trying to front-run” recommendations, another internal document said. The timing of the questionnaires also made them susceptible to obtaining advance information, the agreement said, including “targeted survey waves” just before covered companies’ “heavy earnings” seasons. Brian Beades, a BlackRock spokesman, told Reuters that the language in the internal memos is “totally inconsistent with the standards by which BlackRock does business.” He said the firm discontinued use of the survey “to avoid even the appearance of any impropriety.” BlackRock neither admitted nor denied the attorney general’s findings in the agreement. The attorney general’s office said the conduct violated the Martin Act, the state’s securities fraud statute, and other state laws. In July, Thomson Reuters Corp said it would suspend its early release of the widely watched Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment data to a small group of clients in response to a probe by Schneiderman. The news and information company had an arrangement with the University of Michigan to allow some of its clients to receive the data 2 seconds before its other clients who get the survey five minutes ahead of a wider public release.

507,BLK,Italian regulator brings civil suit against BlackRock fund manager,"LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Friday that Italy’s market regulator has started civil proceedings against one of its fund managers alleging that he used inside information to sell shares in Saipem just before the oil services firm issued a profit warning in 2013. Consob, the Italian securities regulator, claimed that Nigel Bolton, a portfolio manager and head of BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Ltd’s European Equity Team, used non-public information when he sold more than 2 percent, or about 10.7 million, of Saipem’s stock last January. “While BlackRock is not charged in the proceeding, it may be liable for the actions of its employee,” the world’s biggest money manager said in a regulatory filing late Friday, adding that it does not believe that Bolton will be found liable. The sales that BlackRock said took place between January 25 and 29, preceded Saipem’s announcement on the 29th that it was cutting its 2012 outlook. That move sparked a more than 30 percent slump in the Italian company’s shares. The regulator claimed the sale avoided over 114.5 million euros ($156.54 million) in BlackRock client losses. Following an internal investigation, BlackRock said it believes the sale was made based on widely disseminated, public information, including a third-party analyst research report reducing Saipem’s earnings estimates. “Insider trading is abhorrent to BlackRock’s values, and we would never tolerate it,” the investment firm said in an emailed statement in response to an earlier Reuters report that the regulator had launched a probe. BlackRock in its filing said Consob also alleged that the firm declined to provide it with information and was an obstacle to the regulator’s investigation. The fund manager said it believes it has fully cooperated with Consob, and that it will continue to do so. Consob opened an initial probe into the profit warning and subsequent share sales last February. Consob declined to comment on Friday. Saipem, which is 43 percent owned by Italian oil major Eni, also declined to comment. Saipem, which cut its outlook for a second time in June, is embroiled in a corruption probe over allegations it paid bribes to win contracts in Algeria. Saipem has denied any wrongdoing. News of that probe, which emerged in December 2012, led to the ousting of Saipem’s long-standing chief executive Pietro Franco Tali and his replacement by Umberto Vergine. The corruption allegations, along with concerns that a new management team could uncover more bad news, prompted several funds to sell their shares in the oil services company at the end of 2012.

509,BLK,REFILE-Italian regulator probes BlackRock over 2013 Saipem share sale,"(Refiles to add Reuters Instrument Code for Saipem) By Stephen Jewkes and Chris Vellacott LONDON/MILAN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Italy’s market regulator is investigating whether fund manager BlackRock used inside information when it sold shares in Saipem just before the oil services firm issued a profit warning in 2013, two sources familiar with the matter said. Consob has written to the world’s biggest money manager asking whether it had information that was not available to all market participants when it sold more than 2 percent of Saipem’s stock last January, a day before the firm cut its  2012 outlook, the sources said. The warning sparked a slump of more than 30 percent in Saipem shares. BlackRock said on Friday the decision to sell the shares was based on “a growing wave of negative publicly available information that was widely disseminated in the marketplace,” and that it was cooperating with Consob. “Insider trading is abhorrent to BlackRock’s values, and we would never tolerate it,” the investment firm said in an emailed statement in response to a request for comment on the probe.

510,BLK,Italian regulator brings civil suit against BlackRock fund manager,"LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Friday that Italy’s market regulator has started civil proceedings against one of its fund managers alleging that he used inside information to sell shares in Saipem just before the oil services firm issued a profit warning in 2013. Consob, the Italian securities regulator, claimed that Nigel Bolton, a portfolio manager and head of BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Ltd’s European Equity Team, used non-public information when he sold more than 2 percent, or about 10.7 million, of Saipem’s stock last January. “While BlackRock is not charged in the proceeding, it may be liable for the actions of its employee,” the world’s biggest money manager said in a regulatory filing late Friday, adding that it does not believe that Bolton will be found liable. The sales that BlackRock said took place between January 25 and 29, preceded Saipem’s announcement on the 29th that it was cutting its 2012 outlook. That move sparked a more than 30 percent slump in the Italian company’s shares. The regulator claimed the sale avoided over 114.5 million euros ($156.54 million) in BlackRock client losses. Following an internal investigation, BlackRock said it believes the sale was made based on widely disseminated, public information, including a third-party analyst research report reducing Saipem’s earnings estimates. “Insider trading is abhorrent to BlackRock’s values, and we would never tolerate it,” the investment firm said in an emailed statement in response to an earlier Reuters report that the regulator had launched a probe. BlackRock in its filing said Consob also alleged that the firm declined to provide it with information and was an obstacle to the regulator’s investigation. The fund manager said it believes it has fully cooperated with Consob, and that it will continue to do so. Consob opened an initial probe into the profit warning and subsequent share sales last February. Consob declined to comment on Friday. Saipem, which is 43 percent owned by Italian oil major Eni, also declined to comment.

513,BLK,UPDATE 4-BlackRock profit jumps on strong markets; shares gain,"By Ashley Lau Jan 16 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, benefiting from strong markets and a flow of new money into its exchange-traded funds and retail business. The New York-based asset manager ended the fourth quarter through Dec. 31 with $4.3 trillion in assets, including new money and market gains, surpassing the $4 trillion mark for the first time last year. That asset growth - a 14 percent rise from the end of 2012 - helped drive BlackRock’s 24-percent jump in quarterly profit to $841 million, or $4.86 per share, up from $690 million, or $3.93 per share, a year earlier. BlackRock and its peers make money by charging fees as a percentage of assets under management. “They are well positioned to generate solid growth almost regardless of the market environment, given that they have a very broad product offering,” said Jason Weyeneth, a New York-based analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc, focusing on the asset management sector. BlackRock shares were up 1.7 percent at $317.96 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier jumping as much as 4.2 percent. The stock surged 53 percent in 2013, riding an equity market rally that also boosted its peers. The company said its board had approved a 15 percent increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $1.93 per common share, payable in March. Excluding long-term compensation expenses and other items, earnings were $4.92 a share, above analysts’ average forecast of $4.33, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts said part of that profit gain may have been driven by a lower tax rate and better than expected performance fees. Revenue grew 9 percent to $2.8 billion. Revenue generated by fees based on a portfolio’s performance rose 2 percent to $268 million from a year earlier. iSHARES, RETAIL BlackRock has benefited from increased investor appetite for the less-expensive indexed funds provided by iShares, which the company acquired from Barclays in 2009 and is now the largest U.S. provider of ETFs. iShares makes up 21 percent of the company’s assets under management. Of the $40.5 billion that investors poured into long-term funds during the quarter, nearly half - $19.1 billion - went into the company’s iShares exchange-traded funds business. Retail investors accounted for $16.6 billion, or 41 percent of total long-term net flows. “You typically observe retail coming in when markets have recovered and look more stable, and they tend to sell when things get choppy,” said St. Louis-based Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan. “Institutions are taking profits at these levels and retail is piling in,” Shanahan said, noting that the increased activity on the retail side was consistent with the broader industry. BlackRock has been expanding its iShares business within the U.S. and abroad. “We think Europe is going to be a place of accelerated growth” for ETFs, Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview on Thursday. BlackRock last year acquired Credit Suisse’s ETF business and hired Rachel Lord, previously with Citigroup, to head its iShares business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Fink said he saw the potential for ETF assets to eventually account for 25 percent of the mutual fund industry. ETFs currently represent about 15 percent of the industry. The bulk of investor money during the quarter went into equities, which accounted for $24.7 billion, or roughly 61 percent, of BlackRock’s long-term net inflows. Investors also added more money than they withdrew in fixed-income funds, which had net inflows of $1.5 billion, and multi-asset products, which had $17.4 billion. BlackRock is increasingly turning its focus to the retirement market, where it sees a ripe opportunity. “We believe the defined contribution area is the greatest growth area,” Fink said. “We have to start focusing on things like longevity” and education around saving for retirement. BlackRock said it had $30 billion in net inflows into its defined contribution channel for the year, increasing its total assets in the unit to $525 billion. That’s up 30 percent from last year when assets in defined contribution plans totaled roughly $405 billion. BlackRock now has the fourth-largest franchise in the defined contribution industry in terms of assets in their plans, Fink said. BlackRock’s LifePath target-date funds, which serve more than eight million individual investors, now have more than $100 billion in assets. Fink said on a call with analysts that BlackRock was forming a new U.S. retirement group that will focus on product development and services geared toward individual investors. The expansion follows BlackRock’s introduction of a new series of indexes and funds called the “CoRI” Retirement Index series, which BlackRock launched last year and allows pre-retirees to estimate how much their current savings would produce in terms of annual income when they turn 65. The new retirement group will be led by Chip Castille, who heads BlackRock’s U.S. and Canada defined contribution group.",1162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-results/update-4-blackrock-profit-jumps-on-strong-markets-shares-gain-idUSL2N0KQ0FV20140116

Other investors in the hunt include rival private equity firms Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Bain Capital, the people familiar with the matter said. Sovereign wealth funds from Asia and the Middle East are also in a group of 20 or so investors preparing to submit first-round offers by mid-February, they said. Reuters previously reported that Huarong was planning to sell a stake of between 15-20 percent to strategic investors ahead of an eventual initial public offering.  Overseeing total assets of 400.9 billion yuan ($66 billion), Huarong is the largest of China’s four bad loan managers. Huarong’s planned stock offering will allow the company to raise money to expand its business - acquiring bad loans and forfeited assets from companies unable to repay their lenders. Huarong turns a profit by repackaging the loans and assets and selling them on. As China’s economy slows, a wave of loans is expected to turn sour. That will boost prospects for Huarong and the three other asset managers set up by the Chinese government in 1999 to remove an estimated 1.4 trillion yuan ($230 billion) worth of bad loans from the country’s top four state lenders. “NPLs (non-performing loans) will keep rising in absolute terms and relative to the loan base (in ratio terms) from less than 1 percent, which is low and unsustainable,” said Grace Wu, a Daiwa Capital markets analyst. “China has a large enough buffer to absorb a three-four times increase in NPLs. Some will argue that a lot of loans are rolled over in what is called ‘evergreen loans’ but that’s the nature of lending in China,” she added. Huarong’s fund-raising plans come on the heels of China Cinda Asset Management Co Ltd’s (1359.HK) $2.9 billion Hong Kong IPO in December. Cinda’s stock has risen 43 percent above the offer price. In an emailed statement late on Thursday, Huarong reported a slower, but still strong increase in net profit in 2013. It said it would be focusing its efforts this year on its planned share listing. The company, which has said it wants to list by 2016 at the latest, said its net profit rose 45 percent to 10.07 billion yuan ($1.67 billion) in 2013. A year earlier, it grew 65 percent. Huarong was set up in 1999 to manage the non-performing loans of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (601398.SS), the world’s biggest bank by market value. Controlled by China’s finance ministry, Huarong was restructured into a joint stock financial holding group in 2012 in preparation for its own listing. China Life Insurance Co Ltd (2628.HK)(601628.SS), the world’s biggest insurer by market value, owns 1.6 percent of Huarong. Cinda’s IPO attracted some of the biggest names in global investing as cornerstone investors to provide a solid structure for its IPO.

520,BLK,BlackRock calls for better Spanish governance rules,"LONDON/MADRID (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N), the world’s biggest fund manager, has urged Spain to improve governance at its top companies to protect investors flooding back into a country showing signs of emerging from a long and deep recession. BlackRock’s directors of corporate governance on January 9 wrote to the head of Spain’s CNMV regulator, who is reviewing Spain’s often opaque corporate governance rules, to lend support to initial reform plans and suggest some more of their own. “As a major investor in Spain, BlackRock is keenly interested to ensure a robust corporate governance regime is in place, one that protects the interests of our clients as long-term shareholders and that ensures there is sufficient information in the public domain to enable investors to hold boards and management to account,” they said in the letter. Building on suggestions from a panel of experts appointed by the government to review corporate governance, BlackRock, which invests more than $3 trillion on behalf of clients, called for three further changes to help protect investors. As well as calling for an opportunity to re-elect directors on an annual basis and improved engagement from companies on corporate governance, it also wants at least half of the board at companies in the blue-chip IBEX .IBEX to be independent, rather than the third currently recommended by the regulator. “Board independence is a problem in Spain,” said Rob Hardy, European Head of Corporate Governance at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which manages about $135 billion in European equities. “Independent boards are unusual. Enagas has got one, BBVA is pretty close, but there are not very many.” While acknowledging recent steps to improve governance in Spain, BlackRock said increasing the number of independent directors would help rebalance the power within boards, “especially in cases where there is a combined chairman/CEO”. Power has traditionally concentrated in the hands of chairmen since Spain, a dictatorship until the 1970s, was slow to embrace stock markets. Oil group Repsol (REP.MC), chaired by Antonio Brufau, has no chief executive, nor does utility Iberdrola (IBE.MC), chaired by Ignacio Galan. At Inditex (ITX.MC), the world’s largest clothing retailer, Pablo Isla is both chairman and chief executive after the founder and largest shareholder of the firm, Amancio Ortega, proposed him on stepping down in 2011. The issue of poor governance is particularly keenly felt by so-called passive funds that track an index and must invest in a company and look to improve it from within, as opposed to active mangers which can choose to not buy a company they dislike. After a bumper 2013 in which it gained 21.5 percent, the IBEX is flat in early 2014, though still outperforming rivals including France's CAC-40 .FCHI, down nearly 3 percent. That has been helped by record inflows to Spanish stocks in the week to January 22, data from fund tracker EPFR showed. JPM-AM’s Hardy said Spain had made strides in recent years in areas such as the number of women on boards, and was not the worst place to invest. “I’ve more issues in France, from a governance standpoint, than I have in Spain,” he said.

523,BLK,"UPDATE 3-Invesco profit jumps 81 pct on unit sale, strong markets","By Ashley Lau Jan 30 (Reuters) - Invesco Ltd said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit jumped 81 percent, boosted by strong markets and the sale of its Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management unit. The Atlanta-based money manager, which oversees the PowerShares line of exchange-traded funds, said net profit rose to $287.4 million, or 64 cents per share, from $158.7 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding the sale of its Atlantic Trust unit, which Invesco sold to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce for $210 million, the company earned 58 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Strong markets and demand for alternative and equity products helped drive growth in assets under management at the firm during the quarter. “In risk-on environments, clients shift demand toward equities,” Chief Executive Officer Martin Flanagan said on a call with analysts on Thursday. “This is exactly what we experienced.” Invesco shares were up 1.8 percent at $33.64 in midday  trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Invesco shares gained 39.5 percent in 2013, mirroring the rise in the broader stock market. Invesco ended the year with $778.7 billion in total assets under management, an increase of $33.2 billion during the three months ended Dec 31, and up 16.7 percent from a year ago. A market rally in 2013 in which the S&P; 500 gained 29.6 percent over the year drove those gains at Invesco and boosted funds flowing into the asset management industry. Among other major asset managers, both BlackRock Inc  and T.Rowe Price Group Inc reported a 24 percent increase in profit during the fourth quarter. Net long-term flows at Invesco, not including flows into institutional money market funds, were $1 billion. They were largely lifted by investors pouring money into equity and alternative products, which had net inflows of $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion during the quarter, respectively. “When you look at the big, core publicly traded asset management firms, they’re doing the best on flows” over the past two years, said Luke Montgomery, a New York-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “This quarter may not be as relatively robust, but it’s still pretty good.” Flanagan said Invesco launched more funds during the fourth quarter than it did in any full calendar year over the past five years. “These product launches are designed to further solidify our position as one of the largest managers of alternatives for U.S. institutional investors,” he said. Invesco’s PowerShares QQQ fund added $2.6 billion in net new money. PowerShares is the fourth-largest U.S. provider of ETFs by assets, following BlackRock Inc, Vanguard and State Street Corp. Analysts focus on flow data because asset managers’ revenue and profits are closely tied to market indexes not under their control. One of Invesco’s top fund managers, Neil Woodford, is set to depart in April after 25 years with the firm, which analysts and market participants have said could lead to the defection of clients loyal to Woodford. “I think it’s inevitable that there will be outflows,” Montgomery said, noting that the bulk of the potential client departures would likely come around the time of Woodford’s departure. “You’re going to see the most amount of noise around that time.” Still, “there’s enough strength in the rest of (Invesco’s) platform to offset what’s going on with (Woodford’s) departure,” Montgomery said. Woodford, one of the investment industry’s most closely watched fund managers, has developed a strong client base over the years, given his consistent performance and cult-like following. Flanagan sought to allay concerns about client defections during the investor and analyst call. “We continue to see strong evidence that many clients are choosing to remain invested in the funds,” Flanagan said, referring to Tuesday’s announcement that Edinburgh Investment Trust will retain Invesco as manager of the trust. Invesco first announced Woodford’s departure in October. He is being replaced by Mark Barnett, who will take over management of Woodford’s funds as head of British equities. “The market has been extremely receptive toward Mark,” Flanagan said.",1302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/invesco-results/update-3-invesco-profit-jumps-81-pct-on-unit-sale-strong-markets-idUSL2N0L40PB20140130

Analysts on average had expected 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Invesco ended the year with $778.7 billion in total assets under management, an increase of $33.2 billion during the quarter, and up 16.7 percent from a year ago. Net long-term flows at Invesco, not including flows into institutional money market funds, were $1 billion. They were largely lifted by investors pouring money into equity and alternative products, which had net inflows of $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion during the quarter, respectively. Analysts focus on flow data because asset managers’ revenue and profits are closely tied to market indexes not under their control. Invesco’s PowerShares QQQ fund (QQQ.O) added $2.6 billion in net new money. PowerShares is the fourth-largest U.S. provider of ETFs by assets, following BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Vanguard and State Street Corp (STT.N).

525,BLK,BlackRock launches new currency-hedged ETFs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s iShares, the largest U.S. provider of exchange-traded funds, is launching a new set of currency-hedged ETFs on Tuesday as it looks to target investors interested in international equity exposure but concerned about potential losses from a rising U.S. dollar. The new iShares ETFs, which are set to begin trading Tuesday on the NYSE Arca, will focus on Japan, Germany, and EAFE countries, which include developed markets outside of the U.S. and Canada. The ETFs hedge by using foreign currency forward contracts, which allow market participants to lock in an exchange rate on a specific date. “There’s much more attention paid to the fluctuations of currency, particularly in a year where we believe U.S. interest rates are rising, likely strengthening the U.S. dollar,” said Daniel Gamba, head of iShares Americas institutional business, in an interview. But currency hedging, which can protect against a rising U.S. dollar, can also limit potential gains if the U.S. dollar weakens against a foreign currency. “When you’re looking to hedge or mitigate a certain source of risk, in this case currency risk, you’re also simultaneously hedging or dampening the associated source of return, be it positive or negative,” said Ben Johnson, a Chicago-based ETF analyst at Morningstar. “It’s important to understand what the tradeoff implies.” With these new ETFs, BlackRock joins WisdomTree Investments Inc and Deutsche Bank AG’s asset and wealth management business in an area of the ETF market that saw significant inflows in 2013. Investors poured roughly $9.8 billion into WisdomTree’s Japan Hedged Equity Fund last year, making it one of the biggest ETF asset gatherers in 2013. BlackRock, which bought the iShares ETF business from Barclays in 2009, currently has 30 internationally-domiciled currency-hedged ETFs, the oldest of which were launched a decade ago in Canada. These new ETFs will be the first U.S.-listed currency-hedged ETFs for iShares, which plans to launch additional international currency-hedged ETFs later this year. “The way to think about this product is you’ll be able to invest as a local investor,” Gamba said. “If you think the local economy is going to grow more, then hedging the currency will give you a cleaner return and allow you to invest as if you were a local investor in the local market.” The new ETFs track MSCI hedged equity indexes, which include exposure to local industries, including telecommunications and utility sectors.

527,BLK,Schwab rolls out 401(k) platform using exchange-traded funds,"NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Charles Schwab Corp is taking broader aim at the  retirement market with a new 401(k) platform that will allow participants to invest 100 percent of their plan in low-cost exchange-traded funds. Schwab, which already has 401(k) programs using traditional mutual funds, said the new all-ETF platform is designed to reduce investment expenses for investors. An ETF on the new platform, for example, would cost roughly $7 to $10 for every $10,000 invested, while an index mutual fund might cost $14 to $15 for every $10,000 invested and an actively managed mutual fund might cost $70 for every $10,000 invested. “To ignore ETFs would be a mistake in the 401(k) market,” Steve Anderson, head of Schwab Retirement Plan Services, said in an interview ahead of the launch. ETFs track a basket of securities such as stocks, commodities or bonds. Schwab’s new all-ETF 401(k) platform will include 27 asset classes, compared with 17 asset classes offered on its Schwab Index Advantage mutual fund platform, and offer the ability to tap into a broader set of asset classes such as global real estate, precious metals, and emerging markets bonds. The new all-ETF platform is likely initially to attract smaller retirement plans, which could benefit from a lower-cost alternative, said Mike Alfred, head of San Diego-based research firm BrightScope. “Plans over $1 billion in general are already very efficient” in achieving lower costs through economies of scale, Alfred said. “Historically, plans under $10 million have been under served in the sense that providers available to them are significantly more expensive,” he said. “That’s where this might be an opportunity for them.” The increased use of ETFs in 401(k) plans could also pave the way for more growth in the swelling ETF market, which has amassed $2.4 trillion in global assets but still accounts for less than 1 percent of assets in the retirement market, which has largely been dominated by mutual funds. “There’s never been an all-ETF, intraday trading, record-keeping platform rolled out at any scale,” Alfred said. That has slowed adoption of ETFs in 401(k) plans in the past. The roughly 80 ETFs offered on the Schwab 401(k) platform come from 11 different providers, including BlackRock Inc’s  iShares, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard, in addition to Schwab’s own proprietary funds. By expanding into the ETF market, San Francisco-based Schwab is also looking to expand its retirement business, which has about $105 billion in assets and 1.3 million participants in the unit run by Anderson. Users of Schwab’s all-ETF platform will automatically be enrolled in an advisory service - for an additional $45 for every $10,000 invested - with the option to opt out, the same as its index mutual fund users.",2052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/schwab-etfs/schwab-rolls-out-401-platform-using-exchange-traded-funds-idUSL2N0L918E20140205
528,BLK,Emerging market turmoil keeps pressure on commodity ETPs: BlackRock,"LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging markets turmoil drove investors away from commodity exchange traded products (ETPs) in January due to concerns about demand growth, but gold outflows slowed as its safe haven status was revived. Some $1.7 billion was withdrawn from commodity ETPs in January global data from BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, showed. ETPs, whose value is linked to moves in their underlying assets, offer an easy route into commodities and allow asset managers to make quick, tactical shifts. Emerging market assets faced intense selling pressure last month following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to wind down its monetary stimulus. This will remove some of the cheap money that has flooded into developing economies over the last five years in search of better returns. Emerging market equity ETPs ended January with $10 billion of outflows, the largest monthly outflows on record, BlackRock said. Investors were particularly concerned about countries with high current account deficits - Brazil, Indonesia, India, Turkey and South Africa. “A number of central banks in developing countries have tried to stem the general flight to quality by raising interest rates, but this has largely served to increase worries over growth and stability for weaker economies,” BlackRock said. If growth weakens, this could reduce the demand for energy, agriculture and base metals. A softer-than-expected Chinese manufacturing PMI reading of 49.6 contributed to the sell-off, as this confirmed lingering fears of a slowdown in domestic demand, BlackRock added. Meanwhile gold ETP outflows slowed to $860 million from $3.6 billion in December. “Investors turned to gold as emerging markets turmoil accelerated,” said Nick Brooks, head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities, an issuer of ETPs. “We saw that in the price performance. It was one of the few assets to see a positive return in January.” The S&P; GSCI Gold index was up 3.1 percent in January, whilst the S&P; 500 was down 3.6 percent, its worst monthly decline since May 2012. Gold also outperformed bonds and the dollar. Brooks noted that inflows into gold ETPs on the ETF Securities platform hit their highest level in five months in the week ending January 30, at $44 million. Silver attracted global net inflows in January of $55 million after starting the year at below $19 an ounce. “It’s seen as a good entry point,” Brooks said. “And with the gold price stabilizing and starting to rise, silver is seen as a higher beta way to play this improving sentiment towards gold.” Silver has a higher volatility than gold so if gold is expected to rise, tactical investors will often move into silver more aggressively, he said. Surprisingly given the emerging markets sell off, industrial metals ended the month with net inflows of $143 million, but Brooks said this masked a change in sentiment mid-month. In early January, there were strong flows into copper and nickel but these tailed off as emerging market problems mounted. The S&P; GSCI industrial metals index was down 4.3 percent in January, with aluminum suffering the biggest hit. On the energy side investors pulled money from natural gas ETPs after strong price gains due to weeks of sub-zero temperatures in North America, which ran down stocks. “We saw some big inflows into natural gas ETPs at the end of 2013 and now they are selling to make a nice return,” Brooks said. In February investors have continued to put money into gold ETPs, there have been inflows into short natural gas ETPs and some flows into coffee and sugar, according to data from ETF Securities. “But we need to see some stabilization of the situation in emerging markets before investors are ready to move in more aggressively,” Brooks said. At the end of January BlackRock’s data covered 898 commodity ETPs worldwide, worth some $114.6 billion.

529,BLK,BlackRock expands retirement business with new bond funds,"NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, is expanding its push into the retirement market with a new set of bond funds tied to indexes that track an individual’s expected annual retirement income once he or she reaches age 65. The new funds, which BlackRock is targeting at investors over 55, are linked to a series of retirement benchmark indexes the company launched in July. The index series, called CoRI Indexes, allow pre-retirees to calculate an estimate of how much their current savings would produce in annual income when they turn 65, or conversely, how much they would need to save to reach a certain annual lifetime income level upon retiring. “We designed CoRI to be an investable index,” said Chip Castille, head of BlackRock’s U.S. retirement group, in a press briefing in New York on Wednesday. The five new funds are the first in the series, with maturity dates in 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023. The idea is that upon reaching age 65, investors can choose to liquidate their holdings in the fund and invest in another lifetime income product, such as an annuity, or can stay in the funds for another 10 years, until they turn 75, at which point the funds liquidate and they receive the remaining investment. The new funds are what Castille describes as “plain vanilla” bond funds, comprised primarily of U.S. Treasuries and high-quality corporate bonds. Castille said other firms may be able to license the CoRI indexes using their patents, and BlackRock is already talking with other fund companies. BlackRock, which has the fourth-largest franchise in the defined contribution industry in terms of assets in its plans, said it had $30 billion in net inflows into its defined contribution channel last year, increasing its total assets in the unit to $525 billion. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink has said that defined contribution and retirement planning are among top priorities for the New York-based asset manager. BlackRock introduced Castille’s U.S. retirement group in January and said it would be focusing on product development and services geared toward individual investors.",2122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-funds-retirement/blackrock-expands-retirement-business-with-new-bond-funds-idUSL2N0LH12D20140212

544,BLK,BlackRock warns over 'major uncertainties' of Scottish independence,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest money manager, warned that Scottish independence would bring about “major uncertainties, costs and risks” in Britain, becoming the latest company to join the debate on this year’s referendum. Scotland will vote on whether to end its 307-year union with England in September. The British government has been campaigning fiercely to keep it intact, arguing that both countries are better off together, while Scotland’s nationalists believe a split would give them the economic freedom to prosper. “(A ‘Yes’ vote) would create risks for investors, corporations, savers and the UK economy,” BlackRock said in a detailed report for professional clients, adding that investors in gilts, banks, utilities and energy companies would be most affected. It said there could be limited pressure on gilt prices due to the small probability of Scotland finding it difficult to meet its obligations to England at some point in the future. But weighing out the potential impact of independence on gilts in four scenarios, BlackRock concluded that there would be no material risk for Britain’s debtholders unless Scotland defaulted on its share of the liability. BlackRock said independence would raise regulatory costs for banks and insurers that would move employees to England to avoid having to pay additional fees to a new Scottish regulator. Major banks would also question whether or not Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) should remain based in Scotland, BlackRock said, as Britain’s support to the bank since 2008 has totaled more than 210 percent of Scotland’s gross domestic product. The New York-based investment manager highlighted the impact of other major issues that had to be settled, including Scotland’s opening balance sheet, the division of its hydrocarbon bounty, European Union membership, tax matters, and choosing a currency. Weighing the costs and benefits of Scotland’s three currency options, BlackRock ranked Scotland launching its own currency above keeping the British pound or joining the euro.

545,BLK,"BlackRock warns over ""major uncertainties"" of Scottish independence","March 23 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, warned that Scottish independence would bring about “major uncertainties, costs and risks” in Britain, becoming the latest company to join the debate on this year’s referendum. Scotland will vote on whether to end its 307-year union with England in September. The British government has been campaigning fiercely to keep it intact, arguing that both countries are better off together, while Scotland’s nationalists believe a split would give them the economic freedom to prosper. “(A ‘Yes’ vote) would create risks for investors, corporations, savers and the UK economy,” BlackRock said in a detailed report for professional clients, adding that investors in gilts, banks, utilities and energy companies would be most affected. It said there could be limited pressure on gilt prices due to the small probability of Scotland finding it difficult to meet its obligations to England at some point in the future. But weighing out the potential impact of independence on gilts in four scenarios, BlackRock concluded that there would be no material risk for Britain’s debtholders unless Scotland defaulted on its share of the liability. BlackRock said independence would raise regulatory costs for banks and insurers that would move employees to England to avoid having to pay additional fees to a new Scottish regulator. Major banks would also question whether or not Royal Bank of Scotland should remain based in Scotland, BlackRock said, as Britain’s support to the bank since 2008 has totalled more than 210 percent of Scotland’s gross domestic product. The New York-based investment manager highlighted the impact of other major issues that had to be settled, including Scotland’s opening balance sheet, the division of its hydrocarbon bounty, European Union membership, tax matters, and choosing a currency. Weighing the costs and benefits of Scotland’s three currency options, BlackRock ranked Scotland launching its own currency above keeping the British pound or joining the euro. BlackRock, which manages more than $4 trillion in assets, said it expected Scotland’s initial credit rating to possibly be several notches below Britain’s. It added that credit investors would factor the uncertainty of “volatile” North Sea oil revenue into yields and that it was “probably unwise” to base fiscal spending on crudes that depend so critically on energy prices, production volumes, costs and tax incentives. “The current Scottish Government will be hard-pressed to deliver many of its promised outcomes,” the investment manager said, adding that negotiations would likely drag beyond the 2016 timetable.

Many top corporations have faced pressure from Wall Street analysts, activist investors and others to increase dividends, buy back shares or take other steps to return capital to investors, sooner rather than later.

550,BLK,UPDATE 1-U.S. SEC inches closer to money market fund final rule,"(Adds more details throughout about the SEC’s money market fund plan) By Sarah N. Lynch March 26 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators are inching closer to completing new rules for money market funds, though no final decision on how to proceed has been made just yet, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Securities and Exchange Commission staff in charge of the rulewriting has been meeting with the agency’s five commissioners, circulating some documents that highlight potential courses of actions and sounding them out to get their thoughts, the person said. The SEC is still actively eyeing a plan that would force prime institutional money market funds to abandon their stable $1 per-share net asset value and float their share price. In response to some complaints from the industry, the SEC is also exploring whether to make some changes from its initial proposal that could effectively expand the number of money market funds that would be exempt from a floating net asset value, the person added. The SEC has been exploring ways to reform the $2.6 trillion money market fund industry as a direct response to the financial crisis. In 2008, exposures to Lehman Brothers caused a large prime institutional fund known as the Reserve Primary Fund to have its net asset value dip below $1, an event known as “breaking the buck.” Spooked investors rushed to get their money out, and the U.S. government ultimately stepped in to prop up the money market fund industry until the panic subsided. The SEC’s proposal, first released last summer, is aimed at preventing similar runs. In addition to proposing a floating NAV for prime funds, the plan also contemplates an alternative which would permit fund boards to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates during times of stress. The SEC could potentially adopt one of the two options alone or in combination. The source added that the proposal for gates and fees are also still on the table as well. Earlier this week, the SEC released four new economic analyses on money market funds that it is using to help inform a final rule and asked the public to submit feedback on the studies. SEC Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar said on Wednesday that he is advocating internally for the SEC to allow funds to choose which option they prefer. “My idea is, rather than us choosing for everybody, why don’t we allow for both options to be offered and then investors can choose which one they want?” Piwowar said on the sidelines of an SEC event. “I call it the investor choice model, or the belts or suspenders model,” he added. It is unclear if his idea could gain traction. A majority of the five commissioners must agree before a rule can be adopted. As part of the SEC’s internal discussions, staff is discussing making changes that would broaden an exemption for retail money market funds from having to float their share price. Retail funds were always supposed to be exempted from the floating NAV plan because they are considered less at risk for runs. But many in the industry have said that how the SEC defined retail is problematic. In October, nine fund management companies including Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard and Wells Fargo  proposed an alternative definition of retail. Under the SEC’s plan, a fund would be considered retail if it prohibits a shareholder from redeeming more than $1 million per business day. The nine companies have urged the SEC to instead define a retail fund as one that “limits beneficial ownership interest to natural persons” such as individuals who are investing in money funds through individual accounts or retirement accounts. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the SEC’s internal deliberations concerning broadening the retail exemption.   (Reporting by Sarah N.

554,BLK,"BlackRock picks Philippines, Indonesia as top share hunting ground","HONG KONG (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s biggest money manager, said improving economic indicators in Indonesia and consistent corporate earnings in the Philippines make those two countries prime hunting grounds for Southeast Asian stocks. Indonesia has slashed its current-account deficit and tamed inflation, strengthening its previously ailing currency. In the Philippines, companies have met forecasts more often than the rest of Asia during a period of successive sovereign credit rating upgrades. Immediate beneficiaries of economic growth include consumer, financial and infrastructure shares. These make up more than half of BlackRock’s $244 million ASEAN Leaders Fund which features stocks such as Indonesian state-controlled lender Bank Mandiri Persero Tbk PT (BMRI.JK) and conglomerate Astra International Tbk PT (ASII.JK). Southeast Asian markets saw sharp volatility last year when investors pulled out in anticipation of tighter liquidity as the U.S. Federal Reserve winds down economic stimulus. Interest has since returned, with Indonesia's main stock index .JKSE rising 18 percent in dollar terms this year, the highest in Asia. “In an environment where we are sort of pulling back on liquidity with (Fed) tapering, there was an initial shock in these countries and currencies,” said head of Asian equities Andrew Swan at the Reuters ASEAN Summit in Hong Kong. “But current account deficits are declining and trade surpluses are increasing. And that’s been quite pleasing I think for many people to see that it’s actually happened reasonably quickly, and that’s why money is coming back.” BlackRock’s Indonesian investments amounted to less than its benchmark index for most of last year. Last month, however, Swan raised the proportion of Indonesian securities in BlackRock’s ASEAN fund to 20.2 percent, 1.5 percentage points higher than the MSCI South East Asia Index, according to the fund factsheet. The proportion of Philippine securities was 8.6 percent which, at 2 percentage points higher than the benchmark, was the fund’s boldest exposure. Indonesian and Philippine shares currently trade at nearly 3.5 times and 3 times their book value - or companies’ total value - indicating they are the most expensive in Asia. Shares in the rest of the region, excluding Japan, average 1.4 times. The stock may be expensive, but Swan said earnings per Philippine share so far in 2014 have been similar to earnings over the past two-and-a-half years, whereas elsewhere in Asia ex-Japan earnings on average have been 25 percent lower. Increased investment in the Philippines, resilient income growth and a current account surplus - indicating more money coming into the country than going out - suggests a chance of future earnings exceeding analyst estimates, Swan said. In Indonesia, swift economic adjustment came as a surprise, Swan said. The current account deficit is narrowing, suggesting “we are getting through the worst of the adjustment process.” The deficit in the fourth quarter was about 2 percent of gross domestic product. That compared with a record 4.4 percent six months before, and was the narrowest since the second quarter of 2012. BlackRock’s ASEAN Leaders Fund returned 2.2 percent in the first two months of 2014, outperforming a 1.6 percent gain in its benchmark MSCI South East Asia index. The fund returned 1.7 percent last year when its benchmark was down 4.5 percent and fund peers lost 5.3 percent, according to data compiled by global fund tracker Thomson Reuters Lipper.

560,BLK,"BlackRock shakes up management, names new co-president, COO: memo","NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest money manager, is reorganizing its senior management, shifting at least 10 senior executives into new or different roles, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Sunday. Both Larry Fink, chief executive and chairman of BlackRock, which has more than $4 trillion in assets under management, and Rob Kapito, president, will stay in their roles. Charlie Hallac, who while not a founding member of BlackRock but was the company’s first employee in 1988, will become co-president, the memo said. BlackRock is scheduled to report its first quarter financial results on April 17. The company said it does not have any further comment beyond what is included in the memo. Hallac, who is battling colon cancer, is currently chief operating officer. He was one of the original architects of BlackRock’s Aladdin trading platform and will be forming a new group to focus on broadening and integrating that technology more into the company’s retail segment. New York-based BlackRock’s client businesses, investment groups and product management will continue to report to Hallac and Kapito. Rob Goldstein, a 20-year BlackRock veteran and current global head of the asset management firm’s institutional client business, will fill the role of COO, as of June 1. Mark McCombe was named global head of the institutional client unit, based in New York. He is currently chairman of BlackRock Asia Pacific, a role he will keep until the end of the year. McCombe will also become chairman of BlackRock Alternative Investors. BlackRock said in the memo the shuffle fits into its strategy of the past five years of challenging its executives by putting them in roles that broaden their horizons and maximize their impact with the firm and its clients. “Periodically moving leaders to new roles as part of this process was a key rationale for the re-organization of the firm in 2012 and is a key driver of the management changes we are announcing today,” the memo said. In 2012, the company expanded its senior leadership team and reorganized its investment and client-facing businesses in an effort to spur organic growth. In that move, BlackRock replaced its portfolio management group with five new investment groups. Other moves announced on Sunday include the promotion of Rich Kushel to chief product officer. Kushel is currently head of strategic product management. He will also continue to oversee the BlackRock Investment Institute and the company’s corporate governance and responsible investment team. Ryan Stork, global head of the Aladdin business within BlackRock Solutions, will become head of BlackRock Asia Pacific, based in Hong Kong, beginning next year. Ken Wilson moves to the role of chairman of Alpha Strategies at BlackRock, after serving as chairman of BlackRock Alternative Investors since its creation. BlackRock said Salim Ramji, a Senior Partner at McKinsey & Company, will join the firm later this month as global head of corporate strategy. Patrick Olson, who is global head of strategy and planning, will become COO of Europe the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and join the EMEA executive committee. BlackRock said it was not making any changes to portfolio managers or client relationship managers.

574,BLK,BlackRock's quarterly profit climbs as investors pile into funds,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, said on Thursday first-quarter profit rose 20 percent, boosted by strong performance fees and strength in its retail business as investors poured money into long-term funds. The New York-based asset manager, which now manages $4.4 trillion in assets, said it had positive net flows across equity, fixed-income, alternatives and multi-asset funds during the quarter. “Even with all of the turmoil in the markets that we saw a few weeks ago, every day during that turmoil, we had net inflows,” Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview on Thursday, referring to the company’s retail client base. Fink noted most of that turmoil was due to “fast money” exits, with hedge funds moving out of their positions rather than any broad-based selling among long-term investors. Revenue at BlackRock grew 9 percent to $2.67 billion, with revenue generated by performance fees paid by investors for outsized earnings in some funds surging 46.3 percent to $158 million from a year earlier. BlackRock’s quarterly results exceeded Wall Street estimates, but analysts tempered that beat by noting that some of the upside came from non-operating drivers and larger-than-expected gains on investments. “It was certainly a fine quarter from an earnings standpoint, but these performance fees and expense items are certainly lumpy and some of them are one time in nature,” said Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan. Shares of BlackRock were down 0.7 percent at $307.95 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Of the $26.7 billion that investors poured into long-term funds during the quarter, roughly half came from retail investors who accounted for $14 billion of long-term net inflows during the quarter. Retail fund assets at the end of March totaled $508.7 billion, representing 12 percent of total assets under management at the end of March. While institutional investors put money into lower-fee institutional index funds, they pulled money out of actively managed funds. Institutional investors had net outflows of $8 billion from actively managed equity funds and $7 billion from actively managed fixed-income during the quarter. That could be a concern going forward, according to Edward Jones’ Shanahan. Most of the growth delivered during the quarter was in lower-fee institutional index portfolios rather than actively managed funds and other high-fee products, he said. BlackRock has remained largely insulated from the market volatility experienced in early 2014, because its broad menu of investment products, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds span various asset classes and world regions, analysts say. BlackRock’s strong performance through the market volatility “highlights the flexibility of their model and their ability to drive revenue from different sources of their business,” said Gabelli & Co analyst Macrae Sykes. Investors poured $15.6 billion into BlackRock’s fixed-income funds and $3.8 billion into equity funds. They added $5 billion to multi-asset portfolios, while adding $2.3 billion to alternative funds. With the bulk of long-term net inflows going into fixed-income during the quarter, Fink noted that much of the investor interest there has shifted toward “unconstrained” fixed-income products that are not targeted to any duration. A lot of those flows are driven by money moving into defined contribution plans and the de-risking of pension plans, he said. BlackRock’s strength in fixed-income comes as rival bond-market money manager Pimco has been shedding assets. In a research report on Monday titled “Investors Return to the Bond Market, Just Not to Pimco,” Morningstar’s Michael Rawson said Pimco Total Return Fund saw a net $3.1 billion outflow in March while intermediate-term bond funds had a $7.4 billion inflow for the same time period. Fink, when asked about Pimco, said he doesn’t comment on competitors, but said BlackRock is in a “great position” with both institutional and retail clients. And analysts see the giant money manager playing a bigger role in fixed-income. “There’s an ability (for BlackRock) to take share in fixed-income, given what we’ve seen on the competitive landscape with some of the bigger firms” in the industry, Sykes said. BlackRock has been working to strengthen its U.S. active equity business, which has lagged in recent quarters. In all, institutional investors pulled $12.6 billion from active funds, with the bulk of those outflows coming from active equity and fixed-income. BlackRock has been working on bulking up its U.S. active equity business, but said “it will take time to build long-term track records.” The company last month named JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Christopher Jones as chief investment officer (CIO) for stocks in the Americas to head BlackRock’s Fundamental Active Equity team in the Americas. Jones, formerly CIO for JPMorgan Asset Management’s growth and small-cap U.S. equity team, will also be the global co-head of fundamental equity, alongside Nigel Bolton, head of BlackRock’s European equity team. Analysts are looking for more growth in the company’s actively managed and higher-fee products, rather than lower-fee index funds. “Flows are certainly volatile, but this concentration of flows in institutional index funds is in my mind a negative development and continues this pressure on weighted average fee rates,” Edward Jones’ Shanahan said. BlackRock earlier this month announced a reorganization of its senior management ranks as it works towards an eventual succession plan for Fink, 61. The company said it would be shifting at least 10 senior executives into new or expanded roles in June as it seeks to groom its next generation of potential successors to Fink. But Fink reiterated on Thursday that he has no plans to depart anytime soon. “I’m not going anywhere,” he said. “It was just a continuation of our building out our bench.” The idea of the reorganization is to allow senior managers to take on greater responsibility and gain a broader experience within different divisions of the company, he said. BlackRock reported net income of $756 million, or $4.40 per share, up from $632 million, or $3.62 per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain long-term compensation expenses and other one-time items, earnings were $4.43 a share.

575,BLK,UPDATE 4-BlackRock's quarterly profit climbs as investors pile into funds,"(Adds financial details throughout, updates share price) By Ashley Lau NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, said on Thursday first-quarter profit rose 20 percent, boosted by strong performance fees and strength in its retail business as investors poured money into long-term funds. The New York-based asset manager, which now manages $4.4 trillion in assets, said it had positive net flows across equity, fixed-income, alternatives and multi-asset funds during the quarter. “Even with all of the turmoil in the markets that we saw a few weeks ago, every day during that turmoil, we had net inflows,” Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview on Thursday, referring to the company’s retail client base. Fink noted most of that turmoil was due to “fast money” exits, with hedge funds moving out of their positions rather than any broad-based selling among long-term investors. Revenue at BlackRock grew 9 percent to $2.67 billion, with revenue generated by performance fees paid by investors for outsized earnings in some funds surging 46.3 percent to $158 million from a year earlier. BlackRock’s quarterly results exceeded Wall Street estimates, but analysts tempered that beat by noting that some of the upside came from non-operating drivers and larger-than-expected gains on investments. “It was certainly a fine quarter from an earnings standpoint, but these performance fees and expense items are certainly lumpy and some of them are one time in nature,” said Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan. Shares of BlackRock were down 0.7 percent at $307.95 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Of the $26.7 billion that investors poured into long-term funds during the quarter, roughly half came from retail investors who accounted for $14 billion of long-term net inflows during the quarter. Retail fund assets at the end of March totaled $508.7 billion, representing 12 percent of total assets under management at the end of March. While institutional investors put money into lower-fee institutional index funds, they pulled money out of actively managed funds. Institutional investors had net outflows of $8 billion from actively managed equity funds and $7 billion from actively managed fixed-income during the quarter. That could be a concern going forward, according to Edward Jones’ Shanahan. Most of the growth delivered during the quarter was in lower-fee institutional index portfolios rather than actively managed funds and other high-fee products, he said. BlackRock has remained largely insulated from the market volatility experienced in early 2014, because its broad menu of investment products, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds span various asset classes and world regions, analysts say. BlackRock’s strong performance through the market volatility “highlights the flexibility of their model and their ability to drive revenue from different sources of their business,” said Gabelli & Co analyst Macrae Sykes. Investors poured $15.6 billion into BlackRock’s fixed-income funds and $3.8 billion into equity funds. They added $5 billion to multi-asset portfolios, while adding $2.3 billion to alternative funds. With the bulk of long-term net inflows going into fixed-income during the quarter, Fink noted that much of the investor interest there has shifted toward “unconstrained” fixed-income products that are not targeted to any duration. A lot of those flows are driven by money moving into defined contribution plans and the de-risking of pension plans, he said. BlackRock’s strength in fixed-income comes as rival bond-market money manager Pimco has been shedding assets. In a research report on Monday titled “Investors Return to the Bond Market, Just Not to Pimco,” Morningstar’s Michael Rawson said Pimco Total Return Fund saw a net $3.1 billion outflow in March while intermediate-term bond funds had a $7.4 billion inflow for the same time period. Fink, when asked about Pimco, said he doesn’t comment on competitors, but said BlackRock is in a “great position” with both institutional and retail clients. And analysts see the giant money manager playing a bigger role in fixed-income. “There’s an ability (for BlackRock) to take share in fixed-income, given what we’ve seen on the competitive landscape with some of the bigger firms” in the industry, Sykes said. BlackRock has been working to strengthen its U.S. active equity business, which has lagged in recent quarters. In all, institutional investors pulled $12.6 billion from active funds, with the bulk of those outflows coming from active equity and fixed-income. BlackRock has been working on bulking up its U.S. active equity business, but said “it will take time to build long-term track records.” The company last month named JPMorgan Chase & Co’s  Christopher Jones as chief investment officer (CIO) for stocks in the Americas to head BlackRock’s Fundamental Active Equity team in the Americas.

578,BLK,BlackRock cuts stake in Italian lender Monte Paschi,"MILAN (Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock (BLK.N) has cut its stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) less than a month after becoming the Italian bank’s single biggest shareholder, raising questions over who will buy into the lender’s imminent capital increase. A regulatory filing on Wednesday showed that U.S. group BlackRock (BLK.N) cut its stake in Italy’s third-biggest bank to 3.23 percent from 5.75 pct on April 15, the day shares in Monte Paschi fell 10 percent on expectations that it would raise the size of its cash call. A statement from the bank that day said it was evaluating its capital needs after a media report said that it may increase the size of its rights issue from a planned 3 billion euros ($4.14 billion). Last Friday the bank’s board approved an increase in the cash call to 5 billion euros as it strives to repay state aid and prepares for this year’s stress tests on euro zone lenders. It expects to complete the rights issue by mid-July. BlackRock bought Monte dei Paschi shares on March 18 from a banking foundation that was then the lender’s top investor. It became the bank’s leading shareholder at the end of last month as the foundation cut its holding further to repay debt. The world’s largest money manager has become a leading investor in several large Italian banks in recent weeks as cheap Italian banking stocks have attracted investors willing to bet on a tentative economic recovery and widespread reforms by new Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to boost growth.

581,BLK,Fidelity rolls out new ETF managed account with BlackRock,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc, already partners in the exchange-traded funds market, are teaming up once again to launch a new ETF-heavy managed account aimed at providing income for investors preparing for retirement. The new BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio, which will be roughly 70 percent invested in ETFs, will be available beginning May 1 exclusively to the roughly 14 million retail customers who have Fidelity brokerage accounts, the company said on Thursday. Under the arrangement with BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager and a leader in the $2.4 trillion global ETF industry, Fidelity, the second largest U.S. mutual fund firm, will serve as the investment adviser to the managed account. The new offering propels Fidelity into the fast-growing ETF managed account universe, which totaled around $96 billion in assets at the end of December, according to a tally of managed portfolio strategies tracked by research firm Morningstar. Morningstar defines ETF-managed portfolios as those with at least 50 percent of its assets invested ETFs. Fidelity’s new managed account also expands the role of ETFs as investments used in preparing individuals for retirement. “We have millions of customers in the pre-retiree category concerned about retirement income and making that money last through retirement,” said Kathy Murphy, president of Fidelity Personal Investing, in an interview. “We think it will be very helpful to that specific segment of the market.” A managed account is a fee-based investment. Annual advisory fees on the new Fidelity managed account will be between 0.55 percent and 1.1 percent of total assets invested, depending on the size of the investment. The bulk of the new portfolio will be invested in iShares ETFs, with the rest in mutual funds, Master Limited Partnerships and other investment vehicles. It will have a “go-anywhere” mandate allowing the manager to stuff it with a variety of assets from around the world. Fidelity currently has about $158 billion in total assets under management in its managed accounts business, largely in mutual funds and other investments. BlackRock will serve as the portfolio strategist for the new managed account, overseeing asset allocation, with Fidelity as the investment adviser for its customers’ individual accounts. It is the latest ETF collaboration from the two firms, which first partnered in 2010 when Fidelity began offering BlackRock’s iShares ETFs commission-free on its platform, and have been expanding their ETF relationship in recent years. Fidelity last year increased the number of BlackRock iShares ETFs offered on its platform to 65 from 30, and introduced its first full slate of sector ETFs in October with BlackRock as its sub-adviser. The partnership allows Fidelity to further expand into the $1.7 trillion U.S. ETF market and gives BlackRock access to Fidelity’s vast distribution platform. Since Fidelity increased its iShares offering last year, investments in the iShares ETFs on its platform increased 86 percent from the year prior, with the number of Fidelity accounts holding iShares ETFs up 16 percent, the company said.

The move is, in part, a way to boost trading and liquidity in the bond market at a time when Wall Street banks have cut back on providing liquidity and have shed their holdings of corporate debt and mortgages because of tighter regulation of capital requirements. “Given regulatory and workflow pressures in the rates and derivatives markets, partnering with Tradeweb to aggregate liquidity and increase efficiencies in trading is a natural extension” of the platform, the incoming head of BlackRock’s Aladdin business, Sudhir Nair, said in a statement. In addition to gaining access to pricing and historical information, Aladdin clients will be able to “click to trade” from their dashboard, said BlackRock spokeswoman Lauren Post. While users will be able to make transactions on the Aladdin screen, all of the actual trading will happen at Tradeweb, she said.

588,BLK,U.S. regulatory panel will not find problems with risk modeling firms-BlackRock,"WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators’ concerns about the market relying too heavily on the same risk models provided by a handful of financial firms will be “debunked,” a top executive at asset manager BlackRock said on Monday. There is no evidence to support concerns that the market may be overly dependent on the same models because there is a lot of competition, said Vice Chair Barbara Novick of BlackRock , which offers such models. Risk is not concentrated in just a handful of third party providers, added Novick, who spoke at a panel discussion. “There are many of them. The fact there are many of them tells you there is choice, and people can migrate from one to another,” she said at a conference convened by the Financial Stability Oversight Council to explore whether asset managers and their activities could pose risks. “While it is worth looking at...I think in the long-term it will be debunked,” Novick said at the conference held by the FSOC,  chaired by U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew tasked with policing the market for emerging threats. Last week, Reuters exclusively reported that FSOC staffers in March proposed the idea of creating score cards for third party risk modeling firms, amid concerns the market may be too dependent on the same products. [ID: nL1N0O001I] Such third party firms provide a range of services, including asset valuation, investment advice and risk measurements to pension funds, asset managers, insurance agencies and banks. BlackRock’s unit, known as BlackRock Solutions, is one of the market leaders in the risk modeling business, and FSOC staffers highlighted the various services it provides to investors in a closed-door regulatory meeting on March 25 about third-party service providers. Documents reviewed by Reuters laid out the government’s concern that financial firms may rely too heavily on the same outside risk models and valuations, and that any flaws could result in a wide misunderstanding of the true risk of firms’ investments and other assets. Flawed risk models played a major role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Financial firms’ internal modeling and assessments from credit rating agencies did not anticipate the systemic effect that a significant drop in housing prices could have on global markets. The issue grabbed the spotlight again in 2012 when JPMorgan Chase & Co’s risk models failed to capture the dangers of its “London Whale” trades that led to a $6.2 billion loss. Using BlackRock Solutions as an example, the staffers created a draft scorecard for the company that focused on risk factors such as user reliance on its investment decision and valuation services, and the amount of assets and liabilities. A Treasury spokeswoman previously told Reuters that the  proposed scorecard approach is consistent with the council’s mandate to look at issues across the financial system. She added that no decisions have been made on the approach, that it is not designed for any particular company or industry, and should not be read into.   (Reporting by Sarah N.

589,BLK,UPDATE 1-BlackRock advances in pursuit of ETFs with non-daily disclosure,"(Adds context and details on ETFs) By Ashley Lau NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the largest U.S. provider of exchange-traded funds, has moved a step further toward launching a new breed of ETFs that would be allowed to keep holdings under wraps for months, instead of the daily disclosure now required. A filing late on Friday from BATS Global Markets, which seeks approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to list and trade shares of some funds, is tied to a trust that BlackRock plans to use to launch these so-called “non-transparent” active ETFs. The funds in the BATS filing include 13 potential BlackRock iShares non-transparent active ETFs, mainly large and mid-cap equity funds. Such funds, if approved, would be allowed to report their holdings on a quarterly basis, putting them on par with traditional mutual funds. The BATS filing, known as a Form 19b-4, is required in order for such actively managed funds to be listed on an exchange. It follows an earlier proposal submitted in September 2011 by BlackRock asking the SEC to allow them to build such funds. For  BlackRock to be able to launch non-transparent active ETFs, both proposals would need to be approved. BlackRock and BATS declined to comment on the filing. ETFs hold a basket of securities, such as equities, commodities or bonds, and can be traded on exchanges like stocks. Most “passive” ETFs seek to mirror the holdings of rules-based indexes, while “active” ETFs have holdings that can be actively selected by managers. Currently, all ETFs, both active and passive, are required to disclose their holdings daily. This allows the funds’ market makers to make trades that keep the fund’s share price in line with the value of its underlying assets. But for actively managed funds, which often gain a reputation based on a manager’s winning investment philosophy, daily transparency could allow others to “front-run” the active manager. Firms say non-transparent ETFs will allow them to use sophisticated investment strategies without having to reveal the fund manager’s secret sauce. The BlackRock proposal, for example, includes a “blind trust” through which a market maker or authorized participant could execute orders, so that the manager would not have to  disclose the fund’s holdings daily. The model is based on a concept created by Bedminster, New Jersey-based Precidian Investments, which also has a proposal in front of the SEC. “We’re very encouraged by the recent filing,” said Stuart Thomas, a principal at Precidian, noting that the increase in activity in the non-transparent active ETF space “would seem to mean that people have a lot more confidence today” about the funds eventually coming to market. Several other large asset managers, including State Street Corp and Eaton Vance Corp, have also asked the SEC to let them market such actively managed ETFs. So far, none of the proposals have won SEC approval.

593,BLK,"S&P;, BlackRock plan 'smart' bond indexes and funds","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Companies such as BlackRock Inc and Standard & Poor’s are taking a popular stock fund strategy and applying it to bonds. For more than a decade, asset managers have been creating stock funds that track indexes designed to outperform those based on their components’ market value. Bond funds are the next frontier for index designers who use this “smart beta” approach to boost returns by taking advantage of market inefficiencies. S&P; Dow Jones Indices, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial, said it expects to unveil smart beta bond indexes in the fourth quarter. BlackRock has not given a timetable, but is experimenting with different ways of weighting components of the broad Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index to produce exchange-traded funds based on new indexes, said Daniel Gamba, head of Americas institutional iShares business at BlackRock. Traditional bond indexes are dominated by issuers with the most outstanding debt. Smart beta indexes reduce this risk by giving more weight to factors such as corporate cash flow or economic growth rates of countries. That would skew an index toward issuers that may better service their debt, said Shane Shepherd, head of fixed-income research at index developer Research Affiliates. Some approaches more focused on returns also screen out bonds nearing their maturity date. ETF issuers hope smart beta indexes will draw investors worried that rising interest rates could reduce the returns on traditional bond funds. Those investors pulled some $86 billion out of U.S.-listed bond mutual funds last year, and are seeking alternatives. The trend of fund flows “has certainly favored fixed-income ETFs,” said Barry Fennell, an analyst with Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. With roughly $3.7 trillion in all taxable bond mutual funds and only $283.4 billion in taxable bond ETFs, there is plenty of room for growth. “Now, more than ever, the fundamental scheme of not owning the most of a specific issuer, just because they have the most outstanding, makes the most sense,” said David Dziekanski, a portfolio manager at Toroso Investments, which focuses on exchange-traded products. The performance of most of the nine existing smart beta funds is largely in line with the comparable indexes so far this year. One outlier is Invesco’s PowerShares Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt Fund. The oldest smart beta ETF, which screens for maturity, is up 7.3 percent year-to-date, more than double the 3.5 percent return of the comparable, but traditionally weighted, JP Morgan EMBI Global Index. The index it tracks has had an average annual return of 8.6 percent since inception in 2007, compared with 7.7 percent for the JP Morgan index. Smart beta products could also be more profitable for issuers, as they tend to be priced higher than more plain vanilla, broad index ETFs. A traditional Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF costs $8 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested, for example. Several smart beta funds charge about $50 for every $10,000 invested.

595,BLK,UPDATE 1-BlackRock's Thiel says periphery bond holdings lowest in 2 years,"(Adds details, quotes) By John Geddie and Marius Zaharia LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, said on Friday one of its main bond funds had cut its holdings of peripheral euro zone government debt to their lowest since the height of the crisis. Scott Thiel, the firm’s head of European and global bonds,    said it was not only the magnitude of the rally in the bloc’s lower-rated bonds that had prompted his Fixed Income Global Opportunities fund to book profits, but also his reluctance to bet on the European Central Bank starting to print money. “We do remain positive on the European periphery but are cautious in the current environment and our positions in the region are now at their lowest level in over two years,” Thiel, who oversees assets worth around $100 billion for BlackRock,  told Reuters by email. He added he was “not convinced” the ECB would introduce a money-printing asset purchase programme in the euro zone. Expectations the ECB would take action to nurture the bloc’s fragile recovery helped drive Italian, Spanish  and Irish 10-year bond yields to record lows of less than 3 percent last week. Portuguese yields  hit their lowest in over eight years. Yields hit peaks of more than 7 percent at the height of the crisis in 2011 and 2012, before ECB President Mario Draghi said he would do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. The cut in the FIGO fund’s peripheral exposure included trimming a “long-standing” position in Portuguese government bonds. Portugal had been one of the fund’s “highest conviction trades,” Thiel said. BlackRock oversees about $4 trillion and its moves are closely watched by market participants. “It’s one voice within the market but they obviously do move a lot of money,” said Sandra Holdsworth, investment manager at Kames Capital, a group with $63 billion under management. “It is in agreement with a position I’d taken myself, in that the value was less compelling even if the story was still positive. (But) I think the consensus is that the periphery is still quite a good trade to have on.”   (Reporting by John Geddie and Marius Zaharia, editing by Nigel Stephenson)",5232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-bonds-blackrock/update-1-blackrocks-thiel-says-periphery-bond-holdings-lowest-in-2-years-idUSL6N0O932U20140523

598,BLK,BlackRock CEO says leveraged ETFs could 'blow up' whole industry,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said on Wednesday that leveraged exchange-traded funds contain structural problems that could “blow up” the whole industry one day. Fink runs a company that oversees more than $4 trillion in client assets, including nearly $1 trillion in ETF assets. “We’d never do one (a leveraged ETF),” Fink said at a Deutsche Bank investment conference in New York. “They have a structural problem that could blow up the whole industry one day.” Fink spoke during a conversation with Deutsche Bank co-CEO Anshu Jain in a broader discussion about regulating financial companies. ProShares, a leading leveraged ETF firm, disagreed with Fink’s remarks. “Leveraged ETFs are well regulated, transparent products and there is no credible evidence that they have any harmful effect on the markets or our industry,” said Tucker Hewes, a spokesman for ProShares. Leveraged ETFs account for 1.2 percent of the $2.5 trillion in global ETF assets under management. At the end of April, there were nearly 270 leveraged ETF funds with $30.3 billion in assets, said Deborah Fuhr, managing partner of ETF research firm ETFGI LLP.     A leveraged ETF uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. Some leveraged ETFs have become more aggressive, ramping up risk and potential returns, as the ETF industry gains popularity with individual and institutional investors. Leveraged ETFs have attracted $1.8 billion in net new assets during the first four months of 2014, Fuhr said. They are showing up more as buy-and-hold investments in the portfolios of retail investors, as financial advisers grow more comfortable recommending them, and first gained a foothold among traders who wanted an investment vehicle to make fast and enhanced bets on big index moves or the direction of gold prices, for example Last year, when the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 32 percent, the $348 million Direxion Daily S&P; 500 Bull 3x Shares ETF (SPXL.P) gained 118.9 percent, or nearly quadruple the S&P; 500’s gains. Last month, Direxion Funds launched two leveraged ETFs with three times exposure to the daily direction of gold prices. Direxion Daily Gold Bull 3X Shares ETF GLDL.P, for example, seeks 300 percent of the daily performance of the Comex Gold Futures benchmark.  The industry’s largest leveraged ETF is the ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury (TBT.P), which has about $4 billion in assets.  Fink said he believes regulators should focus on the structure of financial products. “If you want to create a safer and sounder marketplace, it has to be at the product level,” Fink said.  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staffers have  issued warnings about leveraged ETFs, though no action has been taken to curb their availability.

604,BLK,BlackRock rejects U.S. concerns on securities lending agreements,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - BlackRock pushed back on Thursday against a U.S. report that raised concerns about asset managers and securities lending, arguing in a paper sent to regulators that its activities do not pose outsized risks. At issue are transactions in which entities lend stocks and bonds in exchange for cash or other collateral. Mutual funds often lend securities to hedge funds to generate extra income, for example.  Some banks and asset managers such as BlackRock facilitate transactions for clients. They sometimes agree to compensate clients if a borrower fails to return a security that has become more valuable than the collateral held by the lender. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a group of regulators that keeps tabs on emerging risks, said in a report this month that these indemnification agreements could be risky for asset managers, which do not face the same capital and liquidity requirements as banks. BlackRock’s response, which was seen by Reuters, said its clients must hold more than enough collateral and that the firm has sufficient liquidity to meet indemnification needs. “Borrower default indemnification is an established practice in securities lending, provided by the majority of lending agents to a variety of their clients,” BlackRock said. Treasury Department spokeswoman Suzanne Elio declined to comment on the BlackRock paper. The Treasury Department houses the risk council. The risk council can tighten regulations on nonbank financial firms it views as especially risky, and asset managers want to avoid this. The council’s annual report, published in May, did not name any firms.

Barbara Novick, a BlackRock vice chairman, said in an interview that the report did not discuss asset managers’ efforts to ensure clients hold enough collateral. She also said the report overstated the risks because the agreements only kick in when a borrower defaults, and asset managers only pay the difference between the value of the security and the collateral.

605,BLK,"MOVES-Citigroup, HSBC Global Asset Management, Alvarez & Marsal","(Adds Citigroup) May 29 (Reuters) - The following financial services industry appointments were announced on Thursday. To inform us of other job changes, email to moves@thomsonreuters.com. The financial firm said it has named Richard Banziger as head of Citi Commercial Bank in the United States. A 30-year veteran of Citi’s institutional clients group, Banziger will lead the bank’s expanding middle-market banking business across the country. He replaces Will Howle, who was named head of Citi’s U.S. retail bank in April. The company hired a female partner from KPMG to head its audit operations as part of its drive to increase the number of senior female executives at the state-backed group. Mary Hall will be the second-most senior woman at the banking group when she takes up the role of group audit director in September, a spokeswoman for Lloyds said. LLoyds Bank Commercial Banking appointed David Bee as managing director and head of FX Sales & Wealth Solutions, based in London. Bee will take up the position in August. The asset management division of HSBC Holdings Plc  said Pedro Bastos would succeed Joanna Munro to become chief executive officer, Hong Kong, and regional head of Asia Pacific. Currently chief executive of HSBC Global Asset Management Brazil and regional head of Latin America, Bastos will relocate to Hong Kong to take up the new role. The UK-based professional services firm appointed Kleon Phili as a managing director to launch its European valuation services practice, based in London. Prior to joining A&M;, Phili served as executive vice president, global segment leader of financial advisory and executive committee member at Duff & Phelps, a valuation and corporate advisory firm. The investment manager appointed Mark Guirey as director of UK institutional business development, based in London. Most recently, Guirey was at BlackRock Inc, where he spent 13 years, latterly as a sales director within the UK institutional business. The investment consulting company appointed Amaya Assan as a senior investment research analyst, where she will focus on European, Asian, Emerging Markets and Japanese equity funds. Before joining Square Mile, Assan served as a senior investment research analyst for Morningstar OBSR, helping lead the firm’s coverage of long-only equity funds in the European, global emerging-markets, Asian and Japanese sectors. The unit of investment management firm Invesco Ltd  said Andrew Hall was promoted to fund manager on the Invesco Perpetual Global Opportunities Fund.

606,BLK,BlackRock's Fink jolts ETF business with 'blow up' warning,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink this week dropped a stink bomb on a small corner of the $2.5 trillion global market for exchange-traded funds. Fink, who runs the world’s largest asset manager and ETF provider, said structural problems with leveraged ETFs have the potential to “blow up the whole industry one day.” Sponsors of leveraged ETFs and related products, which make up only about $60 billion of global industry assets, called his remarks an exaggeration. Leveraged ETFs use derivatives and debt in an attempt to enhance returns - often by two or three times - that an investor would receive from putting money in stocks, bonds or other financial instruments. The only problem: if the underlying securities or indexes drop, the losses can be fast and heavy. Fink, who was speaking at a Deutsche Bank conference in New York, drew parallels between the embedded leverage in some ETFs and two obscure Bear Stearns hedge funds that collapsed in 2007. That ignited an initial wave of panic over Wall Street’s exposure to sketchy mortgages - a warning of much worse to come in the 2008 financial crisis.  A systemic risk could emerge from packaging inherently hard-to-trade securities, such as leveraged bank loans, into ETFs. The value of the ETF could collapse if the market for the underlying assets freezes up. That could touch off a rout within the ETF industry if skittish investors decide that many other funds are too dangerous for them.   Fink’s pointed remarks on Wednesday also raised questions about whether too many risky financial products are entering the marketplace.  In the aftermath of the financial crisis, a growing number of complicated and risky products are being aimed at Main Street investors. Hedge funds are making some of their strategies available to Mom and Pop investors willing to come up with as little as $1,000. Part of the pitch is that they need to look beyond plain vanilla investments if they want to have enough money to retire – the downside is that they could lose their shirts if markets take a sharp turn.  Last month, top money managers aired their concerns during a meeting with New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley.  The group, including hedge fund manager David Tepper of Appaloosa Management LP, worried aloud that investors may be stretching too far for returns in a low volatility, low interest rate environment, prompting “some market participants to take on additional leverage to meet investment targets,” according to recently released minutes from the April 10 meeting of the Fed’s Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets.  Fink on Wednesday suggested there’s systemic risk lurking in leveraged ETFs, in comments that resonated with some other investors.  “I agree with the notion that the leveraged ETFs have the potential to possibly be very upsetting to the market. It is the leverage that concerns me.” said Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles.  Fink said U.S. and European regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, don’t pay enough attention to individual financial products hitting the market.  The SEC in 2012 stopped giving new applicants permission to launch leveraged ETFs, because it was concerned about such funds. However, two fund sponsors – ProShares and Direxion – are still launching leveraged ETFs, using exemptive relief issued by the securities watchdog earlier. The SEC declined to comment on what Fink said. Fink, whose firm oversees $4.4 trillion in client assets, declined to comment for this story. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs owned 39 percent of the global ETF market with $953 billion in assets at the end of April. State Street Corp was a distant No. 2 with $409 billion in assets, followed by No. 3 Vanguard Group’s $368 billion. None of those three offer leveraged ETFs. Vanguard and State Street executives said they don’t share Fink’s view that the products pose a systemic risk. Dave Mazza, head of ETF research for State Street Global Advisors, said, “This is an extreme example of buyer beware.” He said it is possible a leveraged ETF meltdown could disrupt industry-wide compound annual growth rates that have topped 25 percent in recent years.  “These products work as advertised,” said Joel Dickson, Vanguard’s senior ETF strategist.  “Now, whether investors understand how they work is an education issue.”       Meanwhile, top leveraged ETF providers denounced Fink’s comments.  “Direxion Investments completely reject his contention that leveraged ETFs pose a systemic risk,” the company said in a statement. As of this week, the gross assets in 140 leveraged ETFs run by Direxion and rival ProShares totaled $22 billion. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares fund is one of the hottest leveraged ETFs on the market, attracting $1.07 billion in net flows from investors over the past 12 months, according to Lipper Inc, a unit of Thomson Reuters. A three times leveraged ETF like Direxion’s gold miners fund has $2 of leverage for every $1 of capital invested in the product. The ETF is rebalanced daily to maintain the same ratio of capital to exposure each day. This means, as Direxion explained, that leveraged ETFs respond to losses by reducing exposure. “It is hard to understand how Mr. Fink could conclude that a relatively small, highly liquid, completely transparent suite of products, which systematically reduce risk in response to losses, could generate systemic risk,” Direxion said. But Fink said this week that an inherently illiquid asset doesn’t become more liquid because it is wrapped inside a leveraged ETF fund.  “We will not do a bank loan ETF,” Fink said at the Deutsche Bank conference. “Why? We believe that the underlying asset is far less liquid than daily liquidity of an ETF. And you know as a banker, sometimes a bank loan market freezes.” ",5312014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-funds-etf-fink-analysis/blackrocks-fink-jolts-etf-business-with-blow-up-warning-idUSKBN0EB0HI20140531

609,BLK,BlackRock expands low-cost 'Core' series with 10 ETFs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the largest U.S. provider of exchange-traded funds, is expanding its lineup of low-cost ETFs with 10 equity and fixed-income funds that focus on areas such as dividend growth and value, and add exposures such as European and Pacific region stocks. The new additions, which include four new funds and six existing funds that BlackRock plans to cut prices on, build upon a program the company started in October 2012 to offer low-cost funds to investors as a way to compete with cheaper funds from competitors like Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab. Since the launch of the series, known as “iShares Core,” BlackRock said investors have added more than $25 billion in assets to the suite. “It’s really based on demand and what clients are looking for,” Patrick Dunne, head of global markets and investments for iShares, said in an interview. He said the funds so far have appealed to a range of buyers, from personal investors to institutions. “The new 10 are important for long-term investors looking for core strategies over time,” Dunne said. The company has dubbed this next slate of funds its “iShares Core Select” series group. It includes exposures to U.S. growth and value stocks, in addition to U.S. credit, mortgages and Treasury bonds, as well as European and Pacific equities. Those funds that are re-priced, and in some cases, re-named, will be modified effective Thursday. The company said it also expects to begin trading the four new funds on or around then. Among those funds BlackRock is slashing prices on, the biggest price cut will be its iSharesCore High Dividend ETF, which BlackRock is reducing to 0.12 percent, or $12 for every $10,000 invested, from 0.4 percent, or $40 for every $10,000 invested.

611,BLK,BlackRock says Credit Suisse guilty plea has no impact on relationship: paper,"ZURICH (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc. (BLK.N) said Credit Suisse’s CSGN.VX guilty plea in a U.S. tax evasion case does not affect its business relationship with the Swiss bank, the chief executive of the world’s biggest asset manager told a Swiss newspaper. Last month, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes.  Asked what consequences the guilty plea would have on BlackRock’s business relationship with Credit Suisse, Larry Fink told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft: “None at all, we’ll continue to do business with Credit Suisse.” The newspaper said BlackRock was Credit Suisse’s biggest counterparty, but a spokesman for the bank would not confirm this.

Fink said that it was up to BlackRock’s clients to decide how they wanted their money to be invested.  “If a customer asks us not to do business with a bank that has been found guilty, we have to respect that for that particular client,” he said.

613,BLK,"For U.S. retirement consultants, advisers disrupt the industry","New York (Reuters) - The big retirement benefit consultants are facing increasing competition as financial advisers move in on their turf, according to Chip Castille, the head of BlackRock’s  U.S. retirement group. For workers with 401(k) accounts the shift could translate into better investment choices, while for firms like Mercer and Aon Hewitt that have been big players in the $21 billion U.S. retirement business it’s a threat to their business. In the workplace 401(k) market, Castille said he is seeing more financial advisers with a “high level of expertise” focusing on retirement plan design. These advisers tend to manage small business plans that are $1 billion-$2 billion in size.  “You did not see that two years ago,” Castille said at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit. “It’s shocking and extremely disruptive.”  Scott David, head of U.S. investment services at T. Rowe Price, also speaking at the Reuters summit in New York, said that now “some of the most sophisticated benefits consulting comes from advisers at the biggest brokerages.” Both BlackRock and T. Rowe have built up sizable businesses serving the retirement workplace, competing with firms such as Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group. A seismic shift is happening across the wealth management industry, as more financial advisers move from commission-based businesses to ones that rely more heavily on fees. As advisers wade into the retirement world, more of them are taking on the role of fiduciary - which requires advisers to put their clients’ interests ahead of the financial firm that employs them.  Some of the biggest challenges for the retirement industry include the desire to create products that deliver fixed income to retirees; the push for lower fees; consolidation and increased regulation, Castile and David said. The impact of the baby boomers on the financial markets - as well as the overall retirement industry - is an emerging trend that both are watching carefully.  The notion that boomers will cash out of stocks upon retirement and hurt the overall equity market is false, David said. “If you are going to retire with a 30-year time horizon, why would you pull money out of the market?” he said.  Another myth: baby boomers will stop working upon retirement. “Boomers have transformed every phase of life through which they’ve passed,” noted Castille. A bigger concern for Castille is whether the 401(k) system will live up to its promise of securing retirement for boomers. “I worry that the 401(k) system is going to come under pressure,” Castille said. That’s because it was built as the baby boomers moved through the workforce. “It will receive more than its fair share of blame if boomers don’t get the outcome they want.” (In last paragraph, corrects quote to read, “It will receive more than its fair share of blame ... “, not “It will receive its fair share ...”) ",6162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wealth-summit-retirement/for-u-s-retirement-consultants-advisers-disrupt-the-industry-idUSKBN0ER2FR20140616

The lawsuits, filed in New York state court, claim the trustees breached their duties to investors by failing to force lenders and sponsors of the securities to repurchase defective loans, the suits claim. The investors are seeking damages for losses that exceed $250 billion and relate to over 2,200 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued between 2004 and 2008, according to a person familiar with the cases. The trustees that were sued include units of U.S. Bank (USB.N), Citibank (C.N), Deutsche Bank [DBKGN.UL], Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC.N), HSBC [HSBCUK.UL], and Bank of New York Mellon.

The lawsuits come after a New York appeals court ruling in December that determined the six-year statute of limitations to bring breach-of-contract cases against the issuers of mortgage securities began when the transactions were executed. The ruling means that for many cases it is too late to sue.  The lawsuits claim the trustees disregarded their duties to protect investors despite knowing that the trusts held a large number of loans that did not meet their contractual obligations.     The trustees were aware of an “industrywide abandonment of underwriting guidelines” for the loans and “pervasive and systemic deficiencies infecting the trusts’ collateral,” as the complaint against Citibank says.

618,BLK,BlackRock shifts pay formula for U.S. sales force,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc. BLK.N, the world’s biggest money manager, has made a radical shift in the way it pays its retail mutual fund salespeople in the United States, a top executive said. Rather than pay a percentage of the gross sales made through scores of brokerage firms, independent financial advisers, banks and insurance firms, BlackRock is using a “net” number that better reflects the profitability of the sale, Frank Porcelli, head of the fund company’s U.S. retail business, said at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit in New York this week. “I think we are ahead of almost every other firm in the industry in doing that,” said Porcelli, whose troops sold $7.5 billion of BlackRock mutual and exchange-traded funds in this year’s first quarter. “I think the industry has to move in this direction.” The compensation switch, made at the start of this year but previously unreported, addresses a hotly discussed issue among fund company executives. For years they have complained that salespeople were getting paid for fleeting revenue because certain sectors of investors hold funds for only a short period, robbing the companies of long-term asset management fees. For example, advisers at brokerage firms tend to be high-volume traders of funds shortly after clients grant them discretion to manage their portfolios, according to industry statistics. The fund companies also say it has become more expensive to sell through individual brokers and advisers, but they feared being the first to change the pay formula and losing salespeople to competitors. “There has been a lot of talk about whether there was a better way to do it, but gross payout remains the standard,” said Rick Ledbury, vice president of data services at the Money Management Institute, a trade group for fund companies. “BlackRock is a huge player in the space. People are obviously going to take notice.” In a poll of members in late March and early April, 96 percent of respondents said they used gross sales as their primary compensation driver. Almost half of those, however, said they used some “net” profit element in the calculation. Porcelli said “a substantial portion” of BlackRock compensation now takes into account how long funds are held and other elements that contribute to the company’s profitability. “To incent someone to get a dollar of business and have the buyer hold it for three weeks is not good business for anybody,” he said. “We want them to focus on people who are buy-and-hold investors, people who are using our products the right ways.” BlackRock pays its executives on net metrics, so putting salespeople under a similar formula is “a good alignment of interest from my perspective,” Porcelli said, adding that his sales teams have taken the change with relative calm. “We have a lot of credibility with them,” he said. “Our goal is to attract and train the best talent in the industry and pay them at those levels.” (For other news from the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit, click here)     ",6202014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wealth-summit-blackrock/blackrock-shifts-pay-formula-for-u-s-sales-force-idUSKBN0ET2J220140620
619,BLK,SEC weighs filing charges against BlackRock: filing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, one of the world’s largest asset managers, disclosed on Friday that it may face civil charges by a U.S. securities regulator over disclosures tied to a former portfolio manager whose personal investments suggested a possible conflict of interest. In a regulatory filing, BlackRock said its BlackRock Advisors LLC unit received a “Wells Notice” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A Wells notice is usually the last step in an SEC investigation before a civil enforcement action is filed, and gives a recipient one last chance to convince regulators not to file a lawsuit. BlackRock said it intends to cooperate with the SEC, and explain why no enforcement action is necessary. The investigation is tied to the personal investments of Daniel Rice, who left BlackRock in June 2012 over concerns about a potential conflict involving his family business and holdings in the firm’s energy mutual funds. The potential conflict stemmed from a joint venture with Alpha Natural Resources and a subsidiary of a natural gas drilling company founded by Rice.   In Friday’s filing, BlackRock said it had found no evidence of improper trading in Rice’s portfolios and that no clients had been harmed. It said the June 17 Wells notice suggests the SEC has concerns with BlackRock’s disclosures related to Rice, and with the company’s policies and procedures.   BlackRock said any civil enforcement action would likely allege possible violations of anti-fraud laws and rules governing compliance programs. “BlackRock put in place a number of additional specific measures in order to manage any potential conflicts of interest given Mr. Rice’s situation,” spokesman Brian Beades said. “BlackRock has further enhanced its compliance policies and procedures as our business and industry evolve and in keeping with best practice.” ",6272014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-blackrock-investigation/sec-weighs-filing-charges-against-blackrock-filing-idUSKBN0F22BH20140627

623,BLK,BlackRock ETFs near $1 trillion as it loses market share to Vanguard,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Even as BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is set to amass $1 trillion in exchange-traded fund assets in its iShares business, U.S. retail investors increasingly prefer to send their money to low-cost leader Vanguard Group, highlighting a weak spot for the world’s biggest money manager. With $998 billion in ETF money, BlackRock has more than the next contenders, Vanguard and State Street Corp (STT.N), combined. But the company has struggled to compete with Vanguard, known for its investor-friendly low-cost investing, for Mom and Pop’s nest eggs. Retail investors now account for more than half of the $1.8 trillion in ETF assets under management in the U.S, according to consulting firm PwC. So far this year, Vanguard has pulled in about $30.3 billion in net new ETF money in the U.S., or about 43 percent of the market, while iShares is second with $24.7 billion, or about 35 percent. That reflects a trend that’s been going on for years: at the end of 2009, BlackRock had 47.7 percent of total U.S. ETF assets under management, compared with 11.7 percent for Vanguard. By the end of May, BlackRock’s share was down to 38.9 percent, compared with 20.6 percent for Vanguard, according to Lipper Inc, a unit of Thomson Reuters. “Our aspiration is to be number one in flows, and we can’t get there without being higher in the retail market place,” said Mark Wiedman, the BlackRock executive who heads the iShares business globally, speaking at the company’s annual meeting in New York in June. “We are starting to change our voice for that audience and I would say historically we frankly haven’t done that good a job.” The market share loss comes in spite of BlackRock’s two-year effort to win retail investors. BlackRock introduced a line of low-cost “buy and hold” investor-aimed ETFs in 2012, and since then has been cutting prices on its ETFs, revamping its sales team, and pushing a new branding campaign. The firm has cut prices on 12 funds since 2012, ranging from its S&P; Total U.S. Stock Market ETF then to its high-dividend ETF in June 2014.  BlackRock says its flows have improved since it started its new retail effort.  One of the most significant price reductions was in its iShares High Dividend ETF. The cost to investors for that fund dropped to 0.12 percent a year from 0.4 percent, a move that would cost BlackRock $11.2 million annually, based on the $4 billion in the fund. Last quarter, iShares ETFs generated some $765 million in base fees revenue. “Every basis point that you cut a fee impacts revenues, but we don’t really look at that – we look at the profitability of our ETF business over the long term,” BlackRock executive Frank Porcelli, head of U.S. Wealth Advisory Business, said at Reuters’ Global Wealth Management Summit in June. Asked about how fee cuts would affect BlackRock’s profits, he said it was “not relevant.” With $4.4 trillion in total assets among its various product lines, BlackRock remains the world’s largest asset manager and is unlikely to be eclipsed by Vanguard anytime soon. BlackRock has nearly tripled the size of the iShares business since it bought it from Barclay’s five years ago, largely by selling to big institutions, such as the Arizona State Retirement System, which plunked down $300 million to seed three iShares funds last year. It has also won institutional and retail investors abroad; BlackRock has a strong presence in Europe, Asia, Canada and Latin America. Total BlackRock ETF assets outside of the U.S. are about $280.5 billion, about 36 percent of the $700 billion total market. Analysts say that iShares’ size and scale makes the effect of fee cuts in the near-term fairly minimal on the overall business, but that a prolonged price war could hurt the firm. “It’s a tough spot to be in,” said Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan. “There is some growth potential there, but it is slow to materialize and it has to be powerful enough to offset the addition of a lot of these products with fees less than the current weighted average fee rate.” Vanguard, which unlike BlackRock isn’t publicly traded, offers significantly cheaper funds. The average expense ratio of a Vanguard ETF is 0.14 percent, or $14 for every $10,000 invested, compared with the industry average of 0.58 percent. BlackRock’s average expense ratio is 0.32 percent. “When talking about large, commoditized ETFs, low cost makes a big difference, and Vanguard is a little bit more competitive,” said Gabelli & Co analyst Macrae Sykes. “Investors recognize Vanguard as the low-cost leader – whether for index funds, for active funds, for bond funds, for money market funds, or for ETFs,” said Vanguard spokesman David Hoffman. “We like to say that we’ve been lowering the cost and complexity of investing for 38 years. We are also increasingly being recognized for our commitment to providing high-quality products that can play an enduring role in a portfolio.” The iShares team has been working on building its brand. An “iShares by BlackRock” advertisement now shares the same spot on the New York Times home page as a Vanguard ad that bears its trademark ship. The two alternate in the advertising space next to the markets section. “Brand is important, and we recognize that,” BlackRock executive Raj Seshadri, head of U.S. Wealth Advisory iShares and former global chief marketing officer, said in an interview. To succeed better with retail investors, iShares will have to win over advisers such as Carl Amos Johnson, a fee-only adviser and owner of Grove Street Fiduciary in Peterborough, New Hampshire. He estimates that roughly 90 percent of the ETFs in his clients’ portfolios are Vanguard funds. “They (Vanguard) have captured the low-cost retail index mind, and even the most naive investor knows that,” Johnson said. “To me the brand is not the key, but in the mind of a client, it is a big difference.” ",6302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-ishares-etfs-analysis/blackrock-etfs-near-1-trillion-as-it-loses-market-share-to-vanguard-idUSKBN0F50BZ20140630

629,BLK,BlackRock's second-quarter profit rises 11 percent,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest money manager, reported an 11 percent jump in second-quarter profit on Wednesday, boosted by strong markets that helped drive flows into its funds across asset classes and regions. The New York-based asset manager posted net income of $808 million, or $4.72 per share, up from $729 million, or $4.19 per share, a year earlier. “A key thing for BlackRock is that we are the largest player,” Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview, noting that the asset manager’s global presence and local footprint in 30 different countries has enabled it to grow by winning assets from smaller players in many domestic markets. “In Europe, we’re seeing domestic mutual fund players losing market share to the international players,” he said. “Some of the domestic managers may have superb asset management in their domestic market, but they don’t have, in many cases, the global presence in products across the board.” BlackRock ended the quarter with $4.6 trillion in assets under management, up 19 percent from a year ago.  BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded funds business, which crossed $1 trillion in assets for the first time in June, drove the bulk of the asset manager’s long-term net flows during the quarter. Of the $38 billion that investors poured into long-term funds during the quarter, 80 percent was into iShares funds.  BlackRock executives said they have benefited from investors utilizing ETFs in place of other financial instruments, replacing futures or single bond strategies with more liquid and cheaper ETFs to gain exposure. “That is something that many of the other issuers of ETFs really don’t think about,” BlackRock President Rob Kapito said on a call with analysts. “We are treating (ETFs) as a significant financial instrument, not just a product that we’re hoping to garner more assets in.” BlackRock said it had positive net flows across asset classes during the quarter, and fixed-income products led gains with $21.3 billion in long-term flows. Investors added $9.7 billion in net flows into its equity funds, $6.8 billion into multi-asset products, and $267 million into alternatives. The company’s annualized organic growth during the quarter was 4 percent, and Fink stood by his target to generate 5 percent annual growth in assets under management.     “I’d rather see Larry set aggressive targets just so that there’s drive behind their business model,” said Gabelli & Co analyst Macrae Sykes. Revenue at BlackRock grew 12 percent to $2.8 billion, with revenue generated by performance fees paid by investors growing 29 percent to $115 million from a year earlier. Excluding a net non-cash tax expense and other one-time items, earnings were $4.89 a share, beating analysts’ average forecast of $4.46 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The 15-count indictment, handed down by a federal grand jury in San Francisco, includes charges for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances.  In a statement, FedEx Senior Vice President Patrick Fitzgerald said the company is innocent and will plead not guilty. “FedEx transports more than 10 million packages a day,” Fitzgerald said. “The privacy of our customers is essential to the core of our business. This privacy is now at risk.” Beginning in 2004, FedEx was warned “on no less than six different occasions” that illegal Internet pharmacies were using its services to distribute prescription drugs, the indictment said. Those warnings extended to senior management at the company, the filing said. In one instance, FedEx knew the Drug Enforcement Administration shut down one pharmacy, but continued to ship packages from its affiliates. FedEx’s Fitzgerald said U.S. prosecutors are asking that the company assume responsibility for the legality of millions of packages a day.  “We are a transportation company. We are not law enforcement,” he said.

636,BLK,Blackrock sees riskier outlook for major emerging markets,"LONDON (Reuters) - Political instability and a worsening economic outlook mean major emerging markets such as Argentina, Brazil and Russia are riskier places to invest, according to a closely watched index. According to asset manager Blackrock’s (BLK.N) quarterly Sovereign Risk Index, the three months to the end of June favored developed markets such as Belgium and Britain, which rose in the rankings, while key emerging markets fell. Brazil dropped four places to 31st out of 50 countries, attributed by Blackrock to rising levels of short-term debt. Russia fell three places to 24th, on “a decline in its perceived government effectiveness” and worsening economic prospects. Argentina, locked in a row with investors refusing to accept write downs of sovereign debt arranged as part of a restructuring, fell one spot to 45th from the previous quarter. The index is made up of a mix of quantitative measures, such as debt to gross domestic product (GDP) and tax revenues, alongside qualitative assessments like the perceived effectiveness and stability of governments. Investors and economists have become increasingly concerned about political instability in many emerging markets following flare-ups of civil unrest in a lengthening list of countries such as Brazil, Thailand, Egypt and Turkey.  Blackrock set up the index in 2011, after the credit crunch and against the backdrop of a debt crisis in the euro zone that centered on Greece, seeking to provide investors a more in-depth measure of how risky sovereign debt was. But while some emerging markets slipped in the rankings, a number of developed economies’ rankings in the index benefited from the International Monetary Fund raising growth forecasts.

639,BLK,Broad commodity ETPs attract strong inflows in July: BlackRock,"LONDON (Reuters) - Diversified commodity exchange-traded products (ETPs) attracted strong inflows in July as a pick-up in economic growth in China and the United States encouraged investors to return to the unloved asset class. Investors injected $936 million into broad-basket commodity ETPs last month – the biggest inflow for this segment in three years, data from asset manager BlackRock showed.  That compared with the high watermark for the category in February 2011 of $1.5 billion in inflows, according to Ursula Marchioni, head of ETP Research EMEA at BlackRock’s iShares. Industrial metals ETPs also attracted a robust $117 million as the tide began to turn for the more cyclical commodities. ETPs, whose value is linked to moves in their underlying assets, offer an easy route into commodities for investors and allow asset allocators to make quick, tactical changes to their portfolios.  Investors withdrew $42.9 billion from commodities ETPs in 2013, preferring to join the equity rally, but improving economic data in 2014 has tempted some to return. “Sentiment across commodities was deeply negative last year, but people now feel it has been beaten up way too much,” said Nitesh Shah, associate director at ETF Securities, an issuer of ETPs.  “Prices are looking somewhat attractive now, the U.S. economy is showing good growth, and investors are looking for very broad exposure. Sentiment has turned around decisively.” The S&P; GSCI commodity index was down 5.9 percent in July, but this was mainly due to falls of 5.8 percent in energy and 8.7 percent in agriculture. Industrial metals were up 2.7 percent due to low inventories and strong Chinese demand, according to S&P; Dow Jones Indices.  Marchioni also pointed to China’s HSBC flash PMI reading for July, which suggested factory activity was expanding at its fastest pace in 18 months.   “During August some of the cyclical commodities should continue to benefit from better numbers from both China and the U.S.,” Shah said, noting that U.S. second-quarter GDP had rebounded from the first quarter, when a prolonged spell of extremely cold weather paralyzed parts of the country. Gold ETPs also posted a rebound with some $630 million of inflows, although they were still down $182 million on the year. In terms of price performance, gold was down 3.4 percent for the month.  Marchioni said that most of the gold inflows were in U.S.-listed products and might have been related to expectations that inflation will rise given the pick-up in economic activity. Agriculture ETPs showed outflows of $74 million on prospects for high yields of wheat, corn and soybeans and weak prices. “All of those have seen near perfect growing conditions,” Shah said.  “After last year’s drought, a lot of farmers allocated more land to these key crops, especially in the U.S., and now supply is looking extremely flush, so price performance has been negative.” S&P; Dow Jones Indices said that corn was the worst performing commodity in the S&P; GSCI in July, down 14.7 percent. At the end of July, BlackRock’s data covered 911 commodity ETPs worldwide, worth some $125 billion.

642,BLK,UPDATE 1-Top Canada finance ministry official Boivin to join BlackRock,"(Adds details, quotes, background; in U.S. dollars) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Top Canadian finance ministry official Jean Boivin will join the London office of BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, the firm said on Monday. Boivin, seen as a contender to head the Bank of Canada one day, is the second most powerful official at the ministry. Reuters broke the news last week that he would be leaving his post on Aug. 29. Boivin will start work as deputy chief investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute on Sept. 15, the firm said in a statement. Boivin also serves as Canada’s representative at the Group of Seven, the Group of 20, and the G20’s Financial Stability Board, which monitors the global financial system. “His vast knowledge of the global financial and economic landscape and deep policymaking experience are invaluable assets,” said Lee Kempler, the BlackRock institute’s executive director. The institute provides the firm’s portfolio managers with insights on sovereign risk and the macro investment outlook. “I’m excited to be able to bring my experience and ideas to BlackRock as it executes on its mission of delivering exceptional investment performance and deep capital market insights to its clients,” Boivin said in the statement. Boivin was not immediately available for comment. BlackRock reported an 11 percent jump in second-quarter profit last month, boosted by strong markets that helped drive flows into its funds across asset classes and regions. The firm, which has $4.6 trillion in assets under management, has a history of employing former government and central bank officials. Vice Chairman Ken Wilson served as an adviser to the U.S. Department of Treasury during the height of the financial crisis. In May of this year the firm hired White House economic adviser Sarah Bianchi. Former Swiss central bank chairman Philipp Hildebrand joined the firm’s London office in 2012. Among those who have worked for the London-based institute are Peter Fisher, a former senior official at the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

647,BLK,BlackRock launches multi-manager alternatives fund for retail investors,"NEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, which has been heavily promoting alternative investments to retail investors, intensified that effort on Tuesday with the launch of a new multi-manager fund. The BlackRock Multi-Manager Alternative Strategies Fund combines the strategies of seven different managers into one fund. It is the seventh of so-called alternative mutual funds that BlackRock has launched aimed at penetrating the retail alternatives market, an area that executives at the New York-based asset manager say they want to dominate. Alternatives, which BlackRock defines as investments other than long-only stocks and bonds, and cash, typically command higher fees. They are already a big revenue driver at BlackRock, which manages nearly $4.6 trillion in assets as the world’s largest money manager. Alternatives generated about 9.1 percent of the firm’s total revenue last quarter, while accounting for just 2.6 percent of total assets under management. The new fund will be a pricey addition, with an annual management fee of 1.95 percent. Annual fund operating expenses, after fee waivers and reimbursements, could be as much as 3.64 percent for some investors who buy the fund through brokers. Cash flows into retail alternatives, including mutual funds, are projected to produce as much as 50 percent of the net new revenues that U.S. asset managers will make from retail customers over the next five years, according to an Aug. 6 report from McKinsey & Co. “It’s certainly a big opportunity for them,” said KBW analyst Robert Lee, noting that BlackRock has already “invested a lot in beefing up” their retail business and alternative capabilities. The fund is designed to seek total return and, like other alternatives, diversify investor portfolios beyond core stock and bond holdings. It includes alternative investment strategies from seven different managers, or sub-advisers, whose focuses range from fundamental long/short to event driven strategies. Among the fund’s sub-advisers is LibreMax Capital, whose manager Greg Lippmann told Reuters last year they have been “very active” in consumer asset-backed securities, particularly student loans but also credit card debt. BlackRock already sells hedge funds, private equity, infrastructure and real estate investments - all termed alternatives - to institutional investors. Packaging offerings like that into mutual funds that Mom and Pop investors can buy is a logical extension of the firm’s strategy. “It fits very well with our footprint as a firm,” said Matt Botein, chief investment officer and co-head of BlackRock’s alternatives business, in an interview. The firm has been promoting alternatives to financial advisers through sales meetings, white papers and more. BlackRock is not alone in its push with retail alternative funds, which generally tuck sophisticated hedge-fund type strategies into mutual funds anyone can buy. There have been 40 new alternative funds launched this year, by research firm Morningstar’s tally, and $14.6 billion in net inflows into the category, which now boasts a total $156.3 billion in assets.

655,BLK,UPDATE 1-Stock market hopefuls face harder sell as investors weary of IPO flood,"* Firms line up for the next wave of IPOs * But investors weary of ploughing through lots of names * Concerns also mounting that prices to date too high * Bankers predict fund managers will demand better deals   (Updates to clarify Gruppo Coin’s subsidiary OVS to be floated in paragraph 11) By Freya Berry LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - European stock market listings are kicking off again after a summer break, but many companies hoping to copy successful flotations earlier in the year now have to convince investors weary from a flood of new names and burned by high prices. Enthusiasm for initial public offerings (IPOs) has quadrupled the amount raised in Europe in the first nine months of this year compared to a year earlier to a total of $55.5 billion. But the sheer number of deals is starting to put fund managers off and prompt fears among bankers that some of their IPO clients will get lost in the noise, with investors simply not able to schedule time to listen to them all. Alastair Gunn at Jupiter Asset Management is already suffering from the deluge. “I’m starting to get a regular stream of stuff coming through the mail,” Gunn, co-manager of Jupiter’s distribution and high income funds, told Reuters. “When we invest in anything we want to do the legwork, meet the management, understand the business model. But the kind of sausage factory environment we’ve been in is not very conducive to doing your homework.” Craig Coben, co-head of Global Equity Capital Markets (ECM) at BoA Merrill Lynch sees the problem too. “With so many IPOs in the pipeline, there is a risk of market indigestion, with the weaker companies and more marginal names finding a less receptive hearing,” said Coben. “One of the practical challenges will be to carve out the time in investors’ diaries and ensure they can devote the necessary time to analyse and model all of these IPOs.” In particular, companies set up with private equity are keen to capitalise on current strong valuations to return money to their founders. Private equity-backed IPOs have accounted for one-fifth of the total so far this year, the highest proportion since at least 1994, according to Thomson Reuters data, with Carlyle’s UK car services firm RAC, BC Partners’ Italian retail chain Gruppo Coin’s subsidiary OVS and Lone Star’s German property business TLG among those being lined up to float in the coming months. But their emphasis on securing high prices at listing is starting to put off the new investors they need to woo. Some investors complain that advisers’ strategy of targeting short-term U.S. hedge funds prepared to pay top dollar has in particular forced up the valuation of companies - especially those with a smaller international presence which underperform in the markets once shorter-term funds have moved on. UK retailer Poundland and Swedish cable operator Com Hem are just some that are now trading below their issue price, making fund managers worry about getting burned by similar patterns in future deals. “When so many deals start going to discount it’s a signal to the investment bankers that they got it wrong. And I do think they have got it wrong,” said Gunn. In an August email to bankers, investment firm BlackRock complained to bankers about newly-floated companies missing their first public results forecasts and the stock plummeting subsequently. The email named firms including online travel agency eDreams and Spanish testing business Applus . “The street should have been more prudent in its forecasts. Some investors have been saying, ‘I wish you guys had priced these things a bit better for us,’” said one equity capital markets banker who declined to be named because of the sensitivity around pricing. Paradoxically the same calm market conditions that are encouraging so many IPOs are also making them difficult to support as fund managers struggle to make returns. Low volatility may boost listing prices, but it also makes it hard for fund managers to justify buying into new companies when it’s hard enough to make gains on tried-and-tested ones. Even short-term investors have struggled. Hedge funds betting on rises and falls in the equity capital markets have made returns of just 0.8 percent in 2014 so far, according to the Eurekahedge Europe Long Short Equities Index, against a rise of 6.4 percent in the FTSEurofirst 300 Index. With this in mind, advisers predict that investors will become more selective as they try to improve their returns in what’s left of the year - and that they will be looking for more competitive pricing from stock market-bound companies. “A lot of the hedge funds have been working their butts off and they’re sitting there with gains of less than 2 percent,” the banker said. “I think investors are going to be very demanding, because they need to be.”     (Additional reporting by Nishant Kumar; Graphics by Vincent Flasseur; Editing by Sophie Walker and Eric Walsh)",9072014,http://www.reuters.com/article/ipo-europe/update-1-stock-market-hopefuls-face-harder-sell-as-investors-weary-of-ipo-flood-idUSL5N0R814020140907

658,BLK,UPDATE 3-Negative yield threat prompts BlackRock to act on money market fund,"* To distribute income daily instead of monthly * Investors in ICS Euro Government Liquidity Fund informed * Follows weak money market trading after ECB depo rate cut   (Add detail in paragraph 7) By Simon Jessop and Emelia Sithole-Matarise LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Global fund manager BlackRock  said on Friday that it had told investors in one of its money market funds it would rebalance the fund daily in response to the threat of negative yields. Returns from money market funds in Europe have been hit by  weakening in trading conditions after the European Central Bank cut its deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent. Discouraging economic data and geopolitical risk made things worse. That has left many investors worrying over whether they will get a return or lose money on a range of money market instruments, and if so how much, as the ECB action is felt in prices across the market. “Negative is the new normal, and clients need to think about what that means for their cash management,” said Bea Rodriguez, the head of cash portfolio management for Europe at BlackRock. “Most people haven’t had to think about cash,” she said. “It’s often the last thing they think about in their portfolio. But right now there is a cost to holding cash.” Some funds have closed to new money since the ECB first moved to a zero deposit rate in July 2012. BlackRock is the latest firm to look to tweak its rulebook in order to keep a fund open. Others, with more focus on credit, have yet to feel the pinch. It will do this by distributing income from the ICS Euro Government Liquidity Fund daily instead of monthly and, if the investments have returned a negative yield, cancel as many units in the fund as necessary to ensure the value of the remaining units remains steady. “In the case of net negative portfolio yields, due to all securities that the fund can invest in trading negatively, maintaining a stable net asset value (NAV) would be impossible without having appropriate mechanisms in place or undergoing structural changes,” BlackRock said in a statement. Investors would still lose money in that situation, but they should lose less than they would by parking their cash at the bank, using alternatives such as the commercial paper or repo market or by leaving it with a custodian. All of those incur costs. “Investors still value money market funds as a cash- management tool, and we want to make sure our clients can continue to access our funds during these challenging times,” Rodriguez said. Investors in the ICS Euro Government Liquidity Fund voted in 2013 to put a so-called Reverse Distribution Mechanism in place to allow the fund to continue to operate in a negative interest rate environment. On Wednesday, BlackRock wrote to them to give 14 days notice of its intention to trigger the mechanism, although it stressed this did not imply the yield of the fund would turn negative as a result. BlackRock currently manages around $268 billion equivalent in money market funds and cash portfolios around the globe, of which it has 23 billion euros ($29.77 billion)in three euro-denominated funds and roughly 35 billion pounds ($56.81 billion) in two sterling-denominated funds. At the end of 2012, total assets under management held in money market funds in Europe was around 1 trillion euros, the Institutional Money Market Funds Association said on its website. The U.S. market was around $2.6 trillion. When the ECB cut its deposit rate to zero in 2012, BlackRock and other big money market fund providers like JPMorgan  and Goldman Sachs temporarily restricted access to some of their funds to protect shareholders from yield dilution. After the latest ECB measures, JPMorgan Asset Management said in a statement it did not expect its money market fund to turn negative in the near term. “All of our euro money funds remained “open for business as normal. We will continue to monitor market conditions closely.”  ($1 = 0.7725 Euros) ($1 = 0.6161 British Pounds)   (Editing by Clare Hutchison, Larry King)",9122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-funds/update-3-negative-yield-threat-prompts-blackrock-to-act-on-money-market-fund-idUSL5N0RD1TP20140912

Returns from money market funds in Europe have been hit by a weakening in trading conditions as the European Central Bank has cut its deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent, some economic data in the region has worsened and as geopolitical risk has increased. The move, called a Reverse Distribution Mechanism, allows the firm to rebalance the net asset value of a fund so that it remains stable even though yields elsewhere may be negative. BlackRock said it sent a letter to investors in the ICS Euro Government Liquidity Fund on Wednesday to give 14 days notice of its intention to switch on the mechanism, although it stressed this did not imply the yield of the fund would turn negative. “This is a situation that all Euro money market fund providers face as they work with institutional clients with cash management requirements within the new normal of negative yields,” BlackRock said in a statement. “In the case of net negative portfolio yields, due to all securities that the fund can invest in trading negatively, maintaining a stable net asset value (NAV) would be impossible without having appropriate mechanisms in place or undergoing structural changes.”   (Reporting by Simon Jessop.

663,BLK,BlackRock calls for U.S. stock market reforms,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, has asked regulators to force exchanges to lower their access fees and require greater transparency of broker dealer-run trading venues known as “dark pools.”  The New York-based company outlined a set of proposals aimed at boosting public confidence in the equity markets in a letter on its website to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated Sept. 12. It said that while the market is “not broken or in need of large scale change,” improving current rules would help promote fairness, order and efficiency. Questions about the safety and fairness of the mostly electronic markets have risen in recent years following a raft of high-profile trading glitches by numerous market participants, causing hundreds of millions of dollars of losses. Those concerns hit the mainstream in late March with author Michael Lewis’ book “Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,” which claimed the markets were rigged in favor of high-speed traders.      BlackRock, which has $4.6 trillion in assets under management, said conflicts of interest in the markets could be reduced simply by lowering exchange fees charged to brokers that buy shares. Exchanges fees are currently capped at 30 cents per 100 shares taken from the exchange. Many exchanges also give rebates of a similar amount to brokers that sell shares on the exchange.  Reducing the fees to five or 10 cents per 100 shares, which would also lead to lower rebates, would prevent brokers from routing to particular venues based on how much they might get charged or make off of rebates, reinforcing best execution principles, BlackRock said.  It added that more orders might end up going to public exchanges instead of private dark pools, which have lower fees and have benefited from cost-cutting brokers.  Some people, such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher, have called for an end to the rebate system, but BlackRock said such incentives can have a positive impact by compensating brokers for adding liquidity to the markets. The asset manager also stopped short of calling for a rule that would force more trading on exchanges at the expense of dark pools and other venues that do not have to show pre-trade order information. Nearly 40 percent of stock trading  volume happens away from exchanges, raising concerns about price discovery. But BlackRock said these venues help keep costs low and allow institutional investors to covertly sell big blocks of stock without the market moving against them. It did, however, call for heightened disclosure by broker-dealers on how they route orders and on the quality of the order executions. Further, it said dark pool operators should be required to make the details of how their platforms work public.

666,BLK,U.S. SEC imposes $9 million in sanctions for short-sale violations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nineteen trading firms and one trader will pay $9 million to collectively settle civil charges alleging they participated in a stock offering after shorting the stock during a restricted period, U.S. regulators said Tuesday. The Securities and Exchange Commission said the settlements mark the latest actions in an effort to crack down on hedge funds and private equity funds that violate a securities rule designed to prevent potential manipulation. Among the charged firms settling the case are BlackRock’s BlackRock Institutional Trust Company and New York-based Advent Capital Management. A spokesman for BlackRock said Tuesday that the SEC’s case stems from three “inadvertent” violations dating to 2010 and 2011. “There was no allegation that BlackRock intentionally violated the rule,” the spokesman said. “Client accounts will not be affected and the company has further enhanced its compliance policies and procedures since 2011.” Advent Capital did not have an immediate comment on the SEC’s case. The rule at the heart of the SEC’s sweep is called Rule 105 of Regulation M. Rule 105 prohibits a trader from shorting stock prior to a public offering and then subsequently buying that same stock through the offering. The SEC does not need to show a firm or individual intentionally violated the rule in order to bring a case. Last year, the SEC brought similar cases against 23 firms and earlier this year it obtained a record sanction for a Rule 105 violation against a New York proprietary trading shop and its owner. The SEC’s decision to focus on this area may reflect the “broken windows” enforcement philosophy that SEC Chair Mary Jo White announced last year. That idea, which comes from the approach that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani applied to his crackdown on crime in the city, calls for making sure small violations are addressed in an effort to deter more serious ones.

667,BLK,"Blackrock, investment funds wary of revival in Brazil IPOs","SAO PAULO (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc and other investment firms are not so sure that a revival of initial public offerings in Brazil will fly. Speculation that President Dilma Rousseff could lose an October election to a more market-friendly challenger has boosted Brazilian stocks and reignited interest in an IPO market that has been dormant this year. The Bovespa stock index .BVSP has rallied as much as 11 percent since Aug. 14. Three companies, JBS Foods SA, T4U Holding Brasil SA and Ouro Fino Saúde Animal Participações SA, will take advantage of improving market sentiment and try to price their initial offerings next month. The IPOs are set to happen between the first and second rounds of Brazil’s most unpredictable presidential election in 12 years. Regardless of how polling on the race swings, bankers involved in the deals told Reuters there is no turning back. Yet pension funds and asset management firms remain wary. Apart from election-related risks, concerns over reduced global liquidity and an economic recession extending into next year could discourage them from snapping up shares of companies with little track record or earnings visibility. “I don’t see why anyone would get into an IPO now in Brazil, the environment is not a good one,” said William Landers, who oversees $4 billion in Latin American equities for BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager. “Companies have to face the reality of higher risk premiums.” Fabio Moser, who manages 5.9 billion reais ($2.52 billion) for Fator Administração de Recursos, said companies seeking to debut in the local stock market face a delicate balancing act: how to offer attractive risk and return as economic and political uncertainty escalates. Bankers say companies could be forced to lower their asking prices as investors gain the upper hand to press for bigger-than-usual discounts. They remain confident that funds will keep a watchful eye on new Brazil issues because the local equity market is more liquid and more diverse than those in other emerging markets. “Buyers will play hardball and shun IPOs with unrealistic valuations,” Moser said in an interview. “Convincing the market to buy isn’t impossible, but it certainly won’t be easy.” JBS Foods, a unit of meatpacker JBS SA (JBSS3.SA), aims to fetch 4 billion reais from its IPO. Banks working on the deal want to kick off meetings with investors as soon as possible, a source with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters. Cell tower operator T4U and veterinary product maker Ouro Fino operate in sectors promising investors protection in the event of a downturn.   “Taking advantage opportunistically of a rally is a little risky for these companies in a moment that is not the best to buy IPOs,” said Julian Mayo, a co-chief investment officer overseeing $3 billion in emerging market equities for Charlemagne Capital in London. Still, two bankers involved in the deals said some investors are expressing preliminary interest in all three IPOs.  The bankers, who requested anonymity since the deals are in the works, said they believe the IPO price tags may have to be adjusted if a volatile market begins to hamper the IPOs’ investment cases. Both bankers said they believe the IPOs are in sectors that look immune to the impact of the election. “My view is that there is always demand for good investment cases at the right price, regardless of the macroeconomic picture or the political moment,” said Marcelo Mesquita, who oversees 550 million reais for Leblon Equities Gestão de Recursos in Rio de Janeiro. Seen for most of the last decade as a symbol of Brazil’s buoyant capital markets, IPOs have languished in the past three years as prices sank for many names that went public. While most markets have gradually recovered from the global financial crisis of 2008, IPOs remain out of favor. Stung by a string of deals in recent years that failed to deliver the promised returns, investors have turned especially cautious with Brazilian IPOs. About one-third of the almost 120 IPOs priced in São Paulo since 2005 yielded returns above the benchmark CDI interbank lending rate, with the rest losing half the amount invested, Credit Suisse Group AG said last year. That is sidelining foreign investors, traditionally the largest buyers of offerings in the country. Foreigners snapped up 70 percent of Brazilian share offerings between 2006 and 2008, but that share fell to a decade-low average of 41 percent last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Local investors including Eduardo Roche of Canepa Asset Management are in the same boat. Brazilian IPOs still rely heavily on foreign investors as resident investors alone are not numerous or big enough to subscribe most of an offering.  The last time a Brazilian company listed shares on the São Paulo Stock Exchange was December 2013, when travel agency CVC Brasil Operadora de Turismo SA (CVCB3.SA) raised 540 million reais from investors. This year, IPOs in Brazil are likely to have their worst year in at least a decade.

670,BLK,"BlackRock, Goldman unconstrained bond funds double in assets","(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and BlackRock Inc have seen their unconstrained bond funds double in size over the past 12 months as investors continue to search for yield in this low interest rate environment. Unlike traditional bond funds, where managers have to stick to a mandate, unconstrained bond fund managers can invest across the fixed income market. They are often called “go anywhere” bond funds. Historically investors have been wary of such funds because they were not sure where they fit in carefully designed portfolios, said Barry Fennell, an analyst with Lipper, a division of Thomson Reuters. However, with interest rates so low, investors have increasingly been willing to “push the envelope,” he said. It is no longer just retail investors moving into these funds to avoid interest rate risk, said Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income.  “We are seeing pension funds and state funds grow significantly in this space to take advantage of this flexibility,” Rieder told Reuters in an interview at BlackRock’s offices on Wednesday.      Over the past 12 months, investors have poured more than $17 billion into Goldman’s Strategic Income Fund, the  biggest U.S. unconstrained bond fund at $25.8 billion in assets, according to Morningstar. The fund has returned 3 percent over the past year. The Barclays Aggregate Bond Index has returned 5.66 percent for the past year, according to Lipper. BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, the second biggest fund of this kind at more than $20 billion, has seen $11 billion in inflows over the past 12 months. The fund has returned over 6 percent over the last year. These funds tend to be more expensive than traditional bond funds. According to Lipper the average fees for unconstrained bond funds is 1.29 percent, compared to 0.83 percent for core bond funds. Both BlackRock and Goldman may have benefited from a general outflow at Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), the Newport Beach, California, firm that has seen fallout from a leadership shakeup and mediocre returns.  Over the past 12 months, investors have pulled a net $8 billion from the $21.6 billion Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund, one of the firm’s most important offerings.

673,BLK,"Goldman Sachs files for active ETFs, joins Wall Street bank trend","NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc  has laid the groundwork to launch actively managed exchange-traded funds, becoming the latest Wall Street bank to set its sights on the fast-growing market. The company late on Friday sought permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to introduce what could be a series of active ETFs, according to the filing, which names an equity dividend ETF as its initial fund. Goldman separately filed late on Friday for regulatory approval to self-index, which would allow Goldman to launch funds based on their own proprietary indexes created in-house. “They’re kind of covering all of their bases,” giving the firm broad leeway to design and introduce a variety of ETF products, said Ben Johnson, a Chicago-based analyst with Morningstar. Goldman in July shifted a key executive to help grow its ETF product strategy, but otherwise has been largely quiet on its plans to expand into the ETF space. The company five years ago filed for permission to launch passive index-tracking ETFs, but never introduced any funds. Friday’s filing was the first to mark its foray into the active ETF space. Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Raphael confirmed the filings, but declined to comment on them more specifically. “We are excited” about the July decision to name 19-year industry veteran Michael Crinieri to lead the ETF effort, she said. The initial fund named in the filing, the Goldman Sachs Equity Dividend Fund will primarily invest in dividend-paying U.S.-listed equities, according to the filing. The Goldman filings come as some of Wall Street’s biggest banks have begun wading into the exchange-traded funds market. JPMorgan Chase & Co in June launched its first ETF and already plans to bring more funds to market, while Wells Fargo & Co received regulatory permission in August to offer ETFs. The move is seen by some as a defensive play by banks with their own wealth management clients. The banks can use their own ETFs to hold onto assets of customers showing some willingness to abandon traditional mutual funds and move into the $1.9 trillion U.S. ETF market, which has more than doubled in the past five years. “You’re increasingly seeing that cannibalization is less of a concern than the outright loss of those assets,” Johnson said, pointing to one of the concerns of mutual fund providers that has kept some from offering their strategies in ETF form. Unlike the biggest ETF providers - BlackRock Inc, State Street Corp and Vanguard, who together account for about 70 percent of the market - banks are putting more emphasis on their existing active investing capabilities. The asset management businesses of Goldman, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are already among the largest in the country, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper.

676,BLK,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Stock market hopefuls face harder sell as investors weary of IPO flood,"(Corrects SEPT 7 story to delete reference to Poundland shares trading below issue price, in paragraph 14) * Firms line up for the next wave of IPOs * But investors weary of ploughing through lots of names * Concerns also mounting that prices to date too high * Bankers predict fund managers will demand better deals By Freya Berry LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - European stock market listings are kicking off again after a summer break, but many companies hoping to copy successful flotations earlier in the year now have to convince investors weary from a flood of new names and burned by high prices. Enthusiasm for initial public offerings (IPOs) has quadrupled the amount raised in Europe in the first nine months of this year compared to a year earlier to a total of $55.5 billion. But the sheer number of deals is starting to put fund managers off and prompt fears among bankers that some of their IPO clients will get lost in the noise, with investors simply not able to schedule time to listen to them all. Alastair Gunn at Jupiter Asset Management is already suffering from the deluge. “I’m starting to get a regular stream of stuff coming through the mail,” Gunn, co-manager of Jupiter’s distribution and high income funds, told Reuters. “When we invest in anything we want to do the legwork, meet the management, understand the business model. But the kind of sausage factory environment we’ve been in is not very conducive to doing your homework.” Craig Coben, co-head of Global Equity Capital Markets (ECM) at BoA Merrill Lynch sees the problem too. “With so many IPOs in the pipeline, there is a risk of market indigestion, with the weaker companies and more marginal names finding a less receptive hearing,” said Coben. “One of the practical challenges will be to carve out the time in investors’ diaries and ensure they can devote the necessary time to analyse and model all of these IPOs.” In particular, companies set up with private equity are keen to capitalise on current strong valuations to return money to their founders. Private equity-backed IPOs have accounted for one-fifth of the total so far this year, the highest proportion since at least 1994, according to Thomson Reuters data, with Carlyle’s UK car services firm RAC, BC Partners’ Italian retail chain Gruppo Coin’s subsidiary OVS and Lone Star’s German property business TLG among those being lined up to float in the coming months. But their emphasis on securing high prices at listing is starting to put off the new investors they need to woo. Some investors complain that advisers’ strategy of targeting short-term U.S. hedge funds prepared to pay top dollar has in particular forced up the valuation of companies - especially those with a smaller international presence which underperform in the markets once shorter-term funds have moved on. Stocks such as Swedish cable operator Com Hem are now trading below their issue price, making fund managers worry about getting burned by similar patterns in future deals. “When so many deals start going to discount it’s a signal to the investment bankers that they got it wrong. And I do think they have got it wrong,” said Gunn. In an August email to bankers, investment firm BlackRock complained to bankers about newly-floated companies missing their first public results forecasts and the stock plummeting subsequently. The email named firms including online travel agency eDreams and Spanish testing business Applus . “The street should have been more prudent in its forecasts. Some investors have been saying, ‘I wish you guys had priced these things a bit better for us,’” said one equity capital markets banker who declined to be named because of the sensitivity around pricing. Paradoxically the same calm market conditions that are encouraging so many IPOs are also making them difficult to support as fund managers struggle to make returns. Low volatility may boost listing prices, but it also makes it hard for fund managers to justify buying into new companies when it’s hard enough to make gains on tried-and-tested ones. Even short-term investors have struggled. Hedge funds betting on rises and falls in the equity capital markets have made returns of just 0.8 percent in 2014 so far, according to the Eurekahedge Europe Long Short Equities Index, against a rise of 6.4 percent in the FTSEurofirst 300 Index. With this in mind, advisers predict that investors will become more selective as they try to improve their returns in what’s left of the year - and that they will be looking for more competitive pricing from stock market-bound companies. “A lot of the hedge funds have been working their butts off and they’re sitting there with gains of less than 2 percent,” the banker said. “I think investors are going to be very demanding, because they need to be.”     (Additional reporting by Nishant Kumar; Graphics by Vincent Flasseur; Editing by Sophie Walker and Eric Walsh)",9252014,http://www.reuters.com/article/ipo-europe/corrected-update-1-stock-market-hopefuls-face-harder-sell-as-investors-weary-of-ipo-flood-idUSL5N0R814020140925

678,BLK,"Vanguard, BlackRock may reap billions from Pimco after Gross exit","NEW YORK/BOSTON - Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc could be prime destinations for hundreds of billions of dollars in assets that may flee Pimco in the wake of the sudden exit of Bill Gross, the celebrated “Bond King” of U.S. mutual funds. His new company, Janus Capital Group Inc, may see Gross’s cachet attract tens of billions of dollars, investors and analysts said. During the year ended Aug. 31, investors made $64.7 billion in net withdrawals from Pimco funds, according to research firm Morningstar Inc. Those outflows will likely accelerate with Gross’s departure. “Lots of Pimco AUM (assets under management) will be up for grabs,” analysts at Wells Fargo Securities said, noting that they reckoned the total sum Gross managed at Pimco ranged from $500 billion to $700 billion. If half of that amount turns over - typical when a high profile manager leaves a fund - Gross’ departure could translate into a $300 billion market opportunity for rivals, Wells Fargo analyst Christopher Harris said Monday in a research note. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, and Vanguard, the No. 1 U.S. mutual fund company, provide the performance and the size to attract cash flows from investors unnerved by the infighting at Pimco during the past several months and amid a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Smaller fund companies may also benefit from the fallout. Retail investors tend to shift money quicker than big pensions and other investment institutions, which deliberate more slowly about what to do.  Janus, the Denver asset manager with a volatile history, could be in for a surprise if it is expecting Pimco money to flow automatically after the star fund manager.     “Gross is a very capable investment manager. He’s not God,” said Carl Nelson, executive secretary and chief investment officer of the $1.1 billion San Luis Obispo County Pension Trust.       Instead, institutional investors such as Nelson, who can take months to make decisions, will want to see how Gross settles into his new role managing the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, which has about $13 million under management. To be sure, more than a dozen fund representative and consultants told Reuters that they have hesitations about leaving Pimco, which Gross co-founded more than 40 years ago. “We hired Pimco as an organization, we didn’t hire Bill Gross as an individual to manage our money,” said Stephen Rauh, the chairman of the $4 billion Vermont Pension Investment Committee, which has Pimco on its “watch list.” Pimco’s Total Return Fund, which Gross ran personally for 27 years and has about $222 billion in assets, appears most vulnerable to poaching, said analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group.  “BLK (BlackRock) is likely the biggest beneficiary,” analyst Doug Sipkin said.  Meanwhile, few fund firms have had a harder time than Janus over the past decade as its stock funds fell out of favor. Janus has struggled for years to recapture the status it lost during the dot-com crash. Its assets peaked at more than $300 billion in 2000 and stood at $178 billion at the end of June. Janus CEO Dick Weil hopes Gross will attract money to a stable of bond funds that have just $31.4 billion in assets under management as of June 30. That’s up from $9.2 billion four years ago.  Janus now could double or triple those bond assets again as money follows Gross, said Dan Sondhelm, partner at SunStar Strategic, a financial services consulting company in Alexandria, Virginia. “No salesman could do that,” Sondhelm said. Investor cash flows could start to gather steam by the first quarter of next year, he said.  For Gross, the shift to Janus means giving up one of the industry’s biggest paychecks, a reported $200 million a year, if for no other reason than the fund he will manage is a fraction of Total Return Fund’s size. Gross has a net worth of $2.3 billion, according to Forbes. “He didn’t come for big money upfront, he came to build a fund” and other products, said a person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Janus likely has put together a pay plan that would reward Gross for drawing assets into products he oversees, a key measure of success in the fund industry, said Todd Sirras, managing director at pay consulting firm Semler Brossy, which has worked with Janus in the past. Gross, 70, wasn’t available to comment. A Janus spokesman said executives including Weil wouldn’t comment. “Janus’s move to hire Mr. Gross strikes us as precipitous, coming two days after last week’s multiple news reports about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of alleged improper valuation and performance reporting in Pimco’s $3.6 billion Total Return exchange-traded fund,” Moody’s said. “If the SEC determines that these allegations are true, it would not be clear what liabilities – both legal and reputational – might attach to Mr. Gross.” ",9302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pimco-allianz-janus-analysis/vanguard-blackrock-may-reap-billions-from-pimco-after-gross-exit-idUSKCN0HP0D720140930
679,BLK,"UPDATE 1-BlackRock bond head says speculators on ECB QE making ""mistake""","(Adds context, Pimco statement) By John Geddie LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Investors loading up on some of the euro zone’s riskiest government bonds on expectations that the European Central Bank will buy them are making a mistake, BlackRock’s head of European and global bonds said on Wednesday. Market expectations that the ECB will be forced to resort to sovereign bond-buying as part of a broad-based quantitative easing (QE) scheme have shot up in recent months as the bloc tips towards deflation. “The market is very much taking for granted that quantitative easing through a government bond purchase programme is coming and I think there are many, many obstacles to that still to come,” Scott Thiel, who oversees assets worth around $100 billion for BlackRock, told Reuters. “If people are buying Spanish and Italian bonds because they think the ECB is going to buy them from them, I think that is a mistake.” Many bank analysts predict a full-blown QE programme in the next six months, while some see it as early as November, as the ECB’s efforts to ensure the recovery appear to be falling short. Economists polled by Reuters saw a 40 percent probability of the ECB purchasing sovereign bonds, up from 25 percent at the start of the month. Pimco, the world’s biggest bond investor, remains overweight on Italian government debt, its European strategist said on Wednesday, quelling market fears that the departure of Chief Investment Officer Bill Gross could mark a change in direction. At the start of the year, Pimco, which manages $2 trillion (1.58 trillion euros) worth of assets globally, said its position in high-yielding government bonds of the euro zone periphery, such as Italy’s and Spain’s, was the largest ever. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, said in May that one of its main bond funds - which Thiel oversees - had cut its holdings of peripheral euro zone government debt to their lowest since the height of the crisis.

The sale, announced on Monday, will allow Link Net’s biggest investors to cash in on a surge that has seen the network provider’s stock price quadruple since a mid-May initial public offering as more and more Indonesian households go online. Link Net expects sales to grow 20 percent in 2014 as it adds up to 250,000 new homes. CVC, First Media and two other minority shareholders are offering 1.22 billion of shares in Link Net in an indicative range of 6,200-6,700 rupiah apiece, according to a term sheet of the deal seen by Reuters. The deal received commitments worth $257 million from nine cornerstone investors including fund manager BlackRock Inc. , hedge fund firm Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC  and Goldman Sachs Investment Strategies, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter who couldn’t be named because details of the deal aren’t public. Malaysian investment firm CMY Capital and U.S. fund managers Neuberger Berman and William Blair & Co. were also among the cornerstone investors, the source added. At the upper end of the range, the sale would be worth 8.15 trillion rupiah ($668 million). The deal would be the biggest in Indonesia since CVC and other shareholders sold a $1.48 billion stake in PT Matahari Department Store Tbk in March 2013. Shares of Link Net were down 0.4 percent in early afternoon trading in Jakarta, giving the company a $1.8 billion market capitalisation. The benchmark Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index was down 0.6 percent. First Media said in a securities filing it will sell 334.69 million shares, equivalent to an 11 percent stake in Link Net. CVC is selling 629.8 million shares through Asia Link Dewa Pte Ltd, according to the term sheet. As of June, First Media, the media arm of Indonesian conglomerate Lippo Group, held 41 percent of Link Net.

688,BLK,U.S. yields seen rising after bond rally: BlackRock's Rieder,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Benchmark U.S. Treasuries yields should drift higher into year-end after a bond market rally on Wednesday that briefly pushed the 10-year government note yield below 2 percent for the first time in 16 months, according to a top bond officer at BlackRock Inc. Safe-haven buying of U.S. government debt has surged since last week on fears about the global economy. Weak U.S. data on Wednesday fed those fears. “Technical market factors, not fundamentals, were at play here” during the bond market rally, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income, Rick Rieder, said in a statement on Wednesday, blaming the bond market rally on large players unwinding bets on rising Treasuries yields in the futures markets. “The extremity of the move suggests that it is highly unlikely to have been caused by a wholesale reevaluation of fundamental economic conditions, despite some weaker data releases this morning,” he said. New York-based BlackRock, which oversees $4.3 trillion, is the world’s largest asset manager. Rieder manages the $21.9 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund and $3.6 billion BlackRock Total Return Bond Fund. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell as low as 1.865 percent in early U.S. trading before ending the day at 2.129 percent, down 8 basis points from late Tuesday. Rieder said fair value of 10-year Treasuries is roughly between 2.65 percent to 2.75 percent, a trading range not seen since April. For the remainder of the year, the 10-year yield will likely “drift higher again, but their cap is probably lower for now,” he said, in the 2.50 percent to 2.60 percent area. In the intermediate term, the 10-year yield would approach 3 percent, he said. Given the sharp drop in 10-year Treasuries yield, he characterized the high-yield, or junk bond, market as “more attractive” than earlier this year as its relative risk premiums versus Treasuries have increased. He noted the junk bonds on average are yielding 6.5 percent more than 10-year Treasuries, compared with a yield spread of 5.0 percent. The default rate for junk bonds “should still remain muted for the time being,” Rieder said.    As of Sept. 30, the BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund and the BlackRock Total Return Bond Fund held 4.2 percent and 3.7 percent of their assets in high-yield debt, respectively, data on the company’s website showed.

691,BLK,BlackRock profit jumps 26 percent in third quarter,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest money manager, said on Wednesday that third-quarter earnings rose 26 percent, boosted by an improved performance of its fixed income funds.     Net income increased to $917 million, or $5.37 per share, from $730 million, or $4.21 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax benefit, earnings were $5.21 a share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of $4.69, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. BlackRock ended the quarter with $4.5 trillion in assets under management, up 10 percent from a year earlier, while net inflows rose almost 4 percent to $28.7 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters that BlackRock had been winning business throughout the year, particularly in its fixed income funds.  “We have raised $48 billion year to date in fixed income net flows,” Fink said. Flows into those funds have accelerated over the past few weeks, Fink said, largely due to their improved performance rather than solely from clients leaving rival Pacific Investment Management Co after the Sept. 26 departure of its star manager, Bill Gross. Fink would not say how much money has flowed into BlackRock funds since the announcement that Gross was leaving Pimco for Janus Capital Group Inc JNS.N. The firm sees an opportunity in the tens of billions of dollars in the fixed income space over the next several quarters, Fink told analysts on a call. BlackRock’s taxable fixed income funds have outperformed their benchmarks over the past one-, three- and five-year periods. Their outperformance comes after BlackRock spent the past six years rebuilding its fixed income business, Fink said.  BlackRock’s third-quarter inflows were almost evenly split between stock and bond funds, with $10.2 billion going into the equity side and $11.1 billion into fixed income. Multi-asset funds had $7.4 billion in inflows.  About $18.2 billion, more than 60 percent of inflows, went into BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded fund business.   Institutional investors added $5.5 billion to BlackRock’s funds, and the company’s retail funds had $5 billion in inflows.  BlackRock’s alternative funds had $80 million in outflows in the third quarter. Fink said $7 billion had been committed to them but was not yet invested.  Analysts agree that BlackRock is well-positioned as clients move their money away from Pimco, which Keefe, Bruyette & Woods described in an Oct. 8 report as “the Bill Gross effect.”  Clients may move money to firms like BlackRock for actively managed fixed income funds, but they also may decide that passively managed funds are safer, according to the report. In the first few weeks of October, BlackRock had more than  $7 billion of net new flows into fixed income iShares ETFs. BlackRock shares were down 1 percent at $303.78 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The company has seen an uptick in investors’ moving money into its fixed income funds over the past few weeks and expects that to continue into the fourth quarter and beyond, he said. BlackRock has been one of the beneficiaries as investors pulled money out of Pacific Investment Management Co after Bill Gross announced on Sept. 26 that he had quit the fixed-income fund company to join Janus Capital Group Inc, Fink said. Fink told CNBC that he did not believe bond markets had been roiled by Gross’ exit. He also said BlackRock had not seen more than one sovereign wealth fund sell out of equities in last six weeks despite the global market volatility. Overall, Fink said he would like to see the U.S. Federal Reserve take action and raise interest rates to between 1 percent and 1.25 percent, which he believes would be good for the U.S. economy. New York-based BlackRock reported a 10 percent increase in assets under management and a 26 percent increase in earnings from the third quarter of last year.

698,BLK,"UPDATE 1-U.S. SEC plans to deny proposals for ""non-transparent"" ETFs","(Adds comments from lawyer, details on proposals) By Ashley Lau NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators said they plan to deny proposals for a new breed of actively managed exchange-traded funds that want to keep their holdings secret for months at a time. It would be the latest setback for a rule change that many in the industry see as a game changer for the ETF market. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late on Tuesday issued a notice on two of the proposals, from Precidian Investments and BlackRock Inc, noting for each that it “preliminarily intends to deny the application.” The proposals seek permission to create actively managed ETFs that would not be required to disclose their holdings on a daily basis. Currently, all active ETFs are required to disclose their holdings on a daily basis. These funds often gain a reputation based on a manager’s winning investment philosophy, and daily transparency could allow others to “front-run” the active manager. Firms say these so-called “non-transparent” ETFs will allow them to use sophisticated investment strategies without revealing the fund manager’s moves. At the heart of the SEC’s issue with the proposals is a concern over the ability of market makers to be able to effectively arbitrage the proposed non-transparent ETFs with the lack of disclosure provided. That could result in wide bid-ask spreads and cause the funds’ intraday market prices to significantly deviate from their net asset values. Such a condition “may be exacerbated during times of market stress,” the SEC noted. “Absent a request for a hearing that is granted by the Commission, the Commission intends to issue an order under the Act denying the application,” the notice said. The Precidian and BlackRock filings are two among a handful of proposals for non-transparent active ETFs currently before the SEC. But the potential denial of the proposals could be a setback for the others still awaiting a decision, said Jane Kanter, a former partner at Dechert LLP, who now runs compliance for New York-based ETF shop Ark Investment Management. “I think it’s going to have a dampening effect on the other proposals,” she said. Other firms that are also seeking SEC permission include Eaton Vance Corp, State Street Corp, Invesco Ltd’s PowerShares and most recently, Fidelity Investments. Still, it is a positive that the SEC did not flat out deny the proposals, but instead published its reasons for wanting to deny the order and give the applicants an opportunity to request a hearing, said John McGuire, a partner at Bingham McCutchen LLP and co-chair of the firm’s global investment management practice group. “I think that people will be able to use this information to go back and tweak their own filings to try and address some of the issues,” McGuire said.

699,BLK,"UPDATE 1-As ETF M&A; heats up, industry wonders who is next","(Adds analyst comment about SEC notice in 11th paragraph.) By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - When it comes to expanding in the $1.9 trillion U.S. exchange-traded fund market, which some forecasts say will pass the traditional mutual fund industry in size within 10 years, some companies have concluded it’s better to buy than to build. ETFs are baskets of securities, like mutual funds, but trade on exchanges, like individual securities. They are cheaper than mutual funds and allow investors to trade throughout the day, with simultaneous pricing, unlike mutual funds, which price at the end of the day. They are also profitable: In the third quarter, BlackRock Inc, the biggest provider of the funds, made $850 million in fees from its iShares ETFs, 30 percent of the $2.8 billion in revenue it reported. Facing shrinking margins from their traditional businesses, asset managers are under pressure to offer ETFs. Last week, Janus Capital Group announced the acquisition of exchange-traded fund provider VelocityShares and Reuters exclusively reported last week that Goldman Sachs in talks to buy IndexIQ, another ETF firm [ID: nL2N0SB2NV]. Now, industry executives wonder who will be next. “If you are chief executive of a traditional asset management firm, you are asking yourself, ‘What is my strategy for ETFs?’” said Michael Spellacy, a partner at New York-based Broadhaven Capital Partners. Given how crowded the U.S. ETF market has become, it’s easier to spend a few hundred million dollars to buy an existing firm that already has a management team, relationships with advisers who will sell the funds and regulatory approvals for existing funds than to try to come up with a new and unique product in hopes of gaining assets, executives said. The price Janus paid for VelocityShares hasn’t been disclosed. Matt Hougan and Dave Nadig of ETF.com made the estimate that ETFs would surpass the $11.6 trillion U.S. mutual fund industry within 10 years. T. Rowe Price and Capital Research & Management are among a number of fund companies that do not yet have ETFs but have sought approval from regulators to launch so-called non-transparent actively-managed ETFs that don’t require daily disclosures of holdings. On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a notice stating that it intends to deny two applications for non-transparent active ETFs but similar proposals for active nontransparent ETFs may still get approval in the next several months, according to some industry observers. That would put competitive pressure on fund companies like American Century Investments and Putnam Investments, which have not made any movement to get into the ETF space, to act quickly by acquiring small ETF funds that already have regulatory approvals to introduce active ETFs. And if the SEC prohibits firms from launching nontransparent active ETFs, it means that asset managers will have one less opportunity to get into this space. “That in and of itself could lead to more firms buying ETF providers,” said Matt Hougan, president of ETF.com. Just because firms like T. Rowe have applied for regulatory approval to launch active ETFs, doesn’t mean they might not ultimately acquire a smaller ETF firm to come out with something faster, according to Nadig at ETF.com. Janus filed to launch active ETFs a few years ago and is still awaiting approval, he said. American Century and T. Rowe declined to comment. Putnam did not return calls. A Capital Research spokesman said the firm has no plans to acquire an ETF firm. One driver of future acquisitions is the growing popularity of actively managed ETFs, experts said. While actively managed ETFs only make up 0.1 percent of the U.S. ETF market, some predict that they will gain traction as investors get used to the idea and certain products have success. “The consensus wisdom today is that active ETFs are actually going to make money in the next three years and they are going to be a central part of the strategic toolkit for money managers,” said Donald Putnam, managing partner at Grail Partners LLC, a private equity firm that sold its own actively managed ETF business to Ameriprise Financial in 2011. One target on many firms’ wish list is New York-based WisdomTree Investments, the fifth largest ETF provider. It has a market cap of $1.4 billion and already has regulatory approval to do active ETFs. ProShares, the eighth largest ETF provider in the U.S. with $26 billion in assets under management, also could be an attractive acquisition because it not only offers active ETFs, but it has alternative investments ETFs, which have been popular with brokers and financial advisers as a way to protect clients from market volatility, experts said. Both VelocityShares and IndexIQ have alternative ETFs, noted Ben Johnson, an ETF analyst at Morningstar. A WisdomTree spokesman declined to comment on speculation and said the firm remains focused on growing its business. ProShares declined to comment. Experts and bankers expect smaller firms like Global X Funds and United States Commodity Funds to get bought in coming years as they have good niche products and both need distribution. New York-based Global X has 38 ETFs, including a number of portfolios that invest internationally. Its most successful product is its $1 billion Global X SuperDividend ETF.  Oakland, California-based U.S. Commodity Funds has a series of ETFs that invest in different commodities, including oil and natural gas. John Hyland, chief investment officer of U.S. Commodity Funds, said the firm was not for sale. Global X declined to comment. The growth in the ETF industry also means that there are opportunities for acquisitions in businesses beyond pure ETF providers. For example, many private equity firms are looking to acquire companies that manage portfolios of ETFs. Charles Schwab Corp put ETF model portfolios on the map for in 2010 when it acquired Windward Investment Management, now called Windhaven Investments. Chicago-based Good Harbor Financial, a model ETF portfolio provider that private equity firm FTV Capital bought in 2013, would be an attractive acquisition, bankers said. FTV declined to comment. Yet another acquisition strategy being considered as a way to benefit from the increasing amounts of money flowing into ETFs is buying the indexes themselves. The London Stock Exchange in June announced a $2.7 billion takeover of U.S. index compiler and asset management firm Frank Russell. McGraw Hill Financial Inc’s S&P; Dow Jones Indices and financial information services providers Markit Ltd are finalists in bidding to acquire Barclays Plc’s index business. Niche index provider Alerian, which offers a number of indices including the Alerian Master Limited Partnership Index and has $21 billion tracking its indices, could be a potential target in coming months. Alerian is not actively running a sales process but would be open to a sale at the right price and on the right terms, said Kenny Feng, the firm’s president and CEO.

701,BLK,"RPT - DEALTALK-As ETF M&A; heats up, industry wonders who is next","(Repeats for additional subscribers. For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double-click on DEALTALK) By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - When it comes to expanding in the $1.9 trillion exchange-traded fund market, which some forecasts say will pass the traditional mutual fund industry in size within 10 years, some companies have concluded it’s better to buy than to build. ETFs are baskets of securities, like mutual funds, but trade on exchanges, like individual securities. They are cheaper than mutual funds and allow investors to trade throughout the day, with simultaneous pricing, unlike mutual funds, which price at the end of the day. They are also profitable: In the third quarter, BlackRock Inc, the biggest provider of the funds, made $850 million in fees from its iShares ETFs, 30 percent of the $2.8 billion in revenue it reported. Facing shrinking margins from their traditional businesses, asset managers are under pressure to offer ETFs. Last week, Janus Capital Group announced the acquisition of exchange-traded fund provider VelocityShares and Reuters exclusively reported last week that Goldman Sachs in talks to buy IndexIQ, another ETF firm [ID: nL2N0SB2NV]. Now, industry executives wonder who will be next. “If you are chief executive of a traditional asset management firm, you are asking yourself, ‘What is my strategy for ETFs?’” said Michael Spellacy, a partner at New York-based Broadhaven Capital Partners. Given how crowded the U.S. ETF market has become, it’s easier to spend a few hundred million dollars to buy an existing firm that already has a management team, relationships with advisers who will sell the funds and regulatory approvals for existing funds than to try to come up with a new and unique product in hopes of gaining assets, executives said. The price Janus paid for VelocityShares hasn’t been disclosed. Matt Hougan and Dave Nadig of ETF.com made the estimate that ETFs would surpass the $11.6 trillion U.S. mutual fund industry within 10 years. T. Rowe Price and Capital Research & Management are among a number of fund companies that do not yet have ETFs but have sought approval from regulators to launch so-called non-transparent actively-managed ETFs that don’t require daily disclosures of holdings. Now, they are expected to get those regulatory approvals in the next several months, according to some industry observers. That would put competitive pressure on fund companies like American Century Investments and Putnam Investments, which have not made any movement to get into the ETF space, to act quickly by acquiring small ETF funds that already have regulatory approvals to introduce active ETFs. Just because firms like T. Rowe have applied for regulatory approval to launch active ETFs, doesn’t mean they might not ultimately acquire a smaller ETF firm to come out with something faster, according to Nadig at ETF.com. Janus filed to launch active ETFs a few years ago and is still awaiting approval, he said. American Century and T. Rowe declined to comment. Putnam did not return calls. A Capital Research spokesman said the firm has no plans to acquire an ETF firm. One driver of future acquisitions is the growing popularity of actively managed ETFs, experts said. While actively managed ETFs only make up 0.1 percent of the U.S. ETF market, some predict that they will gain traction as investors get used to the idea and certain products have success. “The consensus wisdom today is that active ETFs are actually going to make money in the next three years and they are going to be a central part of the strategic toolkit for money managers,” said Donald Putnam, managing partner at Grail Partners LLC, a private equity firm that sold its own actively managed ETF business to Ameriprise Financial in 2011. One target on many firms’ wish list is New York-based WisdomTree Investments, the fifth largest ETF provider. It has a market cap of $1.4 billion and already has regulatory approval to do active ETFs. ProShares, the eighth largest ETF provider in the U.S. with $26 billion in assets under management, also could be an attractive acquisition because it not only offers active ETFs, but it has alternative investments ETFs, which have been popular with brokers and financial advisers as a way to protect clients from market volatility, experts said. Both VelocityShares and IndexIQ have alternative ETFs, noted Ben Johnson, an ETF analyst at Morningstar. A WisdomTree spokesman declined to comment on speculation and said the firm remains focused on growing its business. ProShares declined to comment. Experts and bankers expect smaller firms like Global X Funds and United States Commodity Funds to get bought in coming years as they have good niche products and both need distribution. New York-based Global X has 38 ETFs, including a number of portfolios that invest internationally. Its most successful product is its $1 billion Global X SuperDividend ETF.  Oakland, California-based U.S. Commodity Funds has a series of ETFs that invest in different commodities, including oil and natural gas. John Hyland, chief investment officer of U.S. Commodity Funds, said the firm was not for sale. Global X declined to comment. The growth in the ETF industry also means that there are opportunities for acquisitions in businesses beyond pure ETF providers. For example, many private equity firms are looking to acquire companies that manage portfolios of ETFs. Charles Schwab Corp put ETF model portfolios on the map for in 2010 when it acquired Windward Investment Management, now called Windhaven Investments. Chicago-based Good Harbor Financial, a model ETF portfolio provider that private equity firm FTV Capital bought in 2013, would be an attractive acquisition, bankers said. FTV declined to comment. Yet another acquisition strategy being considered as a way to benefit from the increasing amounts of money flowing into ETFs is buying the indexes themselves.

704,BLK,U.S. SEC rejects NYSE proposal to list 'non-transparent' ETFs,"NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Friday rejected a proposal from the NYSE Arca exchange to be able to list and trade actively managed exchange-traded funds that do not have to disclose their holdings on a daily basis. The move follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s announcement earlier this week that it intends to deny proposals from Precidian Investments and BlackRock Inc  to be allowed to create such ETFs.  Because the NYSE filing is linked to the Precidian funds, the rejection of the exchange’s proposed rule change was largely expected. Regulators must grant both permission to the fund managers to create such funds, as well as approve the exchange’s proposed rule change to list such funds, in order for the new breed of ETFs, often referred to as “non-transparent” ETFs, to be able to launch. While those decisions are made by separate divisions within the SEC, with the Division of Trading and Markets ruling on the exchange’s filing, and the Division of Investment Management deciding whether to grant permission to fund managers, the two processes are often said to be in tandem. “After careful consideration, the Commission does not find that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,” the SEC said in the 34-page order posted Friday. NYSE declined to comment on the SEC’s decision. Both the NASDAQ Stock Market and BATS Global Markets exchanges also have proposals in front of the SEC to be able to list and trade non-transparent ETFs. Those filings, which are still awaiting a decision, are tied to funds from different firms that are also seeking permission to launch such ETFs. Speaking on a panel on Thursday about ETF trading at the Metropolitan Club in New York, NYSE executive Laura Morrison told the room that the push for non-transparent active ETFs lives on, despite the SEC’s decision around the Precidian and BlackRock filings. “That doesn’t mean that the initiative stops,” said Morrison, head of global index and exchange-traded products at NYSE Euronext, while moderating the panel at the Capital Link Dissect ETFs Forum. “The Exchange strongly believes that, while we’re disappointed, we’re still going to fight the good fight for the innovation in the industry,” she said.

705,BLK,"BlackRock cuts fees on bond funds, following other money managers","(Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N) on Monday became the latest asset manager to lower fees on some of its bond funds in recent weeks.  BlackRock’s fee cut, which follows similar changes by Lord Abbett and OppenheimerFunds, comes after the high-profile departure of Bill Gross from Pacific Investment Management Co in late September and could help the firm capture some of the outflows that are pouring out of Pimco, analysts said. New York-based BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is lowering the fees on three of its bond funds, including its $4 billion Total Return Fund (MAHQX.O), according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. “BlackRock regularly evaluates fund fees and expenses to ensure that they remain competitive as the marketplace evolves,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. The drops in fees by Lord Abbett and OppenheimerFunds earlier this month were also disclosed in regulatory filings. Gross resigned from Pimco on Sept. 26 to join rival Janus Capital Group JNS.N, and investors pulled $25.5 billion from Pimco’s U.S. open end funds in September, according to Morningstar data. Given how low bond yields are today, even small fee cuts can catch the attention of potential clients, said Dan Culloton, an analyst at Morningstar.  The fees on institutional shares of the BlackRock Total Return Fund will drop to 45 basis points, from 52 basis points, putting it in line with Pimco’s Total Return fund, which charges 46 basis points for institutional shares. Fees for A-shares of the BlackRock Total Return Fund will drop to 79 basis points from 83 basis points. BlackRock also is lowering fees on institutional shares for the BlackRock Core Bond Fund (BCBAX.O) to 45 basis points, down from 56 basis points. B-shares of the BlackRock Low Duration Bond Fund (BFMSX.O) will now cost 154 basis points down from 162 basis points, according to the filing. Lord Abbett made a similar fee cut to its Lord Abbett Total Return Fund (LTRAX.O) on Oct. 14. Fees on A-shares of that fund are now 68 basis points, down from 85, while fees on institutional shares dropped to 48 basis points, from 65. On Oct. 20, OppenheimerFunds cut the fees of its Core Bond Fund, with fees on A-shares now 85 basis points, down from 91. Spokespeople for each firm said the changes were made as part of an ongoing evaluation of fees. Institutional shares of the BlackRock Total Return Fund have outperformed peers, including the Pimco Total Return Fund, for the past one, three and five years, ranking among the top decile of its category, according to Morningstar.  Given how well the $4 billion BlackRock Total Return Fund has performed, it will likely win over many investors, including advisers, 401(k) plans and pension plans, considering moving away from Pimco, said Jeff Tjornehoj, head of research at Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company.  “This is a shot across the bow at Pimco,” Tjornehoj said.

707,BLK,"UPDATE 3-Japan's SoftBank kicks off $10 bln India online spree, buys stake in Snapdeal","* Invests $627 mln in India’s 3rd-biggest e-commerce firm * Snapdeal ‘potential to be India’s Alibaba’ -Softbank’s Son * Funds needed to tackle rivals in India online retail boom * SoftBank also leads investment in Olacabs taxi app   (Adds Snapdeal CEO comment in 10th and 11th paragraphs) By Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Indulal PM MUMBAI, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Japanese telecom and media group SoftBank Corp has set its sights on Indian e-commerce in its aggressive expansion drive, saying it will invest about $10 billion in the booming sector as it took a strategic stake in one of its rising stars. Masayoshi Son, chief executive of SoftBank, laid out a 10-year investment plan for India on Tuesday, starting with the purchase of a $627 million stake in fast-growing online marketplace Snapdeal. Son’s global ambitions flared into public view last year when SoftBank bought No. 3 U.S. mobile carrier Sprint Corp for $21.6 billion. The Snapdeal purchase comes as international investors hunt deals in online retail in India, which has the world’s third-largest Internet user base but where e-commerce is still relatively underdeveloped. For cash-rich SoftBank, owner of a third of newly listed Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, the move is the latest in a series of deals designed to counter sluggish growth at home. “I have a strong willingness to invest more like $10 billion in the next 10 years,” Son said in an interview on Indian CNBC after his company announced plans to buy in Snapdeal, which connects small businesses with customers in an online marketplace. “I strongly believe that Snapdeal has the potential to be like the Alibaba of India.” In a separate deal announced on Tuesday, SoftBank said it will lead a $210 million investment round with existing investors in ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which owns a mobile application for taxi bookings that competes with the likes of Uber. SoftBank didn’t disclose how big a stake it will have in Snapdeal, which will use funds to expand operations to compete with bigger, free-spending rivals Flipkart.com and Amazon.com . The company did say it will become the biggest investor in Snapdeal, where sales of everything from clothes to computers have brought in around 25 million registered users and 50,000-plus merchants, attracting international shareholders like e-commerce operator eBay Inc and investment firm BlackRock Inc. One person with knowledge of the deal told Reuters SoftBank will own about 30 percent of New Delhi-based Snapdeal, buying new shares in the firm, valuing all of Snapdeal at around $2 billion. Snapdeal declined to comment on the terms of the deal. “SoftBank is a major investor in the internet space and them putting in a large sum of money validates the growth of Indian e-commerce,” said Niren Shah, managing director at venture capital firm Norwest Venture Partners. Kunal Bahl, co-founder and chief executive of Snapdeal, said the two sides were quick to negotiate a deal, taking just three weeks. “Most of the capital investment we’re going to make is in technology,” he said in an interview, signalling about $250 million will be spent next year. Bahl said the company plans to open a Bangalore innovation centre in two weeks, and Snapdeal was planning to hire about 500 engineers. Pressure had been growing on Snapdeal to raise funds to compete as online retail surges in India, with local industry leader Flipkart raising $1 billion in July, and global e-commerce giant Amazon.com pledging to invest a further $2 billion in its India unit. The SoftBank investment is in line with the $600 million-$650 million sources told Reuters Snapdeal had been seeking, and is the biggest investment by a single investor in the e-commerce sector in India. With this round of investment, Snapdeal, co-founded by Bahl and Rohit Bansal four years ago, has raised about $1 billion this calendar year. The company said it plans to use the money to ramp up technology and supply chain management systems, and add order fulfilment centres to 30 cities. The company currently has 40 fulfilment centres in 15 cities. Snapdeal will also look at making three or four bolt-on acquisitions in the coming few months specifically in the area of mobile technology and set up an incubation centre to work with start-up businesses in the mobile technology space, the company said. CEO Bahl, who has said he also wants Snapdeal.com to become “the Alibaba of India”, told Reuters in September that the company was focusing on improving its technology platform so that it could connect more small-scale enterprises with buyers. Snapdeal plans to expand its merchant base to 1 million in the next three years. Both deals were negotiated under newly appointed SoftBank Vice chairman Nikesh Arora, reflecting the company’s recent aggressive overseas expansion. “India has the third-largest internet user base in the world, but a relatively small online market currently.

708,BLK,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Japan's SoftBank kicks off $10 bln India online spree, buys stake in Snapdeal","(Corrects name of venture capital firm in 9th paragraph) * Invests $627 mln in India’s 3rd-biggest e-commerce firm * Snapdeal ‘potential to be India’s Alibaba’ -Softbank’s Son * Funds needed to tackle rivals in India online retail boom * SoftBank also leads investment in Olacabs taxi app By Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Indulal PM MUMBAI, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Japanese telecom and media group SoftBank Corp has set its sights on Indian e-commerce in its aggressive expansion drive, saying it will invest about $10 billion in the booming sector as it took a strategic stake in one of its rising stars. Masayoshi Son, chief executive of SoftBank, laid out a 10-year investment plan for India on Tuesday, starting with the purchase of a $627 million stake in fast-growing online marketplace Snapdeal. Son’s global ambitions flared into public view last year when SoftBank bought No. 3 U.S. mobile carrier Sprint Corp for $21.6 billion. The Snapdeal purchase comes as international investors hunt deals in online retail in India, which has the world’s third-largest Internet user base but where e-commerce is still relatively underdeveloped. For cash-rich SoftBank, owner of a third of newly listed Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, the move is the latest in a series of deals designed to counter sluggish growth at home. “I have a strong willingness to invest more like $10 billion in the next 10 years,” Son said in an interview on Indian CNBC after his company announced plans to buy in Snapdeal, which connects small businesses with customers in an online marketplace. “I strongly believe that Snapdeal has the potential to be like the Alibaba of India.” In a separate deal announced on Tuesday, SoftBank said it will lead a $210 million investment round with existing investors in ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which owns a mobile application for taxi bookings that competes with the likes of Uber. SoftBank didn’t disclose how big a stake it will have in Snapdeal, which will use funds to expand operations to compete with bigger, free-spending rivals Flipkart.com and Amazon.com . The company did say it will become the biggest investor in Snapdeal, where sales of everything from clothes to computers have brought in around 25 million registered users and 50,000-plus merchants, attracting international shareholders like e-commerce operator eBay Inc and investment firm BlackRock Inc. One person with knowledge of the deal told Reuters SoftBank will own about 30 percent of New Delhi-based Snapdeal, buying new shares in the firm, valuing all of Snapdeal at around $2 billion. Snapdeal declined to comment on the terms of the deal. “SoftBank is a major investor in the internet space and them putting in a large sum of money validates the growth of Indian e-commerce,” said Niren Shah, managing director at venture capital firm Norwest Venture Partners. Pressure had been growing on Snapdeal to raise funds to compete as online retail surges in India, with local industry leader Flipkart raising $1 billion in July, and global e-commerce giant Amazon.com pledging to invest a further $2 billion in its India unit. The SoftBank investment is in line with the $600 million-$650 million sources told Reuters Snapdeal had been seeking, and is the biggest investment by a single investor in the e-commerce sector in India. With this round of investment, Snapdeal, founded by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal four years ago, has raised about $1 billion this calendar year. The company said it plans to use the money to ramp up technology and supply chain management systems, and add order fulfilment centres to 30 cities. The company currently has 40 fulfilment centres in 15 cities. Snapdeal will also look at making three or four bolt-on acquisitions in the coming few months specifically in the area of mobile technology and set up an incubation centre to work with start-up businesses in the mobile technology space, the company said. CEO Bahl, who has said he also wants Snapdeal.com to become “the Alibaba of India”, told Reuters in September that the company was focusing on improving its technology platform so that it could connect more small-scale enterprises with buyers. Snapdeal plans to expand its merchant base to 1 million in the next three years. Both deals were negotiated under newly appointed SoftBank Vice chairman and SIMI chief executive Nikesh Arora, reflecting the company’s recent aggressive overseas expansion. “India has the third-largest internet user base in the world, but a relatively small online market currently. This situation means India has, with better, faster and cheaper Internet access, a big growth potential,” Arora, a former Google executive, said in a statement. Arora will be joining both Snapdeal and ANI’s boards as part of the investment, SoftBank said.

709,BLK,Investor to object to proposed $4.5 bln JPMorgan settlement,"NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A group of funds that threw a monkey wrench in Bank of America Corp’s proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage-backed securities will object to JPMorgan Chase & Co’s $4.5 billion offer to settle claims over similar investments, according to the lawyer that represents them. The funds, collateralized debt obligations known as the Triaxx entities, received court permission on Wednesday to intervene in a proceeding seeking judicial approval of the JPMorgan settlement, people close to the case said. JPMorgan last year reached the $4.5 billion agreement with some 20 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which the bank took over during the financial crisis. The settlement would resolve claims over misrepresentations in the quality of mortgages packaged into securities before the collapse of the U.S. housing market. The Triaxx entities hold certificates with an original balance of some $1.5 billion in 13 of the covered trusts, according to court papers. Their claims are “potentially worth far more than the small percentage of the $4.5 billion settlement than they would receive,” John Moon, an attorney for Triaxx, argued in the papers, filed in New York state court in Manhattan, seeking permission to intervene. Moon later told Reuters he planned to object to the deal. Triaxx is the second investor to raise questions about the accord. On Oct. 21, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which has holdings in 37 of the trusts in the proposed settlement, asked for a three-month extension of the Nov. 3 deadline to object. On Wednesday, Justice Marcy Friedman of New York state Supreme Court also allowed the bank to intervene, but did not change the deadline, people close to the case said. Friedman’s chambers declined to comment. In August, trustees overseeing the securities accepted the bank’s offer for the vast majority of the trusts. Some 20 investors agreed to the deal last year, including BlackRock Inc, Metlife Inc, Allianz SE’s Pacific Investment Management Company, and Bayerische Landesbank. Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investor group, did not immediately return a call for comment. In June 2011, Bank of America reached a similar deal with an investor group in which the bank agreed to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims involving securities issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America acquired in 2008. A New York judge largely approved the Bank of America deal in January, although she refused to accept a portion objected to by Triaxx, involving loan modifications. Triaxx has since dropped its opposition, as did American International Group Inc, which led objectors to the settlement in a three-year legal battle. An appeals court is still weighing the settlement on behalf of other objectors. Oral arguments were held last week. The case is In re: the application of U.S. Bank National Association, et al, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan), No. 652382/2014.

710,BLK,BayernLB sells 6.5 bln euro asset-backed portfolio,"FRANKFURT, Oct 29 (Reuters) - German public-sector lender BayernLB has sold a 6.5 billion euro ($8.3 billion) portfolio of asset-backed securities (ABS), it said on Wednesday, drawing a line under a legacy of bad debts that brought it to the brink of failure in 2008. Germany’s second-biggest landesbank is benefiting from a surge in ABS prices after the European Central Bank (ECB) said it plans to start buying these assets, or bundled loans, and from a broad rebound in real estate markets. The securities were sold to international investors, including Bank of America, sources familiar with the transaction said. They were the remainder of a 21 billion euro loan portfolio that turned sour in the financial crisis and forced the state of Bavaria to inject 10 billion euros in capital into the lender and provide it with 4.8 billion in guarantees. The bank had been working since 2009 to cut the size of the package of securities, whose value is linked to developments in the U.S. housing market and European commercial real estate. BayernLB also sued several lenders for selling it the securities, while secretly criticising them internally and ultimately profiting from their failure. It has reached settlements in several cases. The Munich-based lender has booked a loss of 1.2 billion euros on the ABS portfolio and has said it will need to draw on some of the state guarantees. However, it expects the fees it is required to pay the state government for the guarantees to ultimately outweigh losses borne by the state. Blackrock Solutions, part of Blackrock Inc, is advising BayernLB on the sale of the ABS portfolio, two sources familiar with the deal said. BayernLB Chief Executive Johannes-Joerg Riegler and Bavaria’s Finance Minister Markus Soeder will host a press conference on the deal in Munich on Thursday. Bank of America declined to comment.

712,BLK,UPDATE 1-BlackRock's bond funds see biggest monthly inflows since May 1998,"(Adds detail, context) By Jessica Toonkel Nov 6 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s bond funds posted record monthly inflows of $5.2 billion in October, the most investors have poured into the firm’s bond funds since May 1998, according to data provided to Reuters from Morningstar. The inflows come as bond manager Pacific Investment Management posted outflows of $48.3 billion across its open-ended funds in October following the surprise departure of Bill Gross, adding to $25.5 billion of withdrawals the previous month, according to Morningstar data. BlackRock’s largest bond fund, its $22.8 billion Strategic Income Opportunities Fund saw record monthly inflows in October of $2.27 billion. That fund, which is an unconstrained bond fund, has ranked among the top quarter percentile of its category for the past one, three and five years, according to Morningstar. A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink told analysts last month that he sees a “sizeable opportunity in the tens of billions of dollars” in the fixed income space over the next several quarters. “We have seen recent strong momentum” in fixed income flows over past few weeks,” Fink said on the October 15 call. Analysts agree that BlackRock is well-positioned as clients move their money away from Pimco, which Keefe, Bruyette & Woods described in an Oct. 8 report as “the Bill Gross effect.” A majority of Pimco’s firm-wide outflows in October stemmed from investors pulling money from its flagship Pimco Total Return Fund, which was managed by Gross. According to Morningstar calculations, the Pimco Total Return Fund suffered an estimated $32.3 billion of outflows in October. That differs from Pimco’s reported $27.5 billion outflow because of differences in how Pimco reported the $5.6 billion in redemption requests from Sept. 30, Morningstar said. While BlackRock’s bond funds have seen inflows, the firm’s actively managed equity funds, which have stumbled in performance, saw $700 million in outflows for the month of October, according to Morningstar. Year to date investors have pulled $6 billion from those funds, according to Morningstar.

715,BLK,BlackRock's Rieder predicts Fed raises rates in June,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rick Rieder, BlackRock Inc’s chief investment officer for fixed income, predicted Monday that the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates in June. And as long as the Fed does raise rates at a slow pace, Rieder believes that U.S. equities will “go significantly higher.” “I think the equity market will confound people for the next year or so,” said Rieder, speaking at the 2014 Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York. Particularly with the cost of financing so attractive, more cash will come into equities and that increases the upside potential, he said.         Rieder said he believes the Fed should increase rates sooner than June because a 1 percent fed funds rate would help normalize savings conditions and let people retire who are not retiring today. Rieder’s big concern about the economy: high levels of student loan debt will curtail young Americans’ ability to take out mortgages to buy homes.  The number of U.S. consumers with student loans has jumped 350 percent from 2003 to 2013, and at the same time that of 27-year-old to 30-year-old borrowers with mortgage debt and student loans has dropped from 31 percent to less than 22 percent, Rieder said. “Student loans are the most underestimated dilemma facing the country today,” Rieder said. “If you go to college, you can’t get a mortgage.” Rieder oversees one of BlackRock’s biggest bond funds, the $22.8 billion Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, which attracted record monthly inflows in October of $2.27 billion. The fund’s inflows come as investors are moving money away from  bond manager Pacific Investment Management Company following the surprise departure of fund manager Bill Gross in September. Rieder said he is aware that unless performance is strong, investors will not stick around. The fund has ranked among the top 25 percent of its peers for the past one, three and five years, according to Morningstar. In October, Rieder said his group has increased its allocation to high-yield bonds, after cutting exposure to the asset class in July. “If you can clip a 6 percent ... it’s not a bad place to be,” he said. Rieder also likes Treasuries, saying he believes fair value of the 10-year Treasury note would be closer to a 2.75 percent yield than the current yield of 2.34 percent.

720,BLK,REFILE-Gold miners should curb output drive to reward investors-Blackrock,"(Refiles to correct typo in bullet point and paragraph 5) * Investors want transparency around investment decisions * Don’t want money ploughed back into business to boost output * Post 2016, average miner debt will cost an extra $100/ounce By Maytaal Angel and Silvia Antonioli LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. investment firm Blackrock  said gold miners looking to lure back fund flows need to cut production and give more money back to investors rather than ploughing it into the business in a bid to boost production. Early last month, gold prices fell to their lowest in more than 4 years at $1,131.85 a tonne - spurring struggling miners to take drastic measures like scrapping dividends, cutting jobs, halting projects and shutting mines. But according to Blackrock fund manager Evy Hambro, more needs to be done to restore investor confidence, and scrapping dividends is the wrong choice for debt burdened miners who need to raise cash from investors. “Gold companies need to understand if people are going to give them capital they need to have transparency around investment decisions,” Hambro said. “They don’t want capital ploughed back into the business chasing production growth rather than value creation.” “The primary thing (investors) want is ... when the gold price goes up, the company makes more money. They need to know with every ounce that’s mined there’s a margin attached to it,” he told the annual Mines and Money conference Gold equities are historically even more volatile than the metal. After outperforming the bullion price for most of this year, gold mining shares have given up all gains to sink much deeper than gold itself. According to some analysts, about three quarters of gold mining companies burn cash at spot prices just below $1,200 on an all-in cost basis. This is a huge problem especially for miners burdened by debt. “Over last decade (gold miners) have raised 150 billion in new capital. That debt is still on the balance sheet. They have to start repaying that debt ... post 2016 (when) it becomes equivalent to an extra $100 an ounce,” said Blackrock portfolio manager Catherine Raw at the conference. If gold prices fall to average $1,100, companies with heavy debt may be forced to hedge revenue or raise distressed equity. They could see their credit lines withdrawn or reduced.

Chang Hwa is due to elect a new board on Dec. 8. Foreign investors hold an up to 15 percent stake, Wu Tang-chieh, a deputy minister at the finance ministry, told Reuters, and their vote is likely to be key in determining who will ultimately control the bank. “If we win the seats we desire, there would be a significant boost of profits in Chang Hwa as we push for corporate governance,” Wu said, adding that the government did not want the bank to be merged with Taishin. Taishin officials were not immediately available to comment. Taishin, which counts investment firms BlackRock Inc  and Norges Bank as investors, is the top shareholder in Chang Hwa after buying a stake from the Taiwan government for $1.2 billion in 2005. The finance ministry, the second largest shareholder, wants to regain control of the lender, whose profits have been steadily rising, and has been pressing Taishin to cut its stake or reduce its seats to a minority on Chang Hwa’s board. . Taishin’s president has warned recently it could face a paper loss of more than T$10 billion in 2014 if it cedes control of Chang Hwa to the government in the voting.

724,BLK,UK watchdog bans former BlackRock manager for fare dodging,"LONDON (Reuters) - A former BlackRock investment manager has become only the second person to be banned for personal dishonesty by Britain’s financial watchdog after he was caught dodging fares worth 43,000 pounds ($67,000) on his daily commute into London. When the story broke in April, British newspapers quoted commuters angry that an anonymous hedge fund manger dubbed the “biggest fare dodger in history” was allowed to settle quietly with the railway company without being prosecuted. The story led to an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and Jonathan Paul Burrows, a senior figure at the world’s largest investment manager, was later unmasked by a newspaper. The FCA’s action against Burrows is a sign of how personal integrity is now seen as crucial as the financial sector seeks to restore its reputation after its worst crisis in decades, lawyers said. Burrows was a managing director at BlackRock Asset Management Investor Services and on Nov. 19, 2013, he was stopped by ticket inspectors at the exit gates of London’s Cannon Street station, the FCA said on Monday. Burrows was found to have failed to buy a valid ticket for his entire journey from Stonegate, East Sussex, the FCA said. The financial high-flyer admitted to evading fares on a number of occasions. “Burrows held a senior position within the financial services industry. His conduct fell short of the standards we expect,” said the FCA’s director of enforcement, Tracey McDermott. “Approved persons must act with honesty and integrity at all times and, where they do not, we will take action.” Burrows said he had always recognized that what he did was foolish. In March 2014 he paid a sum of money to Southeastern Trains that was significantly more than the value of the fares he had evaded, and British Transport Police will not be pursuing a case against him, Burrows added. Southeastern Trains calculated that Burrows dodged 43,000 pounds in fares, probably over five years. “While I respect the FCA’s decision today, I also regret it, coming as it did after a 20-year career in the City that was without blemish,” Burrows said. “I recognize that the FCA has on its plate more profound wrong-doing than mine in the financial services sector, and I am sorry that my case has taken up its time at this critical juncture for the future of the City and its reputation,” Burrows added. BlackRock said Burrows left the company earlier this year and that what he admitted to is contrary to its values and principles. Jacqui Hatfield, a financial services lawyer at ReedSmith, said the ban seemed to be harking back to the days when personal honor was the main quality for working in the City of London,  where the stock exchange’s motto is “my word is my bond”. The FCA said that Burrows had on a number of occasions paid only 7.20 pounds ($11), a third of the fare due, and had not told his employer. “Although the FCA is not penalizing Burrows for not informing his employer, the FCA has taken this into account, amongst other things, in deciding what action to take,” the FCA said. Most bans by the FCA are for life, but Burrows’ ban is only the second one for a lack of personal integrity not directly related to the job he is authorized for by the watchdog. In January, Anthony Verrier was banned for poaching staff from brokers Tullett Prebon when he joined rival BGC Partners. The High Court found that Verrier “departed” from the truth when the truth was “inconvenient”.

Jacqui Hatfield, a financial services lawyer at ReedSmith, said the ban seemed to be harking back to the days when personal honour was the main quality for working in the City of London,  where the stock exchange’s motto is “my word is my bond”. The FCA said that Burrows had on a number of occasions paid only 7.20 pounds ($11), a third of the fare due, and had not told his employer. “Although the FCA is not penalising Burrows for not informing his employer, the FCA has taken this into account, amongst other things, in deciding what action to take,” the FCA said. Most bans by the FCA are for life, but Burrows’ ban is only the second one for a lack of personal integrity not directly related to the job he is authorised for by the watchdog. In January, Anthony Verrier was banned for poaching staff from brokers Tullett Prebon when he joined rival BGC Partners. The High Court found that Verrier “departed” from the truth when the truth was “inconvenient”.

Burrows was a managing director at Blackrock Asset Management Investor Services and on 19 November 2013, he was stopped by ticket inspectors at the exit gates of London’s Cannon Street railways station, the Financial Conduct Authority said in a statement. He was found to have failed to purchase a valid ticket for the entire journey from Stonegate railway station, East Sussex, the FCA said.  Burrows was interviewed under caution and admitted to evading his rail fares on a number of occasions. “Burrows held a senior position within the financial services industry. His conduct fell short of the standards we expect,” FCA director of enforcement, Tracey McDermott said. “Approved persons must act with honesty and integrity at all times and, where they do not, we will take action.” ",12152014,http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-fca-burrows/uk-watchdog-bans-former-blackrock-employee-for-fare-evasion-idUSL6N0TZ1DN20141215

734,BLK,BlackRock expected to show its progress winning over retail investors,"(Reuters) - When BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, results are likely to show that a three-year effort to win the hearts and dollars of financial advisers and their retail clients has started to pay off, thanks to record inflows to the firm’s bond funds. Since BlackRock first took aim at mom and pop investors in 2011, it has launched a branding campaign and a reorganization of its sales force. Since then, the firm has gotten 500 of its actively managed investment strategies on brokerage platforms, including on the recommended lists of Wells Fargo Advisors, Raymond James, UBS UBSG.VS and other firms. The fund family is a top seller at Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and UBS, according to BlackRock.  After adding $37.7 billion through the first three quarters of last year, BlackRock’s retail actively managed business stood at $525.5 billion at the end of September.  That is a small slice of BlackRock’s $4.5 trillion in assets under management, but it is a key bottom-line contributor, because the funds bought by retail investors carry higher fees than those sold to institutional clients. Though they make up just 12 percent of assets, they account for 35 percent of fees. For every $10,000, an investor in a BlackRock retail fund pays around $64 a year, compared with $34 for an exchange traded fund and $10 for institutional clients, according to the firm.  “From a revenue perspective in regard to the fees compared to the institutional business, it is extremely important,” said Robert Fairbairn, global head of BlackRock’s retail and iShares business. “We believe that we can grow it at a clip that is faster than the industry.”  BlackRock has its bond offerings - along with the abrupt September resignation of Bill Gross from Pacific Investment Management Co - to thank for the growth in 2014 of its retail funds.  Seventy-two percent of the record $18.9 billion inflows into BlackRock’s mutual funds went straight into its top-performing, unconstrained bond fund, the $26.2 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BASIX.O), according to Morningstar. The firm’s bond funds had record inflows of $22.4 billion in 2014. “The concern is that this is hot money looking for a home outside of Pimco and it might not stick,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P; Capital IQ.  Fairbairn said the Pimco exodus was “a bit of a dividend for us,” but said BlackRock bond funds have been outperforming and attracting assets for years before that.  Eighty-five percent of BlackRock’s stock funds have underperformed their benchmarks over the last five years. In 2014 they posted record net outflows of $5 billion, according to Morningstar. On Tuesday, UBS Wealth Management told its advisers that it had dropped BlackRock’s Equity Dividend Fund MRVDX.O from its mutual fund select list due to concerns about the fund’s underperformance, increasing size and potential style drift, according to a memo obtained by Reuters.  “I have never looked at their equity funds - I basically didn’t even know they had them,” said Jacob Wolkowitz, director of investment research with Accredited Investors, a Minnesota- based adviser with $1.5 billion in assets under management, who moved money to BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities from the Pimco Total Return Fund last year.  Since 2012, BlackRock has replaced five of its nine U.S. equity teams. The firm’s push to turn around its U.S. equity performance “is still early in the process,” Fairbairn said.  In 2013, BlackRock reorganized its 150-person wholesale  force to enable salespeople accustomed to selling iShares ETFs to also sell mutual funds, and that has accounted for at least some of the success with retail investors, said Frank Porcelli, head of the U.S. wealth advisory business at BlackRock. Financial advisers agree. BlackRock’s wholesalers are more like “portfolio liaisons,” rather than pure sales people, said Daniel Roe, chief investment officer of Budros, Ruhlin, Roe, a Columbus, Ohio-based registered investment adviser with $2.1 billion, which started using BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund two years ago.  “They have a high level of knowledge about positioning and strategy,” he said. “That’s not always the case with other fund companies.”  In 2012, BlackRock also launched its first-ever branding campaign targeting retail investors, with ads appearing in publications such as The New York Times, The Economist and The Wall Street Journal as well as online. But the firm has a long way to go in gaining brand awareness when competing with the likes of Fidelity Investments and The Vanguard Group, which have been targeting individual investors for years, Porcelli said. “We are not nearly there in terms of name recognition,” Porcelli said. “But we used to be the firm that only financial advisers or the executives at big private banks knew.” ",1142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-retail-flows/blackrock-expected-to-show-its-progress-winning-over-retail-investors-idUSKBN0KN28720150114

737,BLK,UPDATE 3-BlackRock earnings beat estimates as 2014 inflows set record,"(Adds CEO commentary about fixed income flows) By Jessica Toonkel Jan 15 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as assets under management increased. The New York-based company ended the fourth quarter with $4.65 trillion in assets under management, up 8 percent from a year earlier. The firm had $87.8 billion in net inflows for the quarter. Long-term net inflows for the year came to $181.3 billion for an organic growth rate of 4.5 percent, up from 3.5 percent in 2013. The 2014 net inflows represent a 55 percent jump from the prior year and a record for BlackRock. “While the magnitude of the flows was quite large, it is the composition of the flows that was really interesting,” BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters. “We now manage over $1 billion in 41 different countries across the world.” Net income for the quarter fell to $813 million, or $4.77 per share, from $841 million, or $4.86 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a compensation program associated with shareholder PNC Financial Services Group Inc, earnings were $4.82 a share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of $4.68, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. BlackRock’s fourth-quarter flows went largely into its fixed income funds, making up 55 percent of long-term flows for the period. Investors poured $48.4 billion into BlackRock’s fixed income funds in the quarter. Half of the quarter’s long-term inflows went into BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded fund business, which ended the quarter with $1 trillion, a record for the company. BlackRock’s active retail business posted inflows of $23 billion, ending with $534.3 billion. The institutional business posted inflows of $20.7 billion for the quarter, ending with $2.8 trillion. BlackRock’s equity funds posted $28.7 billion in inflows for the quarter, while its multi-asset funds had $9.7 billion in inflows, and its alternatives funds posted $1 billion in inflows. BlackRock’s large inflows into its fixed income funds and ETFs came as bond manager Pacific Investment Management Co suffered outflows following the sudden resignation of its co-founder Bill Gross in September. Fink dismissed the notion that BlackRock’s fixed income flows were all due to Pimco, noting that the firm’s performance and flows were strong in an array of its fixed income products. “People are putting too much focus on Pimco,” Fink told Reuters. “There is a lot of money in motion ... If you look at the composition of our flows it would be hard to come to that conclusion.”   (Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Paul Simao)",1152015,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-results/update-3-blackrock-earnings-beat-estimates-as-2014-inflows-set-record-idUSL1N0UU0O720150115

739,BLK,U.S. investors favor currency hedged Europe ETFs as euro tumbles,"NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. investors stung by the falling euro who want to stay invested in Europe are turning to exchange-traded funds designed to strip out the impact of the region’s currency. The biggest among so-called “currency hedged” ETFs, the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity ETF, has already added some $576 million in new money since last Friday, and nearly $1 billion since the start of the year, ETF.com data show. “Currencies have become a huge part of global equity returns,” said Art Laffer Jr., a Nashville investment manager who uses a currency hedged ETF for his exposure to Germany. A currency hedged ETF strips out the foreign currency return of a given fund by investing in foreign currency forward contracts and rolling them, typically on a monthly basis. This can have a major impact on returns for U.S. investors in a region like Europe, where the euro has dropped dramatically. The WisdomTree hedged Europe ETF, for example, is up some 8.7 percent year-to-date, compared to some of the biggest unhedged Europe ETFs, the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF and the iShares Europe ETF, which are both up about 1.1 percent this year. On Friday, the euro dropped to an 11-year low against the dollar, after the European Central Bank announced on Thursday it would inject a trillion euros into the euro zone to revive a sluggish economy. It has fallen nearly 7 percent against the dollar so far in January, on track for its worst monthly performance in more than three years. Among other currency hedged funds that are outperforming their unhedged counterparts, the Currency Hedged MSCI EMU ETF  is up 7.6 percent year-to-date, far more than the 1.1 percent for the unhedged iShares MSCI EMU ETF. The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Germany ETF is up about 8.7 percent year-to-date, outperforming the 2 percent gain for the unhedged iShares MSCI Germany ETF. Major U.S. ETF providers like BlackRock Inc, WisdomTree Investments and Deutsche Bank AG  have all been rolling out new currency hedged funds over the past year to take advantage of the money that has been flowing into the ETFs. WisdomTree’s HEDJ, for example, was one of the biggest ETF asset gatherers last year, adding $5 billion in new money and growing its assets nine-fold over the year.

740,BLK,Dish's $3 bln wireless auction discount up for U.S. regulator review,"WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators will review a $3 billion discount claimed by Dish Network Corp and partners including investment management company BlackRock Inc  during a U.S. government wireless spectrum auction that ended this week. In a relatively common process for Federal Communications Commission auctions, Dish and partners invested in separate companies with little to no revenue that can receive a 25 percent discount in auction bidding. The FCC will now scrutinize the details of legal and financial ties of those separate companies to Dish and other corporations, aiming to make sure the airwaves will be used to compete against Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc  and others instead of turning the winnings over to incumbents. “From a Dish perspective, they just created $3.3 billion worth of value,” said Jonathan Chaplin at New Street Research. “Now we will see if they get away with it or not.” The companies spent $13.3 billion at the auction but provisionally received a $3.3 billion discount, results showed on Friday. The government gives the discounts with the goal of helping new entrants to the industry better compete with incumbents. The FCC has been leery of handing discounts to potential speculators or unknown entities unlawfully fronted by large corporations. That does not mean that large companies cannot support small entities, but the key is what the winning bidder does with the acquired spectrum, that it improves competition in the industry, said S. Jenell Trigg, telecom lawyer at Lerman Senter PLLC. “The objective to buying spectrum at auction is to provide service to the public,” she said. Speculation about Dish’s sights for its amassing spectrum has ranged from potentially building a wireless network of its own to selling the licenses to Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless company. Dish did not elaborate on its thinking, citing FCC’s anti-collusion rules. Analysts suggested that Dish’s partner bidding surpassing that of Verizon lowered the chances of an immediate sale to the biggest wireless carrier. Such a sale within the first year would invalidate the discount, experts said. FCC disclosures previously showed Dish and its chairman, Charlie Ergen, had indirect ownership in the partner entities that received the discount, Northstar Wireless LLC and SNR Wireless LicenseCo LLC. Investment management company BlackRock had membership shares in SNR.

Martin Small, who has been with BlackRock for nearly a decade, will shift into a new role as U.S. iShares head in March, according to a memo from iShares global head Mark Wiedman sent to employees on Sunday night. Small is joining iShares from the company’s BlackRock Solutions division, where he co-heads the U.S. client advisory business for its Financial Markets Advisory group. He first joined BlackRock in 2006. In the newly created role with iShares, Small will be responsible for leading operations across sales, marketing and communications, product, capital markets, and the iShares operating platform within the United States. He will report to Wiedman. Small will also join the iShares Global ExCo, which includes U.S. iShares executives Daniel Gamba and Raj Seshadri. Small’s move comes as BlackRock looks to build out its iShares franchise in the United States, its largest market. “We have big strategic ambitions in the United States,” Wiedman said in the memo. “Our leadership structure must suit these ambitions, with the ability to mobilize and direct resources across the U.S. iShares business.” BlackRock, the largest U.S. ETF provider, last year had a record $102.8 billion in global net flows in its iShares business. In the U.S. alone, investors poured $82.8 billion in new money into iShares funds, doubling its 2013 net flows and also setting a new record.

748,BLK,Exclusive: BlackRock to ramp up impact investing,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is planning an array of new investment products that will allow clients to invest in addressing large societal issues, such as global hunger or poverty, an executive at the New York-based firm said. BlackRock was set to announce on Monday a new initiative, called BlackRock Impact, to bring together its existing offerings that help clients invest in products with  environmental and societal goals, as well as introduce new products, Rich Kushel, chief product officer and head of strategic product management group, told Reuters.   BlackRock has tapped Deborah Winshel, the former president and chief operating officer of The Robin Hood Foundation, to oversee the initiative. Winshel, who begins her new role March 2 and will report to Kushel and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, will work with BlackRock’s portfolio managers globally to develop portfolios and tools to meet client demand and societal issues. Impact investing is not a new concept to Wall Street. A number of firms, like Goldman Sachs (GS.N), and Bank of America’s (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch unit are involved with social impact bonds that address a specific need, like reducing recidivism at a state prison, while bringing returns for investors.  BlackRock is looking at ways to make impact investing more scalable to address a range of issues. “What if you wanted to drive outcomes like poverty elimination or hunger elimination or the development of medicines?” Kushel said. He declined to elaborate on the products, but said he expects them to be launched “in the very near future.” BlackRock, with $4.65 trillion in assets under management, already has an array of funds and tools for clients looking to invest in a socially responsible way. For example, the world’s largest asset manager manages more than $220 billion in values based mandates, which use screens to exclude securities based on clients’ values. Additionally, the firm has a suite of  environmental, social and corporate governance-related products. In December, the firm launched the iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Exchange-traded Fund (CRBN.P). Winshel will also lead BlackRock’s global philanthropic program.

749,BLK,UPDATE 1-BlackRock president predicts stocks will still go up,"(Adds comments by BlackRock president, other details) Feb 11 (Reuters) - BlackRock President Rob Kapito said on Wednesday that he is still bullish on equities despite the current high valuations in the market. “I believe the equity markets are going to continue to rise,” Kapito said at the Credit Suisse Financial Services Conference in Miami. “Companies are buying back stock and raising dividends and there aren’t enough IPOs coming to market to replace that stock.” BlackRock has seen a number of large pension plans across the globe move significant portions of bonds into equities, Kapito said. In his remarks, Kapito was equally bullish on the growth of the exchange-traded fund market, predicting it will hit $6 trillion in assets in the next five years, up from $2.8 trillion at present. Individual investors, registered investment advisers and institutional investors are increasingly using ETFs to gain core exposure at a low cost, he said. But BlackRock also is seeing clients use ETFs in new ways. For example, Kapito said a growing number of investors are using ETFs instead of futures because they are cheaper. One area where Kapito was not bullish was the topic of how much investors are saving for retirement. “The Baby Boomers, Generation X and the older generation are not saving at all,” he said. Two-thirds of BlackRock’s assets under management are in retirement accounts of some kind, Kapito said. BlackRock next week is launching an advertising campaign, called “I Retire,” around the importance of retirement. The firm has a new website to help investors figure out how much they need to save for retirement.

751,BLK,Juicy yields on energy bonds attracting PE firms,"* Blackrock’s GSO preps new US$2bn energy fund * PE firms step in on new bond deals * Copycat trades like Linn drilling deal eyed By Natalie Harrison NEW YORK, Feb 13 (IFR) - Crude price volatility may not have completely closed the funding doors for US high-yield energy companies as private equity firms and new funds prepare to snap up juicy yields on offer after a recent slump in the sector’s bonds. In a likely sign of things to come, GSO Capital Partners, the alternative asset manager owned by Blackstone, last week deployed cash by providing a large order for CrownRock’s US$350m high-yield bond - the first such E&P; offering in months. The move came after Blackstone President Tony James said last month it has US$10bn in equity and debt capital available for energy investment opportunities. GSO is now raising a new fund solely for energy, expected to be US$2bn, a source familiar with the matter said. “We expect a number of transactions to happen in the next three months,” said Dwight Scott, a senior partner at GSO who focuses on the energy sector. “And it’s all about liquidity.” The same buyside investors burned by the sell-off in oil are now sifting through which companies they believe will outlast the slump in crude prices. And companies prepared to pay a premium are finding willing buyers. “We do not see oil prices getting back to US$100 in the long-term, so for us the big question is about whether the capital returns work,” Joe Lind, a portfolio manager at DDJ Capital Management, told IFR. “Are the costs of the company low enough that they can still operate in a world with lower revenues?” US crude prices have recovered from lows of US$43.5 just a couple of weeks back, inching back up to US$53. That has helped drive a 100bp rally in energy bond spreads in the past three weeks. But at 728bp over US government bonds, they still offer an extra 250bp spread to the broader high-yield sector, according to BAML. The new CrownRock bond, for example, came with a coupon of 7.75% and yield of 8% - nearly 200bp better than the current 6.2% yield-to-worst on the Barclays High Yield Index. In another example, GSO this week joined up with Magnetar Capital to provide US$300m of secured commitments to Texas-based driller Jones Energy to help repay borrowings under its revolver. The debt component, a US$250m eight-year bond, pays a hefty coupon of 9.25% - some 250bp higher than the 6.75% interest payment on a US$500m eight-year bond sold by the company in April 2014. The 2022 bonds have sunk to 91.75% of face value following the rout in energy names. The swoop back into junk-rated energy bonds is expected to be a saving grace for a sector that is facing dwindling access to funds from traditional bank lenders. The twice-yearly reset of revolvers and other loan agreements is always a fraught time for exploration and production companies, but this year will be trickier than most. There are roughly US$250bn of revolvers outstanding for US E&P; names, and some analysts expect that to be cut by at least US$25bn to US$37.5bn, or some 10% to 15%. “It might be a bit premature yet, but the reset of revolvers in the spring will likely be a catalyst,” said Jonathan Insull, a portfolio manager at Crescent Capital. “There will definitely be opportunities.” A head of US credit trading desk, meanwhile, said early signs were that banks were not being very aggressive just yet. “We’ve not seen many revolvers cut significantly, and in some cases they have even been increased,” said the trader. “The opportunities that funds are looking for are more likely to come in the fall, provided oil prices do not bounce back. Oil companies will have cut production more dramatically by then.” The US high-yield bond market remains virtually closed to all but the highest-quality borrowers - which leaves out the lion’s share of riskier E&P; names. Most refinancings thus are likely to be in the guise of second-lien loans, and investors intend to demand on strict covenants which offer them better protections. Joint ventures may also be on the horizon. GSO will fund the entire costs associated with drilling new wells for Linn Energy in return for 85% of their cashflows, until it reaches a 15% internal rate of return. “We provided dollars that sit outside of the capital structure,” said GSO’s Scott. “It’s good for the company as it doesn’t increase their leverage, and good for us as we don’t have to worry about the credit risk.” Other players are now looking at copycat trades. “It was a great deal,” said the trader. “It gives GSO a great return on a first lien basis, and also provides them with a link to Linn down the road if they need further financing. A lot of people are looking to replicate that deal.”   (Reporting by Natalie Harrison; Editing by Marc Carnegie and Shankar Ramakrishnan)",2132015,http://www.reuters.com/article/energy-highyield-funds/juicy-yields-on-energy-bonds-attracting-pe-firms-idUSL5N0VM6ED20150213
752,BLK,BlackRock set to launch first 'smart beta' bond fund,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc is planning to launch its first so-called “smart beta” bond fund that will adjust the holdings of a traditional bond index to achieve an equal balance of credit and interest rate risk. The fund, which is set to launch on Thursday, arrives at a time when the market for smart beta funds, or those that use factors other than market capitalization to weight their holdings, has been rapidly expanding in the equity space but is still in nascent stages for the fixed-income market. “You’ve seen this trend on the equity side, and I think you’re seeing it start to accelerate on the fixed-income side,” said Matt Tucker, head of iShares fixed-income strategy at BlackRock. “We definitely plan to expand this area and offer other options to investors.” BlackRock first told Reuters it was experimenting with smart beta bond strategies last May. Traditional bond index funds are dominated by issuers with the most outstanding debt and can be concentrated in certain segments of the bond market that carry more risk. Smart beta funds seek to reduce this risk by giving more weight to alternative factors such as corporate cash flow or economic growth rates of countries, or as in the case of the new BlackRock fund, credit and interest rate risk. The idea behind the new fund, which will be called the iShares Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF, is to weight its holdings so that the fund’s overall credit risk and interest rate risk are equally balanced 50/50. “For U.S.-based investors, rate risk and credit risk are the primary drivers of returns,” Tucker said. Interest rate risk has been in focus for investors expecting the Federal Reserve to raise rates later this year. In the benchmark Barclays Aggregate bond index, which is commonly tracked by traditional broad bond ETFs, interest rate risk is concentrated around 90 percent. BlackRock’s new smart beta fund will include mortgages, investment-grade corporate bonds with maturities between 1-5 years and 5-10 years and high-yield bonds rated BB and below. It will also use U.S. Treasury futures to adjust the fund’s interest rate risk up or down to match its credit risk profile.

763,BLK,UPDATE 1-British ETF price war heats up with BlackRock FTSE 100 fee cut,"* Cost for two flagship ETFs now 7 pence/100 stg invested * Market could go as low as 3 pence - Hargreaves Lansdown * Adds emerging market, niche fund fees likely to fall next   (Adds quote from Hargreaves Lansdown, context) By Simon Jessop LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has slashed the cost of investing in Britain’s oldest FTSE 100 exchange-traded fund, ratcheting up the pressure on rival providers such as Vanguard. Demand for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has surged in recent years as a result of often anaemic returns from more actively managed funds. BlackRock said on Tuesday that it would now charge 7 pence a year per 100 pounds invested in its ETF that pays out dividend income, down from 40 pence previously, to make it the cheapest such tracker on the market. Both Vanguard and Deutsche Bank charge 9 pence, it said. “It really doesn’t leave much more room to fall, but I don’t think the price war has ended,” said Adam Laird, head of ETFs at fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown. “In the U.S., you can get mainstream ETFs with fees as low as 0.03 percent.” However, he said he expected rival providers to wait and see if clients switched their money before responding. The iShares FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (Dist) fund was the first ETF to launch on the London Stock Exchange in 2000 and currently holds 3.8 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) of assets under management. BlackRock, which has more than $1 trillion of assets under management globally, said it would also cut to the same level the cost of its FTSE 100 ETF which reinvests dividend income. ETFs are equity instruments that allow an investor to trade a range of assets, from a basket of stocks to government debt. As the fund value tracks the value of its contents, it is cheaper than an actively managed fund. “We believe ETFs have an important role to play post the Retail Distribution Review and want to confirm our commitment to our clients in this market,” said Fergus Slinger, head of UK sales at iShares. By introducing the review in 2012, the British regulator removed an incentive for the country’s many independent financial advisors to funnel retail investor cash to commission-paying active funds rather than the cheaper ETFs. Demand for ETFs has grown since, also fuelled by the government’s decision last year to increase the amount of money investors can save tax-free, and could get another fillip when new pension investment freedoms go live in April. “In big markets like the UK FTSE 100, prices have fallen dramatically,” said Hargreaves Lansdown’s Laird. “Where I think we’re likely to see the next round of moves, though, is in some of the niche markets, such as emerging markets, where fees tend to be higher, at around 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent.”   ($1 = 0.6620 British Pounds)   (Editing by David Evans and Pravin Char)",3102015,http://www.reuters.com/article/ishares-ftse/update-1-british-etf-price-war-heats-up-with-blackrock-ftse-100-fee-cut-idUSL5N0WC28220150310
764,BLK,UPDATE 2-UK watchdog to keep close eye on corporate bond market's liquidity,"* Regulator says not yet decided if intervention needed * Industry warns about impact of EU rules on liquidity   (Adds industry letter to regulators) By Huw Jones LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Britain’s financial regulator said on Tuesday that a low liquidity in corporate bond markets, which could create volatility in times of stress, needed careful monitoring. But trying to improve liquidity by relaxing strict new capital requirements imposed on banks since the financial crisis  was not an option, the regulator said. Investors have poured money into corporate bonds since the crisis to boost returns but this has prompted concerns that some markets do not have enough liquidity to cope with a rush for the exits when interest rates start to rise. Commentators have warned this could result in fire-sale prices and extreme volatility in markets. The liquidity issue has also arisen at a time when the European Union is looking to build a “capital markets union” to plug gaps in corporate funding left by banks that have reined in lending. Edwin Schooling-Latter, head of market infrastructure at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told a FIX Trading conference that the state of the secondary corporate bond market, where bonds are traded after they have been sold to investors, was on the regulatory agenda. “There is enough evidence that low liquidity relative to previous years does warrant careful regulatory monitoring of market developments and careful consideration of what could be done to improve levels of liquidity,” he said. “We don’t see a single silver bullet.” Morgan Stanley has said that the average number of dealers per trade in the bond market has dropped to 3.2 in January this year from nearly 9 in 2009. This reflects the new capital requirements banks have to meet which banks say has made bond trading more costly. Schooling-Latter said that before regulators themselves intervened they must ask if there is a market failure. “We would certainly be interested in views from market participants if that is the case.” “The focus of policy makers’ attention is not on reversing new prudential requirements,” Schooling-Latter said. Enhancing price transparency was one option under consideration as a way to make investors more willing to trade, he said. Other ideas included improving trading platforms, more retail participation, greater standardisation of bond issuance and making the allocation of initial issuance more transparent, Schooling-Latter said. Bond issuers also have a key role to play such as encouraging platform trading in their bonds at the outset to reach a wider range of investors, he added. He said it was timely to review primary market regulation such as easing EU rules on prospectuses for issuers, a step Brussels is already looking at to boost market-based financing. Separately, industry bodies like the French and Dutch asset management associations, Britain’s The Investment Association, as well as investment groups such as BlackRock and Aviva, have proposed changes to planned EU bond market transparency rules known as MiFID II. They said it was “highly challenging” to apply the MiFID II rules to less widely traded bonds without crimping market efficiency. “To deliver sustainable economic growth in the EU, the starting point for MiFID II ... needs to be the interests of Europe’s saving and investing citizens and companies,” they said  in a letter, seen by Reuters, to the EU securities watchdog ESMA.

766,BLK,February another bumper month for oil ETPs: BlackRock,"LONDON (Reuters) - Interest in oil and other energy-related exchange traded products (ETPs) continued for a fifth consecutive month in February with almost $2 billion of inflows, according to the latest global data from BlackRock, pushing assets under management (AUM) to over $13 billion. This was almost as much as the $13.8 billion of assets under management in broad-basket commodity ETPs, but BlackRock’s Ursula Marchioni, head of ETP research at iShares EMEA, said it fell short of a record. “At year-end 2009 global energy ETPs had a total AUM of $14 billion as the underlying energy prices were higher at that time,” she said. Energy was the best performing sector in the S&P; Goldman Sachs Commodity index in February, with Brent oil up 14.9 percent. Marchioni said that if this price trend continued in the coming months, energy ETPs could reach historical highs in total assets under management. Investors piled into oil ETPs after Brent sold off in 2014, in the hope of taking advantage of an eventual rebound in prices. “For Brent, there’s a lot of reliance on OPEC pulling back production at some point,” Nitesh Shah, associate director at ETF Securities, said. But there has also been an increase in flows into the company’s short WTI crude ETPs in the last week, Shah added, suggesting some investors are taking a contrarian view. “That’s largely related to the inventory builds at Cushing – investors see an opportunity to take a tactical short,” he said. U.S. crude stocks at the key delivery point of Cushing, Oklahoma, hit fresh record highs in February as shale oil production continued unabated.  Broad-basket commodity ETPs attracted some $329 million in net inflows in February, a reversal from January’s $300 million of net outflows, which Marchioni said had been driven by one U.S.-listed product. “As long as the crude price stabilizes in the next few months we expect to see some renewed interest in broad-market commodity ETPs given the significant weight energy has within these broad market indices,” she said. Gold ETPs attracted $1.1 billion, with European investors seeking a store of value following the quantitative easing program announced by the European Central Bank. This has added to the depreciation pressure on the euro relative to the U.S. dollar [FRX/], Marchioni said. Shah also cited uncertainty around Greece and the renegotiation of its debt payments.

768,BLK,CORRECTED-Europe's junk bond ETPs sees largest recorded inflows in Feb -BlackRock,"(Corrects date) By John Geddie LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - European-listed junk bond exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded their biggest monthly inflows in February, data from BlackRock showed, while cash was pulled out of German government and money market ETPs. Fixed income ETPs represent a fraction of the 105 trillion dollar global bond market, but the data, which covers only funds listed in Europe, provides evidence of an investor hunt for yield against a backdrop of ultra-loose monetary policy and record low interest rates. ETPs encompass any portfolio of securities that trade intra-day on an exchange, and include exchange traded funds (ETFs), exchange traded notes (ETNs), exchange traded commodities (ETCs) and exchange traded instruments (ETIs). Junk bond ETPs gained 1.3 billion euros in February, adding nearly 20 percent to their total assets under management. It was the biggest jump since BlackRock began tracking the ETP industry in 2008. Other higher-yielding funds also saw strong inflows. Emerging market ETPs gained 800 million euros, the most in nine months, while 1.3 billion euros came into investment grade corporate funds. Ahead of the European Central Bank’s sovereign bond-buying programme which started this month, there were modest inflows of 477 million euros into ETPs covering euro zone government debt. But on a country-by-country basis, money came out of top-rated German funds and flowed into the indebted Italy and Spain. Approximately 207 million euros came out of German government ETPs in February, while 122 million euros went into Italy and 95 million euros into Spain. All German bonds out to seven years maturity now yield below zero, meaning investors are effectively paying to lend to governments. Italian five-year government bonds yield around 0.4 percent. Money market ETPs, which have seen significant annual outflows in recent years, lost another 306 million euros. While ETPs are well established in equity markets, they are relatively in fixed income new product and make up only around 0.4 percent of global outstanding bonds. At the end of February, BlackRock tracked 5,462 exchange-traded products globally.

771,BLK,German watchdog slaps 3.25 mln euro fine on BlackRock,"FRANKFURT, March 20 (Reuters) - German financial market watchdog Bafin has imposed a 3.25 million euro ($3.47 million) fine - the regulator’s largest ever - on investment manager BlackRock for publishing faulty corporate voting rights disclosures. “The incorrect or late disclosures were attributable to a mistaken interpretation of German disclosure rules and related to a number of German large cap issuers,” Bafin said in a statement on its Internet site on Friday. Bafin said BlackRock had accepted the fine and had itself come forward to clarify errors and introduce changes to prevent similar violations of the rules in future - positive behaviour that Bafin took into account when setting the level of the fine. Other asset managers were likely to come forward in the coming months, seeking a clean slate from Bafin ahead of much tougher fines being imposed under revised EU disclosure transparency rules that come into force in November, said Jochen Kindermann, a lawyer at Simmons & Simmons in Frankfurt. “The mistakes that asset managers have made are often the result of Germany’s complex interpretation of the disclosure rules,” Kindermann said, adding that the new rules should be simpler for companies to uphold. The incentive to clear up problems now is also driven by an obligation on Bafin to publish the names of companies that commit violations under the new rules, which the regulator has been loath to do up to now. “The ‘name and shame’ concept is something completely new to Germany,” Kindermann said.

In a separate statement, Pemex said the joint stake was equivalent to 45 percent of the costs involved in the construction of the project. It represents BlackRock’s first ever infrastructure investment in Mexico, Pemex added. “The company has the intention of establishing a greater presence in Mexico,” Pemex said in the statement. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, was looking to invest in infrastructure projects in Mexico. The move also comes as Mexico’s government, which has seen the peso fall to record lows off the back of an oil price slump that has dented the appeal of its energy sector opening, sets about courting private investment. Pemex said in September it would spend $2.5 billion on the second phase of the Los Ramones pipeline, which will eventually run from the U.S.-Mexico border to central Mexico to help satisfy growing demand for gas by boosting cheap imports from the United States.

776,BLK,UPDATE 1-EI Towers shareholders back bid for Rai Way,"(Adds comments from chief executive, background) By Claudia Cristoferi MILAN, March 27 (Reuters) - Italian broadcast tower operator EI Towers, controlled by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Mediaset group, won backing from shareholders on Friday for its bid to acquire state-owned rival Rai Way. It still faces government opposition, however. Chief Executive Guido Barbieri appeared to soften the group’s earlier demand for a share of at least two thirds in Rai Way, controlled by the government through state broadcaster Rai, saying 51 percent would be a “logical” limit and even leaving the door open to a lower stake. “We would certainly not accept 49 percent without guarantees on governance,” he said after a shareholders meeting to approve a cash call to fund the 1.2 billion euro ($1.3 billion) bid. As well as Mediaset, EI Towers shareholders include major investment funds like Amber Capital, BlackRock, Octavia Advisors and Threadneedle Asset Management. EI Towers announced a 1.2 billion euro ($1.30 billion) bid for Rai Way last month but ran into the government’s insistence that at least 51 percent of Rai Way would have to remain in public ownership. The bid is being closely watched in Rome for its possible impact on relations between Berlusconi and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who is pushing to complete wide-ranging reform of electoral laws that will require broad support in parliament. However the government has shown no sign of relaxing its requirement that a majority of Rai Way remains in public hands and Industry Minister Federica Guidi said it would not change ownership rules to allow a bid. Bourse regulator Consob has also asked for further clarification on the bid from the company. Barbieri denied that Mediaset, which owns 40 percent of EI Towers, had anything to do with the proposed acquisition and he said he had never been in touch with Berlusconi over the deal. But it remains highly sensitive politically at a time when Renzi is trying to hammer out a far-reaching reform of the electoral law that he will struggle to pass without the cooperation of Berlusconi’s centre-right Forza Italia party. He said the group, which has so far not been in direct touch with either Rai Way or Rai, would take the initiative to open communications. “We’ll do it soon, we’ll assess whether we do it with both,” he said. One of the original conditions for the bid to go through is that EI Towers wins at least 66.67 percent of the capital of Rai Way but Barbieri’s comments on Friday appeared to indicate the group was softening its demands.

Temasek plans to invest about 30 million pounds ($44.4 million) and a deal could come in the next few weeks, Sky said, citing unnamed sources. Peer-to-peer (P2P) loans allow investors to lend directly to individuals and businesses, cutting out banks via low-cost online platforms. Funding Circle has lent over 588 million pounds to British businesses. Britain’s alternative finance market is forecast to more than double this year to 4.4 billion pounds, according to a 2014 study.

780,BLK,BlackRock to close or combine some money-market funds - WSJ,"April 6 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest money manager, will close or consolidate some money-market funds as the company responds to recent regulatory reforms, the Wall Street Journal reported. BlackRock is considering changing its fund lineup to comply with rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in July, the company said in a letter to clients on Monday, according to the report. (on.wsj.com/1DcZbse) The SEC adopted reforms requiring “prime” money funds used by institutional investors to float their values, instead of letting them maintain a stable value at $1 per share. The goal is to prevent investors from getting spooked by the prospect of funds breaking the buck, or their net asset value falling below $1 per share. BlackRock has about 50 money-market funds, and the changes will affect more than $200 billion in client assets and will leave it with about 30 funds, the Journal reported.

781,BLK,State Street may roll out more ETFs linked to star managers,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Ron O’Hanley, the new leader of State Street’s (STT.N) $2.45 trillion asset management division, says he will look closely at expanding the bank’s stable of bond-related products as exchange-traded funds run by rivals Vanguard and BlackRock have been more dominant in attracting investor money. The 58-year-old O’Hanley started his new job as the head of State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) on Monday. A former top executive at Fidelity Investments, O’Hanley replaces SSgA CEO Scott Powers, 56, who will help with the transition after overseeing several years of robust growth in the division.  At SSgA, most of its assets, about $1.5 trillion, are invested in equity-related products such as the $185 billion SPDR S&P; 500 ETF Trust (SPY.P). O’Hanley said last week in a telephone interview that he will look at expanding SSgA’s base of fixed income assets, which total about $320 billion. “Clearly I need to spend time on this,” O’Hanley said.  Collaborating with well-known active fund managers is one place to build on. O’Hanley cited State Street’s recent collaboration with Jeff Gundlach, the star bond fund manager at DoubleLine. In late February, State Street and Gundlach launched the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF (TOTL.P), which Morningstar said could pose a challenge to the $2.6 billion PIMCO Total Return ETF (BOND.P). “The relationship with DoubleLine is pretty attractive,” O’Hanley said. “Clearly it something we have to look at more.” But as fund research firm Morningstar Inc pointed out recently in a report, “Vanguard is doing great. PIMCO is really struggling. Everybody else is doing all right.” Net deposits in Vanguard Group’s passively run funds such as index funds and ETFs totaled $225.3 billion for the 12 months that ended Feb. 28, according to Morningstar. Net deposits for BlackRock (BLK.N) were $97 billion and SSgA had $30 billion, Morningstar said. O’Hanley is well aware of Vanguard, a fund flows juggernaut that for years has sapped the strength of Fidelity, where he worked from 2010 to 2014. Before Fidelity, O’Hanley ran the investment management division of Bank of New York Mellon. But Fidelity had no ETF business to speak of when he arrived on the scene. State Street, along with Vanguard and BlackRock, are the ETF industry’s three dominant players.  “What’s attractive for State Street is that it has the building blocks for investors who more and more desire a customized investment solution,” O’Hanley said.

782,BLK,BlackRock bullish on emerging markets debt,"(Reuters) - BlackRock sees opportunities to invest in emerging markets debt, despite the rising U.S. dollar and an expected increase in U.S. interest rates this year, executives said Thursday. Given the amount of deleveraging in some emerging markets countries over the past several years, and the unpredictability of other markets, like the European credit market, investors should consider emerging markets debt, BlackRock’s bond managers said at a breakfast roundtable Thursday morning in New York. Traditionally when the Fed moves, the thinking is that investors have to get out of emerging markets, but that is no longer true, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income and co-head of Americas fixed-income at BlackRock. “We think you can create opportunities in more stable parts of the world,” Rieder said. Specifically, BlackRock sees opportunities in India, Indonesia and Mexico, which it views as  high-quality countries with strong balance sheets, said Amer Bisat, an emerging markets portfolio manager in BlackRock’s fixed income group. “We are happy to take on the interest rate risk in these local markets,” he said. The firm also sees opportunities in the sovereign credit of  countries like Mexico, Indonesia as well as Slovenia, Bisat said. Meanwhile, the firm is short or underweight Venezuela, Ukraine, South Africa and Turkey, which have deteriorating credit. To be sure, emerging markets is facing an “inhospitable environment,” Bisat said. Headwinds include collapsing commodity prices; a deterioration in global trade as more developed countries rely on emerging markets less; an increasing cost of capital and the rising value of the U.S. dollar, Bisat said. The spread between emerging markets growth and developing markets growth has dropped from seven percent in the mid 2000s to two percent currently, he said. But many emerging markets countries have stronger balance sheets than they have had in the past 30 years and are better equipped to deal with these challenges, Bisat said. “There are buckets of value that are actually quite interesting,” he said. Still, the foreign exchange market as the U.S dollar rises in value will continue to be a headwind for emerging markets, Bisat said. “We have so far continued to play the emerging markets FX for the short side,” Bisat said.

784,BLK,BlackRock's Fink tells S&P; 500 firms to think long-term,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc chief Larry Fink has asked the top executives of the 500 largest publicly listed U.S. companies urging them to take a long-term approach to create value for shareholders or risk losing his firm’s support. In a letter to the chief executive officers of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, Fink asked the companies to avoid short-term pressures created by the increasing activist shareholder activity of recent years.  “It is critical ... to understand that corporate leaders’ duty of care and loyalty is not to every investor or trader who owns their companies’ shares at any moment in time, but to the company and its long term owners,” Fink wrote in the letter, dated March 31.  BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager. At the end of 2014, it had $4.65 trillion of assets under management. In 2014, dividends and buybacks in the United States totaled $900 billion, the highest ever, according to the letter. Through March, buyback authorizations totaled $257 billion, the fastest start to any year on record, according to Birinyi Associates. Many market analysts expect that a rise in interest rates will not derail the buyback boom bolstering stocks.   The company made Fink’s letter available to Reuters after The New York Times first reported on the document on Monday evening, ahead of the company’s scheduled release of first-quarter results on Thursday. Given the low interest rate environment, such moves “send a discouraging message about a company’s ability to use its resources wisely and develop a coherent plan to create value over the long-term,” Fink wrote Corporate boards should act as “the first line of defense” against short-term pressures.”  In the last two years, activists have taken positions in some of the largest U.S. corporations seeking larger share repurchases, divestitures or other corporate action. The companies targeted included Apple Inc, General Motors Co, DuPont and Qualcomm Inc.  Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co, which has $8.2 billion in assets under management, disagrees with Fink and believes most activists now are more long-term than the corporate raiders of the 1980s.  “I think the majority of activist investors today are really investors and are not going into this to slash and burn,” Smith told Reuters in an interview Tuesday afternoon. For example, Smith applauded Nelson Peltz’ Trian Fund Management LP for taking a long-term approach with its campaign against the management of chemicals and agricultural company DuPont.  Trian is pushing the company’s board to be more accountable and argues it should be split in two. The fund is pushing for four seats on DuPont’s board. “I think Trian represents a positive influence,” he said. Smith also disagrees with Fink that dividends are a sign  companies are thinking short-term.  “Dividends are the mother’s milk of returns to investors,” said Smith, who only invests in companies that pay them. “Dividend increases are the most tangible statement management can make about the firm’s fundamentals and future prospects.” For its part, BlackRock has revised its proxy guidelines to highlight it expects board members to protect shareholders against short-term thinking.  Firms that have a long-term strategy to create shareholder value, as well as credible metrics to assess performance, will have BlackRock’s support during periods of underperformance.  “In such cases, we will take action to ensure that the owners’ interest are effectively served,” he wrote.  Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles and known as the Warren Buffett of bonds, shared Fink’s sentiments. “In a number of cases, in the tech area among the most prominent of the examples, is where you ought to be reinvesting in the business,” he said. “There’s too much catering to quarterly earnings engineering slash activist shareholders.”  ",4142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-fink/blackrocks-fink-tells-sp-500-firms-to-think-long-term-idUSKBN0N52EF20150414

787,BLK,UPDATE 1-BlackRock mandates banks for potential euro senior bond,"(Adds quotes, background) By Alice Gledhill LONDON, April 14 (IFR) - BlackRock is planning to sell a debut bond issue in the single currency which will test investor appetite for this type of credit and so-called reverse Yankee issuance. The world’s largest money manager has mandated Barclays, Citigroup and JP Morgan to arrange a two-day European roadshow from April 20. A benchmark deal is expected to follow. Issuance from US credits in euros was one of the dominant trends of the first quarter with over 27bn raised by investment-grade companies. However, the pace has slowed dramatically in recent weeks  and BlackRock will provide a test of how much investor appetite there currently is for this type of supply. “It’s an interesting mandate,” said one debt banker. “They probably need euros directly - this would make sense, as they have activities across the globe.” But he warned that it could divide opinion among investors, despite the strength of the brand name. “Some people won’t buy it because they won’t want to fund a competitor, and would rather hold equity instead.” Blackrock is a more familiar presence in the US funding market. It has over USD4.6bn of bonds outstanding, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. It is rated A1/AA- by Moody’s/S&P;, both ratings with a stable outlook.

BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, also reported that first-quarter profit rose by 8.7 percent, and adjusted earnings topped estimates. Investors poured $70.4 billion into BlackRock’s funds overall in the first quarter, a 162 percent increase from a year ago. More than half of that, $36 billion, went to fixed income funds, more than double from the same period last year.

He declined to say if first-quarter inflows were coming at the expense of Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco), which started losing assets to BlackRock after co-founder Bill Gross left Pimco unexpectedly last September.

792,BLK,BlackRock's Fink favors equities in Europe over U.S.: CNBC,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s chief executive officer Larry Fink said on Thursday that he is bullish on European equities and believes that Europe’s GDP will beat that of the U.S. in the first quarter. “Europe is going to be the surprise for the year,” he said on CNBC. Fink said the lower valuation of the euro has given European companies a big competitive advantage over their U.S.-based counterparts. That along with low oil prices and a more stable European banking system means that European equities are poised to outperform U.S. equities, he said. “I like European and Asian equities more than U.S. equities,” he said.  Given the three-year run that U.S. equities have had, “it’s catch up time,” he said. Already, Fink has seen clients pouring into its European equity funds as investors look for yield in the low interest rate environment, he said. Low interest rates in Europe are “truly harming” European pension funds and insurance companies, he said. “This is one of the areas where I don’t believe that central banks appreciate what negative rates do,” he said. Going forward, Fink believes oil prices will stay between $60 to $80 per barrel as there continues to be more supply pressure than demand. Fink also discussed his recent letter to the CEOs of the 500 largest publicly listed U.S. companies urging them to resist short-term activists. Fink said that not all activists are short-term and noted that BlackRock has voted with activists about 55 percent of the time.

795,BLK,BlackRock to pay $12 million in SEC conflict of interest case,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, one of the world’s largest asset managers, agreed to pay $12 million to resolve civil charges that one of its unit failed to disclose a conflict of interest created by one of its top portfolio managers. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday that BlackRock Advisors LLC breached its fiduciary duties to clients by failing to disclose that Daniel Rice, who oversaw some energy funds, was running a family-owned oil and natural gas company that partnered with a coal company that later became the largest holding of a fund he ran for BlackRock. A top senior compliance officer at BlackRock Advisors at the time, Bartholomew Battista, agreed to a related $60,000 penalty, the SEC said.  Neither BlackRock nor Battista admitted or denied the SEC’s findings in agreeing to settle, and BlackRock also agreed to engage an independent compliance consultant to conduct a review. The company first disclosed the SEC probe in a filing last year. “BlackRock has extensive policies and procedures in place to manage conflicts of interest, including employees’ outside activities,” spokesman Brian Beades said. “However, this has been a learning experience for our firm and we have taken a number of additional steps to further enhance our policies and procedures.” An attorney for Battista could not be immediately reached. The SEC said that Rice, who departed BlackRock in 2012, was involved in managing energy funds for his employer at the same time he founded Rice Energy, a family-owned oil and natural gas company. The SEC said Rice personally invested $50 million in Rice Energy, which later formed a joint venture with a publicly-traded coal company that rose to become the largest holding in the $1.7 billion BlackRock Energy and Resources portfolio. The regulator said BlackRock knew and approved of Rice’s activities, but failed to disclose the conflict to the boards of the BlackRock funds and to clients. Julie Riewe, the co-head of the SEC’s asset management enforcement unit, said Monday this case marks the first time the SEC has charged a firm over failing to report a “material compliance matter” to a fund board. “BlackRock and Battista caused the funds’ failure to report Rice’s violations of BlackRock’s private investment policy and denied the funds’ boards critical compliance information,” she added.

806,BLK,BlackRock CEO's long term view is 'healthy': Eaton chief,"(Reuters) - As his company gets closer to telling shareholders its plan for allocating cash, Eaton Corp Chief Executive Alexander Cutler said on Wednesday a recent call by a prominent asset manager to think long-term represented a “healthy voice.” BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink earlier this month sent a letter to CEOs of the Standard & Poor’s 500 companies urging them to take a long-term approach to create value for shareholders or risk losing his firm’s support. Fink asked the companies to avoid short-term pressures created by the increasing activist shareholder activity of recent years. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was Eaton’s fourth-largest shareholder as of Dec. 31, according to Thomson Reuters data. “He is articulating what we hear from many investors,” Cutler said in an interview after the diversified U.S. manufacturer of electrical and power products reported first-quarter results. “They invest in these companies for the long term, not simply for the next three months.” He added that Fink represented a “healthy voice.” Eaton expects by midyear to convey to shareholders his company’s highly anticipated plans for using its cash, now that it has digested and paid down debt tied to a $11.8 billion acquisition of Cooper Industries. After continuing to increase Eaton’s dividend “we’re still going to have a lot of available cash in years going forward, and we want to provide investors with some insight,” Cutler said. This included the extent it might spend on share buybacks or acquisitions. Eaton lowered its 2015 profit forecast on Wednesday, but the projected range still included analysts’ average estimate for the year. Its shares closed up 1.4 percent. Eaton’s results came as the U.S. Commerce Department reported that first-quarter economic growth expanded at only a 0.2 percent annual rate, a big step down from the fourth quarter’s 2.2 percent pace and the weakest reading in a year.  “We’re continuing to see the economy sort of slog along at somewhat disappointing growth levels for this late in a recovery,” Cutler said. The inability for the economy to reach 3 percent growth is one reason employment has not expanded more significantly, Cutler said. While Eaton does not provide employment forecasts, Cutler said: “I don’t anticipate that unless the economy grows faster, that net employment is going to be a substantial plus.”     ",4292015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eaton-corp-ceo/blackrock-ceos-long-term-view-is-healthy-eaton-chief-idUSKBN0NK2MB20150429

BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, announced in March that Raw was leaving to take a corporate position in the mining sector. She had headed the firm’s mining fund with BlackRock veteran Evy Hambro since 2011. Barrick said Raw’s experience at one of the top investors in the mining sector gives her an intimate knowledge of the global mining investment universe. She will seek greater rigor in financial analysis, planning and performance management across the company.

At the annual meeting this week, shareholders revolted against its executive compensation plan, especially a $12.9 million pay package for Thornton. Nearly three-quarters of the shares voted at the meeting were against the company’s advisory say-on-pay vote, and shareholders also expressed their displeasure by withholding a large number of votes from members of the board’s compensation committee. Thornton vowed to fix the executive compensation plan, especially his own package.

810,BLK,Investors pull $1.2 billion from energy ETPs in April: BlackRock,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors pulled $1.2 billion from energy exchange-traded products (ETPs) in April, banking profits after oil prices rallied some 20 percent over the month, the latest global data from asset manager BlackRock showed. It was a sharp reversal from the first quarter of 2015, when investors piled into oil ETPs trying to position for a rebound when production numbers start to dip. But with Saudi Arabia pumping at near-record highs in an attempt to win a battle for market share against U.S. shale production, crude supply continues to outweigh demand.   Towards the end of March there were signs that investor fatigue had set in, as negative roll yields eroded profits. The April rally then gave some investors an opportunity to cash in. “With the fundamental outlook for oil not improving significantly, outflows are likely short-term investors taking money off the table after a nice recovery in oil prices since late March,” Ursula Marchioni, head of ETP research at BlackRock’s iShares EMEA, said. “Oil ETPs are not ideal for longer-term bets due to roll costs eroding returns and the market has been in contango ever since the ETP flows began to pick up late last year,” she added. Energy was the best-performing sector in the S&P; GSCI in March, up 17.4 percent, with all petroleum commodities reporting double-digit gains. But the persistent weakness in physical crude markets suggests oil futures may sell off again. Nitesh Shah, commodities research associate at ETF Securities, an issuer of ETPs, said outflows from oil ETPs had continued into May. “The rally was a bit premature because global oil supply hasn’t really tightened yet,” he said. He suggested that some investors had taken profits in April in case OPEC chooses not to cut production at its June meeting, and prices fall again.  Gold ETPs had modest inflows in April after outflows of over $2 billion in March. Shah partly attributed this reversal to nervousness around the outcome of Greece’s debt negotiations. Broad basket commodity ETPs attracted $128 million, mainly driven by an improving outlook for industrial metals, which rallied strongly over April.  “They had a good month on expectations of supplies tightening, and investors seem more optimistic about commodities in general,” Shah said.  Aluminum, tin and nickel ETPs have attracted decent inflows in recent weeks, he added.

812,BLK,RPT-BlackRock says regulators misunderstand securities lending risks,"(Repeats story from Wednesday with no changes to text) By Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON, May 13 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc on Wednesday pushed back against arguments by the New York Federal Reserve and other regulators that asset managers’ securities lending operations may pose major risks to the market and may need greater oversight. In a seven-page white paper seen by Reuters, the world’s largest money manager says financial regulators misunderstand securities lending and are overstating its risks with regard to  the industry as a whole, and BlackRock in particular. The defense comes as regulators, including the Federal Reserve, raise concerns about potential dangers lurking in the asset management industry, citing its rapid growth, massive scale, and liquidity risks in the event of a financial panic. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a body of U.S. regulators chaired by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, has been particularly focused on how the sector operates. It has the power to label large non-banks as “systemic” - a  designation that compels greater oversight which has already been extended to insurers like American International Group  and Metlife. The asset management industry worries it could be next in line and has lobbied fiercely against the so-called Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) designation. Regulators including the FSOC, the Federal Reserve and others have all raised concerns about the practice in which pensions, mutual funds and other institutional investors lend out their securities to banks and hedge funds in exchange for collateral. Asset managers like BlackRock typically act as the lending agent on their clients’ behalf. In a confidential presentation seen by Reuters, New York Federal Reserve Assistant Vice President Nicola Cetorelli told a group of international regulators in April 2014 that asset managers involved in securities lending behave like banks in many ways. “If it looks like a bank, (it) quacks like a bank,” he wrote in one slide. He added that certain practices by asset managers, such as how they may reinvest cash collateral, is “banking in its most basic form (but no equity, no bank regulation, and no backstops!).” Cetorelli has since gone on to publish an academic paper in December 2014 which contains many of the same perspectives. In its white paper, BlackRock cited Cetorelli’s December 2014 paper as one example where regulators may not fully understand how securities lending works. “Unfortunately, these concerns have formed the foundation of recent policy discussions,” BlackRock wrote in the paper. “We believe it is imperative for policy makers to have all the facts.” A New York Federal Reserve spokeswoman declined to comment. In both the confidential power point and in his public December 2014 paper, Cetorelli explicitly referred to BlackRock’s securities lending practices as an example of how asset managers may behave like banks such as JP Morgan Chase  and Citigroup. Asset managers staunchly oppose such comparisons because of their different business models. Unlike banks, they act as agents managing other peoples’ money. BlackRock and other asset managers like Fidelity and Vanguard have come under the regulatory microscope in the years since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, as regulators have grappled with ways to prevent future meltdowns.

813,BLK,UPDATE 3-McDonald's CEO gets grilled at first annual meeting,"(Adds investor comment, details from meeting) By Lisa Baertlein and Ross Kerber LOS ANGELES/BOSTON, May 21 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp  shareholders defied executives at its annual meeting on Thursday, approving a proposal to make it easier to nominate directors to the board of the fast-food chain and taking its new CEO to task over wages, advertising and its food. McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who took the helm on March 1, is fighting on numerous fronts as he works to turn around the company, which saw profit and revenue fall in 2014 after service times slowed and nimbler rivals picked off  customers with menus that appeal to growing appetites for fresher, less-processed food. Despite opposition from McDonald’s, 61 percent of voting shareholders said yes to a proposal that would make it easier for long-term investors to list director candidates on company proxy materials. The UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust brought the proxy access proposal before investors because “McDonald’s board needs to be more accountable for these performance lapses,” the Trust’s Corporate Governance Director Cambria Allen said at the meeting, which was closed to media but accessible via webcast. Thousands of protesters swarmed McDonald’s headquarters for two days of rallies that are part of a multi-year, union-supported campaign for better wages and working conditions at the world’s biggest restaurant chain. The day before the meeting, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and three other officials who are fiduciaries to large public pension funds challenged McDonald’s and other companies, saying they might be jeopardizing their own futures by returning excessive amounts of cash to investors via the buybacks. Earlier this month, Easterbrook said McDonald’s turnaround plan would include returning up to $9 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Stringer called proxy access at McDonald’s “the perfect antidote for a board whose turnaround plan prioritizes share buybacks over long-term value creation.” During Thursday’s meeting, activists asked the company to make its actions match its public message. Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jesse Sharkey called on McDonald’s to “stop pretending to support values for the public good while simultaneously undermining those policies with its political contributions.” The union introduced a shareholder proposal requesting an annual “congruency analysis” of company values and political contributions. It did not pass. While Easterbrook recently announced plans to raise pay for some 90,000 workers in company-run restaurants, Sharkey said the company “simultaneously undermines efforts to raise the minimum wage across the country with large support through the National Restaurant Association (NRA),” a deep-pocketed industry group that lobbies against such increases as well as food policy changes. “McDonald’s is exposing its share owners and business to significant reputational risks by continuing to say one thing and do another,” Sharkey said. Easterbrook told meeting attendees he was proud of the move the company made regarding crew wages in the restaurants it operates. He said the pay of some 660,000 other McDonald’s restaurant workers was up to the franchisees who employ them. He did not address the NRA contributions. Others shareholders, including three nuns, appealed to Easterbrook to take concrete steps toward serving healthier food, moving to sustainable palm oil and cutting important human antibiotics from the production of all of the meats it serves. Casey Hinds of Seattle criticized McDonald’s prior CEO Don Thompson for saying at last year’s annual meeting that McDonald’s was not marketing to schools - despite company fundraising programs such as “McTeacher’s Night.” She warned that continuing the disconnect was hurting the company’s reputation with key customers. “It’s the kind of disrespect that results in a loss of brand trust and why moms and Millennials are leaving the corporation behind,” said Hinds, a former Air Force pilot who is part of Corporate Accountability International’s Moms Not Lovin’ It network. “In every market where we do business, we are a responsible advertiser,” said Easterbrook, who added that McDonald’s and its franchisees are committed to giving back to the communities where they do business. Easterbrook, who has vowed to transform the iconic chain into a “modern, progressive burger company,” also dismissed calls to retire company mascot Ronald McDonald. “Ronald is here to stay,” he said.

814,BLK,RPT-McDonald's shareholders to weigh director-nomination rules,"(Repeats story for wider distribution, no change to text) By Lisa Baertlein and Ross Kerber LOS ANGELES/BOSTON, May 21 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp  shareholders will vote Thursday on a proposal that would make it easier to nominate directors to the board of the fast-food chain, which is in turnaround mode after losing customers and sales to competition and after internal missteps. Investor support for such new director nomination rules, referred to as “proxy access,” is growing. The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers) and the New York City Pension Funds have urged shareholders to vote for proxy access at McDonald’s, and influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Investor Services and Glass Lewis & Co have recommended that their clients support it. Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc, major investors that hold significant stakes in McDonald’s, have publicly backed proxy access. McDonald’s opposes the proposal, which was filed by the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust. “We believe that making McDonald’s leadership at the board level more accountable to shareholders ensures that the board is the strongest it can be to usher in a new chapter of prosperity for the benefit of the company, its employees, and shareholders,” said Meredith Miller, chief corporate governance officer, UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and three other officials who are fiduciaries to public pension funds with a total of $860 billion in assets are challenging McDonald’s and other companies on stock buybacks. Stringer called proxy access at McDonald’s “the perfect antidote for a board whose turnaround plan prioritizes share buybacks over long-term value creation.” The proxy access thresholds proposed at McDonald’s would allow groups of shareholders holding at least three percent of company stock for at least three years to be able to list director candidates on company proxy materials. That would give longer-term shareholders with limited resources more power to hold directors accountable, Miller said. McDonald’s encouraged shareholders to reject the proposal, which it said is “unnecessary and potentially harmful to the company at this time.” McDonald’s said it has robust corporate governance practices that provide shareholders with the ability to effectively voice their views with the board and vote on critical matters. The vote on the proposal comes shortly after activist hedge fund investors such as Jana Partners LLC and Corvex Management LP disclosed new stakes in McDonald’s. Among other things, experts said activists are unlikely to benefit from the proposal because they tend to be short-term investors.

816,BLK,UPDATE 1-Global lower rate environment harmful to investors -BlackRock CEO,"(Adds details from CEO Fink’s conference remarks) By Ashley Lau May 27 (Reuters) - Lowering interest rates around the world to boost the global economy has reached a point where it is now “quite harmful” to clients, including pension funds and insurers, BlackRock Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said on Wednesday. The “low rate environment is having a profound impact on how they’re going to operate,” Fink said at the Annual Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on Wednesday. He said that clients such as pension funds and insurance companies are “having more structural problems than ever before” in meeting their growing liability burdens without sufficiently yielding assets. New York-based BlackRock is the world’s largest money manager, with $4.8 trillion in total assets under management at the end of March. The company’s clients include a range of retail and institutional investors around the globe. Fink’s remarks echoed comments he made last month in his Chairman’s letter, in which he addressed concerns about yield-starved investors turning to lower-rated credits and longer-duration assets to attempt to meet future liabilities. “Not only is this driving prices ever higher in certain asset categories, but it is also contributing to greater portfolio concentration in more volatile areas of the market than historical norms,” he wrote. During his morning remarks at the Bernstein conference, Fink addressed a range of issues impacting the investment community and industry, from the growing need to address capital market liquidity to how technology is changing the way asset managers interact with clients. “I think the industry is going through some dramatic changes,” Fink said. “I see huge upside for our industry too, but it’s not going to be how we’re accustomed to it.”   (Reporting by Ashley Lau in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Meredith Mazzilli)",5272015,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-ceo-comments/update-1-global-lower-rate-environment-harmful-to-investors-blackrock-ceo-idUSL1N0YI0VW20150527

819,BLK,BlackRock has no interest in buying a retail brokerage: CEO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, has no intention of buying a retail brokerage firm, Larry Fink, the chief executive officer, told shareholders Thursday morning.  When asked by an investor at BlackRock’s annual shareholder meeting if it would ever consider buying a retail brokerage given the profitability of the business, Fink said “No, that’s not part of our business model.” Similarly, Fink quickly dismissed a shareholder question about whether he would serve on a board of another company anytime in the next two to three years, answering with a quick “no.” He does not serve on any other company boards.  The shareholder meeting, which lasted around 45 minutes, took place Thursday morning at the Palace Hotel in New York. While shareholders overwhelmingly approved the company’s proposals, including employee and executive compensation plans, they voted down the two shareholder proposals. One proposal, introduced by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Pension Plan and The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, requested that BlackRock publish an annual report disclosing its lobbying procedures, payments to lobbyists and trade associations. It received only 17 percent shareholder support. Another proposal, introduced by Investors against Genocide, requested that BlackRock implement an investment policy prohibiting investment in companies that engage in genocide. Specifically, the proposal, which only received three percent of the shareholder vote, noted that BlackRock is one of the largest holders of PetroChina and Sinopec, which are both large oil producers in Syria and Sudan. As such, the group claims they help fund government-sponsored genocide in both countries. BlackRock, with $4.8 trillion in assets under management, largely invests in the companies through its index funds, and is limited in what it can do, Fink told shareholders. However, BlackRock is willing to accommodate clients who want to invest in the index without those two companies, as well as work with the index providers to address the issue, Fink said. “We have had some engagement about excluding those two companies,” he said.

824,BLK,BlackRock's Rieder eyes buying more German Bunds,"(Reuters) - BlackRock’s (BLK.N) Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder is bullish on European bonds and is considering buying more German Bunds, he said in an interview on Thursday. Facing their worst week in the history of the euro, Germany’s 10-year government bonds saw yields hit eight-month highs just shy of 1 percent on Thursday, before reversing course to trade 3 basis points lower on the day at 0.83 percent. “Bunds start to get interesting at around the 1-percent level,” Rieder told Reuters.  Bill Gross, the widely followed bond investor at Janus Capital Group, tweeted on April 21 that German 10-year Bunds were “the short of a lifetime,” when they were yielding around 0.10 percent. In his June Investment Outlook, he noted that his bet against Bunds was well timed, but not well executed.  BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $4.8 trillion in assets under management, has been adding to its position in Europe and overall Rieder is bullish on the region, despite uncertainty around what will happen with Greece, he said. Greece earlier delayed a key debt payment to the International Monetary Fund due on Friday as the government demanded changes to tough terms from international creditors for aid to stave off default. “That back and forth will be on for another week or so,” Rieder said. He also dismissed the idea that the European Central Bank might end its quantitative easing program early. “While the European economy is doing reasonably well, the ECB isn’t going to end the program before September 2016,” he said. While other investors are revising their forecasts to say that the Federal Reserve may not raise rates until 2016, Rieder is sticking to September for a U.S. rate hike. “I think this Federal Reserve has shown the propensity to be patient and wait longer, but we think there is plenty of impetus for them to move,” he said.

827,BLK,"UPDATE 1-Fed's Tarullo, BlackRock's Fink cite bond market liquidity concerns","(Adds quotes from conference, background) By Michael Flaherty and Douwe Miedema NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - Financial regulators are paying close attention to liquidity concerns surfacing across the U.S. bond market, a top Federal Reserve official said on Thursday. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, the U.S. central bank’s top financial regulation official, said that while bond liquidity is a concern, the behavior of the market is not yet showing significant fluctuations in pricing. Tarullo was among several speakers at an Institute for International Finance summit who addressed the issue of a plunge in broker-dealer bond inventories and the impact this could have in times of financial stress. Prior to Tarullo, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, voiced similar worries but held a more sanguine view. “We do have a big reduction of liquidity in the bond market,” Fink said during an earlier panel at the summit, adding that such a drop should not be a surprise. Fink, who runs the world’s largest money manager, said that if the financial industry fails to move more capital market activity to transparent exchanges, the next crisis will  “probably be oriented to lack of liquidity.” “You could have the potential for frozen markets, because of no buffers,” Fink said. “I don’t think it will happen but these are the issues I worry about.” Tarullo and Fink have been joined lately by other financial regulators and industry professionals discussing bond market liquidity. Fed officials have pointed to the potential trouble set up by a surge of fixed income assets and corporate debt issuance, coupled with lower bond inventories held by banks, which could result in greater volatility, wider prices and a liquidity crunch, in the face of stress in the market. Turning from bonds to bank regulation, Tarullo said not to expect many changes to an upcoming global plan and set of rules to make financial institutions more resilient in withstanding a financial crisis. Tarullo, as the Fed’s top bank regulator, rarely speaks about monetary policy but he addressed the uncertain economic outlook on Thursday. Economic data so far in the second quarter fail to show the kind of U.S. recovery that was evident in the data last year in the same period, he said, echoing a view shared by his fellow board members. Tarullo said transitory factors contributed to the negative first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product growth reading, but that it remains to be seen if that weakness fades or persists.

Puerto Rico finance officials have said the island could run out of money by the end of September without financing. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla in May signed into law a tax bill expected to provide about $1.2 billion in revenue for the next fiscal year, allowing Puerto Rico to pursue negotiations with creditors over a much-delayed bond deal of up to $2.95 billion. BlackRock’s Peter Hayes said at a press briefing that the delay in the bond deal, originally expected late 2014, “should be concerning to investors because lack of access to the capital markets and higher borrowing costs is always an indication of greater problems.”  Puerto Rico bonds are fairly widely held by a variety of investors, he said, and a default or restructuring has the “bigger potential to upset the market.”  “It has the potential to create some uncertainty among retail and the potential for some outflows, if you get a larger broader restructuring of commonwealth in general,” Hayes said.  BlackRock does not own any bonds of power utility PREPA, which is struggling with $9 billion of debt and is currently working on a turnaround plan. But he said he could see a buying opportunity if the price fell from around 50 cents on the dollar to around 30 cents on the dollar. PREPA’s bonds maturing 2043 are trading around 53.50 cents on the dollar.  BlackRock also cited concerns about some states, particularly Illinois and Alaska, wrangling with budgets before their fiscal 2016 begins in July. Overall, BlackRock forecast that municipal bond issuance was on pace for more than $400 billion this year. Total issuance was $315 billion in 2014 according to Thomson Reuters data.

832,BLK,BlackRock to buy Mexican fund tied to scandal-hit contractor,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, has agreed to buy a Mexican infrastructure investment fund that financed projects for a contractor at the center of a scandal which embroiled President Enrique Pena Nieto. BlackRock announced its deal to buy Infraestructura Institucional, also known as I Cuadrada, on Friday, but gave no details. It will pay around 1.1 billion pesos ($71 million) and keep some of the fund’s key senior management, said a person familiar with the deal, who declined to be named as the terms were not public.     Two of the six projects listed in Infraestructura Institucional’s most recent quarterly filing were built by companies owned by contractor Juan Armando Hinojosa. Mexico’s federal auditor is investigating contracts held by Hinojosa after news of real estate deals he made with political figures sparked national outrage last year. Local media reported that he sold a luxury home in Mexico City to the first lady, and the Wall Street Journal reported that he sold a house to Finance Minister Luis Videgaray at a below-market interest rate. His companies have won millions of dollars worth of public contracts during Pena Nieto’s 2005-2011 governorship of the State of Mexico and his presidency. One of the companies was part of a Chinese-led consortium awarded a multibillion-dollar high-speed train contract last year. That contract was later nixed, days before news of the real estate deal with the first lady. The two Infraestructura Institucional projects with Hinojosa represent around 16 percent of total assets held in the fund’s two investment vehicles, including long-term accounts receivable and investments in joint ventures. When including all committed capital to the fund, it represents 9 percent of the total. BlackRock’s purchase of the fund would make it a partner with Hinojosa in one of the projects, a hospital in the State of Mexico, according to a source. “BlackRock has had a long-standing presence in Mexico; whether doing business here or anywhere else in the world, we always seek to put the appropriate controls in place,” BlackRock Latin America head Armando Senra said on Friday. He declined to answer specific questions about Grupo Higa. Executives from Infraestructura Institucional did not respond to requests for comment. Grupo Higa, contacted by Reuters, said there was no one available to comment until Monday. Founded in 2010, Infraestructura Institucional has committed 585 million pesos of convertible debt to the Zumpango Regional Hospital, a first-quarter stock exchange filing shows. It has converted 185 million pesos-worth into shares. The hospital in the State of Mexico was built by a consortium led by Constructora Teya, part of Hinojosa’s Grupo Higa, under a contract won in 2009. Hinojosa still holds a stake in the hospital, one source said.     Infraestructura Institucional also has a 600 million peso credit line with Autopistas de Vanguardia SA de CV, a Grupo Higa subsidiary, which in 2007 won a 30-year concession to build a toll road between Toluca and Naucalpan, also in the State of Mexico. Infraestructura Institucional runs two “CKDs”, special listed investment securities created in 2009 to allow Mexico’s pension funds to increase returns and diversify by investing in infrastructure. The first fund has around 3 billion pesos in committed capital. The second, with 10 billion pesos of capital committed, is larger and currently mostly invested in Mexican government debt.

834,BLK,Outflows from energy ETPs continue in May: BlackRock,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors continued to pull money from energy exchange-traded products (ETPs) in May after a rebound in oil prices stumbled as the global supply glut showed no signs of eroding. Some $540 million exited energy ETPs globally last month, following net withdrawals of $1.2 billion in April, data from asset manager BlackRock showed. Investors piled into oil ETPs in the first quarter chasing an oil price rebound. But Brent crude futures prices slipped just over 2 percent in May, and some investors decided to take profits ahead of a potentially much bigger downward correction. “The gains were getting a bit ahead of themselves given the elevated inventory levels,” said Martin Arnold, global commodity and FX strategist at ETF Securities, an issuer of ETPs. He noted that OPEC had not cut production, with Saudi Arabia raising output to a record high of around 10.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in May.  Meanwhile, demand has failed to pick up enough to work through the millions of barrels of oil in storage on land and at sea.  “We think there is some near-term weakness to come in oil prices - there is a greater risk of downside at the moment, so the profit-taking is pretty pragmatic,” said Arnold. The data also showed investors beginning to tilt back toward industrial metals and broad basket commodity ETPs, which attracted net inflows of $163 million and $430 million respectively in May. Arnold said that ETF Securities had seen strong inflows into its aluminum and broad basket industrial metals ETPs, but copper products had experienced outflows.  In terms of price performance, industrial metals was the worst-performing sector in the S&P; GSCI in May, dropping 7.9 percent, and aluminum was the worst-performing commodity, sliding 11 percent.  This suggests tactical investors are targeting metals that look oversold and where fundamentals are becoming more supportive. “The risks to supply offer a decent buying opportunity - virtually across the sector you are seeing inventories fall,” Arnold said. Agriculture ETPs attracted a net $143 million, their strongest performance for over a year. Arnold said softs such as coffee and sugar had seen some decent inflows.  He linked this to a number of weather-related factors, such as the potential for frost damage sparking fears of a lower coffee harvest in Brazil. He also cited reports of potential damage to the winter wheat crop and an ongoing El Nino effect, which is likely to reduce yields year-on-year.

837,BLK,CORRECTED-Blackstone (not Blackrock) to list Spanish rent-controlled housing unit,"(Corrects throughout to show company is Blackstone, a private equity group, not BlackRock, an asset manager) MADRID, June 24 (Reuters) - Fidere Patrimonio, a real estate investment trust owned by private equity group Blackstone  that groups units of rent-controlled housing in Madrid and Barcelona, will list its shares on Spain’s alternative stock market MAB next week, the bourse said on Wednesday. City and regional governments sold thousands of rent-controlled flats - subsidized to make them affordable to lower- income families - to private investors during Spain’s economic crisis, causing huge controversy. Thousands of Spain’s poor now depend for their homes on the generosity of private equity. The announcement of the listing by Blackstone comes only days after Madrid city council changed hands. Under leftist Mayoress Manuela Carmena, it has vowed to reverse the tide of housing evictions during the economic crisis. Carmena, a former judge, also said she would review whether the sale of property was lawful. She plans to set up an office to act as intermediary between banks and families threatened with eviction. Fidere, which owns 2,688 properties in Madrid and Barcelona with a value of 212 million euros, said the listing seeks to provide potential liquidity and transparency. But documents filed by Fidere to the bourse spoke of a reputational risk as rent-controlled housing changes to private from public management. The documents also said tenants will be required to show they are solvent by presenting their most recent wage statements and providing proof that rents are no higher than 40 percent of their income, as well as not being on any creditor blacklist. Amnesty International released a report earlier this week which said that almost 600,000 eviction proceedings had begun in Spain since 2008. Just 1 percent of housing on offer is subsidized as part of housing programmes, Amnesty said, compared with 32 percent in the Netherlands, 23 percent in Austria and 18 percent in the United Kingdom.

839,BLK,RPT - INSIGHT-Banks slash payments to index funds for Russell rebalance,"(Repeats for additional subscribers) By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - With the annual rebalance of the Russell stock indexes just a day away, brokerage firms are shaving the discounts they typically offer to big index funds on what is usually one of the biggest trading days of the year. On Friday, Russell will announce the names of some 128 companies that it is adding to its widely-followed Russell 2000 index of small companies. And that’s when the big index fund providers - including Vanguard Group, Dimensional Fund Advisors and BlackRock Inc - must adjust their portfolios by buying the new stocks and selling the old. As recently as three years ago, big brokerages such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs would vie for those orders, confident that they could hand the big fund companies discounts of around .05 percent off of market-priced trades and still make money, mainly by stockpiling the right stocks in advance of the big trade. But in recent years, that has become harder to do. With FTSE Russell disclosing probable additions and deletions in advance, as well as increased competition from other institutional and retail investors, brokers have not found reconstitution day delivering the easy money it once did. Now, most brokers are offering the index funds closer to .01 percent to .02 percent, current and former executives at brokerage firms and index fund providers told Reuters. All of the executives wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. “The brokers are finding it is not as lucrative as it once was,” said one index fund manager. There is big money involved. Roughly $835 billion is invested in index funds that track the Russell indices, Russell said. More than $50 billion is expected to change hands in the final moments of Friday, according to New York-based Investment Technology Group. For example, at BlackRock alone, $41.9 billion in funds track the Russell 2000 index. With about 10.7 percent of those indexes expected to turn over, brokers would pay between $450,000 and $900,000 for the privilege of doing those rebalancing trades - and more to trade for the BlackRock institutional portfolios that also track those indexes. In the era of 0.05 percent discounts, brokers might have paid $2.2 million or more to BlackRock to handle the same volume Brokerage firms typically start buying shares of the companies that will be added to the Russell indices earlier in the year in anticipation of being able to sell them at a profit on the rebalance day. That was a more lucrative strategy when it was harder to figure out which companies would be added. Trading off the rebalance months ahead of time is so popular that Charles Schwab Corp has even promoted the strategy to its retail investors. “If you’re a short-term trader, you might want to take advantage of the Russell reconstitution by buying some of the possible additions around the end of March and selling them near the end of June,” Schwab wrote in a March 2014 paper promoting its equity rating service. A Schwab spokeswoman declined to comment. As a result, these shares are popping months before the reconstitution and then losing ground on the big day. For example, Reuters analyzed the price performance of the 10 companies that saw the biggest volume boost on the day of the 2014 rebalance. Those shares rose 8.3 percent in the three months leading up to the rebalance, while the Russell 2000 Index rose 2.2 percent. On the day of the rebalance, they fell 3.9 percent, while the Russell 2000 rose 0.7 percent. They slipped another 10.3 percent in the subsequent three months, while the broader index lost 5.9 percent. FTSE Russell has made several changes to its methodology over the past several years and made the process more transparent to reduce the volatility in these stocks on the day of the rebalance, said Rolf Agather, managing director, research and innovation indexes at FTSE Russell. Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Vanguard and Dimensional Fund Advisors declined to comment. Calls to Bank of America were not returned. Another reason brokers connected to big banks are less likely to offer the aggressive price improvements they once did is the new post-financial crisis regulations requiring banks to keep more capital on hand, executives said. “A lot of firms are reluctant to put their balance sheet out these days,” said one of the brokerage executives, explaining that by buying up the positions in anticipation of the rebalance, they are essentially increasing the amount of risk on their books. For brokerages, the desire to win the index fund business while managing risk puts them in a difficult spot. On one hand, they want to offer competitive pricing, but on the other, they need to manage their own risk. “Firms understand this business is a loss leader but the hope is the relationship grows and the broker does other business with those managers,” said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York. For example, large index funds can pass on brokerages business from their institutional clients, which is highly lucrative, said one of the executives who works at a large Wall Street bank. That makes it difficult for firms to stop offering these discounts altogether. “The index funds have a lot of power right now,” said one former brokerage executive.

843,BLK,"Amid inflows, BlackRock to expand currency-hedged ETF lineup","BOSTON, July 1 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc plans to add 11 new funds to its lineup of iShares currency-hedged ETFs, executives said, amid growing demand for the products. Jane Leung, a BlackRock managing director who oversees the sector, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that BlackRock’s five existing currency-hedged ETFs have about $7.4 billion in assets. About $6.6 billion of the total has come in over the past year. Leung said the inflow shows that investors are paying more attention to the impact of changes in the relative value of currencies, such as the rapid rise in value of the U.S. dollar through the spring. “Investors have to look at currency more closely than ever,” she said. Other sponsors of currency-hedged ETFs have also reported strong inflows over the past year, according to figures from the Lipper unit of Thomson Reuters, including those offered by WisdomTree Investments and by a unit of Deutsche Bank. BlackRock’s new ETFs will include eight focused on specific countries, including Australia, Mexico and Spain, plus three that invest globally or outside the United States and Canada. They will invest in unhedged iShares ETFs and use contracts to reduce currency risk. The hedged ETFs are more expensive for investors. The current iShares MSCI Australia ETF has an expense ratio of 0.48 percent, while the currency-hedged version will charge 0.51 percent, Leung said.

844,BLK,BlackRock's Koesterich says expects Greeks to approve referendum,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Greek voters will likely approve a bailout offer from creditors in a referendum set for Sunday, said a top strategist for BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager. In a telephone interview on Thursday, Russ Koesterich, BlackRock global chief investment strategist, said he expected “some type of knee-jerk relief rally” as a result of the referendum even though markets have already priced in anticipation by most investors of a “yes” vote on the bailout. Based on polling, Koesterich said: “The vast majority of Greeks still want to be in the euro. Clearly a ‘no’ vote puts that membership in peril.” Greek voters are being asked to decide on Sunday whether to accept bailout terms from creditors, provoking a tumultuous domestic debate. Koesterich’s expectations are in line with those of other U.S. investors, though recent polling makes the result hard to forecast. Koesterich warned that the political environment was still fluid and that the odds could still change before Sunday. A “no” vote on the ballot question, he said, could lead to the sale of risky assets, similar to what occurred on Monday, when U.S. stocks fell around 2 percent and some European indexes were down more. Still, Koesterich said he believed the market impact of Greece’s exit from the euro, if it happens, would be limited. “I think it would be a temporary event,” he said. BlackRock has advised Greek officials in the past. A BlackRock spokeswoman said the company would not comment on advisory relationships. New York-based BlackRock has $4.8 trillion under management but data from the Lipper unit of Thomson Reuters show a scant $200 million or so of BlackRock stock and bond holdings in Greece. Asked about U.S. equities, Koesterich called U.S. stock valuations “somewhere between fairly valued and a bit stretched.” A correction of as much as 5 or 10 percent could occur once the U.S. Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates, he said, and longer-term equities gains should be more modest than in recent years.  “Valuations are elevated, relative to history. But you have a benign environment of low rates, low inflation and a decent credit market. Given those conditions, equities can go higher,” he said. A correction could be a chance to buy technology and financial companies that would benefit from a stronger economy, he said.

847,BLK,BlackRock proposes reforms to address bond liquidity concerns,"July 10 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc is calling for a series of reforms that both regulators and asset managers should consider to address concerns about liquidity in the fixed income market. In a paper released on Friday, the world’s largest asset manager discussed how new trading protocols for fixed income securities, revised reporting of large block trades and best practices among asset managers among other things could address concerns about higher costs and lower trading volume in different fixed income sectors. Tougher regulation in the wake of the financial crisis has reduced the willingness of bond dealers to take on large blocks of bonds from customers. As a result, government bonds around the world have become harder to buy and sell, according to a Barclays report released on Wednesday. The release of BlackRock’s paper comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to tighten its supervision of what procedures asset managers have in place to deal with a race to the exits in the fixed income markets. Meanwhile, the Financial Stability Oversight Board, which has been looking into whether asset managers such as BlackRock pose systemic risk, shifted gears last year in its review of the industry, focusing more on asset management activities and products, instead of the big firms themselves. In its paper, BlackRock proposes creating a new trading protocol for fixed income securities that would be closer to how equities trade with buy and sell orders being matched up. Such a protocol is currently being used through a joint venture between BlackRock and MarketAxess Holdings and has seen growing adoption, said Richie Prager, head of trading and liquidity strategies at BlackRock, in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. Also, delaying the disclosure of large block trades of fixed income securities to the end of day or lowering the minimum threshold when they need to be disclosed could prevent market reaction to these trades, BlackRock said in the paper. All block trades above $5 million currently are disclosed immediately. “Folks are currently afraid to take risk because everyone will know it happened,” Prager said. BlackRock also suggested best practices that asset managers can adopt, including allowing temporary borrowing for short-term purposes and implementing mechanisms where redeeming shareholders would pay the price for liquidity during times of stress. In a separate paper, BlackRock addressed concerns about liquidity of bond exchange-traded funds, noting that a classification system that differentiated between traditional ETFs from exchange-traded notes and ETFs that invest in commodities could help investors better understand the risks.

848,BLK,BlackRock unconstrained bond fund posts $1.7 billion second-quarter inflow,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) unconstrained bond fund, its $31 billion Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BASIX.O), posted second quarter inflows of $1.7 billion, more than half of the $3.1 billion the firm’s U.S. mutual funds brought in for that period, Morningstar data showed on Monday.  Meanwhile, unconstrained bond funds overall saw $1.9 billion in outflows over the same period, according to Morningstar. Unconstrained bond funds have become popular over the last year because they have the flexibility to invest in all types of bond securities globally and often choose credit rather than interest-rate sensitive assets. BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund’s three- and five-year returns rank the fund among the top quartile of its peers, but this year, the performance has leveled.  So far this year, the fund has returned 0.69 percent, which is slightly below its category average, according to Morningstar.  “It’s not a huge surprise that they saw big inflows since the fund has a great track record, a seasoned team and it is one of the high priority funds at BlackRock in terms of sales and distribution,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of exchange traded fund and mutual fund research at S&P; Capital IQ.  “The question is why are people pulling money out of unconstrained bond funds as a category at a time when you would think they would want them,” he added, referring to an expected U.S. rate hike later this year which could boost uncertainty for bonds, thus making flexible funds more appealing. BlackRock has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of outflows from bond manager Pacific Investment Management Co following the sudden resignation of its co-founder and star manager Bill Gross. Investors have pulled more than $54.6 billion from Pimco funds in the second quarter, according to Morningstar data. A Pimco spokeswoman declined to comment. A BlackRock spokeswoman also declined to comment, citing the firm’s quiet period before earnings, which are scheduled to be released Wednesday.  Overall investors poured $4.2 billion into BlackRock’s fixed-income funds during the second quarter. The firm’s equity funds, which it is trying to revive, saw $1 billion in outflows during the quarter, according to Morningstar.     Since 2012, BlackRock has replaced five of its nine U.S. equity teams.  Meanwhile, investors poured $14.7 billion into BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds during the quarter. The firm’s iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA.P) brought in the most new money of all of its ETFs in the quarter at $4.2 billion, according to Morningstar.

852,BLK,"Carl Icahn calls BlackRock a 'dangerous' company, cites ETF concerns","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn on Wednesday lambasted BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, as an “extremely dangerous company” because of the prevalence of its exchange-traded fund products, which Icahn deems illiquid. “They sell liquidity,” Icahn said in reference to BlackRock’s ETF business. “There is no liquidity. That’s my point. And that’s what’s going to blow this up.” Icahn was speaking at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference in New York, sharing the stage with Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock. Icahn said he was concerned about the amount of money invested in high-yield ETFs, which he called “overpriced.” Icahn said that when the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates, investors would likely sell their high-yield ETFs, and that he feared the consequences of such a sell-off since he said there would be nobody to buy them. Icahn has previously said he believes the high-yield bond market was in a bubble. Fink countered that Icahn’s characterizations of ETFs were “dead wrong” and that the index funds were just “a tool for buying exposure.” Fink also said that ETFs “create more price transparency than anything in the bond market today,” especially in high-yield.  The U.S. ETF market has roughly $2.1 trillion in assets, according to ETF.com.  Fink also said higher interest rates would result in more money flowing into the bond market. He reiterated that the Fed would likely raise rates in September and that normalization of the Fed’s funds rates would be good for the economy.  On activist investors, Fink said: “there are good ones and there are some bad ones.” Fink said BlackRock would continue to be in “deep dialogue” with companies the firm has issues with.  Earlier this year, Fink urged the top executives of the 500 largest publicly listed U.S. companies to take a long-term approach to create value for shareholders or risk losing his firm’s support. In a letter to the chief executive officers of the S&P; 500 index dated March 31, Fink asked the companies to avoid short-term pressures created by the increasing activist shareholder activity of recent years. Fink repeated that sentiment Wednesday and said: “There is a growing network of activists who have now focused on more short-term proxy harassment ... they’re in for one or two years.” He also said that he was “deeply worried” about excessive share repurchases on behalf of companies, instead of companies growing capital investment, research and development, and hiring.  In 2014, dividends and buybacks in the United States totaled $900 billion, the highest ever, according to Fink’s letter.

855,BLK,BlackRock profit rises as firm sees first outflows since 2012,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, posted a small rise in second-quarter profit as the company saw net outflows for the first time in nearly three years. Net outflows totaled $36.6 billion, with investors pulling out $7.3 billion from BlackRock’s long-term funds. It is the first time that the New York-based firm has posted outflows since the third quarter of 2012. The bulk of those outflows were from large international institutional investors pulling funds from low-fee index-based products. CEO Larry Fink told Reuters in an interview that those investors put the money into cash or reallocated into active BlackRock strategies. Ten of BlackRock’s largest institutional clients have pulled $40 billion from BlackRock over the past two quarters, he said. “It’s raining in some parts of the world and some of these countries have built large rainy day funds,” Fink said.  But many of these same investors reallocated into BlackRock’s more profitable active strategies, according to the firm. BlackRock saw $2.5 billion in net inflows into its institutional active strategies. Overall, investors poured $10.85 billion into BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds, with the lion’s share going into equity funds.  Retail flows totaled $10.8 billion, the bulk into fixed income funds. The inflows into active strategies and ETFs are key to BlackRock because they garner higher fees than institutional index strategies.  For every $10,000, an investor in a BlackRock retail fund pays around $64 a year, compared with $34 for an exchange-traded fund and $10 for institutional clients, according to the firm. “If you think about what our ambitions were three years ago, we wanted to be known as much as an active manager as an index manager,” Fink told Reuters Wednesday morning. “We have certainly proven that in fixed income, we have proven it in multi-asset, and we are proving it in our model-based active funds.” However, BlackRock still has a ways to go in gaining market share among registered investment advisers (RIAs), Fink said on an analyst call Wednesday. “We are still way behind other firms with regard to the RIAs,” he said.  BlackRock is looking at how it can bring some if its risk management tools, like its Aladdin platform, to this audience, Fink said. And despite BlackRock’s sweet spot in fixed income, Fink said he is not worried that investors will rush out of bonds if the Federal Reserve raises rates later this year. “Seventy percent of BlackRock’s bond holders are insurance companies and pension funds,” Fink said, noting that these institutions have long time horizons. “People don’t leave fixed income... it’s one of those myths.” BlackRock reported that third quarter profit rose to $819 million, or $4.84 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, up from $808 million, or $4.72 per share, a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, BlackRock earned $4.96 per share, handily beating analysts’ average estimate of $4.80, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

859,BLK,U.S. fund industry weighs proposed Clinton tax increase,"NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Fund companies and brokerage firms should be able to weather a proposal by Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that would increase capital gains taxes for some investors, but some fund holders could see higher costs, managers and analysts said. Though details of Clinton’s plan have yet to be finalized, the candidate’s proposal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, would increase the holding period required to qualify for lower long-term rates. Currently, gains on investments held for less than a year are taxed at ordinary income tax rates, while those held for longer than a year are taxed at a maximum rate of 23.8 percent for the highest earners. Brokerage firms that rely on customer trading as a revenue source might see a “modest” impact to their bottom lines should Clinton’s proposal become law, said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill who covers the brokerage industry. The plan may “slightly” reduce the number of trades by customers at brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab Corp , TD Ameritrade Holding Corp and E*Trade Financial Corp, he said. But about 75 percent of the daily volume comes from active traders who are already subject to higher taxes because of their frequent trading, and therefore would be unaffected by the higher rates, he noted. Portfolio managers would have a harder job trying to avoid triggering capital gains taxes that would be passed on to investors, fund analysts said. The average large-cap blend fund has an annual turnover of 70 percent, likely incurring a mix of short-term and long-term capital gains taxes for its shareholders each year, according to Lipper data. Most actively managed funds also tend to charge a redemption fee on shares held for less than a year in order to limit short-term trading by their customers. The change would mean Clinton’s plan could hit fund investors with more frequent capital gains taxes, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P; CapitalIQ. Actively managed funds spread their own capital gains across all investors in the fund. “This will impact mutual fund investors even if they have a long-term investment horizon because capital gains will now have to hit a different threshold. You could find yourself paying taxes at a higher rate even if you didn’t do anything during that year,” Rosenbluth said. However, Brad Friedlander, managing partner of Angel Oak Capital Advisors in Atlanta, said higher rates would likely have a minimal impact on firms such as T. Rowe Price Group Inc  and BlackRock Inc because most portfolio managers and shareholders tend to hold their stakes for several years. Financial planners may see a windfall from any changes that complicate the tax structure, said Phil Orlando, a portfolio manager with Federated Investors in New York. “It becomes a cat-and-mouse game as individuals sit down and try to figure out which vehicles they have at their disposal that are not subject to taxes,” such as IRA accounts or 529 college savings accounts, he said.

860,BLK,BlackRock steps up China drive with new license to raise onshore funds,"BANGKOK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. fund giant BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) has won a special new licence that will allow it to raise funds in China directly for the first time, a senior executive told Reuters, paving the way for the world’s largest money manager to expand in the mainland.  Speaking in an interview in Bangkok this week, BlackRock vice chairman Philipp Hildebrand, said his company was granted a so-called Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership (QDLP) license “reasonably recently”. He said BlackRock, with about $4.5 trillion in assets, is committed to China and will “do whatever that entails” to provide asset management services there. At a time when China’s stock markets are gingerly recovering from their worst ever sell-off, the new licence allows BlackRock, which already has some operations in the country, greater freedom to raise funds onshore from domestic high net worth Chinese investors through a wholly owned fund management company. BlackRock now joins a handful of other global funds with QDLP licenses including, Man Group Plc (EMG.L) and Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZM.N). Amid Beijing’s extraordinary measures to halt its markets slide, some questioned the second-largest economy in the world’s commitment to opening up capital markets. Although the Chinese authorities do not publish information on QDLP licenses, BlackRock is among the first traditional asset managers to receive such a license, according to people familiar with the matter. Hildebrand declined to discuss targets for BlackRock’s business in China. “We also recognize that it’s a long-term proposition and we’re ready to stay for the duration,” said Hildebrand. “I think we’ve shown to the authorities and to the market that we’re there.” Beijing controls access to its market tightly. Foreign asset managers that wish to distribute investment products generally have to operate on the ground through minority-owned joint ventures with domestic firms, although regulators are gradually loosening the reins. Hildebrand, who was in the Thai capital to address a Bank of Thailand policy forum, said he was not concerned by short-term volatility, but by whether China remains committed to its reform agenda. “It will have repercussions, it will mean lower growth rates but I think the Chinese government knows that and accepts that as the natural consequence of this desirable reform effort,” he added, referring to China’s reform efforts. BlackRock was awarded two Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) licenses last year, which allows the company to purchase stocks and bonds in China. It also has a stake in a joint venture with Bank of China Investment Management.  Unveiled in 2012, the QDLP licence is designed to allow foreign alternative asset managers, namely hedge funds, to raise funds onshore to invest offshore. The first round of licenses was granted in 2013. “This is a very significant development for BlackRock from a branding and marketing perspective, as it allows them to raise funds in China in their own name directly for the first time,” said Stephen Baron, executive director at Shanghai-based investment consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.  “It also very important for the scheme itself, as it signals that the authorities are broadening out QDLP.” ",7212015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-china/blackrock-steps-up-china-drive-with-new-license-to-raise-onshore-funds-idUSKCN0PV10320150721
861,BLK,BlackRock dives into private deals as banks shy away,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is on the prowl for energy and infrastructure projects in the United States, Mexico and Asia that its institutional clients can invest in, Mark McCombe, head of BlackRock’s institutional business, said in an interview last week. The asset manager, the world’s largest, is trying to build a name for itself in private financing deals to attract and please yield-hungry clients such as U.S. pension funds, McCombe said. He sees particular opportunity now because banks that had funded those types of projects are constrained from doing so by post-crisis regulations. Historically, BlackRock has invested in such deals through its fund of funds business, but direct deals give the company  more flexibility in the kinds of projects it can invest in, rather than having to stick to the mandate of a fund, McCombe said. BlackRock is interested in bringing private equity ownership deals and private lending deals to clients.  “We are doing more direct deals so it means our name is going to be more prominent and hopefully people will see the name and approach us with more deals,” said McCombe, 49, who is rumored by insiders to be one of a handful of contenders to lead the BlackRock when Chief Executive Larry Fink, 62, retires. Last week, Halliburton (HAL.N) said it had tapped BlackRock for $500 million to help fund drilling in existing shale wells.  Earlier this year, BlackRock and private equity firm First Reserve took a joint equity stake in a $900 million pipeline project run by state-controlled Mexican oil company Pemex. BlackRock also is looking for more deals in asset management technology, such as its investment in Symphony Communications Services Holding LLC, a Wall Street-backed digital marketplace for research and data.. Over the past two and half years, BlackRock said, it has raised $15.2 billion in commitments for such deals either directly or through its fund of funds business. The company  declined to break out how much is in funds or invested directly.  These deals are a small part of BlackRock’s alternatives business, which accounted for just 3 percent of the firm’s assets under management, while generating 6.4 percent of the company’s total revenue. “We love energy and we love anything that has the characteristics of becoming too expensive for the banks to warehouse,” McCombe said.

864,BLK,Situs hires BlackRock exec for commercial property risk analysis,"NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Situs, a rapidly expanding commercial real estate advisory firm, said on Tuesday it hired Warren Friend, a securitization expert who was BlackRock’s point man for its advise to governments on commercial real estate valuations during the financial crisis. Friend will lead product strategy and strategic client development at Situs, the most senior of some 50 people the Houston-based company with a headcount of almost 700 has hired over the past two months, the company said. Steve Powel, chief executive of Situs, said Friend will initially focus on risk mitigation as he works with the company’s financial institutions group, which deals with banks on stress testing as part of the Federal Reserve’s annual comprehensive capital analysis and review. Powel called Friend an innovative thinker who is working on “game-changing technology” that will address the fragmented commercial real estate marketplace. Situs declined further comment. Friend said real estate is experiencing tremendous growth as an alternative asset class and that as part of the company’s leadership, he has the opportunity to build the best service provider in the industry. “It’s one thing to work institutionally, you’re kind of safe there,” said Friend, who also previously worked at Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. “I reached that point in a career where you can go for it. I get to use all the knowledge that 30 years gives you.” At BlackRock, Warren was head of the commercial real estate group within the firm’s financial markets advisory division, which was a prime conduit for advising U.S. and foreign banks about asset valuations throughout the financial crisis. Situs was acquired in January by Stone Point Capital LLC, a private equity firm run by two former senior partners at Goldman Sachs & Co.

868,BLK,CORRECTED-Got China? Two big emerging market ETFs diverge on their exposure,"(Corrects FTSE Russell name in paragraph 8 and corrects that its indexes adding China stocks are new transitional indexes) By Tariro Mzezewa NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The two leading exchange-traded funds focusing on emerging markets have very different exposure to now-vulnerable Chinese stocks and will probably diverge further, a new analysis by S&P; Capital IQ shows. The Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets Stock Index ETF  recently had 28 percent of its assets invested in China, while Blackrock Inc’s iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  had 24 percent, even though both are index-following broad emerging markets funds. Chinese stocks fell 6 percent on Tuesday, and further weakness in both that market and China’s economy could play out very differently in these two funds. “Based on the names and country profiles, it should seem they are offering you the same exposure, but they track different indices,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research at S&P; Capital IQ. “Their country exposure is going to be different, and that exposure difference helps explain why they perform differently. So far, the discrepancy has helped the Vanguard fund, Rosenbluth said, although both funds have taken a hit since the end of June, when the Shanghai Composite Index started falling. Since then, the Vanguard fund has lost 11.65 percent, while the iShares fund has fallen 12.45 percent. Year to date, the Vanguard fund is down 6.97 percent, and the iShares fund is down 8.89 percent. Chinese shares have been falling on fears that the nation’s economy may slow well beyond the 7 percent growth rate that analysts had earlier suggested would be a bottom for that market. China has moved to weaken its currency to bolster its economy and share prices. The difference between the two funds is expected to widen because the two different indexes they follow will be treating Chinese stocks differently. FTSE Russell plans to begin adding onshore Chinese equities, known as A-shares, to new transitional emerging markets indexes, which it expects Vanguard to start following. The existing Vanguard benchmark, the FTSE Emerging Index, now has approximately 26 percent exposure to China, according to the mutual fund company. In June, Vanguard said it would begin shifting to the new FTSE index later this year. The new index will have a 29 percent exposure to China, including a 5.6 percent exposure to A-shares. MSCI Inc, however, said in June that it was not ready to include the A-shares in its two emerging market indexes. “The Vanguard fund’s performance will be driven by how well the Chinese stocks do,” said Rosenbluth. A-shares are traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and are typically only available to local investors and select qualified foreign investors. Most foreign investors trade H-shares. These shares of companies incorporated in mainland China are listed on the Hong Kong exchange.

870,BLK,Market turmoil threatens Fed's rate hike plans,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Turmoil in world financial markets and growing fears of a China-led global economic slowdown threaten to derail the Federal Reserve’s plans to start raising rates from near zero, making the chances of a September lift-off look increasingly remote. A near 9-percent dive in Chinese shares on Monday triggered sharp sell-offs in Asia and Europe, wild swings and losses on Wall Street, and knocked crude prices to new multi-year lows. The rout, which follows weeks of jitters over the extent of China’s economic troubles and their impact on the rest of the world, convinced investors that the Fed would hold off with action until some semblance of calm returns. “You would be insane to raise interest rates when markets are in such turmoil,” said Martin Barnes, chief economist at BCA Research in Montreal. Compared to last week, investors now see a much lower chance the Fed will hike at its Sept. 16-17 meeting. Prices for swaps on Wall Street implied traders saw a 24 percent probability for a September move, down from 46 percent a week earlier, according to Tullett Prebon data. Barclays, for example, now expects the Fed will not raise rates until March. Previously, the British bank expected the hike to come in September. BlackRock Inc’s chief investment officer for fixed income, Rick Rieder, told Reuters that even though he hoped the Fed would move next month, market volatility was making it difficult. As part of Monday’s sell-off, investors also scaled back their own bets on long-term U.S. inflation. The market gauge of those expectations - the yield spread between 10-year Treasuries and 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities - hit a seven-month low, suggesting investors see inflation of around 1.5 percent over the next decade, well below the Fed’s 2 percent target. Until quite recently, the Fed has expressed limited concern over China’s market turbulence, with policy debate focusing on evidence of improving labor markets and solid economic activity and whether it should raise rates next month or in December and at what pace it should proceed afterwards. With market jitters hitting home, however, the Fed has a number of reasons to be cautions even about taking that first step. One is that financial markets, with investors shying away from risk and pushing U.S. Treasury yields lower, are more prone to a nervous reaction if the Fed were to move next month. Secondly, the Fed has to consider that market gloom might be a sign that the global economy is in worse shape than it has  assumed, and the drag on the U.S. economy could be bigger than previously factored in by the central bank. Fed policymakers have also said they wanted to be confident that inflation will start climbing towards its target before embarking on a tightening cycle and that goal now looks even more elusive. As a result of global demand worries oil prices tumbled by another 5 percent to new 6-1/2 lows. China’s weakness and softer global demand for anything from raw materials to electronic components and heavy machinery is also bad news for U.S. factories. Even though China accounts for only a small share of U.S. exports, several Fed policymakers noted last month that “a material slowdown in Chinese economic activity could pose risks to the U.S. economic outlook,” according to the minutes of their July 28-29 policy meeting. “The export effect is certainly significant,” said Charles Collyns, an economist at the Institute for International Finance who also sees the U.S. central bank staying pat in September. “The Fed is going to play it very cool.” Troubles abroad, such as euro zone’s debt crisis, have repeatedly stunted the United States’ recovery from the 2007-2009 recession, but policymakers of late have been more confident the U.S. economy can cope with headwinds from abroad. The Fed has carefully crafted a message this year that the time was approaching for it to raise interest rates. A September hike is not entirely off the table. The U.S. stock market rout that began Friday could still reverse itself, and a key employment report for August might show further improvement in the labor market. “It’s only August, and markets move quickly,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase. But he added: “The moves we’ve seen in markets, if they are sustained, don’t help the case for September.”   (Reporting by Jason Lange in Washington and Jonathan Spicer in New York; Additional reporting by Richard Leong in New York and Krista Hughes in Washington; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)",8242015,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-global-fed/market-turmoil-threatens-feds-rate-hike-plans-idUSL1N10Z17Z20150824
871,BLK,BlackRock to acquire robo-adviser,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager is acquiring a San Francisco-based robo-adviser, FutureAdvisor, the firm announced Wednesday morning. Unlike competitors in this space, BlackRock does not plan to target individual investors with the robo-adviser, which offers portfolio management online.   Instead the firm hopes to use FutureAdvisor to enable banks, brokerage firms, insurers and 401(k) plans to use the company’s digital platform to serve mass affluent investors and millennials, Frank Porcelli, head of BlackRock’s U.S. wealth advisory unit, said in an interview. Many banks and brokerage firms over the years have shifted their focus to serve higher net worth investors, leaving an opportunity for firms to target the “mass affluent” investors, or those with less than $1 million in investable assets, Porcelli said. Younger investors are increasingly interested in online advice, as opposed to hiring an adviser, he said. By using FutureAdvisor, financial institutions can either offer these clients a digital advice offering or they can use the offering to complement a broker. Also, the FutureAdvisor platform enables clients to aggregate all of their accounts, which is often a challenge for financial advisers, said Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer and global head of BlackRock Solutions. “You have a 401(k), then a bank account, and then maybe one or two brokerage accounts and figuring all of that out as well as the tax components is something that FutureAdvisor is strong at,” Goldstein said. Through the acquisition, FutureAdvisor will keep its brand and be part of BlackRock Solutions, the firm’s risk management and technology platform. BlackRock, which has $4.7 trillion in assets under management, has been increasingly focused on technology. The firm has been hiring to grow its “big data” team and recently hired a data scientist from Google. Speaking at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York in May, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he believed robo-advisers were going to become an element that every major firm would need to offer. “Everyone talks about how robo-advisers can’t connect with clients,” Fink said. “I actually believe those kinds of tools are like an ATM machine. We are all going to have to have it.” Terms of the acquisition, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, were not disclosed. BlackRock said the financial impact of the transaction would not be material to the firm’s earnings per share.

878,BLK,BlackRock sees new opportunity in China real estate,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc is ready to increase its China real estate portfolio exposure as it sees good entry points following the weakness in the nation’s economy and credit environment, a senior executive of the U.S. money manager said on Monday. John Saunders, Head of Asia-Pacific Real Estate at BlackRock, told Reuters the fund would target mass-affluent shopping malls and grade “A” and “B” offices in China’s first- tier and selective second-tier cities for investments. “We see the current malaise as a good entry point that we believe will throw up some good opportunities,” Saunders said in an interview at his office in Hong Kong’s central business district. New York-based BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, oversees about $8 billion in property investments in Asia.  “For a period in time we didn’t do a lot in China, because the pricing didn’t seem conducive for us to make returns, whilst underwriting reasonable levels of growth. Now that picture has changed and China has become our key market for sure. It has been softening for the past 18 to 24 months,” Saunders added. Yields in Chinese retail real estate investment markets have compressed to around 6 percent in the first half of this year due to expensive land cost and excess supply, according to property consultancy Colliers. They were about 9 percent a decade ago.  But yields are holding up relatively well for them even as capital values have weakened, Saunders said. BlackRock said it owns a shopping mall in the southwestern city of Chengdu. Saunders, who joined from Singapore-based property investment firm MGPA when it was acquired by BlackRock in 2013, also saw opportunities in distressed residential projects in the mainland.     China, the world’s second largest economy, is forecast to grow at its slowest pace in 25 years hurt by soft demand, over-capacity and falling investment. It has been further buffeted by a recent stock market slide and surprise yuan devaluation. Currency depreciation, in fact, can make real estate investment favorable, if a firm hedges its currency exposure early, he said. “When a currency depreciates, hard assets tend to appreciate, because people take flight from paper currency deprecation into hard asset.” Other than China, Saunders said he is also upbeat on Japan, and Australia in the near term, adding that Hong Kong appeared “pricey”.

Hallac, who was the first employee to join BlackRock in 1988, was formerly chief operating officer and the initial architect for the firm’s Aladdin risk management system, which now has 20,000 users with around $15 trillion in assets tied to it, according to the firm. He also founded the firm’s BlackRock Solutions service, which provides Aladdin and other advisory services to financial institutions. “Charlie was not only my partner for many years, but also a trusted and valued friend. He was a visionary who embodied our culture and was truly the heart and soul of BlackRock,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in the statement. “His extraordinary innovations, including our unique Aladdin platform, have been central to our success, but his most important legacy is the generation of leaders molded by Charlie’s tremendous ability to lead and mentor.” Hallac became co-president in 2014, a role he shared with Robert Kapito, following a reorganization among its executive ranks. Known for his in-depth understanding of the operational needs of the business, Hallac was in the office everyday even when he was undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. Before his diagnosis with colon cancer in 2012, Hallac was long thought to be a possible successor to Larry Fink, according to former BlackRock executives who wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. BlackRock’s reorganization in 2014 was part of an effort to groom other senior executives to be possible successors for Fink, the sources said. Hallac is survived by his wife Sarah and three children, David, Rebecca and AJ.

Even before the country opened up the market on June 15, BlackRock was hearing interest from clients, particularly U.S. pensions funds, foundations and endowments, he said. However, it is very difficult for institutional investors to access it because they need to register as a qualified foreign investor, which can be a lengthy process. For example, BlackRock has been working to get its registration since early this year, Gamba said.

885,BLK,Fed likely to raise rates in December: BlackRock's Rieder,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will likely raise U.S. interest rates at its December policy meeting, Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock said on Friday, adding that even a year-end hike was not a sure thing. “I think October is off the table,” Rieder told Reuters at BlackRock’s New York office Friday morning, after it decided to stick to its near-zero rate policy on Thursday. He noted that there will not be enough data released by the Fed’s October 27-28 meeting to warrant a change. As a result of the ongoing uncertainty and volatility caused by the Fed announcement, BlackRock sees opportunities in short-term Treasuries and investment grade credit. “I had thought that investment grade credit had very limited value for the past few years, but some of these spread levels are very attractive right now,” Rieder said.  BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager with $4.7 trillion in assets, is adding investment grade corporate credit, particularly in the industrial sector, where it is seeing increased supply, Rieder said. Rieder believes that even a December rate hike may be questionable because of year-end factors like the holiday season, when consumption is higher, Rieder said. The futures market implied traders see only a 14 percent chance of a Fed rate hike in October and 42 percent chance in December, according to CME’s FedWatch program. Going into Thursday, Rieder thought there was a 50-50 chance that the Fed would raise rates. “My head told me yes, but my gut told me ‘no,” he said. While he was not surprised by the Fed announcement, Rieder said he was surprised that the Fed did not leave more room for  rate increase in October. “Chairwoman Yellen did say October is live but I think they didn’t give a lot of reason why October could really happen and that part was surprising,” Rieder said. While Rieder applauded the Fed’s transparency overall, he said it would be helpful to the markets if the agency would be more specific about what series of metrics it looks at, whether it be the jobless rate or apartment rental vacancies rate. “If they laid out a series of indicators, that were not definitive, but gave you a sense... that this is the algorithm that is part of the thought process, it would be helpful,” he said. “I don’t think the Fed would have to be held to it.” ",9182015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-fed/fed-likely-to-raise-rates-in-december-blackrocks-rieder-idUSKCN0RI1MQ20150918

887,BLK,UPDATE 1-Canada pension fund votes to separate Bank of America roles,"(Adds context) Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board said on Tuesday it has voted to strip Bank of America Corp  Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan of his chairman’s title, the biggest shareholder so far to declare its intentions in a closely watched corporate governance contest. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank is holding a special shareholder meeting Tuesday morning on bylaw changes it made last year to allow CEO Moynihan to take on the additional role of chairman, sparking protests from other public pension funds who say the roles should remain separated to provide more oversight. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board controls 103 million shares of the bank, or about 1 percent of the bank’s shares, making it the tenth largest investor overall, according to Thomson Reuters data. Representatives for the bank’s top three investors - Vanguard Group, State Street Corp and BlackRock Inc - have so far declined to comment on how they will  vote. In an e-mailed message on Tuesday morning, a spokeswoman for the Canada fund cited a voting record posted on its website. The spokeswoman did not immediately return a message seeking further comment. Technically the fund and other bank investors are voting on bylaw changes made to allow Moynihan to take on the additional role, and the bank has said it will honor the voting results. The changes undid a vote by shareholders in 2009 to strip the previous CEO, Ken Lewis, of the chairman’s title, at the height of the financial crisis.

In May, billionaire hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz, who runs the $11 billion-asset Trian Management, narrowly lost his bid to win four DuPont board seats. While Kullman did not mention Peltz by name, her remarks showed DuPont remained open to shareholder input despite that aggressive battle. Kullman kept the hedge fund mogul at bay through strong relations with big name institutional investors that sided with the company, including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group, filings in August showed. “We must thoughtfully engage with all stakeholders, investors, regulators, employees and we need to see the world through their eyes,” she said. “We need to truly understand the expectations of our stakeholders and then we need to meet them, consistently over time.” “We encourage our board members to pierce through our operations,” she said, noting that she likes demanding questions. DuPont’s stock price “is a concern,” Kullman said. Since May 12, the day before the vote on Peltz’s bid was decided, DuPont shares have fallen 32 percent. They closed at $48.20 on Wednesday.

892,BLK,Motor racing-Formula One could be sold this year - Ecclestone,"LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Formula One could have new owners by the end of the year with three parties currently interested, the sport’s commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone said on Tuesday. “Our shareholders at the moment are basically in such a position where they have to lose some of their shares, or all of them, shortly,” the 84-year-old Briton told a Camp Beckenbauer Global Summit in Kitzbuehel, Austria, in a telephone interview. “That’s the way things are set up for them,” he added. “There has been a lot of interest and I would say there are three parties at the moment. I’d be surprised if one of them don’t buy very shortly.” Asked what sort of timeframe was likely, Ecclestone replied: “This year.” Ecclestone did not name any of the interested parties. CVC Capital Partners are currently the controlling shareholders with a 35.5 percent stake, while Ecclestone holds 5.3 percent. U.S. investment groups BlackRock and Waddell & Reed, along with Norway’s Norges Bank, are among other shareholders. Reports in June suggested that RSE Ventures, the investment vehicle of Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, was teaming up with Qatar Sports Investments to buy CVC’s stake in a potential $7 billion-$8 billion deal. CVC’s co-chairman Donald Mackenzie told Reuters in July, however, that the rights holders were under no pressure to sell. “We like owning it (Formula One), we don’t want to sell it. There are always some people who’d like to buy it, it’s a very good business,” he said. CVC sold down its holding from 63 percent in 2012 in deals that at the time gave the business an enterprise value, which includes debt and equity, of $9.1 billion. Ecclestone told Reuters separately in July that “lots of people have made approaches” and indicated he too might be interested in a takeover or buyout. “Donald Mackenzie doesn’t want to sell, simple as that,” he said then. “He loves Formula One, loves the business. He may have to sell his shares. “Whether he will invest himself, maybe with me separately, we will have to wait and see.”   (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis)",10062015,http://www.reuters.com/article/motor-racing-ecclestone/motor-racing-formula-one-could-be-sold-this-year-ecclestone-idUSL3N12643I20151006

894,BLK,BlackRock to boost shareholders' power after backing reform elsewhere,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Top asset manager BlackRock Inc said on Wednesday it plans to give shareholders new rights to nominate directors, bringing its corporate governance in line with policies it has backed elsewhere. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said it would amend its bylaws to allow so-called “proxy access” rights for groups of investors owning at least three percent of its shares, pending shareholder approval, a popular change other companies have made this year. “We continually evaluate our governance policies to ensure they reflect the latest best practices,” BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink said in a statement. The management-backed proposal would make it easier for groups of BlackRock investors to run their own director candidates. Similar proposals filed by corporate governance activists, including New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, were a major focus of last spring’s proxy season.

896,BLK,Market rules behind Aug ETF trading issues -BlackRock,"NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stock exchange rules designed to protect investors from market routs backfired on Aug. 24, exacerbating a selloff in exchange traded funds, BlackRock Inc said in a report published Wednesday. BlackRock blamed both automated selling by investors and exchange-required trading halts for a dislocation in ETF pricing that morning, when a broad selloff initially sliced 1,000 points off of the Dow Jones industrial average shortly after the market opened. That day, a group of ETFs sank an average of 30 percent from their prior-day close, often far below the value of their underlying stocks. Trading in 327 such funds was halted that day. Prices largely returned to normal later that morning. BlackRock, which has $1 trillion in assets under management in its iShares ETF business, saw some of its funds frozen. “The events of August 24 left many investors dissatisfied with the prices at which trades were executed and raised concerns about the functioning of markets and [exchange-traded products],” the report said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been looking into possible revisions of its rules on ETF trading. Fund companies promised to investigate the pricing issues. BlackRock and others have said that day’s dislocations were temporary and did not have an effect on the average ETF investor. BlackRock said complex issues led to the halts and caused ETFs to trade below the value of their underlying securities. But among them, they said, are rules that made it difficult for traders to operate. The New York Stock Exchange invoked a rule allowing traders not to disseminate pricing information when the market opened. While designed to help, BlackRock said the rule “inadvertently impeded” the information available to traders. When ETFs trade at discounts to the value of their underlying stocks, traders will snap them up and profit on the difference until they return to fair value. On Aug. 24, these traders could not guarantee that they would be able to execute that arbitrage trade because of the lack of information, widespread halts and the delayed opening of several stocks, BlackRock said. Retail investors may have had so-called stop loss orders in place that automatically sold funds as they dropped below pre-set price targets. Some may have sold at the bottom. The firm’s report included seven recommendations, including asking retail brokerages to better educate ETF traders who may be better served by using so-called limit orders that only sell at a certain price instead of stop orders that will trigger sales when a security plunges through a target price. The report also suggested that on extremely volatile days, market-wide circuit breakers be used instead of halts on individual securities.

897,BLK,Investors must get realistic on returns in sluggish markets: Blackrock,"LONDON (Reuters) - The most challenging global market environment in years will see annual investment returns slashed to just 4-5 percent over the next five years, strategists at investment firm Blackrock said on Wednesday. The high degree of uncertainty surrounding global growth and policymaking also means investors should diversify as much as possible and be nimble enough to reduce their exposure to risky assets when needed, it said. Sara Morgan, managing director of diversified strategies at Blackrock, said the S&P; 500 index’s average annual real return of 14 percent over the last five years will not be repeated over the next five. Instead, investors should expect 4-5 percent.  “The last few years were all about ‘how do I capture the upside’, but now it’s ‘how do I protect the downside’,” Morgan told a press briefing at Blackrock headquarters in London’s financial district. “You’re going to have to make your assets work so much harder.” Blackrock is the world’s largest asset manager, with over $4 trillion of assets under its wing. Morgan and her colleagues have reduced their equity exposure and bought 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds in recent weeks as the tremors from China, emerging economies and commodity markets have rippled across all markets. They have also dipped into the derivatives market to protect themselves against sharp swings in equity markets, and expect volatility to remain high. If market and economic conditions deteriorate further, they will extend this strategy further.  But they are optimistic on the outlook for the global economy, and therefore confident that markets can ride out the volatility. Global recession, as forecast by economists at U.S. bank Citi, is not Blackrock’s central scenario. “We’re at a very uncertain juncture ... but things aren’t as bad as people think,” said Pierre Sarrau, deputy chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at Blackrock.  He and his team are buying European equities, favoring Italian stocks in particular through buying call options.

898,BLK,Formula One could be sold this year: Ecclestone,"LONDON (Reuters) - Formula One could have new owners by the end of the year with three parties currently interested, the sport’s commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone said on Tuesday. “Our shareholders at the moment are basically in such a position where they have to lose some of their shares, or all of them, shortly,” the 84-year-old Briton told a Camp Beckenbauer Global Summit in Kitzbuehel, Austria, in a telephone interview. “That’s the way things are set up for them,” he added. “There has been a lot of interest and I would say there are three parties at the moment. I’d be surprised if one of them don’t buy very shortly.” Asked what sort of timeframe was likely, Ecclestone replied: “This year.” Ecclestone did not name any of the interested parties. CVC Capital Partners are currently the controlling shareholders with a 35.5 percent stake, while Ecclestone holds 5.3 percent. U.S. investment groups BlackRock and Waddell & Reed, along with Norway’s Norges Bank, are among other shareholders. Reports in June suggested that RSE Ventures, the investment vehicle of Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, was teaming up with Qatar Sports Investments to buy CVC’s stake in a potential $7 billion-$8 billion deal. CVC’s co-chairman Donald Mackenzie told Reuters in July, however, that the rights holders were under no pressure to sell.  “We like owning it (Formula One), we don’t want to sell it. There are always some people who’d like to buy it, it’s a very good business,” he said. CVC sold down its holding from 63 percent in 2012 in deals that at the time gave the business an enterprise value, which includes debt and equity, of $9.1 billion. Ecclestone told Reuters separately in July that “lots of people have made approaches” and indicated he too might be interested in a takeover or buyout. “Donald Mackenzie doesn’t want to sell, simple as that,” he said then. “He loves Formula One, loves the business. He may have to sell his shares. “Whether he will invest himself, maybe with me separately, we will have to wait and see.” ",10072015,http://www.reuters.com/article/motor-racing-ecclestone/formula-one-could-be-sold-this-year-ecclestone-idUSKCN0S02R920151007
899,BLK,BlackRock plans new social-impact mutual fund,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc will launch a new mutual fund on Tuesday that targets clients who want to boost the social impact of their investments, not just their returns. The BlackRock Impact U.S. Equity Fund will be run by BlackRock’s Scientific Active Equity Team, an internal group that mines data for investing insights and manages $90 billion in assets, according to Debbie McCoy, a strategist on the fund. The firm has been working to increase the investment performance and sales in its stock-picking funds business. The product is the first of its kind to be launched by BlackRock since the money manager announced in February that it hired Deborah Winshel, a former president of The Robin Hood Foundation, to spearhead an effort to help clients invest in products that take environmental and social goals into account. “The principal societal impact outcomes that are currently measured include green innovation, corporate citizenship, high impact disease research, ethics controversies and litigation,” said the fund’s prospectus, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund will exclude businesses such as tobacco, alcohol and weapons. BlackRock, which manages $4.7 trillion in assets, will offer the fund in three share classes, according to the preliminary prospectus. The fund reinforces a trend among asset managers and retail brokerages of aligning investors’ personal values with their investment portfolios. For instance, Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s Asset Management unit agreed in July to acquire Imprint Capital, which specializes in portfolios that incorporate environmental, social and corporate-governance goals. BlackRock will use public as well as proprietary sources of information to decide which companies make it into the portfolio, McCoy said. The firm has seen interest in new social impact strategies from both institutional and retail clients, she added.

900,BLK,End of an era: Mutual fund companies no longer a market bright spot,"NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The era of making a broad bet on mutual fund companies as a way to play America’s self-funded retirement boom appears to have ended. After outpacing the market during both the 1990s and early 2000s bull runs, the stocks of standalone mutual fund companies such as T. Rowe Price Group Inc, Eaton Vance Corp  and Franklin Resources Inc have fallen behind, gaining just half the amount of the broad S&P; 500 over the last five years. Analysts say there is little reason to expect a broad snapback in shares anytime soon, largely because the firms, big in the retirement space that mushroomed once 401ks and IRAs began to replace traditional pensions in the early 1980s, are now facing the flip side of those savings plans: withdrawals. Last year marked the first time that more money came out of 401(k) plans than was added, with $377 billion in withdrawals outpacing $338 billion in deposits, according to Cerulli Associates. Those declines are expected to accelerate as the baby boom generation ages. At the same time, standalone fund firms are losing assets to lower-cost and less-profitable passively managed mutual funds and exchange traded funds. Private firm Vanguard, best known for its index funds, is the world’s second-largest asset manager, behind only BlackRock Inc, whose iShares line makes it the world’s largest ETF provider, according to IPE Research. Even fund companies that establish their own ETFs may find themselves retaining assets by cannibalizing their own more fee-intensive funds. Adding insult to injury, fund company margins have been hurt in recent years by near-zero short-term interest rates that have prompted companies to waive fees on some funds. After selling off since peaking late in 2014, many fund companies have become cheap when compared with their historical standard and the broader S&P; 500 index. T. Rowe Price’s price-to-earnings ratio hit a 20-year low of 14.3 on Oct. 7 and has edged up slightly to 14.5. Franklin Resources’  forward PE stood at 12.1, up slightly from a 3-year low. As of Oct. 12, BlackRock Inc’s forward PE was at a 1-year low of 15.1, even with the S&P;’s. In the past, these companies have had PEs in the high 20s. Thomson Reuters Starmine holds an intrinsic value of  $49.80 for Franklin Resources stock, $407.90 for BlackRock and $90.15 for T. Rowe Price, all well above their recent trading levels. Mutual fund companies still have a lot of money in their coffers. Actively managed funds oversee a total of approximately $8.1 trillion in assets, compared with $1.6 trillion invested in ETFs, according to Lipper data. But analysts and fund managers say they have to be much more selective to make money by buying shares of fund companies. Even with their depressed share prices, not every one is a bargain. Investors say it requires specific attributes - a fund lineup with a history of beating peers or a sizable money market business - to help a company expand while the broad industry slows. “Not everyone is going to be comfortable going with a completely passive approach, especially if the market continues to be volatile,” said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research. Judson Brooks, an analyst who works on the $17.5 billion Oakmark Fund, said his fund owns shares of T. Rowe Price - down 14 percent year to date - largely because its track record of beating its peers should continue to attract assets. The company announced in July that 76 percent of its funds outperformed their Lipper averages over the last three years, and 86 outperformed their peers over the last 10 years. “The essential element of the company is that they have been able to maintain their outperformance, and we think they have a culture where that is going to continue,” Brooks said. Higher interest rates, meanwhile, should help the companies expand their margins. A 0.25 percent increase in interest rates would allow mutual fund companies to recoup 65 percent of fee waivers, while a 1.0 percent increase in rates would allow firms to eliminate fee waivers entirely, analysts say. T. Rowe Price waived $12.5 million in fees last quarter to maintain positive yields for investors in money market accounts, an amount roughly equal to what it spent on advertising and marketing. Once interest rates rise high enough, ending fee waivers should boost its revenues by about 1.3 percent, analysts say. Higher rates would especially help Federated Investors, which has approximately 69 percent of its $354 billion in assets under management in money market funds, said Argus’ Biggar. Shares of the company are down 9.8 percent for the year to date and trade at a forward price to earnings ratio of 16.1, according to Thomson Reuters data.

906,BLK,BlackRock profit falls in third quarter but tops expectations,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors piled into BlackRock Inc bond ETFs and paid more in hedge fund fees in the third quarter, helping the world’s largest asset manager beat Wall Street’s earnings forecasts and offsetting a higher tax hit that cut profits 8 percent from a year earlier. Rough-and-tumble markets saw BlackRock trim core investment advice and administration fees by $12 million from 2014 and give up 5 percent of assets under management from the second quarter.  But both institutional and retail investors sent a net $23.3 billion in new money to the firm’s iShares exchange-traded funds unit, the company said in an earnings report on Wednesday. That, plus a gain in performance fees by one of its hedge funds, helped bolster revenues to $2.9 billion, up $61 million from a year earlier. “We had a great quarter because our positioning as an organization,” said BlackRock chairman and chief executive officer Laurence D. Fink. “Despite the volatility, clients have to put their money to work.” BlackRock shares were up 3.45 percent in trading Wednesday in New York. New money moving into BlackRock’s long-term asset management business rose to $35 billion from $29 billion a year earlier in net terms, including the iShares business. Seventy-nine percent of all the new money BlackRock saw moved into fixed-income products. But the new money wasn’t enough to offset the impact of volatile markets which hurt assets and of currency swings which hurt fee income. It took a hedge fund to do that. While the New York-based company took in more revenue during the three months that ended Sept. 30 this year than it did during the same period in 2014, that growth was driven “primarily,” the company said, by a single unnamed hedge fund whose “strong” annual performance was measured during the quarter. Performance fees were up $75 million for the quarter to  $208 million. “We think they’ll continue to build out their alternatives platform, which could lead to quarters like this where they have strong performance fees,” said Rory Callagy, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. BlackRock earns sharply higher fees on alternative investments, such as hedge funds, private equity, infrastructure and real estate than traditional stock and bond products. While they account for 3 percent of the firm’s long-term assets under management, they account for 8 percent of base fees, as well as additional performance-based revenue not included in that 8 percent number.  Overall, BlackRock’s net income fell 8 percent to $843 million, or $5 per share, from $917 million, or $5.37 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $4.57 per share, excluding transactions that don’t affect the company’s value, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “I cannot control the world’s activities, and net income was a function of global capital markets,” said Fink. The company did manage to put a stop to net outflows for now. In the second quarter, long-term net outflows were $7.3 billion, the company’s first net outflow since 2012. In the third quarter, Blackrock paid $342 million in taxes, up $110 million from the same period a year ago.  The firm’s strong sales may be an outlier among its competitors for the quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co, whose asset management unit has been a top seller of actively managed mutual funds, on Tuesday reported outflows of $4 billion from its long-term products for its third quarter. JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment. [L1N12D2IB] “Investors seem to be focused on cost of investments so unless that goes away, ETFs will continue to be attractive given their fee rates,” said Callagy. [L1N12C0MX]  BlackRock has been working to improve the investment performance in its “fundamental” stock-picking business. Eighty percent of its products in that segment are above their benchmark or peer averages over a one-year period, Blackrock said on Wednesday, citing its own figures. Overall, BlackRock ended the quarter with $4.51 trillion in assets under management, down 5 percent from $4.72 trillion in the second quarter.

907,BLK,BlackRock's Rieder sees European bonds as attractive,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top BlackRock Inc bond fund manager Rick Rieder said he sees some European bonds as increasingly attractive after central bankers there disclosed they have weighed another interest rate cut. “We have a good portion of our risk in Europe today,” said Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income and manager of the BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund. “I do think the policy’s going to be aggressive.” Speaking at a Boston conference of the CFA Institute, Rieder said he sees as attractive “parts” of the credit markets and bonds at Europe’s periphery. “We think they make sense,” he said. “The policy’s going to be aggressive.” The European Central Bank held rates steady as expected at a meeting in Malta on Thursday after cutting rates to rock-bottom levels over a year ago.

909,BLK,UPDATE 2-BoE's Cunliffe says fund redemptions could hurt market liquidity,"(Adds BlackRock comment) By Huw Jones LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The Bank of England and international authorities are examining whether promises by funds to give investors their money back at any time could end up damaging liquidity in markets, a top BoE official said on Thursday. Sharp moves - “taper tantrums” - in U.S. government bond prices have raised concern among central banks, with asset managers worried they face heavy new rules. “A particular concern occupying both the (BoE’s) Financial Policy Committee and authorities internationally is that simultaneous redemptions from open-ended funds offering short-term redemptions could test the resilience of market liquidity,” BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said. Asset managers and investment funds were not a source of instability in the 2007-09 financial crisis, but the past is not always a guide to the future, Cunliffe told a British Bankers’ Association conference. Banks have blamed shrinking liquidity in secondary government and corporate bond markets on higher capital requirements, making their trading activities uneconomic. Hans Peter Lorenzen, managing director of corporate securities strategy at Citi bank, said a plethora of new regulation is a big part of why “air pockets” have emerged in bond markets. “It has just become much harder to make markets,” Lorenzen told the conference. Regulatory changes need to become more coherent, Cunliffe said, after so many new rules were introduced since the crisis to make under-capitalised banks more resilient. “It is quite conceivable that given the range and speed of regulatory reforms, there are parts of the framework that might not work in the way we intended,” Cunliffe said. But there was no going “back to the future” of tolerating more risk to financial stability as memories of the 2007-09 crisis fade, he said. Changes in the structure of markets and the ability of technology to connect buyers and sellers could also increase liquidity, he added. “It remains for me, however, an open question whether such liquidity would be resilient in times of stress. Automated markets may have driven down costs, but are possibly less resilient,” Cunliffe said. Funds already have ways to manage liquidity risks, but Cunliffe said investors may not fully appreciate how their ability to redeem, at or close to, current market prices could be compromised by large simultaneous withdrawals. Joanna Cound, head of government affairs at BlackRock , the world’s biggest asset manager, said poor liquidity has forced the company to split up trades into smaller parcels that can be absorbed by the market. “We started to make prices, not just to take prices, in an attempt to uncover more latent liquidity,” she told the conference. But funds came through the financial crisis well and volatility does not mean there is risk to financial stability, she said. “Volatility in the past has not resulted in mass redemptions or fire sales, apart from in money market funds,” she added. Cunliffe said more work needs to be done on policy options, such as a more system-wide approach to stress testing funds. “A second avenue worth exploring is better data on funds, including the development of more comprehensive metrics that capture the degree of any mismatch of the liquidity of underlying assets and the liquidity offering,” Cunliffe said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has just proposed ways for funds to manage liquidity risks.

913,BLK,BlackRock to buy Bank of America's $87 billion money-market fund business,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp, the No. 2 U.S. bank, has agreed to sell its $87 billion money-market fund business to BlackRock Inc in one of the cash-management industry’s largest deals ever. The transaction comes as big banks have faced pressure to simplify their businesses since the global financial crisis and marks the largest in a series of deals reshuffling the cash-management industry before costly regulatory reforms take effect in 2016. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The agreement is expected to lift BlackRock’s global cash-management business to $372 billion from about $285 billion, according to the New York-based company. BlackRock, a manager of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, private equity pools and other investment products, is already the world’s largest money manager with $4.5 trillion in assets. “Combining our business together with the Bank of America assets and distribution puts us in a unique competitive position,” said Tom Callahan, co-head of global cash management at BlackRock, in an interview. “It’s a challenge managing cash in a low interest-rate environment, so we have to be highly efficient.” BlackRock’s heft is partly the result of similar acquisitions, including Merrill Lynch’s investment management business in 2006. Merrill was later acquired by Bank of America and remains a major distributor of BlackRock products to individual investors and institutions. “This transaction is consistent with Bank of America’s ongoing efforts to simplify its business, in this instance, by outsourcing certain product manufacturing functions to an industry leader,” said Bank of America spokeswoman Susan McCabe. She added that the bank will focus on distributing money market funds from BlackRock and other third-party providers. The profitability of money-market funds, which invest in relatively low-risk corporate and government debt that can be paid back within days or weeks, has been hemmed in by U.S. interest rates hovering near zero. Mergers and acquisitions trimmed the money funds industry from 75 providers in the United States last summer to just 67 this year, according to Crane Data, an industry research service. Once the deal closes next year, BlackRock will leapfrog JPMorgan Chase & Co to become the second largest money fund family, behind Fidelity Investments, according to Peter Crane of the research service. The $2.7 trillion industry has lost some $30 billion in revenue since 2009, according to trade group Investment Company Institute, after slashing fees to prevent investors from losing money in an era of rock-bottom interest rates. [L1N11029O] The funds are expected to face increasingly stiff competition for a dwindling supply of the lowest-risk debt. A set of reforms adopted last year by the Securities and Exchange Commission requires money-market funds that serve institutional investors let their asset values stray from the typical $1 per share unless the funds invest primarily in government securities. Some $200 billion in funds have announced plans to invest primarily in government-backed debt. “Everybody has been talking about consolidation for years, but it really didn’t happen until today,” said Crane. “So many large players have resisted getting out of the business until now, but it’s just a matter of the costs and uncertainty of money fund reforms proving to be overwhelming to some players.” Crane said Bank of America’s decision came after an evaluation of which businesses were essential. “At the same time asset managers are trying to get bigger, banks are trying to get smaller,” he said. “This reflects regulatory pressure on both sides.” The deal is subject to regulatory and fund shareholder approvals.

Mergers and acquisitions trimmed the money funds industry from 75 providers in the United States last summer to just 67 this year, according to Crane Data, an industry research service. Once the deal closes next year, BlackRock will leapfrog JPMorgan Chase & Co to become the second largest money fund family, behind Fidelity Investments, according to Peter Crane of the research service. The $2.7 trillion industry has lost some $30 billion in revenue since 2009, according to trade group Investment Company Institute, after slashing fees to prevent investors from losing money in an era of rock-bottom interest rates. The funds are expected to face increasingly stiff competition for a dwindling supply of the lowest-risk debt. A set of reforms adopted last year by the Securities and Exchange Commission requires money-market funds that serve institutional investors let their asset values stray from the typical $1 per share unless the funds invest primarily in government securities. Some $200 billion in funds have announced plans to invest primarily in government-backed debt. “Everybody has been talking about consolidation for years, but it really didn’t happen until today,” said Crane. “So many large players have resisted getting out of the business until now, but it’s just a matter of the costs and uncertainty of money fund reforms proving to be overwhelming to some players.” Crane said Bank of America’s decision came after an evaluation of which businesses were essential. “At the same time asset managers are trying to get bigger, banks are trying to get smaller,” he said. “This reflects regulatory pressure on both sides.” The deal is subject to regulatory and fund shareholder approvals.

916,BLK,Bank of America to sell $87 bln money-market fund business to BlackRock,"NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp, the No. 2 U.S. bank, has agreed to sell responsibility for about $87 billion in money-market funds and other products it manages to BlackRock Inc in one of the money market industry’s largest deals ever. The transaction comes as massive banks have faced pressure to simplify their businesses since the global financial crisis and marks the largest in a series of deals reshuffling the cash-management industry before a set of costly regulatory reforms take effect in 2016. The agreement is expected to lift the global cash-management business at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from about $285 bilion to $372 billion. The New York-based company - a manager of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, private equity pools and other investment products - is already the world’s largest money manager, with $4.5 trillion in assets. The company’s heft is partly the result of similar acquisitions, including that of Merrill Lynch & Co’s investment management business in 2006. Merrill Lynch was later acquired by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp and remains a major distributor of BlackRock products to individual investors and institutions. “This transaction is consistent with Bank of America’s ongoing efforts to simplify its business, in this instance, by outsourcing certain product manufacturing functions to an industry leader,” said Bank of America spokeswoman Susan McCabe in an emailed statement, adding that the bank would now focus on distributing money market funds from BlackRock and other third-party providers. The profitability of money-market funds, which invest in relatively low-risk corporate and government debt that can be paid back within days or weeks, has been hemmed in by U.S. interest rates hovering near zero.

919,BLK,Top fund firms stay conservative in support for activists-report,"NEW YORK/BOSTON Nov 6 (Reuters) - Three top U.S. asset managers shied away from supporting dissident directors in recent proxy contests, according to voting data, showing how corporate management teams can still depend on key players in the fund industry for backing in the face of an activist fight. The data, dating back to 2013 and compiled by financial services group Houlihan Lokey, showed that since 2013, funds sponsored by BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group Inc and State Street Corp all voted for just a minority of the 229 board seats sought by directors aligned with dissident shareholders. That was a low count considering that dissident efforts - often led by activist hedge funds - won 126 of the seats, or more than half of the contests. Funds sponsored by BlackRock supported 83 of the nominees, followed by funds sponsored by  State Street, which supported 62 of them, and Vanguard, which backed just 29 directors. The findings of the Houlihan Lokey report from these funds run counter to the hopes of activist investors that the fund industry will come around to supporting their attempts to remake corporate boardrooms.[reut.rs/1kbyTkm ] Despite the growing acceptance of activism among institutional investors, voting against the management teams of large companies where money managers hold big positions remains a difficult choice, potentially because it could risk the fund firms’ contracts to manage company 401(k) money. “They’ve demonstrated that they’re somewhat more conservative than the broader investment community,” said Geoffrey Sorbello, senior vice president at Houlihan Lokey. “They have large positions, they’re very influential, and yet their voting record is often inconsistent with the eventual outcome of these situations.” The voting tallies exclude cases where mutual funds withheld support from management director candidates, which could in practice support dissident efforts. Also looming over the Houlihan Lokey data is the trend of faster settlements between companies and activists. In many cases, activist advisors say, the two sides settle because large institutional investors indicate to management that they are inclined to side with the activists. Vanguard Fund Treasurer Glenn Booraem, who oversees proxy voting, made a similar point. “Increasingly, activists and companies alike are engaging with large institutional investors to gain support for their views and listen to their perspectives,” Booraem said. Representatives for BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors declined to comment. The companies run huge passive funds required to own shares, and say they consider their proxy votes as long-term shareholders.

921,BLK,"BlackRock's Rieder sees value in emerging markets, high-yield","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) portfolio manager Rick Rieder said on Tuesday that he still saw value in emerging markets and high-yield debt despite fears that a tighter U.S. monetary policy could trim prices further. “The one area I do like - the emerging market sovereigns - I usually don’t get met with a lot of consensus on that one,” Rieder said, speaking in New York at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit. “Some of those sovereigns are much better credit quality than many parts of Europe.” Among the countries whose sovereign debt appeals to Rieder are Mexico, India and the Philippines, with a good deal of that foreign exposure hedged or denominated in U.S. dollars so they can prosper despite sliding currencies. Rieder is a manager of the $31 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BASIX.O) as well as chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income for BlackRock, which manages $4.5 trillion overall. Rieder described as a “grave injustice” the fact that strong markets get grouped with weaklings that could suffer under the weight of sinking commodity prices and potentially tightening U.S. credit along with geopolitical threats. Asked to describe his most contrarian trade, Rieder said strong emerging market countries such as Mexico and India offered much stronger credit quality than sovereigns in parts of Europe, even in countries there that he also likes, such as Portugal.  In Europe, rates are being pushed lower by aggressive easing by the central bank, and emerging markets could benefit from the same policy stance. Rieder said a rate hike by U.S. policymakers was overdue and that he believed the U.S. economy could withstand increases to 1 percent next year, from about zero. He said beaten-up high-yield bonds still held value, adding that the attractive yields on those securities could soothe the pain of a low interest-rate environment.

936,BLK,"UPDATE 2-Towers Watson, Willis merger gets shareholder nod","(Changes source, adds shares) Dec 11 (Reuters) - Shareholders of financial services provider Towers Watson & Co and insurance broker Willis Group Holdings voted to approve their merger, the companies said in a joint statement. The support by Towers shareholders comes after an $18 billion merger agreement between the companies was amended to increase the one-time cash dividend to be paid to Towers stockholders to $10 per share from $4.87. “We are pleased with the outcome of today’s vote and thank all of our shareholders for their support,” said John Haley, chief executive officer of Towers Watson. At the first vote to approve the merger that took place in November, top Towers shareholders, including BlackRock Inc , refused to support the deal which proved to be a critical blow, and forced the company to adjourn the meeting until Friday. A key goal of the merger is to have Willis, the world’s third-largest insurance broker, combine with Towers Watson to add consulting operations and help take on bigger rivals. The raised dividend proved enough to swing top Towers shareholders to switch their vote in favor of the deal, leading to the approval at Friday’s meeting.

937,BLK,Third Avenue junk fund blowup exposes risks of unsellable assets,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The blow-up of Third Avenue Management’s junk bond fund this week, the biggest mutual fund failure since the financial crisis, show the dangers of loading up on risky assets that are hard to trade even in good times.     At least one-fifth of Third Avenue’s Focused Credit Fund, with less than $1 billion under management, was composed of illiquid assets, meaning they trade so infrequently that they don’t have a market price, according to a Reuters analysis. That’s one of the highest percentages of exposure in the junk bond sector.     Meanwhile, some of the most popular U.S. junk bond funds also have made large bets on assets considered the hardest to trade and value in the industry, and their portfolios may not reflect the full extent of the current downturn in the junk bond market, said junk-bond analyst Marty Fridson, chief investment officer of Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors LLC.     “Precisely because these (assets) are hard to price, they won’t necessarily show the full extent of the market decline,” Fridson said. “That can make a fund with lots of illiquid security look better than a fund with big, liquid names where the price declines are very transparent.” AllianceBernstein’s AB High Income Fund has the biggest holdings on a percentage basis this year among the largest junk bond funds. At the end of July, the fund reported $1.08 billion in illiquid assets, or 15 percent of the securities in a $7.3 billion portfolio, according to a Reuters analysis of the 10 largest U.S. junk bond funds. The Third Avenue fund isn’t in the top ten.    AllianceBernstein did not respond to questions seeking comment.      With the $236 billion junk bond mutual fund sector on course for its worst performance in seven years due to a rout in commodity prices and expectations of higher interest rates, some big junk bond funds already are scaling back exposure to their riskiest assets.      The $17 billion American Funds High-Income Trust Fund, which this year realized nearly $200 million in losses on its most illiquid assets, told Reuters it plans to reduce its current exposure of 1.6 percent of securities that are hard to price and trade.    An American Funds spokesperson said the positions are carefully researched.       High yield, also known as junk, debt issuance has skyrocketed from $147 billion in 2009 to more than $300 billion in each of the last three years. Record-low interest rates have encouraged investors to take on more risk, including the debt of less creditworthy issuers, to get a higher return.     Tom Lapointe, portfolio manager of the Third Avenue fund, said in an October 2014 interview with Reuters that “any company with a pulse has been able to refinance.”     In addition to AllianceBernstein and American Funds, other investment funds such as BlackRock Inc and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc have junk bond funds - staple holdings for pension funds, retirement plans and mom-and-pop investors - that hold the largest amount of assets that are so illiquid and so hard to price that their valuations are sometimes pegged to assumptions made by the investment managers themselves, their fund disclosures show.         The illiquid debt favored by junk bond funds ranges from subprime loans bundled into mortgage-backed bonds by Wall Street banks on the eve of the credit crisis to bank loans to distressed companies in the energy and chemical industries.     Fund managers favor illiquid assets because they may pay 50 cents on the dollar to buy them, for example, and they get a yield premium for carrying the extra risk, said Sumit Desai, an analyst at fund research firm Morningstar Inc.      Most junk bond funds don’t hold any so-called Level 3 assets, which are generally considered risky and illiquid, or the amounts are less than 1 percent of their portfolios, according to a Reuters analysis of fund disclosures.     Junk bond portfolio managers already are navigating a treacherous market featuring a meltdown in the energy sector. Managers say junk-bond pricing volatility is reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis. And investors have made $5.7 billion in net withdrawals from junk bond mutual funds this year, according to data from Lipper Inc, a unit of Thomson Reuters.      DoubleLine Capital bond star Jeffrey Gundlach this week predicted “real carnage” in the junk bond market as the Federal Reserve leans toward raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.     The sector is losing 3.01 percent this year, compared with 2008 when junk funds lost 25.5 percent, according to Lipper Inc data.             Fund assets are typically categorized as Level 3, according to U.S. accounting rules, when pricing is unavailable and their value is set by internal estimates or quotes from outside vendors. By contrast, U.S. government bonds or blue-chip stocks are categorized as more liquid Level 1 assets because their value is easily discovered in the market and they trade frequently.     Some funds with the highest percentage of Level 3 assets also are among the worst performers, according to Lipper.     Waddell & Reed’s $6.7 billion Ivy High Income Fund ranked fifth worst with a one-month total return of negative 3.33 percent. The fund’s Level 3 assets were almost $260 million at the end of September, or 4 percent of the portfolio. The company did not return messages seeking comment.     BlackRock declined to comment about its holdings.     “For stuff that’s illiquid even under ordinary conditions, anyone who sells under present conditions will take a bath,” Fridson said.

940,BLK,"BlackRock, Pimco among group to begin clearing credit swaps","NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - A group of 24 investment management firms, including BlackRock Inc, Pimco and Eaton Vance, will begin clearing certain credit default swaps in an effort to revive a flagging part of the market used to hedge risk, several trade groups said on Wednesday. The effort comes amid renewed worries over the ability to trade debt following the collapse of Third Avenue’s Focused Credit Fund on Dec. 7, which jolted Wall Street and sparked a sell-off in high-yield bonds. Low oil prices have also been putting pressure on some funds and companies. The investment management firms will voluntarily clear CDS transactions connected to single companies and countries, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the Managed Funds Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said. (For list of firms, see: bit.ly/1Yint04) CDSs are contracts that let investors buy protection to hedge against the risk that corporate or sovereign debt issuers will not meet their payment obligations. Clearing involves sending the trade through a third party that guarantees its completion, backing the transaction using margin it collects, and recording the details. There was $8.2 trillion in debt guaranteed against default, not including offsetting positions, through single-name CDSs as of June 30, down from a peak of $33.4 trillion in June 2008, according to the Bank for International Settlements. “CDS liquidity has deteriorated sharply in recent years,” Scott O’Malia, chief executive officer of ISDA, said in a statement. “The commitment by the major buy-side firms to move to central clearing will create efficiencies and increase transparency in the single-name CDS market, which will encourage more participants to enter this important market,” he said. The 24 firms will also aim to migrating existing positions to cleared positions over time, the groups said.

Rieder said he was focused on “better quality” corporate issuers in the consumer cyclical, non-cyclical and transportation sectors. New York-based BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, with $4.5 trillion under management.

945,BLK,ETF issuers with currency-hedged ETFs ride high on strong dollar,"NEW YORK, Dec 22 (Reuters) - As the U.S. dollar strengthened throughout 2015, managers of currency-hedging exchange-traded funds had a banner year - they collected one of every four dollars invested in U.S. ETFs and rewarded their investors well. Now, they are doubling down with plans for as many as 41 new currency-hedging funds on file with regulators. But many of those funds may come to market after the easy money in currency hedging has been made. That could be reflected in some of the new fund proposals from BlackRock Inc’s iShares unit and WisdomTree Investments Inc. Both plan to launch funds that continually adjust their currency exposure based on the perceived value of the particular currencies at any time, a trade more nuanced than simply shorting currencies like the yen and euro while buying stocks in Japan or euro zone countries. In 2015, while the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan eased monetary policy, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Foreign currencies have sagged against the dollar, while the stocks of foreign exporters have been boosted because their products and services got cheaper in dollar terms. Investors flung $47 billion at U.S.-listed currency-hedged ETFs in the first 11 months of the year. There are now $68.3 billion in these assets, compared with only about $418 million in 2011, when the products were fledgling, according to FactSet. But even some ardent proponents of these investments, such as RiverFront Investment Group LLC, a firm which helped hedged-ETF leader WisdomTree design its first currency-hedged products, are starting to take money off the table. “You may have seen the end of the easy trade of being short the euro,” said Michael Jones, chief investment officer of RiverFront, which pared back its exposure to such hedges for European stocks last month. Shortly thereafter, on Dec. 3, an announcement of additional stimulus by the ECB was found wanting by the markets, pushing the euro up unexpectedly. Investors who used currency-hedged funds for the most part did well in 2015. WisdomTree’s Europe Hedged Equity Fund , delivered a 4.8 percent gain this year, as the MSCI Europe index slid 4.7 percent, according to Morningstar Inc data through Monday. And investors in broad emerging-market funds would have lost only 9.7 percent year-to-date rather than 16 percent by using the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  instead of the far more widely traded iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, the data showed. But other hedged trades failed to pan out, even as the dollar appreciated 9 percent against a basket of the euro, yen and four other currencies. Despite hopes that a sinking yen would lift currency-hedged Japanese ETFs, the Deutsche X-trackers MSCI Japan Hedged Equity ETF’s 8.6 percent gain through Monday is roughly even with the 8.5 percent gain of the iShares MSCI Japan ETF, according to Morningstar data. The new funds proposed by WisdomTree and iShares would adjust their exposure to currencies based on market conditions in order to favor recently rallying currencies, those with higher purchasing power and those in countries with higher interest rates, among other factors, according to the filings. Both WisdomTree and BlackRock decline to comment about funds that have not launched, but some of the filings said the goal of the funds is to limit investors’ losses when foreign currencies depreciate while also allowing investors to profit when currencies appreciate.

It said its iShares TA-25 Israel ETF is the first that trades the underlying shares of the 25 largest shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). iShares now has more than 70 single country ETFs domiciled in Europe. “Israel’s equity market was one of the fastest developed economies to rebound after the financial crisis, and our fund is a cost-effective way to invest in this resilient market and one of the world’s leading technology centers,” said Alex Pollak, head of BlackRock in Israel. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) said the iShares TA-25 ETF would be listed on the bourse, becoming the first Israeli ETF to list in London.  It will be traded in pounds and dollars and will have an international settlement structure with Euroclear Bank. The ETF’s listing “is a significant achievement for London Stock Exchange and for investors, allowing them the opportunity to have direct exposure to Israel’s dynamic, fast growing and entrepreneurial economy,” said Gillian Walmsley, head of the LSE’s fixed income and listed products. Israel’s stock exchange, which is in the process of demutualizing, has struggled in recent years with low volumes and the problem of companies delisting. Turnover improved to 1.4 billion shekels ($352 million) a day in 2015 from 1.2 billion in 2014 but that was below an average of 2 billion a day in 2010. “This unique collaboration will increase TASE’s exposure to international investors, who are seeking ways to invest in the Israeli market,” said Yossi Beinart, TASE’s chief executive. “We will continue to promote partnerships with leading international financial institutions, develop new products and be responsive to local and global market needs,” he said. Earlier this month, TASE and Nasdaq said they would jointly create a private market in Tel Aviv to support small growth companies in Israel.

965,BLK,Think long term - Larry Fink's message to CEOs,"Feb 2 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s Larry Fink wants chief executives of top U.S. companies to focus on creating long-term value instead of emphasizing quarterly targets. Fink, who heads the world’s largest investment management firm, said companies should still report quarterly results and “long-termism” should not be a substitute for transparency. “But CEOs should be more focused in these reports on demonstrating progress against their strategic plans than a one-penny deviation from their EPS targets or analyst consensus estimates,” Fink wrote in a letter to CEOs obtained by Reuters. BlackRock, which has $4.65 trillion in assets under management, has voted with activist investors, pushing for long-term value creation 39 percent of the time in the 18 largest U.S. proxy contests in 2015 by market value, Fink said. He also asked companies to involve board members in reviewing long-term plans and “explicitly affirm” to shareholders that their boards have reviewed their strategic plans. “This review should be a rigorous process that provides the board the necessary context and allows for a robust debate. Boards have an obligation to review, understand, discuss and challenge a company’s strategy,” he wrote. Fink also suggested that companies focus on environmental and social factors affecting them. “For too long, companies have not considered them core to their business - even when the world’s political leaders are increasingly focused on them, as demonstrated by the Paris Climate Accord,” he wrote. BlackRock’s corporate governance team will look for the suggested changes and a board review while engaging with companies, Fink wrote.

969,BLK,BlackRock's rocky debut highlights cracks emerging in euro CLOs,"* Asset manager ditches Single Bs * Arbitrage in European CLOs increasingly strained * Outlook for primary market bleak By Mariana Ionova LONDON, Feb 11 (IFR) - BlackRock had to widen spreads and jettison a tranche to finally clear its debut European CLO on Tuesday, the most obvious sign yet that the underlying economics of the asset class are close to breaking point. Market players worry that the eye-watering levels on the US asset manager’s CLO will choke off the primary market entirely, shutting out a number of managers that are preparing deals. “None of those deals have any chance of getting close to being done,” one CLO investor said. “There’s no point. There is no market.” There are six to seven European CLOs said to be pre-marketing at the moment, with BlueMountain and 3i both looking to price their deals in the coming weeks. CVC is also preparing a CLO, one source said. BlackRock had been looking to price its European CLO I for several months, but held off from pulling the trigger until recently due to thinning arbitrage and a heavy calendar of competing supply. But while Triple A spreads in the primary market appear to have found a ceiling, appetite for the riskier junior and mezzanine tranches has collapsed entirely, as a sharp sell-off in high beta credit has crimped demand for riskier assets. This forced BlackRock to ditch a planned 9.5m Single B tranche, which was originally whispered at an 850-870bp discount margin, according to market sources. “You can still place the Triple A and equity, its the mezz that has become the real challenge to find buyers for,” said an investor in leveraged loans. Arranger Credit Suisse sent out BlackRock European CLO I’s final terms on Tuesday, but did not disclose each tranche’s discount margin or cash price, only the coupons. This drew criticism from several market sources, with some reading it as a ploy to deflect from the deal’s poor outcome. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a deal with pricing details out and no details on DM,” one European CLO trader said. The 410.2m deal saw the 215m Class A-1s placed with a 150bp over Euribor coupon. Sources said it was placed at par, meaning the Triple As priced in line with the last three European deals. But the sources added that tranches lower down the capital structure were placed at deep discounts to par. They said the Triple Bs came at a discount margin in the low 500s, compared to the disclosed 450bp coupon. The Double Bs meanwhile are said to have priced in the low 800s with a 650bp coupon. This was in line with spreads in the secondary market, with traders seeing Triple B paper around 490bp and Double Bs at 800bp. Single B paper is now seen at over 1,000bp, revealing how ambitious the deal’s 850-870bp whisper for the dropped tranche was. It also shows how much the riskiest parts of the CLO market have widened in a short space of time, as Oaktree Capital Management’s Arbour CLO III placed Single B paper at a discount margin of 856bp less than a month ago. One source noted that given the further widening in this space it “doesn’t make sense to print Single Bs at the moment.” BlackRock began pre-marketing last year, with one manager noting pricing was originally targeted for the end of the third quarter. The asset manager held off as spread widening squeezed the arbitrage in European CLOs, which aim to capitalise on spread differentials between loans and collateralised debt. But with no sign of recovering demand, the group began officially marketing in January. “You’ve got to feel sorry for BlackRock because they’ve just been very unfortunate in their timing,” the CLO investor said. “I’m surprised they didn’t pull it, to be honest.” Some said BlackRock should have waited out the volatility. But others noted warehousing terms and mounting pressure to place the debut deal likely pushed the manager to print. “Keeping it lingering and lingering is not helpful,” said one CLO arranger. “But they got a deal done - that’s the important thing.” It is yet to be seen whether the strained economics of euro CLOs will knock demand for European leveraged loans, which have so far this year weathered the storms that have hit other areas of riskier credit. But the leveraged loan investor was relatively sanguine. “The way the market usually works, the equilibrium comes back very quickly,” he said, citing loans’ 25% to 30% annual repayment rate as a stabilising factor.

973,BLK,BlackRock says no need to stress test mutual fund sector,"LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, says there is no need for a stress test of whether the mutual fund industry could repay a large number of panicking investors in the event of a fresh financial crisis. Reduced market liquidity has spurred talk of conducting a test similar to those undertaken on the banking system. The Bank of England is committed to testing the mutual fund sector’s overall ability to withstand widespread redemptions, after a survey it conducted last year showed that funds were overly optimistic about their ability to cope. But Barbara Novick, BlackRock’s vice chairman, said the idea showed a misunderstanding of how markets work and any such test would not produce any meaningful results. “I’m not sure what stress test people are even talking about when they say ‘it will test all funds’. Really? What category? What does that look like? So, I can’t even envision what that test would be or why it would be meaningful,” she told Reuters.  Stress testing funds individually, as regulators have tested banks in Europe and the United States since the financial crisis, would be far better, said Novick, whose firm manages $4.6 trillion in assets on behalf of retail and institutional clients.  Novick said that if a particular security fell in price, certain types of mutual funds would step in as buyers, along with hedge funds and other market participants such as yield-hunting insurers and pension funds. “If you just look at one piece of the eco-system, you’re missing the dynamics of how the market works.”  That was particularly important given mutual funds only held a small slice of the debt market, she wrote in a discussion paper released on Monday.  A total of $34 trillion of U.S. debt securities were held by non-mutual fund investors such as pension funds, charities, insurers and households, the report said, while open-ended mutual funds and exchange-traded funds held just $5 trillion.

975,BLK,Top BlackRock fund manager buys more European junk bonds,"NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - A top portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc said his fund recently added exposure to European junk bonds, adding that “widespread pessimism” in markets has created new investment opportunities. The European high-yield market has grown attractive in part because of its limited exposure to volatile energy companies, according to Michael Fredericks, who manages the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund. “We recently increased the fund’s position in European high yield, a growing asset class with spreads near their widest levels in two years,” Fredericks said in a commentary distributed Wednesday. “The region’s supportive monetary policy, corporate deleveraging and recovering economy bode well for these assets.”   (Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt)",2172016,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-fund-europe-highyield/top-blackrock-fund-manager-buys-more-european-junk-bonds-idUSL2N15W16O
976,BLK,Banks build ETF businesses as growth stalls in bond trading,"(Reuters) - Wall Street banks are ramping up businesses that trade exchange-traded funds full of bonds, a bright spot of growth at an otherwise bleak time for trading but one that may carry unappreciated risk. Barclays PLC (BARC.L), Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) have all created special teams to make markets in bond ETFs. The teams include staff across stock and bond markets, since the ETFs trade like stocks on stock exchanges, but their underlying securities are bonds. All told, 12 to 15 banks now have a presence in the business, whereas a few years ago almost none did, said Anthony Perrotta, global head of research and consulting at TABB Group.     “There are a lot of institutions that, even though they might be retrenching in fixed-income trading, are looking at ETFs as a way to galvanize their business,” said Martin Small, who oversees U.S. operations for BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) iShares unit, which is the largest ETF issuer. Although these businesses are sprouting up across Wall Street, they are unlikely to make up for huge profits banks earned during the glory days of bond trading, at least not anytime soon. Investors pay banks 0.01 percent to 0.03 percent to trade a bond ETF, according to TABB Group, compared with 1.03 percent for an individual bond. Traders say they are hoping to make up for piddling margins by selling more of the product, since the ETF business is a bulk-volume one that is rapidly growing. The sales push comes after years of pressure from leading ETF creators like BlackRock and State Street Corp (STT.N) to make markets for the bond ETFs.  Those firms rake in billions of dollars’ worth of revenue from ETFs each year, and view bond ETFs as a way to grow their own businesses. Firms that create ETFs need banks to act as intermediaries for sales, and also to ensure that prices are in sync with underlying securities. Before banks entered the market, trades were handled by market-makers like KCG Holdings Inc KCG.N, Cantor Fitzgerald and Susquehanna Capital Group, who have been in the business for years. As Wall Street has warmed to bond ETFs, the market has quickly grown. Assets under management in the U.S. rose 44 percent to $372 billion at the end of January from $258 billion a year earlier, according to fund research service Lipper. That represents about 19 percent of the broader $2 trillion U.S. ETF market. While the bond-ETF boom may be good for Wall Street, it is not without risk. It comes at a time when liquidity in the corporate bond market has shriveled due to new rules that require banks to hold a lot of capital against those securities. As a result, banks avoid buying bonds from investors unless they can resell them quickly, and do not maintain much inventory for interested buyers. Despite their holdings, bond ETFs trade more like stocks, on stock exchanges, so they are not facing the same type of liquidity issue. But it is unclear how they will perform if investors rush for the exit all at once, or if markets come under serious stress. During the Aug. 24 “flash crash,” for instance, some ETFs failed to trade properly. “I think ETFs can be great products,” said Gershon Distenfeld, director of high yield at AllianceBernstein. “They just don’t work where there’s an illiquid market.” Despite those concerns, bankers seem happy to be building up a business that is in high demand. Barclays’ foray into bond ETFs began several years ago, but the bank has recently increased its marketing of the products to clients who are unfamiliar with them. The bank’s head of ETF trading, BJ Prager, said the business relies on staff who have expertise across stock and bond markets.  Credit Suisse launched a similar effort about a year ago. The bank’s credit team finds bonds for money managers to include in the products, and its equity desk provides technology to trade and value them. Credit Suisse sells bond ETFs through both channels, and includes them on Nitro, its ETF trading platform, so that clients can trade more easily. “It’s a serious initiative at the firm,” said Rob Bernstone, a managing director in equity trading at Credit Suisse. Goldman Sachs has spent the last six months building up its bond ETF business. Brian Levine, a co-head of equity trading who is leading the effort, said it involves “close collaboration” between stock and bond traders. Banks have also forged close ties with firms creating bond ETFs. BlackRock and other ETF issuers allow banks to sweep bonds that might have otherwise hogged space on their balance sheets into ETFs. And, each week, representatives from Blackrock’s iShares business speak to bond traders at all the major banks about the business.

977,BLK,BlackRock upbeat on emerging currency debt for first time in 3 years,"LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - The world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, has gone overweight emerging local currency bonds within its emerging market debt strategies for the first time in three years, predicting double-digit returns this year from the sector. “This is the first time we are positive on EM local currency debt in three years,” Sergio Trigo Paz, BlackRock’s head of emerging debt told Reuters on Friday. “We are expecting double-digit total returns in dollar terms in a year where most assets might deliver negative ones.” Trigo Paz had favoured hard currency debt since 2013, the year the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled it would cut back on bond-buying, setting the dollar on an appreciation path against almost every other currency. The Fed raised interest rates last December. EM local debt lost 11 percent in dollars last year, but has outperformed most asset classes in 2016, with gains of over 3 percent on the GBI-EM index. But Trigo Paz predicted at least a partial retracement of the dollar’s 25 percent appreciation in the past three years. Among central banks, while Europe and Japan are easing policy, the Fed is no longer expected to raise rates sharply. “So at least there is some stabilisation or a pause in the monetary policy divergence and this is the first headwind that has been neutralised,” he said. As for the second headwind, weak oil prices, he said oil exporters - members of the OPEC producers’ group as well as non-OPEC Russia - had demonstrated their keenness to prevent further price slides. Producers agreed this week to freeze output. “If you talk of a one-third (dollar) retracement, we talk of 7 percent. So in EM local debt you get to clip your coupon of 7 percent, plus another 7 pct on EM currencies if you get a dollar depreciation of 7 percent across the board,” Trigo Paz said. Asset selection can provide extra returns on top, he added. He favours the debt of countries rebalancing their current accounts such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil and Chile, as well as those able to cut interest rates. Most of the latter group are in Asia.

980,BLK,BlackRock gold fund may face penalties over unregistered share issue,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) iShares Gold Trust (IAU.P) may face penalties and other costs after the U.S.-listed fund sold $296 million in shares earlier this year without properly registering them, the company said in a filing on Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund manager, describing the problem as “inadvertent,” said it would immediately resume issuing shares in the $7.8 billion fund after suspending such issuance last week.  The BlackRock affiliate that supervises IAU said it may be required to re-acquire nearly 25 million shares of the fund it issued between Feb 19 and March 3, in excess of the shares it had officially registered with federal authorities. Those shares were worth $296 million when they were transferred, the filing said.     BlackRock said investors who bought and resold the unregistered shares “may have the right to collect damages” plus interest from the fund, and that the company may also have to pay SEC and state penalties. The fund may have to sell gold to meet those obligations. On March 3, after realizing the error, BlackRock stopped selling new shares of the fund - which trades like a stock on an exchange but is meant to reflect the precious metal’s market value. The BlackRock fund and its shareholders actually own gold, the commodity, rather than shares of gold-mining stocks or any other proxy. Investors have flocked to gold and related financial products as economic uncertainty, a weak dollar and falling expectations for U.S. interest rate hikes have spurred the biggest buying spree of gold ETFs in five years.  The filing does not disclose how much compensation for loss might be required or what penalties might be imposed, and representatives for both BlackRock and the SEC declined to comment for this story. “I’m not familiar with any precedent for the sale of unregistered shares of an exchange-traded product,” said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar Inc (MORN.O), who said the episode highlights the importance of understanding differences between various types of funds. “Not all exchange-traded products are created equal.” On March 3, the fund closed at $12.17 a share. On March 4, when BlackRock issued a press release noting the share freeze, it rose as high as $12.37 before closing at $12.17, a discount to the fund’s $12.33 net asset value.  Exchange-traded products (ETPs) trade throughout the day at market-determined prices. When they restrict creation of new shares, the funds often start to trade at a higher price than the “net asset value” of the investments the fund. The gold ETP is registered under a different legal structure than most exchange-traded funds, which do not have to register new securities in as cumbersome a manner.

987,BLK,"Stocks, junk bonds could gain despite slowing U.S. growth: BlackRock's Rieder","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks “can go up five, 10 percent, maybe” despite a slowing U.S. economy, BlackRock Inc’s chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder said on Tuesday. The market’s negative attitude towards the high-yield corporate debt market - relative to higher-grade debt - has also created an investment opportunity, Rieder said at the Harbor Investment Conference in New York. He said a rally in gold could continue as central banks push interest rates globally into negative territory, which erodes investors’ savings. Investors are expecting the European Central Bank to announce more monetary stimulus measures on Thursday to boost ultra-low inflation and sluggish growth in the euro zone. “Gold is mispriced by two or three hundred euros if we’re going to go down the road of growing the balance sheet” of the central bank, he said. “Money is going to go into gold.” Rieder also expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike the benchmark interest rate it controls one or two times this year, he said on CNBC, including once in June. And he said the bank’s use of an aggressive stimulus policy called quantitative easing, or Q.E., is not out of the question. “I hear people speak about the Fed may ultimately do Q.E. again; I don’t think that’s a crazy concept,” said Rieder, whose recent remarks on the U.S. economy had been more optimistic. “The world is slowing. I think the U.S. economy is going to slow.” That growth is slowing in part because of a rising U.S. dollar, which hurts emerging markets that had borrowed in that currency, Rieder said. The BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, a mutual fund managed by Rieder, cut all of its net exposure to the euro, Japanese yen and British pound in February, according to a BlackRock report on Tuesday.

989,BLK,Who's next? Asia investor activism set to grow after BlackRock public campaign,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Following a rare public campaign, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) voted against a deal planned by a Hong Kong firm that the world’s biggest asset manager partly owns, revving up investor activism in Asia after it roared ahead in 2015.  In a ballot on Tuesday, BlackRock rejected G-Resources Group Ltd’s (1051.HK) plan to sell its main asset, an Indonesian gold mine, saying it didn’t have confidence G-Resources would use the proceeds in investors’ best interests. Owning 8 percent of G-Resources, BlackRock urged other shareholders to follow suit.  G-Resources, which has said it would use the proceeds to shift its focus to financial services, reported after market hours that the sale was approved by a 59 percent majority. BlackRock’s campaign, albeit unsuccessful, highlights how investors are becoming more active in seeking out better returns in Asia amid ultra-low interest rates and sluggish global growth. The trend has been given added weight by reforms in places like Hong Kong and Japan designed to enhance corporate governance and promote minority shareholder rights, giving investors ammunition to push back against company management. “You have seen the success of activist funds in the United States improving businesses and increasing shareholder returns,” said Seth Fischer, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based activist hedge fund Oasis Management. “They are looking for further opportunities, bringing their critical know-how to Asia and saying, ‘Let’s produce the same things out here’.” According to data from research firm Activist Insight, the number of companies in Asia subject to one or more public shareholder demands more than doubled over the past two years to reach 31 in 2015, with nearly half successful, up from 30 percent a year earlier.  More than 65 percent of cases were instigated by overseas investors, according to Activist Insight, with U.S. fund Elliot Associates’ ultimately unsuccessful move to challenge restructuring at South Korea’s Samsung Group and Oasis Management’s action tackling Japanese technology firm Kyocera Corp (6971.T) and videogame maker Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T) among recent high-profile campaigns. Typically, much investor activism takes place behind closed doors, especially in Asia where there is a cultural aversion to public confrontation. As Asian companies are often closely held, it is much tougher to successfully push for change in some markets in the region.  But investors said making grievances known publicly can sometimes accelerate changes - especially when faced with management intransigence. Pru Bennett, head of BlackRock’s investment stewardship team for the Asia-Pacific region, said the firm typically raises any concerns with firms in private. In the case of G-Resources, however, she said BlackRock felt airing its view in public was necessary to rally support from other minority investors. “Engagement by companies with their key stakeholders is at an early stage in Hong Kong, but increasingly we think companies are seeing the value,” she added. Public campaigns are likely to become more prevalent in the region once success rates grow, with more and more companies preparing for greater investor scrutiny, according to Angela Campbell-Noe, senior partner at Tulchan Communications, an investor relations and communications firm which advises companies on how best to handle public investor attacks. “We’re increasingly doing crisis training and scenario-planning with companies, as speed and preparation are hugely important if a shareholder turns hostile,” said Campbell-Noe. “Companies are starting to look at their share registers and asking, ‘Could this happen to me?’” ",3082016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-investment-activism/whos-next-asia-investor-activism-set-to-grow-after-blackrock-public-campaign-idUSKCN0WA0KD

More than 65 percent of cases were instigated by overseas investors, according to Activist Insight, with U.S. fund Elliot Associates’ ultimately unsuccessful move to challenge restructuring at South Korea’s Samsung Group and Oasis Management’s action tackling Japanese technology firm Kyocera Corp (6971.T) and videogame maker Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T) among recent high-profile campaigns. Typically, much investor activism takes place behind closed doors, especially in Asia where there is a cultural aversion to public confrontation. As Asian companies are often closely held, it is much tougher to successfully push for change in some markets in the region.  But investors said making grievances known publicly can sometimes accelerate changes - especially when faced with management intransigence. Pru Bennett, head of BlackRock’s investment stewardship team for the Asia-Pacific region, said the firm typically raises any concerns with firms in private. In the case of G-Resources, however, she said BlackRock felt airing its view in public was necessary to rally support from other minority investors. “Engagement by companies with their key stakeholders is at an early stage in Hong Kong, but increasingly we think companies are seeing the value,” she added. Public campaigns are likely to become more prevalent in the region once success rates grow, with more and more companies preparing for greater investor scrutiny, according to Angela Campbell-Noe, senior partner at Tulchan Communications, an investor relations and communications firm which advises companies on how best to handle public investor attacks. “We’re increasingly doing crisis training and scenario-planning with companies, as speed and preparation are hugely important if a shareholder turns hostile,” said Campbell-Noe. “Companies are starting to look at their share registers and asking, ‘Could this happen to me?’” ",3082016,http://www.reuters.com/article/asia-investment-activism/update-1-whos-next-asia-investor-activism-set-to-grow-after-blackrock-public-campaign-idUSL4N16G3GJ
991,BLK,Who's next? Asia investor activism set to grow after BlackRock public campaign,"* Asia public shareholder activism doubles from 2013 to 2015 * Investors seek better returns amid slow growth * Companies prime defences against potential hostile attacks By Michelle Price and Elzio Barreto HONG KONG, March 8 (Reuters) - Following a rare public campaign, BlackRock Inc voted against a deal planned by a Hong Kong firm that the world’s biggest asset manager partly owns, revving up investor activism in Asia after it roared ahead in 2015. In a ballot on Tuesday, BlackRock rejected G-Resources Group Ltd’s plan to sell its main asset, an Indonesian gold mine, saying it didn’t have confidence G-Resources would use the proceeds in investors’ best interests. Owning 8 percent of G-Resources, BlackRock urged other shareholders to follow suit. G-Resources did not respond to requests for comment ahead of the result of the investor vote, the outcome of which was expected to be published after the Hong Kong stock market’s close at 0800 GMT. The company has said it will use the proceeds to shift its focus to financial services. Successful or not, BlackRock’s move highlights how investors are becoming more active - and vocal - in seeking out better returns in Asia amid ultra-low interest rates and sluggish global growth. The trend has been given added weight by reforms in places like Hong Kong and Japan designed to enhance corporate governance and promote minority shareholder rights, giving investors ammunition to push back against company management. “You have seen the success of activist funds in the United States improving businesses and increasing shareholder returns,” said Seth Fischer, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based activist hedge fund Oasis Management. “They are looking for further opportunities, bringing their critical know-how to Asia and saying, ‘Let’s produce the same things out here’.” According to data from research firm Activist Insight, the number of companies in Asia subject to one or more public shareholder demands more than doubled over the past two years to reach 31 in 2015, with nearly half successful, up from 30 percent a year earlier.

993,BLK,"BlackRock CEO Fink sees risks in China, negative rates","ACAPULCO, Mexico (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said on Friday that China may be the biggest hurdle to global financial markets and that central bankers are adding to risks with negative-interest rate policies. “China does represent maybe more global risk than anything in the world today,” he said at a banking conference in Acapulco, Mexico. Fink, who heads the world’s largest investment management firm, said China’s transition from an export-driven economy to a service-oriented economy requires reforming and merging its state-owned companies, which will reduce jobs, while creating more jobs in the service sector. He also said the country is recognizing a need to slow the growth of its balance sheet. Fink also inveighed against negative interest-rate policies by central banks, saying the easy monetary policy stance destroys retirement savings and prevents consumption. “Just like a relative who stays too long at your house, I think they stayed too long with the same policies,” Fink said of central bankers. “Let’s be clear: Negative interest rates are terrible.” Fink was particularly critical of Japan’s progress on economic reforms. He said the country’s aggressive monetary policy - including negative rates - needs to be coupled with a path to faster growth. He said India, too, needed reforms, in its case to the country’s bureaucracy. In the wide-ranging speech, Fink said Europe’s economy looks good compared with where the region had been during “the last few years” but that “an inch below the surface it is terrible” given ongoing risks to Europe’s banking system. Yet Fink said he sees a British exit from the European Union as unlikely and described Spain’s acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as running “one of the best governments in the world” given significant economic reforms. Fink also said it is hard for him to see oil prices above $60 or below $30 per barrel for a long period of time. “We are going to have lower oil prices for longer, and I think natural-gas prices are going to be higher sooner,” he said. He added that Mexico’s peso remains inexpensive compared with the U.S. dollar, a potential opportunity for investors.

1001,BLK,Prominent BlackRock strategist Koesterich moving to new role: memo,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russ Koesterich, who was BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) global chief investment strategist, has left that role and is joining the team responsible for the $47 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund (MALOX.O), according to an internal memo. Koesterich, who has become one of the company’s most public spokesmen on investment strategy, will become head of asset allocation for the team, according to the internal memo provided by the company to Reuters on Thursday. The mutual fund, which is BlackRock’s largest, is keeping the same listed portfolio managers, including investor Dennis Stattman. The fund is a “multi-asset” portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments. Richard Turnill, who took on the global chief investment strategist title for the BlackRock Investment Institute during a broader reorganization earlier this year, and his colleagues are “taking on much of the firm’s media and client-facing investment strategy responsibilities,” the memo said. The document was signed by Rich Kushel, who became BlackRock’s multi-asset strategies chief during that reorganization, which was announced in January. At that time, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink and the company’s president, Rob Kapito, told staff in a memo that the Institute’s mission was “expanding to include deeper research capabilities and an enhanced Investment Strategy function to deliver market insights even more effectively to clients.” Koesterich was a founding member of the Institute, an internal think tank that broadcasts the company’s views on markets. Koesterich, working from BlackRock’s San Francisco office, had run the BlackRock’s Model Portfolio Solutions (MPS) team, which does research on and manages some of the company’s investment products. He featured regularly on business television as well as in news articles and wrote widely read commentaries on global markets. He also was one of two portfolio managers on the company’s four Target Allocation funds (BAAPX.O) (BACPX.O) (BAGPX.O) (BAMPX.O), which have $883 million in assets. Vishal Karir is replacing Koesterich on those portfolio management assignments, while Kevin Holt, a 13-year BlackRock veteran, is taking over as head of the MPS team.

1003,BLK,BlackRock's Larry Fink paid nearly $26 million in 2015,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, raised total compensation for Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Fink by about 8 percent in 2015, according to a filing on Friday. Fink was awarded $25.8 million in compensation in 2015, compared with $23.9 million in 2014, based on a calculation of his pay according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.  But the company’s own calculations of Fink’s pay show his compensation flat for 2015. The calculations vary because BlackRock reports some incentive pay in a different year, according to the filing. BlackRock’s filing also shows the company will face an unusual test of its oversight of CEO pay at other companies, where its funds are often large investors and routinely vote in favor of their executive compensation. Fink’s pay included a $900,000 salary, a bonus of $8.7 million, nearly $16 million in stock awards and $193,000 in “other” compensation, according to that calculation. BlackRock President Rob Kapito was paid $20 million, the filing said. Fink, 63, and Kapito, 59, were among BlackRock’s founders in 1988. Last year was difficult for money management firms, which were whipsawed by volatile capital markets. The BlackRock board committee that analyzes compensation concluded among other factors that the company’s share of key markets increased and that the company showed “strong and consistent financial results despite a challenging” environment, according to the filing. BlackRock’s stock traded nearly 5 percent lower at the end of 2015 than at the end of 2014, while a grouping of such companies measured by the Dow Jones U.S. Asset Managers Index .DJUSAG fell by 12 percent. Over the year, the stock returned negative 2.3 percent, a figure that includes dividend payouts. Net income of New York-based BlackRock rose 2 percent in 2015 to more than $3.3 billion in a year of flat growth in assets under management for the company, which oversaw more than $4.6 trillion as of Dec. 31, 2015. Separately, a proxy resolution on which BlackRock’s investors will vote this year calls on the company to report on its own proxy-voting practices, citing among other things that BlackRock supports CEO pay more often than other investment managers. In Friday’s filing BlackRock’s directors urged investors to vote against the proposal, calling it unnecessary since the company already discloses much about how its Stewardship Team determines votes and that such a proposal could “threaten the independence” of that team.

1009,BLK,"At 'Hello Kitty' airline EVA, investors fret after chief ousted in family feud","TAIPEI (Reuters) - A battle among brothers for control of one of Taiwan’s biggest conglomerates boiled over into the public domain last week when EVA Airways ejected its chairman. Now investors in a rising star among Asian airlines fear they, too, may get burned. Chang Kuo-Wei, also a pilot for a carrier he had led since 2013, had just flown an EVA jet to Singapore when he was ousted at a March 11 board meeting called by his three older brothers, according to an EVA spokesman and Chang’s lawyer. No reason for the move was given when EVA announced it later that day.  At stake for the Chang family is control of shipping and transport giant Evergreen Group, whose founder and patriarch Chang Yung-fa died in January. For institutions invested in EVA, like the Vanguard Group and BlackRock, the question is simpler: will the $2 billion airline stick to long-haul expansion plans and record new jet orders mapped out by its former boss? “Investing in a company is investing in its leader,” said a fund manager at one of EVA’s top 30 investors who declined to be identified by name. “You buy Hon Hai Precision shares because of (Foxconn founder) Terry Gou. You buy EVA stocks because of Chang Kuo-wei.”  Widely referred to as ‘KW’, Chang Kuo-Wei wasn’t available for comment. His lawyer, Daniel Song, said the 46-year-old who steered the carrier’s recent strategy - including intensifying a livery and design tie-up with the ‘Hello Kitty’ cartoon character - is now “taking a rest” at an undisclosed location.  Chang has no plans to seek reinstatement at the carrier, in which he has a personal stake of about 12 percent, the lawyer said, but is taking legal action over broader issues surrounding the Chang family fortune. EVA accounts for the bulk of Evergreen’s profit amid a downturn in the shipping industry.  Officials at EVA and Evergreen said the other Chang brothers could not be reached, and would not want to comment on family business. After shedding as much as 5 percent after the departure, shares in the firm, in which Chang and his brothers own 44.5 percent in total, are now just 2 percent below their March 11 close as EVA pledges continuity.  “EVA has been around for 25 years,” said EVA spokesman Golden Kou. “What it has accomplished and its employees have delivered will not be affected.”  Still, some investors said new chairman Steve Lin, a company veteran, and the Chang family will need to reassure the market. “Foreign investors are worried,” said the fund manager at a top-30 EVA investor. “They are concerned that EVA without Chang (Kuo-Wei) would not be able to go further than it has achieved.”  Institutional investors hold just over 10 percent of EVA stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. BlackRock declined to comment while Vanguard could not be reached for comment.  Since Chang Yung-fa’s death, his four sons have been at loggerheads. The three eldest brothers, sons of the patriarch’s first wife, dispute a will that Chang Kuo-Wei - son of his father’s second wife - said last month gives him Chang Yung-fa’s entire fortune, including cash, properties and shares.   Beyond EVA, the group includes Asia’s largest container fleet through Evergreen Marine, catering businesses, air cargo operations and a hotel chain. Domestic media estimate Evergreen’s assets at more than T$400 billion ($12 billion) in total.  With Chang Kuo-Wei at the helm, EVA has risen to become a major player in the growing trans-Pacific market in recent years, using Taipei as a hub for passengers traveling from Southeast Asia and China to destinations like Los Angeles and Houston. The tieup with Japan’s Sanrio Corp’s ‘Hello Kitty’ character helped spread its brand internationally. It joined the Star Alliance group of carriers in 2013 and placed an $8 billion order, its biggest ever, for 26 Boeing widebody jets in 2015.  One of the incoming chairman’s first tasks in public is likely to be presenting the airline’s fourth-quarter 2015 results, due within the next few weeks. Beyond the numbers, EVA can expect questions from shareholders on the leadership shake-up and plans in the post-‘KW’ era. “Their new management has not told us what they are going to do,” said an official at one of the company’s top 20 investors, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said he would be watching closely for any potential threat to EVA’s “impressive performance”.

1016,BLK,Fund firms sue Portugal's central bank over Novo Banco debt,"* BlackRock, Pimco among fund firms suing central bank * Follows writing off of Novo debt worth nearly 2 bln euros * BlackRock says mutual fund savers discriminated against By Simon Jessop and Andrei Khalip LONDON/LISBON, April 5 (Reuters) - A group of 14 asset managers have started legal action against the Portuguese Central Bank over heavy losses on nearly 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) of bonds in Novo Banco, the bank created from the remains of Banco Espirito Santo, court documents showed. The group, which includes BlackRock and Pimco, said the central bank acted improperly when it moved five bonds from Novo Banco to Banco Espirito Santo in late 2015, which resulted in the value of the bonds being written down. After trading at par prior to the central bank decision, the bonds then sold off to around 15 cents on the euro by mid-January, for a combined worth of just 300 million euros. The decision to move the bonds from ‘good bank’ Novo Banco to the remaining ‘bad bank’ of Banco Espirito Santo, following the latter’s collapse as a listed firm in 2014, was taken after European regulators flagged up a capital shortfall in Novo Banco. The central bank chose to move the five high-denomination bond issues to BES on the basis that their face value meant they were bought by savvy institutional investors rather than ordinary retail investors. The bondholder group, however, say this discriminates against their mutual fund clients, many of whom were retail investors or pension plans, whose ultimate beneficiaries are individuals. “As a fiduciary, BlackRock has chosen to participate in this suit because it is in the best interests of our clients that own these bonds,” a spokesman for the company said in emailed comments. “The Bank of Portugal’s actions have resulted in money being unfairly taken out of the pockets of individual pensioners and savers, to benefit Novo Banco.” The bondholder group filed an administrative challenge in the Circle Administrative Court of Lisbon on March 29, court documents showed, without giving details. Nearly 30 separate cases have so far been filed by investors seeking redress for losses suffered as a result of the bond transfer, court documents showed. The Bank of Portugal declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday. The creation of the institutional bondholder group was reported in January by IFR. Confirmation that a lawsuit had been filed was first reported by the FT on Tuesday.

The fixed-income ETFs pulled in $43.7 billion globally as investors turned to the funds for safety from the market rout earlier this year. The ETFs’ positive flows have mostly continued in recent weeks as investors moved cash into riskier, but higher-yielding, corporate debt funds. U.S.-listed bond ETFs took in $31.8 billion during the quarter, according to the data from BlackRock, an ETF manager. U.S. Treasury ETFs took in assets every week of the year until the end of February as investors fled a selloff in other global markets on concerns about declining oil prices and economic growth, according to Lipper data. After a rout that lasted through the most of the beginning of the year, corporate-bond ETFs rebounded starting in mid-February as oil prices stabilized, fears of defaults by energy companies abated and central banks in Europe and Japan accelerated monetary-policy efforts to stimulate their  economies.

1018,BLK,Roboadvisers set to capitalize under new U.S. retirement plan rule,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A new U.S. rule protecting retirement funds from commission-paid brokers could be good for roboadvisers, a fast-growing sector that manages money with algorithms who may collect new clients fired by other firms because their accounts are too small. While it is not clear how much money is at risk of leaving bigger firms because of the new rule, industry trade groups say the costs of compliance will be high. Individuals with meager retirement savings or small businesses who offer 401(k) plans could get the boot from big brokerage firms because the revenue they generate is not worth the expense. The fiduciary rule, aimed at ensuring that brokers put clients’ best interests ahead of their own profits when advising on retirement funds, was released last week and requires all retirement plan advisors to be completely compliant by the end of 2017. Roboadvisers like Wealthfront, Betterment and Aspiration said they are in a position to scoop up business that has been tossed aside by larger brokerage firms. “To the extent that this rule starts undermining the business models for incumbents, it absolutely opens the door for innovators,” said Andrei Cherny, chief executive of Aspiration. At Betterment there is no minimum balance required, while Aspiration clients determine their own fees based on what they think is fair. Wealthfront’s minimum balance is $500. Roboadvisers have lower costs and offer smaller fees than traditional firms partly because they do not have to pay an army of brokers to sell their products. The Labor Department predicts the broader wealth management industry will face up to $31.5 billion in additional compliance costs due to the fiduciary rule over the next decade. A Department of Labor official said roboadvisers must comply with the rule just as human advisers do. But these firms already adhere to a fiduciary standard set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which means costs and fees may not go up in the same way. Arjun Saxena, a consultant who deals with wealth and asset management firms at PricewaterhouseCoopers, called the fiduciary rule “a big win for digital and online advice.”     “Many of the larger firms do have a great deal of smaller clients,” said Saxena. Some traditional firms may end up partnering with roboadvisers to offer low-cost services instead of pushing clients out the door, he added. Mike Sha, chief executive officer and co-founder of roboadviser SigFig Wealth Management LLC, said roboadvisers are keen on those kind of partnerships as well. “One way to drive up scale is to partner with traditional financial institutions that already have a trusted name and brand,” he said. When the Labor Department first started crafting its fiduciary rule in 2010, roboadvisers were barely a gleam in the industry’s eye. Although the idea has been around for more than a decade, it has only gained traction the past few years. The industry now oversees $100 billion in assets, or about 3 percent of the wealth management industry, according to Deloitte Consulting. By 2025, Deloitte predicts the industry will manage between $5 trillion and $7 trillion, representing 10 to 15 percent of U.S. retail assets under management. Betterment and Wealthfront are the most prominent roboadvisers, and came on the scene in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Since then, competitors like Aspiration and Vanguard’s Personal Advisor Service platform have also sprung up. Firms including Charles Schwab, Bank of America Corp, BlackRock Inc, and Goldman Sachs Group have either acquired stakes in or developed their own in-house robocompetitors as well. The wealth management industry has broadly gravitated toward a fiduciary standard in recent years, driven by client preferences and fee pressure as much as expectations that rules would get stiffer. The biggest wealth management firms inside Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co and UBS AG have been shifting client assets from “transactional” brokerage accounts, which generate fees by trading frequently, to fiduciary accounts that charge a flat fee regardless of how often they trade. Firms hit hardest by the Labor Department rule are smaller ones that still have a healthy number of transactional accounts, like LPL Financial Holdings Inc, analysts said. Insurers may also face pressure when it comes to selling certain annuities that face restrictions. A spokesman for LPL Financial said the firm will not be one of the hardest hit and about 40 percent of overall assets are fee-based, and roughly two-thirds of new assets are fee-based.

1021,BLK,"Investment in copper, a boom and bust cycle of a different kind: Andy Home","LONDON (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) Do you remember JPMorgan’s Physical Copper Trust?  Registered in October 2010 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was probably one of the most controversial commodity investment vehicles ever conceived. Although structured as a publicly-traded stock offering, it was to be backed by physical copper, 61,800 tonnes of it. Within days BlackRock had filed for an identical product almost twice the size with an implied holding of 121,000 tonnes. Copper manufacturers were outraged at the concept of nebulous “investors” stepping into the physical supply chain and several of them fought a two-year rearguard action in the courts to block it.  That action was ultimately unsuccessful. But by the time the SEC approved both products in late 2012, the investment tide had already turned.  The initial boom in commodities investment had turned to bust, leaving a long trail of fund casualties in its wake.  A new boom is currently building momentum but it’s a boom of a completely different kind, a reminder that investment trends in metals such as copper follow their own cycle, one which can interact in price in unexpected ways.  Link to my presentation at the Thomson Reuters GFMS seminar at CESCO Week in Santiago, Chile: tmsnrt.rs/1Q49nEY With hindsight JPMorgan and BlackRock’s physical copper funds represented the high-water mark of the first boom in commodities investment.  Money was pouring into the sector, $71 billion of it in 2009 and $91 billion in 2010, according to estimates from Barclays Capital.  Heavy-weight pension funds such as The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) had been experimenting with the commodities sector since 2006, Commodities, the idea went, behaved differently from stocks and bonds and therefore acted both as stabilizers in a broader portfolio and as a built-in inflationary hedge.  The trickle of initial investment, however, turned into a deluge in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis.  Central banks changed the rules of the previous investment game, offering both stick and carrot for fund managers to invest in commodities.  In the developed world zero interest rates and quantitative easing wreaked havoc on returns on cash and bonds, both bedrock components of most big funds’ portfolios.  China, meanwhile, was so alarmed at the contraction in exports that it unleashed a massive infrastructure stimulus, stimulating prices across the commodities spectrum.  Nuanced academic arguments on portfolio diversification were swamped in the general stampede to move money out of non-performing assets into rising commodities.  Those two physical copper funds were conceived as a way of tapping into that surge in interest, aimed as they were at the most conservative of U.S. pension funds, those prohibited from investing in anything other than U.S. listed stocks.  However, by the time that the SEC gave its formal seal of approval to JPMorgan’s physical copper trust in December 2012, the rationale for investing in commodities was already unraveling.  The copper price peaked at $10,190 per ton in February 2011. By December 2012 it had fallen below $8,000 per ton, undermining the appeal of what was in essence a bull-market product.  It wasn’t just copper. As the tail winds of Chinese stimulus faded, the entire industrial commodities sector was topping out, bringing an end to what had been a one-way bet since the start of 2009.  At a deeper level early experimenters such as CalPERS were finding that commodities were not behaving as expected. The years 2009-2011 were characterized by the risk-on-risk-off trade with every part of the risk universe moving in lock-step.  And by the time that changed, it was to the detriment of commodities, which started falling even while stock indices were still rising.  Assets under management in the commodities space peaked at $451 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to Barclays.  Under the double impact of collapsing prices and disinvestment the figure had fallen to just $160 billion at the end of last year, the lowest level since 2007.  Did the mass exit by fund managers exacerbate the collapse in prices? It depends on whether you believe the original investment boom was a driver of rising prices in 2009-2010.  Disentangling cause and correlation is nigh impossible and the whole topic is still a subject of heated debate.  But it is worth considering that the outflow of money from the base metals complex may have translated into the loss of over 600,000 tonnes of continuously rolling long positioning by funds invested in a commodity index such as Goldman Sachs’ GSCI.  Just as investment interest in commodities was dwindling in the developed world, it was about to flourish in a completely different form in a completely different place.  The London Metal Exchange copper price plunged over 11 percent over the course of just two days in January 2015.  It did so because of a wave of selling emanating from the Shanghai Futures Exchange, where market open interest hit an all-time high and volumes were the second highest on record.  Overnight the rest of the market woke up to the existence of  little-known Chinese hedge funds such as the exotically named Shanghai Chaos.  Unlike their Western counterparts, who had been drawn into commodities on the long side via broad-based commodity indices, these new players showed they could aggressively play markets from the short side. And they returned to attack the copper market in both July and November of last year.  Indeed, by November, it wasn’t just copper that was being hit. Both Shanghai aluminum and zinc contracts saw mass bear raids with volumes and open interest spiking to previously unseen levels. Aluminum was particularly interesting since the Shanghai contract had historically been relatively low in liquidity relative to copper.  In both cases the bear attacks lasted only a few days, suggesting a retail crowd surge that may have been looking for new ways to express a negative view on the Chinese growth story after Beijing clamped down on “malicious short-selling” on Chinese stock markets in July last year.  Five years after JPMorgan and BlackRock dreamt of bringing metals to the masses via their pension fund managers, the masses in China appear to have found their own path to commodity markets.  There’s still considerable uncertainty to what exactly is taking place on China’s commodity exchanges.  But the argument that retail players are getting involved was strengthened this year when trading volumes in Shanghai steel contracts and the Dalian iron ore contract went supernova.  The price of iron ore surged by 20 percent in a single-day, on March 8, and it did so amid an explosion of trading volume on the Dalian exchange. One of the most physically-rooted commodities, it seems, was dragged sharply higher by speculative trading flows.  It’s a new phenomenon for commodity markets, where investment has in the past been largely confined to professional fund managers. High entry thresholds, particularly on the LME itself, have locked out all but the very wealthiest man in the street.  And it’s happening just as Western fund managers are starting to dip their toes in the commodity waters again.  Barclays estimates that more than $20 billion flowed into commodities in January and February this year, the strongest start to any year since 2011. Most of that investment went into precious metals and the energy sector, but if it is the start of a larger (re-)investment trend, it will only be a matter of time before the trickle-down effect washes into the base metals sector.  And who knows? Maybe the dust will be blown off those filings for physical copper funds at some stage in the future.  After all, a long-only physically-backed copper investment to ultra-conservative pension fund managers may be a much easier sell now than it was back in December 2012.

1024,BLK,BlackRock to restructure after 'tough' first quarter,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) said on Thursday it will cut 400 jobs and take a $76 million restructuring charge after posting a 20 percent drop in first-quarter profit amid a dramatic reversal in financial markets. The world’s largest asset manager’s investment performance stumbled and its net inflows, albeit still tens of billions of dollars last quarter, fell as U.S. markets marked a rough start to the year. “We did have a tough quarter,” BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters. U.S. stocks, corporate bonds and energy all fell sharply in the beginning of 2016 but regained their footing in February. “The entire industry had a tough quarter in active management and we were no different.” Investors took the disappointing earnings in stride, initially selling, then bidding up shares by 1.7 percent to $354.32 by midafternoon.  Fink attributed a portion of the earnings shortfall to lower fees collected on so-called “active” investments, including hedge funds and many mutual funds, in which managers study companies and financial markets, making bets on future performance. The businesses produce higher profit margins than BlackRock’s popular index-tracking funds, which took in $27.5 billion despite the stormy markets. Net income fell to $657 million, or $3.92 per share, in the quarter, from $822 million, or $4.84 per share, a year earlier. Overall revenue of $2.6 billion was offset by expenses and taxes of nearly $2 billion.  With results adjusted to exclude the restructuring charges, BlackRock earned $4.25 per share, short of the average analyst estimate of $4.29, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “It was a quarter of a little bit of retrenchment, using the opportunity to take stock of where they’re spending money and refocus a bit,” said Neal Epstein, senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service. “They continued to raise assets and under the circumstances it was not a bad quarter.” BlackRock’s relative investment performance slipped during the quarter, according to its own metrics. Nearly two-thirds of the assets in its tax-exempt bond funds lagged their benchmark over one year. Only 41 percent of assets in the company’s so-called “scientific” active equity business outperformed. That group mines reams of data for insights on how to pick stocks. The company has focused on integrating new stock fund managers and boosting team performances. During a reshuffling announced in January, Fink and BlackRock President Rob Kapito combined the “scientific” and more traditional “fundamental” stock team under four managers. Investors pulled $17.7 billion out of stock-focused products during the volatile first quarter. Net investment in fixed income was $52.2 billion for the quarter, while $2.2 billion went into alternative investments, a relatively higher-fee unit that includes hedge funds, real estate and infrastructure. “The biggest challenge for them currently is the continuing effort to revamp and improve their actively managed strategies,” said Daniel Culloton, a Morningstar analyst. Fink said the company will continue to hire in the lucrative alternative unit as part of the restructuring. The company will also build its sustainable-investing operation, tailoring portfolios to reflect social, corporate governance or other values, he said.  The company did not give details on the job cuts. Despite the cuts, the company will hire in technology and its iShares exchange-traded funds businesses, Fink said. He expects to continue to increase the overall headcount this year. BlackRock Solutions, a unit offering risk-management and investment-analytics services to other Wall Street firms, governments and investors, was a bright spot as revenue rose 16 percent to $171 million.Overall, BlackRock attracted total long-term net inflows of $36.1 billion in the quarter, down from $70.4 billion a year ago. Most of that, $24.3 billion, went into iShares, down from $35.5 billion a year earlier, with the lion’s share invested in  lower-fee bond ETFs.

1033,BLK,UPDATE 2-Brazil's Oi starts $14.3 billion bond restructuring talks,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Oi SA (OIBR3.SA) on Monday formally started talks to restructure $14.3 billion of bonds, pitting some of the world’s biggest investors against each other as Brazil’s most-indebted phone carrier fights for its survival. In a securities filing, Oi said a group of bondholders that have Moelis & Co as their advisor signed a non-disclosure agreement to join talks. Reuters, citing sources, said the group of over 25 investment firms including BlackRock Inc, Citadel LLC and Pacific Investment Management Co, could sign the accord as early as Monday. The decision to begin talks with the Moelis-advised group leaves unclear how, or whether, Oi will negotiate with other creditors such as hedge funds that have bought credit default swaps linked to Oi’s bonds. The carrier wants to negotiate with bondholders who “care about the company’s future,” one of those sources told Reuters. At stake is the fate of Oi, the byproduct of a state-sponsored merger eight years ago and the only Brazilian carrier controlled by domestic capital. Shareholders see a restructuring facilitating a potential takeover of Oi, which they say could help narrow the gap with rivals controlled by Spain’s Telefónica SA and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s América Móvil SAB. Oi “intends to conclude the ongoing restructuring process promptly, as it believes that conducting negotiations with a sole steering committee representing the company’s bondholders will make the process more agile,” the filing said. Shares posted their biggest intraday jump in 23 years on Monday, on hopes the tack could speed Oi’s turnaround. Nonvoting shares (OIBR4.SA) rallied 28 percent to 1.18 reais, helping pare the stock’s 53 percent slump this year.   Still, a disparate base of creditors, the multiple currencies of issuance and a complex debt structure in which liabilities from several units are consolidated at the holding company level, could make a quick resolution hard, said Francisco Velasco, a fixed-income analyst with Exotix Partners. Oi’s restructuring would be Latin America’s second-biggest ever, behind a $15 billion debt overhaul by Mexican cement maker Cemex SAB in 2009, data compiled by Thomson Reuters showed. It would also dwarf the $5.2 billion restructuring of former billionaire Eike Batista’s OGX Petróleo e Gás SA two years ago, heretofore the largest such deal in the country. “Different investors could embrace different strategies, making this situation like a four-player chess game in which you won’t understand anybody’s strategy until the very last minute,” said Paolo Gorgó, an Italy-based investor who analyzes distressed debt and turnaround cases for several newsletters. Both Oi and New York-based PJT Partners Inc, which was hired in February to oversee the restructuring, declined to comment. According to the filing, law firms Barbosa Müssnich & Aragão and White & Case LLP were brought in as Oi’s legal consultants. At 54.9 billion reais ($15.4 billion), Oi’s gross debt looks unsustainable at this point, with almost half of it maturing by the end of 2017. Debt-servicing also poses a challenge for Oi, whose debt is 75 percent denominated in currencies other than the Brazilian real, which fell 16 percent against the U.S. dollar over the past two years. Oi has almost 200 different bondholders spanning from Brazil and the United States to Switzerland and Chile. About ten bond firms who did not join the Moelis-advised group have hired Houlihan Lokey Inc to form their own, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. Negotiations “will not be easy as there is the potential for high inter-creditor conflict, with different types of creditors looking to make the most for themselves, for which the process could be extended in time,” Exotix’s Velasco said. With the widespread notion that Oi’s equity is worthless, creditors may also seek to thwart any deal aiming to protect shareholders.  The price on the May 2020 issued by Oi’s Portugal Telecom Intl Finance BV subsidiary XS092758184=1M accelerated losses on the news. The security shed 0.07 cent on the dollar to 27 cents on Monday. The cost of insuring the Oi subsidiary’s bonds for one year through credit default swaps BRTO1YUSAC=MP were unchanged on Monday at $620,000 per every $1 million of principal protected. Creditors whose positions in credit swaps surpass their bondholdings by a large margin have an incentive to disrupt talks or trigger events that could force Oi into a default, Gorgó and other analysts said. According to the sources, the amount of net notional positions on Oi’s CDS is around $1 billion. Some creditors identified billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliot Management Corp, the fund that recently won a $4.7 billion, 13-year defaulted debt battle with Argentina, as one buyer of Oi’s CDS.  A spokesman for New York-based Elliot declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported last week that Oi feared that some bondholders who bought CDS were trying to push it into default. Lawyers for Oi were looking for ways to offset plans by those investors, the report said. Other elements could also turn negotiations even more protracted, bondholders and analysts said.  Brazil’s harshest recession in a century, and a political crisis that has delayed a long-sought overhaul in industry rules that would eventually favor Oi, may discourage bondholders from giving the company further breathing room.  The revamped laws could significantly reduce Oi’s mandatory capital spending in fixed-line telephony, where the company loses money on a regular basis.

1034,BLK,BlackRock bank loan fund manager stepping down: memo,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A BlackRock Inc managing director and portfolio manager has relinquished his role leading several debt funds to “pursue other interests,” according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Thursday. Leland Hart, who has been with the company for seven years and has headed the company’s bank loans team, will no longer oversee funds including the nearly $3 billion BlackRock Floating Rate Income Fund. Hart will maintain an advisory role with the company’s infrastructure debt team “in the months ahead,” according to the memo provided by the company. He joined BlackRock after the company’s acquisition of his previous employer, R3 Capital Partners. Hart’s departure from the funds comes at the same time as an earlier-announced exit by Paul Ebner, a director who was part of a different team that uses quantitative analysis to select stocks, according to a statement. Ebner’s last day is Friday. Hart managed $10.8 billion in money and accounts at BlackRock as of last year, while Ebner oversaw $2.2 billion, according to earlier disclosures BlackRock made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “We are grateful for all he has done for the firm and our clients and wish him our best,” said the memo discussing the succession plan for Hart, which was signed by BlackRock’s Global Head of Fundamental Credit Jim Keenan. Institutional shares of BlackRock Floating Rate Income Fund are up 2.6 percent this year, through Wednesday, behind the 3.1 percent average of its peers, according to Lipper. Over five years, the fund ranks in the 13th percentile among its peers. New York-based BlackRock managed $4.7 trillion in assets as of March 31.

1039,BLK,Exclusive: BlackRock targets 2016 launch for LatAm infrastructure fund - document,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc is accelerating its push in Latin America, making plans for its first launch of a private equity infrastructure fund targeting that market, a company document showed. The launch is anticipated this year, according to the document, an infrastructure investing plan seen by Reuters on Monday. Such funds typically target large investors who can lock up their initial investments for a decade or more. The size of the fund was not disclosed, and BlackRock declined to comment.  Since its acquisition of Mexican investment company Infraestructura Institucional last year, BlackRock has said it has $1 billion committed by investors and plans to invest broadly across the energy, utility, transportation and communication infrastructure sectors in the region, especially in Mexico. BlackRock started its infrastructure unit in 2011, and more recently has focused on growth in Latin America. The unit oversees physical property as well as relationships, from construction sub-contractors to government officials. To date, the unit has been known for specializing in renewable-energy projects and being rooted in developed markets in Europe, the United States and Asia. The company has about $9 billion in infrastructure assets under management overall. The firm has expanded, hiring foreign executives, including Manuel Sanchez, the former chief executive of Spanish renewable energy company Abengoa. BlackRock now has 26 people currently assigned in the Latin America infrastructure effort. In its expansion south, BlackRock expects more government policy reforms of the sort that ended Mexico’s decades-old state energy monopoly across the Americas. Mexico’s economy grew more quickly than expected in the first quarter this year, preliminary data showed last month, after uneven U.S. demand and sinking oil prices shook the economy in 2015. Company executives have said they expect large investors, including pension funds, to boost their stakes in investments such as railroads, pipelines and wind farms in the hope that they will return a stream of cash for pensioners and other investors. In addition to expanding its Mexico City-based team, BlackRock last year took a joint stake worth around $900 million in a Mexican natural-gas pipeline project with U.S. private equity company First Reserve that is expected to start operating this year. It is also looking at expanding to other countries, such as Colombia, Peru and Chile, company officials have said. New York-based BlackRock managed $4.7 trillion overall as of March 31.

1043,BLK,BlackRock helps ECB in bank stress test,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A consultancy owned by the world’s biggest investor, BlackRock, will help the European Central Bank in its stress test of top banks, the two organizations said on Wednesday. The tests uncover sensitive information about banks, such as how many of their loans are likely to go unpaid, but the ECB said there was a strict separation between investors at BlackRock, which owns shares in all top European banks, and the consultancy arm. The tests are the latest probe of big banks in the euro zone from carmaker Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) finance arm to France’s BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA).  The ECB, put in charge of monitoring those banks after the financial crash, uses the check to identify problems at lenders.  The consultancy arm of BlackRock, BlackRock Solutions, has experts who help diagnose risks, for example, or put a value on risky loans.  The ECB said there was a separation between the consultancy work and other parts of the parent firm. BlackRock itself manages $4.7 trillion and has stakes in all major European banks, including a 6 percent shareholding in Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE).  “Confidentiality of information is secured by the terms of the contract,” said a spokesman for the ECB. BlackRock’s consultancy arm has also helped the ECB design a scheme to buy asset-backed securities - loans that are bundled together and sold. The ECB tests will probe 39 banks in the euro zone. The results will be ready toward the middle of the year.  Some analysts criticized earlier tests for underplaying the scale of banking problems.  Checks in late 2014 revealed modest capital holes at Greek banks, for instance. Later, after a leftist government came to power, capital controls were introduced and Greece nearly tumbled out of the euro.  Roughly 40 percent of Greek loans are now considered unlikely to be repaid. ",5112016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecb-policy-tests/blackrock-helps-ecb-in-bank-stress-test-idUSKCN0Y215S

1052,BLK,BlackRock's Fink says China needs more aggressive reforms,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China needs to be more aggressive in its reforms if it wants to smoothly transition from an export-oriented economy to a services-driven one, the head of BlackRock Inc. (BLK.N), the world’s biggest asset manager, said on Tuesday. “China is struggling with excessive leverage within a lot of financial institutions,” BlackRock Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said at a BlackRock forum in Hong Kong. “They need to be more aggressive in their reforms. Reforms are slower than what I would have preferred.” Fink said Beijing has done a good job in identifying the need to transform its economy and make it less dependent on manufacturing. But he noted similar reforms in the West in the past took decades and were marked by periods of economic recession. Although remaining slightly bullish on China, he said there were still too many state-owned enterprises in China and that the recent explosion in credit was “the wrong way to reorient the economy”. Fink said the ultra-low interest rate environment globally, which was exacerbated by Japan’s decision to introduce negative rates this year, is harming the economy. He called on governments to implement fiscal stimulus programmes, particularly for infrastructure. Japan, which is hosting the upcoming meeting of the Group of Seven nations this month, had failed to fully deliver on the economic reforms promised through “Abenomics”, he said. Fink hoped G7 leaders would discuss the need for fiscal stimulus at their upcoming meeting. “We have not seen any true fiscal policy. It is going to require a heavy dose of infrastructure investments,” he said. “You cannot have central banks stopping this low rate environment unless we have government action.” ",5172016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-fink/blackrocks-fink-says-china-needs-more-aggressive-reforms-idUSKCN0Y8062

1055,BLK,"Scientists, investors seek to identify financial risks of climate change","OSLO (Reuters) - A Norwegian group of climate scientists will form an alliance on Thursday with investors including BlackRock Inc and the World Bank to try to assess the financial risks of rising global temperatures. The Center for International Climate and Environmental Research, Oslo (CICERO) said it wanted to help investors judge risks from global warming such as more heatwaves, floods, downpours, the extinction of animals and plants and rising seas. The head of CICERO, Kristin Halvorsen, said the aim was to help investors and researchers to “understand each other more easily so that the financial sector can define climate risks”. “We speak very different languages. Research and investment are two different worlds,” Halvorsen, a former Norwegian finance minister, told Reuters on Wednesday, noting that the financial sector’s main concern was the return on its investments. Representatives of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company, World Bank Treasury, Swedish pension fund AP2, Nordic bank SEB and Norwegian bank DNB would be among those on an advisory board for the CICERO Climate Finance project, to be launched on Thursday. The first meeting would work to define common projects. Some investors, for instance, are pulling out of companies that mine or generate power from coal, reckoning that reserves of coal will steadily lose value from a shift to cleaner energies. And extreme events such as wildfires, heatwaves or floods can disrupt investments in infrastructure, ranging from road bridges to oil pipelines. But it is hard to assess risks for individual places. “If extreme events become more frequent, what does that mean for infrastructure?” said Christa Clapp of CICERO, an expert in assessing the environmental quality of green bonds. Ulrika Danielson, spokeswoman for AP2 which has about 300 billion Swedish crowns ($36.19 billion) under management, welcomed the plan to do more to unite research and investment. “We look at climate change as a risk in our portfolio,” she said. Halvorsen said interest from investors to learn about climate change had risen after 195 nations agreed a global deal in Paris last December to combat climate change, shifting the global economy from fossil fuels.

1056,BLK,BlackRock nabs Canada pension chief Wiseman for senior role,"TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, has recruited the head of Canada’s biggest public pension fund to become the top executive overseeing its stock-picking operations. Wiseman, 45, who has transformed the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) into one of the world’s most active dealmakers over the past four years, will step down next month and become head of BlackRock’s global active equity business in September. Wiseman will be replaced by Mark Machin, the head of CPPIB’s international operations. Wiseman will become a member of BlackRock’s Global Executive Committee, an exclusive club of fewer than two-dozen senior deputies to BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink and President Rob Kapito. He will be one of a much smaller subset of those people with oversight over investing teams, taking over a group within the executive committee focused on investments, according to a statement. He will also oversee some 350 portfolio managers and other staff responsible for $275 billion in investments. New York-based BlackRock managed $4.7 trillion on March 31. Fink has been working with Wiseman on a group called Focusing Capital on the Long Term, which has advocated that institutions invest more of their money with companies whose executives show a dedication to long-term success, rather than appeasing markets every quarter. Wiseman joins the company during an unsettled period for active money managers. Markets and a trend toward low-cost passive investing have conspired to make the business of managing and selling actively managed stock funds a zero-sum game. BlackRock’s relative investment performance slipped last quarter, according to its own metrics. In a bid to boost its performance, BlackRock has scoured the industry for top managers and invested in technology, as well as what it calls a “scientific” active equity business that mines reams of data for insight on which stocks to pick.  During a reshuffling announced in January, Fink and Kapito combined the previously separate scientific and “fundamental” teams under four managers after the departures of their two prior leaders. A sign of how much of a priority the unit is for the company, the unit’s leaders since then - Chris Jones, Nigel Bolton, Raffaele Savi and Jeff Shen - reported directly to Kapito. Bolton, Savi and Shen will become co-chief investment officers of the unit, while Jones is leaving BlackRock, a spokesman said. While BlackRock benefits from the low-cost trend through its index funds and a booming iShares exchange-traded funds franchise, those strategies can be less profitable. Wiseman will also become chairman of BlackRock Alternative Investors, a smaller, but highly-lucrative group of BlackRock investments, including its hedge funds and infrastructure business. Under Wiseman’s leadership, CPPIB has increased its exposure to those kinds of assets to counter volatile markets and low-yielding government bonds. BlackRock’s alternatives business will still be run day-to-day by Mark McCombe, another senior managing director, and his colleague Matt Botein, but BlackRock said in a statement that Wiseman will help develop new investment strategies and clients.  Wiseman will join a list of potential long-term successors to Fink, 63, but said that had not been a factor in his decision to leave CPPIB. He added that his decision to leave CPPIB had been “incredibly difficult”. Wiseman has raised the global profile of CPPIB, turning it into one of the first ports of call for investment bankers selling assets. He has overseen a broad range of investments abroad, including the $12 billion acquisition of GE Capital’s private equity lending portfolio. He is also a passionate advocate of long-term investment strategies. Machin, Wiseman’s replacement, joined CPPIB in 2012 after spending two decades at Goldman Sachs, spear-heading their operations in Asia before departing the investment bank. Machin said his appointment will not result in any change in strategy for the institution. “I was one of the senior team who developed the strategy. It’s something I believe in, there will be no change at all,” he said. Machin’s appointment comes at a time when the percentage of the CPP Fund invested outside of Canada has risen to approximately 81 percent, with geographic diversification being a key factor behind its growth. Machin will continue to head CPPIB’s Asia and International businesses until a successor is identified, the fund said. “There is no doubt that overseas investing is crucial for a plan like CPP, with a lot of exposure to the Canadian economy, and Mark’s deep experience in this area, no doubt, played a role,” said Donald Raymond, CPPIB’s former chief investment strategist, who worked with Machin before joining alternative investment company Alignvest.

1059,BLK,"BlackRock sees big challenges for investors, boards on cyber risks","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors are facing major challenges in assessing cyber security risks because companies are wary of disclosing breaches fearing they could make them more vulnerable, according to BlackRock’s (BLK.N) head of investment stewardship for Asia Pacific. Over the past two years the world’s largest asset manager has stepped up pressure on companies to ensure they have robust procedures in place for managing cyber risks, but it is tough to engage boards on this sensitive issue, Pru Bennett told the Reuters Financial Regulation Summit. “Disclosure is a challenge for companies on cyber security. It could attract attention. We’re not pushing for disclosure, but who has responsibility and where in the board does the accountability lie. The most important thing is to keep up to date.  “It’s a real challenge for boards, there’s no question about it, and it’s a challenge for us as well in engaging with boards on the issue.” The global financial system is still reeling nearly two months after a still-unidentified group was able to use malware to hack the SWIFT bank messaging network and steal $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank.  The February heist prompted Mary Jo White, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to warn on Wednesday that cyber security is the biggest risk facing the financial system. Bennett said cyber security had become a corporate governance concern for investors and that boards needed to ensure companies have controls in place to keep on top of the risks. “I’m not saying every board has to have a cyber expert, but if you’ve got competent people who understand the issues, can listen to an expert, assimilate that information, and make decisions accordingly, that’s what we want on the board,” Bennett told the summit in Hong Kong. In many Asian markets, issuers are required to provide only minimal information on their board members, but BlackRock has been pushing for greater disclosure on board members’ experience and skill sets.

1061,BLK,BlackRock's largest mutual fund favors Japan despite yen concerns,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A strategist for BlackRock Inc’s largest mutual fund said on Friday his fund is finding bargains among Japanese stocks despite their weak performance this year and concerns over the direction of the yen. “When I look among developed-market equities a lot of the truly cheap stocks we find right now are in Japan,” Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation for the $46 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund, said in an interview. “You do see some improvement in corporate governance, you do see some improvement in the profitability of Japanese companies, and we do still think there’s a reasonable chance that the government will try to stimulate the economy,” he said. The fund’s last holdings report shows an allocation to Japan of 8.7 percent, nearly double the allocation held by the fund’s benchmark. The Nikkei 225 index has returned negative 12.4 percent this year. Institutional shares of the BlackRock fund have returned negative 1 percent so far this year, putting it in the 76 percentile among its peers, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. Over 10 years, the fund ranks in the 22nd percentile. Japan has indicated its willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stem gains in the yen, which hurt its exporters’ sales. But the United States has suggested that Tokyo has no justification to intervene in the market given an “orderly” currency market.

1063,BLK,Some foreign investors target India's top bourse in rare shareholder backlash,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Some foreign investors are accusing India’s National Stock Exchange of dragging its feet on an initial public offering, saying management is ignoring them and purging their views from minutes of meetings, letters and emails seen by Reuters show. Five investors, who together own 10.1 percent of India’s biggest exchange by trading volumes, said “shareholder interest and corporate governance norms have been blatantly disregarded” as a result, according to a March 7 letter sent to the bourse and seen by Reuters, which has previously not been reported. “The NSE is a model of poor corporate governance,” said Sohil Chand, a managing director at U.S. firm Norwest Venture Partners, one of the foreign funds that signed the letter, in an interview. “There is zero transparency and there’s zero accountability.” An NSE spokesman rejected the accusations but declined to discuss individual letters. “We do not want to respond to those misplaced concerns and motivated campaigns,” the spokesman said in an email. The investor letters and emails mark an escalation in a months-long battle between the exchange and these investors over a potential listing of the NSE. The funds, some of which have invested in the NSE for almost a decade, want the exchange to list as soon as possible so that they can exit and pay back investors in their funds. But the company has been reluctant because Indian law requires it to list on another exchange rather than on itself, which would expose it to being regulated by a rival bourse. The NSE has said it is lobbying regulators for permission to self-list or be regulated by the country’s securities regulator. The fight is the latest sign that shareholder activism, though still rare, is beginning to gain traction in India, where companies face few challenges from investors and governance problems are common. Most recently, Children’s Investment Fund waged a two-year battle against Coal India (COAL.NS) and the government over accusations of mismanagement, which ended after the British-based hedge fund exited from its investment in 2014. That increased activism is visible more broadly across Asia, as investors seek better returns amid ultra-low interest rates and sluggish global growth. Recent examples include an unsuccessful public campaign by BlackRock Inc against a deal planned by a Hong Kong firm G-Resources Group Ltd, and high-profile battles waged against South Korea’s Samsung Group and Japanese videogame maker Nintendo Co Ltd. In the case of NSE, the funds leading the campaign are all foreign institutional investors who invested in the market by buying stakes from earlier domestic institutional investors. Other funds that signed the March 7 letter consist of a group of private equity and venture capital firms, most of which have funds based in Mauritius: Beacon India, GTI Capital, DVI and SAIF Partners. An NSE board member who stepped down this year denied the investors’ accusations and said the company had genuine concerns about listing on a separate exchange. He said there had been a lot of misinformation regarding the NSE’s stance. “Some shareholders are getting very impatient. They think we are dragging our feet, which is not correct,” he told Reuters, declining to be identified as he has not been authorized to speak by the exchange. In equities, still the main part of the business, the NSE had average daily volumes of 171.9 billion rupees ($2.56 billion) in April, and it monitors governance across its more than 1,600 listed securities. The older BSE Ltd, formerly known as Bombay Stock Exchange, had 27.3 billion rupees in average daily volumes last month. Further rankling the NSE investors, BSE has said it will file a prospectus for an IPO within six to nine months as it aims to list by next year, probably on the NSE. Tensions between the NSE and the five investors go back to at least the middle of last year, but the acrimony has intensified this year, letters and emails between these shareholders and the NSE show. In February, the NSE sent minutes from a meeting to its shareholders, saying “all shareholders welcomed” developments such as the creation of a listing committee, according to a copy of the minutes seen by Reuters. It also said there were “no conceptual issues against” a planned restructuring that would create a separate holding company to oversee operations, the minutes show. The minutes prompted an angry response from the investors. In the March 7 letter, they said the minutes “misrepresent the true proceedings and discussions”. SAIF Managing Partner Ravi Adusumalli said his fund was ready to call for a replacement of management as well as the board if the exchange does not push for an IPO this year. “We have been extremely reasonable for years now and have tried to work with management,” said Adusumalli. “But we have run out of patience.”  ($1 = 67.2425 Indian rupees) ",5202016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-nse/some-foreign-investors-target-indias-top-bourse-in-rare-shareholder-backlash-idUSKCN0YB0MZ

1067,BLK,MOVES-BlackRock moving longtime ETF sales executive to stock-picking business,"NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - Daniel Gamba, a senior iShares executive who helped broaden the market for exchange-traded funds at parent company BlackRock Inc, is to move to the stock picking side of the business, according to a memo seen by Reuters. Gamba, a more than 15 year veteran at the company, will become global head of active equity product strategy, according to the memo. Active equity is the BlackRock business with portfolio managers who pick stocks. The move comes days after the world’s largest asset manager announced that it recruited Mark Wiseman, the head of Canada’s biggest public pension fund. Wiseman will oversee the stock-picking team’s operations when he joins in September as head of BlackRock’s Global Active Equity business. The team includes some 350 portfolio managers and other staff responsible for $275 billion in investments. New York-based BlackRock managed $4.7 trillion on March 31. Its leaders face the challenge of reinvigorating the stock-picking business, including the potential growth of ETFs that do not simply copy market indexes. Index-based ETFs sold by BlackRock’s iShares unit have been a booming business for the company, and an estimated third of the $2 trillion in U.S. ETF assets come from institutions. Gamba is credited with expanding demand for ETFs among BlackRock’s rival asset managers, pensions and other large groups. Two institutional sales deputies, Hilary Corman and Ravi Goutam, will take over as interim co-leaders of the iShares institutional business, the memo said. Markets and a trend toward low-cost passive investing have conspired to make the business of managing and selling actively managed stock funds a zero-sum game. BlackRock’s relative investment performance slipped last quarter, according to its own metrics. In a bid to boost its performance, BlackRock has scoured the industry for top managers and invested in technology, as well as what it calls a “scientific” active equity business, which mines reams of data for insight on which stocks to pick. During a reshuffling announced in January, BlackRock combined the previously separate scientific and a more traditional “fundamental” team after the departures of their two prior leaders.

1068,BLK,BlackRock CEO says he is 'nervous' about Europe ahead of Brexit vote,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Laurence Fink on Tuesday said he was “nervous” about Europe ahead of a June referendum on whether Britain should remain in European Union. Fink called for more leadership from Germany to invest in the Europe’s future and said he expects the region to look “quite different” within the next decade. “It may be better, it may be worse,” he said. “I’m nervous about Europe.” In a wide-ranging interview at an investor conference organized by Deutsche Bank AG, he also said he was worried that China’s use of bank and insurer balance sheets to fund inefficient state-owned enterprises could be dangerous. But Fink said the Chinese government was among the world’s best in terms of responding to its economic challenges, and he faulted developed democracies with failing to invest sufficiently in infrastructure and other investments in the future. Fink also said he expects a larger move to index-based, “passive” investing and more “consolidation” in the asset-management industry, a reference to potential mergers-and-acquisition activity. He said such moves could be among the less-appreciated consequences of a push by U.S. federal regulators to raise the standards of care to which retail financial advisers are held. The U.S. Department of Labor in April introduced new rules governing the advice given on retirement-savings accounts, but Fink said such practices could eventually become a broader industry standard. Traditional asset managers have been faced with an increasingly fierce rivalry from low-cost index funds and tough markets that have made it difficult to post competitive performance.

1076,BLK,UPDATE 1-Oilfield service firm Seventy Seven Energy files for bankruptcy,"(Adds details about Seventy Seven’s retirement plan exposure to Chesapeake Energy shares, paragraphs 3-4) By Tom Hals June 7 (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Seventy Seven Energy Inc filed for a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday to carry out a plan to convert $1.1 billion of its debt into equity in a reorganized company. Seventy Seven offers drilling and hydraulic fracturing services and was spun out of Chesapeake Energy Corp in 2014. Several months after the spinoff, about 5,200 participants in Seventy Seven’s retirement plan had $54.5 million, or about one-third of their investments, in Chesapeake shares, according to the 2014 annual report for the plan. Since the end of 2014, Chesapeake shares have dropped 76 percent, trading on Tuesday afternoon at $4.70 on the New York Stock Exchange. The slide in oil prices this year, which have plumbed their lowest levels in over a decade, has wiped out several billion dollars of retirement wealth in the energy sector in the past year. The losses may prove temporary for companies that successfully navigate the crisis, but tens of thousands of employees of struggling firms may see much of their nest eggs gone for good. Meanwhile, Seventy Seven said its creditors have already voted overwhelmingly in favor its plan, a process known as a prepackaged bankruptcy. “The successful completion of the solicitation process and today’s filing represent the next step forward in our financial restructuring,” Chief Executive Officer Jerry Winchester said. The bankruptcy comes as two years of depressed energy prices have forced scores of oil-and-gas producers into bankruptcy. Oil industry service companies have also suffered and on Monday contract drilling company Hercules Offshore Inc filed its second bankruptcy in a year. Oklahoma City-based Seventy Seven said its suppliers would be paid in full and operational contracts will remain in place. The company listed assets of $1.7 billion and debts of $1.8 billion, as of April 30, in documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. The company will seek to borrow up to $100 million to help finance operations during the bankruptcy, according to court documents. The two largest shareholders of Seventy Seven are Icahn Capital LP and BlackRock Inc, with stakes of 8.1 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, according to court filings. The company’s plan would cancel its existing stock, which was up slightly at 7 cents in midday trade over the counter.

1080,BLK,BlackRock's Rieder buying U.S. Treasuries despite rate risks,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Top BlackRock Inc investor Rick Rieder said on Tuesday he has been building up a stake in U.S. government debt even with the potential of an interest rate hike as early as July. Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at the world’s largest asset management company, told Reuters he has been adding exposure to 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities over the last month. Yields on U.S. Treasuries are still higher than on many non-U.S. bonds, he said in an interview. “Half the market is at negative interest rates. In a world of negative yield, U.S. 10 years look like a steal.” Rieder said markets have possibly underestimated the potential for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates in July, a move that would trim bonds’ value. But Rieder puts the odds of such a hike at 20 to 25 percent. “I think she’s going to keep July on the table,” Rieder said of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, noting that such a move would require strong employment numbers and no major disruptions from the June 23 British referendum on its European Union membership. But the Fed will struggle to engineer even one or two rate hikes this year, he said, in part because momentum in the labor market has slowed. U.S. economic data on Tuesday showed strong retail sales growth in May while a separate report showed a build-up of inflation pressures as import prices recorded their largest increase in just over four years. The data could influence Fed officials, who are gathering for two-day meeting which began on Tuesday, to tighten credit faster. New York-based BlackRock oversaw $1.5 trillion in fixed-income assets as of March 31. In addition to his role as chief investment officer for fixed income, Rieder manages assets that include the $29 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund .

1086,BLK,"When BlackRock calls, CEOs listen and do deals","NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is using its access and leverage as a major shareholder in public companies to strike more client-winning deals with private companies, a top executive for the world’s largest asset manager said on Friday. Because of its $1.1 trillion iShares exchange-traded funds business, where portfolios are designed to track market indexes, BlackRock holds a large position in most major U.S.-listed companies. Such a pervasive presence means that private companies, particularly those that harbor ambitions to go public and would like BlackRock as an investor, listen when the money manager pitches them a deal for a loan or an equity stake on behalf of its clients. “There is no CEO that doesn’t return our call because typically we’re up high on the shareholder register,” Mark McCombe, global head of BlackRock’s institutional client business, told Reuters reporters and editors attending the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit on Friday. “We are everybody’s largest shareholder.” Over the last year, McCombe’s team has been ramping up efforts to use that access to land more high-octane private credit and equity deals for clients that in the past might have used banks and boutique “alternative” investment managers. McCombe said BlackRock’s push into the alternatives space, which includes investments in real estate and infrastructure, is “indirectly related” to banks pulling back from this type of business. Regulations introduced since the financial crisis, such as the Volcker Rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, have put restrictions on the ability of banks to make big bets with their own money investing in these sort of assets. Many banks have since backed away, paving the way for new entrants. McCombe offered as an example of this approach the joint $900 million stake his company and U.S. private equity company First Reserve took in a Mexican natural-gas pipeline project. The deal would not have been possible without BlackRock’s relationship with Pemex, the state-controlled oil company, McCombe said at the Summit, held at the Reuters office in New York. The BlackRock “alternatives” unit - for which McCombe serves as a co-head - includes ventures ranging from hedge funds to private equity and infrastructure projects. It is a small unit for the company - accounting for just 3 percent of BlackRock’s $4.4 trillion in “long-term” assets, excluding cash accounts. But alternatives punch above their weight, drawing 8 percent of BlackRock’s fees, according to its latest quarterly earnings release. The New York-based BlackRock faces stiff competition in these alternative markets from private-equity funds, banks and other asset managers with longer-standing presences in those assets and international markets.

1087,BLK,Brexit could boost Europe's populist politicians: BlackRock executive,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - If Britain votes to leave the European Union next week the decision could accelerate the rise of populist political parties across the continent, a top executive at BlackRock (BLK.N), the world’s largest money manager, said on Friday. The vote, scheduled for next Thursday, is unnerving investors and adding to their concern about the spread of divisive political rhetoric including in the United States, where Donald Trump has effectively won the Republican presidential nomination with controversial policies including calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Mark McCombe, who runs BlackRock’s institutional client business, told the Reuters Wealth Management Summit in New York that if Britain votes to exit the EU, known as “Brexit”, it could provide a boost for anti-immigration parties in Europe.  “My own view ... is that actually there is a lot of pent-up frustration with Europe, within some of the key countries, and that actually we’ve seen it with Austria, and Germany and France and so forth, and the rise of these parties, I think it will only strengthen their resolve.” Indeed, emboldened by a surge in voter support and Britain’s looming EU referendum, Europe’s leading far-right parties pledged on Friday to work towards a “Patriotic Spring” that would roll back EU powers and halt an influx of Middle East refugees. McCombe, who is British, said it was impossible to predict the result but that if it was a tight vote to remain in the EU, UK Prime Minister David Cameron could lose his job. “If it is ‘remain’ by 50.1 percent, I don’t know if Cameron survives,” he said, adding that the prime minister’s decision to hold a referendum had been a “massive own-goal”. Investors are bracing for volatile trading conditions, and particularly the prospect of sharp one-off moves in sterling GBP=D4, after the vote. McCombe said European equities would also come under pressure if Britons chose Brexit. “Which analyst in their right mind will say, ‘oh this (a Brexit) is good news for Volkswagen’? I can’t see that scenario,” he said at the Summit, held at the Reuters office in New York. Political risk is just one headwind for McCombe’s clients, including pension funds and insurers. They are also facing persistently low yields and slower global growth. But he said that in the coming week he and his team would stay close to their UK clients and had scheduled a bunch of calls with them for the day after the vote.

1093,BLK,BlackRock's Rieder sees Fed likely on hold after June jobs data,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top bond manager at BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, said on Friday the Federal Reserve would likely leave U.S. interest rates alone for the rest of 2016 despite a surprisingly strong rebound in domestic hiring in June. Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said the bigger-than-expected 287,000 gain in payrolls in June, the biggest in eight months, was not enough to alter his outlook that U.S. jobs growth would cool as the earlier strong pace of gains is unsustainable and corporate profits will likely weaken. Global risks including the fallout from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and the likelihood of more monetary stimulus from overseas central banks will also likely keep the Fed from raising rates this year, he said. “The Fed might do one hike this year, but likely won’t be able to do that one given global economic, geopolitical, and competitive monetary policy dynamics,” Rieder said in a statement.

1096,BLK,Brexit to trigger UK recession over coming year: BlackRock,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will fall into recession over the coming year and growth in each of the next five years will be at least 0.5 percentage points lower as a result of Britain leaving the European Union, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) said on Tuesday.  “Our base case is we will have a recession,” Richard Turnill, chief investment strategist at the world’s largest asset manager, told reporters at the firm’s investment outlook briefing. “There’s likely to be a significant reduction of investment in the UK,” he said, adding that Brexit will ensure political and economic uncertainty remains high. Turnill and his colleagues expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates to zero this week from the current all-time low of 0.5 percent, and expand its quantitative easing bond-buying program next month. “The market is not entirely priced for that yet,” said Scott Thiel, BlackRock’s deputy CIO and head of global bonds. This means sterling will fall further, although not as low as parity against the dollar unless in “extreme circumstances”. The BoE will resume buying gilts before dipping its toes back into the corporate bond market, Thiel said, noting the European Central Bank’s success in narrowing corporate bond spreads through its bond purchases in that market. Sterling hit a 31-year low of $1.2796 last week, down around 15 percent since the June 23 referendum although it has since clawed back some ground against the dollar and the euro. New York-based BlackRock oversaw $4.7 trillion in assets globally as of March 31. Of that, $1.5 trillion was in fixed income assets. The Brexit fallout will result in “materially lower” growth in the euro zone as investment plans are deferred, and have a “moderately” negative impact on U.S. and Asian growth, Turnill said. Overall, BlackRock expects global investment returns to remain low across all asset classes thanks to more QE from the BoE, ECB and Bank of Japan, and the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates lower for longer than previously expected. In a low-yielding environment, they favor emerging market bonds, developed market investment-grade corporate debt, and selected bank debt in the euro zone’s periphery countries. Equities are also a good bet even though Wall Street is trading at its highest levels ever, with easy global monetary policy continuing to support prices. The dividend yield on global stocks is currently around 2.6 percent, an attractive proposition compared to ultra-low and even negative bond yields, said Charles Prideaux, BlackRock’s head of active investments, EMEA.

ICI said investors added $2 billion to U.S.-based funds invested in developed-market stocks outside the country during the week ended July 6, after pulling $2.7 billion from the funds the week before in the funds’ worst rout since 2011. The funds, invested in the United Kingdom, Germany and other advanced economies, have not pulled in that much money since the week that ended Feb. 24. U.S.-based junk-bond funds stanched withdrawals, taking in $82 million one week after investors wiped $3.4 billion from the funds’ ledgers in their biggest weekly outflows this year, according to ICI. The week before, investors took the most money overall out of U.S.-based stock and bond mutual funds this year following the British vote to leave the European Union, launching a process called “Brexit.” “Equity investors are facing tough tradeoffs and decided to buy where there were temporary discounts caused by Brexit,” said Matt Cody, co-chair of the investment committee at Wetherby Asset Management in New York. He said investors have the choice of investing in stocks after the S&P; 500 hit a record high for the third consecutive day on Wednesday or buying bonds when the 10-year Treasury’s yield is near record lows. Overall, U.S.-based equity funds recorded withdrawals of $3.1 billion during the week, while bond funds attracted $1.3 billion, according to ICI, a fund trade group. Domestic stock funds more than doubled their outflows from the week prior, to $4.5 billion, adding to a brutal year for mutual-fund managers who specialize in picking U.S. stocks.  Even as investors from BlackRock Inc to DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach said they favored some buying in emerging markets, funds specializing in those stocks posted $610 million in outflows during the week. Global-bond funds posted $142 million in outflows, ICI data showed. “We are completely out of global debt; we don’t believe paying governments to lend them money is a good investment plan for our clients,” said Cody. “You can still get positive yield in emerging debt, but energy-price weakness and increasing sovereign-debt loads lead to risks outweighing the benefits.” ",7132016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-mutualfunds-ici/u-s-fund-investors-tiptoe-back-into-junk-bonds-global-stocks-idUSL1N19Z13S
1101,BLK,BlackRock profit falls as shift from stocks hits fee revenue,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s profit fell 3.7 percent in the second quarter as global market turmoil spurred investors to shift from stocks to cash and bonds, hurting fee income at the world’s largest asset management company. New York-based BlackRock said on Thursday the revenue it takes in from fees for managing money and lending out securities fell 1.8 percent to $2.49 billion from the same period a year ago, even as the total assets it manages rose to nearly $5 trillion. On June 23, Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union briefly sent the financial markets into a tailspin. BlackRock’s second quarter ended June 30. “Equity markets have rebounded a lot,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in an interview. “We have a lot of wind at our back today.” BlackRock’s net income fell to $789 million, or $4.73 per share, from $819 million, or $4.84 per share, a year earlier. Revenue was down 3.5 percent, to $2.8 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $4.78 per share, roughly in line with the average analyst’s estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Even so, BlackRock shares slipped 0.6 percent to $355.19, compared with a gain of about 0.8 percent by its peers in a Dow Jones index tracking U.S. asset managers. Analysts said sales of BlackRock funds were lower than they had expected. BlackRock attracted $1.54 billion in “long-term” net flows in the second quarter, compared with outflows of $7.30 billion in the year-earlier quarter. “The environment is just that challenging,” said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders, who nonetheless rates the stock a ‘buy’. “People are accustomed to pretty good growth numbers and they didn’t get that this quarter.” Money that shifted aggressively into bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helped, accounting for about two-thirds of the $15.67 billion in new cash that moved into the iShares ETF business, up from $10.85 billion a year earlier. BlackRock’s overall assets under management rose to $4.890 trillion from $4.721 trillion a year earlier. But those strong sales of bond ETFs were offset by the results in its actively managed business, where portfolio managers work to beat the markets. Active outflows totaled $12.8 billion in the quarter. A key focus for BlackRock has been boosting performance in its active stockpicking business, which generates higher fees than index-tracking ETFs. The company has focused on integrating new stock fund managers and boosting team performances. During a reshuffling announced in January, Fink and BlackRock President Rob Kapito combined the “scientific” and more traditional “fundamental” stock team under four managers. In May, BlackRock revealed it recruited Mark Wiseman, the head of Canada’s biggest public pension fund, to oversee its stockpicking operations. BlackRock’s Fink described the performance of the active stockpicking strategies as “a mixed bag.” About 63 percent of assets in the company’s “fundamental” active equity business outperformed over the last year, BlackRock said, while the “scientific” team’s figure was 40 percent. That group mines reams of data for insights on how to pick stocks. Inflows of $5.5 billion to fixed-income products and $1.4 billion into higher fee “alternatives” such as hedge funds helped offset $2.2 billion in withdrawals from equity strategies, and $3.1 billion that moved out of strategies that invest across many assets.

That group mines reams of data for insights on how to pick stocks. Inflows of $5.5 billion to fixed-income products and $1.4 billion into higher fee “alternatives” such as hedge funds helped offset $2.2 billion in withdrawals from equity strategies, and $3.1 billion that moved out of strategies that invest across many assets.

1103,BLK,BlackRock stock buybacks continue though CEO warned against repurchases,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) has been buying roughly $275 million of its shares every quarter, a practice chief executive Larry Fink said could continue even though he has previously warned about the downside of share repurchases. Buybacks can boost earnings per share figures because the practice lowers the number of shares on issue and in the past Fink has said that executives have relied too much on buybacks and dividend increases rather than making long-term investments. On Thursday, Fink defended BlackRock’s buybacks and dividends, arguing they are aligned with the company’s long-term goals and a prudent use of excess capital. The company raised its dividend 5.0 percent last quarter from the year prior. “Our policies have not changed in years - we’ve been as consistent as anybody,” Fink told Reuters. “Where we have excess capital, we redistribute that back.” Buybacks have been a significant force in the S&P; 500 stock index's .SPX rise to record highs in recent years. Companies in that index bought back $161 billion of their stock in the first quarter of this year, the second-largest figure on record, according to S&P; Dow Jones Indices, though announcements of upcoming buybacks has slowed. [nL1N19J0V2] As a champion of what he calls “long-termism,” Fink has criticized executives for their use share-boosting measures to pacify activist investors. “We certainly support returning excess cash to shareholders, but not at the expense of value-creating investment,” Fink said in a letter this year to company executives. Last year, he said some executives have under-invested in “innovation, skilled workforces or essential capital expenditures necessary to sustain long-term growth.” [nL2N0XB28O] As the world’s largest asset manager, New York-based BlackRock is a top shareholder of public companies.

1107,BLK,Distressed funds set for big stakes in Gulf Keystone after debt swap,"LONDON (Reuters) - Distressed debt funds will become big shareholders in troubled oil firm Gulf Keystone (GKP.L) after bondholders agreed to swap $500 million of debt for equity, wiping out some of the world’s top funds as shareholders. Gulf Keystone operates the giant Shaikan oil field in Iraqi Kurdistan and produces about 40,000 barrels per day (bpd). The firm has been fighting to avoid insolvency after low oil prices and overdue oil export payments from the Kurdistan regional government crippled its balance sheet. But the deal will also set the stage for a battle for control if its new shareholders decide to offload their stakes to a new strategic investor, which Gulf Keystone has been seeking. Shares in London-listed Gulf Keystone plunged more than 30 percent on the news. The company said current shareholders, which include Capital Group, Prudential (PRU.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and BlackRock (BLK.N) would see their ownership diluted to 5 percent. Sothic Capital, a London-based fund led by former distressed specialists from JP Morgan, is among the bondholders that will end up with a significant stake, according to sources close to the company and bondholders. Other such bondholders are GLG Partners, part of hedge fund Man Group, and investment fund Taconic Capital.  Sothic did not respond to telephone calls. GLG and Taconic were not available for immediate comment. “This is obviously negative in share price terms given the significant dilution, although it’s an expected and necessary step to allow the company to continue trading on a far steadier footing,” said analysts at Cenkos Natural Resources. Gulf Keystone said it had received as many as 18 M&A; deal proposals, ranging from farm-ins to full sales, but that political problems in Iraq and uncertainty about oil prices had blocked progress. U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) several years ago showed interest in making an offer, Gulf Keystone’s former chairman told Reuters last year. After the bond swap is completed, Gulf Keystone’s debt will fall to $100 million from the current $600 million of guaranteed and convertible bonds maturing in 2017, making it a much more attractive acquisition target. The company will use some of the extra cash it hopes to raise via a $20-$25 million new equity issue to increase production to 55,000 bpd from around 40,000 currently. The Shaikan oil field has proven and probable reserves of 639 million barrels. For some of the new shareholders, the debt swap could be a real coup. Gulf Keystone’s $250 million guaranteed notes XS1056559088 traded below 50 cents to the dollar between January and April, Thomson Reuters data showed. This means investors could have bought the debt for less than $125 million. The holders of the $250 million guaranteed bond will retain $100 million of reinstated notes and receive 65.5 percent of Gulf Keystone’s equity. Sources close to the company said, however, they had not registered a major change in bondholders over the past year. “The new owners are really a mixed bag of investors. They are distressed specialists but also long-only funds,” said one source, who asked not to be identified. As a result of the proposed restructuring, the owners of $325 million in convertible bonds will receive 20 percent ownership of Gulf Keystone.  Gulf Keystone said Capital Group, one of the world’s biggest funds, was supporting the restructuring. It could end up with 10-15 percent of the firm by retaining its shares and subscribing to the new issue. With a market value of $3 billion in its heyday four years ago, Gulf Keystone is currently worth around $60 million. If the debt swap deal breaks down, the company would likely become insolvent, the firm said in a statement.

1118,BLK,BlackRock's voting record clashes with CEO's tough talk on buybacks,"BOSTON (Reuters) - When Adam Kanzer wanted to stop the board of 3M Co (MMM.N) from including the lucrative impact of share buybacks in their chief executive’s pay, he quoted Laurence Fink. Sitting atop the world’s largest investment fund manager, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Fink is a vocal critic of companies’ excessive use of share buybacks. The practice is happening at a rapid clip among S&P; 500 companies and according to critics is helping boost shareholder returns – and bosses’ pay – to the detriment of long-term growth. Kanzer, who is managing director of Domini Social Investments, channeled Fink at the top of his firm’s resolution to the 3M (MMM.N) board, quoting his warning that large buybacks send “a discouraging message about a company’s ability to use its resources wisely.” It didn’t help. The resolution failed with 94 percent of shares cast voting against it. Shares held by BlackRock, 3M’s third-largest investor with a 5.7 percent stake in the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape, according to its proxy,  apparently were not supportive.  Despite their CEO’s strong views, funds run by BlackRock side with company management on questions tied to stock buybacks most of the time, according to filings analyzed by research firm Proxy Insight for Reuters. BlackRock is not alone. Large asset managers like Fidelity Investments and State Street Corp (STT.N) have a similar voting record on the matter, according to the analysis. But Fink’s exhortations and BlackRock’s size make its voting record stand out. In the last three years, Fink has made his concerns about buybacks a top theme of an annual letter to other CEOs stressing the importance of companies investing for the long term. His views have been carried widely in the financial press and echoed by U.S. presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. BlackRock’s nearly $5 trillion in managed assets mean that it is often a top investor in many of the companies buying back their shares, giving it an outsize voice on whether that strategy is the right one. “Larry Fink’s letters demonstrate that leadership. We hope it’s not all posturing,” said Brandon Rees deputy director of the office of investment for the AFL-CIO, of Fink’s efforts. The AFL-CIO is the largest federation of U.S. labor unions and sponsored a resolution at Illinois Tool Works (ITW.N) that, like Domini’s 3M resolution, called on the company to exclude the impact of share repurchases from executive pay calculations. The resolution failed, with 95 percent of votes cast against it. It is unclear if BlackRock, a top five investor in the equipment maker, voted for it. The company does not comment on how it votes or its engagement with individual companies, and public filings showing its votes are not yet available.  Rees said while he admires Fink’s sentiments, BlackRock does not release enough detail to fully evaluate whether BlackRock’s  engagement with particular companies has much impact. Fink, who was not made available to comment on this story, does not think all buybacks are bad. Some may be a prudent use of excess capital, and BlackRock itself has been buying roughly $275 million of its own shares every quarter, he has said. Spokesman Ed Sweeney said when BlackRock has concerns about a company’s direction or corporate governance, it meets with directors and executives privately to “catalyze positive changes,” and votes against management when talks fail. He added that capital allocation matters like buybacks are just one of many areas it considers in its proxy voting process. In one case, BlackRock withheld support from two directors at “a large oil and gas corporation” this spring after the company — which it declined to name — did not make board members available to explain their strategy and capital allocation decisions, according to its website.  It also did not support a member of Discovery Communications Inc’s (DISCA.O) compensation committee last year after the company awarded its CEO the largest pay package in the S&P; 500, according to securities filings. To guide those decisions, BlackRock turns to a team of 22 people who determine how to vote on thousands of ballot items each year at U.S. companies’ annual meetings. Sweeney said that this division, headed by Michelle Edkins, is independent and votes in accordance with, “our fiduciary duty to our clients.” BlackRock did not make Edkins available to comment. Matthew Weatherley-White, managing director of investment adviser Caprock Group, said BlackRock cannot vote too aggressively because many clients would not share Fink’s views. For instance, choosing to buy back shares can boost shareholder returns in the short-term because it raises earnings per share. “Fink is sincere, but structurally they have a hard time following through,” Weatherley-White said. S&P; 500 firms are purchasing $445 billion in stock over the last 12 months of earnings reports, matching the previous year’s peak. Add in dividends, and the total of $838 billion spent surpasses total capital expenditures of $707 billion in that time, according to a Reuters analysis Much of BlackRock’s nearly $5 trillion in managed assets is in passive investment products that buy and hold stocks only because they are in a particular index. That means that proxy votes are one of the few ways of expressing displeasure with a company. Actively managed funds can sell a company’s stock anytime they become dissatisfied. “As an index fund owner, you have to own some really crummy companies” that happen to be in an index, Fink said at an investor conference two years ago. The “only power you have is your vote,” he said. But BlackRock rarely exercised that power. In last year’s proxy season, BlackRock funds opposed five percent of resolutions to approve share buybacks or repurchases, according to Proxy Insight’s analysis for Reuters. To be sure, that was a stronger record than some rivals like Vanguard Group or T. Rowe Price (TROW.O), which opposed the resolutions one percent of the time and 2.7 percent of the time, respectively. Both T. Rowe Price and Vanguard declined to comment. BlackRock’s Global Opportunities Fund MDLOX.N, for instance, opposed management on just two of 85 resolutions in that period, including at construction firm Bouygues SA (BOUY.PA) and distiller Remy Cointreau (RCOP.PA). BlackRock’s Sweeney declined to discuss the votes, but proxy adviser Glass, Lewis had recommended against both measures on concerns they could be used to thwart takeover attempts. Filings analyzed by Proxy Insight for Reuters also show that of the 30 S&P; 500 companies that bought back the highest proportion of their stock in 2014, funds run by BlackRock supported those companies’ directors about 97 percent of the time the following year, the most recent period available. That is roughly as often as they supported S&P; 500 directors overall. Public filings showing BlackRock’s votes on specific directors and shareholder proposals this year are not yet available, including Kanzer’s 3M resolution on buybacks. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services did not support the change at 3M or at Illinois Tool, which is a blow since backing from ISS can add an extra 30 percentage points or so to the support level for a typical shareholder proposal, according to pay consulting firm Semler Brossy.  But Kanzer was counting on Fink’s BlackRock to back him up. “Considering the helpful things Larry Fink has been saying about excessive share buybacks, we had hoped to see BlackRock underscore that message through its proxy voting,” said Kanzer of Domini Social Investments, an investment adviser that specializes in socially responsible investing and sponsored the 3M resolution. Kanzer noted that his resolution at least prompted 3M to offer more disclosure around its rationale for the buybacks, and said he had a “productive conversation” with 3M management.  Will Domini re-submit similar resolutions at 3M and elsewhere next year? “Still thinking about it,” he said.

1122,BLK,"BlackRock's largest mutual fund warns on U.S., ups Japan stake","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Managers of BlackRock Inc’s largest mutual fund are warning that U.S. stocks may “disappoint” investors, a company note showed on Wednesday, arguing for a shift to Japanese stocks as one of the few markets offering a bargain. Nearly 10 percent of the $45 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund was made up of Japanese stocks, as of July 29, about double the 5 percent held by its benchmark, a BlackRock website showed. The fund has wide latitude to invest across stocks, bonds and other assets. “During the month of July, we added to Japanese equities as we view the reappointment of (Japanese Prime Minister) Shinzo Abe’s coalition combined with attractive valuations and corporate governance trends as a positive for risk assets in Japan,” a note from the funds’ managers said. “Looking across the broad array of asset classes globally, few are unambiguously cheap. Investors with a strong U.S. bias may become particularly disappointed.” The note argues that U.S. stocks are priced at “valuations” that are “extended by most measures,” meaning they likely are not a bargain. U.S. equities nonetheless represent nearly a third of the fund’s portfolio, consisting of stocks the note says are a good “long-term value.” The fund’s top holdings include Apple Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Marathon Petroleum Corp. By contrast, the note said Japanese equities are below their historical averages, citing an internal BlackRock analysis, and seem especially cheap compared to emerging markets, U.S. and European stocks. In U.S. dollar terms, the MSCI Japan Index is up 8.6 percent since the end of June. Abe and his ruling coalition won a landslide victory last month in an election for parliament’s upper house.

Investors with a strong U.S. bias may become particularly disappointed.” ",8172016,http://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-japan/blackrocks-largest-mutual-fund-ups-bet-on-japan-idUSL1N1AY1P9
1125,BLK,BlackRock upgrades outlook for emerging market stocks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) said on Monday it is upgrading its view on emerging market stocks, adding that the equities will continue thriving as central banks keep interest rates low. Rates globally remaining “lower for longer” keeps the risk of the U.S. dollar rising slim, while increasing the likelihood of more rate cuts by emerging market central banks, Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist for the world’s largest asset manager, said in a note. That combination makes assets in emerging markets relatively attractive, he said. Meanwhile, investors have been pumping billions into funds tracking that market. Emerging-market stock funds in the United States took in $2.7 billion in the weekly period through Aug. 17, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data, their seventh straight week reeling in cash. “We see room for further inflows,” said Turnill. BlackRock had been reluctant to raise its forecast on stocks in countries such as China and India, keeping its view “neutral” on the market for the better part of this year even as it said pressures were easing on developing countries. But Monday’s note upgraded emerging market stocks to “overweight.” That shows that BlackRock expects the equities to do well, in U.S. dollar terms, over the next three months. Turnill said BlackRock prefers investments in “countries showing economic improvements or having clear reform catalysts,” citing India and the “ASEAN” grouping of countries in Southeast Asia. New York-based BlackRock has already been “overweight” emerging-market debt since July.

1131,BLK,BlackRock withheld support from two key Exxon directors: filings,"BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc withheld support from two high-profile directors at Exxon Mobil Corp, securities filings show, a rare spat apparently driven by a board communications policy at the world’s largest energy company. Because top fund managers like BlackRock rarely discuss their votes in detail, filings in late August to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provide a rare window into the influential ballots they cast at springtime shareholder meetings like the one held by Exxon on May 25, one of this year’s more contentious. BlackRock, which manages nearly $5 trillion, has been criticized for largely supporting company managers on matters like executive pay or electing directors. BlackRock funds have backed corporate directors around 97 percent of the time since 2013, according to research firm Proxy Insight, and mostly backed Exxon at this year’s meeting such as opposing shareholder proposals addressing climate change. BlackRock executives say they prefer to press companies behind the scenes, and vote against management only when such engagement fails. But in a rare break, filings on Friday showed funds including the $45 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund withheld support from Exxon directors Jay Fishman and Kenneth Frazier this year.  Fishman, who recently passed away, had been CEO of insurer Travelers. Frazier is CEO of drugmaker Merck & Co. While spokesman for BlackRock and Exxon declined to comment, BlackRock’s reasoning for the votes appears to be spelled out in a recent governance report on its website. The report describes how BlackRock executives tried to discuss strategy and capital allocation with independent directors of an unnamed “large oil and gas corporation,” but were rebuffed because of a policy against such talks. As a result, BlackRock said it withheld support from the company’s lead independent director and the chair of the committee that set the policy. Fishman had been Exxon’s “presiding director,” meant to provide independent board leadership according to Exxon’s proxy statement, while Frazier  led its board affairs committee. The two were re-elected with 88 and 90 percent of votes cast, respectively, down from 95 and 98 percent in 2015. BlackRock is Exxon’s second-largest shareholder with about 6 percent of its stock, according to the proxy. Exxon’s other directors got no less than 95 percent support this year. How much contact independent directors should have with outsiders has become a loaded issue because of the rise of activist investors pushing disruptive agendas. Asked about BlackRock’s concern, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers cited a webpage outlining board communications procedures, which do not directly address the matter. But Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, said Exxon executives have described at meetings the sort of policy criticized by BlackRock. Filings also showed BlackRock funds did not back resolutions at 3M Co, Illinois Tool Works Inc or Xerox Corp calling on the companies to exclude the impact of share buybacks when calculating executive pay, even though the resolutions cited the concerns about buybacks raised by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.

1134,BLK,RPT-Funds leader BlackRock calls on investors to assess climate change impact,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, said all investors should factor climate change into their decision-making and doing so would not mean having to accept lower returns.        Global moves to coordinate a response to climate change took a big step forward on Saturday when both China and the United States ratified a 2015 plan to curb climate-warming emissions, raising chances it will enter into law this year.     BlackRock said it is strengthening its data and analytical processes to reflect changes to the environment - and political responses to them. In a 16-page report released after the G20 meeting in China, BlackRock, which manages more than $4.9 trillion in assets, said risks and opportunities would come through the physical effects of climate change, technological change, as well as the regulatory and social response.     “Climate risk is an enduring challenge,” Ewen Cameron Watt, senior director for BlackRock’s Investment Institute, told Reuters. “This is a source of portfolio risk and a source of social risk, which needs addressing.”     In the report, BlackRock suggested higher carbon prices could limit the cost of reducing emissions and push companies to create solutions to the problem. In the meantime, BlackRock said it was enhancing its data mining efforts to reduce the risk to its investments. For instance, they calculate emissions as a percentage of a company’s sales, estimate firms’ exposure to income shocks from rising temperatures and calculate the sales a company generates with little physical waste.     Firms that cut their carbon footprint have performed better than their peers who did not make such changes, BlackRock said.     Cameron Watt said insurers have made vast strides in recent decades to model “climate risk” in detail and adjusted their premiums accordingly.     “I think we can do the same,” he said, applying data to its own investment process. “We’re just scratching the surface.”     For instance, with more detailed number-crunching, BlackRock could learn how a single corporation’s factories and supply lines could be affected by catastrophic weather. The risks are considerable, BlackRock said. After an extreme weather event hits a state, economic growth is 10 to 15 percent lower than usual that month and slower for many more months, its analysis showed.  BlackRock has expanded its ability to store, sort and analyze data and uses more of the data to inform its investment decisions, for instance in deciding when to bet against a stock.     The information ranges from satellite images of cars in retailer parking lots to shipping trends to word searches on corporate earnings calls.

1137,BLK,MOVES-Head of BlackRock quasi-consulting arm to leave company -memo,"NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The man who since 2008 has run BlackRock Inc’s quasi-consulting arm for governments, regulators and massive financial firms plans to leave the company next year, according to an internal memo. Craig Phillips is leaving “to consider a possible transition to the public sector,” according to the memo, which was seen by Reuters. A Wall Street veteran for decades, Phillips joined the company during the apex of the global financial crisis as the once-marginal bond-focused manager became the largest company of its kind globally and found new heft and demand for its counsel in the years during and since the global financial crisis. BlackRock marshaled the unit Phillips runs - Financial Markets Advisory, or FMA - in 2008 when the company was tapped by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help manage assets and keep the financial system running smoothly. For instance, it managed troubled assets accumulated by the investment bank Bear Stearns and the insurer American International Group. In the years since, BlackRock has worked to define FMA as its own business segment and as a showcase for the asset manager’s risk controls and technology. “FMA has not only become a thriving business, it has contributed to BlackRock’s reputation in a way that truly sets us apart from other asset managers,” said the memo, which was signed by BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink and two of his senior deputies, Rob Kapito and Rob Goldstein. Phillips could not immediately be reached for comment. Among other responsibilities, Phillips headed the Client Solutions team and was a member of the BlackRock Operating Committee, a senior executive group. Charles Hatami - the co-head of the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment of BlackRock’s FMA business - will take over Phillips’ role, the memo said.

1138,BLK,Formula One faces big shake-up after Liberty deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Formula One faces its biggest shake-up in decades with the announcement on Wednesday that U.S. cable TV mogul John Malone’s Liberty Media has agreed to take control of the cash-generating glamor sport. The deal, which has an enterprise value of $8 billion according to a company statement, heralds a new era for Formula One, a European-dominated sport that has long sought to break into the U.S. market and win fresh audiences. It could also accelerate the exit of 85-year-old Bernie Ecclestone, the Briton who has run the sport for nearly 40 years and built up a business with annual turnover of around $1.9 billion. Liberty Media said in a statement, which ended a long-running saga surrounding the sport’s ownership and potential flotation, that it was acquiring an initial 18.7 percent stake from controlling shareholder CVC Capital Partners.  The company hopes to complete a deal for the remainder by the first quarter of 2017.  The statement added that Chase Carey, the executive vice-chairman of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and a director of Sky News owner Sky Plc, will take over as chairman of the board of Formula One’s parent company with Ecclestone remaining as CEO. “I greatly admire Formula One as a unique global sports entertainment franchise attracting hundreds of millions of fans each season from all around the world,” Carey said.   “I see great opportunity to help Formula One continue to develop and prosper for the benefit of the sport, fans, teams and investors alike.” Ecclestone added that he welcomed the company into the sport and looked forward to working with them.   The deal will be subject to the approval of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), the governing body for Formula One and other global motorsport series, and European anti-trust regulators. CVC acquired majority control of Formula One in March 2006 and has since recouped its money many times over with billions of dollars in revenues. DEAL-MAKER Ecclestone has been the deal-maker, securing lucrative television contracts and hosting fees with countries such as Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan that are eager to feature on what is now a calendar with a record 21 races. A controversial figure, who has become as much a celebrity as any of the drivers, ‘Bernie’ has been a part of Formula One ever since the 1950s. A former team owner, he secured the television rights in the late 1970s and transformed the sport into one of the world’s richest. Reluctant to delegate, he has not groomed a successor and critics have accused him of holding back the sport through a failure to embrace fully new media or the digital marketplace, something Liberty is expected to make a priority. “Maybe it is good news that an American media company buys F1,” Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff said at the weekend’s Italian Grand Prix. “There are things we can learn from the American way, particularly in the digital areas...they will have a close look and then analyze what they think needs to be changed and what needs to remain.”   Team bosses and other paddock insiders expect Ecclestone to be eased out only gradually, given his intimate knowledge of the business. CVC has twice tried to float Formula One but the plans stalled and the fund instead sold stakes to U.S. investment groups BlackRock and Waddell & Reed, along with Norway’s Norges Bank. It sold down its holding from 63 percent in 2012 in deals that at the time gave the business an enterprise value, which includes debt and equity, of $9.1 billion. That left CVC with a 35.5 percent stake in Delta Topco, Formula One’s parent company, with Waddell & Reed having 20.9 percent. Among other investors, Ecclestone holds 5.3 percent and his family’s Bambino Trust another 8.5 percent. Malone’s Liberty Global is the world’s largest international TV and broadband company, operating in more than 30 countries in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean through a series of different brand names.

1144,BLK,BlackRock sees $70 trillion in cash on sidelines that could boost stocks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks globally could continue to rise as interest rates remain low as investors who have stockpiled some $70 trillion in cash seek higher returns from the market, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) president Rob Kapito said on Tuesday. “People are tired of earning zero,” Kapito said at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference in New York, referencing slim returns on short-term savings and in bond markets. “There’s more cash in the system than ever before.” Kapito said some $10 trillion of the cash is effectively earning a negative yield, eroding savings, but that investors have found fewer opportunities to deploy money in the markets. Central banks have accelerated bond-buying and other efforts to stoke inflation. Kapito described his clients as “very unhappy” about earning less on their money. When they decide to put that cash to work, he said, it could be a boon for stocks despite concerns that stocks are already richly priced. Heavier stock investment could also benefit asset managers, he said, who generally earn plumper fees for managing stocks than cash. Asset managers have been battling market swings and weathering a move to often lower-cost, index-tracking funds. Kapito said that move from “active” to “passive” funds makes sense given the higher returns of many index funds, but he said the trend would reverse as asset managers boost performance and rely more on complex data analysis to generate investment ideas. New York-based BlackRock, which manages nearly $5 trillion in assets, is the world’s largest asset manager. The company manages both active and passive funds.

Arrowhead will get $35 million up front and a $21.5 million injection from Amgen that will give the world’s No. 1 biotech company by market value an equity stake of 4.5 percent.

Arrowhead, along with competitors such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc, Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc   and privately held Quark Pharmaceuticals, focuses on ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi), which aims to silence certain genes to curb the production of disease-causing proteins.  RNAi has long interested drug developers, but has frequently met with clinical failure. Existing drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, work by trying to inactivate disease-causing proteins by binding to them. The license and collaboration deal includes two agreements, under which Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen will take charge of clinical development and commercialization. Under the first agreement, Amgen will get an exclusive global license to Arrowhead’s ARC-LPA program, which has not been tested in humans.  The RNAi drug is designed to reduce elevated levels of a form of cholesterol called Lp(a) that raises the risk of heart disease caused by plaque build-up.

1159,BLK,"TPG, BlackRock show early interest in SriLankan Airlines stake -sources","SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Private equity firm TPG and fund company BlackRock Inc are among half a dozen firms which have shown preliminary interest in a 49 percent stake in loss-making SriLankan Airlines Ltd, people familiar with the matter said. They said Sri Lanka is looking to sell the stake along with management control in the restructuring national carrier as part of its efforts to reduce support for state-owned firms and cut government debt. In July, a unit of state-run National Savings Bank, the lead manager overseeing SriLankan Airlines’ revamp, invited offers from strategic investors who would assume responsibility for turning around the airline and its budget subsidiary Mihin Lanka. A senior Sri Lankan finance ministry official said TPG and BlackRock were the two top international firms among the bidders. He declined to be identified as the bids are still being evaluated. BlackRock and TPG declined to comment. It was not immediately clear who were the other bidders. Sources also said it was too early in the process to estimate a potential deal value. SriLankan Airlines was a profitable 10-year joint venture with Emirates Airline until the pair split in 2008. Mismanagement in the years since has left it with debt of around $3.25 billion, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said. “The government is looking at someone to solve the airline’s struggles,” said one person familiar with the matter. The person, who was not authorised to speak to the media, declined to be identified. SriLankan Airlines is due to give details of its  restructuring plan at a media event later on Wednesday. The people said government is expected to shortlist parties and pick a final bidder in the next couple of months, adding that the government has indicated it would take on a substantial portion of the debt owed by the airline. The companies are expected to start due diligence after the shortlist has been finalised. SriLankan Airlines has attractive routes to India and analysts have said potential investors could be drawn to the prospect of turning around the carrier, which has about 21 leased Airbus planes. Srilankan Airlines reported a net loss of 16.33 billion Sri Lankan rupees ($112 million) for the year to March 31, narrower than its 31.4 billion rupees a loss year earlier on lower oil prices. It last made a profit in 2009, a year after Emirates sold its stake.

1164,BLK,BlackRock CEO sees 'hostile' climate as index funds reel in cash,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, reported better-than-expected quarterly profits on Tuesday, showing resilience in what has been a punishing market for fund managers. CEO Larry Fink nonetheless told Reuters his industry faces a “hostile” environment as investors migrate to products like index funds, which typically carry lower fees than actively managed funds. Even as BlackRock absorbed $55.1 billion in cash in its core products, revenue fell 2.5 percent due to lower performance fees. A favorable tax rate and income from non-core investments helped the company beat analyst forecasts. BlackRock has managed to stand above the fray because it owns iShares, the leading exchange-traded fund brand. Still, its transition from being primarily an active asset manager to a more passive one has not been without pain. “Even in these hostile headwinds that we see as an industry, I think we will benefit over the long run,” Fink said in an interview. Most recognizable ETFs charge low fees and aim to track the market rather than beat it. BlackRock sliced fees on some ETFs further during the latest quarter to draw in new business. Investors are expected to leave funds that pay brokers sales commissions due to an upcoming U.S. Labor Department rule, and BlackRock has said its ETFs can benefit. Overall, the company’s net income rose 3.8 percent to $875 million, or $5.26 per share, in the third quarter from $843 million, or $5.00 per share, a year earlier. After adjustments to strip out some compensation, distribution and tax costs, BlackRock said it earned $5.14 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $5.00, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At Sept. 30, the bond and index fund manager had $5.1 trillion in assets under management. BlackRock’s iShares ETF business took in $51 billion in new money - more than double its inflows a year ago. It accounted for 93 percent of the cash the company took into its long-term funds, a grouping that excludes short-term cash accounts. So far this year, investors have pulled $110 billion from U.S.-based stock funds, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. “Active” funds, whose managers bet on specific stocks and bonds, have lost $119 billion to cash withdrawals this year in the United States, according to Morningstar Inc (MORN.O). “The whole industry is feeling that,” Fink said. BlackRock’s own active performance remains a source of concern and diminished revenue, even as it took in new money last quarter. The company attracted $37 billion into long-term fixed income investments and $13 billion in equities. Another $1.8 billion went into alternative investments, while its stock and bond-picking franchise took in $4 billion. Yet BlackRock’s performance fees - which are usually earned when a fund beats its target return - fell by 72 percent in the quarter. Institutional clients withdrew money from one of its key stockpicking groups, known as “scientific” active equity, as performance has lagged over the past year. Just 31 percent of assets managed by that unit are beating their benchmark over the period, BlackRock said. “Actively managed equity funds generate the highest revenues,” said CFRA Research analyst Erik Oja. “Clearly it’s a long-term downward trend for that.” But analysts say index funds may be the future. BlackRock’s iShares business includes some relatively inexpensive “Core” ETFs that track markets, as well as pricier ones, branded “Edge,” that attempt to copy and automate successful techniques used by active managers. One such product, iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV) (USMV.P), has been a bestseller since it launched five years ago, even though other stock funds have been out of favor with investors. It aims to deliver market returns with fewer price swings, a claim that appears to be substantiated so far by Lipper performance data. “We feel like there will be more and more adoption,” said Rob Nestor, a BlackRock managing director who oversees USMV and other so-called “smart beta” strategies in the United States. He noted that it has become more difficult for active managers to beat market returns. Meanwhile, Aladdin, a risk-management technology BlackRock uses and licenses to other investment firms, reported a 13 percent rise in revenue. BlackRock shares rose about 0.6 percent on Tuesday afternoon in New York.

1165,BLK,UPDATE 4-BlackRock CEO sees 'hostile' climate as index funds reel in cash,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, reported better-than-expected quarterly profits on Tuesday, showing resilience in what has been a punishing market for fund managers. CEO Larry Fink nonetheless told Reuters his industry faces a “hostile” environment as investors migrate to products like index funds, which typically carry lower fees than actively managed funds. Even as BlackRock absorbed $55.1 billion in cash in its core products, revenue fell 2.5 percent due to lower performance fees. A favorable tax rate and income from non-core investments helped the company beat analyst forecasts. BlackRock has managed to stand above the fray because it owns iShares, the leading exchange-traded fund brand. Still, its transition from being primarily an active asset manager to a more passive one has not been without pain. “Even in these hostile headwinds that we see as an industry, I think we will benefit over the long run,” Fink said in an interview. Most recognizable ETFs charge low fees and aim to track the market rather than beat it. BlackRock sliced fees on some ETFs further during the latest quarter to draw in new business. Investors are expected to leave funds that pay brokers sales commissions due to an upcoming U.S. Labor Department rule, and BlackRock has said its ETFs can benefit. Overall, the company’s net income rose 3.8 percent to $875 million, or $5.26 per share, in the third quarter from $843 million, or $5.00 per share, a year earlier. After adjustments to strip out some compensation, distribution and tax costs, BlackRock said it earned $5.14 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $5.00, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At Sept. 30, the bond and index fund manager had $5.1 trillion in assets under management. BlackRock’s iShares ETF business took in $51 billion in new money - more than double its inflows a year ago. It accounted for 93 percent of the cash the company took into its long-term funds, a grouping that excludes short-term cash accounts. So far this year, investors have pulled $110 billion from U.S.-based stock funds, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. “Active” funds, whose managers bet on specific stocks and bonds, have lost $119 billion to cash withdrawals this year in the United States, according to Morningstar Inc (MORN.O). “The whole industry is feeling that,” Fink said. BlackRock’s own active performance remains a source of concern and diminished revenue, even as it took in new money last quarter. The company attracted $37 billion into long-term fixed income investments and $13 billion in equities. Another $1.8 billion went into alternative investments, while its stock and bond-picking franchise took in $4 billion. Yet BlackRock’s performance fees - which are usually earned when a fund beats its target return - fell by 72 percent in the quarter. Institutional clients withdrew money from one of its key stockpicking groups, known as “scientific” active equity, as performance has lagged over the past year. Just 31 percent of assets managed by that unit are beating their benchmark over the period, BlackRock said. “Actively managed equity funds generate the highest revenues,” said CFRA Research analyst Erik Oja. “Clearly it’s a long-term downward trend for that.” But analysts say index funds may be the future. BlackRock’s iShares business includes some relatively inexpensive “Core” ETFs that track markets, as well as pricier ones, branded “Edge,” that attempt to copy and automate successful techniques used by active managers. One such product, iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV) (USMV.P), has been a bestseller since it launched five years ago, even though other stock funds have been out of favor with investors. It aims to deliver market returns with fewer price swings, a claim that appears to be substantiated so far by Lipper performance data. “We feel like there will be more and more adoption,” said Rob Nestor, a BlackRock managing director who oversees USMV and other so-called “smart beta” strategies in the United States. He noted that it has become more difficult for active managers to beat market returns. Meanwhile, Aladdin, a risk-management technology BlackRock uses and licenses to other investment firms, reported a 13 percent rise in revenue. BlackRock shares rose about 0.6 percent on Tuesday afternoon in New York.

1171,BLK,BlackRock attracts $5 billion to lowest-cost ETFs after price cut,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc has attracted nearly $5 billion to its lowest-cost segment of exchange-traded funds since it announced a price cut last month aimed at financial advisers, the company said on Tuesday. The world’s largest asset manager on Oct. 5 said it was lowering fees on 15 funds in its “Core” U.S. iShares ETF lineup. It touted the move as a boon for financial advisers and brokers, who will soon be governed by Labor Department regulations seen favoring inexpensive investments. The change affected about a quarter of the nearly $1 trillion held in iShares’ U.S. ETFs, bringing fees down by 2 to 5 hundredths of one percent. BlackRock disclosed the latest sales figure while announcing more changes to the Core lineup that include adding a bond fund and a real-estate fund that will each charge 0.08 percent annually, or $8 for every $10,000 managed. “Our aim is always going to be to provide the highest quality exposures at the best value in the marketplace,” said Martin Small, BlackRock’s U.S. head of iShares. The ETFs - iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF - are scheduled to start trading on Thursday. They replace two bond ETFs that were removed from the Core slate earlier in October. A rule announced by the Labor Department in April and effective next year sets a so-called fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products, requiring them to put clients’ best interests ahead of their own bottom line. The language in the new rule is tougher than existing rules that require brokers only to ensure products are “suitable.” BlackRock’s iShares unit has faced intense competition from rivals, including Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp. Both came later to the ETF business and have been quick to cut costs. The average Vanguard stock ETF charges 0.09 percent, compared with Schwab’s 0.18 percent and iShares’ 0.40 percent, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper, a research service. Yet all three are profiting as investors have moved money from “active” stock-picking managers to index funds. BlackRock’s iShares has taken in more than $100 billion globally this year, the company said recently.

1181,BLK,BlackRock's Rieder not backing down from emerging market bet,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) bond investor Rick Rieder said on Monday he was not ready to completely back down from his bet on emerging markets despite a recent rout. “We think emerging markets is going to represent a great opportunity going into next year,” he said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York. Rieder, who is chief investment officer of global fixed income for the world’s largest asset manager, has been a big proponent of several emerging market bets that have paid off this year. But bonds have been under pressure as interest rates have risen and the dollar has strengthened, making repayment harder in other currencies. Moreover, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has promoted policies seen as potentially hurting U.S. trading partners, including Mexico and China. But Brazil and Argentina are opportunities, Rieder said, noting that emerging markets generally are not heavily indebted, have ample reserves and their central banks would cut rates if U.S. trade policies start to squeeze their economies. He said Trump’s proposed policies, including for $1 trillion worth of infrastructure spending, were likely better for stocks than bonds but unlikely to derail investors’ appetite for fixed income. Earlier this month, Rieder said that long-term government debt was particularly risky. That slice of the market has sold off massively in recent days. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note could rise to between 2.50 percent and 2.75 percent, Rieder said. He also said the odds of a U.S. recession are low as banks emboldened by looser regulations and higher long-term interest rates take more risks and lend to small businesses and consumers. The rally in bank stocks since the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election is likely to continue, he said. Low-cost shares of the $27.7 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX.O), which Rieder manages, are up 2.5 percent this year but rank only in the top 70 percent among peers grouped by Thomson Reuters Lipper.

1185,BLK,Canada unfazed by U.S. competition for infrastructure funds,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada is not worried about competing with the United States to draw private investment in infrastructure, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, adding that the country’s long-term stability is attractive to investors.  Canada’s government said this month it would set up an infrastructure bank and give it access to C$35 billion ($26 billion) to help fund major projects. It is also engaged in a charm offensive to attract private investors. However, it faces competition from the United States with President-elect Donald Trump planning $1 trillion of infrastructure spending, relying entirely on investment from the private sector. “I’m not worried about competing,” Trudeau said. “What I’m worried about is highlighting and putting forward the best possible understanding for people of the ease of doing business in Canada, the long-term growth potential here in Canada, the extraordinarily positive and educated workforce.” Trudeau said, in conversations with international investors, he had contrasted the mindset of Canadians with rising nationalism elsewhere. “People are curious to try and understand in a world where there’s a lot of anxiety and populism - whether it’s Brexit, the nationalists in Europe or even the election of the Republican candidate in the United States,” Trudeau said. “They are interested in knowing why Canada remains more open, remains more positive towards refugees and immigration. It’s our reasonableness, and thoughtfulness in our approach to politics that seems to them (international investors) a good predictor of long-term stability for this country,” he added. Canada’s government wants to attract $4 to $5 in private funding for every $1 coming from the public purse and is speaking to sovereign wealth funds and global private equity firms as well as domestic pension funds.

1186,BLK,UPDATE 2-Canada unfazed by U.S. competition for infrastructure funds,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada is not worried about competing with the United States to draw private investment in infrastructure, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, adding that the country’s long-term stability is attractive to investors.  Canada’s government said this month it would set up an infrastructure bank and give it access to C$35 billion ($26 billion) to help fund major projects. It is also engaged in a charm offensive to attract private investors. However, it faces competition from the United States with President-elect Donald Trump planning $1 trillion of infrastructure spending, relying entirely on investment from the private sector. “I’m not worried about competing,” Trudeau said. “What I’m worried about is highlighting and putting forward the best possible understanding for people of the ease of doing business in Canada, the long-term growth potential here in Canada, the extraordinarily positive and educated workforce.” Trudeau said, in conversations with international investors, he had contrasted the mindset of Canadians with rising nationalism elsewhere. “People are curious to try and understand in a world where there’s a lot of anxiety and populism - whether it’s Brexit, the nationalists in Europe or even the election of the Republican candidate in the United States,” Trudeau said. “They are interested in knowing why Canada remains more open, remains more positive towards refugees and immigration. It’s our reasonableness, and thoughtfulness in our approach to politics that seems to them (international investors) a good predictor of long-term stability for this country,” he added. Canada’s government wants to attract $4 to $5 in private funding for every $1 coming from the public purse and is speaking to sovereign wealth funds and global private equity firms as well as domestic pension funds.

1187,BLK,Famed Plaza District fades as Manhattan office landscape shifts,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lower leasing costs, more efficient office space and the hope of projecting an image more appealing to millennials are leading hedge funds and large corporations to leave Manhattan’s most-coveted business district for a rejuvenated Downtown and the trendy far West Side. The construction of gigantic new office buildings that allow tenants to use 20 percent less space is pressuring prices and driving firms like consultants BCG and law firm WilmerHale out of the tony Plaza District in Midtown Manhattan.  In the latest potential blow to the area surrounding the elegant Plaza Hotel - the city’s most coveted business address for decades - asset manager BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is poised to lease 850,000 square feet at a planned 58-story tower at the new Hudson Yards development on the far West Side. Also spurring the slow exodus is the notion that the area just southeast of Central Park, which includes the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, is showing its age and fails to satisfy the city’s burgeoning millennial workforce. Buildings along Park Avenue in the half-square-mile Plaza section of Midtown on average were built in 1960. The area roughly runs from 50th to 59th streets and is bounded by Lexington and Sixth Avenues. “For large, dynamic companies, these older buildings don’t work as well, they just don’t,” said Bill Montana, senior managing director at New York-based Savills Studley, a unit of global real estate firm Savills Plc (SVS.L). The new buildings are significantly more efficient and large companies use the space to compete for top talent, Montana said. Four towers with an average height of 69 stories that are under construction by Related Cos, Brookfield Properties and the Moinian Group at Hudson Yards already are pressuring prices. Five other behemoths have been proposed for the far West Side. Average leasing rates for 62 “trophy” buildings in Midtown have slid a touch more than 1 percent in October from a post-recession peak last year of $99.43 a square foot, which capped a 33 percent increase since 2009, real estate specialist Jones Lang LaSalle said. Asking rents for the Plaza District averaged $95.47 a square foot for Class A buildings in the third quarter, compared to $66.05 a square foot for space in the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, real estate firm Colliers International (CIGI.TO) said. BlackRock would like to add a cafeteria and auditorium, amenities that are missing at its two offices across the street from each other on 52nd Street, said a source with knowledge of the real estate search. The move, which would involve about 2,800 staff, but has not been finalized, is as good or better financially than to stay, the source said. Projected rents for anchor tenants in the Plaza District when BlackRock’s leases are up in 2023 are much higher. A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment. There is no new, large-scale construction underway in the Plaza District, though landlords have ordered major renovations such as a $325 million makeover at the old Time-Life Building on Sixth Avenue that has been rebranded 1271 Avenue of the Americas. To be sure, no one is writing the area off. The Plaza still has cachet for many. “Midtown will always prosper,” said Cynthia Wasserberger, a managing director at JLL in New York. “Those landlords have to react a little differently to how they’re going to fill the hole left behind.” Earlier this year JLL said almost half the world’s 428 hedge funds with at least $1 billion in assets had New York offices. Of those 208 sites, 94 percent were in Midtown Manhattan, with almost two-thirds located in the Plaza District, JLL said. One marquee hedge fund, Citadel LLC, in February agreed to pay a record $300 a square foot for part of the penthouse at 425 Park Avenue, according to media reports. Citadel’s average rent will be $175 a square foot on average after its other floors are included. Citadel declined to comment. Still, high-profile names have left or will soon, such as private equity firm KKR’s planned move from the Solow Building on West 57th Street, often called the city’s most prestigious building, to Hudson Yards. The move is seen as highly symbolic. The Plaza District has been losing ground for a while. It has been the third-lowest recipient of corporate cross-market relocations in Manhattan since 2011, when leases of more than 50,000 square feet are examined, according to Colliers. But the Plaza, the city’s biggest sub-market, has seen the largest departure of companies that have moved from Midtown, Midtown South or the downtown business centers in the almost six-year period up to mid-September, a Colliers report said. During that time Midtown lost 30 tenants, a dozen of those from the Plaza, including five that moved to new construction, Colliers said in its “Manhattan Without Borders” report. A drop-off in leasing demand is particularly apparent in the Plaza District, where the increase in available space surged by almost 4 percentage points in the third quarter to 12.9 percent from a year-ago, according to a recent Savills Studley report. “There is a very strong base of people who still want to be in the Plaza District, myself included,” Montana said. “For a lot of younger people, that’s not what they aspire to. So the demand is less for the Plaza District because of building stock and because of change in taste.” ",11222016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-property-plaza-exodus/famed-plaza-district-fades-as-manhattan-office-landscape-shifts-idUSL1N1DC0A6

1190,BLK,BlackRock's Rieder expects Fed to raise rates twice in 2017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates twice in 2017 following an expected rate hike at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting, a top bond manager at BlackRock (BLK.N), the world’s biggest asset manager, said on Friday. While the November U.S. jobs report, released earlier on Friday, was not as robust as some analysts had forecast, it “unquestionably sets the Fed up for a December policy rate hike,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a statement. After a rate increase later this month, the U.S. central bank “will then likely move twice more by the end of next year,” Rieder said.

1191,BLK,BlackRock adjusts leadership team for its largest mutual fund,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is making leadership changes to its biggest mutual fund. The world’s largest asset manager is replacing one of the top leaders on its $42 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund (MALOX.O) (MCLOX.O) and adding three new portfolio managers, a move that comes as the fund’s performance has lagged its rivals. Aldo Roldan, a managing director and portfolio manager, is stepping down as portfolio manager on the fund because he wanted to reduce his day-to-day responsibilities, a BlackRock spokeswoman said Wednesday. Roldan will continue to work on the Global Allocation team as a “senior investor,” focusing on research and analysis, she said. Three other investors will get top billing, including Russ Koesterich, the fund’s head of asset allocation, as well as David Clayton and Kent Hogshire, who already assist on the fund. The changes take effect Jan. 1. Koesterich is particularly well known outside the company as its former global chief investment strategist, a role in which he traveled widely and spoke to the press about the asset manager’s investment views. The company announced he was shifting to a new role supporting Global Allocation in March. The fund is a “multi-asset” portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments. New York-based BlackRock has been working to boost the investment performance of its stockpicking funds by introducing more data mining and rules-based investment techniques to its traditionalist teams, such as Global Allocation, which started in 1989. Much of the investment management industry has been wrestling with a move from active funds to passive ones that merely track an index because those funds often perform better and charge less. BlackRock is a major manager of index funds through its iShares exchange-traded funds business. Relatively low-cost institutional shares of Global Allocation are up 3.7 percent this year, trailing 72 percent of its peers, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. Over 10 years, the fund is in the top 20 percent. Investors pulled $8.1 billion from the fund this year, through November, according to the research service. Roldan joined the Global Allocation team in 2006. He has been one of three lead managers overseeing a sprawling collection of analysts, traders, marketing personnel and other staff who focus on the fund, alongside Dennis Stattman and Dan Chamby. A specialist in emerging markets who holds a doctorate in economics and econometrics from the University of Pennsylvania, Roldan joined BlackRock when it acquired the team’s former employer, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, in 2006.

1192,BLK,"BlackRock 'less committed' to specific targets, but forecasts growth","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top BlackRock Inc executive said the world’s largest asset manager could benefit from rising interest rates as its clients keep their stakes in bonds and as revenues from other businesses grow. BlackRock has previously said it targets 5 percent “organic” growth from new business overall, with low-single digit growth rates in its institutional business, high single-digit growth in retail and low double-digit growth in iShares, its booming ETF business. But BlackRock CFO Gary Shedlin, speaking on Wednesday at a Goldman Sachs event, said the company is “less committed to exactly where that growth is going to come from.” In the most recent quarter, reported in October, BlackRock’s retail and institutional organic asset growth was zero percent, while iShares was 15 percent. “While we still reaffirm that as an aspirational goal, I think we probably feel a little less committed to exactly where that growth is going to come from, primarily because we’re seeing massive adoption by both retail and institutional investors into ETFs.” BlackRock cut fees on a set of its ETFs in October, including lowering the annual fee on its stock-tracking iShares Core S&P; 500 ETF to 0.04 percent from 0.07 percent. Shedlin said the company had studied its peers and saw an opportunity “to get a 12- to 18-month head start” to win over new clients and cash by cutting fees. He said while slicing investor’s expenses cost money up front, the asset manager is well on its way to earning that revenue back due to the company gaining market share. The relatively low-cost iShares Core series that saw those price cuts has taken in about $15 billion since the announcement, Shedlin said, reflecting about 40 percent organic growth in two months. As rates rise, bond investors could face losses. But Shedlin said nearly two thirds of the company’s $1.6 trillion in fixed income assets are institutional, and those clients tend to stick around. He said the company’s money-market funds business also could earn more as the company drops fee waivers that it initiated as clients struggled with a low rates. BlackRock’s lucrative business of lending out the stocks and other securities it holds in its funds, often to speculating investors, also could throw off more revenue as the collateral it collects gets placed in higher-yielding investments. Shedlin said the company is also “under-penetrated” in relatively high-fee hedge funds, private equity and infrastructure businesses that can also expand.

1193,BLK,BlackRock to move to New York's trendy Hudson Yards district,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, plans to move its headquarters in 2022 from midtown Manhattan to a massive new office tower in the fast-growing Hudson Yards district on the city’s far West Side, the developers said on Thursday. BlackRock (BLK.N) entered into a letter of intent to lease 15 floors, or 850,000 square feet, of the 58-story tower, which developers Related Cos and Oxford Properties Group Inc said will be the city’s fourth-largest office tower. BlackRock received a $25 million tax credit from New York state as part of the move on the condition the company create 700 new jobs and retain its current staffing in the city of about 2,700 for a decade, the state’s development agency said. The column-free tower, which will be named 50 Hudson Yards, will be on the northwest corner of 10th Avenue and 33rd Street. It will have its own entrance to the subway and be able to accommodate more than 500 people on each floor. BlackRock currently has offices in two buildings on 52nd Street off Park Avenue, where its leases end in 2023. The new building is expected to be finished a year earlier and include a 400-seat auditorium. Hudson Yards, a mixed-use neighborhood rising over the rail yards and tracks serving nearby Penn Station, has attracted a number of marquee names, including Coach Inc, L’Oreal and the Boston Consulting Group. The National Hockey League on Tuesday announced plans to move to the district, where Wells Fargo Securities, Time Warner and Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts, among others, also have agreed to relocate. Blake Hutcheson, chief executive and president of Oxford Properties, called BlackRock’s move a ringing endorsement for the West Side, once a forlorn area of mostly parking lots.

1196,BLK,Tax cuts can offset damage from higher U.S. rates: BlackRock's Rieder,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top BlackRock Inc bond investor Rick Rieder on Wednesday said tax cuts would help the U.S. economy withstand even sharply higher interest rates. “Monetary policy has taken a backseat,” Reider, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, told Reuters after the Federal Reserve raised rates for the first time in a year. “The focus is completely different today.”  Rieder said he has sharply tapered his exposure to short-term government debt and is favoring U.S. corporate debt that pays much higher yields. Yields on shorter-dated Treasuries hit their highest in more than five years on Wednesday while the dollar rallied and stocks fell after the Fed raised rates, as expected, and signaled a faster pace of hikes in 2017. [MKTS/GLOB] “It was clearly more hawkish than markets would have anticipated,” Rieder said. Ten-year Treasury yields could move from 2.58 percent to the low 3 percent range in 2017, Rieder said, and he has already trimmed exposure to longer-term government debt. A further move up in rates of 0.50 percentage points could start to create a drag on the economy, but that economic hit could be offset easily by tax cuts. He said if rates moved up by 100 basis points but U.S. personal income taxes were cut by 5 percent, the tax cut would have a bigger impact on the economy, citing BlackRock research. “That certainly would soften any blow,” he said, as would solid economic growth. That means central banks have receded in importance, compared with government spending policies. “Risk assets and commodities are focused on the forward growth trajectory,” he said. Rieder laid out a more positive post-hike outlook than what happened after the last rate increase in December 2015. After that move, S&P; 500 stocks sold off by nearly 12 percent. Bonds and commodities also fell until the market bottomed this February. Rieder is looking for buying opportunities in lower-grade U.S. corporate debt, which he sees as a safer bet than other high-yielding assets, such as emerging market fixed income. The markets are offering an opportunity to make those purchases. The iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the lower-grade corporate market, fell nearly 0.8 percent on Wednesday. Other investors are veering away from that market. Junk bonds will drop into a “black hole of illiquidity” if the 10-year Treasury yield exceeds 3 percent next year, DoubleLine Capital Chief Executive Jeffrey Gundlach said on Tuesday.

1197,BLK,BlackRock to lead funding round for fintech startup,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc plans to lead the next funding round for the startup iCapital Network, which gives individual investors access to private equity funds, hedge funds, and other alternative investments, the two companies said on Thursday. BlackRock has been eager to expand its footprint in financial technology and in alternative investments, which are used by wealthy individual investors but remain the domain largely of institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance firms. Last year BlackRock bought FutureAdvisor, a robo-adviser that manages savings for individual investors. It also has been bulking up its own staff of developers, who work on Aladdin, the company’s operating system for investment management. Previous investors in iCapital have included Credit Suisse Group AG. Competitors include Artivest, with backers such as private equity firm KKR & Co and billionaire investor Peter Thiel. BlackRock uses Artivest to sell a private infrastructure fund through financial advisers. Frank Porcelli, chairman of BlackRock’s Wealth Advisory unit that sells to financial advisory firms, is also joining the iCapital board. The company said it has about 3,000 investors who use its platform to access private investments. Terms of the deal, the size of the investment round and the startup’s valuation were not disclosed.

1198,BLK,ETFs globally gather record cash in 2016 -BlackRock,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors funneled $375 billion into exchange-traded funds in  2016, investment manager BlackRock Inc said on Tuesday, a global record that came as investors looked to cut costs. The total, which is preliminary, compares with $348 billion in 2015 and includes a record $286 billion haul in the United States, home to the funds’ biggest market. ETFs are a basket of stocks or other assets traded by individual investors and institutions. Fund managers from BlackRock to Vanguard and Schwab offer index ETFs that try to track, not beat, the market. They have sliced management fees on some funds to as little as $3 annually for every $10,000 managed. All three companies announced price cuts last year. Those low fees along with other cost savings and conveniences have helped the more than $3 trillion ETF business take assets from rival financial products, including actively managed funds that attempt to beat the market but may fall short of that goal. U.S.-based active stock funds recorded $288 billion in withdrawals in 2016, the largest on record, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters Lipper data through November. ETF issuers were also able to draw investors into “smart beta” products that often attempt to beat the markets but do so based on a set of rules governing how they invest, rather than a portfolio manager making those calls. The products can be pricier for investors than traditional index funds while still undercutting active managers. “The fact that we’re at new-record inflows with such a slow start is a pretty strong reversal,” said David Perlman, an ETF researcher at UBS. Markets started 2016 in bad shape, after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates and as oil prices cratered. Stocks managed to rebound from a February low, but events including the U.S. presidential race and the British vote to exit the European Union kept investors skittish. Money moved to the perceived safety of the fixed-income market, and BlackRock’s early data showed bond ETFs taking in a record $115 billion in 2016.  BlackRock, with $1.3 trillion in global ETF assets, is the largest provider of such funds. Its iShares ETF brand attracted $140 billion globally during the year, BlackRock said, describing that figure as a record. In the U.S., BlackRock attracted $105 billion into ETFs during the year, followed by Vanguard’s $94 billion, State Street’s $52 billion and Schwab’s $16 billion, according to separate estimates by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

1199,BLK,BlackRock's U.S.-based active funds post record 2016 withdrawals: Morningstar,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled $19.3 billion from BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) U.S.-based actively managed mutual funds in 2016, Morningstar Inc estimates showed on Tuesday, a record high as the investment industry struggles to restrain an exodus to lower-cost investments. The funds posted nearly $8.5 billion in outflows during the fourth quarter, the research service said. An industry bellwether, New York-based BlackRock also owns one of the most prized businesses in asset management, its iShares exchange-traded funds franchise. That business has profited from investor’s shift from active to passive funds. Many ETFs are relatively low cost and aim merely to track the market, not to beat it. U.S.-based actively managed stock funds suffered $288 billion in withdrawals in 2016 through November, the largest on record, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper service. The figure tops outflows of $139 billion in 2015 and $218 billion in 2008. On the passive side, stock index mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds each attracted about the same amount of new cash, more than $112 billion apiece in 2016, Lipper said. Earlier Tuesday, the world’s largest asset manager said it took in $140 billion into its ETF business overall during 2016, a new global record and larger than its rivals. Some index-tracking ETFs charge as little as $3 annually for every $10,000 they manage, while the average charged by U.S. stock mutual fund managers is $131, according to data for 2015 from the Investment Company Institute trade group. The active fund withdrawals come as BlackRock has been working to boost the investment performance of its stockpicking managers by introducing more data mining and rules-based investment techniques to its traditionalist teams, which it calls “Fundamental Active Equity.” Performance showed signs of improvement in November, with the percentage of BlackRock funds holding the top Morningstar star ratings over three years increasing to 64 percent, up from 51 percent in October and compared to a 33 percent industry average, according to Credit Suisse AG. BlackRock is slated to report its fourth quarter and full-year results on Jan. 13. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

By doing so, they avoid a 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate. “I don’t believe the concept that repatriation is going to stimulate our economy - I’ve never believed in that,” Fink told CNBC in an interview tied to his company’s 2016 earnings release. Fink said it is not likely that the money companies bring back would go to “building factories” and growing the economy.

1202,BLK,BlackRock CEO sees upside in Trump's U.S. infrastructure plans,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) CEO Larry Fink seems optimistic about the potential for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan under the new administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. “Within the U.S. alone, markets are anticipating up to $1 trillion of domestic infrastructure investments over the next few years,” he said on a call discussing the company’s 2016 earnings with analysts on Friday. “We all know we desperately need those investments.” The benefits might also trickle down to his company’s own bottom line. BlackRock has been building up its own infrastructure unit, started in 2011. It works on public-private partnerships globally, and on complex endeavors that can range from wind farms to transportation projects, financed by equity or debt. If the U.S. supports subsidized bonds like Build America Bonds, BlackRock municipal bond funds could snap them up, Fink told Reuters. Those bonds, which were offered under the economic stimulus advanced during the Obama administration, gave issuers a subsidy of some of their interest costs. BlackRock’s private infrastructure funds also could support public-private partnerships, he said. “Not just in the U.S. but globally we’ve built a large presence in infrastructure,” Fink said in the phone interview. “We’re very excited about our team.” BlackRock actively managed $750 billion in bond assets at year’s end. Its infrastructure assets under management were $9 billion as of last year.      Such funds typically target institutions who can lock up large initial investments for a decade or more, but BlackRock has increasingly been targeting individual investors for such “alternative” investments, meaning those unlike traditional stock or bond holdings. Last month BlackRock said it would lead a funding round for a startup called iCapital Network, which eases the path for individual investors to access private equity funds and other alternatives. Overall, BlackRock manages $5.1 trillion in assets. While the details of Washington’s plan for U.S. infrastructure are not yet clear, people on Trump’s team have touted public-private partnerships, including the president-elect’s choice to run the U.S. Transportation Department, Elaine Chao, speaking Wednesday at her Senate confirmation hearing. “If there are more of these assets created with the administration, you’d look to BlackRock to tap into that and invest,” said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders.

1204,BLK,BlackRock profit beats as investors race to low-cost funds,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager, reported better-than-expected quarterly profits on Friday as it clamped down on expenses and investors stormed into lower-cost funds to take advantage of a year-end rally. Investors poured $88 billion into the company’s market-tracking index investments and its iShares exchange-traded funds during the quarter, while pulling $546 million from funds managed actively by portfolio managers, underscoring a stark dichotomy of investors favoring lower-cost, passive investments. “We’re the big beneficiary of that change, but we’ll be a beneficiary if there’s a rebound into active,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told Reuters.  “We have the footprint, we have the breadth of product that clients are looking for.” That preference for low-fee funds has come with costs for the asset management industry, while BlackRock’s large iShares franchise has helped because of the low cost of accessing the market through many index funds. Investors poured a record $202 billion into its funds last year. But BlackRock, which manages $5.1 trillion, still paid a price for many of its most popular offerings being its lowest cost. Index funds, excluding iShares, account for 38 percent of the firm’s assets but only 10 percent of the fees it collects to manage the funds and lend out the shares they hold. While its assets grew 10.8 percent this year, those fees grew just 0.4 percent. Costs aside, the company continued to grow, unlike many rivals. Fund managers who actively pick stocks experienced record withdrawals despite a rally in U.S. stocks sparked by the surprise November presidential election of Donald Trump due to his campaign promises to cut taxes and regulations. Some index-tracking ETFs charge as little as $3 annually for every $10,000 they manage, while the average charged by U.S. stock mutual fund managers is $131, according to data for 2015 from the Investment Company Institute trade group. BlackRock and several of its rivals, including Vanguard Group, cut fees on top products last year. “The fees are also coming into focus as you have this bull market to your back and investors look to pay much lower fees,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Cyprys. “The value for money is increasingly coming into focus.” Cyprys said BlackRock’s growth rate is “among the best within the industry.” BlackRock’s stock rose 0.8 percent in afternoon trading. They gained nearly 12 percent last year, while its peers in the Dow Jones U.S. Asset Managers Index gained 8.6 percent. The company also said it is hiking its dividend by 9 percent and ramping up its share buyback program. It also kept a tight lid on expenses, for instance, reducing headcount early in 2016. Total expenses in the quarter fell 3.5 percent. Overall, the New York-based company’s net income fell to $851 million in the fourth quarter from $861 million a year earlier. Earnings per share, however, rose to $5.13, from $5.11, as the number of shares outstanding decreased.

Deutsche Boerse and LSEG have been working to overcome regulatory hurdles holding up the merger and looking to appease antitrust regulators. LSEG agreed this month to sell its French clearing business to Euronext (ENX.PA). “Sceptics of this merger must consider the need for stronger capital markets in Europe - as well as the ways the alliance could in fact benefit competition by deepening access to capital on the continent,” Blackrock Chairman Laurence Fink said in a speech at a Deutsche Boerse reception on Monday. “Deutsche Boerse itself has taken an important step towards healthier markets through the proposed merger with LSE.” The German state of Hesse, which has the authority to veto a merger of the two exchange operators, will host a summit on Tuesday to review the tie-up. Britain’s preparations to trigger divorce talks with the European Union have put a question mark over the deal because a Brexit would place London, Europe’s financial capital and planned headquarters of the new group, outside the bloc. British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to use a speech on Tuesday to signal a so-called “hard Brexit”, meaning Britain would pull out of the single market and customs union. German regulators, fearing a loss of control, want Frankfurt to play the leading role, or, at the very least, be one of two headquarters with London. Blackrock’s Fink also said that Germany needed to keep a close relationship with Britain. “Brexit means that maintaining ties with London is even more important today, given its more developed capital markets,” he said in a prepared speech.  Fink, who is part of President-elect Donald Trump’s business advisory council, also hailed the moral leadership of Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel. “Despite the terrible events in Berlin only a couple of weeks ago, Germany has demonstrated its ability to balance acts of humanity and economic and political challenges that come along with it,” Fink said, referring to the attack in which a truck ploughed into a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12.   Trump’s stance on immigration contrasts sharply with that of Merkel, whose policy has allowed for an influx of more than a million migrants into Germany in 2015 and 2016, mainly Muslims fleeing war-torn countries including Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

1226,BLK,BlackRock to ask if companies spend cash from tax holiday on growth,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc will scrutinize how companies plan to use the cash they bring back to the United States as part of a tax holiday backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, CEO Larry Fink said in a letter distributed on Tuesday. During his election campaign, Trump backed a policy of cutting taxes on cash that countries repatriate as a way to entice them to invest their overseas money in the United States. Companies such as Apple Inc, Pfizer Inc, Microsoft Corp hold nearly $1.8 trillion overseas, Moody’s Investors Service Inc estimated last month. By doing so, they avoid a 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate. But Fink said the tax cuts may do little to boost economic growth as investors pile the cash into buying their shares back or paying a dividend, boosting their stock prices, but not hiring new employees or growing their businesses. BlackRock oversees $5.1 trillion in assets, ranking as a top shareholder of many of the world’s largest companies. It votes on the composition of those companies’ boards as well as on governance proposals from management and shareholders. “If tax reform also includes some form of reduced taxation for repatriation of cash trapped overseas, BlackRock will be looking to companies’ strategic frameworks for an explanation of whether they will bring cash back to the U.S. and if so, how they plan to use it,” Fink wrote in an annual letter to the CEOs of the S&P; 500.  Fink also said U.S. lawmakers should raise the threshold at which capital gains on investments are taxed at a reduced rate, from one year to three years, to reward long-term investment. Fink, who had donated to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, recently joined an advisory council to Trump that includes several other CEOs. In his letter Fink wrote how developments such as Brexit and new policies of U.S. President Donald Trump reflect “a growing backlash against the impact globalization and technological change are having on many workers and communities.” He also called on companies to do more to train employees. Charles Elson, a University of Delaware finance professor who follows corporate governance issues, said the language shows how Trump’s rise has caused business leaders like Fink to pay attention to matters such as inequality. “CEOs are responsive to the public,” Elson said. “His customers are the public and a healthy portion of the public has concerns about globalization.” ",1242017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-ceo/blackrock-to-ask-if-companies-spend-cash-from-tax-holiday-on-growth-idUSKBN1581WX

Britain is the main centre for the multi-billion-euro clearing business - mainly via the London Stock Exchange’s LCH.Clearnet business - but its dominance has been called into question by Brexit. “One thing is very clear to me that if you are really outside, I don’t see how clearing can be outside the European Union,” said Hildebrand, vice chairman of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, and a former governor of non-EU Switzerland’s central bank. “It seems fairly obvious to me that if the end result is indeed a hard Brexit, i.e completely out of the European Union, the single market, I don’t really see how the core financial functions, clearing being one of them, could be anywhere but inside the European Union,” Hildebrand told a banking conference in Dublin. Prime Minister Theresa May made it clear last week that Britain would leave the EU’s single market of 500 million people.  An EU official told Reuters last month that the bloc is considering legislative measures to take clearing of euro-denominated derivatives and other financial contracts into the euro zone, a change of location which Hildebrand said appears “fairly self evident”. Frankfurt or Paris are seen as the most likely centres to take euro clearing business if it moves from London.

1232,BLK,"UPDATE 2-BlackRock jilts State St, moves $1 trillion in custody assets to JPMorgan","BOSTON (Reuters) - State Street Corp (STT.N) on Wednesday reported a 3.4 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue and said it lost more than $1 trillion in custody assets to JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc (JPM.N), sending State Street stock tumbling as much as 7.5 percent. State Street is the world’s No. 2 custody bank with $28.8 trillion in assets under custody and administration. But the figure could shrink by more than 3 percent after JPMorgan said on Wednesday that it was chosen by BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) to be custodian for more than $1 trillion in assets.  Boston-based State Street, BlackRock’s custodian since 1988, will continue to service the asset manager’s fast-growing iShares ETF assets. Over the years, the two companies have been “joined at the hip,” as one State Street executive put it during a conference call with analysts and investors.  The announcement came as State Street reported total revenue of $2.53 billion in the fourth quarter, a 3.4 percent decline from the year-earlier period.  For JPMorgan, the deal is more of a feather in its cap than a windfall to its bottom line. The deal boosts JPMorgan’s assets under custody, which it pegged at $20.5 trillion at the end of December, by about 5 percent. The new business is expected to add annual revenue on the order of tens of millions of dollars and be included in the company’s securities services revenue, which last year amounted to $3.6 billion. JPMorgan’s total reported revenue for the entire company was $95.7 billion in 2016 and its net income was $24.7 billion. Still, the deal is the kind of prize sought by Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan’s chief executive officer for corporate and investment banking. Pinto, speaking to investors in February, named custody and fund services as one of his most important business lines and a focus of management attention “with technology being at the core of it.” Executives at State Street, meanwhile, said on a conference call that the loss of BlackRock assets is not part of a broader trend. The bank said it won $1.4 trillion in new asset servicing commitments in 2016. Still, the developments unsettled investors.

1237,BLK,Fund firms plan to get tough on excessive pay at Britain's top firms,"* BlackRock, Legal & General among firms to speak out * Norway oil fund to update global guidance to companies * Pension trade body calls for more action from investors By Simon Jessop LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Some of the biggest holders of UK stocks plan to get tougher on executive pay, as the government turns up the heat over the yawning income gap between bosses and employees following Britons’ vote to leave the European Union. Doubts remain over whether shareholders will force through many major changes. Nevertheless, three of the five biggest investors in companies on the FTSE 350 index have set out fresh guidance on setting top pay, or say they plan to do so before votes at annual general meetings (AGMs) this spring. Fund managers typically worry about how incentive schemes will encourage executives to achieve better returns for shareholders, and not necessarily about the amount the bosses take home - the often startling sums which grab media headlines. So far, investors have had little public success in forcing company boards to change executive pay arrangements by accepting their guidance, and often their complaints about excessive handouts have fallen on deaf ears. But now, with Prime Minister Theresa May championing those Britons who are struggling to get by, more is at stake. The fund arm of insurer Legal & General, the number two investor in FTSE 350 stocks, issued new guidance last autumn and says it won’t be alone in holding firms to greater account. “We believe more scrutiny will arise both for companies and investors in the 2017 AGM season,” Sacha Sadan, Legal and General Investment Management’s director of Corporate Governance, told Reuters. “This is due to a combination of social, political and financial pressure on companies to address the widening differential between executive teams and employees,” he said. According to the High Pay Centre, a campaign group, the median annual pay of bosses at the 100 biggest London-listed companies stands at just under 4 million pounds ($5 million). It declared Jan. 4 as “Fat Cat Wednesday 2017”, estimating that by midday, chief executives had already earned more than the average British worker will make all year: 28,200 pounds. Criticism of “Fat Cats” goes back decades but last June’s EU referendum exposed a deep divide between those at the top of corporate and political life, and the wider public. Highlighting this resentment, May has proposed reforms to curb excessive pay and improve accountability to shareholders.  “It is essential for business to demonstrate leadership - to show that, in this globalised world, everyone is playing by the same rules, and that the benefits of economic success are there for all our citizens,” she told the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. U.S. fund manager Blackrock - which holds around $1.6 trillion of UK stocks and is the biggest investor in the FTSE 350 - warned last week it would vote against boards which failed to meet its new guidelines on pay policy. These include ensuring that executives’ pay rises no more than salaries of the workers they employ, and that it is linked to long-term performance. The High Pay Centre reported a 10 percent increase in chief executives’ pay in 2015, far outstripping the 2.4 percent growth of British average earnings. Norges Bank Investment Management - the investment arm of Norway’s sovereign wealth fund and the fourth-biggest FTSE 350 investor, told Reuters it also expects to issue fresh guidelines in the coming weeks. Vanguard Group, the third-biggest investor, and Capital Group, the fifth-biggest, said they were both reviewing their plans. The smaller M&G; Investments published pay guidelines for the for the first time in November. The two main types of pay votes at AGMs are on executive remuneration for the previous year, held annually and which are  non-binding, and on the policy framework to be used in setting future pay. These policy votes must be held at least every three years, and have been binding since 2014. While some companies have updated their policies since 2014, most have waited for the triennial vote to come round again and are therefore planning to do so this year. Investors have scored some symbolic victories. For example, they rejected a $20 million pay deal for BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley, but the vote was non-binding. Last year 42 companies in the FTSE 350 had more than 20 percent of their shareholders vote against either executive pay or the policy for setting it. However, few changes have since been announced to their managements’ pay arrangements. Weir Group did lose a binding vote on its pay policy and was forced to abandon a change that would have lowered the maximum payout to senior management but removed performance criteria. Along with BP, Smith & Nephew and Paysafe Group  also lost non-binding votes on 2015 pay and said they would consult shareholders on the matter. Anglo American, Babcock International and others flagged their intention to set out new plans at AGMs this year to be put to shareholders. Bosses’ total pay dipped slightly in 2015 but company earnings fell more, meaning they took home a bigger slice of profits, continuing a decade-long trend. Investors complain it’s often hard to see how incentive packages are supposed to work. “It’s first and foremost the complexity: is there a clear link between results and payment?” said Egril Matsen, who is in charge of supervising Norway’s $885 billion wealth fund. “The transparency of these packages seems to have worsened over time.” Change will be difficult to achieve. Many fund managers own only a small part of a company, with some afraid to challenge too much for fear that their access to managements will be reduced. Others, in some cases, find it hard to argue for pay restraint given their own often large salaries. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) says few investors ever vote against keeping the board members in charge of setting the pay structure - the Remuneration Committee (RemCo) chair - in position for another year. “There’s not been enough individual accountability in the past,” said Luke Hildyard, who helps set guidance for PLSA  members. “We feel it’s time to escalate our approach to holding companies to account over this, and to start voting against the RemCo chair when voting against the remuneration policy.” Support for a wholesale change of tack isn’t universal. Schroders, Aberdeen Asset Management and Columbia Threadneedle all said they had no plans to change their approach to pay across the board this year; the remaining top-15 investors in the FTSE 350 all declined to comment or did not respond when contacted by Reuters. “This year is an important year because of the triennial vote,” said Sarah Wilson CEO of proxy voting adviser Manifest. “But is it going to be the case where companies don’t take it seriously until a Remuneration Committee chairman loses their job?”  ($1 = 0.8012 pounds)   (Additional reporting by Rob Bousso and Barbara Lewis; editing by David Stamp)",1252017,http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-funds-agms/fund-firms-plan-to-get-tough-on-excessive-pay-at-britains-top-firms-idUSL5N1F72J1

1239,BLK,Fed may hike rates four times this year: BlackRock's Rieder,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve could hike interest rates as many as four times this year, a move that markets are not sufficiently anticipating, BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) chief investment officer of global fixed income said on Wednesday. “If the Fed does move in March, we could see as many as four hikes in 2017, and as long as data remains supportive, very likely three hikes,” Rick Rieder said in a note.     The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady earlier on Wednesday in its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office, while painting an upbeat picture of the U.S. economy. But Rieder, whose New York-based employer is the world’s largest asset manager and a major bond investor, said markets have been slow to appreciate the tighter monetary policy that could come with a potential economic stimulus and faster economic growth under the new administration. There are seven more Fed policy meetings in 2017, with the next one scheduled for March 14-15. Fed fund futures suggest there is a less-than-20 percent likelihood of a rate hike in March, but the odds are closer to 50 percent unless there is a major shock to the economy or economic data deteriorates, Rieder said. Wages and economic optimism are on the rise, he said. That could lead to four rate hikes and further discussions about whether, when and how to decrease the amount of assets held on the Fed’s balance sheet, according to Rieder. “This does present the possibility of policy risk, if interest rates were to increase too rapidly, or too much, and cut off the recovery in an abrupt manner,” he said.      “Still, we think the U.S. economy can withstand somewhat higher rates, and in fact we do expect rates to edge up further this year, but there are limits. The need to maintain the strength of the housing market, and the increased levels of both government and corporate sector leverage, would make any meaningful, or abrupt, move higher in rates from current levels somewhat concerning.” ",2012017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-fed-outlook/fed-may-hike-rates-four-times-this-year-blackrocks-rieder-idUSKBN15G5U0

1242,BLK,BlackRock makes energy acquisition as U.S. infrastructure policy looms,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc is pushing further into the private infrastructure market with an agreement to buy First Reserve Corp’s Energy Infrastructure Funds unit. The 37-member energy infrastructure team at First Reserve, which manages $3.7 billion in two funds, will join BlackRock, the New York-based asset manager said in a statement on Wednesday. The team has investments in North America, Latin America, Europe and Southeast Asia. The deal by the world’s largest asset manager comes as BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink has pushed for more public-private partnerships to rebuild key infrastructure and as the young administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has touted a possible $1 trillion plan. Fink recently joined an advisory council to Trump that includes several other CEOs.  “This transaction enables BlackRock to better connect its clients with energy infrastructure projects that can provide income generation, diversification and inflation protection,” BlackRock said in a statement. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. It is expected to close by the end of the second quarter. BlackRock, known more for stock and bond funds, has been building up its infrastructure unit, which it started in 2011. The group works on public-private partnerships globally and on complex endeavors that can range from wind farms to transportation projects, financed by equity or debt.

1245,BLK,"Lacking voting rights, Snap IPO to test fund governance talk","BOSTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares sold in a $3 billion initial public offering by the parent of Snapchat will lack voting power, testing the commitment of big asset managers in their recent fight for investor rights. In a registration document on Thursday that it will use to pitch shares to investors, Snap Inc outlined an aggressive expansion plan for its social media network in what would be the biggest U.S. tech IPO since Facebook. But the document shows the shares will not have voting rights - an unprecedented feature for an IPO despite years of rising concerns about corporate governance from fund managers looking to gain influence over executives. Indeed, just earlier this week top fund managers including BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group Inc and T Rowe Price launched an initiative to improve governance, among other things, calling for companies to give shareholders voting rights “in proportion to their economic interest.” Technically, the framework outlined by the group does not go into effect until the start of 2018, to give companies time to adjust. But Charles Elson, a professor at the University of Delaware who follows corporate governance, said that to reinforce their message, the big fund managers should not buy into the IPO of Snap or others that might follow. “They should not buy common stock without a vote,” Elson  said. That should even include index funds, which ordinarily buy shares to reflect the sector or group of stocks they track, he said.     For investors who do buy Snap shares without voting rights, Elson said, “You’re completely hostage to the actions of management.” A Snap representative declined to comment. Snap’s filing states it will have a unique stock structure with three share classes, which will concentrate voting power with its co-founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy. Each of their shares is entitled to 10 votes on governance matters. Current investors such as venture capital firms will have shares entitled to one vote, and shares being sold to the public will have no voting rights. The filing acknowledges the concentrated control could impact Snap’s share price. Other technology giants have also been adding to founders’ voting power including Facebook and Google. To be sure, Snap’s filing contains a provision to eventually grant all shares an equal vote, but only if both founders die or their ownership falls below a threshold. In a note on Friday, Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor wrote that while tight control may be justified in a company’s private early stages, it is not in large, public companies whose problems can be worsened because founders “tend to be emotionally attached to their companies.” Ordinarily his firm would discount its valuation of a company by 30 percent, when founders keep control to offset the extra risk to investors, Windsor wrote. A spokesman for T. Rowe Price Group said the company would not comment. Representatives of BlackRock and Vanguard did not comment. Another backer of the new governance principles is the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, with roughly $200 billion under management. Aeisha Mastagni, a portfolio manager for the system, said while it does not normally buy shares during IPOs, it usually buys companies like Snap once their stocks wind up in stock indexes like the Russell 3000. Avoiding Snap would only shift the risk to other parts of the portfolio, she said. The thinking could be different for actively-managed   funds, she said, especially in a case like Snap where investors would lack votes needed to change management in a crisis. “With companies like this, you think they’re always fine, until they’re not,” Mastagni said. CalSTRS was among a group of 18 co-signers of a letter the Council of Institutional Investors sent to Snap on Friday, urging it to adopt a single-class structure. Other signatories came from representatives of public pension managers like the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the Florida State Board of Administration.

Shearer is a managing director and lead portfolio manager for the nearly $22 billion BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund, BlackRock’s third-largest mutual fund and its biggest concentrated primarily on picking stocks, aiming to buy stakes in companies that can boost their dividends. Responsibility for the group that oversees the fund and related accounts will be handed over to Tony DeSpirito, currently a co-head and co-portfolio manager on the team, the memo said. Institutional shares of the fund gained 7.2 percent a year for the past 10 years, according to Lipper, beating most of its rivals. Shearer has been portfolio manager on the fund since 2001, while DeSpirito stepped into a leading role in 2014. “Ever the professional, Bob told us he arrived at this decision in part because of the strength of the team and prospects for the business,” according to the memo provided to Reuters by the company.

The fund has held the stock since October 2015, according to Morningstar Inc. The latest disclosures do not make clear how much of the Alphabet stake has been sold. The 10th-largest Global Allocation holding, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), accounted for about 0.58 percent of the fund, which would work out to $237 million, suggesting the Google stake had fallen at least to that level. Alphabet did not respond to requests for comment.

1256,BLK,U.S. regulators push new ETF rules despite industry's howl,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are advancing rules this week to tighten standards on the ballooning exchange-traded fund industry over the objections of asset managers including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Invesco Ltd (IVZ.N). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year pushed the three main ETF trading venues to draft rules that explicitly require the funds to continually pass a number of tests or face the possibility of being shut down, according to three people with knowledge of the matter and the regulator’s filings. The regulator approved the second of the three proposals in a notice posted on Wednesday and could rule on the third in coming days. The latest regulatory actions highlight concerns over the potential for trading abuses affecting ETFs, especially those tracking indexes that include assets that are not traded often. ETF managers including BlackRock and Invesco have sent letters to the SEC arguing that the rules are unnecessary and could force some ETFs to be declared out of compliance or shut down even if the fund itself is not at risk. The funds have remained one of the fastest growing parts of the market despite concerns over their durability during periods of market stress, for instance after a “flash crash” that pummeled some ETFs on Aug. 24, 2015. ETFs will be required to meet requirements detailed in 314 pages of exchange filings unless they are granted an exception. For instance, a stock index fund needs to track a benchmark with a minimum number of equities that meet a target market value and trading volume. “There is a lot of concern about manipulation,” said James Simpson, president of ETP Resources LLC, a consulting and data company, and a former American Stock Exchange official, who said the listing standards for ETFs are “problematic” and “outdated.” The SEC backs the rules on the belief they could prevent market rigging, for instance, if an ETF tracks a group of rarely traded stocks whose prices could easily be manipulated, according to a person familiar with the SEC’s reasoning and the agency’s disclosures on the topic. A SEC spokeswoman declined to comment. ETFs have grown at double-digit percentages every year this century, allowing investors to buy commodities such as gold, companies in an entire industry sector or vast swaths of the bond market as easily as trading single stock. Assets in the funds reached a record near-$3.7 trillion in January, according to industry researcher ETFGI. Rules answering the SEC’s concerns drafted by CBOE Holdings Inc’s (CBOE.O) Bats exchange were approved in the notice posted on Wednesday, and a verdict could come soon on a proposal by the Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s (ICE.N) NYSE Arca exchange, the largest listing venue for ETFs. Nasdaq Inc’s (NDAQ.O) revised listing standards have already been approved. ETFs already have to meet requirements to be listed. But the latest changes specify the funds must meet those standards not just when they launch but as long as they are trading. The rules also bolster restrictions on trading firms or fund managers for setting the rules determining what stocks are in an index and calculating what the index is worth.  But even one of the exchanges has reservations about the new standards. “The continuing listing standards in their current proposed form may cause undue costs for fund managers as well as a negative impact for investors, without offering additional protections for the shareholders of the ETF,” said Doug Yones, NYSE’s head of exchange-traded products, in a statement to Reuters. Nasdaq and Bats declined to comment. In its notice, the SEC dismissed industry concerns, writing that the absence of ongoing standards is a “gap” in regulation. The agency, which in 1992 first approved exceptions to U.S. law that allowed ETFs to trade, has been conducting a broad review of the industry. The rules are aimed at achieving the same goals as the requirements applied before funds start trading, including ensuring the products “are not susceptible to manipulation and maintaining fair and orderly markets,” the SEC wrote. An ETF could violate the rules if it tracks an index holding stocks falling below a certain trading volume, even if the ETF does not hold that stock, ETF managers and an industry group argued. They said it is not clear how the proposals address concerns about market manipulation. “This would introduce monitoring and oversight for something that we don’t control,” the funds’ indexes, said Chuck Thomas, head of U.S. ETF capital markets at Vanguard Group. He said the impact on Vanguard funds would be minimal. BlackRock and Invesco declined interview requests.

1257,BLK,"BlackRock vows new pressure on climate, board diversity","BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, which wields outsized clout as the world’s largest asset manager, planned on Monday to put new pressure on companies to explain themselves on issues including how climate change could affect their business as well as boardroom diversity. The move by BlackRock, a powerful force in Corporate America with $5.1 trillion under management, could bolster efforts like climate-risk disclosure practices developed by the Financial Stability Board, the international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. BlackRock, which holds stakes in most major U.S. corporations, identified its top “engagement priorities” for meetings this year with corporate leaders in documents to be posted on its website on Monday, with climate risk and boardroom diversity on the list. Reuters received advance copies of the materials. Michelle Edkins, set to oversee the outreach effort as head of a 30-person team, said BlackRock might want to hear from companies about how they are assessing the risk that climate change may pose to their operations. Edkins cited the example of how rising ocean levels could swamp a real estate company’s valuable beachfront property. Some companies have shown leadership on the areas BlackRock considers priorities, Edkins said, while others need improvement. “There are firms where we think they’re probably not moving fast enough given the risks to the business,” Edkins said in a telephone interview on Sunday. The action marked a step-up in BlackRock’s advocacy with boards and executives, and comes after the fund giant was criticized by environmental and labor activists for not backing proxy resolutions dealing with climate change and other topics more often at shareholder meetings. BlackRock stopped short of pledging to vote more often against companies’ management. It said it still prefers private meetings with executives and casts critical proxy votes only as a last straw. “We can’t micromanage,” Edkins said. Activists said BlackRock deserves credit for making climate change a central focus. “They have made a turn in the road. They are looking at their proxies differently,” said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management in Boston. Outlining its priorities, BlackRock urged some companies to be ready to discuss concerns such as how they could use climate-risk disclosure practices developed by a Financial Stability Board task force. BlackRock also said it will expect that at companies in sectors associated with climate risk such as oil producers,   miners or real estate companies, all directors should “have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business” and how a given company will address it. As a result of BlackRock’s new initiative, Smith said Walden and others including a Seattle city employees’ retirement system have withdrawn a proposal calling for the fund giant to review its proxy-voting process and record on climate change. Smith said BlackRock’s new approach could make a difference such as on resolutions urging energy giants to report on the impact that public policies aimed at curbing climate change could have on their business. One such resolution at Exxon Mobil  last year received support from around 38 percent of votes cast. BlackRock opposed the resolution and owned about 6 percent of the company at the time, securities filings show. Edkins said BlackRock’s votes on such measures in the future would depend on circumstances like how they are worded. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment ahead of the company’s proxy statement due next month. BlackRock also said it will look to understand how companies are working to increase boardroom diversity, such as adding more women. “Diverse boards, including but not limited to diversity of expertise, experience, age, race and gender, make better decisions,” BlackRock said in the documents. Some companies wrongly believe they already possess a diverse board of directors, Edkins said. “A guy from Yale and a guy from Harvard does not count as diversity,” Edkins said. BlackRock’s guidance marks the latest investor call for corporate executives to pay more attention to matters to which they might have given little thought in the past. New deposits into funds that invest according to environmental, social or responsible governance criteria have been a rare bright spot for active fund managers lately. Big fund firms have taken notice. State Street Corp, a BlackRock rival, used International Women’s Day last week to urge companies to improve their board diversity. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has advocated governance reforms in annual letters to other CEOs, such as urging them to avoid too much focus on short-term results. BlackRock said it also plans to press boards about worker issues in light of matters such as uneven wage growth. Edkins pointed to Wal-Mart Stores Inc as an example of a company that embraced the idea that higher wages can lead to a more-engaged workforce. “Pay that doesn’t seem to achieve some sense of equity within a company is likely to make an unattractive place to work,” Edkins said.

Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, also told Reuters on the phone that markets need to see some kind of agreement on U.S. tax policy reforms by summertime. “The August recess is a very important date, and I think if we’re in the summer and it doesn’t look like we’re getting things done then risk markets, inflation markets would come under pressure,” he said. BlackRock managed more than $5.1 trillion in assets on Dec. 31. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months, but stocks and bonds both rallied as policymakers did not signal a plan to significantly accelerate the pace of monetary tightening. “If you have any concerns about them shocking the system from a rapid rate rise they were pretty clear that’s not coming,” he said.

Speeches by Fed officials after Feb. 1 pushed markets to conclude the most recent hike was all-but-inevitable and suggested they could embark on a more “hawkish” rate-hike trajectory to tamp inflation risks as U.S. President Donald Trump and his Republican party tout tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other fiscal stimulus measures.

1264,BLK,Hadas: The stakeholder revolution has been delayed,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - For fans of explicitly ethical stakeholder capitalism, Unilever’s rebuttal of a takeover approach by Kraft Heinz last month was a great moment. On one side, a company that made a big deal about thinking long term and creating good products as well as profit for shareholders. On the other, a business run by some of the harshest corporate cost-cutters around. With little more than a few phone calls, the Anglo-Dutch consumer product giant saw off the much smaller competitor. Virtue triumphs over vice. Of course, dividing companies into good and bad is too simple. Unilever is far too big, successful and traditional to be a total paragon. It is, after all, in the business of pushing sometimes unhealthy products to sometimes impressionable consumers. Kraft’s owners have a reputation for slashing costs, but then cutting waste and eliminating chronically unsuccessful lines of business can free up resources for better uses. But Paul Polman, Unilever’s chief executive, has reignited a battle between two philosophies of company ownership. The stakeholder approach says that a company is not really owned by shareholders, or at least not in the same way that an apartment is owned by a landlord. Providers of financial capital have a claim on its gains, but so do providers of labour, land, legal protection and technology. All these parties deserve a fair return – no less, but also no more. The other approach is crude but simple: if companies take care of shareholders, all the rest will fall into place. Proponents of the stakeholder vision say the sharing approach ought to benefit shareholders in the long term. If a crisis comes around, shareholders will be protected by the good will generated from the company’s earlier willingness to aim at much more than maximal short-term profitability. But companies do not always run into crises. And the payoff from being virtuous might take years, or decades – too long for today’s institutional investors, who often struggle to look past the next quarter, let alone thinking two years ahead. As Polman stands for the stakeholder, so Jorge Paulo Lemann is a fitting figurehead for the shareholder-value philosophy. He is the billionaire Brazilian investor behind Kraft Heinz, as well as brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev. Lemann has certainly done well for shareholders, starting with himself. He has exploited the fact that talk of the long term and serving stakeholders can be a mask for being fat and self-serving. His model has been to acquire businesses, promise large cost savings, and deliver even larger ones. In practice, companies land somewhere in the middle. Unilever is a sponsor of the research and lobby group FCLT – Focusing Capital on the Long Term. But Polman has not endorsed the full version of stakeholder capitalism. He could not afford to even if he is sympathetic, because shareholders are ultimately the ones with the power to turf him out. A genuine stakeholder vision of how a company should be managed would not really be shareholder-friendly. So Unilever’s victory is not necessarily good for shareholders, even in the long term, and the Kraft Heinz approach is not necessarily bad for society, even in the short term. That results in a conflict. McKinsey has found that most managers of companies in the S&P; 500 Index felt the pressure for short-term results has been increasing. And a separate study, also by McKinsey, said that companies that ignored this pressure have done substantially better for shareholders over the last decade. Unilever’s defence against Kraft Heinz suggests that a long-term corporate orientation, often with a hint of stakeholder thinking, is gaining traction. Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel seems persuaded. It cited the interests of “stakeholders” as one reason for rejecting two bids from American rival PPG Industries. The latest one, at $24 billion, was a generous-seeming 38 percent premium on Akzo’s undisturbed price. Shareholder value alone would have suggested it was worth a more serious hearing. On the other side, Lemann is on a roll. He co-invests with Warren Buffett, the ageing guru investor traditionally associated with very long-term thinking. And while Larry Fink, who runs giant investor BlackRock, backs FCLT, most institutional investors have become even more strongly committed to the narrowest and shortest-term sort of shareholder value. Which side will win? The election of Donald Trump, a businessman who generally ignored every stakeholder but himself, to the presidency of the United States might be a bad omen for the long-term cause. But Theresa May, the British prime minister whose approach to the European Union is as reactionary as the U.S. president’s approach to everything, is a proponent of treating workers as much more than a cost of doing business. A compromise could bring both sides victory. Let stakeholder enthusiasts admit the danger of entrenching self-serving behaviour, while short-termists and shareholder-only investors and managers lengthen and broaden their perspective. Such a consensus on corporate purpose could be vital. If investors and managers do not find an acceptable way forward, alienated voters may impose an unacceptable solution.",3222017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-companies-m-a-breakingviews/hadas-the-stakeholder-revolution-has-been-delayed-idUSKBN16T22A

1268,BLK,UPDATE 2-BlackRock cuts fees and jobs; stockpicking goes high-tech,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc on Tuesday said it would overhaul its actively managed equities business, cutting jobs, dropping fees and relying more on computers to pick stocks in a move that highlights how difficult it has become for humans to beat the market. The world’s biggest money manager has faced active stock fund withdrawals and the revamp is its biggest attempt yet to engineer a turnaround. Last May, BlackRock said it had recruited Mark Wiseman, the head of Canada’s biggest public pension fund, to oversee the stockpicking operations after he revamped that fund’s operations to embrace data-mining and other technological approaches to investing. BlackRock is rebranding or adjusting investment strategies on about 11 percent of its $275 billion active stock fund business, putting a greater emphasis on technology-driven investing approaches in the largest set of sweeping changes for the business since transformational mergers that allowed it to grow to manage more than $5 trillion in assets. Among the changes, BlackRock is removing some seven traditionalist “Fundamental” portfolio managers from their current assignments, according to a source familiar with the matter. More than 40 employees are being laid off, including some of the portfolio managers, according to another source. The company will also cut fees on some products that are being rebranded as an “Advantage” series of lower-cost active funds. Planned fee cuts on that group of funds and its “Income” products will slice about $30 million of BlackRock’s revenue, and the company will take a $25 million charge this quarter to reflect severance and other compensation expenses. The company said it will also expand its investments in data-mining techniques that it said can improve investment performance. Other funds are being refocused to take “high-conviction” bets on stocks. Active stock managers in the United States have been smacked with withdrawals in recent years as investors increasingly fled to lower-cost products, including index-tracking exchange-traded funds, some of which charge as little as $3 annually for every $10,000 they manage, while the average charged by U.S. stock mutual fund managers is $131, according to data for 2015 from the Investment Company Institute trade group. An industry bellwether, New York-based BlackRock also owns one of the most prized businesses in asset management, its iShares ETF franchise purchased from Barclays in 2009. Much of the company’s active stock franchise is from its 2006 acquisition of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers. The changes mark the latest of several attempts by BlackRock to boost an active fund business that represents nearly a third of its assets but an outsized near-50 percent of its fees. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has sometimes expressed disappointment in the performance of the company’s actively managed stock funds, and he has pivoted increasingly to focusing on the company’s data-driven “Scientific” equity teams. “It seems like the Vanguard approach to active equity management,” said Jason Kephart, senior analyst at Morningstar Inc, referring to the giant BlackRock rival that aggressively cuts fees and has also invested in tech-driven investment styles. “The easiest way to make an active strategy more attractive is just to charge less for it.” BlackRock’s equity overhaul also invites comparisons to  that of another major asset firm rival, Pacific Investment Management Co. In 2015, Pimco’s equity chief left and the Newport Beach, Calif firm liquidated two of its equity strategies after spending years attempting to diversify its investor base to include those buying equity products. BlackRock shares rose 1.50 percent to $380.63 per share on Tuesday before the announcement.

1270,BLK,UPDATE 1-BlackRock's Thiel says positive on pound but nervous over Brexit talks,"* Says risk of “hard Brexit” has increased * Says likes euro, but has French election protection (Updates with quotes, context) By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - BlackRock’s head of global bonds said on Wednesday he remains invested in the British pound but has concerns over whether Brexit negotiations can be completed within their two year deadline. British Prime Minister Theresa May will file formal Brexit divorce papers on Wednesday, starting a countdown to a divorce with the European Union in 2019. “My main concern is around the timeline for trying to get these things done as quickly as we can,” said Scott Thiel of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm. “We are still positive on sterling but there are still...risks,” he said, adding that the possibility of a “hard” Brexit if there is no agreement had increased. Investors’ main fear is that a “hard” Brexit — one in which Britain would lose preferential access with its largest trading partner — would hurt the British economy. The better-than-anticipated performance of the economy following last year’s referendum on EU membership has been a reason to be positive on sterling, Thiel said. Britain’s pound hit a two-month high of $1.2615 on Monday in a move driven chiefly by broader weakness of the dollar. But uncertainty surrounding the terms of Brexit continues to weigh on the currency, which is down almost 20 percent against the dollar since the Brexit vote. Thiel, who manages funds totalling about $41 billion assets under management, also said he likes the euro as an investment. He added, however, that he had bought so-called put options on the single currency to protect against any market ructions stemming from the upcoming French presidential election. A put option allows an investor the right but not the obligation to sell an asset at a later date and is often used as a hedge against risk. French presidential elections in April and May are viewed as a key event risk for financial markets as one of the leading contenders is the far-right, eurosceptic candidate, Marine Le Pen, who wants France to ditch the euro. “I like the euro generally but we have to recognise ... what we can’t possibly know, and we can’t possibly know the outcome of the French elections,” Thiel said. “Therefore I like to have downside option protection on the euro because if the French political situation were to go for the FN (Front National) then the euro would go significantly lower.” (Editing by Gareth Jones)",3292017,http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-blackrock/update-1-blackrocks-thiel-says-positive-on-pound-but-nervous-over-brexit-talks-idUSL5N1H62WJ
1271,BLK,BlackRock says positive on S.Africa bonds despite political noise,"LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - BlackRock remains positive on South African bonds despite signs of tensions within the government, the head of emerging debt at the world’s largest asset manager said on Wednesday, adding that investors would have to “live with” political noise. South African assets have sold off heavily this week on speculation the country’s finance minister would be removed from his post. Pravin Gordhan was ordered back home from an investor roadshow by President Jacob Zuma on Monday. But BlackRock’s Sergio Trigo Paz said he remained “long” on South African debt, noting that the central bank has room to cut interest rates. “There will be noise in South Africa but we will have to live with it,” Trigo Paz told a briefing in London.

1273,BLK,BlackRock cuts fees and jobs; stockpicking goes high-tech,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc on Tuesday said it would overhaul its actively managed equities business, cutting jobs, dropping fees and relying more on computers to pick stocks in a move that highlights how difficult it has become for humans to beat the market. The world’s biggest money manager has faced active stock fund withdrawals and the revamp is its biggest attempt yet to engineer a turnaround. Last May, BlackRock said it had recruited Mark Wiseman, the head of Canada’s biggest public pension fund, to oversee the stockpicking operations after he revamped that fund’s operations to embrace data-mining and other technological approaches to investing. BlackRock is rebranding or adjusting investment strategies on about 11 percent of its $275 billion active stock fund business, putting a greater emphasis on technology-driven investing approaches in the largest set of sweeping changes for the business since transformational mergers that allowed it to grow to manage more than $5 trillion in assets. Among the changes, BlackRock is removing some seven traditionalist “Fundamental” portfolio managers from their current assignments, according to a source familiar with the matter. More than 40 employees are being laid off, including some of the portfolio managers, according to another source. The company will also cut fees on some products that are being rebranded as an “Advantage” series of lower-cost active funds. Planned fee cuts on that group of funds and its “Income” products will slice about $30 million of BlackRock’s revenue, and the company will take a $25 million charge this quarter to reflect severance and other compensation expenses. The company said it will also expand its investments in data-mining techniques that it said can improve investment performance. Other funds are being refocused to take “high-conviction” bets on stocks. Active stock managers in the United States have been smacked with withdrawals in recent years as investors increasingly fled to lower-cost products, including index-tracking exchange-traded funds, some of which charge as little as $3 annually for every $10,000 they manage, while the average charged by U.S. stock mutual fund managers is $131, according to data for 2015 from the Investment Company Institute trade group. An industry bellwether, New York-based BlackRock also owns one of the most prized businesses in asset management, its iShares ETF franchise purchased from Barclays in 2009. Much of the company’s active stock franchise is from its 2006 acquisition of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers. The changes mark the latest of several attempts by BlackRock to boost an active fund business that represents nearly a third of its assets but an outsized near-50 percent of its fees. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has sometimes expressed disappointment in the performance of the company’s actively managed stock funds, and he has pivoted increasingly to focusing on the company’s data-driven “Scientific” equity teams. “It seems like the Vanguard approach to active equity management,” said Jason Kephart, senior analyst at Morningstar Inc, referring to the giant BlackRock rival that aggressively cuts fees and has also invested in tech-driven investment styles. “The easiest way to make an active strategy more attractive is just to charge less for it.” BlackRock’s equity overhaul also invites comparisons to  that of another major asset firm rival, Pacific Investment Management Co. In 2015, Pimco’s equity chief left and the Newport Beach, Calif firm liquidated two of its equity strategies after spending years attempting to diversify its investor base to include those buying equity products. BlackRock shares rose 1.50 percent to $380.63 per share on Tuesday before the announcement.

1274,BLK,Analysis -BlackRock's active gambit ups pressure on rivals,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s decision to revamp part of its stock-picking business puts further pressure on active U.S. equity managers to cut fees, change products and merge to stem a relentless, 12-year decline in assets. BlackRock is replacing a handful of portfolio managers and doubling down on an investment in computer models and data science to boost returns and cut fees. The moves affect about 11 percent of its $275 billion active stock fund business but are a drop in the ocean for the company, the world’s largest asset manager. Roughly two-thirds of its $5 trillion in assets under management and half its fee income come from index-tracking funds and exchange-traded funds, products investors are flocking to for superior returns and cheaper management fees. For rivals heavily reliant on active stock pickers, hiring computer geniuses to develop investing models and spending more on data mining may not be a cost-effective way of boosting performance. Axing portfolio managers can also trigger investor withdrawals. “This is a little experiment for BlackRock but bad news for a lot of players in the market,” said Kyle Sanders, a stock analyst for Edward Jones. The pain could be concentrated among smaller, active fund managers reliant on fleet-footed retail investors. Mangers of larger funds can put more money into their investment process and tend to have more institutional clients willing to endure a period of underperformance. But even larger companies are at risk. Analysts at Morgan Stanley see Franklin Resources Inc , home to the Franklin Templeton stable of funds, as one of the most exposed to fee cuts, because its assets are skewed toward the retail brokerage channel. “Over the next three years, we see the management fee rate compressing by 12 percent, leading to revenue degradation of -18 percent,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a recent note. Franklin Templeton, the No. 5 mutual fund company in the United States by assets, did not respond to a request for comment. In its most recent quarter, Franklin Templeton’s assets fell 6 percent from the year prior, while operating revenue fell by 11 percent. For the wider industry, Morgan Stanley analysts’ base case is fee compression of 10 percent to 15 percent and more than 25 percent in its bear case. “We foresee a multi-year adjustment process that will affect the earnings and shares of publicly traded traditional asset managers,” Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Cyprys said in a separate, recent research note. He added that fee cuts and product re-engineering could drive some companies to go private “and usher in an era of large-scale consolidation – not without risks.” Consolidation is already happening. Janus Capital Group Inc agreed in October to sell itself to UK-based Henderson Group Plc for $2.6 billion. Anglo-South African financial services firm Old Mutual this month sold a 25 percent stake in its U.S. fund management arm to China’s HNA for $446 million. Actively managed U.S. stock funds have not reported a year of net inflows since 2005, according to Morningstar. Over the past 12 months alone, fund companies including household names such as American Funds, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price Group Inc have endured withdrawals totaling $131.8 billion, the research service said. By comparison, index-fund pioneer Vanguard Group attracted $342 billion in the United States, much of it into its passively managed index funds and exchange-traded funds. A look at industry fees helps explain why. Despite a 15 percent drop in U.S. equity fund fees in the decade ending in 2015, mutual fund managers on average still charge $131 for every $10,000 they manage, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. Vanguard’s U.S. stock funds fees average $18, according to Morningstar. Despite their higher costs, just 14 percent of active broad-market, large-cap stock funds beat their passive counterparts over 10 years through 2016. American Funds defended its strategy. Low-fee shares of its largest fund, the $155 billion Growth Fund of America, beat most of its peers over five years, according to Thomson Reuters’ Lipper unit. “We are and will always be an investment management company first, run by people with deep expertise and phenomenal track records - enabled by some of the world’s leading next-generation technology,” an American Funds spokeswoman said in a statement. Fidelity said individual active managers continued to beat the market. “The active/passive debate usually focuses on the industry as a whole and the performance of the average active manager, but as with every industry there are some that are better than others,” a Fidelity spokesman said in an email. Will Danoff, one of Fidelity’s best stock pickers, experienced one of his worst years as a portfolio manager in 2016 when his $107 billion Contrafund trailed the S&P; 500 Index by nearly 9 percentage points. But so far in 2017, Danoff is working the magic that has been the rule during his nearly 27 years managing investor money. Contrafund’s year-to-date total return of 10.3 percent is easily beating the S&P; 500 by nearly 4 percentage points. T. Rowe Price declined to comment. For its part, BlackRock’s actively managed equity business posted $20.2 billion in outflows last year, according to its earnings report. Its move to a quantitative focus underscores the eroding confidence in the ability of humans to pick large-cap stocks that outperform benchmarks such as the S&P; 500. Analysts say, however, the industry will have a chance to prove its worth if there is a stock market correction. “When (markets) are all going up at once, and all sectors are firing on all cylinders, you’re fine to be all-passive,” said Tom Roseen, senior analyst for Lipper. “But when markets are tanking, if they make the right bets, then we’ll see (some) active mutual funds beating passive, but we won’t see that at all of them.” (Additional reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston)",3312017,http://www.reuters.com/article/funds-active-blackrock/analysis-blackrocks-active-gambit-ups-pressure-on-rivals-idUSL2N1H8244

1276,BLK,BlackRock's big funds cut commission rates for Wall Street research,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s biggest asset manager, slashed the amount it paid out in commissions to Wall Street firms for research by more than half for its largest mutual fund over the last two years, according to filings. The cuts show the immense power large asset managers have to curb fees they pay banks and the diminishing role of sell-side research at a time when Wall Street firms are facing a slump in stock trading commissions. BlackRock’s $40 billion Global Allocation Fund (MALOX.O) paid out $13.4 million in commissions in the 2016 fiscal year for trades tied to research, compared with $28.8 million two years earlier. The commissions fell even though the BlackRock fund routed roughly the same level of transactions to brokerages in exchange for access to their research notes and other related services. The same pattern is true for other big BlackRock funds, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings from three of BlackRock’s five largest funds. Some of those funds paid out more in total commissions, but trading activity in those funds increased to a greater degree, meaning that the actual commission rate fell. A BlackRock spokeswoman declined to comment. In announcing an overhaul of its actively managed equities business last week, BlackRock said it was “harnessing the power of ‘human and machine,’” relying more on computers and data-mining to pick stocks. Equities revenue, which includes executing stock trades and buying and selling derivatives related to stocks, is slumping across Wall Street. In 2016, equities revenue across the world’s biggest banks declined 13 percent, to the lowest level since 2012, according to research provider Coalition. The outlook is not expected to improve. For the first quarter of 2017, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) predicts equities revenue across the industry fell 3 percent year-over-year, compared with gains of over 20 percent in both investment banking and bond trading. Structural changes to the equities business over the last several years, such as the rise of electronic trading, have knocked off around $15 billion from the equities fee pool, according to a report from Morgan Stanley and management consulting firm Oliver Wyman.  Electronic trading has dramatically increased trading volumes, while making the cost of trading much cheaper. Oliver Wyman partner Christian Edelmann, who co-authored the report, does not see those revenues coming back. “Once the equities model has become technology driven, that’s not going to change,” he said.  Other factors are expected to strain the equities business further.  Asset managers including BlackRock, which last week also said it would cut jobs and fees in its active equities business, are under enormous pressure due to weak returns and competition from low-cost options like index funds. The fee squeeze is making firms more selective about how they spend research dollars. At the same time, the long-running practice of paying for research through trading commissions is being upended by new regulations in Europe, known as the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.  Part of the overhaul will force investors in the European Union to pay for research directly, meaning banks will be required to put price tags on their proprietary analysis. Global asset managers are expected to “unbundle” payments in other regions as well. Asset managers and hedge funds typically determine their research budgets through a process called broker votes in which portfolio managers rate the value of equity research analysts. The broker vote helps firms decide which research providers to keep and how to allocate their research dollars. Asset managers have gained leverage because they have an increasing variety of choices of trading venues and research providers, including independent firms unaffiliated with the big banks. And a push for high-value ideas has caused some to build up more research capabilities in-house. Banks are doing what they can to keep their research products relevant, such as employing more data scientists to support research from traditional stock analysts. Banks have already been trimming their research budgets. Spending on research at the top investment banks fell by just over half to $4 billion in 2016 from $8.2 billion in 2008, according to Frost Consulting. BlackRock has managed to keep its funds’ spending on commissions for research under control. Spending on commissions by its $21 billion Equity Dividend Fund (MRDVX.O) increased by 39 percent from the 2014 to 2016 fiscal years, but the fund’s transaction activity more than doubled, meaning that its commission rate overall decreased considerably. The commission rate paid for research by BlackRock’s nearly $15 billion Multi-Asset Income Fund (BKMIX.O) also fell over the 2014 to 2016 fiscal years, plunging by nearly 41 percent. One of BlackRock’s five largest funds has not yet disclosed 2016 data, while another does not direct trades to brokerages in exchange for research. The funds use the brokerage services of major banks such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan. The filings does not identify which of the banks provide research to BlackRock.

1278,BLK,Blackrock among those seeking to block Novo Banco-Lone Star deal,"(Reuters) - Blackrock and other asset management institutions are seeking  an injunction this week to block the sale of Portugal’s Novo Banco to U.S. private equity firm Lone Star. “The rules governing the sales process are discriminatory and breach Portuguese and EU law,” the fund managers, which included Blackrock, said in an email statement. The names of other financial institutions were not mentioned. The Bank of Portugal in 2015 had transferred bonds from “good bank” Novo Banco to Banco Espirito Santo (BES) to boost Novo Banco’s balance sheet by 1.98 billion euros ($2.11 billion). Novo Banco was created from BES in August 2014 after a 4.9 billion euro rescue. The bond transfer had caused losses of about 1.5 billion for ordinary retail investors and pensioners and a group representing more than two-thirds of the transferred notes had begun legal proceedings against the Bank of Portugal, the statement said.

1283,BLK,BlackRock sees Singapore office market improving as supply tapers,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N) said the worst was over for Singapore’s office property market with supply tapering off, and that elsewhere in Asia Pacific, the world’s largest asset manager was looking to raise its real estate exposure in Japan and Australia. Prime office rents in Singapore’s financial district dropped by more than 10 percent in the past two years due to oversupply, making it one of the worst performing major Asian markets. But the outlook is improving with analysts expecting limited new developments until 2021 after some constructions this year. “You get short supply and demand holds up, then all of a sudden rents start going up. We are already past that inflection point in Singapore,” John Saunders, Asia-Pacific head at BlackRock Real Estate, told Reuters on Thursday.  “We are starting to see it become more of a landlord’s market and we are starting to see rents move again and that makes it very attractive,” he said, adding the firm was mulling investments in malls and industrial assets in Singapore. He said a tighter Chinese grip on capital outflows was not having a major impact on real estate investments, as most purchases from the mainland were outside Asia. BlackRock is looking to buy more office properties in Japan and retail assets in Australia, where it recently invested in an office complex, he said. Asia Pacific accounts for about 30 percent of the $21 billion in assets under management at BlackRock Real Estate. The office segment is top ranked in its portfolio, followed by retail, residential and industrial sectors. In Singapore, BlackRock last year sold its 43-storey office building, Asia Square Tower 1, for $2.5 billion to Qatar Investment Authority in what was the city state’s largest ever office transaction. The U.S. firm hailed the deal as indicating gloomy views about the market were likely overdone. But others have been less optimistic, with Singapore ranked 21st out of 22 Asia Pacific real estate markets for investment prospects in a recent survey by PwC and Urban Land Institute. Saunders, however, highlighted strong investment interest in Singapore from funds and corporates.  “There’s competition from all around - funds, domestic capital and there’s also non-domestic Asian capital,” he said. He said BlackRock’s remaining tower, also in the Asia Square development and nearly 95 percent occupied, was “a very sought after asset”, but declined to comment on a potential sale.

1292,BLK,"Amid business ties, some fund firms eased proxy pressure -study","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several big fund firms supported challenges on executive pay or  climate disclosures less frequently where they had business ties to energy companies and utilities, according to a new study released on Tuesday. The scrutiny of firms including Vanguard Group and Invesco Ltd is the latest research to raise questions about how well they manage potential conflicts of interest when casting proxy votes at the same time they are trying to win work like running corporate retirement plans. “The business relationships seem to have an impact on how the managers are voting,” said Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 Climate Project. The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, which issued the report, looks to help investors and corporations work on issues like climate change. Fund firms often are the largest shareholders of publicly traded U.S. firms, giving their votes outsized influence. Meanwhile climate and other governance matters promise to be hot topics in the shareholder meeting season this spring after Vanguard, BlackRock Inc and others have revised their policies on the area. For its study 50/50 reviewed how fund firms voted on 27 proxy questions last year at oil and gas companies and utilities, tracking how often they voted against management recommendations. At Vanguard, for instance, 50/50 found the $4 trillion Pennsylvania index fund manager broke from management 22 percent of the time. But at four companies where Vanguard serviced retirement plans, its funds did not support any challenges. The votes could have mattered such as at Chevron Corp where 46 percent of votes cast opposed top executives’ pay and Vanguard owned 6 percent of shares. Vanguard funds also opposed a resolution calling for Chevron to disclose the business impact of a rise in global temperatures, which won 41 percent support.   Vanguard spokeswoman Arianna Stefanoni Sherlock called the concerns raised by the study “unfounded” and said its voting operations are independent of its servicing work.  Vanguard changed its voting policies this year to leave itself more room to support environmental measures that create long-term shareholder value. Sherlock said the update was meant to showed the types of proposals it might support, and to eliminate abstentions. Another fund firm, Invesco, broke with management 12 percent of the time, and at none of seven companies where it had business ties. Invesco spokeswoman Jeaneen Terrio said where a conflict of interest may exist it will vote by policy or by a committee that excludes marketing and other customer-facing personnel.

1293,BLK,UPDATE 5-Booming ETFs help BlackRock weather investors' cost-cutting,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s biggest asset manager, on Wednesday reported double-digit profit gains as investors plowed money into lower-cost index funds, but the company’s share price slipped as revenue fell short of analysts’ expectations. For graphic on BlackRock’s growth paradox, click: tmsnrt.rs/2pDik4d Revenues of $2.8 billion came in 2 percent below analysts’ estimates as advisory and distribution fees declined. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the miss was not attributable to the fees it charges for managing funds. Nonetheless, while BlackRock’s assets grew 22 percent from a year ago to $5.4 trillion, fees for managing those assets and lending out the securities grew by a smaller 12 percent. “There is a greater belief that long-term returns are structurally lower than they were 10 and 20 years ago,” Fink told analysts on a conference call. “Fees take up a lot of that return. And as long as we believe the world is going to be in a low-return environment, our clients are under a lot of pressure. BlackRock shares closed down 1.7 percent. “They have a history of exceeding expectations,” said Macrae Sykes, an analyst at Gabelli & Co, which owns BlackRock shares. “This quarter they didn’t.” Investors poured $82.2 billion into its index funds and iShares exchange-traded funds during the first quarter, while its pricier active funds posted $1.8 billion in withdrawals. Financial markets traded vibrantly last quarter as a new U.S. president and congress took office, and investors tried to size up whether they would pass tax and other reforms that could give new life to an aging bull market in U.S. stocks. Investors increasingly are choosing to make those bets - whether optimistic or pessimistic - using ETFs that track indexes at a relatively low cost. Very few companies in the industry have been able to build a successful index fund franchise like iShares, and the flight of customers to lower-cost products has consequently squeezed margins. BlackRock’s net income rose to $862 million, or $5.23 per share as its tax rate declined in the first quarter ended March 31, from $657 million, or $3.92 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned $5.25 per share, beating the $4.89 estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Last quarter, iShares and index funds brought in all of the net money that went into the BlackRock’s “long-term” products, a grouping that excludes funds where investors park cash. BlackRock has been pushing investors to use ETFs more often and in new ways. ETFs were initially seen as devices used to track stock indexes. But BlackRock has aggressively marketed fixed-income ETFs to institutions that normally use bonds. That approach paid off. U.S.-based bond ETFs attracted record cash last quarter, according to researcher Morningstar Inc, and iShares took in $4 in $10 of that money. BlackRock also created a low-cost lineup of 25 “Core” ETFs for everyday investors to use to build a basic portfolio. The funds compete on price with BlackRock’s most aggressive price-slashing rivals, Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Those 25 Core ETFs accounted for 54 percent of iShares inflows last quarter. Yet success in that category has come at the cost of lowering fees, which BlackRock last did for Core in October. In a sign of how high the bar is for growing in the ETF business, iShares’ share of U.S. assets in that business has actually decreased to 39 percent, from a peak under BlackRock ownership of 47 percent. BlackRock bought iShares from Barclays PLC (BARC.L) in 2009. Last month, BlackRock said it would cut jobs and fees while relying more on computers to assemble its investment portfolios, a flurry of changes meant to jumpstart its lagging stockpicking franchise. The changes affect 11 percent of its $275 billion active stock fund business. By BlackRock’s own figures, 51 percent of assets in its traditionalist “Fundamental” active stock funds are lagging their benchmark over five years. That compares to 90 percent for BlackRock’s data-driven “Scientific” funds and 88 percent for its taxable-bond funds. It remains to be seen what effect the new changes will have. All else equal, cutting fees boosts performance. But transferring management of some traditionalist funds to Scientific teams comes with its own risks, including scaring away existing investors, and creating a new reliance on computer models that may not deliver in increasingly competitive markets. “They can’t do anything about the environment for active management,” said Tom Brakke, who consults asset managers.

1294,BLK,BlackRock CEO Fink sees wave of M&A; in asset management industry,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, who runs the world’s largest asset manager, on Wednesday forecast a wave of mergers and acquisitions in asset management, but said his company may be limited for now to small deals. “I believe you’re going to see a consolidation in our industry,” Fink told Reuters in a telephone interview, citing previous waves in industries such as banking. Even so, he said, “We’re not going to be a big participant” in M&A.; He did say BlackRock is considering three or four small acquisitions that would be focused on shoring up the company’s technology and its investment expertise in different assets and geographic regions. Started as a bond-focused fund manager in 1988, BlackRock later used acquisitions to add index-tracking exchange-traded funds and equities to its menu of offerings. Yet its traditionalist stock-picking unit has remained a source of frustration. BlackRock’s earnings reported on Wednesday showed it attracted nearly $65 billion in new cash from clients in the first quarter, while many of its peers have been trying to stanch outflows. BlackRock oversees $5.4 trillion in assets. The massive inflows at BlackRock raise the prospect that an industry that has nurtured dozens of brand names from Fidelity Investments to Pacific Investment Management Co is increasingly turning into a winner-take-all game. BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp (STT.N) captured nearly 72 percent of the net cash collected globally last year by mutual funds, money market funds and exchange-traded funds, according to Morningstar Inc. “Asset managers historically benefited - in most cases, they benefited - from rising beta so you didn’t have this need for consolidation,” said Fink, referring to how rising markets boosted asset managers’ earnings. The next leg of growth may be harder, including M&A; and developing new business lines. Fink has placed an unusual emphasis on technology for an asset manager. BlackRock added revenue by licensing its Aladdin operating system for money managers to its rivals. The company is also exploring how computer models can improve stock picking while reducing costs. Last month, BlackRock announced plans to transfer some responsibilities from more traditionalist fund managers to an internal team known for data-driven approaches to picking stocks. In the interview, Fink said he has “100 percent confidence” that approach will help performance. The company’s overhaul of its active equities franchise includes doubling-down on niche geographic specialties, such as Asia, where it may have a greater chance to beat the market.

Nonetheless, while BlackRock’s assets grew 22 percent from a year ago to $5.4 trillion, fees for managing those assets and lending out the securities grew by a smaller 12 percent. “There is a greater belief that long-term returns are structurally lower than they were 10 and 20 years ago,” Fink told analysts on a conference call. “Fees take up a lot of that return. And as long as we believe the world is going to be in a low-return environment, our clients are under a lot of pressure. BlackRock shares closed down 1.7 percent. “They have a history of exceeding expectations,” said Macrae Sykes, an analyst at Gabelli & Co, which owns BlackRock shares. “This quarter they didn’t.” Investors poured $82.2 billion into its index funds and iShares exchange-traded funds during the first quarter, while its pricier active funds posted $1.8 billion in withdrawals. Financial markets traded vibrantly last quarter as a new U.S. president and congress took office, and investors tried to size up whether they would pass tax and other reforms that could give new life to an aging bull market in U.S. stocks. Investors increasingly are choosing to make those bets - whether optimistic or pessimistic - using ETFs that track indexes at a relatively low cost. Very few companies in the industry have been able to build a successful index fund franchise like iShares, and the flight of customers to lower-cost products has consequently squeezed margins. BlackRock’s net income rose to $862 million, or $5.23 per share as its tax rate declined in the first quarter ended March 31, from $657 million, or $3.92 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned $5.25 per share, beating the $4.89 estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Last quarter, iShares and index funds brought in all of the net money that went into the BlackRock’s “long-term” products, a grouping that excludes funds where investors park cash. BlackRock has been pushing investors to use ETFs more often and in new ways. ETFs were initially seen as devices used to track stock indexes. But BlackRock has aggressively marketed fixed-income ETFs to institutions that normally use bonds. That approach paid off. U.S.-based bond ETFs attracted record cash last quarter, according to researcher Morningstar Inc, and iShares took in $4 in $10 of that money. BlackRock also created a low-cost lineup of 25 “Core” ETFs for everyday investors to use to build a basic portfolio. The funds compete on price with BlackRock’s most aggressive price-slashing rivals, Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Those 25 Core ETFs accounted for 54 percent of iShares inflows last quarter. Yet success in that category has come at the cost of lowering fees, which BlackRock last did for Core in October. In a sign of how high the bar is for growing in the ETF business, iShares’ share of U.S. assets in that business has actually decreased to 39 percent, from a peak under BlackRock ownership of 47 percent. BlackRock bought iShares from Barclays PLC (BARC.L) in 2009. Last month, BlackRock said it would cut jobs and fees while relying more on computers to assemble its investment portfolios, a flurry of changes meant to jumpstart its lagging stockpicking franchise. The changes affect 11 percent of its $275 billion active stock fund business. By BlackRock’s own figures, 51 percent of assets in its traditionalist “Fundamental” active stock funds are lagging their benchmark over five years. That compares to 90 percent for BlackRock’s data-driven “Scientific” funds and 88 percent for its taxable-bond funds. It remains to be seen what effect the new changes will have. All else equal, cutting fees boosts performance. But transferring management of some traditionalist funds to Scientific teams comes with its own risks, including scaring away existing investors, and creating a new reliance on computer models that may not deliver in increasingly competitive markets. “They can’t do anything about the environment for active management,” said Tom Brakke, who consults asset managers.

BlackRock earlier reported a 31 percent jump in quarterly profit and Larry Fink said he was particularly pleased about the broad-based nature of demand, with net inflows across all product areas, client types and regions.    While second-quarter flows into BlackRock’s funds were positive, investors were now looking for company earnings to justify further stock market gains, he told Bloomberg TV. Fink also said the firm was looking at three or four tech-related acquisitions, without giving details.

1301,BLK,BlackRock CEO Fink sees wave of M&A; in asset management industry,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, who runs the world’s largest asset manager, on Wednesday forecast a wave of mergers and acquisitions in asset management, but said his company may be limited for now to small deals. “I believe you’re going to see a consolidation in our industry,” Fink told Reuters in a telephone interview, citing previous waves in industries such as banking. Even so, he said, “We’re not going to be a big participant” in M&A.; He did say BlackRock is considering three or four small acquisitions that would be focused on shoring up the company’s technology and its investment expertise in different assets and geographic regions. Started as a bond-focused fund manager in 1988, BlackRock later used acquisitions to add index-tracking exchange-traded funds and equities to its menu of offerings. Yet its traditionalist stock-picking unit has remained a source of frustration. BlackRock’s earnings reported on Wednesday showed it attracted nearly $65 billion in new cash from clients in the first quarter, while many of its peers have been trying to stanch outflows. BlackRock oversees $5.4 trillion in assets. The massive inflows at BlackRock raise the prospect that an industry that has nurtured dozens of brand names from Fidelity Investments to Pacific Investment Management Co is increasingly turning into a winner-take-all game. BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp (STT.N) captured nearly 72 percent of the net cash collected globally last year by mutual funds, money market funds and exchange-traded funds, according to Morningstar Inc. “Asset managers historically benefited - in most cases, they benefited - from rising beta so you didn’t have this need for consolidation,” said Fink, referring to how rising markets boosted asset managers’ earnings. The next leg of growth may be harder, including M&A; and developing new business lines. Fink has placed an unusual emphasis on technology for an asset manager. BlackRock added revenue by licensing its Aladdin operating system for money managers to its rivals. The company is also exploring how computer models can improve stock picking while reducing costs. Last month, BlackRock announced plans to transfer some responsibilities from more traditionalist fund managers to an internal team known for data-driven approaches to picking stocks. In the interview, Fink said he has “100 percent confidence” that approach will help performance. The company’s overhaul of its active equities franchise includes doubling-down on niche geographic specialties, such as Asia, where it may have a greater chance to beat the market.

1302,BLK,BlackRock to pay $1.5 million to settle SEC charges over Russian ETF,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A unit of asset manager BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) will pay $1.5 million to settle a complaint that it launched a Russian exchange-traded fund without proper regulatory approval, according to U.S. regulators.

Exchange-traded funds are an investment vehicle that own an array of stocks and bonds and trade in real time on public exchanges.  Legal requirements governing mutual funds require that they seek a special exemption from the SEC before launching new ETFs.

The firm, majority-owned by France’s AXA SA, named JPMorgan Asset Management executive Seth Bernstein as its new CEO and Robert Zoellick, previously president of the World Bank and a former Goldman Sachs executive, as chairman. Kraus, who held the CEO and chairman titles since 2008, was “terminated” from his job as CEO, according to a securities filing. AllianceBernstein, with $497.9 billion in assets under management at the end of March, gave no hint of changes in the works when it reported earnings on Thursday. A spokesman declined to comment on the reason for the changes. AllianceBernstein shares fell 2.4 percent to $22.35. Kraus took over as CEO and chairman in 2008, just as the financial crisis gripped Wall Street. He helped shepherd the firm in the difficult years after the crisis, but it has not fully recovered. AllianceBernstein’s assets of $497.9 billion are well below the $800.4 billion it managed at the end of 2007. It is now dwarfed by companies with a stronger lineup of passive investment products such as BlackRock Inc, which ran $5.4 trillion at the end of March. On a conference call on Monday morning, AXA Board Chairman Denis Duverne thanked Kraus for his service as CEO. “After eight years, we decided it was time to put in new leadership,” Duverne said during the call.

In a note to investors Jefferies analysts wrote the shake-up “produces more questions than answers” and that the new management structure may signal a closer alignment between AllianceBernstein and AXA, where six board members now have ties. AXA executives cited a changed industry since Kraus came in,  the Jefferies analysts wrote, implying that “AXA disagreed with the strategy being pursued by the previous management team and did not want to wait until the end of Peter’s contract to make changes as industry headwinds are only accelerating.”  Citigroup William Katz wrote however the change may not reflect strategic or financial issues because management had little other news, and that “potentially personal conflict drove the sudden change.” Kraus had given no indication of changes ahead. On a conference call after the company’s earnings last week, he said: “We’ve focused for years on rebuilding our presence and regaining relevance with retail clients and are finally where we need to be.” Kraus has entered into a “cooperation agreement” with AllianceBernstein, under which he is entitled to termination benefits and salary, according to the filing.

1314,BLK,European markets to benefit most from global upswing -Blackrock's Hildebrand,"LUXEMBOURG, May 5 (Reuters) - The continued global economic expansion offers an “extraordinary window of opportunity” for investors, particularly in European markets that haven’t yet fully priced in the positive outlook, Blackrock vice chairman Philipp Hildebrand said on Friday. Investors are underestimating the positive impact of the synchronised reflation trend that is helping to lift global asset prices, he said, noting that Europe is also benefiting from substantial European Central Bank stimulus. “Europe has more upside potential than perhaps any other region in the world today,” Hildebrand told delegates at the International Capital Markets Association annual general meeting in Luxembourg. “Growth has returned and deflation risks have successfully been fought off. It’s an extraordinary window of opportunity.” The euro zone economy grew nearly three times faster than the U.S. economy in the first quarter, and consumer and business confidence is surging. Earnings growth is in double-digits and corporate deal-making is near record levels. European equity funds are poised to recoup the $100 billion of investor flows that left the region last year, analysts say. Hildebrand said investors tend to underestimate the strength of synchronised inflation and growth trends, both on the upside and the downside. He said he is hopeful that U.S. capital expenditure and productivity are finally turning the corner after years of sluggish performance - “two missing pieces” that would cement the U.S. recovery and the same globally. That said, investors shouldn’t get carried away, said Hildebrand, vice chairman of the world’s asset manager. Debt levels globally are higher today than they were before the financial crisis, ageing populations are putting a huge strain on government finances in the developed world, and productivity growth in most advanced economies remains weak. “Add all that together ... and it’s hard to see a return to the golden days before the crisis,” he said.

BlackRock cut total compensation for Fink by 1 percent to $25.5 million in 2016, according to a filing last month based on a calculation of his pay in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. “The Company has been deficient in aligning pay with performance,” Glass Lewis said in the report.

1318,BLK,BlackRock switch helps pass 'historic' climate measure at Occidental,"BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Friday that it voted in favor of a successful shareholder proposal calling for more climate change reporting by Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), in the first sign the world’s largest asset manager was backing up its tough new talk on environmental matters.     Backers of the resolution called its passage a major victory, the first time such a measure succeeded at a major U.S. oil and gas company. Proponents said they were pleased by BlackRock’s support, which they had sought.     “Today’s historic vote puts the oil and gas industry on notice – the climate is changing and so are investor expectations of how companies should respond,” said Laura Campos, a director at the Nathan Cummings Foundation, one of the resolution’s proponents.     BlackRock (BLK.N), which has $5.4 trillion under management, traditionally has given few details of its reasoning behind specific proxy votes. On Friday, however, it said it was concerned about Occidental’s pace of disclosure to date. It also gave details about its talks with other companies such as Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which BlackRock said has provided more detail on climate risks it faces such as a recent report it published. A Chevron representative said the company would continue speaking with investors, and that it had held “extensive dialogue with proponents and other stockholders.”     BlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney said BlackRock would not explain every vote it casts in such detail but wanted to underscore how it promotes its corporate governance priorities in talks with companies.     “We want to highlight our engagement and articulate our voting decisions,” he said.     Occidental Chairman Eugene Batchelder said in an emailed statement: “We look forward to continuing our shareholder engagement on the topic and providing additional disclosure about the company’s assessment and management of climate-related risks and opportunities.” Major oil companies have long faced shareholder criticism for being slow to respond to climate concerns, though some have moved to mend fences with activists in recent years such as ExxonMobil’s (XOM.N) decision earlier this year to name a environmental expert to its board.     Specifically, the resolution at Occidental - which was also backed by Wespath Investment Management and state pension funds including the California Public Employees’ Retirement System - called on the energy company to explain the impact it could face from changes like new public policies on climate change, such as the 2016 Paris climate agreement.     BlackRock, Occidental’s largest investor with about 8 percent of its shares, last year had opposed a similar resolution, which failed to get a majority of support from investors.      In a statement sent by Sweeney explaining the switch, the fund firm said its vote last year was meant to give Occidental time. But despite talks with Occidental, “we remain concerned about the lack of discernable improvements to the company’s reporting practices” on climate issues, the statement said.     Last year a similar resolution was narrowly defeated with 249 million votes cast for it and 259 million votes cast against. The size of BlackRock’s holdings suggested its switch helped give the proposal a majority of support this year. An Occidental spokesman said the company would provide details about the vote in coming days.

The comments by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, also marked a more detailed level of explanation than it has traditionally offered for its proxy votes, which could make it even more influential. BlackRock, a major Occidental investor, last year had opposed a similar shareholder resolution, which failed to get a majority of support from investors.

1321,BLK,UPDATE 1-Snap surges after Wall Street heavyweights reveal stakes,"SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) jumped more than 8 percent on Monday in its second strongest day since the social media company’s initial public offering, boosted by filings showing several institutional investors had owned its shares. The filings provided the first definitive snapshot of who bought Snap shares when it went public in early March. Its stock had plummeted 23 percent late on Wednesday after its debut quarterly earnings report disappointed investors. Coatue Management LLC, Soros Fund Management LLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Jana Partners LLC on Monday joined the list of fund managers disclosing stakes in the parent of the popular Snapchat messaging app at the end of March. Snap’s high valuation, lack of profitability and slowing user growth have made it a controversial stock on Wall Street. Its IPO was the hottest technology offering since Facebook’s in 2012. Snap’s stock is valued at 44 times the company’s expected sales for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters data. By comparison, Facebook (FB.O) trades at 14 times expected sales, and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) is at 7 times expected sales. Tech-oriented hedge fund Coatue took a nearly 21 million share stake in Snap. Soros Fund Management, run by 86-year-old billionaire George Soros, took a nearly 1.7 million stake in Snap during the first quarter. Goldman meanwhile took a 1.1 million share stake in the newly public company, and also held put and call options on 1.6 million shares. Most of the long position was assigned to the company’s asset management subsidiary, while the other positions are held by one of its broker-dealer subsidiaries. Goldman was a lead underwriter on the Snap IPO. Activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC also took a 550,000-share stake in Snap. Coatue declined to comment, while the other three companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Daniel Loeb’s Third Point, Daniel Och’s Och-Ziff Capital Management (OZM.N), and world’s largest asset manager BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) on Friday disclosed Snap holdings at the end of March. The disclosures to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in what are known as 13F filings, offer clues on what big investors are selling and buying, but give no indication of their current stakes. Snap closed up 8.36 percent on the day at $20.74, higher than its $17 IPO price but down almost 30 percent from its highest trading price on March 3.

1323,BLK,"CORRECTED-Betterment adds Labor department, BlackRock experts to 401(k) plan board","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Robo-adviser Betterment, in a push to try to get more big companies to sign on to its 401(k) plan, beefed up the board of advisers of its retirement product on Friday by adding two leaders in the movement for cutting investment costs for companies and employees. The digital financial services company added former U.S. Labor Department retirement policy expert Judy Mares and former BlackRock consultant Laraine McKinnon to the board of Betterment for Business, its 401(k) division.  Betterment for Business, which uses algorithms to digitally manage participants’ retirement plans, has reportedly attracted around 300 mostly small businesses to its platform, as well as some high-profile start-ups like Casper, the online mattress company, and Boxed, a New York-based wholesaler.  In February, Betterment added Google’s director of global benefits John Casey to the board of Betterment for Business. Mares and McKinnon have both worked with Fortune 500 companies on investment and retirement plan management, and their presence on the board will likely help Betterment’s bid to be taken seriously as a big plan provider. Mares worked in the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration as the deputy assistant secretary for policy from 2013 to January 2017 helping to develop the fiduciary rule, which requires financial advisers to put their retirement clients interests first. Before joining the Labor Department, Mares served as the chief investment officer at General Mills, Ameritech and Alliant Techsystems.  McKinnon spent over 20 years at BlackRock, most recently helping big companies and states to analyze data about their retirement plans and participants to cut costs and increase investor returns. McKinnon said she thinks Betterment could be a good tool for companies to reduce “hard and soft costs” of plan management. “I think they can become a provider of choice in the institutional market,” McKinnon said.

1326,BLK,BlackRock to pay $1.25 billion over 20 years for New York headquarters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) will initially pay about $60 per square foot in rent for its future headquarters in the Hudson Yards district on the far west side of midtown Manhattan, the company said in a filing on Thursday. BlackRock, which oversees $5.4 trillion in assets and is the world’s largest asset manager, is moving into 847,000 square feet (78,690 sq meters) of a development that will be part of a neighborhood rising over rail yards and tracks in a once-forlorn corner of New York City. The company said in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it will pay $50.8 million per year in the first five years, and an increasing amount after that, for a total $1.25 billion over 20 years.  That works out to about $60 per square foot to start, and nearly $74 over the full term of the lease for the offices at 50 Hudson Yards. The company also will be responsible for its operating expenses at the building and a share of property taxes, which will add about $30 a square foot to the lease, a source with knowledge of the transaction said. The lease is one of the largest ever in Manhattan in terms of size and value of the overall contract. The average asking rent in April for midtown Manhattan office space was $84.09 a square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Along Park Avenue, near where BlackRock is currently located, asking rents averaged $91.13 a square foot. High-end “trophy” properties, such as 50 Hudson Yards, often rent at higher rates than average. The developing district has also attracted Coach Inc COH.N, Wells Fargo Securities and the National Hockey League. The success of the Hudson Yards district has already moved the center of Manhattan’s office complex from BlackRock’s current location, in the coveted Plaza District in midtown, south and westward to the new development. The BlackRock lease was agreed on Wednesday and starts May 1, 2023. For the time being, BlackRock has offices in two buildings on 52nd Street off Park Avenue, along with other locations. Its new building, which is expected to be finished in 2022 and be the city’s fourth-largest office tower, will include 15 floors of a 58-story tower developed by Related Cos LP and Oxford Properties Group Inc. It also includes a 400-seat auditorium. BlackRock received a $25 million tax credit from New York state as part of the move on the condition the company creates 700 new jobs and retains staffing in the city of about 2,700 for a decade.

Fink, who spoke at a conference in an interview by Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive John Cryan, said that businesses in the current quarter are not seeing the acceleration the markets are expecting. He also pointed to the flattening yield curve as a sign that bond markets reflect less optimism for economic growth than stocks do. A flattening yield curve refers to a decline in the premium investors demand for longer-dated U.S. government bonds over those maturing sooner.

That index remains below its long-term average. Fink said the stock rally since the election had at least been partly validated by strong first-quarter earnings growth as well as political stability in Europe after centrist victories in elections in the Netherlands and France.

1338,BLK,UPDATE 3-Exxon shareholders approve climate impact report in win for activists,"DALLAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp’s (XOM.N) chief executive said on Wednesday the company would reconsider how it communicates the risks its faces from climate change after shareholders approved a measure calling for increased transparency.  The non-binding proposal passed with 62 percent of ballots cast in a rare defeat for Exxon’s management, which had recommended a vote against the measure. The company argued that it already provides sufficient information on the potential impact of changing technologies and energy demand on its asset portfolio. The results likely reflected a shift in how big shareholders voted on the measure, as the same proposal last year received only 38.1 percent of shares voted.  Asset manager BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) backed the proposal, according to a source familiar with the matter. BlackRock holds about 6 percent of Exxon shares. Among other top Exxon shareholders, spokespeople for State Street Corp (STT.N) and Vanguard Group declined to comment on the vote on Wednesday. “It’s a powerful message,” New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in an interview. A New York state public employee pension fund he oversees was one of the proposal’s sponsors. “They recognized the global community is staying committed to Paris,” he said, referring to the Paris global climate accord.  The proposal asked for Exxon to report on risks its business could face from technology changes and from climate change policies such as the 2015 accord aiming to keep average global temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius.   In remarks following the shareholder meeting, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said the board would reconsider its climate change-related communications but did not commit to producing the report requested in the proposal.  He also said board directors would review a policy designed to bar them from meeting individually with big shareholders, a practice criticized by the climate proposal sponsors.  “We take the vote seriously will respond to that feedback and look for opportunities” to communicate, Woods said. “That issue along with others is part of dialogue we have with the board.”  Exxon still faces probes by Massachusetts and New York Attorneys General into whether it misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has said suits are politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change. Protesters, some in skeleton costumes, held up signs saying “Exxon Lied” across the street from Wednesday’s annual meeting. Approval of Exxon’s executive pay meanwhile received 68 percent of ballots cast, down from 89 percent a year ago. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended shareholders reject the executive pay plan. A proposal calling for a report on Exxon’s efforts to reduce emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas, in its operations received support of nearly 39 percent of ballots cast. Another proposal calling on the company to increase shareholder payouts in light of climate change-related risks was approved by less than 4 percent of ballots cast. Exxon had opposed both proposals.    Earlier, Exxon’s Woods had said the company supported the goals of many of the proposals, but disagreed with the methods.

1339,BLK,Exxon vote shows Wall St diverging from Trump on climate change,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Major investors put U.S. industry on notice on Wednesday that climate change matters, even as reports emerged that President Donald Trump plans to withdraw the United States from an international pact to fight global warming. A number of large institutional fund firms including BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, supported a shareholder resolution calling on Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to share more information about how new technologies and climate change regulations could impact the business of the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. The proposal won the support of 62.3 percent of votes cast. The victory, on such a wide margin, was hailed by climate activists as a turning point in their decades-long campaign to get oil and gas companies to communicate how they would adapt to a low-carbon economy. With major investors now seeing climate change as a major risk, activists said U.S. corporations will have to be more transparent about the impact of a warming planet even if the United States withdraws from the 2015 Paris climate accord, as Trump promised during his presidential campaign.  “Economic forces are outrunning any other considerations,” said Anne Simpson, investment director for sustainability at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, one of the sponsors of the resolution. She credited big investors in Exxon for the change, since at least some of them switched their votes after last year when a similar measure won just 38 percent support. “We have seen a sea change in their viewpoint,” she said. Many top investors now consider their votes on shareholder proposals “on merit, rather than considering it a test of loyalty to management,” she said. Among Exxon’s top investors, Vanguard Group Inc and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) opposed last year’s call for climate change reporting. A spokeswoman for Vanguard, which has about 7 percent of Exxon’s shares, declined to comment on its voting this year. A person familiar with the matter said funds run by BlackRock, which holds about 6 percent of Exxon shares, voted in favor of the climate resolution. Filings showing their exact votes are not due for months. But both fund firms and others have taken steps since last year to make it easier to support climate resolutions. A spokesman for Exxon’s ninth-largest investor Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O), Doug Holt, said it voted in favor of the proposal, citing its own guidelines updated in 2016. The investment firms’ approach reflects a new interest in climate matters among their own investors, who have stuffed  money into so-called “green” mutual funds and other vehicles that use environmental factors in their stockpicking. Wall Street’s priorities have shifted the terms of debate at a number of other energy and utility companies. A majority of shareholders voting at Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) and PPL Corp (PPL.N) called for similar reports on the risks of climate change. Votes on two more of the measures are scheduled for June 7 at Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) and at Hess Corp (HES.N).  Michael Crosby, involved in corporate outreach for the Midwest Capuchin Franciscans, a religious order, said Wednesday’s vote was a rejection of Exxon’s arguments it already provides enough detail on its outlook.  “The Street is saying, you have to give better evidence,” Crosby said. After the measure passed, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said its board would reconsider its climate communications.  The activists now face the task of maintaining alliances with leaders like Woods who opposed their resolutions but who in some cases support the 195-nation Paris agreement. Exxon said in a March 22 letter to the White House that the Paris deal is “an effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change.” Trump had at least one ally at Exxon’s meeting in Dallas, Steven Milloy of Potomac, Maryland, who urged other investors to support his resolution that would make it harder to file proposals like the one on climate change. Milloy said management should show less concerns for climate issues, which he called misplaced, and cited Trump as a model. “For the first time we have a president who actively opposes climate hysteria,” Milloy said. According to Exxon, Milloy’s proposal received support from 1.6 percent of votes cast.

1340,BLK,RPT-Exxon vote shows Wall St diverging from Trump on climate change,"(Repeats story published Wednesday with no changes) By Ross Kerber BOSTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Major investors put U.S. industry on notice on Wednesday that climate change matters, even as reports emerged that President Donald Trump plans to withdraw the United States from an international pact to fight global warming. A number of large institutional fund firms including BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, supported a shareholder resolution calling on Exxon Mobil Corp to share more information about how new technologies and climate change regulations could impact the business of the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. The proposal won the support of 62.3 percent of votes cast. The victory, on such a wide margin, was hailed by climate activists as a turning point in their decades-long campaign to get oil and gas companies to communicate how they would adapt to a low-carbon economy. With major investors now seeing climate change as a major risk, activists said U.S. corporations will have to be more transparent about the impact of a warming planet even if the United States withdraws from the 2015 Paris climate accord, as Trump promised during his presidential campaign. “Economic forces are outrunning any other considerations,” said Anne Simpson, investment director for sustainability at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, one of the sponsors of the resolution.

1347,BLK,One of BlackRock's longest-serving mutual fund managers to retire -memo,"NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - One of BlackRock Inc’s longest-serving mutual fund managers, who is responsible for tens of billions of dollars in investors’ money, is stepping down. Dennis Stattman, who has run what is now BlackRock’s largest mutual fund for more than 28 years, will retire from his role at the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund  in August, according to an internal memo on Tuesday. The fund currently has $40 billion in assets under management. Stattman, who turns 66 this month, is “confident that the time is right to complete a carefully planned process of transitioning management of Global Allocation to the team he built,” according to the memo signed by two top BlackRock executives, Rob Kapito and Rich Kushel. A BlackRock spokesman said Stattman was not available to comment. The retirement is the latest sign of a changing order at BlackRock, a bellwether for an industry challenged by investors’ flight to lower-cost products. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock also offers relatively low-fee index funds through its iShares brand. The New York-based company has also been handing over more responsibilities from its traditionalist stockpickers to its data-crunching quantitative investors in a bid to boost performance. In March, the company announced a formal restructuring that cut fees and some portfolio managers. Merrill Lynch & Co started the Global Allocation Fund in 1989 as the market was still clawing back from losses in the 1987 Black Monday market crash. Merrill sold that investment management business to BlackRock, then a much smaller company, in 2006. The fund is a “multi-asset” portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments, pitched as offering strong returns and protection from market swings. Relatively low-cost institutional shares of the fund have returned nearly 10 percent a year since the fund started 28 years ago, beating most of its few surviving rivals. During the financial crisis in 2008, the fund beat most its peers and managed to take in new cash from investors. Yet Global Allocation has recorded about $25 billion in withdrawals since 2012, according to Thomson Reuters’ Lipper research unit. The fund’s other four portfolio managers - Dan Chamby, Russ Koesterich, David Clayton and Kent Hogshire - will all continue in their roles. Chamby is a veteran at the fund’s helm, while Koesterich, Clayton and Hogshire were elevated to portfolio manager roles earlier this year. They will continue to manage a sprawling team of more than 50 people who focus on the fund, including analysts, traders and marketing personnel. Stattman will continue as an adviser to the asset manager’s Multi-Asset Strategies Group, which oversees the fund, according to the memo.

1349,BLK,"BlackRock takes Scalable Capital stake in Europe ""robo-advisor"" push","LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N), the world’s biggest asset manager, made its first push into Europe’s “robo-advice” market on Tuesday after taking a stake in Anglo-German digital investment manager Scalable Capital. BlackRock, which manages $5.4 trillion across a range of actively managed and index-tracking funds, led a 30 million euro ($33.6 million) funding round for Scalable alongside its two existing German venture capital backers, a joint statement said. The funding will help Scalable expand its robo-advice business - which uses low-cost exchange-based funds and online distribution - with financial institutions and corporates to help grow assets past the 250 million euros raised in the 16 months since launch from more than 6,000 retail clients. The expansion of BlackRock’s digital efforts comes as fund and wealth managers globally look to overhaul their distribution models amid tougher regulation, pressure on fees and the changing investment needs of a younger generation. Patrick Olson, BlackRock’s chief operating officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and who will join Scalable’s supervisory board, said the decision to invest came as investors increasingly wanted to access their holdings using technology. “This trend is prompting strong demand from European financial institutions – including banks, insurers, wealth managers and advisory firms – for high-quality technology-enabled investment solutions,” Olsen said. Scalable Capital, founded in 2014 and based in Munich and London, uses exchange-traded funds from BlackRock and others to build low-cost portfolios for clients and is actively looking to expand into other European countries. As well as Britain and Germany, it is also active in Austria. New European rules aimed at improving transparency, value for money and protections for investors meant traditional asset and wealth managers would need to use technology to help design, manage and distribute investments, the companies said. “Technology is not just a competitive advantage but a requirement for wealth management businesses to be successful in the future,” Adam French, co-founder and co-CEO at Scalable Capital, said. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the third quarter. The companies declined to specify the size of the equity stake taken by BlackRock or its growth targets. The deal for Scalable comes several months after BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters he was considering up to four small acquisitions to shore up its technology and investment expertise. It also follows the purchase in 2015 of U.S.-based robo-adviser FutureAdvisor which, like Scalable, uses exchange-traded funds to build portfolios for clients and began serving retail customers. Since then, FutureAdvisor has put more emphasis on licensing its service to big wealth management companies to offer through their own advisers, typically to lower-tier clients who they might otherwise not retain. BlackRock is keen to win more market share with those wealth management firms, which are already a primary distributor of its funds to the general public. FutureAdvisor disclosed having $969 million in assets under management and 13,751 accounts in a February filing with U.S. regulators, up from $232 million and 3,460 accounts around when the BlackRock deal was announced in 2015. As well as FutureAdvisor, BlackRock’s digital wealth management business includes Aladdin Risk for Wealth, iRetire and iCapital, all of which are solely for U.S.-based clients. Fink has placed an unusual emphasis on technology for a company in his industry, including through the company’s Aladdin operating system for investment management, which it licenses to rivals. It is also exploring how computer models can improve stock picking while reducing costs and in March announced plans to bolster an internal team known for data-driven approaches to picking stocks.

1355,BLK,Low U.S. inflation? It's your phone: BlackRock bond manager,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans’ love of their smartphones and apps may be contributing to the sluggish pace of inflation that is worrying  Wall Street and the Federal Reserve, a top bond manager at BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, said on Wednesday. Consumers are relying less and less on devices such as cameras, radios and televisions, and services such as taxis and stores, replacing them with programs in their iPhones and other high-end phones, according to Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income. Companies like Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] have enticed consumers with convenience and low prices through their phones. As a result, they have upended traditional retailers, entertainment outlets and transportation services, Rieder said in an article published on Wednesday. “Technological innovation is disrupting traditional business models of many industries, putting a lid on prices and influencing inflation in the economy overall,” he wrote. The core rate of the consumer price index, the U.S. government’s broadest inflation gauge, increased 1.7 percent year-on-year in May, the smallest such rise since May 2015, the Labor Department said last week. On Monday, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans, when asked about Amazon’s proposed $13.7 billion buyout of up-market grocer Whole Foods Market Inc at an event in New York, said new competitors with a technological edge entering in major industries pose possible long-term implications that inflation will remain low. Some of the recent pullback in inflation also stemmed from lower energy prices resulting from global oversupply, analysts said. The recent softening of inflation has raised speculation on the timing on the U.S. central bank’s next rate increase. A few policymakers including Evans have said it may be worthwhile for the Fed to wait until year-end before considering another rate hike. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker told the Financial Times the Fed should defer its next hike until December. In the meantime, this technological shift will likely persist, Rieder said, making it difficult for inflation to meet the Fed’s 2 percent target,  which policymakers deem optimal to support stable economic growth. “This is an increasingly challenging paradigm to execute upon today in the more modern commerce era we live in,” Rieder said. “We believe both investors and policymakers need to abandon an overly rigid view of price change.” ",6212017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-inflation-technology-blackrock/low-u-s-inflation-its-your-phone-blackrock-bond-manager-idUSKBN19C264

Terms were not disclosed. Cachematrix builds a software tool that banks can provide to corporate treasurers managing the cash and short-term debt they hold. Investments can be made in money-market funds provided by BlackRock and rival money managers, such as Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Just last week, BlackRock said it would take a stake in Scalable Capital, a European digital investment manager. The deals come two months after BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters he was considering up to four small acquisitions to shore up the New York-based company’s technology and investment expertise. Fink has placed an unusual emphasis on technology for a company in his industry, including through the company’s Aladdin operating system for investment management, which it licenses to rivals. The latest deal gives BlackRock a new stable of bank clients and pushes Aladdin further into the business of advising companies on how to invest their cash. In a statement, BlackRock said it plans to combine some of Cachematrix’s features with Aladdin. On its website, Cachematrix lists Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and HSBC (HSBA.L) among its clients and reports assisting with $200 billion of client assets. Banks trying to meet strict requirements intended to prevent another financial crisis have been looking to shed deposits that would require them to hold more capital. Businesses have been eager to find places to put cash as ultra-easy monetary policy has pushed yields on debt to historic lows. BlackRock in 2015 expanded its reach in the business of managing large institutions’ cash and short-term investments when it acquired the money-market fund business run by Bank of America. BlackRock’s cash business included nearly $400 billion in assets at the end of March.

1360,BLK,BlackRock moves 50 ETFs to NYSE's rival exchanges,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) on Friday said it would move fifty of its exchange-traded funds from NYSE Arca to homes on rival trading exchanges in a move that points to more competition in the fast-growing industry. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of ETFs will move 30 of its iShares-brand ETFs to CBOE Holdings Inc’s (CBOE.O) Bats exchange and an additional 20 ETFs to Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O), the New York-based company said in a statement. BlackRock managed $1.4 trillion in ETFs on March 31. Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s (ICE.N) NYSE Arca exchange is home to the lion’s share of the more than 2,000 U.S.-listed ETFs, but competitors have been aggressively trying to win away issuers and traders. After the changes are made on Aug 1, iShares will still have 209 ETFs listed on NYSE Arca, the company said. NYSE has faced scrutiny for technical glitches affecting ETFs, including a March issue that prevented some ETFs from completing an auction at the end of the day. In a statement, Samara Cohen, Americas Head of iShares Capital Markets at BlackRock, said “a thriving market for ETFs requires a robust, resilient ecosystem, with multiple participants committed to continuous innovation and improving the client experience.” A NYSE spokeswoman declined to comment.

1363,BLK,Two top 'quant' researchers exit BlackRock as it revamps stock unit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two high-level quantitative researchers have left BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) as the world’s largest asset manager embarks on an ambitious effort to engineer a high-tech revolution within its stockpicking business. Michael Lemmon, a former University of Utah finance professor and a senior researcher within BlackRock’s quantitative Scientific Active Equity unit, left for Citadel LLC, a spokeswoman for Ken Griffin’s hedge fund confirmed. Paddy McCrudden, a former Australia-based portfolio manager and mathematician who was most recently a senior strategist for BlackRock’s quant unit in New York, also left the company, BlackRock confirmed. Both former employees hold PhDs and were managing directors at BlackRock. Both declined to comment. A BlackRock spokeswoman confirmed the departures but declined to comment further. In March, BlackRock announced a major overhaul of its actively managed equities business, cutting jobs, dropping fees and relying more on computers to help pick stocks. The move handed over more assets and prominence to BlackRock’s high-performing Scientific Active Equity group, based primarily in San Francisco, that uses rigorous quantitative analysis of data to generate investment ideas. The project also dramatically increases the budget for a team focused on data analysis. The strategy, internally code-named “Monarch,” is designed to jumpstart BlackRock’s stock funds business, which has delivered mixed performance overall. Over five years, 90 percent of assets run by the Scientific team were beating their benchmark, according to data BlackRock reported to shareholders at the end of March. That compares to 49 percent of assets run by BlackRock’s traditionalist “Fundamental” team. BlackRock will update those figures on July 17 when it reports second-quarter earnings. The asset management business is being reordered by a move from funds in which managers pick promising individual stocks to lower-cost index funds that own the entire market. Lemmon co-authored a “Financial Analysts Journal” article last year that argued that asset managers that charge high fees and struggle to justify their value face “extinction” as they compete both with fairly simple quant portfolios and highly sophisticated investors. BlackRock is a major provider of index funds through its iShares business and has seen its stock market value swell to record levels even as many of its competitors languish. BlackRock managed $5.4 trillion on March 31, with $286 billion in active equities. In all, actively managed funds represent nearly a third of BlackRock’s assets but an outsized near-50 percent of its fees.

1368,BLK,No systemic risk from cryptocurrency speculation: BlackRock strategist,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) global chief investment strategist on Tuesday suggested that loose monetary policy may have aided speculation in digital currencies like bitcoin, but he said the risk to the broader financial system appears limited. The strategist, Richard Turnill, said it might be possible to view price movements in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies as influenced by the ultra-easy monetary policies put in place by central banks after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. But sharp price gains in cryptocurrencies may be a sign of excess and have led some investors to call the market a bubble. “I look at the charts, and to me that looks pretty scary,” Turnill said at a media briefing in New York. Turnill and his colleagues have been advising clients to stay invested in global stocks even as some other strategists warn that prices are overextended after a run-up over the better part of the last decade. Bitcoin, the primary cryptocurrency, hit a record just shy of $3,000 last month but has fallen some 20 percent since then, trading at $2,366 on Tuesday. Over the last year, bitcoin is still up 264 percent. Competing cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and litecoin, posted quadruple-digit percentage gains ahead of losses in recent days. The virtual currency relies on “mining” computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. The first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins. Some investors have warmed to the technology, wooed by its explosive performance and the potential that the currency compete with gold and government-issued money as a store of value. Some also see other potential uses for blockchain, the technology that documents and verifies bitcoin transactions. But Turnill suggested the broader financial risks associated with blockchain-based currencies appear limited. “There’s no evidence that if that price went to zero tomorrow that there’d be any broader financial implication over time, but to me it is example of where you’re getting some big price movements in the market.” ",7112017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-bitcoin-outlook/no-systemic-risk-from-cryptocurrency-speculation-blackrock-strategist-idUSKBN19W2BE
1369,BLK,BlackRock takes options to calm Brexit nerves despite pound positivity,"LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is taking some exposure to the pound through options markets for fear of what months of messy Brexit talks may bring, although it maintains the currency is fairly valued.

1371,BLK,"BlackRock cuts fees, builds bond indexes in bid 'to be ubiquitous'","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock Inc on Thursday launched four bond exchange-traded funds and cut fees on another in an effort to lure more investors to its products from traditional debt markets. The moves come as BlackRock estimates bond ETFs attracted $84 billion so far in 2017, a record for the first-half of the year, and the company establishes a new business line building its own indexes. “We have aspirations to be ubiquitous in every securities market,” said Martin Small, U.S. Head of iShares at BlackRock, in an interview with Reuters. In a first for the company, iShares Edge Investment Grade Enhanced Bond ETF and iShares Edge High Yield Defensive Bond ETF will track indexes BlackRock built. ETFs are a basket of stocks, bonds or other assets. They often track an index, rather than trying to beat the market. More fund providers are designing their own indexes to outperform the market. HYDB is a high-yield fund but is designed to avoid bonds most likely to go bust. IGEB attempts to pay higher yields than the broader high-grade bond market. Stock and bondpicking managers have also been building new ETFs to recoup business they are losing to plain-vanilla index funds. By building its own indexes BlackRock can retain fees it would pay an index provider, such as Bloomberg LP, Markit Group Ltd or JPMorgan Chase & Co. “Brand names on indexes matter less and less every year,” said Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com. BlackRock is cutting prices on the $10 billion iShares MBS ETF to $9 a year for every $10,000 an investor holds, from $27. The price cut could cost BlackRock $18.3 million in annual revenue, Reuters estimates. Small said the markdown allows BlackRock to capture business from asset managers, insurers, corporations, sovereign wealth funds and central banks who would otherwise trade individual mortgage securities. The U.S. Federal Reserve could start trimming its $4.5 trillion in debt holdings this year, sparking more transactions as debt prices fall. ETF shares trade on exchanges, like stocks, and can be easier to buy than bonds sold “over the counter” by a dealer. The iShares MBS fund still charges higher fees than the Vanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF, at $7 a year per $10,000 managed. Small said the iShares fund leads its market and does not compete with other ETFs.

1373,BLK,BlackRock supports effort to boost number of women board members,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) voted for eight proposals pushing U.S. and Canadian companies to adopt policies boosting their boards’ diversity during the most recent quarter, the world’s largest asset manager said on Thursday. BlackRock said it supported the shareholder motions to press companies to develop or disclose policies geared to promote gender diversity. It did not name the companies it pushed but said the “majority” had boards of directors lacking women. “We’ve been particularly focused on increasing the number of women on U.S. boards because progress in the U.S. has been slower than in many other markets,” BlackRock said in a report it distributed. “Board diversity, particularly in terms of gender, is important from a sustainable investment perspective, given that diverse groups have been demonstrated to make better decisions,” it added. “This appears to be because they are better able to consider, where appropriate, alternatives to current strategies - a proposition that can ultimately lead to sustained value creation.” Women hold about a fifth of board seats in the S&P; 500 .SPX index, according to Catalyst Inc, an advocacy group. BlackRock said it also voted against board members at five companies who sat on nominating committees but failed to respond to investors’ concerns about diversity. It was the first year the company “decided to vote against members of the nomination committee of men-only boards in a more systematic manner,” a spokesman said, although it had engaged on the topic of gender diversity for “many years.”  The New York-based company manages more than $5.4 trillion in assets, many in index funds that buy broad swaths of the market, making it a top shareholder in most public companies. It has been pressured by activists and investors to back shareholder-fronted propositions and vote against obstinate boards to prompt better corporate citizenship. Chief Executive Larry Fink has encouraged executives to adjust their behavior to focus on generating long-term value for shareholders, rather than meeting short-term earnings targets.

In an interview tied to BlackRock’s second-quarter earnings, Fink told Reuters that U.S. growth rates would likely be around 2 percent to 2.5 percent, echoing comments last week by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Meanwhile, economic prospects elsewhere in the world are on the upswing. “The world feels very good,” Fink told Reuters from Copenhagen, where his company’s board is meeting, citing economic performance in Europe, China, Japan and Canada. “There’s still some dark clouds in the United States.” JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon on Friday lashed out against political gridlock in Washington and how it is stalling growth, saying it is “almost an embarrassment being an American citizen traveling around the world.” But Fink remains bullish on the United States, saying “we have the greatest companies in the world” and that he was “very encouraged” by the Fed’s policies. Fink is among several executives whose advice Trump has sought since taking office through a business advisory council. New York-based BlackRock’s assets under management jumped 16 percent to nearly $5.7 trillion, but revenue gained just 6 percent to $2.97 billion and earnings per share rose 10 percent to $5.22, or $5.24 after adjusting for non-recurring items and other charges. That performance fell short of Wall Street analysts’ earnings per share and revenue targets, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1385,BLK,Novo Banco launches debt swap to conclude sale,"LISBON, July 25 (Reuters) - Portugal’s state-rescued Novo Banco has launched a debt swap to boost its capital ratio, the last step to concluding its sale to U.S. private equity firm Lone Star. The bank said in a statement that it aims to raise 500 million euros ($583 million) from the swap and would offer to buy 36 bond issues at “market prices” in a process that would run from Tuesday until Oct. 2. The operation is a condition of the sale of 75 percent of Novo Banco to Lone Star, which was agreed in March. The government has said it hopes to conclude the sale by November. Novo Banco was carved out of Portugal’s biggest ever bank collapse in 2014 after a 4.9 billion euro rescue operation of Banco Espirito Santo. A group of bondholders led by U.S. fund BlackRock have sought an injunction to block the sale of Novo Banco, fearing it would damage their claim to be compensated for an estimated 1.5 billion euros in losses suffered on Novo Banco bonds.

1387,BLK,Deutsche Bank asset management listing seen in H1 2018 at earliest - sources,"FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank’s planned listing of its asset management arm is unlikely before the first half of next year and could be later, as it wants more time to refine and sell the business’s strategy to potential investors, people close to the matter said. Germany’s largest lender announced plans to list the unit, including its main DWS retail asset management brand, in March as part of a broader restructuring aimed at reviving the bank’s fortunes following costly lawsuits and trading scandals. While it said at the time the share sale would take place at some point over the next two years, investors expected the bank to move quickly to take advantage of buoyant equity markets and seal a deal that could raise 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion). But its so-called “equity story” for selling the business to investors is far from ready, and Deutsche is desperate to avoid another U-turn after it put retail business Postbank up for sale, only to decide later to keep it, the sources said. Some investors have also indicated they would prefer a stronger focus at Deutsche’s asset management arm on so-called passive investments or exchange traded funds (ETFs), whereas its main business is currently with actively managed funds. “The IPO story is not ready yet,” one of the people said, adding that in his view the unit needed to invest in its ETF business to keep up with competitors. A spokesperson for Deutsche said: “We are currently focused on creating a Deutsche AM business that is distinct from Deutsche Bank, in preparation for the planned partial IPO. We expect to complete that process later this year. We have not yet started to present our equity story to investors.” Deutsche Bank reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday. Chief Executive John Cryan conceded in May it would take time to realise the benefits of the lender’s latest efforts to “plant and sow” - or breathe new life into the Deutsche brand. ETFs Deutsche Asset Management currently has 723 billion euros invested worldwide, of which 540 billion are actively managed, 103 billion in ETFs and the rest in alternatives such as real estate. Concern around the scale of Deutsche’s ETF offering comes as market leaders BlackRock and Vanguard continue to grow assets under management in Europe, with the latter flagging plans to expand its continental operations. Underpinning that is a belief the market for ETFs in Europe will continue to grow strongly over the coming years, fuelled in part by new regulations aimed at making the costs of investing more transparent. European ETF assets rose for the fifth straight year to hit a record 514.5 billion euros in 2016, data from Thomson Reuters Lipper show, up 15 percent but still just a fraction of the 9.4 trillion euros in total invested assets. But with asset managers under pressure from investors to cut fees, even in the already low-cost ETF market, a provider needs to have scale to succeed. European sales of ETFs during 2016 were led by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, the Lipper data show, with Deutsche Bank not even making the top-10. It still retained its position as the second-biggest ETF provider in Europe, behind BlackRock’s iShares, with assets under management of 53.3 billion euros, the data show. But by May, Deutsche's ETF brand Xtrackers had fallen to third place behind BlackRock and Societe Generale's Lyxor unit.

In its letter last month to investors, Third Point called BlackRock an “asset-gathering machine,” with organic net inflows of over 70 percent annualized. “Yet we see BlackRock as far more than an asset manager dependent on market movements. It is increasingly becoming a network or index-like business, with earnings power driven by ETFs (via iShares) and data & analytic services (via Aladdin),” Third Point said.  “These are oligopoly businesses with faster growth and much higher incremental margins than traditional asset management - and thus deserve much higher P/E multiples over time.”  Third Point, which earned 4.6 percent in its Offshore Fund during the second quarter, bringing total returns for the year to 10.7 percent, also reinitiated an investment in Alibaba.

In its second quarter letter, Third Point said Alibaba has consistently surpassed its growth estimates for gross merchandise value, revenue, and earnings and currently, the company has achieved scale. “Alibaba is currently at a positive inflection point after rolling out significant changes over the past year to its advertising platform, which currently generates the majority of the company’s revenue,” Third Point said. “We view these changes as an important catalyst for meaningful revenue acceleration over the next few years. Combined with an attractive multiple, we believe now is the time to own Alibaba again.” During the second quarter, Third Point also dissolved its share stake in Snap Inc (SNAP.N), Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).

Mark McCombe, who has already taken over managing people who used to report directly to Chief Executive Larry Fink and President Rob Kapito, is dropping his role as head of BlackRock’s alternative investing business line to focus exclusively on leading the Americas region, according to the memo, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Replacing McCombe as head of the BlackRock Alternative Investors division is David Blumer, a former Credit Suisse Group AG veteran who joined BlackRock about four years ago and most recently headed the company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, the memo said. Rachel Lord is taking over that region, according to the memo, bringing a senior executive whose primary focus has been iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into a more prominent role in that market. Stephen Cohen, who has focused on the rapidly growing bond ETF business, is assuming the role as head of EMEA iShares, according to the memo. The moves bring fresh blood into the top leadership ranks at BlackRock. One of BlackRock’s founders in 1988, Fink has not publicly named a successor, but McCombe is among a small group tipped as possibilities, including Kapito, Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein and Mark Wiedman, the global head of iShares. BlackRock has $5.7 trillion in assets under management. Index-tracking ETFs, once considered an industry backwater, are now responsible for the lion’s share of the billions in cash BlackRock pulls in annually and a source of consternation to traditionalist stock pickers who typically charge higher fees. Earlier this year, BlackRock overhauled its actively managed equities business, cutting jobs, dropping fees and relying more on computers to pick stocks. Alternatives, meanwhile, range from hedge funds to real estate and infrastructure projects like wind and solar farms. The unit represents 2 percent of BlackRock’s assets but an outsized 6 percent of fees. Fink has made growing that business a priority, and the unit has attracted cash this year. But the space has grown increasingly competitive as institutional clients balk at locking up money and paying high fees for results that can be lackluster.

He joined as chairman of BlackRock’s smallest global region, Asia Pacific and is based now in San Francisco, where many of the company’s data-driven quantitative investors involved in the stock-picking overhaul are based. “We regularly review, with the Board, leadership and succession planning for all of our businesses and seek to ensure we are developing leaders with broad experience across the entire firm,” Fink and Kapito said in the note.

1412,BLK,Largest U.S. university endowment funds pull back on ETF exposure,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The largest U.S. college endowment funds are pulling back their holdings of exchange-traded funds even as they invest more money in passive strategies overall, a move that may help bolster traditional mutual fund managers at a time when ETF providers like BlackRock Inc are seeing the majority of investor inflows.  The 10 largest higher education endowment funds in the United States now have an average of 14.4 percent of their direct equity portfolios in ETFs, a 15 percent decline from this time two years ago, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These filings do not reflect an endowment fund’s assets invested in traditional mutual funds, private equity or hedge funds, which together make up the bulk of their portfolios. In most cases, university endowments that are pulling back on ETFs in their direct portfolios are replacing them with increased holdings of individual shares.  The $10.4 billion University of Notre Dame endowment fund, for instance, reduced its holdings of ETFs from 57 percent of its direct equity portfolio to 2.1 percent over the last two years, SEC filings show. Its largest holdings now include Chinese e-commerce company JD.com Inc, Ally Financial Inc and Charter Communications Inc.  The university declined to comment for this story.  Other large endowment funds that significantly cut back their ETF exposure include the $40 billion University of Texas system and $7 billion Emory University, filings show.  Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at New York-based CFRA, said that endowment fund managers are often more comfortable with traditional mutual funds because they do not need the flexibility to trade throughout the day that ETFs provide. In response, BlackRock has been launching mutual fund versions of its popular factor-based ETFs in order to appeal to larger institutional investors, he said.  With U.S. stocks near record highs, portfolio managers may add more value by selecting the shares of individual companies rather than buying a broad ETF. The benchmark S&P; 500 is up 11.5 percent for the year to date and trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 22.1, well above the roughly 18 multiple that it traded at three years ago.  Overall, endowment funds get 30 percent of their U.S. equity exposure through passive strategies, nearly double the rate of three years ago, according to a study of more than 800 schools by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.

1415,BLK,BlackRock CEO Fink says he is committed to gender diversity,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Larry Fink on Wednesday said the largest asset manager must mirror its customers in terms of gender, comments that come as the company has become more vocal about shareholder and activist efforts to boost workplace diversity. “The reality is in the world more than 50 percent of household wealth is managed by women,” said Fink, who spoke at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York.  “And so if I’m going to be a mirror of my clients, we are going to need more women in our firm.” BlackRock said this year that 39 percent of its employees are women, and that 43 percent of its total hires in 2016 and 29 percent of those brought on in senior leadership positions last year are women.

1416,BLK,ECB to wind down stimulus starting early 2018: BlackRock's Rieder,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc portfolio manager Rick Rieder said on Wednesday that investors should look for the European Central Bank to withdraw some of its stimulus beginning early next year. “We think at the next meeting they will announce a taper,” or a wind-down in the ECB bond-buying program, said Rieder, global chief investment officer of fixed income at the world’s largest asset management company, which oversees $5.7 trillion in assets. “That is the next thing to keep an eye on.” Such an announcement would come at the same time as a historic shift by central bankers in the United States to unwind bond-buying quantitative easing programs they put in place to stimulate the economy after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The Fed said on Wednesday it would begin in October to reduce its approximately $4.2 trillion in holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. “It’s the right thing, and it’s historic,” said Rieder. Rieder said interest rates are too low in the developed world and that the European economy could “absolutely withstand” tighter monetary policy, including somewhat higher rates. Yet ECB policymakers disagree on whether to set a definitive end-date for their money-printing program when they meet in October, raising the chance that they will keep open at least the option of prolonging it again, six sources told Reuters this month. Rieder, who manages several portfolios at BlackRock, said he has been offloading longer-term government debt in developed markets in recent weeks but also buying agency-backed mortgage-backed securities, which he sees as reasonably priced “relative to other high-quality assets.” ",9202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-ecb-outlook/ecb-to-wind-down-stimulus-starting-early-2018-blackrocks-rieder-idUSKCN1BV2T7

1420,BLK,"Climate investment incubator branches out into cloud forests, cattle ranches","TEPIC, Mexico (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Latin American cloud forests, energy-saving street lights in Rio de Janeiro and sustainable cattle ranching in the Amazon will get a boost from new financial instruments to channel capital for tackling climate change, their backers said.  The Lab, a network of programs that incubates sustainable finance mechanisms, expects to attract an initial $855 million to six investment vehicles launched in New York on Wednesday, and is hoping to pull more private capital into its projects. Barbara Buchner, a climate finance expert who directs The Lab, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation mainstream investors have shown growing interest in climate change projects in the past couple of years. “The next challenge is to get them beyond the markets they’re now comfortable with,” she added, citing potential in land use, agriculture and adapting to climate change impacts. The Lab, set up in 2014, raised $822 million for its earlier initiatives, with around half coming from private investors.  It works with governments, philanthropic foundations, development banks and private-sector investors, including asset manager BlackRock Inc and Deutsche Bank.  The latest set of projects were required to address climate issues in an innovative way, be commercially viable, and not hamstrung by regulatory hurdles, said Buchner.  The instruments to be rolled out by The Lab include the Cloud Forest Blue Energy Mechanism, which aims to restore 60 million hectares of Latin American cloud forest through a scheme that would improve water security and hydropower profits while helping suck carbon from the atmosphere. And a private equity fund aims to be the first to invest in climate change adaptation technologies for developing countries. In Brazil, which has suffered a funding shortfall for green action, the Climate Smart Cattle Ranching scheme is seeking to raise $200 million for projects designed to restore damaged grazing land and reduce deforestation in the Amazon, targeting more than 300,000 hectares in the first five years.  Also in Brazil, the Green Receivables Fund (Green FIDC) will provide lower-cost capital to renewable and energy-efficient projects, including a street-lighting scheme in Rio de Janeiro.  Another Brazilian fund plans to cut agricultural energy costs by up to 20 percent by boosting off-grid renewable power. “Finance is critical to implementing Brazil’s goals to increase renewable energy (and) energy efficiency, and move toward sustainable land use,” said José Antônio Marcondes de Carvalho, a top environment official with Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The new Lab instruments will help Brazil achieve its climate change and sustainable development goals, he added. Buchner said The Lab was moving beyond a focus on initiatives that directly cut planet-warming emissions.  “There are some really good projects in other areas that can help address some of the sectors where we really need to scale up,” if the world is to meet its target to keep global warming within 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, she said.

1423,BLK,UPDATE 2-CapitaLand Commercial to buy Singapore office tower from BlackRock for $1.55 bln,"* CCT to buy 46-storey Asia Square Tower 2 * Building has net lettable area of 778,719 sq ft * Deal comes amid improving outlook for Singapore office rents * CCT to fund deal via rights issue, bank borrowings, divestment (Adds comment from JLL, other recent deals ) SINGAPORE, Sept 21 (Reuters) - CapitaLand Commercial Trust (CCT) said on Thursday it would buy a 46-storey office tower in Singapore’s financial district for S$2.1 billion ($1.55 billion) from BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager. The deal for Asia Square Tower 2 marks Singapore's second-largest office building sale after that of 43-storey Tower 1, which BlackRock sold last year to the Qatar Investment Authority for $2.5 billion. (reut.rs/2fkbeBb) CCT will buy Tower 2, whose tenants include National Australia Bank and Vodafone, for S$2,689 per square foot. The acquisition excludes the Westin hotel, which is located in the building. “Buildings of this quality and prominence are hard to come by, but we expect to see increased interest in Grade A office assets in Singapore off the back of this deal,” Stuart Crow, head of Asia Pacific capital markets at consultancy JLL, said in a statement. The building has a combined net lettable area of 778,719 square feet, while the larger Tower 1 had over 1.25 million square feet. “(The deal) provides another pricing benchmark which reconfirms that the recovery in office rents and prices is well underway,” said Jeremy Lake, executive director, capital markets at the CBRE real estate services firm. CBRE and JLL advised BlackRock. He said CBRE has been receiving increasing enquiries over the last few months from local and overseas investors about office opportunities in Singapore. A deal for the 28-storey PwC Building in Singapore’s financial district and a stake sale in TripleOne Somerset near the Orchard Road shopping belt mark some of the other recent commercial transactions. CCT said it will fund the acquisition through a combination of a rights issue to raise gross proceeds of S$700 million, external bank borrowings and proceeds from divestment of some properties. “Market statistics have shown that Singapore’s office market rents have reached a trough; hence, the acquisition will position CCT to benefit from the expected market uptick in Grade A office rents,” Lynette Leong, CCT’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. Real estate services firm Cushman and Wakefield said in a June report that, overall, Grade A central business district rents rose 1.7 percent in the second quarter, the first increase in nine quarters. It forecast a full-year rental increase of up to 5 percent for the overall Grade A market in the central business district. Trading in units of CCT, Singapore’s largest commercial real estate investment trust by market capitalisation, were halted on Thursday ahead of the news.

1425,BLK,BlackRock fees in limbo over donation to U.S. presidential candidate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A senior BlackRock Inc executive made a donation to an unsuccessful U.S. presidential candidate last year, an action that may prohibit the world’s largest asset manager from collecting some fees from a state government, a company regulatory filing showed. Mark Wiedman, a BlackRock senior managing director, donated $2,700 to the presidential campaign of Ohio Governor John Kasich, who was seeking the Republican Party nomination, according to a filing made earlier this year with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and reviewed by Reuters on Monday. Federal securities rules prohibit companies or their executive officers from making donations to government officials who could influence the hiring of a fund manager or have authority to appoint a person who could do so and then providing asset management services to their governments for a fee. The ban is in effect for two years after the contribution is made.  The state of Ohio uses BlackRock-managed funds, and its relationship with BlackRock “substantially predates” the donation, the filing said. In the May filing, BlackRock asked the SEC for permission to accept fees from the state of Ohio, saying that exceptions to the rule have been granted before. Without such a ruling, BlackRock said it could face a loss of approximately $37 million. BlackRock said Wiedman asked for and received a refund of his campaign contribution to Kasich, which was “made because of the personal political beliefs of the contributor and not because of any desire to influence the award of investment advisory business.” The SEC has not yet responded to BlackRock’s request. In an emailed statement, BlackRock said its application is “fair and reasonable, and consistent with the intent of the relevant rule.” “The contribution in question was made solely in support of Mr. Kasich’s presidential campaign and for no other purpose,” BlackRock spokeswoman Tara McDonnell said in the statement. “Through BlackRock’s robust policies and procedures, we discovered the contribution in question, and both BlackRock and Mr. Wiedman worked together to promptly address the error, including obtaining a refund of the $2,700 contribution,” McDonnell said. A spokesman for the SEC, Ryan White, declined to comment on the filing. A spokesman for Kasich did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the donation. Wiedman is global head of iShares and index investments, a booming business within BlackRock that includes its exchange-traded funds.

1427,BLK,BlackRock bond strategist sees potential for dollar rebound in 2017,"Sept 26 (Reuters) - The dollar could be headed for a rebound this year after a decline that has left it near its lowest level in more than two years, BlackRock’s chief fixed-income strategist said on Tuesday. Jeffrey Rosenberg said he views a resurgent dollar as a possibility in light of recent political developments in Europe putting pressure on the euro. That has not made him bearish on emerging market debt yet, but he is closely watching the market, Rosenberg told Reuters on the sidelines of the UBS CIO Global Forum in New York. “It’s been a really good environment for investing in emerging markets,” he said during the event. “We continue to favor them, however, we are now inching on the precipice of another theme reversal.” The dollar’s overall weakness has been a major contributor to the outperformance of many emerging markets assets this year, analysts and fund managers say. A fall by the euro against the dollar would strengthen the greenback, potentially reversing that trade. Germany could face months of coalition talks following last weekend’s election, increasing uncertainty. That could also refocus investor attention on other political events in Europe, such as an independence referendum in Spain and Italian elections next year, driving the euro lower. The single currency has faced additional pressure since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi singled out currency volatility as a source of uncertainty that required monitoring and argued that “ample” ECB accommodation was still needed. That could mean a “convergence” in the return spreads between the greenback and emerging market currencies as well as emerging market local currency-denominated bonds, Rosenberg said. Local currency emerging market bonds have been among the top performing assets this year. “A weak dollar tailwinds global investment, so a stronger dollar then makes us have to rethink some of those (foreign exchange) exposures,” he said. The dollar came into September having suffered six consecutive months of declines against a basket of major trading partner currencies, and was 9.34 percent lower through August, the worst first eight months to a year for the currency since 1986.

1428,BLK,BlackRock pitches for shareholder protection as Asia bourses weigh dual-class listings,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong and Singapore bourses need to introduce shareholder protection measures if they allow companies with dual-classes of shares to list, BlackRock Inc’s (BLK.N) head of investment stewardship for Asia Pacific said on Tuesday. Hit by dwindling new listings and a growing number of Asian startups listing in the United States, both Singapore Exchange Ltd (SGXL.SI) and Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd (0388.HK) have proposed new rules to allow companies to sell shares with different voting rights. Introducing those changes may not help attract prospective initial public offering (IPO) candidates, mainly technology startups that choose New York, Pru Bennett told the Reuters Financial Regulation Summit. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was among several institutional investors opposing those changes in Hong Kong and Singapore as concerns grow that corporate governance in Asia Pacific would take a further hit.     “It’s the right thing for the exchanges to review what they’re doing to make sure they’re relevant and attracting the right companies and that they have some diversity amongst the listed companies on their boards,” Bennett said at her office in Hong Kong. “We are not supporters of weighted voting rights or dual class shares. We think it potentially detracts from shareholder rights.” The proposals come years after Chinese tech giants including Alibaba Group (BABA.N) and search company Baidu (BIDU.O) picked New York over Hong Kong, while more recently Singapore lost a $1 billion listing from homegrown e-commerce and digital payment firm Sea Ltd to the Big Apple. “There are many reasons the companies, particularly Chinese internet companies, list in the U.S. Dual class shares, weighted voting rights is a component of that, but I’m not convinced that it’s the main reason,” Bennett said. The number of public activist campaigns in Asia almost doubled in the first half of 2017 from levels seen in 2013 and 2014, with 38 companies facing calls from investors for greater transparency or fairer treatment to minority shareholders, according to research firm Activist Insight.  Despite that initial jump, the level of activity is forecast to decline to 65 for all of 2017 from the record 78 campaigns in 2016, it added. Shareholder activism from investors such as U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management Corp and others would continue in coming years in Asia, Bennett said.   But a major surge was unlikely because several companies in local markets in the region were controlled by a small number of large shareholders, reducing the likelihood of success in activist campaigns, she added. With 17 companies facing public campaigns, Japan took the lead among Asian countries, and it could remain a top market for activists. “When you’ve got an incompetent board that’s a bit of a magnet for someone to come in and try to make changes because incompetent boards generally don’t make as good decisions as a competent board,” Bennett said about issues in Japan. “It’s a bit like when you’re in Africa and you see the gazelles running and the slow one at the back gets eaten by the lion.” Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits    ",9262017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-summit-regulation-blackrock/blackrock-pitches-for-shareholder-protection-as-asia-bourses-weigh-dual-class-listings-idUSKCN1C10KD

1431,BLK,Bank watchdogs in final reform effort as fatigue sets in,"LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Reforms aimed at preventing a repeat of the financial crisis a decade ago face a critical test this week when global regulators try to put the finishing touches to one of their main pillars. Watchdogs from the world’s leading financial centers have been trying for more than a year to finalize Basel III, their central response to the 2007-09 crisis that forced taxpayers into multi-billion dollar bailouts of undercapitalized banks. Amid signs that the appetite for global rulemaking is waning after one of the most intensive bouts of banking reform in history, the Basel Committee of banking supervisors meet next week in an attempt to complete the Basel III capital accord. Speakers at last week’s Reuters Financial Regulation Summit emphasized the urgent need to agree a deal, as failure to do so would call into question their global coordination. “If somehow we can’t agree amongst ourselves, that will send a very bad signal,” BoE Deputy Governor Sam Woods said. The United States and Europe are split over one arcane but crucial remaining element of the package, the extent to which banks can rely on their own internal risk models.  “Whether or not we can get that deal agreed will be a very important signal about whether we can continue to develop and maintain international standards,” Woods told the Summit. Banks have been lobbying for a loosening of the regulatory noose and called for a break to new rules due to the rising costs involved and the impact it has on their profitability. Regulators at the Reuters Financial Regulation Summit stressed they were now moving on to reviewing and tweaking what has been agreed, rather than cooking up major new reforms. “There’s an over reliance on regulation solving the problems of the capital markets and it can only go so far,” Paul Winkelmann, chief executive of Hong Kong’s Financial Reporting Council, an accounting watchdog, said. But Andrea Enria, chair of the European Banking Authority, which writes banking rules, insisted regulators were not running out of steam, but making sure reform programs are completed. “I don’t think we need to always launch new regulatory initiatives,” Enria said. European and Asian regulators are watching the United States, where president Donald Trump has told U.S. regulators to ease up on rule-making to encourage more bank lending. Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has recommended delaying new global bank trading book rules, a step Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore are also taking - and the European Union is resisting, potentially fragmenting standards for a period. “My sense is the mood has changed in the U.S., you can see very clearly in the Mnuchin report a desire to move the pendulum back a little bit,” Woods said. “I would say they have been pretty robust on bank capital in a way that I think is good, so if they tack back a little bit it’s not obvious that would present a problem for us.” This is the moving backdrop against which the Basel Committee of banking supervisors meets next week in Switzerland a bid to complete Basel III. “I am confident that we will reach an agreement before the end of the year,” said Enria, who sits on Basel’s oversight body, whose endorsement of a deal will be needed. Woods was “cautiously optimistic” though gave no timeline, while skeptical banks call for regulatory clarity. “It’s 50:50 for a deal this year,” Frederic Oudea, chief executive of French bank Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), told a banking event in Brussels last week. Insurance regulators are having an even tougher time trying to nail down a deal on global capital rules, with Europe and the United States wanting different calculation methods. “We will continue to work with our international colleagues to make sure that we will have this international capital standard in the coming years going in the right direction,” Gabriel Bernardino, who chairs the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), told the Summit. “We don’t envisage major changes in European insurance rules,” he added. Meanwhile banks, which are holding three times as much capital as they did before they had to be bailed out by taxpayers, face continuing costs for past misdeeds. “You can’t rely on the regulatory environment to solve all the problems,” said Pru Bennett, head of investment stewardship for Asia Pacific at BlackRock (BLK.N). There was a need to encourage firms to have good corporate governance and not just tick the compliance box, she said. Regulators interviewed at the Summit also stressed the need to adapt rules in a timely way as markets change. “Markets are very creative, and I am sure that new practices will emerge that allow them to minimize the impact of regulatory requirements, if not circumvent them altogether,” Enria said.

1433,BLK,Less than 18 pct of global stocks owned by index investors -BlackRock,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Less than 18 percent of the global stock market is owned by index-tracking investors, according to a new estimate from BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), as it suggested that passive investing plays only a limited role in setting equity prices. The estimate on Tuesday showed that $11.9 trillion in stocks were owned by mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, institutional accounts and private investors that track an index. That accounts for 17.5 percent of the $67.9 trillion in global equity market capitalization, according to the data. Stocks in actively managed hedge funds, mutual funds and institutional accounts total $17.4 trillion, 25.6 percent of the global equity market cap, according to the report. The remaining 57 percent are assets held by governments, pension funds, insurers or corporations. Such holdings are not overseen by an asset manager and do not track an index. The data comes as debate rages about the rise of funds that attempt to match the market at low cost rather than focus on beating the market. BlackRock - the world’s largest manager of ETFs, most of which are passive - released its data in a report disputing what its vice chairman, Barbara Novick, called “misinterpretations of information.”  BlackRock said active managers drive prices in the stock market, with $22 dollars by active stockpickers for every $1 traded by index funds, according to the firm’s data. Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) research unit said earlier this year that the stocks most held by passive investors have seen wider price swings. Their report pegged passive ownership of U.S. equity funds at 37 percent, up from 19 percent in 2009, though that analysis was limited to funds and did not include an estimate of privately held assets. Oaktree Capital Management LP Co-Chairman Howard Marks told clients this summer that active managers’ underperformance could be temporary and that ETFs’ “promise of liquidity has yet to be tested in a major bear market.” A report last year by broker-dealer Sanford C. Bernstein & Co LLC described passive investing as promoting a system of capital allocation worse than both capitalism and Marxism in which shares in the biggest companies are bought blindly. This year alone, U.S.-based equity ETFs have gathered $214 billion and index mutual funds attracted another $111 billion, while actively managed funds bled $124 billion in withdrawals, according to Thomson Reuters’ Lipper research unit. More value is exchanged daily in the top ETFs like the SPDR S&P; 500 ETF (SPY.P) and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM.P) than in most stocks.

1434,BLK,BlackRock CEO says U.S. tax reform plan will have to be amended,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Larry Fink on Tuesday said a U.S. tax plan backed by the Trump administration cannot be passed as it is, noting the proposal would add to the deficit. “I think it’s going to have to be amended,” said Fink, whose company is the world’s largest asset manager, in an interview with Bloomberg Television. The Trump administration outlined a proposal last week that would provide $5.99 trillion in tax cuts while reducing federal revenues by a net $2.4 trillion in the next 10 years, according to a first detailed analysis of the plan by the non-profit Washington-based Tax Policy Center. Fink said he is concerned that deficits could expand even as the U.S. elderly population grows, raising the cost of social-insurance programs and forcing the United States government to fund its spending by borrowing abroad. He also said he opposes an element of the administration’s proposal that would prevent taxpayers from deducting certain expenses, including levies paid to state and local governments. While Fink said markets are fine and will do well until the end of the year, he noted that he sees more “value” outside the United States. BlackRock manages $5.7 trillion. Fink said he expects Trump to nominate more “moderate” candidates to serve on the U.S. Federal Reserve than Republicans have in the past, likely portending no major changes in the direction of monetary policy. Regarding a fierce debate over the utility of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin BTC=BTSP, Fink described himself as ""a big believer in the potential of what a cryptocurrency can do."" But he added that the digital currencies are currently being used for ""money laundering"" and speculation. JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon last month said bitcoin, which has soared nearly 350 percent this year, “is a fraud” and will blow up. But Fidelity Investments struck a more optimistic note, starting its own bitcoin “mining” operation to create new coins. Fink also said that BlackRock will ramp up its in-house investment research following new European Union rules due to go live in January 2018. As part of the EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or Mifid II, asset managers will have to agree on a price for all research obtained from brokers.  Most research currently is given out for free, with brokers recouping the cost through fees on executing trades for fund managers.

1437,BLK,BlackRock hires former Obama climate adviser: memo,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), on Tuesday hired the Obama administration’s one-time adviser on climate change to lead an effort to appeal to people who want to invest in a way that helps society. BlackRock is bringing in Brian Deese to run its recently-renamed Sustainable Investing group, according to a company memo seen by Reuters. Deese helped negotiate the Paris agreement on climate change, from which Obama’s successor, U.S. President Donald Trump, has said he wants to withdraw. Wall Street is increasingly championing environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) standards to attract younger investors and institutions like universities and religious organizations that want to align their portfolios with their values. BlackRock has previously said investors should factor climate change into their decision-making and that doing so would not mean having to accept inferior returns. Yet its ESG growth has been muted. BlackRock’s sustainable unit manages $195 billion, spokesman Ed Sweeney said. That is down from more than $225 billion in February 2015, when BlackRock announced plans to coordinate its efforts in the space. At the time BlackRock tapped former anti-poverty campaigner Deborah Winshel to oversee the initiative, known previously as BlackRock Impact, and to lead its philanthropic program. Winshel will now focus full-time on philanthropy, the memo said. She could not be reached for comment. Growth in products that pursue social goals and investments in companies with strong ESG track records have partially offset a decline in assets in investments that screen out certain stocks or bonds, said Sweeney. Deese will enlist specialists in climate and use of natural resources and add a chief investment officer for sustainable investing to work with the company’s portfolio managers, according to the memo, which was signed by BlackRock Global Head of Multi-Asset Strategies Richard Kushel. Deese was also previously involved in developing the Obama administration’s bailout of the U.S. auto industry, budget deals with Congress and an unsuccessful effort to nominate Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court. He declined to comment. ",10102017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-moves-brian-deese/blackrock-hires-former-obama-climate-adviser-memo-idUSKBN1CF2GS

1439,BLK,"UPDATE 3-Procter & Gamble foresees proxy war victory, Peltz refuses to concede","(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said on Tuesday activist hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz lost his fight to win a seat on the company’s board, according to a preliminary tally of shareholder votes in the biggest and most expensive proxy contest ever. Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management LP owns a $3.5 billion stake in the world’s largest consumer products maker by market capitalization, refused to concede defeat, saying the vote was too close to call before the certified results are released. Sources said the difference in for and against votes for Peltz’s board director nomination was well within one percentage point. An independent inspector is expected to review and certify the votes this month and Trian could then legally  challenge the result. “We anticipate Peltz, who has taken issue with the firm’s organizational structure, corporate governance, and recent financial performance, to contest the vote,” Morningstar analyst Erin Lash said.   If the outcome is confirmed, it would be a bruising loss for Peltz, given that P&G; sought to turn the proxy contest into a referendum on his credentials as a seasoned executive in the consumer sector, with board director experience at Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O). Peltz had called for the maker of Pampers diapers, Gillette razors and Tide laundry detergent to reorganize into three business units: beauty, grooming and healthcare; fabric and home care and baby, feminine and family care. P&G;, led by Chief Executive David Taylor, countered that management is already working on several operational changes, and that Peltz does not have the relevant experience to be helpful in the process. “I shook (Peltz’s) hand, he shook my hand, and we said that just like we have through this proxy contest... folks want to make it a fight, but it is about ideas and the future. I told Nelson I will continue to listen to him as I have throughout this,” Taylor told a news conference after the shareholder meeting. P&G; shares were down 1 percent at $91.12 in afternoon trading in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of $232 billion. Its shares have risen 8.3 percent year-to-date, roughly in line with the S&P; 500 Household Products Index .SPLRCPROD, which is up 8.5 percent. Peltz was widely seen as the favorite to win the contest, because he had the backing of all three top shareholder advisory firms, which recommend how mutual funds should cast their vote, and was only seeking one board seat on P&G;’s 11-member board. “Win or lose, Nelson Peltz has taken the activist campaign to the largest companies, which have previously been able to inoculate themselves from these kind of experiences by spending enough money to keep activists at bay,” said Bruce Goldfarb, founder of Okapi Partners, which advises on proxy contests. Several activist shareholders have won a seat on the boards of companies over the years by arguing there was no harm in them bringing onboard a fresh perspective. Trian’s defeat could embolden corporate America to push back more against activists. The two sides collectively spent more than an estimated $100 million on mailings, phone calls and advertisements to woo investors.  Vanguard Group Inc, State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) are P&G;’s top three shareholders. State Street and BlackRock sided with Peltz, but Vanguard backed P&G;, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Individual stock owners, such as retirees and amateur stock pickers, collectively hold about 40 percent of the company’s stock, a much higher proportion than at most big companies. P&G;’s large retail base is due, in part, to long-running stock-based incentive plans for employees and the attraction of its well-known brand names for “mom and pop” investors. Analysts said this large pool of individual stock owners played a big part in Trian’s apparent defeat. They comprise mostly of P&G; employees and retirees, who are loyal to management and can be wary of Wall Street’s intentions. “At P&G;, the proxy advisers are not going to have the same sway over retail investors,” said Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor who follows corporate governance.  This is only the third time Trian has waged a proxy contest in its 12-year history. Two years ago it narrowly lost a fight with DuPont, although within a year the company’s CEO was out a job and a faster cost cutting was underway.

1442,BLK,Trian's Peltz to face close Procter & Gamble shareholder vote,"Oct 10 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co on Tuesday will become the biggest ever company to face a shareholder vote over a proxy contest, seeking to prevent activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP CEO Nelson Peltz from securing a seat on its board of directors. After the two sides collectively spent more than an estimated $100 million on mailings, phone calls and advertisements to woo investors, the outcome as of late Monday was too close to call, according to sources who had estimates of a preliminary voting tally.

1443,BLK,BlackRock closes in on $6 trillion in assets as index funds boom,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is closing in on an industry-record $6 trillion in assets under management as investors storm into the company’s index funds and the bull market in U.S. stocks rages on. The world’s biggest asset manager reported an 8.2 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, beating Wall Street estimates on almost every count as it attracted $96 billion, with about half of that moving into relatively low-cost exchange-traded funds. None of BlackRock’s publicly traded peers are expected to have gathered even 10 percent of that amount in the same quarter and four in 10 will report outflows, according to Morgan Stanley (MS.N). The increase in assets under management to $5.98 trillion, a figure on par with Japan’s gross domestic product, along with strong investment performance boosted revenue by 14 percent.  That marked the first time since the fourth quarter of 2015 that the company’s sales beat analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “It’s a great company,” said Cathy Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA Research. “It’s well managed. I think they’re moving in the right direction.” The stock rose 1.81 percent on Wednesday. Shares have returned nearly 27 percent this year, including dividends. Index-tracking ETFs have gained popularity among investors in recent years and are responsible for the lion’s share of the hundreds of billions in cash that BlackRock pulls in annually. But they have also drained assets away from traditional stockpickers who typically charge higher fees. BlackRock’s third-quarter profit spiked to $947 million from $875 million a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $5.92 per share, topping analyst expectations of $5.56, according to I/B/E/S. Active funds overall took in $5.8 billion for BlackRock during the quarter, and helped the company book more fees for beating performance targets. Such fees rose by $133 million to $191 million from a year ago. BlackRock said in March it would cut fees, change portfolio managers and rely more on data crunching for a number of equity products. By BlackRock’s reckoning, more than eight in 10 client dollars across its actively managed stock funds are in products  beating their benchmarks over three years. The figure is improved from a year ago. Still, active funds specializing in stocks posted outflows that topped $3 billion for the quarter. Some of the withdrawals were expected following the March revamp, Chief Executive Larry Fink said in an interview. “I would not expect to see any major reversal in active equities until some time next year,” Fink said. BlackRock Chief Financial Officer Gary Shedlin said on a conference call with analysts that pricing structures are always under review, and that BlackRock could consider implementing so-called fulcrum fees that reflect changes in performance. Fund managers’ stockpicking performance generally has picked up but that is not yet reflected in sales, analyst Jeremy Campbell with Barclays plc (BARC.L) said.  “You should see it inflect at some point, the question is just how much of a lag is there,” he said.

1444,BLK,BlackRock's Fink warns of risk of inverted bond yield curve,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Larry Fink on Wednesday warned that strong demand for investments such as long-dated government bonds could push their prices to a risky point. The head of the world’s largest asset management company said investors’ appetite for those assets could move long-dated yields below those of shorter-term debt. That condition, known as an inverted yield curve, is often considered a precursor to recession and could presage a decline for stocks. “If there is a risk, it’s that,” Fink said in an interview. “I hope the Federal Reserve pays attention.” However, he said he did not see an inverted yield curve materializing within the next year as global economic growth  accelerates. U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to decide this month on a nominee for the Federal Reserve chair, who strongly influences interest rates.  “All of the publicized names are very qualified for that role,” Fink said of the potential candidates. “I do believe whoever is the chair, whoever is added to the Federal Reserve, will have a giant task in front of them.” Potential Fed chair candidates are widely seen to include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor. Trump has suggested he may reappoint Fed Chair Janet Yellen to the post. Despite nearly nine years of gains in U.S. stock markets, investors are flocking to bonds. Yields move inversely to prices, so demand pushes prices higher and yields lower. U.S.-based bond funds have brought in more than $2 for every $1 gathered by equity funds this year, according to data from Thomson Reuters’ Lipper research unit. BlackRock alone reported nearly $60 billion in bond fund inflows and another $20 billion in “cash management” products that also invest in debt during the third quarter, compared to $12 billion for equity funds. Longer-duration assets like 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds are purchased by individual savers, insurers, pension funds, governments and other investors to meet future spending needs. Economists and portfolio managers have argued that a shortage of safe assets like government bonds in developed markets has developed in the years since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Two Fed policies could affect the shape of the yield curve. The central bank is on a path to raise the short-term rate it controls. And it is starting this month to reduce its approximately $4.2 trillion in debt holdings.

1445,BLK,BlackRock weighing out-of-pocket payments globally for research: CEO,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) will consider paying out-of-pocket for the investment research the world’s largest asset manager consumes from banks globally, Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Wednesday. Currently big investment banks and brokerages send research notes on companies for free, with brokers recouping the cost through fees for handling trades for the asset managers. Yet a sweeping set of European Union rules due to take effect in January include a requirement for asset managers to agree on a price for research with brokers and either pay for it themselves or pass it on to investors. Most companies in Europe have agreed to assume the cost themselves, although leading U.S. fund houses have so far tended to do so only for clients in products directly impacted by the EU rules, the Markets in Financial Directive II, or MiFID II. A move by BlackRock, with nearly $6 trillion in assets, to pay for research globally and rely less on banks for investment ideas could spur its competitors to follow suit and ripple across a Wall Street already bloodied by declining stock trading fees. Asset managers paying for external research may be more selective about what analysis they want from brokerages, and may decide to produce more themselves, analysts said. That could pinch underperforming investment bank research and trading units, while boosting boutiques with strong research but no trading operations. “One should expect we will be addressing this worldwide,” Fink told Reuters in an interview. “We’re going to be looking at it.” After BlackRock announced last month plans to absorb costs of external research in the EU, several smaller competitors such as Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GS.N) and HSBC Global Asset Management (HSBA.L) said they would do the same. Already, brokers are wrestling with declining stock-trading commissions with volumes low as calm stock markets glide higher and competitive electronic markets whittle away fees. BlackRock slashed the amount it paid out in commissions to Wall Street firms for research by more than half for its largest mutual fund, Global Allocation Fund (MALOX.O), over the last two years, Reuters reported earlier this year. Fink said in July that the company had reduced the cost of trades by 80 percent in five years. Big firms like BlackRock can also afford to build their own research units in-house, and they are doing so. They already employ more than 300 research staff. On Wednesday, Fink told analysts on a conference call tied to its third-quarter earnings report that doing even more research in-house “will allow us to have more incremental and differentiated ideas,” potentially boosting returns. “It is my belief by having more proprietary research that we are going to have better active flows.” U.S. brokerages are prohibited from taking direct payment for research unless they are also registered as investment advisory firms, according to securities lawyers. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates brokers and asset managers, has not yet detailed plans to harmonize its rules with the European Union. Fink said BlackRock faces no timeline for a decision and is discussing the issue with clients. “We look at this as an opportunity, and we’re treating it as an opportunity,” he said during the conference call, adding that “we have to see how MiFID II works out in the European environment for us to have a real strong opinion globally.” Fink said he does not yet have a view on whether MiFID II should be a template for the rest of the world. One concern is that smaller public companies and private companies considering offering stock are getting less attention as equity research groups pull back from following lesser-known companies. “We are worried about what the impact will be with some of the small-cap companies that will - are - having trouble ... in getting people to follow them,” Fink said.

1446,BLK,UPDATE 3-BlackRock closes in on $6 trillion in assets as index funds boom,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is closing in on an industry-record $6 trillion in assets under management as investors storm into the company’s index funds and the bull market in U.S. stocks rages on. The world’s biggest asset manager reported an 8.2 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, beating Wall Street estimates on almost every count as it attracted $96 billion, with about half of that moving into relatively low-cost exchange-traded funds. None of BlackRock’s publicly traded peers are expected to have gathered even 10 percent of that amount in the same quarter and four in 10 will report outflows, according to Morgan Stanley (MS.N). The increase in assets under management to $5.98 trillion, a figure on par with Japan’s gross domestic product, along with strong investment performance boosted revenue by 14 percent.  That marked the first time since the fourth quarter of 2015 that the company’s sales beat analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “It’s a great company,” said Cathy Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA Research. “It’s well managed.

1452,BLK,BlackRock's Fink warns global surprise could drive stock market correction,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink warned on Friday that financial markets are ignoring underlying risks, which means there could be a “big correction” if a major surprise world event occurred. Fink, head of the world’s largest asset manager, said the  amount of risk in the financial system is comparable to 2007 levels. He said that consistently low volatility in the stock market, as well as the overall strength of the global economy, may mean markets are not accounting for that risk as much as they did in the past. “If there is a major event, which I don’t foresee anything, but if there is one, we could have a big correction,” he said at the annual meeting of the Institute of International Finance. All three major U.S. stock indexes have been on an extended rally this year, repeatedly setting new record highs, as investors anticipate expanded business activity thanks to a lighter regulatory road and potential tax cuts. A stock market correction is defined as a fall of at least 10 percent from the high point of the last 52 weeks. Fink spoke during a panel discussion alongside the CEOs of JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) - Jamie Dimon and James Gorman. All three were generally optimistic about the economy, although they highlighted several significant risks. Fink said there is no evident economic reason for a major spike in volatility in the near future.  “Over the long horizon, I think the world is a great place to be,” he said. But all three CEOs found ample room to criticize the White House and the U.S. Congress for failing to take any major steps to boost the nation’s economy.  Dimon said the steady if not spectacular U.S. economic growth has occurred “in spite” of the failure in Washington to act.  “We have got to get our act together,” he said, adding that the United States needs to spend more on infrastructure. The three also emphasized the importance of cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate - something that President Donald Trump has been promising as part of his tax plan - warning that a failure to do so by Congress could upend the strong run in the U.S. stock markets in 2017. “If nothing gets done on the corporate tax, that’ll be a big disappointment,” warned Gorman. “That’ll take a lot of energy out of the market.” On economic policy, Fink said he believes Trump has considered well-qualified candidates to serve as the next chair of the Federal Reserve to succeed Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February. He said he hoped the next central bank head would continue the “glide path” on gradually raising interest rates established by Yellen. And one day after vowing never to address the topic again, Dimon again assailed bitcoin, the cryptocurrency which he previously called a “fraud.” People who invest in it “stupid” and will “pay the price someday,” Dimon said. He did identify some value in blockchain technology, which underpins bitcoin, but said that any completely anonymous cryptocurrency not backed by any government will not last forever. “Governments are going to crush [bitcoin] one day,” Dimon said. “Governments like to know where the money is, who has it, and what they’re doing with it.” ",10132017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iif-banks/blackrocks-fink-warns-global-surprise-could-drive-stock-market-correction-idUSKBN1CI2M5

1457,BLK,BlackRock opposes banning companies from indexes over voting rights,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's largest asset manager, is lambasting the architects of market indexes like the S&P; 500 .SPX for ostracizing companies that deny equal voting rights to shareholders, saying that doing so could limit the opportunities of investors in index funds. Snap Inc (SNAP.N), the parent company of messaging app Snapchat, made waves when it went public in a $3.4 billion offering last March with a class of common stock granting no voting rights, and it was later excluded from some market indexes. BlackRock has said it supports all shareholders getting an equal vote. Yet, in a report published on the company’s website on Monday, the manager of nearly $6 trillion in assets said it is up to regulators to set corporate-governance policies, not index providers. BlackRock said that, without regulatory changes, corporations should seek shareholders’ approval of capital structures that deprive some of voting rights, and that they should let shareholders exercise equal voting rights on specific topics, such as executive pay, that pose a conflict of interest. “While we understand entrepreneurs’ desire to maintain control of their company following an initial public offering, we believe that shareholders should have a say in critical decisions,” the BlackRock report said. “However, we disagree with index providers’ recent decisions to exclude certain companies from broad market indices due to governance concerns. Those decisions could limit our index-based clients’ access to the investable universe of public companies and deprive them of opportunities for returns.” FTSE Russell and S&P; Dow Jones Indices LLC said in July they would exclude Snap and companies with similar structures from certain stock indexes, citing concerns over their lack of voting rights. MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) in June proposed a plan that would exclude Snap and companies like it, and invited feedback. BlackRock’s opinion on the role of index providers in resolving the fraught corporate governance debate, which has not previously been reported, carries special weight because the company is a top provider of funds that track indexes. Vanguard Group, with $4.5 trillion in assets, has also said it believes companies like Snap should not “be excluded solely on the basis of voting limitations at this time.” BlackRock and Vanguard are top shareholders in companies around the world, and they vote proxy ballots that can change company directors and influence management policies.

His comments come as the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the country’s main sovereign wealth fund, is putting $20 billion into a $40-billion fund with Blackstone and unveiled plans to significantly boost its assets. “PIF is setting a new role in the investment world,” Prince Mohammed said in an interview. He said the fund would make money from both its recent joint investments with Japan’s SoftBank Group (9984.T) and with Blackstone. “That’s why we made a 20 percent profit with SoftBank in  five months. That’s why we established a ... fund in Blackstone, which is expected to make a 14 percent profit and create different fields and different investments. That’s why Blackstone and BlackRock are opening here,” he said. A spokeswoman for BlackRock, the world biggest fund manager, said that it intends to “open an office in the region to ensure we deliver the best service to our clients”. Blackstone declined to comment.

1470,BLK,BlackRock's Fink says bitcoin thrives on its anonymity," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin, whose value has fluctuated significantly this month, remains a “speculative” investment that thrives because of the cryptocurrency’s anonymous nature, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Monday.  “The reason why it does so well is it is anonymous. It’s anonymous, and it’s cross-border,” Fink, whose firm oversees nearly $6 trillion of assets, said at the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit. “If you legitimize it, you know who your counterparties are...the question is how many people will use it if you have to acknowledge you are a buyer or a seller.”  Fink called bitcoin a “very speculative instrument. More importantly, it is an instrument that people use for money laundering.”  The value of bitcoin plunged as much as 29 percent from its Nov. 8 record high of $7,888 following the cancellation of a planned technology upgrade and amid persistent concern of a bubble. Bitcoin recouped some of its losses on Monday.  Investors who have held bitcoin for the long term have fared well.  Even after the recent drop, its value has increased more than sixfold this year. Investors who held on longer have been rewarded even more: in 2011, bitcoin traded at below $3.  Fink, however, said most investors with long-term horizons, and who are keeping “record amounts” on the sidelines, should be focused on traditional assets such as stocks and bonds.  He said that for a 30-year-old person, “100 percent equities is the right investment strategy,” at a time when the world’s economies are enjoying “synchronized growth” for the first time since the financial crisis.

1471,BLK,BlackRock's Fink learns to live with activist investors,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Larry Fink, whose $6 trillion BlackRock Inc seldom picks a public fight with large companies, said on Monday that activist investors often help lay the groundwork for positive change in the corporate world. “The role of activists is getting larger, not smaller,” Fink said at the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit in New York, “in many cases their role is a good one.” BlackRock is one of the world’s largest so-called passive investors, which runs portfolios that largely mirror stock market indexes and sticks with the companies that are included in those indexes. Joking that BlackRock owns some of the world’s best and worst companies, Fink said the interaction between management and so-called activists who push top executives to perform better is often very productive for investors like his funds. Years ago, Fink made headlines by warning corporate chiefs that they should not be so quick to give in to corporate nudges’ demands.  Activist investors, which often include big-name hedge fund managers such as Nelson Peltz, Carl Icahn and William Ackman, have repeatedly asked corporate management to buy back more stock and raise their dividends, something Fink said could push up share prices in the short term but be less helpful in the long term. He said he is still worried about the short-term investment strategies and noted that activists often play those well. But he also gave them credit for setting the path for longer-term improvements. Even as Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management last week lost a bruising proxy battle with Automatic Data Processing, Fink said that the campaigns will bear fruit. At ADP, for example, Ackman pushed for management to become more efficient, deliver more robust earnings and consolidate its real estate footprint. “They may have lost but they are forcing change,” Fink said of activists, without discussing any specific proxy contest. BlackRock, whose votes are often instrumental to a proxy contest’s outcome, is now talking more openly about how it reaches its decisions on which way to vote. In May, BlackRock helped pass a shareholder resolution calling on Exxon Mobil Corp to provide more information about how new technologies and climate change regulations could impact the business of the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. Fink said the firm is only voting in the long-term interests of its investors, and that its responsibilities are growing as more money moves into its index funds and ETFs. The new detail around its proxy votes is what investors now expect, he said.    “The market is demanding it, I mean I would prefer never talking about it,” Fink said of the new explanations.

1472,BLK,"New faces at Fed seen sticking to current playbook, says BlackRock's Fink","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pending leadership changes at the U.S. Federal Reserve are not worrying to Larry Fink, who runs BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset management company, although he does fret about what the Fed is doing to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Fink described President Donald Trump’s recent selection of Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the next head of the U.S. central bank to succeed current Chair Janet Yellen as a “safe and wise” choice. “I’m not concerned about the transition,” he told the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit in New York. He is equally sanguine about a change at the top of the most important of the Fed’s 12 regional banks, the New York Fed, with which Wall Street’s biggest banks and asset managers like BlackRock deal on a daily basis. There, William Dudley announced last week he will retire as president in mid-2018, about a year earlier than most had expected.  “Filling the New York Fed job will be quite easy,” Fink said. While Fink declined to name a favorite candidate for the job, he said Peter Fisher, a former BlackRock executive who has worked at the Fed and the Treasury Department, would be a very qualified candidate. “Peter seems like a reasonable choice,” Fink said of Fisher, a Harvard-trained lawyer who is now a senior lecturer at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. Other potential successors to Dudley include Simon Potter, the current head of market operations at the New York Fed; Lorie Logan, the bank’s head of analysis and monitoring of market operations; and Brian Sack, who held the role before Potter and is now at hedge fund D.E. Shaw, market sources said. His confidence in Fed leadership aside, Fink voiced concern about worrying signals from the U.S. Treasury market, where short-term yields are rising, driven by Fed rate hikes, but long-term yields are not because inflation pressures are largely absent. This yield curve “flattening” is typically associated with slowing economic growth, and an outright yield curve inversion - in which short-term yields are higher than long-term ones - is often a precursor to recession. The spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields has narrowed from 135 basis points last December to around 71 basis points now, and it recently touched its tightest in a decade. (For a graphic on 'U.S. Yield Curve - An Economic Omen?' click reut.rs/2zVhQyJ) The Fed has raised rates by 1 percentage point over the last two years, and Fink sees another quarter-percentage-point rate hike from the Fed next month as essentially a done deal. Whether they deliver three more hikes next year as policy makers currently predict is another question, he said. “I think they’ll be data-dependent, like they are every time,” Fink said. “They’re going to tighten in December, pause, wait and see, and if they don’t see any obstacles in the marketplace to their path, they’ll do it again in March.” But should the Fed drive the yield curve into inversion,  that would spell trouble for stocks. “If we were to see a flat to an inverted yield curve, that would be a cause for equity pullback,” Fink said.

1479,BLK,RPT-REUTERS SUMMIT-BlackRock's Fink says no need for hysteria in markets,"(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to text) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said on Monday that global economic growth is synchronized for the first time since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and that signs of stress in riskier markets should not cause hysteria. But Fink warned that some investors’ comfort with calm markets could lead to “a setback” or even “a mess” if trades betting on placid markets start to do poorly. “Good markets, even good bull markets, have 5 and 10 percent corrections. We have not seen that,” said Fink, who spoke at the Reuters Global 2018 Investment Outlook Summit in New York. “When you mention the high-yield market being a little squeamish last week, in the scheme of things, who cares? It’s fine, it’s natural.” Global stocks edged away from recent record highs on Monday, after several days of price swings in markets from high yield to U.S. government bonds rattled a quiescent bull market. Yet Fink said global markets remain on sound footing, where it is hard to see “a real setback economically,” despite concerns over a U.S. tax reform deal as well as investors who are profiting by betting markets will stay calm. U.S. equity market volatility - the daily fluctuations in stock prices - has hovered near record lows for much of this year. That has pushed some investors to opt into a lucrative, but risky, trade using derivatives to bet that volatility will stay low or fall. Markets are eagerly anticipating a final U.S. tax bill that is expected to reduce corporate taxes and push up profits. Fink said the tax bill could push up profits but that more cheap money would not likely lead to higher levels of investment.

1481,BLK,Australia's Commonwealth Bank overcomes protest votes at testy AGM,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) easily overcame protest votes against executive remuneration and board appointments at an annual general meeting on Thursday, as it tries to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals. The remuneration report gained 91.4 percent support, lower than the near-unanimous result most large Australian companies get for that item, but enough to protect the A$142 billion ($108 billion) lender from a mandatory board spill. Shareholders also supported the appointment of a new independent director and three incumbents to the board of Australia’s biggest company. But in a sign of shareholder dissatisfaction, Andrew Mohl, the longest-serving of them, won only 84 percent of the vote. “It is good that the shareholders had their say,” Chairman Catherine Livingstone told Reuters after the three-hour meeting. In her address, Livingstone told shareholders the bank was determined to “rebuild trust” after Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, accused it of systemic failings to spot thousands of illegal transactions, some of which allegedly involved drug syndicates and terror financiers. The meeting was being watched for signs of a shareholder revolt. Under Australian corporation law, a second consecutive vote against CommBank’s remuneration report, following a “first strike” in 2016, could have forced it to spill the board.  In the end, the 2017 report was approved comfortably but not without some shareholders venting their unhappiness.  “Most of your executives ... are on A$1 million plus,” said Rodney Jeffrey, one of dozens of shareholders who addressed the meeting. “Why should there be an incentive system at all? Aren’t people committed to a company on that salary?” he asked, to cheers from the assembled investors.  The bank’s biggest shareholder, U.S. asset manager BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), said however that the board had “responded well to shareholder concerns”. Specifically, it welcomed changes to remuneration policy to clarify what benchmarks executives must meet to receive short-term bonuses.  CommBank also ditched last year’s plans to reward executives for subjective “people and community” targets, and introduced tests for bonuses against non-financial and reputation-building measures. CommBank slashed executive bonuses in response to the money-laundering lawsuit filed against it by AUSTRAC, which could expose the lender to billions of dollars in fines.  Chief Executive Officer Ian Narev, who has led the bank since December 2011, took a 46 percent pay cut and announced he would step down by next June. Still, the bank argues that most of the alleged money-laundering breaches were caused by a software glitch, and says it will contest its level of responsibility. It has until Dec. 15 to file its defense with the court. Australia’s corporate and banking regulators have started separate investigations, while shareholders have filed a class-action lawsuit.  CommBank shares plunged after AUSTRAC filed its lawsuit in early August, but have since recovered most of their losses. On Thursday afternoon they were 0.45 percent higher at A$81.03, in line with the broader market.

1482,BLK,UPDATE 1-Australia's Commonwealth Bank overcomes protest votes at testy AGM,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) easily overcame protest votes against executive remuneration and board appointments at an annual general meeting on Thursday, as it tries to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals. The remuneration report gained 91.4 percent support, lower than the near-unanimous result most large Australian companies get for that item, but enough to protect the A$142 billion ($108 billion) lender from a mandatory board spill. Shareholders also supported the appointment of a new independent director and three incumbents to the board of Australia’s biggest company. But in a sign of shareholder dissatisfaction, Andrew Mohl, the longest-serving of them, won only 84 percent of the vote. “It is good that the shareholders had their say,” Chairman Catherine Livingstone told Reuters after the three-hour meeting. In her address, Livingstone told shareholders the bank was determined to “rebuild trust” after Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, accused it of systemic failings to spot thousands of illegal transactions, some of which allegedly involved drug syndicates and terror financiers. The meeting was being watched for signs of a shareholder revolt.

1483,BLK,Narrow win for Fox shows restlessness with dual-class shares,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A shareholder proposal calling for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to scrap its dual-class share structure was rejected on Wednesday, although the measure received significant support among voters outside the controlling Murdoch family. Fifty-seven percent of votes cast sided with the position of Fox’s board, which argued that the current share structure provided flexibility and enhanced the company’s ability to focus on long-term results, a Fox regulatory filing said. The majority of Fox shares traded publicly are class A shares, which have no voting rights. The Murdoch family owns about 39 percent of the class B voting shares, according to a proxy from the company, which owns the Fox broadcast network, cable channels and a movie studio. Critics argue that the current set-up concentrates too much power with the Murdoch family. Forty-three percent of votes cast were in favor of eliminating the two classes of shares and giving all shares a vote. The vote was advisory, so passage would not have forced any changes at the company. Even so, it was noteworthy that more than half of shareholders outside of the Murdoch’s control voted in favor, said Paul Hodgson, an independent governance consultant. In addition to the family stake, 6.7 percent of the voting shares are held by ValueAct Capital, whose chief executive, Jeff Ubben, is also a Fox director. “The message the public shareholders are sending management is get rid of the dual voting class of shares,” Hodgson said. The measure’s supporters may use the results to try to persuade Fox management to meet with them to discuss the issue, he added. Kevin McManus, a vice president of proxy adviser Egan Jones, said the number of people voting against the dual voting class  marked “a very significant percentage and puts pressure on the company.” Laura Campos, a director at the reform measure’s sponsor, the Nathan Cummings Foundation, said Fox’s structure made change unlikely despite the result. “At many companies, 43 percent would be more than enough to prompt serious action from the board. At a company with a dual-class capital structure, it’s less likely that we’ll see any sort of substantive response from the board,” she said via email. Asked about the result, a Fox spokesman sent remarks by director Viet Dinh, who said at the company’s annual meeting that the board believed the current structure was valued by shareholders. “The board believes that many are attracted to our stock by the dual class structure and stability and leadership provided by the Murdoch family, both of which have contributed to the long-term success of the company,” Dinh said. Major mutual fund firms have been pushing the importance of equal voting rights as a way to improve the way companies are run. Fund executives worry about cases like technology initial public offerings such as Snap Inc, which offered outside investors no voting rights. The fear is that unequal voting structures concentrate too much power in the hands of insiders.     At a 26-minute annual meeting on Fox’s movie and television studio lot in Los Angeles, shareholders on Wednesday also easily re-elected Rupert Murdoch and his two sons to the company’s board, suggesting continued support for the family even as its Fox News division is recovering from a series of costly sexual harassment settlements.  That issue has slowed Britain’s regulatory review of the company’s bid to take over broadcaster Sky Plc. Co-Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch, speaking at the annual meeting, said the company was confident the deal would close by the middle of next year. Fox also has recently talked to Walt Disney Co about selling much of itself, according to a CNBC report. The company did not directly address that matter during the meeting but said it was confident in its current assets. “We have the required scale to continue to execute on our aggressive growth strategy,” Lachlan Murdoch said.  The proposed new voting structure is aimed at beefing up investor oversight over Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James, who are all Fox board members.  “This structure leaves some shareholders with disproportionate voting power and others with none at all. We think eliminating it would benefit the shareholders and the company,” said Roxana Tynan, speaking on behalf of the foundation. The current structure, she said, “can create corporate cultures with no accountability.”  On another advisory measure, 78 percent of votes cast were in support of Fox executives’ annual compensation.

1484,BLK,BlackRock: Don't look for double-digit returns in Australia,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The chief investment officer of BlackRock Inc’s Australian arm said on Friday that investors should not expect double-digit gains from the country’s stock market in the near-term.  “We don’t think that over the next one year, three years, the expectation for Australian equities is for double digit returns,” Michael McCorry said in an interview at the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit.   “We think there are better opportunities,” said the CIO of BlackRock Australia. In Australia, where BlackRock manages A$91.5 billion  ($69.49billion) for clients across equities, fixed income, and real estate assets, the firm is currently “neutral” on local equities. McCorry noted the market’s high exposure to banks that were facing increased regulation and capital requirements; as well as commodities, where he expected prices to fall slightly in the medium term. He said investors should have Australian equities in their portfolios, but it’s “very important to have exposure to so many of the sectors you just can’t get exposure to” in the country, such as technology and manufacturing. Heading into 2018, BlackRock is “reasonably positive about global growth, including China,” he said. “We like Asia-Pacific, in this environment.” MSCI’s benchmark emerging stocks index is up around 30 percent this year, making it the top-performing major asset class. And McCorry said he expected to see more investment flows into the asset class, as it still offered attractive valuations because those stocks were “increasingly tilted toward growth companies.” Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits.

1485,BLK,BlackRock plans new active sector ETFs curated by robots,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is turning to the robots for its next big investment idea. The world’s largest asset manager, which oversees nearly $6 trillion, has hatched plans for a set of exchange-traded funds that would let a computer program choose and classify stocks, according to preliminary filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The actively managed “iShares Evolved” funds will target major industry groupings: financials, healthcare, media, consumer staples, consumer discretionary and, of course, technology. Investors often rely on sector definitions determined by index companies like S&P; Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc (MSCI.N), who control the Global Industry Classification Standard. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is not considered an information technology company, but is listed alongside auto parts sellers and other retailers as a consumer discretionary stock. Tobacco companies are considered a consumer staple.  But unlike traditional passive funds that rely on those indexes, BlackRock’s new funds will use advanced data science techniques - such as machine learning - to choose which companies go where. “The classification system allows for a company to be classified into multiple sectors rather than being assigned solely to a single sector, reflecting the multi-dimensional nature of these companies,” BlackRock said in the filings. “Sector constituents are expected to evolve dynamically over time to reflect changing business models.” A BlackRock spokeswoman declined to comment beyond those documents. The company has for years been using data science techniques in its actively managed funds for large and institutional investors, but has been bringing more of those techniques to funds intended for everyday investors. The new funds also mark another move by BlackRock to introduce new products reliant on its own intellectual property rather than through the tracking of a benchmark built by a traditional index provider. In July, BlackRock launched bond ETFs tracking benchmarks built by itself for the first time. The robotic ETFs come as S&P; and MSCI both are engineering a massive shakeup of their 11-sector schematic. The shrinking telecommunications sector is being ditched in favor of a gleaming new “Communication Services” sector that is likely to include at least some of the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) - along with traditional telecom or media players, such as AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).

The hire is the latest move by Evercore to boost its practice of defending companies from activist shareholders and hostile takeovers and advising them on corporate governance. It follows the bank’s hiring two years ago of Bill Anderson, who was previously head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s shareholder activism defense business.

Evercore declined to comment, while Oleksiuk did not respond to a request for comment. At BlackRock, Oleksiuk had a voice in how the fund manager cast proxy votes at thousands of corporations each year. With roughly $6 trillion under management as of Sept. 30, BlackRock is the largest shareholder in many U.S. corporations, giving it a powerful voice on their operations and board makeup. Evercore has used its shareholder activism defense practice to boost its mergers and acquisitions franchise and land roles in high-profile deals.

Kapito said at a question-and-answer session in New York that cash is also likely to enter the debt market over the long term, keeping interest rates low. Gravity-defying equities and high-priced, low-yielding bonds in the United States have surprised many investors who predicted either or both markets would short-circuit. U.S. stocks have been in a bull market for the better part of a decade, while the benchmark 10-year U.S. note US10YT=RR yield has not breached 2.65 percent in three years.

BlackRock is the world’s largest fund manager, overseeing nearly $6 trillion.  Kapito’s remarks anticipating more of the same - low bond yields and high stock prices - echo those he has made at investor events in recent years. Companies reluctant to invest in their businesses have been funneling money into share repurchases and dividend payouts, he said, while private companies have been reluctant to go public. That has conspired to decrease the amount of stock available in the market, according to Kapito, while central banks reckoning with the financial crisis have pushed bond yields lower. “You may not want to hear this, but there’s not enough stock to buy, and there’s not enough bonds that have any yield to buy,” he said, adding that investors are going to get tired of earning little to nothing on their cash and will move that money into capital markets. “There’s a high probability that stocks across the globe are going to rise.” ",12052017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-conference-blackrock/blackrock-president-says-stocks-likely-to-rise-as-investors-shuffle-cash-idUSKBN1DZ32E
1495,BLK,'Responsible' investor group toughens code on global members,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A UN supported group pushing for “responsible” investment said it has adopted tougher rules aimed at making fund managers deliver on pledges to pay attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The requirements described in recent interviews by leaders of the UK-based Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) include that signatories adopt policies that describe their approach to responsible investing and that top executives oversee the work. Laggards could be delisted starting in 2020.  The new rules pose a test for U.S. asset managers led by BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. These firms lately have emphasized ESG factors but some responsible investment activists want them to push for further changes at companies whose shares they hold. Once seen as irrelevant by many financial executives, ESG issues have taken on a new importance as a way for asset managers to distinguish themselves to clients.  Currently about 200 of the PRI’s membership of 1,873 would not meet the new standards, said Fiona Reynolds, the group’s managing director, in a recent telephone interview. She declined to name specific under-performers but said the general view among members is that “Those that have no commitment to doing anything should not be able to use the PRI brand.” By some measures 2017 was a watershed year for ESG efforts. BlackRock and Vanguard each cast rare votes in support of a measure on climate issues at Exxon Mobil Corp this year, for instance, while State Street Corp drew attention for its boardroom diversity efforts. Yet all three firms have faced calls to take further steps like backing critical shareholder resolutions more often.  A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.  A Vanguard spokeswoman said the firm is “actively engaged” with the PRI, and sent a statement from Vanguard Chairman Bill McNabb that “Our PRI membership is a natural extension of the Vanguard mission.” State Street executives said the firm was given the PRI’s highest grade, an “A+,” in a review of its strategy and governance, the broadest area the PRI evaluated. All three firms employ ESG specialists and have been publishing more ESG reports and policies, which should help satisfy the new requirements.  Asked if that means those managers are less likely to be delisted than smaller ones with fewer resources to devote, Reynolds said big firms are “not always” the ones with the strongest commitment to ESG practices.  “Size is no guarantee of success,” she said.

Companies reluctant to invest in their businesses have been funneling money into share repurchases and dividend payouts, he said, while private companies have been reluctant to go public. That has conspired to decrease the amount of stock available in the market, according to Kapito, while central banks reckoning with the financial crisis have pushed bond yields lower. “You may not want to hear this, but there’s not enough stock to buy, and there’s not enough bonds that have any yield to buy,” he said, adding that investors are going to get tired of earning little to nothing on their cash and will move that money into capital markets. “There’s a high probability that stocks across the globe are going to rise.” ",12052017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-conference-blackrock/update-1-blackrock-president-says-stocks-likely-to-rise-as-investors-shuffle-cash-idUSL1N1O52C1

The motion has been brought by activist hedge fund TCI Fund Management, which is unhappy with Brydon’s handling of the succession of Xavier Rolet, the LSE’s former chief executive. BlackRock, LSE and TCI declined to comment. The Qatar Investment Authority, another big LSE shareholder, is also due to support Brydon at the shareholder meeting next Tuesday. TCI, the hedge fund firm run by Christopher Hohn, is not expecting to pass the resolution to oust Brydon, a source close to the firm has told Reuters. Shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services have previously recommended shareholders vote against removing Brydon.

1502,BLK,UPDATE 3-Deckers wins proxy contest against hedge fund Marcato,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Deckers Outdoor Corp beat back a challenge from activist hedge fund Marcato Capital Management, but shares of the maker of UGG boots fell more than 4 percent on news that all its directors had been re-elected. Shareholders voted to return all nine board members to their positions, the company said in a statement. They rebuffed Marcato’s effort to replace the three most senior directors with the hedge fund’s own candidates. Thursday’s result caps a 10-month long battle between Deckers and Marcato, which has been prodding management to consider spinoffs, cut costs, and allocate capital more wisely. “Today’s outcome reaffirms that we are on the right track,” the company’s statement said on Thursday. A week ago the company warned investors that Marcato’s candidates “lack the relevant skills and experience to continue our successful transformation.”  Marcato owns 8.5 percent of the company and had won votes from many other active investors, including other hedge funds. However passive investors, BlackRock Inc and Vanguard, which both run big index funds and rank among Deckers’ top five investors, voted to back management’s directors, two people familiar with the situation said on Thursday. Proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones threw their weight behind management while ISS backed the hedge fund. Late last week ISS took an unusual step by reversing its recommendation after Marcato slimmed its slate to three directors after having initially campaigned to throw out all nine. In its report, Glass Lewis said positive changes made both before and after Marcato arrived on the scene were beginning to take hold, suggesting stronger earnings lie ahead. Deckers shares had climbed 71.4 percent since Marcato disclosed its stake in the company on Feb. 8, but on Thursday they dropped more than 4 percent. Several Deckers investors, who said they had backed the hedge fund’s slate, wondered whether Marcato might now exit the stock to focus on other targets. Its main portfolio has returned 24 percent this year, beating the average hedge fund’s roughly 8 percent gain. Marcato founder Mick McGuire on Thursday said his involvement had already benefited shareholders but warned that more work lay ahead.  “We continue to believe that the status quo at Deckers is unacceptable,” he said in a statement, “and the Board must take meaningful steps to avoid repeating its many historical failures.” In November Deckers said it plans to refresh its board by appointing at least two independent directors by September 2018.

1506,BLK,"BlackRock hits record $6 trillion assets, helped by Trump tax law","NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) charged past a record $6 trillion in assets, its profit beating Wall Street forecasts, as investors flooded into the relatively low-cost funds of the world’s largest asset manager. A new U.S. tax law, which sliced corporate and individual income rates, also helped the company’s results in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. BlackRock said on Friday it saw a $1.2 billion tax benefit related to the law and raised its quarterly cash dividend by 15 percent. “We’ve been winning more share of wallet,” Chief Executive Larry Fink told Reuters. “Fees are really important and are becoming more important.” Fink said the tax reform was putting more money in his clients’ pockets, which they would need to invest, and that the increased cash could allow him to invest more in the company’s future. He declined to identify such investments but said they were discussed at the company’s board meeting. The New York-based company’s shares were up 2.8 percent at midday. Its shares have gained 47 percent over the last year, including dividends. “Just when we thought, after the third-quarter report, things couldn’t get better, it seems that they did,” said Edward Woods, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Inc, which owns BlackRock shares. Strong economic growth, tame inflation and supportive government policies propped up assets in 2017, with most countries’ equity markets recording gains, often at double-digit percentages. BlackRock has the largest lineup of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), many of which “passively” track segments of the market at a relatively low fee. Investors’ embrace of those funds caught many of BlackRock’s once-larger competitors flat-footed. BlackRock said its iShares ETF business took in $54.8 billion in new money in the quarter, up from $49.3 billion a year earlier. The $367 billion the company took in from investors in 2017 overall was a record, while assets under management expanded to $6.29 trillion. “Our view is this acceleration - we saw 18 percent growth rate last year - we think something like that is going to continue for the next couple of years,” said Jennifer Grancio, a managing director at BlackRock focused on the iShares business. Portfolio managers at BlackRock who try to beat the market also posted a strong year, with 76 percent of the fund’s actively managed assets in funds ranked in the top half of their Thomson Reuters Lipper category over three years as of November, according to Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S). “As more funds flow into passive investing, active management should have better performance, and I think that’s what we’re experiencing,” said Fink. “There is a need for passive, there is a need for active.” BlackRock shareholders and analysts said they are keeping a close eye on how fast expenses are rising and fees are falling given the demand for lower-fee products. General and administration expenses for the quarter rose 26 percent in the quarter to $448 million, compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, BlackRock earned an annualized $19.28 for every $10,000 it managed during the quarter, down from $19.51 the prior quarter, excluding cash-like money-market funds, according to Reuters’ calculations. Fink, whose succession plan has long been subject to speculation, said he has no intention to leave his post. But he added that “we won’t be here forever” and that the company had issued a one-time equity grant “to a small group of senior leaders” that will pay out over five to seven years and is “focused on ensuring the interest of the next-generation leaders, individuals who we believe will play critical roles in BlackRock’s future.” BlackRock’s net income surged to $2.3 billion, or $14.07 per share, from $851 million, or $5.13 per share, a year earlier. The company said its effective tax rate would fall to 23 percent, from closer to 30 percent, which could boost its profitability 6 to 7 percent this year, according to Edward D. Jones & Co LP.  Excluding the benefit from the new tax law, BlackRock earned $6.24 per share. Analysts on average expected the company to earn $6.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1508,BLK,"BlackRock, Alliance Bernstein tapping more into electronic bond trading"," (This January 11 story, corrects name of firm in headline, 1st, 2nd, 4th and 10th paragraphs to Alliance Bernstein from Vanguard) By John McCrank NEW YORK (Reuters) - Electronic trading is becoming increasingly important when it comes to corporate debt as fund management firms try to knit together sources of liquidity in a fragmented market, executives from Alliance Bernstein LP and BlackRock Inc said on Thursday.   “Our goal by the end of the year is that every trade we do is going to be done electronically,” Jim Switzer, global head of credit trading at Alliance Bernstein, said at the inaugural meeting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee.  That does not mean traders will not pick up the phone to make a trade anymore, but it does mean that all of those trades will be processed electronically, he said.     Putting the information together electronically gives Alliance Bernstein a much better picture of the liquidity available in the market, making it easier to get the next trade done quickly, he said.  BlackRock also aims to capture all of its bond trades electronically, said Richie Prager, head of trading, liquidity and investments platform at the world’s largest fund manager, which oversees $6 trillion in assets. Around two-thirds of BlackRock’s corporate debt transactions are now done electronically, Prager said at the SEC meeting. By volume, however, that number drops to around 30 percent, pointing to the lasting importance of large block trades done by voice, especially for less standardized offerings, he added. But electronic trading venues do help marry up the fragmented liquidity across the market, Prager said. Electronic trading platforms have proliferated in recent years in the over-the-counter debt market as big banks have scaled back their bond dealing in response to post-financial crisis rules that make such activity more expensive.  The pullback by banks has raised concerns about a liquidity crunch as U.S. interest rates rise and the market heats up. That has helped drive the shift to more electronic trading, as well as automation, to make sense of an often opaque market that has exploded in size over years of cheap borrowing rates. Alliance Bernstein gets around 3 million unique trading messages a day and it is vital to be able to aggregate that information, especially as volatility begins to increase, Switzer said.  “How do you have a trading desk ... of four guys with eight eyes that can look at 3 million messages and actually make any sense in rapidly changing and dynamic markets? That’s where we’re headed,” he said. ",1122018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-corpbonds-sec/blackrock-alliance-bernstein-tapping-more-into-electronic-bond-trading-idUSKBN1F02S7

1514,BLK,"Carillion collapse hits banks and investors, boosts short sellers","LONDON (Reuters) - Leading British lenders including Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group face the prospect of hundreds of millions of pounds in outstanding loans going unpaid from Carillion’s collapse on Monday.  Along with 10 other banks, they arranged a 790 million pound  ($1.1 billion) revolving credit facility for Carillion in 2015, which made up the bulk of 835 million pounds worth of syndicated bank loans owed by Carillion that mature in 2020. Last September, five banks agreed to an additional 140 million pounds in loans repayable at the end of 2018. In total, creditors to the UK support services and construction group, which was forced into liquidation on Monday, have around 1.6 billion pounds of debt exposure to the company. Many already started booking writedowns last year, as Carillion’s woes mounted following a profit warning in July.  Lloyds took a 270 million pound impairment charge at its third quarter results, up from 204 million pounds over the same period a year earlier. A source familiar with the matter said on Monday this was largely due to problems at Carillion.  These were also the main driver for a jump in provisions at Santander UK’s global corporate bank, another source said. They rose to 47 million pounds in the nine months to September 2017, up from 21 million pounds a year earlier.  The bank is likely to take a further hit at its annual results in February, the source said. At RBS’s commercial bank, provisions in the third quarter also spiked, growing from 20 million pounds in 2016 to 151 million pounds. At the time, Chief Executive Ross McEwan said this was down to a “single name”. The banks declined to comment on their exposure to Carillion. “I suspect that Lloyds and RBS could take a further writedown in Q4, and in addition to that the other lenders to Carillion are likely to take a writedown as well,” said John Cronin, head of UK banks research at analyst firm Goodbody said.  “The question is how material that is.” Asset managers with stakes in the company have also been among the casualties since Carillion’s crisis first became apparent last year. Scotland’s Kiltearn Partners, Canada’s Letko Brosseau and Associates and BlackRock - the world’s biggest asset manager - held large stakes in Carillion before a July 10 profit warning, which triggered a 39 percent plunge in its shares on the day. Back then Kiltearn was Carillion’s top investor with a 10 percent stake, according disclosures made to the stock market. BlackRock had a 7.6 percent shareholding and Letko owned 6.1 percent. All three have since cut down on their holdings.  A spokesman for Kiltearn said the investment firm did not hold any shares by the time Carillion was placed in liquidation, having already reduced it stake to 4.9 percent by December. BlackRock’s holding went below 5 percent - meaning it no longer had to disclose its stake - just days after the July warning, while Letko’s stake had been cut to 2.8 percent by November.   Among those who benefited from Carillion’s demise, hedge funds shorting its shares have however made paper profits of hundreds of millions of dollars over the last year. With a quarter of Carillion’s shares shorted at the beginning of July 2107 – a total value of around $270 million – short-sellers made around $190 million when its share price fell 70 percent over the course of three trading days following the July profit warning, according to Reuters calculations.  Many of the same funds made an additional $20 million when Carillion again warned on profits in November 2017, sending its shares down a further 48 percent in a single day.  The latest disclosures to Britain’s watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority show that BlackRock had a 1.95 percent short position on Carillion stock as of Jan. 11.  A spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment on its overall exposure to Carillion. Letko did not respond to an emailed request for comment.  Hedge funds Bodenholm Capital and Coltrane Asset Management, which both also disclosed bets against Carillion shares to the FCA, made 4 million pounds each from shorting the stock since the July warning, Reuters calculations show.  Short-sellers pay institutional shareholders a fee to borrow their shares, before selling these on into the market. In most cases the hedge fund hopes to buy these shares back at a lower price in the future, return them to the original shareholder and pocket the difference.  But if a company enters liquidation and its shares are eventually deemed worthless, the hedge fund does not have to return the stock.  “They will sit on people’s books for a while, the short-sellers will continue to pay a rental fee for a period of time to the original holder, but eventually they will be written off by both sides,” said David Lewis, an analyst covering short-selling at data provider Astec Analytics.  “The short-seller gets to keep the money they sold it for.” ($1 = 0.7251 pounds) ",1152018,http://www.reuters.com/article/carillion-restructuring-funds/carillion-collapse-hits-banks-and-investors-boosts-short-sellers-idUSL8N1PA3G4

1516,BLK,BlackRock sees opportunity to take on more market risk,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s Investment Institute said on Tuesday that the swoon in stock markets is “contained” and that it sees an opportunity to take on more risk, particularly in emerging market equities. The recent pullback “appeared to stem from investor jitters over the stock market run-up, record equity inflows and rapidly increasing interest rates,” exacerbated by products betting against rising U.S. equity volatility, BlackRock said. A real change in markets would require a deterioration in the economy, but BlackRock anticipates global growth to continue in 2018, the company’s Investment Institute said in a note. The group includes investors and strategists from around BlackRock, which manages $6 trillion in assets. Markets that had been calm roared to life in recent days, and on Tuesday indexes rebounded from the biggest one-day drops for the S&P; 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in more than six years that stalled the market’s record run. Still, BlackRock said the low-volatility era for markets may not be over. BlackRock’s strategists had expressed a “neutral” position in U.S. stocks before the selloff, and even their reaffirmed endorsement of equities over bonds on Tuesday included the caveat that they feel the best opportunities are outside the world’s largest economy, in emerging markets.

1518,BLK,BlackRock warns of risk as inverse volatility products sink,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, warned of the risk of so-called inverse Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) following Monday’s steep decline in financial instruments that bet against wild downward swings in the markets. Monday’s stock market rout left two of the most popular ETPs, which investors use to benefit from calm rather than volatile conditions, facing potential liquidation, market participants said. The VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN sank 84 percent in after-hours trading, while the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF fell nearly 79 percent as investors questioned if they could survive the volatility shock. The products seek to provide inverse exposure to VIX short-term futures and, when that measure spikes, the investment loses value, at which time ETP issuers could liquidate the shares. It was not immediately clear if the issuers would opt to liquidate these products. BlackRock did not mention the products by name, but reiterated its long-held view that inverse and “leveraged” ETPs that double or triple market returns “are not ETFs, and they don’t perform like ETFs under stress,” adding “that’s why iShares does not offer them.” IShares is the brand name for BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs). BlackRock also called for a regulatory classification system to label levered and inverse ETPs differently than plain-vanilla ETFs, to show the risks associated with such products. SVXY sponsor ProShare Capital Management LLC declined to comment. Janus Henderson Group plc, which markets the VelocityShares notes, could not be reached immediately. Credit Suisse Group AG, which issued the VelocityShares notes, traded down 6 percent after-hours. “The XIV ETN activity is reflective of today’s market volatility. There is no material impact to Credit Suisse,” said spokeswoman Nicole Sharp. She declined to comment further. Stocks plummeted in highly volatile trading on Monday, with the benchmark S&P; 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrials suffering their biggest respective percentage drops since August 2011 as a long-awaited pullback from record highs deepened.

1524,BLK,BlackRock plans to raise $10 billion for equity investments: source,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) plans to raise about $10 billion as part of a new business that would take direct stakes in companies, according to a person familiar with the matter. The move marks a new strategy for the company that manages more than $6 trillion for investors through publicly offered mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, many of which own broad swaths of the market.  A multibillion-dollar fund could put the world’s largest asset manager in more direct competition to own promising private companies with the likes of Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) Warren Buffett and private-equity firms, including Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), from which it was initially spun out.

The company’s plan to raise about $10 billion was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has long pushed corporate executives to adjust their behavior to focus on generating long-term value for shareholders, rather than simply meeting short-term profit targets. The person said the new effort is being chaired by Mark Wiseman, a top executive who the company hired in 2016 from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

1528,BLK,Drug company Innoviva settles with activist hedge fund Sarissa -sources,"(Reuters) - U.S. respiratory drug company Innoviva Inc has reached a settlement with activist hedge fund Sarissa Capital Management LP to replace its board of directors and remove the threat of a new proxy contest, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The settlement comes just two months after a Delaware judge handed Sarissa a legal victory by installing two of the fund’s nominees to Innoviva’s board of directors. Sarissa had sued Innoviva, accusing it of backing out last April of a settlement that Sarissa agreed to end its previous proxy contest. As part of the new settlement with Sarissa, Innoviva will accept three new independent directors to its board and dismiss five of its current directors at its next annual general meeting later this year, the three sources said. The resulting board will have five members, two of which will be Sarissa representatives, the sources added. The new board members will include Sarissa’s general counsel  Mark DiPaolo, media consultant Jules Haimovitz and immunologist Sarah Schlesinger, the sources said.  Innoviva will retain the board members added by Sarissa last year, namely investment banker George Bickerstaff and Sarissa Capital senior analyst Odysseas Kostas, they added.  The sources asked not to be identified ahead of any official announcement. Sarissa declined to comment, while Innoviva, which has a market capitalization of about $1.6 billion, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sarissa, which owns an approximately 3 percent stake in Innoviva, has accused the company of spending too much money on executive pay and board compensation, given that its only function is to manage the asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease drug royalties it receives from GlaxoSmithKline Plc. GlaxoSmithKline is Innoviva’s largest shareholder, with a 29.6 percent stake in the company. Sarissa now plans to push for changes on how Innoviva spends money and consider moves such as share buybacks and dividend hikes, according to the sources.  Sarissa has a track record of shaking up boards in the pharmaceutical industry. Its past targets have included Biogen Inc and Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc, a manufacturer of cancer drugs which sold itself to Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd last year for $5.2 billion.    In its first brush with Sarissa, Innoviva told the fund last April it agreed to settle a challenge to its board just hours before a shareholder vote, only to back out after it found out that BlackRock Inc, one of its top investors that was supportive of Sarissa, switched sides and sided with the company, according to court documents.  Delaware judge Joseph Slights ruled in December that Innoviva’s “opportunistic maneuvers” to get out of the agreement with Sarissa offended “basic notions of equity.”  ",2132018,http://www.reuters.com/article/innoviva-sarissa/drug-company-innoviva-settles-with-activist-hedge-fund-sarissa-sources-idUSL2N1Q20YO
1529,BLK,Long bonds a 'significant risk' as inflation revs: BlackRock's Rieder,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Long-dated bonds “represent a significant risk” as investors focus on signs inflation is rising, a top portfolio manager with BlackRock Inc said on Wednesday. There is a “strong case” for owning short-term U.S. bonds as inflation accelerates, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager. “It’s vital for investors to carefully consider where on the curve, and precisely how they’re taking duration risk today, given the extreme continued risk the back-end of the yield curve faces,” Rieder said in an emailed statement. Duration measures the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in interest rates. Rieder described inflation as “accelerating” following a U.S. Labor Department report that showed consumer prices rose more than expected in January. The U.S. Federal Reserve could deliver three or four interest rate hikes this year, Rieder said, as it works to head off pressures that could erode the value of the dollar.  The futures market is currently pricing in three increases in the federal funds rate this year. Rieder has long said the economy is in good shape and ready for more rate hikes even as the Fed fell short of its own inflation target in recent years. He has argued that economic statistics do not fully capture the fact that consumer prices are held in check by new technologies. Rieder had forecast three or more rate hikes at the beginning of 2017, at the time a minority viewpoint, and he was ultimately vindicated as the Fed raised rates three times last year.  On Wednesday, Rieder said he does not expect that stronger inflation will have “negative macroeconomic implications.” Investors are currently debating whether tax cuts and a bigger U.S. budget deficit will cause the economy to overheat and force the Fed to hike quickly, hurting markets. Institutional shares of Rieder’s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund were up 6/10ths percent this year, as of Tuesday, beating most of its peers, according to Thomson Reuters’ Lipper unit.

BlackRock Inc said it will speak with weapons  manufacturers and distributors “to understand their response” to the second-deadliest shooting at a public school in U.S. history, putting pressure on companies such as Sturm Ruger & Company Inc and American Outdoor Brands Corp.  BlackRock is the largest shareholder in both gunmakers and has more than $6 trillion in assets under management. It stopped short of saying it would divest its funds of gun companies, however.

The NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Gun control activists have campaigned in recent days for everything from banning semi-automatic guns like the one used in the Florida shooting to asking public pension funds to sell gun stocks. New Jersey legislators on Thursday said they plan to introduce bills to bar state pension funds from investing in gun manufacturers. BlackRock said it cannot sell shares of a company in an index, given its fiduciary responsibilities. Instead, “We focus on engaging with the company and understanding how they are responding to society’s expectations of them,” BlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney said in an email. Sweeney declined to give more specifics, such as what if any changes BlackRock might seek at weapons makers or at retailers that sell their products. But with so much money under management, BlackRock often has among the largest stakes in U.S. public companies, giving it much potential influence over their policies. It owns about 17 percent of the total shares of Sturm Ruger and has about 11 percent of American Outdoor Brands, for instance, according to U.S. regulatory filings. The shares are largely held in funds that track indexes, such as the $6 billion iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF. BlackRock and other large index fund managers carry clout partly through their proxy votes, such as for directors and on matters brought to a vote by shareholders.

1533,BLK,Fed in no rush to raise rates: BlackRock's Rieder,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is in no rush to hike rates, creating an opportunity for risk assets but posing a threat to long-term bonds, top BlackRock Inc portfolio manager Rick Rieder said on Tuesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday vowed to prevent the economy overheating while sticking with a plan to gradually raise interest rates. Testifying before a congressional committee, he acknowledged the economy has strengthened, a remark that prompted investors to increase bets on four rate increases in 2018. Rieder, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income, said in a note the Fed has done a “respectable job,” is not struggling to keep up with inflation and “doesn’t appear to be in a rush” to raise rates. That is good news for risk assets and investments with short maturities despite the 1.3 percent decline of the S&P; 500 index on Tuesday. But long-dated bonds are a different story, according to Rieder. The risk of long-term bonds to rising interest rates grew as the Fed pursued its unconventional quantitative easing policies, he said. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 6/32 in price on Tuesday to yield 3.1629 percent.  “The long-end of the curve could well have further downside from here,” said Rieder. “This segment of the market is particularly price-sensitive today, and thus particularly perilous.” BlackRock oversees more than $6 trillion in stocks, bonds and other assets, making it the world’s largest asset manager.

That is good news for risk assets and investments with short maturities despite the 1.3 percent decline of the S&P; 500 index on Tuesday. But long-dated bonds are a different story, according to Rieder. The risk of long-term bonds to rising interest rates grew as the Fed pursued its unconventional quantitative easing policies, he said. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 6/32 in price on Tuesday to yield 3.1629 percent.  “The long-end of the curve could well have further downside from here,” said Rieder. “This segment of the market is particularly price-sensitive today, and thus particularly perilous.” BlackRock oversees more than $6 trillion in stocks, bonds and other assets, making it the world’s largest asset manager.

1539,BLK,BlackRock poses tough questions to gunmakers and sellers,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock Inc said on Friday it is pressing gunmakers and weapons retailers in its portfolios to explain how they monitor firearm sales and use, and it is studying the creation of new index-based portfolios of stocks that would exclude gunmakers and retailers. The moves by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with more than $6 trillion under management, amount to the most detailed critical stance by a big financial firm after last month’s deadly high school shooting in Florida. “As it has for many people, the recent tragedy in Florida has driven home for BlackRock the terrible toll from gun violence in America. We believe that this event requires response and action from a wide range of entities across both the public and private sectors,” BlackRock said in a note to clients posted on its website. Were it to launch the new portfolios, the step in theory might reduce demand for industry stocks given the firm’s leading stakes in companies like American Outdoor Brands Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co.. Representatives for the companies have not responded to questions about shareholder pressure this week and did not immediately respond to inquiries on Friday. The financial sector has been under pressure from clients and safety activists to re-examine relations with the weapons industry after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead. In its client note, BlackRock said its questions to gunmakers would include whether they require retailers to certify they do background checks and whether they require distributors to disclose regulatory warnings. BlackRock also said it will ask gunmakers whether they monitor if their distributors and retailers “have a high volume of their guns identified as having been used in crimes.”  That could please gun-safety advocates like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which has argued a small share of gun shops deserve the title of “bad apples” for failing to control their inventory. For retailers, BlackRock said it is asking questions such as what strategies they use to prevent the potential misuse of guns, such as limits on bulk purchases. BlackRock is the top shareholder in American Outdoor and Sturm Ruger and is second-largest in a third weapons producer, Vista Outdoor Inc.  The three represent just 0.01 percent of total assets, BlackRock said, which could make it easy for the company to exclude them. A spokesman declined to offer more detail about what new index-based portfolios might look like. BlackRock’s investments in the gunmakers are held through passive products. BlackRock said it cannot sell securities held in such funds, leaving it with the responsibility to reach out to companies and, where necessary, to vote against directors or management. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink in recent years has emphasized the firm’s focus on social and governance issues, aimed at reducing portfolio risk. That stance, along with the company’s size has made it a focal point of gun-safety activists. BlackRock had previously said it would engage with weapons companies, as have other firms including State Street Corp and Bank of America, but they have not offered as much detail about their questions to the industry. Other big fund investors have not taken a public stance on gunmakers. Spokespeople for Vanguard Group and Fidelity have declined to discuss their engagement with specific companies.  A representative for American Funds parent Capital Group said via e-mail on Friday that the firm is “engaging with gun manufacturers to understand their plans to ensure the safe use of these products.” Big retailers this week put in place new restrictions, such as a decision by Dick’s Sporting Goods to halt the sale of assault-style rifles and to raise to 21 the minimum age to buy firearms.

1541,BLK,Breakingviews - BlackRock puts gun-complex boards in crosshairs," NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The world's largest fund manager has put those who make or sell America’s preferred weapon of mass murder in its crosshairs. On Friday BlackRock, which oversees more than $6 trillion, outlined steps to ensure the three publicly traded arms manufacturers in which it owns stock make ""a positive contribution to society."" It won't solve America's gun-violence epidemic, but by engaging with gunmakers and distributors rather than divesting, BlackRock provides a blueprint for how shareholders can bring about social change and safeguard their investments. The Feb. 14 massacre of 17 students and teachers at a Florida high school by a young man wielding a Smith & Wesson assault-style rifle galvanized consumers and companies like no previous gun-related tragedy – not Sandy Hook, not Las Vegas, not Orlando. The country’s largest retailers, airlines, rental-car outfits and hotel chains responded by changing their policies on firearms sales or cutting their affiliations with the National Rifle Association. But BlackRock is in a unique position, one of both clout and inflexibility. As the largest shareholder in the three publicly traded consumer-arms merchants, including Smith & Wesson parent American Outdoor Brands, it bears some complicity in providing capital to fund their operations, including the production of AR-15s. Yet because BlackRock’s customers own those shares through passive funds designed to mimic indexes, such as the Russell 2000 of small-cap companies, it can’t simply sell stock and walk away. After weeks of considering its role, which Breakingviews first highlighted the day after the shooting, Chief Executive Larry Fink has come up with a plan. BlackRock will pose more than a dozen questions on guns to manufacturers and distributors. These range from asking ""What steps do you take to support and promote gun safety education at the point of sale?"" to ""What steps do you take to support the safe and responsible use of your products?"" True, for the majority of Americans who in recent polls say they want enhanced gun-safety regulation, a strongly worded letter with some pointed questions may not sound like much. But look again at BlackRock’s note. The firm says that “another key aspect of investment stewardship is voting on specific proxy proposals and on the election of a company’s directors.” That’s finance-speak for: If these companies fail to respond, we will vote to fire their directors, a class that includes chief executives, when the annual meeting comes along. And that’s not an idle threat. Last year BlackRock, along with rival index-fund manager Vanguard, used this power to force Exxon Mobil’s board to report on what it was doing to combat climate change. Again, BlackRock is not curing gun violence. That’s a job for policymakers. But as legislators fail to act, it’s one small step in that direction.",3022018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-breakingviews/breakingviews-blackrock-puts-gun-complex-boards-in-crosshairs-idUSKCN1GE2I8

The sovereign funds include Singapore’s Temasek [TEM.UL] and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the person said. Deutsche Bank is finalizing plans for the IPO of the asset management business, known as DWS, that have been a year in the making. Deutsche is expected to sell 25 percent of existing DWS shares for 1.5-2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.5 billion), people close to the matter have said.   DWS is seeking anchor investors, the person said, while it also wants to ensure the liquidity for the free floating shares. Deutsche Bank’s largest investors, the Qatari royal family and the Chinese conglomerate HNA [HNAIRC.UL], are not expected to invest in the IPO, said the person, who disclosed the potential investor base on condition of anonymity because the IPO process is ongoing.  Spokesmen for Qatar and HNA declined to comment. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment, while the potential DWS investors declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. The DWS listing will mark the most tangible milestone yet in Chief Executive Officer John Cryan’s struggle to restructure the flagship German bank.

Some investors have raised questions about the timing of the IPO as the economic growth cycle turns and financial markets become more volatile. “One of the key investor concerns regarding DWS is the question whether the asset management industry in general is at the top of the cycle,” said a second person close to the IPO. The asset management industry is facing pressure on fees and rising regulatory costs, which show no signs of abating and which could limit profits for the sector.  “Asset management is under pressure from regulators, investors and the public to perform better and charge less,” said Tom Brown, Global Head of Asset Management at consultants KPMG. “Firms need scale or to specialize to stay in the game.”  These potential constraints come on top of issues specific to Deutsche Bank. “Will DWS be able to cut costs as harshly as needed?” the second person close to the IPO said. “Will it be able to do an interesting large M&A; deal given the fact that DB wants to retain control?” Another concern among investors is that Deutsche Bank could dilute the price of DWS shares by selling down its stake if the bank needs to raise capital.  The IPO would help Deutsche to bolster its balance sheet and quell shareholder unrest over the pace of its turnaround after three consecutive years of losses. It could also possibly open the way to dividend payouts. A price range for the shares is expected to be announced as soon as Sunday, followed by the publication of an investor prospectus on Monday. The IPO would likely take place in the week of March 19, sources have said, adding it had been brought forward hoping to lock in stock market valuations ahead of any correction.

1549,BLK,Gun maker American Outdoor defends safety efforts in letter to BlackRock,"(Reuters) - The top executives of gun maker American Outdoor Brands Corp on Tuesday defended their safety efforts in a letter to asset manager BlackRock Inc posted on the website of the maker of Smith & Wesson guns. American Outdoor Brands and other gun makers have been under pressure from investors including BlackRock for a response after a high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, last month that killed 17 people. In the letter, American Outdoor Brands’ chairman and chief executive officer said public safety priorities should be to enforce existing laws, improve background checks and address mental health challenges. “The solution is not to take a politically motivated action that has an adverse impact on our company, our employees, our industry, our shareholders, the economies we support and, significantly, the rights of our law abiding customers, but results in no increase in public safety,” stated the letter. It is signed by company Chairman Barry Monheit and CEO James Debney. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, on Friday said it would press gun makers and weapons retailers in its portfolios to explain how they monitor firearms sales and use, and said it was studying the creation of new index-based portfolios of stocks that would exclude gun makers and retailers. A BlackRock spokesman on Tuesday said in an e-mail that the firm will continue to engage with firearms makers “to further understand their business policies and practices in order to protect our clients’ investments in them.”  Other companies and financial firms have also been reviewing ties with the weapons industry and the National Rifle Association in the wake of the shooting, amid calls by some groups for investors to go further and divest the stocks altogether.  The letter from American Outdoor Brands, and an accompanying eight-page company memo, amount to one of the industry’s first detailed defenses of its practices and may guide a debate over what specific changes investors might seek. American Outdoor said its distributors face restrictions on who they may sell firearms to, and said it works closely with law enforcement agencies to trace guns used in crimes. “We believe it is important to tell you that we respect the national debate that is currently underway regarding firearms and safety,” Monheit and Debney wrote.

1556,BLK,UPDATE 1-Kroger's Fred Meyer plans to phase out firearms business,"(Reuters) - Kroger Co’s (KR.N) superstore chain Fred Meyer said it would exit its firearms business, two weeks after deciding to stop selling guns and ammunition to those under the age of 21.  Earlier this month, Kroger joined other U.S. retailers such as Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc (DKS.N) to bar the sale of firearms to those under 21, following a deadly shooting at a Florida high school. Fred Meyer said it was working on plans to phase out sales of firearms and ammunition.  “This is a victory for communities and for common sense. And it’s a positive step for our pension fund beneficiaries and for public safety,” New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city’s public pension funds, said in a statement. Stringer said he had called for Kroger to cease selling firearms last year. Several large money management firms that own shares in gun makers, including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, and State Street Corp (STT.N), have felt the heat following the Florida massacre and have sought answers from gun makers and distributors. Fred Meyer said the firearm business generated about $7 million annually, while it also highlighted “softening consumer demand.”  Fred Meyer operates 133 stores in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington and sells firearms in 43 of them.

1560,BLK,"BlackRock to offer gun-free investment strategies, ETFs","BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, said on Thursday it will offer new investment strategies and exchange-traded funds that exclude civilian firearms producers and retailers, following through on plans it outlined last month after a Florida high school massacre. According to a client update sent by a company spokesman, BlackRock will offer a new line of firearm-free products to big institutional investors and pension plans that track broad market indexes like the S&P; 500 and Russell 1000. BlackRock also said it would create two new ETFs that would exclude gun makers and large gun retailers, and add similar screens to existing stock and bond ETFs that already consider social factors. The changes would bounce retailers from some current ETFs including Walmart Inc and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. Strong investor interest in the products in theory could weaken demand for shares of gun makers such as American Outdoor Brands Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co, where BlackRock funds have large stakes, although it could take awhile for clients to move enough money to make an impact. BlackRock’s action is the latest instance of a business responding to a backlash among many Americans against firearms companies following a series of U.S. mass shootings, although the eventual impact of the company moves remains unclear. BlackRock has about $6 trillion under management. The firm and rivals have struggled to balance social and environmental issues important to clients with their need to own stocks represented in big worldwide indexes. BlackRock did not make executives available for interviews including CEO Larry Fink, and did not offer more details about talks it has sought with companies involved with firearms. The gunmakers have defended their safety efforts. Other firms already offer ETFs with at least some restrictions on gun-related stocks including the Global X S&P; 500 Catholic Values ETF. Still, given the firm’s size, BlackRock’s new products could  prove a significant step as financial firms face pressure to impose limits tighter than current laws act in the wake of the February shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 people dead and renewed a national gun control debate. On March 22, Citigroup Inc added restrictions on firearms sales for retail clients.

The ETFs getting the new screens have had little exposure to firearms makers, BlackRock said, and already consider social factors in their stockpicking such as the iShares MSCI USA ESG Optimized ETF.

1565,BLK,Fund industry defends bond ETFs to U.S. regulators,"(Reuters) - A fund industry trade group representative on Monday disputed the idea that bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might fail to hold up under stress, telling U.S. securities regulators he knows of no convincing evidence to suggest such funds’ liquidity is a problem. The remarks by Investment Company Institute Chief Economist Sean Collins come as some top investors question the resiliency of debt funds, which are often cheap to trade but hold corporate bonds that are difficult to buy and sell, even in normal markets. Allianz SE chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian, for instance, had told an ETF industry conference in January that some of the funds inadvertently over-promise liquidity - the ability to buy or sell without a significant impact on price - to investors who may not have that experience when market sentiment deteriorates. (Pacific Investment Management Co, an Allianz subsidiary, manages bond ETFs.) Debate on whether such a “liquidity mismatch” exists, while not new, has drawn the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and an advisory committee to the agency, known as the Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee, which convened a panel of traders and investors to discuss the topic. The working group advising the SEC on bond ETFs is chaired by an employee of BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest manager of such funds. ETFs hold stocks, bonds and other assets. Only large institutions can redeem them directly with issuers. Other investors trade them on exchanges. Because much of the trading activity involves shares of the funds, rather than individual bonds, ETF issuers from BlackRock to State Street Corp have said they offer investors a new way to transact, improving liquidity. More than $1 billion changes hands daily on exchanges using the largest “junk” bond ETF, BlackRock’s $15 billion iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF. “ETFs are adding to price discovery,” said Collins, noting that ETFs can meet the redemption orders they do get without raising cash, simply by handing over bonds held by the fund. “Investors should understand they own a share of an asset that might be very liquid or it might be less liquid,” said Matt Berger, global head of fixed income and commodities at Jane Street Group LLC, a high-frequency trader and major ETF market maker. “Investors should just understand what they’re buying.” Earlier, the committee also recommended that the SEC mandate an experiment to study whether the more timely inclusion of some large corporate bond trades to the public data feed would lead to increased liquidity and make it easier to get such trades done.  The one-year pilot program would increase the threshold on the sizes of both investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond trades that must be disseminated to the public within 48 hours of a trade occurring. This would give market makers a better view into what is trading in the market and the risk they are taking on, potentially enabling them to provide more liquidity.

1566,BLK,"BlackRock snags more assets in market rout, boosts profit","NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, generated higher profit during the first quarter by luring more money from investors even as stock and bond markets fell.     Fund manager profits typically decline during market routs because their fees are based on the value of customer assets.  But BlackRock benefited from its large footprint in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have been taking market share away from pricier investment products for several years.     BlackRock attracted nearly $57 billion in new cash from clients in the latest quarter. Its iShares ETFs unit was the biggest contributor, drawing $35 billion in net inflows.     “It’s better to be BlackRock in this atmosphere,” BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink said in an interview.  “We have always differentiated ourselves in more volatile times.”     Markets swung wildly during the first three months of the year as early enthusiasm over U.S. corporate tax cuts was soon blunted by concerns about inflation, the risk of a global trade war and Federal Reserve policy.     Even so, BlackRock’s assets under management climbed to $6.32 trillion as of March 31, up from $5.42 trillion a year earlier.     In addition to customer inflows, BlackRock benefited from favorable currency movements, lower taxes and ensuring expenses rose less than revenue.     The New York-based company’s net income rose to $1.09 billion, or $6.68 per share, in the first quarter, up 28 percent from the year-ago period.     Adjusted for special items, BlackRock earned $6.70 per share, beating the $6.39 per share analysts expected, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Its shares closed 1.5 percent higher at $533.01. BlackRock shares are up nearly 40 percent in price terms over the past year, compared to an 18.5 percent rise for a Thomson Reuters index that includes more than a dozen of its U.S. rivals.  The results suggest BlackRock is continuing to evolve from a traditional fund manager into a steadier financial operation whose profits are not based exclusively on market movements, said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders.      Technology has played a key role in that shift, helping to lure new assets by improving investment performance and automating routine functions, he said.     “I’m viewing this more as a technology firm than a traditional asset manager,” said Sanders.     BlackRock has a technology business that licenses its internal operating system to clients and competitors. Though it is among BlackRock’s smaller business lines, Fink said he expects its revenue to grow at mid-teen percentages in the coming years.     Earlier this year, the company opened an artificial intelligence laboratory in California’s Silicon Valley and added Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) executive Peggy Johnson to its board of directors.

1571,BLK,BlackRock hiked CEO Larry Fink's pay by 9 percent in 2017: filing,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, raised total compensation for chairman and chief executive officer Larry Fink by 8.9 percent in 2017, according to a filing on Friday. Fink was awarded $27.7 million in compensation last year, compared to $25.5 million in 2016, based on a calculation of his pay in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. But BlackRock said it raised Fink’s pay for the year by 9.6 percent to $27.9 million, according to a set of calculations it prefers. The figures differ because BlackRock reports some incentive pay in a different year. The company’s president, Rob Kapito, was paid nearly $22 million, according to figures based on regulatory guidelines. Kapito and Fink were among BlackRock’s founders in 1988. BlackRock also rolled out in late 2017 multi-million-dollar stock options to a small group of Fink’s and Kapito’s deputies to keep them on board and for succession planning. Grants were made to Rob Goldstein, Mark McCombe and Gary Shedlin, according to the filing. Each are tipped as possible successors to Fink. BlackRock’s stock gained 35 percent in price terms during 2017, hitting $500 a share for the first time. That compares to a 26 percent rise for a Thomson Reuters index .TRXFLDUSPINVM that includes more than a dozen of its industry rivals in the United States. New York-based BlackRock’s net income grew by nearly 58 percent in 2017 to $5 billion while the assets overseen by the company topped $6 trillion, an industry record and 22 percent gain over the year prior. In its most recent quarter, BlackRock, which manages the iShares-brand exchange-traded funds, generated higher profit by luring more money from investors even as stock and bond markets stumbled. Fink is often quoted for his views on markets and corporate governance and has been listed among the world’s best CEOs by the newspaper Barron’s. His pay is among the richest among U.S. financial firms, according to Thomson Reuters data covering listed corporations, and the company’s pay to executive officers has drawn criticism from proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co LLC. JPMorgan Chase & Co chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon earned $28.3 million in 2017, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s (GS.N) Lloyd Blankfein was paid $22 million. Top hedge fund and private-equity managers often take home far more. In its own analysis, BlackRock board’s compensation committee credited Fink’s leadership with helping the company develop new business and grow profits.

1572,BLK,"UPDATE 4-PNC forecasts modest loan growth in Q2, shares fall","(Reuters) - U.S. regional lender PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) on Friday forecast modest loan growth and a rise in loan loss provision for the second quarter, sending its shares down more than 4 percent. After PNC reported first-quarter profit broadly in line with analysts’ estimates, the guidance by Chief Financial Officer Robert Rilley pushed shares to a more than three-month low.  The broader market and the S&P; 500 financial sector index .SPSY were both lower, weighed down by quarterly results from JPMorgan Chase Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N). Chief Executive Bill Demchak said on a post-earnings call he expects real estate markets to tighten, leading to slower loan growth in the business. “The combination of rising business optimism and lower corporate tax rates has raised the bar in terms of loan growth expectations,” Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sander said. PNC Financial forecast second-quarter provision for loan losses to be between $100 million and $150 million. This follows a 4.5 percent rise in loan loss provision to $92 million in the first quarter. The higher provision and a 5 percent jump in expenses offset gains from higher interest income and pushed PNC Financial to report an in-line profit for the three months ended March 31.  The Pittsburgh-based bank, among the United States’ largest local lenders by assets, had beaten analysts’ profit estimates for the past seven quarters.     The company reported earnings per share of $2.43, in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. PNC Financial, which owns a minority stake in BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), said its loan portfolio grew 4 percent in the first quarter, with commercial lending expanding 6 percent. Net interest income rose 9 percent to $2.37 billion. ",4132018,http://www.reuters.com/article/pnc-finl-svc-results/update-4-pnc-forecasts-modest-loan-growth-in-q2-shares-fall-idUSL3N1RQ4J1

1575,BLK,Activist investor Jana hired staff for new socially responsible fund,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jana Partners LLC, the activist investment firm now taking steps into socially responsible investing, has hired a portfolio manager and analyst to help oversee its effort of pushing companies to become better corporate citizens. Dan Hanson, who for a time managed socially responsible funds at BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager, and Pulkit Agarwal, who worked at the International Finance Corporation in India before moving to the United States, were hired recently by the New York-based hedge fund, people familiar with the moves said. They will be working on Jana’s new portfolio for which the firm is currently raising money. Hanson will be a co-portfolio manager and share the responsibilities of overseeing the new fund with Charles Penner, a long-time partner at Jana. Agarwal will support them in helping generate ideas for the new fund, which is expected to be called Jana Impact Capital. Jana, which oversees roughly $4 billion, in January teamed up with the California State Teachers Retirement System, or Calstrs, which controls roughly $2 billion of Apple Inc shares, to urge the iPhone maker to develop new tools to help parent limit children’s time on mobile devices. For Jana, it was its forceful foray into pushing for social issues after it has long been successful in prodding corporations to improve their governance. The new fund will look to target other companies on issues like climate change or wage inequality and will likely target as many as 10 companies, people familiar with Jana’s plans said. Jana’s new fund is being raised at a time more investors are showing an interest in so-called ESG portfolios which make investment selections by including environmental, social and governance factors. Pairing Penner, a trained lawyer who has worked on most of Jana’s past activist campaigns, and Hanson, a recognized expert in the socially-responsible investing space and investor, will give Jana new tools to identify appropriate targets, industry analysts said. Before joining Jana, Hanson had been co-chair of the Investment Strategy Committee at Jarislowsky Fraser Global Investment Management, and before that he spent a decade at BlackRock where he was the sole manager of the BlackRock Socially Responsible Equity portfolio.

1577,BLK,BlackRock wants regulators to address unequal voting rights,"BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) on Thursday called on securities regulators to set international standards for shareholder voting rights, suggesting they resolve one of the thorniest debates in corporate governance. The world’s largest asset manager made the call in a letter to index provider MSCI, which had sought comments about a proposal it is considering to adjust the index weighting of stocks like Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to account for their unequal voting structures. BlackRock, which manages $6.3 trillion, said while it appreciates the index provider’s attention to the issues, MSCI’s proposed changes could distort markets. Instead, “we believe that policymakers, not index providers, should set corporate governance standards,” it stated in the letter, signed by BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick and posted on the firm’s website.  Since last year a number of high-profile technology firms, including Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N), Dropbox Inc (DBX.O) and Snap Inc (SNAP.N), have listed shares with a voting structure that gives lopsided decision-making power to insiders. According to the Council of Institutional Investors, among 124 IPOs in 2017, 23 had unequal voting rights, although some would give outside investors more voting power over time. Corporate executives say the structures help their firms focus on long-term growth.  BlackRock and rivals like State Street Corp (STT.N) and Vanguard Group have criticized the trend but have bought the shares to fill index funds they say must try to replicate mandated market segments. MSCI and other providers last year made changes that excluded some stocks with unequal rights, like Snap, from widely followed indexes, including the S&P; 500 and the Russell 1000. MSCI said in January it might make further changes after more  consultation with clients. BlackRock’s Novick wrote that a global body like the International Organization of Securities Commissions would be well-positioned to suggest listing standards that national regulators could use. A Madrid-based spokeswoman for the organization said it has not undertaken work on the matter. U.S. regulations are still under development. A committee that advises the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March recommended reforms like clear disclosures of different voting rights and of the risks that could result.

1585,BLK,Subsea 7 makes $2 billion hostile bid to break up McDermott's U.S. deal,"OSLO (Reuters) - Offshore oil services firm Subsea 7 (SUBC.OL) has made an unsolicited offer worth about $2 billion for U.S. rival McDermott (MDR.N), potentially breaking up the U.S. company’s agreed deal with onshore engineering firm Chicago Bridge & Iron (CB&I;) CBI.N. The deal could make Oslo-listed Subsea 7 the market leader in supplying and installing subsea equipment for oil and gas firms with a combined market share of 24 percent, followed by TechnipFMC with 20 percent and Saipem with 15 percent, an Oslo-based consultancy, Rystad Energy, said. The flurry of M&A; activity comes as oil prices have risen to more than $70 a barrel, lifting the need for offshore services and the appetite for offshore investments. It follows a tough period when the oil services industry was hit by a fall in oil prices and spending cuts by major oil companies. Subsea 7 said combining the two companies would make them better equipped to handle large offshore engineering contracts for the oil industry. Jean Cahuzac, chief executive of Subsea 7, said the potential deal could provide growth opportunities in the Middle East where McDermott has a strong position. Subsea 7 has offered McDermott $7 per share, either in cash or up to 50 percent in stock, representing a premium of 16 percent over McDermott’s closing share price on Friday of $6.05. Subsea said McDermott’s board had rejected its proposal on April 20 but also said it could raise its offer if the U.S. company agreed to talks. McDermott said in a separate statement its board had concluded that Subsea 7’s proposal “significantly undervalued” the company and was not an attractive alternative to the proposed combination with CB&I.;  McDermott’s shares were up by around 13.2 percent, while CB&I; shares were down around 12 percent by 1555 GMT. Subsea 7 shares closed up 0.8 percent. Offshore-focused McDermott announced last December it would buy onshore-based CB&I; in an all-stock deal worth $1.86 billion to create an integrated construction and engineering services provider. Shareholders of McDermott and CB&I; are set to vote on May 2 on whether to approve McDermott’s offer for CB&I.; Subsea 7 said its bid proposal was subject to the termination of McDermott’s deal with CB&I.; If that deal falls through, McDermott might have to pay a $60 million termination fee, the company has said.  Two proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC have recommended that CB&I; shareholders vote for the McDermott offer.  Some of McDermott’s shareholders, however, have opposed the deal, citing CB&I;’s latest performance. BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, is the top shareholder in McDermott with a 12 percent stake.  “It’s a very well played offer from Subsea 7. Timing wise, it gives enough time for McDermott management to consider alternatives before the May 2 vote,” Carnegie analyst Frederik Lunde said. Subsea 7’s biggest shareholder and chairman, Norwegian billionaire Kristian Siem, has long called for the industry to consolidate as a means to cope with cost-cutting by oil companies. Siem said on Monday the company had decided to make the offer for McDermott after some of the U.S. company’s shareholders and one board member voiced opposition to the proposal to buy CB&I.; Cahuzac said on Monday the company could revise its offer if McDermott’s board decides to start talks and provides more information about its business. Subsea 7 said combining the two companies would help them to handle large offshore engineering contracts for the oil industry, known as EPCI projects, with Subsea 7’s strengths in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea complementing McDermott’s strengths in the Middle East, India and Australia. “Geographically speaking, Subsea 7 and McDermott are a perfect match,” Rystad Energy’s Audun Martinsen said. The Middle East and Asia regions represents more than 90 percent of McDermott’s upstream revenues, Rystad Energy said.  “The train is about to leave the station. McDermott is the only acquisition target that could make Subsea 7 the market leader in the SURF (subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines) sector,” Martinsen said.

1587,BLK,MOVES-BlackRock hires private equity specialists from Goldman Sachs,"April 30 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Monday it is hiring two specialists from Goldman Sachs Group Inc to bolster its private equity business in New York, according to a staff memo. Steve Lessar and Konnin Tam will join the world’s largest asset management company from Goldman Sachs this summer, according to the document, which was seen by Reuters. Each will be responsible for expanding BlackRock’s role within a business that effectively enables investors in private companies and funds that invest in such firms to resell their stakes to other institutions. Normally, that money is locked up for years. This market for “secondary” private capital saw a record $58 billion in transaction activity in 2017, according to investment bank Greenhill & Co Inc, with money chasing better returns than exist within public markets. “Our plan is to place Steve and Konnin at the core of a team that will expand our existing offerings and make BAI the leader in this business,” said the memo, using the acronym for BlackRock Alternative Investors, a group that oversees largely private investments ranging from real estate to hedge funds. BlackRock is known for more widely offered funds that invest in publicly traded stocks and bonds. Yet Chief Executive Larry Fink has made it a priority to compete in private markets, too, against Goldman Sachs and other rivals better known for those sorts of investments, such as Blackstone Group LP. BlackRock was spun off from Blackstone more than two decades ago. Fink told Wall Street analysts earlier this month that he expects so-called illiquid alternative investments, which include private equity and typically come with higher fees than its other funds, to “be one of the more significant” drivers for BlackRock’s business over the next few years. Alternatives represent a fraction of BlackRock’s assets under management, growing at a slower rate than its other businesses, yet they account for outsized fee revenue.

1588,BLK,"RPT-WRAPUP 3-Buffett craves more Apple shares, endorses its buybacks","(Repeats with no changes) * Buffett says Apple’s buybacks make sense * U.S., China see benefits of trade, billionaire says * “Oracle of Omaha” defends Wells Fargo’s leadership By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jonathan Stempel OMAHA, Neb., May 5 (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett has been buying a boatload of Apple Inc shares and on Saturday suggested he would buy even more shares at the right price. At Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s annual shareholder meeting, Buffett credited Apple with developing “extremely sticky” products to which consumers become attached and endorsed Apple’s decision to buy back its own stock, saying it was the technology company’s most productive use of cash. “We would love to see Apple go down in price,” Buffett said. Berkshire is now Apple’s third largest shareholder, behind Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc. “I’m delighted to see them repurchasing shares,” Buffett said, just two days after he revealed having bought 75 million additional Apple shares, and four days after Apple said it may repurchase $100 billion of stock. At the end of 2017, Berkshire had owned 165.3 million shares. “I love the idea of having our 5 percent, or whatever it is, maybe grow to 6 or 7 percent without our laying out a dime.” And Buffett described it as a mistake that he never thought Alphabet Inc’s Google and Amazon.com Inc made sense as investments for Berkshire. Buffett, 87, and his longtime partner and fellow billionaire Charlie Munger, 94, also took pointed questions on China, Wells Fargo & Co, guns, healthcare and their investment choices from shareholders, journalists and analysts at the more-than-six-hour meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The questions also elicited views on politics from the “Oracle of Omaha” and Munger. Buffett said it was unlikely that the United States and China would come to loggerheads on trade and believed the countries would avoid doing “something extremely foolish.” “The United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long time,” Buffett said, and that any tensions should not jeopardize the win-win benefits from trade. “It is just too big and too obvious ... that the benefits are huge and the world is dependent on it in a major way for its progress, that two intelligent countries (would) do something extremely foolish,” he said. “We both may do things that are mildly foolish from time to time.” The Trump administration has drawn a hard line in trade talks with Beijing, demanding a $200 billion cut in the Chinese trade surplus with the United States, sharply lower tariffs and advanced technology subsidies, people familiar with the talks said on Friday. Buffett suggested U.S. President Donald Trump should be an “educator-in-chief” on the invisible benefits of trade. Munger, meanwhile, answered a question on steel tariffs imposed by the White House by acknowledging that U.S. producers are hurting. “Even Donald Trump can be right on some of this stuff,” he said. Asked why Buffett was willing to do business with gun makers, he retorted, “I do not believe in imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.” The billionaire investor said U.S. corporate tax cuts were good for shareholders but cautioned that the long-term effects of economic choices could be hard to gauge. And Buffett predicted “bad endings” for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, and said long-term U.S. government bonds were a terrible investment because inflation would consume their returns. Buffett defended Wells Fargo and its chief executive, Tim Sloan, when asked when Berkshire would ditch the bank, one of its largest common stock holdings. Many shareholders applauded the question. Buffett said the bank had committed the “cardinal sin” of incentivizing employees into “kind of crazy conduct.” U.S. regulators imposed $1 billion of fines last month over lending abuses. But he maintained that the bank was not “inferior,” as an investment or morally, to its main rivals. Berkshire owned $25.2 billion of Wells Fargo stock as of March 31, down 14 percent from year end as a series of scandals weighed on the bank’s reputation. Wells Fargo investors last week gave strong backing to the bank’s directors and executives on Tuesday, indicating confidence in its overhauled leadership to rebound. Buffett addressed his alliance with another banker, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Jamie Dimon, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to tackle healthcare. Buffett said U.S. healthcare costs are a tapeworm on the economy, and he said the venture partners expect to name a chief executive within a couple months. Buffett faces a challenge investing Berkshire’s more than $108 billion of cash and equivalents, including for acquisitions, saying his “phone is not ringing off the hook with good deals.” Shortly before the meeting, Berkshire ended its more than year-long stretch of falling operating profit, while a new accounting rule caused the conglomerate chaired by Warren Buffett to suffer an overall net loss. Buffett said the net results were not representative of the business. The accounting change required Berkshire to report unrealized losses in its equity portfolio, which totaled $170.5 billion at year end, regardless of whether it planned to sell those stocks. Berkshire’s net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with profit of $4.06 billion a year earlier. But operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, rose 49 percent to a record $5.29 billion, or about $3,215 per Class A share, higher than the $3,116 per share analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shareholders have been enthusiastic about Berkshire, which sent out slightly more tickets to this year’s extravaganza than in 2015, when an estimated 42,000 celebrated Buffett’s 50th year at the helm. An even larger audience likely watched online via Yahoo Finance. Outside the convention center, Berkshire shareholders lined up for prime seats in the middle of the night. William Robertson, a Scotland native who fights fires and does forestry work in Switzerland, said he lined up at 11:30 p.m. Friday, 7-1/2 hours before doors opened. This year’s meeting is his third. “It gets me first place in the queue, I think when people go to so much effort it shows Warren how important he is for us,” Robertson said.

1593,BLK,Mexican leftist candidate has 'affable' meeting with BlackRock's Fink,"NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s presidential front-runner met BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink on Monday, part of a push by the left-wing politician to reassure investors about his policies ahead of the July vote, and his team said the men clicked personally. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is ahead by double digits in most major polls, has been openly fighting with some Mexican business leaders, and said he would review major energy contracts and a $13 billion airport project.  His campaign has met with multiple foreign fund managers in recent months to try and calm concerns about his policies, with aides telling investors that he is not opposed to foreign investment and markets. “They asked to speak with us and I accepted so we could get to know each other,” Lopez Obrador said in a local TV interview later on Monday.  He said that he told Fink that he would uphold the rule of law and fight corruption, and not expropriate private property. “They have lots of information ... they’re intelligent,” Lopez Obrador added.  BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is heavily invested in Mexico and in November announced it would acquire the  local asset management business of a Citigroup Inc subsidiary. Fink met Lopez Obrador on Monday morning in Mexico City, the candidate’s adviser Carlos Urzua said, praising Fink’s understanding of the country. “It was a very affable meeting. ... There was an immediate click between them. They both left the meeting charmed,” said Urzua, who is Lopez Obrador’s pick for finance minister. BlackRock declined to comment on the content of the encounter.     The meeting follows a change in tone from Lopez Obrador in recent days after a series of clashes with business leaders over what he calls influence trafficking. On Monday, he said a private concession could salvage the $13 billion airport project he has previously threatened to scrap. Markets have not reacted strongly to Lopez Obrador’s lead in the polls. The peso has weakened more than 7 percent against the dollar since mid-April, but the fall is mostly in line with other emerging market currencies. Fund managers and companies warn the next few months could be more volatile, partly on concerns over Lopez Obrador’s economic policy. BlackRock, which has $6.3 trillion in assets under management, engages with governments “irrespective of party affiliations,” the company said in a statement. Fink was a vocal supporter of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s economic reforms. Fink was due to meet with the management of clients, business partners and three other presidential campaigns -  those of second-placed Ricardo Anaya, ruling party candidate Jose Antonio Meade and independent Margarita Zavala. The Anaya campaign confirmed they had met. A spokesman for Zavala said she was due to meet Fink on Monday afternoon. The campaign for Meade, who was finance minister before he became the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), said the two met for about half an hour in the afternoon. Describing the talks as “great” and “cordial”, Vanessa Rubio, a senior Meade campaign official, noted the two had known each other for years and that relations were “very close” with BlackRock while the PRI candidate was finance minister.  According to a recent poll, less than two months before Mexicans vote, Lopez Obrador’s support grew to 39 percent from 38 percent in the previous poll at the end of March, but his lead narrowed to 14 points from 18. Fink has been consistently optimistic about the country’s prospects. In 2014, he said if he was starting his career, he might try his luck in Mexico. In recent years, BlackRock took a $900 million stake in the second phase of the Los Ramones pipeline project with private equity firm First Reserve. Marco Antonio Slim, a son of the country’s richest man, Carlos Slim, is a BlackRock board member.
