1,MET,U.S. House Democrat questions BofA settlement," * Rep. Miller presses FHFA on BofA settlement   * Says taxpayers on hook through Fannie, Freddie   * Says settlement is indirect subsidy to bank industry   WASHINGTON, July 11 (Reuters) - A U.S. House Democrat said on Monday he is concerned taxpayers may be partially on the hook as a result of Bank of America’s $8.5 billion settlement with bondholders over soured residential mortgage-backed securities.   Taxpayer-financed mortgage giants Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB “have substantial investments in the RMBS subject to the proposed settlement and have already suffered substantial losses” on those securities, Representative Brad Miller wrote to the Federal Housing Finance Agency.   Miller questioned whether the regulator has plans to limit the losses at Fannie and Freddie and urged FHFA to “zealously pursue all available legal claims” to protect taxpayers.   Bank of America agreed last month to pay $8.5 billion to investors who lost money on the distressed securities that were assumed once the lender acquired Countrywide Financial Corp.   Miller said FHFA should look into the proposed settlement due to the high stakes Fannie and Freddie have in the residential mortgage market, and the regulator should resolve whether or not there is any liability for the two firms if the settlement value is too low.   The settlement is with 22 institutional investors including BlackRock Inc (BKT.N), MetLife Inc (MET.N), Allianz SE’s (ALVG.DE) Pacific Investment Management Co and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   Miller said he is concerned that the settlement, which still needs court approval, provided “an indirect subsidy to the banking industry.” He pressed FHFA to issue subpoenas in order to find out if investors, including Fannie and Freddie, were misled on the value of RMBS losses tied to the Countrywide loans.  The government-run firms have been given more than $135 billion in federal support since they were placed in conservatorship in September 2008.   The bundling of risky home loans into securities fueled the U.S. housing slump, and mounting defaults hindered major Wall Street institutions during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

2,MET,New York probes Bank of America $8.5 billion mortgage pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York’s attorney general is investigating Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) $8.5 billion settlement with investors over losses in mortgage-backed securities, and has sought data from 20 institutional investors that agreed to the accord.  In letters to the firms, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman requested the names of various clients — including pension funds, government authorities and charities affiliated with the state — that invested in securities issued by the 530 mortgage securitization trusts covered in the accord. He also sought the par and current market values of the clients’ securities.  The letters are dated July 7, and were sent in connection with the attorney general’s “ongoing investigation” into the securitization of residential mortgages. Schneiderman requested that the information be provided by July 14.  Among the investors were BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), MetLife Inc (MET.N) and Allianz SE’s (ALVG.DE) Pacific Investment Management Co. Of the 22 investors that agreed to the accord, only the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Banks were not sent letters by Schneiderman.

Pimco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Reuters obtained copies of the letters on Tuesday.  Various attorneys general are scrutinizing the causes of and fallout from excess in mortgage securitizations, a key driver of the recent housing and financial crises.  Regulators including all 50 state attorneys general are also working on an expected multi-billion dollar settlement with large mortgage servicers over foreclosure practices.  The $8.5 billion settlement announced June 29 was part of roughly $20 billion of charges that Bank of America hopes will resolve much of its legal liability from its 2008 purchase of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp.  But the accord has drawn challenges from some Countrywide mortgage securities investors who question whether the accord is fair, or may provide some investors with windfalls.  The settlement requires approval by New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan.  In court filings this week, the institutional investors rejected various criticisms by a group of pension funds and 11 companies sharing the name Walnut Place, which own Countrywide securities in some trusts covered by the accord.  The institutional investors called “ludicrous” a claim that they engineered a gentle settlement to help Bank of America, which many of them regularly do business with in other areas.  They also said that to exclude some trusts from the accord would deprive investors in those trusts of other benefits, including servicing improvements that could lead to fewer foreclosures and higher values for their mortgage securities.

4,MET,Six FHLB banks challenge BofA mortgage pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Six of the Federal Home Loan Banks and another investor are seeking to intervene in Bank of America Corp’s $8.5 billion settlement with investors in soured mortgage-backed securities, signaling growing opposition to the accord.  FHLB branches in Boston, Chicago, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Seattle said they have gotten “very little information” to help decide whether the settlement with the largest U.S. bank is fair.  They said they paid more than $8.8 billion, a sum exceeding the entire settlement amount, for securities in 73 trusts backed by home loans from Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008.  Meanwhile, the investor TM1 Investors LLC said it may sue to force Bank of America to buy back its securities, which it said were once worth more than $400 million.  The opposition was expressed in filings on Wednesday in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. It means at least four investors or investor groups are preparing challenges.  Eric Schneiderman, the state attorney general, has asked most of the 22 institutional investors joining the settlement — including BlackRock Inc, MetLife Inc and Allianz SE’s Pacific Investment Management Co — for details about the accord, a sign he may challenge it as well.  The $8.5 billion settlement covers mortgages with a $174 billion unpaid principal balance, about 5 cents on the dollar.  Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment. David Grais, a lawyer for the home loan banks and TM1, also declined to comment.  In their filings, the six home loan banks and TM1 said they are unconvinced that Bank of New York Mellon Corp, trustee for the 530 mortgage pools covered in the settlement, adequately protected their rights in negotiating the accord.  “After much investigation, TM1 believes that many of the loans that Countrywide sold to the trust in which it owns securities did not comply with the representations and warranties” Grais wrote.  “As a result,” he added, “TM1, together with one or more investors in the same trust, is considering legal action on behalf of that trust to enforce Countrywide’s obligation to repurchase those defective loans.”  The 12 federal home loan banks offer financing and grants to help members make mortgage and small business loans, and foster economic development.  One, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, is among the 22 investors that signed on to the Bank of America settlement.  “The federal home loan banks operate independently,” said Sharon Cook, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta bank. “We support the settlement, and the right of other federal home loan banks to further evaluate it.”  Other objections to the accord have come from companies known as Walnut Place LLC, which Grais’ firm represents, and from a group of public pension funds that said some investors could get a “windfall.  If the settlement wins court approval, affected investors would not be allowed to “opt out.” Walnut Place would have to drop its February lawsuit against Bank of America over its securities, once worth $1.06 billion.

7,MET,"SPECIAL REPORT: Banks still robo-signing, filing doubtful foreclosure documents"," (Repeats to delete PDF link)	   * . U.S. banks continue banned practices despite pact with feds   * . Banks that settled continue filing questionable paperwork: Reuters   * . Reuters identifies 6 robo-signers still pumping out documents    By Scot J. Paltrow	   NEW YORK/IMMOKALEE, Florida, July 18 (Reuters) - America’s leading mortgage lenders vowed in March to end the dubious foreclosure practices that caused a bruising scandal last year.	   But a Reuters investigation finds that many are still taking the same shortcuts they promised to shun, from sketchy paperwork to the use of “robo-signers.”	   In its effort to seize the two-bedroom ranch house of 87-year-old Margery Gunter in this down-on-its-luck Florida town, OneWest Bank recently filed a court document that appears riddled with discrepancies. Mrs. Gunter, who has lived in the house for 40 years and gets around with the aid of a walker, stopped paying her loan back in 2009, her lawyer concedes. To foreclose, the bank submitted to the Collier County clerk’s office on March 3 a “mortgage assignment,” a document essential to proving who owns a mortgage once the original lender sells it off.	   But OneWest’s paperwork is problematic. Among the snags: state law permits lenders to file to foreclose only if they already legally own a mortgage. Yet the key document establishing ownership wasn’t signed and officially recorded until months after OneWest filed to foreclose on Mrs. Gunter. OneWest declined to comment on the case.	   Reuters has found that some of the biggest U.S. banks and other “loan servicers” continue to file questionable foreclosure documents with courts and county clerks. They are using tactics that late last year triggered an outcry, multiple investigations and temporary moratoriums on foreclosures.	   In recent months, servicers have filed thousands of documents that appear to have been fabricated or improperly altered, or have sworn to false facts.	   Reuters also identified at least six “robo-signers,” individuals who in recent months have each signed thousands of mortgage assignments — legal documents which pinpoint ownership of a property. These same individuals have been identified — in depositions, court testimony or court rulings — as previously having signed vast numbers of foreclosure documents that they never read or checked.	   Among them: Christina Carter, an employee of Ocwen Loan Servicing of West Palm Beach, Florida, a “sub-servicer” which handles routine mortgage tasks for banks. Her signature — just two “C”s — has appeared on thousands of mortgage assignments and other documents this year.	   In a case involving a foreclosure by HSBC Bank USA, a New York state court judge this month called Carter a “known robo-signer” and said he’d found multiple variations of her two-letter signature on documents, raising questions about whether others were using her name. That and other red flags prompted the judge to take the extraordinary step of threatening to sanction HSBC’s chief executive officer.	   In a phone interview, Carter acknowledged signing large numbers of mortgage assignments this year, but said they all were legally done. To her knowledge, she added, no one else used her name. 	 	   One of the industry’s top representatives admits that the federal settlements haven’t put a stop to questionable practices.	   Some loan servicers “continue to cut corners,” said David Stevens, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. Nearly all borrowers facing foreclosure are delinquent, he said, but “the real question is whether the servicer complied with all legal requirements.” The loss of a home is “the most critical time in a family’s life,” and if foreclosure paperwork is faulty homeowners should contest it. “Families should be using every opportunity they can to protect their rights.” 	   	   Federal bank regulators signed settlements in March with 14 loan servicers — banks and other companies that perform tasks for mortgage investors such as collecting payments from homeowners and when necessary, filing to foreclose. The 14 firms promised further internal investigations, remediation for some who were harmed and a halt to the filing of false documents. All such behavior had stopped by the end of 2010, they said.	   Of these companies, Reuters has found at least five that in recent months have filed foreclosure documents of questionable validity: OneWest, Bank of America , HSBC Bank USA, Wells Fargo and GMAC Mortgage.	   So have half a dozen large servicers that weren’t party to the agreements, including Ocwen Financial Corp and units of Credit Suisse Group AG .	   Spokesmen for the banks and servicers named in this article said that they halted any wrongdoing after disclosures last autumn of robo-signing led them to revise their practices, and they denied filing false documents since then.	   In general, they said their foreclosure cases were legitimate, but for a small number of exceptions, and that criticism by defense lawyers and judges of some types of documentation is based on misinterpretation of the law.	   The persistence of the paperwork mess poses a dilemma for American policymakers and society at large.	   The vast majority of homeowners in foreclosure are in fact delinquent on their mortgage payments. Many bankers and judges view the issue as a technicality. Regardless of legal niceties, they say, people should pay up or lose the collateral on the loans — their houses and condos.	   Increasingly, though, courts are holding that the trusts suing to foreclose don’t actually own the mortgages. Judges have ruled that foreclosing based on flawed or missing evidence violates longstanding laws meant to protect all Americans’ property rights.	   In a landmark decision in January, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court overturned a foreclosure because of a lack of proper documentation.	   “The holder of an assigned mortgage needs to take care to ensure that his legal paperwork is in order,” wrote Justice Robert Cordry in a concurring opinion. “Although there was no apparent actual unfairness here to the (homeowners), that is not the point. Foreclosure is a powerful act with significant consequences, and Massachusetts law has always required that it proceed strictly in accord with the statutes that govern it.” 	  (U.S. Bank National Association, trustee, vs. Antonio Ibanez, 458 Mass. 637.)	   Reuters reviewed records of individual county clerk offices in five states — Florida, Massachusetts, New York, and North and South Carolina — with searchable online databases. Reuters also examined hundreds of documents from court case files, some obtained online and others provided by attorneys.	   The searches found more than 1,000 mortgage assignments that for multiple reasons appear questionable: promissory notes missing required endorsements or bearing faulty ones; and “complaints” (the legal documents that launch foreclosure suits) that appear to contain multiple incorrect facts.	   These are practices that the 14 banks and other loan servicers said had occurred only on a small scale and were halted more than six months ago.	   The settlements included the four largest banks in the United States — Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase & Co , and Citigroup Inc . The other parties were lending units of Ally Financial Inc , HSBC Holdings PLC , MetLife Inc , PNC Financial Services Group Inc , SunTrust Banks Inc , U.S. Bancorp, Aurora Bank, EverBank Ever.N, OneWest Bank and Sovereign Bank.	   The pacts were struck with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the main regulator of national banks, as well as with the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of Thrift Supervision.	   Some state and federal officials have called the settlements weak. Authorities are still working out financial penalties to be imposed on the 14 firms.

8,MET,Tornadoes and interest rates to hit insurers' results,"NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - It’s a rough time to be an insurer, and investors looking at quarterly earnings will be focusing mostly on a single question: How long will the pain last.  The second quarter is likely to go down as one of the worst for the U.S. insurance industry in years, mostly for property insurers, which will report billions of dollars in catastrophe losses due to powerful tornadoes that struck in April and May.  Life insurers fared somewhat better from a performance standpoint, though persistently low interest rates continue to batter their shares and create medium-term uncertainty.  Among the winners in the industry: insurance brokers that could benefit from property insurers’ difficulties.  Property insurers have already disclosed more than $6 billion in losses from the tornadoes that ravaged parts of the country in April and May, so losses will not be a surprise.  Dow industrials component Travelers Companies (TRV.N) has said it expects an operating loss, and others would not surprise if they reported the same. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expect operating losses of 64 cents a share for Travelers and $1.53 for Allstate.  “Major losses from tornadoes, other bad weather and earthquakes have eliminated earnings for many. Meanwhile, top-lines remain weak and investment yields low. In addition, the economy is hardly robust,” KBW analysts said in a July 12 research note.  Share buybacks are off the table after years of multibillion-dollar programs, but KBW said share weakness was an opportunity for investors to buy companies like ACE ACE.N and Chubb (CB.N).  To the extent there is any good news in the quarter, some say, it may come from the Bermudan reinsurers. Langen McAlenney insurance analysts, in a July 11 note, said investors may be pleasantly surprised by premiums in Bermuda, as pricing has started to firm following years of declines.  On the life insurance side of the industry, all signs suggest business has remained somewhat steady.  The problem for life insurers, as it has been of late, is persistently low interest rates. As long-term investments mature, the insurers have to put that capital in new long-term instruments at much lower rates. That could create problems meeting obligations in future years and force insurers to tap their surplus.  Even as low rates weigh on insurance product and annuity sales, Barclays Capital forecast double-digit growth in operating earnings per share on the effect of share buybacks and growth from acquisitions. The country’s two largest life insurers, MetLife (MET.N) and Prudential (PRU.N), are both digesting substantial acquisitions from AIG (AIG.N).  “The life insurance sector could be revalued upward as these companies generate increasingly consistent results,” Barclays said in a note, given the contributions they gain from their expansion of late. Analysts on average expect earnings of $1.13 per share from MetLife and $1.55 for Prudential.  Given the series of catastrophes and rise in business volumes, most brokerages are optimistic about reinsurance brokers like Aon (AON.N), Willis WSH.N and Marsh & McLennan (MMC.N), as they stand to benefit from rising premiums.  Insurance brokers with international exposure like Arthur J Gallagher (AJG.N), Aon and Marsh should also benefit from a weak U.S. dollar, Raymond James analyst Gregory Peters said in a note.  For title insurers, analysts expect home sales to remain sluggish with the depressed real estate markets. The industry has been unable to generate meaningful earnings or premium growth in the last couple of years as business volumes continue to remain low.  “As far as industry growth is concerned I’m not expecting any surprises in the second-quarter. Things are pretty much going to remain the same,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Dwelle said.

On the life insurance side of the industry, all signs suggest business has remained somewhat steady.   The problem for life insurers, as it has been of late, is persistently low interest rates. As long-term investments mature, the insurers have to put that capital in new long-term instruments at much lower rates. That could create problems meeting obligations in future years and force insurers to tap their surplus.   Even as low rates weigh on insurance product and annuity sales, Barclays Capital forecast double-digit growth in operating earnings per share on the effect of share buybacks and growth from acquisitions. The country’s two largest life insurers, MetLife (MET.N) and Prudential (PRU.N), are both digesting substantial acquisitions from AIG (AIG.N).   “The life insurance sector could be revalued upward as these companies generate increasingly consistent results,” Barclays said in a note, given the contributions they gain from their expansion of late. Analysts on average expect earnings of $1.13 per share from MetLife and $1.55 for Prudential.   Given the series of catastrophes and rise in business volumes, most brokerages are optimistic about reinsurance brokers like Aon (AON.N), Willis WSH.N and Marsh & McLennan (MMC.N), as they stand to benefit from rising premiums.   Insurance brokers with international exposure like Arthur J Gallagher (AJG.N), Aon and Marsh should also benefit from a weak U.S. dollar, Raymond James analyst Gregory Peters said in a note.   For title insurers, analysts expect home sales to remain sluggish with the depressed real estate markets. The industry has been unable to generate meaningful earnings or premium growth in the last couple of years as business volumes continue to remain low.   “As far as industry growth is concerned I’m not expecting any surprises in the second-quarter. Things are pretty much going to remain the same,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Dwelle said.

10,MET,"UPDATE 1-SPECIAL REPORT: Banks still robo-signing, filing doubtful foreclosure documents"," (Updates with comment from Ally Financial spokesman in paragraph 54)	   * Banks that settled continue filing questionable paperwork: Reuters   * Reuters identifies 6 robo-signers still pumping out documents   (Read story in multimedia PDF: link.reuters.com/kyb72s)	   By Scot J. Paltrow	   NEW YORK/IMMOKALEE, Florida, July 19(Reuters) - America’s leading mortgage lenders vowed in March to end the dubious foreclosure practices that caused a bruising scandal last year.	   But a Reuters investigation finds that many are still taking the same shortcuts they promised to shun, from sketchy paperwork to the use of “robo-signers.”	   In its effort to seize the two-bedroom ranch house of 87-year-old Margery Gunter in this down-on-its-luck Florida town, OneWest Bank recently filed a court document that appears riddled with discrepancies. Mrs. Gunter, who has lived in the house for 40 years and gets around with the aid of a walker, stopped paying her loan back in 2009, her lawyer concedes. To foreclose, the bank submitted to the Collier County clerk’s office on March 3 a “mortgage assignment,” a document essential to proving who owns a mortgage once the original lender sells it off.	   But OneWest’s paperwork is problematic. Among the snags: state law permits lenders to file to foreclose only if they already legally own a mortgage. Yet the key document establishing ownership wasn’t signed and officially recorded until months after OneWest filed to foreclose on Mrs. Gunter. OneWest declined to comment on the case.	   Reuters has found that some of the biggest U.S. banks and other “loan servicers” continue to file questionable foreclosure documents with courts and county clerks. They are using tactics that late last year triggered an outcry, multiple investigations and temporary moratoriums on foreclosures.	   In recent months, servicers have filed thousands of documents that appear to have been fabricated or improperly altered, or have sworn to false facts.	   Reuters also identified at least six “robo-signers,” individuals who in recent months have each signed thousands of mortgage assignments — legal documents which pinpoint ownership of a property. These same individuals have been identified — in depositions, court testimony or court rulings — as previously having signed vast numbers of foreclosure documents that they never read or checked.	   Among them: Christina Carter, an employee of Ocwen Loan Servicing of West Palm Beach, Florida, a “sub-servicer” which handles routine mortgage tasks for banks. Her signature — just two “C”s — has appeared on thousands of mortgage assignments and other documents this year.	   In a case involving a foreclosure by HSBC Bank USA, a New York state court judge this month called Carter a “known robo-signer” and said he’d found multiple variations of her two-letter signature on documents, raising questions about whether others were using her name. That and other red flags prompted the judge to take the extraordinary step of threatening to sanction HSBC’s chief executive officer.	   In a phone interview, Carter acknowledged signing large numbers of mortgage assignments this year, but said they all were legally done. To her knowledge, she added, no one else used her name. 	 	   One of the industry ‘s top representatives says it is possible that the federal settlements haven’t put a stop to questionable practices. “My judgment is that robo-signing had essentially gone away,” said David Stevens, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. “It doesn’t mean that there aren’t other ways to continue to cut corners, or mistakes occurring with select servicers.”	  Nearly all borrowers facing foreclosure are delinquent, Stevens added, but “the real question is whether the servicer complied with all legal requirements.” The loss of a home is “the most critical time in a family’s life,” and if foreclosure paperwork is faulty homeowners should contest it. “Families should be using every opportunity they can to protect their rights.”	   	   Federal bank regulators signed settlements in March with 14 loan servicers — banks and other companies that perform tasks for mortgage investors such as collecting payments from homeowners and when necessary, filing to foreclose. The 14 firms promised further internal investigations, remediation for some who were harmed and a halt to the filing of false documents. All such behavior had stopped by the end of 2010, they said.	   Of these companies, Reuters has found at least five that in recent months have filed foreclosure documents of questionable validity: OneWest, Bank of America , HSBC Bank USA, Wells Fargo and GMAC Mortgage.

Spokesmen for the banks and servicers named in this article said that they halted any wrongdoing after disclosures last autumn of robo-signing led them to revise their practices, and they denied filing false documents since then.	   In general, they said their foreclosure cases were legitimate, but for a small number of exceptions, and that criticism by defense lawyers and judges of some types of documentation is based on misinterpretation of the law.	   The persistence of the paperwork mess poses a dilemma for American policymakers and society at large.	   The vast majority of homeowners in foreclosure are in fact delinquent on their mortgage payments. Many bankers and judges view the issue as a technicality. Regardless of legal niceties, they say, people should pay up or lose the collateral on the loans — their houses and condos.	   Increasingly, though, courts are holding that the trusts suing to foreclose don’t actually own the mortgages. Judges have ruled that foreclosing based on flawed or missing evidence violates longstanding laws meant to protect all Americans’ property rights.	   In a landmark decision in January, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court overturned a foreclosure because of a lack of proper documentation.	   “The holder of an assigned mortgage needs to take care to ensure that his legal paperwork is in order,” wrote Justice Robert Cordry in a concurring opinion. “Although there was no apparent actual unfairness here to the (homeowners), that is not the point.

12,MET,UPDATE 1-A.M. Best may cut ratings outlook on life insurers," * May move to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’   * Cites sovereign debt among other problems   * S&P had already warned of some insurance downgrades   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - Ratings agency A.M. Best may lower its outlook on the U.S. life insurance and annuity sector to “negative” from “stable,” it warned on Tuesday, as American and European sovereign debt concerns continue to grow.   Life insurers, with long-duration liabilities and a need to safeguard their assets to pay those claims, are major holders of government debt around the world. Given the current circumstances, Best said that has left them exposed.   “Continuing economic weakness in certain European countries and the debt crisis in the United States, which remains unresolved, have elevated the risk profile of life insurers,” the agency said in a statement.   Best is not the first to caution that insurers could feel the sting of sovereign debt woes. Standard & Poor’s warned last Friday that some U.S. insurers could be downgraded if the country were downgraded in the short term. [ID:nN1E76E1AK]   In a separate briefing, Best said it was looking at what impact a U.S. downgrade would have on the portfolios and financial strength ratings of insurers. Early high-level stress testing showed the biggest impacts would be on individual companies and would not necessarily apply across sectors or product lines.

13,MET,UPDATE 4-Deal to move U.S. trade pacts possible soon," * MetLife exec decries political impasse blocking deals   * Kirk says still confident deals will pass soon   * Deal sought on South Korea, Colombia and Panama accords  (Adds lawmakers’ comments, paragraphs 8-12, 20-21)   By Doug Palmer   WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - The Obama administration hopes to announce soon a deal with congressional Republicans to clear the way for votes on three long-delayed free trade agreements, the top U.S. trade official said on Wednesday.   The administration had hoped to win approval of the trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama before the August congressional recess. But a disagreement with Republicans over a worker retraining program called Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) has threatened that.   “We are working so that we can very quickly announce a process on how we will be able to move that forward,” U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a speech at a gathering of insurance companies, banks, express delivery firms and other service sector businesses.   “I am still confident we are going to get these agreements passed, and we’re going to get them passed sooner rather than later,” Kirk said.   Republicans have objected to a White House plan to include an extension of the TAA program in the implementing legislation for the South Korea pact, and have demanded a separate vote on the legislation. But Democrats fear the program will be killed if not shielded by the South Korea pact.   Kirk said the administration is working with congressional leaders to resolve that issue.   TAA is a nearly 50-year-old retraining and income assistance program to help workers who have lost their jobs due to foreign competition.   Republican Representative Kevin Brady, who chairs a key trade subcommittee in the House of Representatives, called for the administration and Senate leaders to reach a quick agreement that would pave the way for the pacts to be approved.   Despite the short time left before the August recess, Brady said he still thought the pacts could win House and Senate approval by then.   “I think the cost of delay is real,” in terms of lost sales to competitors in Europe and Canada and the damage being done around the world to U.S. credibility on trade, he said.   Brady said he was confident TAA could pass on its own in the House and a path could be found to ensure its passage in the Senate, even if it is severed from the South Korea pact.   Democratic Representative Joseph Crowley also said he was anxious to see the pacts approved but the all-consuming negotiations on a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling by Aug. 2 has also been an impediment.   Democrats view TAA as a vital part of the U.S. social safety net. Many Republicans question the program’s cost and effectiveness. The White House has negotiated a bipartisan deal to reform TAA, but it has not reached a deal with Republicans on how Congress will consider the package.   Congress cannot vote on the trade deals until President Barack Obama formally submits them to Congress. Kirk did not comment on growing concern that Obama might not send the deals to Congress until after the August break.   Just before Kirk spoke, the president of insurer MetLife’s (MET.N) international businesses, William Toppeta, expressed frustration widely felt in the U.S. business community that the deals have not been passed by Congress.   “This is a great country and in a great country it ought to be possible for the elected political leadership to come together and pass three excellent trade agreements with staunch allies who have stood with us politically, militarily and economically,” Toppeta said.   “We strongly urge political leadership in the administration and Congress across parties to ratify these agreements immediately. They are critical to the international competitiveness of U.S. companies and workers and to sustain and creating jobs,” Toppeta said.   Kirk told the company executives that the administration understands their frustration and is working hard on the issue. Kirk said he sees less than a 10 percent chance the deals would not be passed by Congress.   A business lobbyist, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said his organization was told on Tuesday that the administration would not submit the agreements until September and had been expecting Kirk or his office to announce that.   Brady said he thought that would be a mistake.   “If the White House is considering not sending them, I hope they’ll reconsider,” Brady said.

14,MET,MetLife puts banking operations up for sale,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - MetLife (MET.N), the largest life insurance company in the United States, has put its banking operations up for sale to avoid the “too big to fail” regulatory scrutiny that analysts have said was likely.  MetLife said on Thursday it may sell MetLife Bank’s depository business, which includes savings and money market accounts. The company said it will still write home mortgages; life insurers tend to like mortgages as part of a diversified investment portfolio.  MetLife has hired Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), which ran the recent sale process for larger online bank ING Direct USA, to handle the sale. One industry source said many of the companies that lost out on ING Direct may look at MetLife Bank, among them Ally Financial and CIT Group (CIT.N).  Ally and CIT declined to comment.  One difference in this deal, a second industry source said, is that many of MetLife Bank’s customers are also customers of the life insurance business, raising questions about whether they would keep their deposits with the bank in the event it was sold.  As of June 30 MetLife was the seventh-largest bank holding company in the United States by total assets, according to the Federal Reserve. The bank itself is, however, usually ranked outside the top 50 by deposits and generated just 2 percent of the company’s operating earnings in the first quarter.  “We do not believe it is appropriate for the overwhelming majority of our business to be governed by regulations written for banking institutions,” MetLife Chief Executive Steve Kandarian said in a statement, adding it was “imperative that MetLife be able to operate on a level playing field.”  That notion of “level playing field” has been central to the global insurance industry’s argument against the regulation of insurers as too big to fail.  The argument goes that any such regulated insurer would have higher capital requirements and tighter risk controls than its peers, forcing it to underwrite less business and be more conservative in its decision-making than competitors.  “While it remains uncertain to what extent the new financial reform regulation will impact the large life insurers, we believe the sale of (MetLife’s) bank would help it avoid stricter capital standards,” Standard & Poor’s insurance equity analyst Bret Howlett said in a note.  FBR Capital Markets said MetLife may be regulated as too big to fail even with the bank sale, but potentially under a different set of standards for non-bank entities that would be more favorable to shareholders.  U.S. regulators are finalizing criteria for which banks should be named as “systemically important financial institutions,” or SIFIs. It is unclear when regulators will actually designate the companies, but it could be later this year.  A SIFI designation comes with tough regulation from the Federal Reserve that will restrain profits, because of stricter capital and leverage requirements.  The companies will also have to submit “living wills” to regulators. These documents will have to be continually updated and offer a blueprint for how the government can quickly and orderly dismantle the companies if they start to fail.  The insurance industry has voting representation on the systemic risk council, known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, in charge of picking SIFIs.  Because of the bank, analysts have widely expected MetLife to be one of the insurers tagged as a SIFI. Other insurers, like Allstate (ALL.N), have sold or explored selling their banks to get out of such oversight.  MetLife closed up 2.8 percent at $42.04 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

16,MET,Countrywide investors may be owed $27.5 bln-filing," * Six FHLB banks have said settlement may be unfair   * $8.5 billion settlement to resolve Countrywide claims   By Jonathan Stempel   NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) may have to pay $27.5 billion to reach a fair settlement with investors in soured Countrywide mortgage-backed securities, more than three times the $8.5 billion it agreed to pay, a group of Federal Home Loan Banks said.   In a Thursday filing in a New York state court, the banks said expert reports used as support for the settlement by Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), the trustee for the 530 covered mortgage pools, “raise more questions than they answer” and may be based on false assumptions.   FHLB branches in Boston, Chicago, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Seattle paid more than $8.8 billion for securities in 73 trusts backed by home loans from Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought in 2008.   They and several other investor groups are seeking more details about whether the $8.5 billion accord announced last month is fair before deciding whether to challenge it.   The accord covers mortgages with a $174 billion unpaid principal balance, and is intended to resolve much of Bank of America’s remaining legal liability tied to Countrywide.   Eric Schneiderman, the New York state attorney general, has asked most of the 22 institutional investors that joined the accord for more details, a sign he may challenge it as well.   Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank believes the trustee acted appropriately in entering the settlement, and conducted “extensive due diligence” prior to doing so. Bank of New York Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment.   In their filing, the home loan banks said the expert reports have “little value” because they appear to have been written in hindsight after the settlement was reached.   They questioned in particular one report by Brian Lin, a managing director at mortgage strategist RRMS Advisors, that called a $8.8 billion to $11 billion payout “reasonable.”   According to the banks, Lin, in examining the trusts, may have understated the number of expected defaults, the ability to recover loan principal via foreclosures, and the number of loans that Bank of America should repurchase.   If the bank were forced to buy back all loans that were in default and which breached Countrywide’s representations and warranties, rather than the 40 percent Lin estimated, “then Mr. Lin’s estimate of a reasonable settlement would rise from a range of $8.8 to $11 billion to a range of $22 billion to $27.5 billion,” the filing said. “Modifying any of his other three assumptions would cause that range to rise much more.”   Lin did not immediately return a call seeking comment.   The 12 federal home loan banks offer financing and grants to help members make mortgage and small business loans, and foster economic development. The Atlanta home loan bank is among the 22 investors that signed on to the accord.   New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan scheduled a Nov. 17 hearing on the settlement.   The case is In re: The Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011.

17,MET,UPDATE 5-Republican senator presses Obama on trade deals," * Portman says has votes for worker retraining program   * Fears deals will be harder to pass after August   * Others doubt enough time to pass before August break   * Korea deal still pending in Korean legislature  (Recasts throughout, Portman comments, other details)   By Doug Palmer   WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Senator Rob Portman on Wednesday urged President Barack Obama to quickly send three long-delayed free-trade pacts to Congress for approval, rather than wait until after the August congressional recess.  Portman, a former U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush, also said 12 Republican senators have agreed to support an extension of Trade Adjustment Assistance, a worker retraining program that Obama has insisted be approved along with the pacts.  That, combined with the 53 votes in the Democratic caucus, would be enough to ensure that Republican opponents of Trade Adjustment Assistance in the Senate can not block it, he said.   “Mr. President, please tear down these walls. Send these agreements forward,” Portman said, echoing late President Ronald Reagan’s call for the Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall.   “If we don’t (pass the agreements with South Korea, Colombia  and Panama) now, my fear is that over the August break there will be additional pressure from those who oppose the agreements,” said Portman, an Ohio Republican.   The administration has hoped to win approval of the three trade deals before the August recess but with each passing day that looks increasingly doubtful, due in large part to intense negotiations on a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling by Aug. 2 that is occupying both the White House and Congress.   While Portman may have enough votes to overcome an initial procedural effort to kill Trade Adjustment Assistance, Democratic sources said a Senate leadership deal is needed to give the White House confidence the program will survive a prolonged Senate debate.   Trade Adjustment Assistance, known as TAA, is a nearly 50-year-old retraining and income assistance program to help workers who have lost their jobs due to foreign competition.   Republicans have objected to a White House plan to include an extension of the TAA program in the implementing legislation for the South Korea trade deal and have demanded a separate vote on the legislation. But Democrats fear the program will be killed if not shielded by the South Korea pact.   Democrats view TAA as a vital part of the U.S. social safety net. Many Republicans question the program’s cost and effectiveness. The White House has negotiated a bipartisan deal to reform TAA but it has not reached a deal with Republicans on how Congress will consider the package.   Early on Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said he hoped a deal would be struck soon with Senate leaders on a path to consider both TAA and the pacts.   “I am still confident we are going to get these agreements passed and we’re going to get them passed sooner rather than later,” Kirk said.   But a business lobbyist, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said his organization was told on Tuesday that the administration would not submit the agreements until September. Kirk’s office has not confirmed that.   A Senate Democratic aide, also speaking on condition he not be identified, said the only way the pacts could be passed quickly was if Republicans agreed to let TAA remain in the legislation to implement the Korea pact.   Given the tight floor schedule, the demand for a separate vote on TAA makes it impractical the pacts could be passed before September, he said.   Still, Republican Representative Kevin Brady, who chairs a key trade subcommittee in the House of Representatives, urged the administration and Senate leaders to reach an agreement allowing the pacts to be approved in coming weeks.   “If the White House is considering not sending them, I hope they’ll reconsider,” Brady said.   The United States risks losing sales to competitors in Europe and Canada, which have negotiated their own agreements with the countries, Brady said.    The South Korean parliament also needs to pass the U.S.-Korea agreement for it to go into force. South Korea’s ruling Grand National Party chief repeated a pledge to see the deal ratified in August.   South Korea’s opposition Democratic Party has issued 10 points it wants revised, including a delay in the opening of the beef market, before it can agree on ratifying the deal.

18,MET,MetLife beats forecasts despite natural disasters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N), the largest U.S. life insurer, posted a smaller profit on Thursday as natural disasters at home and abroad and a sharp increase in expenses ate into earnings.  But the company beat expectations easily on an operating basis, and shares rose 2.5 percent in after-hours trading.  MetLife, which had already warned of an unexpectedly large catastrophe loss in the quarter because of severe tornadoes in April and May, said disaster losses totaled $174 million in the second quarter. It also took a hit of $44 million from claims and expenses for the March earthquake in Japan.  The company reported a net profit of $1.21 billion, or $1.13 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $1.53 billion, or $1.84 per share.  While revenue was up, total expenses rose more than 30 percent, with virtually all categories showing a sharp increase over a year earlier. Late last year, the company acquired the international insurance business Alico from AIG (AIG.N), bulking it up globally while adding costs.  On an operating basis, excluding investment gains and losses, the company earned $1.24 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, on average, estimated the company would earn $1.10 per share.  In MetLife’s U.S. business, the company said variable annuity sales rose 55 percent to nearly $7 billion, while strength in group life plans drove double-digit gains in the insurance business.  Internationally, Japan and Latin America led improved results, demonstrating the benefits of the company’s late-2010 acquisition of Alico.  MetLife also said operating earnings at MetLife Bank fell sharply in the quarter on higher expenses and lower mortgage business.

20,MET,Analysis: New asbestos charges point to reserve woes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asbestos-related diseases have been falling for a decade, but warnings from a pair of U.S. insurance giants about new claims raise questions about the industry’s ability to put the scourge behind it.  While medical evidence suggests fewer new cases of asbestosis and the lung cancer mesothelioma, insurers say they are getting sued more frequently and aggressively by people with claims against “peripheral insureds,” such as contractors that worked on projects where asbestos was used.  As some of these lawsuits succeed in courts across the country, it fuels new suits by aggressive plaintiffs’ lawyers and compounds the problem for insurers trying to understand their exposure.  The disconnect between a waning disease and flourishing claims also exposes a flaw endemic to insurers. When they set aside reserves for indistinct risks, they are making guesses — even if educated ones — on how long a particular risk will endure and what it will cost them to be done with it.  No law says any particular company’s guess has to match anyone else’s, but investors raise alarms about companies where reserves are not in line with peers.  That’s why Hartford Financial’s announcement this month of a $290 million pretax earnings hit from increasing reserves for asbestos cases fostered concerns beyond the insurer’s citation of rising claims for mesothelioma.  “Although these items are one-time events, the result raises questions about ... reserve adequacy,” Barclays Capital analyst Jay Gelb said in a note to investors. He was referring to both the asbestos charge and Hartford’s sharp rise in second-quarter catastrophe losses.  American International Group Inc similarly riled investors in early February with a $4.1 billion addition to its reserves, including more than $1 billion related to its asbestos exposure.  Fitch Ratings responded by cutting the credit rating on AIG’s domestic property unit insurance units, calling the charges “a significant outlier” compared to competitors and the whole property insurance market.  According to insurance ratings agency AM Best, the Hartford had the fourth-highest level of asbestos and environmental reserves of all large property insurers at the end of 2009 while AIG ranked seventh. They also ranked in the top seven in terms of average annual asbestos losses in 2005-2009.  AIG and The Hartford are in particularly sensitive positions since they were two of the three insurers who took government bailouts during the financial crisis. Their reserve accounting has not been questioned by any of their regulators.  For decades asbestos was a favorite material in building products, naval applications and other industrial settings because of its fire-retardant properties. Over time, though, exposure to its microscopic fibers causes health problems.  More recently, many of the rescue workers at the Ground Zero site in New York after the 9/11 attacks were exposed to high concentrations of asbestos - in some cases, reports have said, nearly a million times the normal background level.  To be sure, some of the new claims stem from plaintiffs’ lawyers becoming more effective at suing people who are only peripherally connected to asbestos victims. Late-night cable television is flooded with ads from asbestos lawyers, and “mesothelioma” is among the most valuable of advertising keywords on Google. Since there is still plenty of asbestos in buildings across the country, it is also possible that new cases are adding to insurers’ burdens.  Best warned in February that the insurance industry is generally underfunded in its asbestos reserves. It cited a growing number of legal claims reflecting a weakening of tort reform in some states and the “ongoing filing of mesothelioma claims for years to come.”  Asbestos claims have been a bane of insurers for at least a decade. They nearly brought down the Lloyd’s of London market in the 1990s and have cost some of the industry’s largest players billions of dollars. Insurers like MetLife were accused for decades of helping to conceal the deadly side effects of the fire retardant.  In recent years, insurance investors have been celebrating the steady decline of asbestos-related claims and reserves. According to the Insurance Information Institute, reserves grew every year from 2001 to 2005, then shrank every year since through 2009.  The trend appeared to be tracking the medical evidence. New cases of malignant mesothelioma, a lung cancer caused only by asbestos exposure that one oncologist called a “tremendously lousy disease,” declined at an annual rate of 1.8 percent from 1999 to 2008, according to the American Cancer Society.  “I am surprised myself to hear insurers are (seeing) more claims, because we think with the reduction of asbestos years back we’re starting to see a reduction in incidence of the disease,” said Kevin Becker, an oncologist at Maimonides Medical Center in New York.  Annual reports from MetLife, the country’s largest life insurer, show new claims and total outstanding claims dropping at a steady pace from 2003 through 2010, declining around 40 percent over the period.  The sums paid annually by the industry as settlements also have generally been shrinking. A.M. Best’s forecast that the insurance industry may ultimately end up paying $75 billion in asbestos claims over time seems inflated to some regulators.  “I can’t speak for everyone out there but (claims) may be a little less than that,” said Joseph Torti, Rhode Island’s superintendent of insurance and the designated spokesman on asbestos issues for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  LONG-TERM CHALLENGE  But deciding to build or draw down reserves remains a crapshoot for insurers.  Mesothelioma has an incredibly long latency period, meaning 30 years or more can pass between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the cancer. That is why companies such as Travelers and Berkshire Hathaway continue to build reserves.  “Trends were kind of favorable, but you still see the companies with exposure kind of trickling up their reserves from time to time,” said Jim Auden, head of the property and casualty insurance unit at Fitch Ratings.  Another concern for insurers are new and expensive therapies being developed to treat mesothelioma.  The upshot? Asbestos claims and payments are not going away, and no one knows when the bend will turn.  “You wish that this would be completed,” Auden said. “These claims are tied to activities in the ‘70s mostly (and) you still can’t get your arms around it.”  ",7282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-asbestos/analysis-new-asbestos-charges-point-to-reserve-woes-idUSTRE76R4CW20110728
21,MET,"UPDATE 1-Bank CEOs warn ""grave"" consequences if no debt deal"," WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - Chief executives from the nation’s largest financial firms on Thursday pressured the White House and Congress to reach a deal on the debt ceiling and deficit reduction, saying the consequences of inaction “would be very grave.”   JPMorgan’s (JPM.N) Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs’ (GS.N) Lloyd Blankfein and Bank of America’s (BAC.N) Brian Moynihan, among others, said in a letter that an agreement needs to be reached this week.   “A default on our nation’s obligations, or a downgrade of America’s credit rating, would be a tremendous blow to business and investor confidence — raising interest rates for everyone who borrows, undermining the value of the dollar, and roiling stock and bond markets — and, therefore, dramatically worsening our nation’s already difficult economic circumstances,” the letter said.   The letter from the chief executives come as Congress and the White House struggle to broker a deal to raise the country’s $14.3 trillion debt cap before Aug. 2 when the U.S. Treasury will no longer be able to borrow funds to pay all of its bills.   That has raised the specter of default and businesses from the big banks to manufacturers are alarmed by the potential fallout.   Citigroup’s (C.N) Vikram Pandit, Metlife Inc’s (MET.N) Steven Kandarian and Morgan Stanley’s (MS.N) James Gorman were also among the chief executives who signed the letter.

22,MET,UPDATE 2-India's PNB to buy 30 pct stake in Metlife India," * Deal value not disclosed   * Metlife India to issue fresh equity   * PNB April-June profit in-line   (Adds details on Metlife deal, quotes, background)	   By Anurag Kotoky	   NEW DELHI, Jul 28 (Reuters) - Punjab National Bank (PNB)  , India’s No. 2 state-run lender, on Thursday said it plans to buy a 30 percent stake in the Indian venture of Metlife  , the biggest U.S. life insurer, for an undisclosed amount.	  PNB also agreed to enter into a 10-year distribution tie-up with Metlife India, in which Jammu and Kashmir Bank  and M.Pallonji & co also hold stakes.	   PNB will pick up the stake via a fresh share issue which will dilute the stake of all existing shareholders in Metlife India, but the U.S. company plans to bring back its  stake to the original 26 percent within 120 days after the deal closes, said William Toppeta, president of MetLife`s international business.	   The deal is expected to be closed by end-2011.	   “India is a very important market for Metlife. We have identified 10 strategic markets around the world, and at the top of that list, its India,” Toppeta told reporters.	   PNB, which bought out the stakes of its insurance joint venture partners Principal Financial Group of Mauritius  and 25 percent of Berger Paints last year, had invited expressions of interest (EoIs) from insurers for a fresh strategic tie-up.	   It had short-listed 10 companies in March and narrowed the list to three firms: Aviva Life , MetLife and Bharti Axa Life, a joint venture between  Bharati Enterprises, that controls India’s top telecoms firm Bharti Airtel  and AXA , Europe’s second biggest insurer.	   Last month, Reliance Industries , India’s biggest listed firm said it would buy Bharti Enterprises’s stakes in two insurance joint ventures with AXA to build on moves beyond its core energy business. 	    India’s life insurance sector, once in the complete grip of state-run Life Insurance Corporation, is today teeming with about two dozen private players, mostly operating in joint ventures with leading foreign players such as AIG , Allianz , Standard Life and Axa.	   Indian laws limit foreign insurer’s equity participation to 26 percent. Unlisted Life Insurance Corporation of India is still the most dominant player in India.	   If foreign direct investment limits are relaxed, Metlife will be open to increase its stake further in the Indian venture, Metlife’s Toppeta said.  	   APRIL-JUNE RESULTS MUTED	   Earlier on Thursday, PNB posted a 3.5 percent rise in April-June profit to 11.05 billion rupees.	   Higher interest rates inflated deposit costs, bad loans and shrank treasury income and investment portfolio kept profit growth muted, though it was in line with analyst expectations.	   A Reuters poll of brokerages showed analysts expected PNB to post a profit of 11.2 billion rupees for the period.	  A series of interest rate hikes to tame stubborn inflation is slowing loan growth and hurting asset quality, especially at state banks with heavy exposure to smaller commercial borrowers.  	   PNB shares, valued at about $8.1 billion, ended down 2 percent at 1103 rupees in a weak Mumbai market. In comparison, the BSE Banking index was down about 1.33 percent.	    The Reserve Bank of India, seen as one of the most aggressive central banks globally in its efforts to tame inflation, on Tuesday raised key policy rate by a surprise 50 basis points. It also cut credit growth forecast for banks to 18 percent from 19 percent projected earlier. 	   Last week, India’s No. 3 lender HDFC Bank said it expects its loan book to grow more than the sector’s  this fiscal year, though credit demand from corporates for new projects  may not see a sharp spike amid rising interest rates.  	   PNB’s interest income rose by a fifth on the year to 83.16 billion rupees, while interest expended rose more than 50 percent to 52 billion rupees in the June quarter.	   The quality of asset at the bank deteriorated in the June quarter with net non-performing asset rising to 0.86 percent from 0.66 percent.	   “I do acknowledge that incremental slippages have been there but we have put across a mechanism to handle the rise in NPAs,” chairman K. R. Kamath said.	   The bank recorded a net interest margin (NIM), the key barometer of bank’s core operation, of 3.84 percent for the quarter. 	   It expects to maintain NIM at 3.5 percent in FY12 as it hopes to maintain low-cost CASA (current account, saving account) deposits at a high proportion of 38 percent in the overall deposits, Rakesh Sethi, executive director, said.

26,MET,MetLife says asbestos claims on the rise," * Claims up 11 pct in first half of 2011   * Claims fell 40 percent from 2003 to 2010   * AIG, Hartford have boosted asbestos reserves this year   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Asbestos-related claims against MetLife Inc (MET.N) rose 11 percent in the first half of the year, the company said on Friday, mirroring recent comments by other large insurers who have experienced more claims than they expected.   MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, received 2,306 asbestos-related claims in the first half, up from 2,076 in the same period of 2010, the company said in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   It did not offer details on the potential size of those claims or how that compares to claims from past years. MetLife’s new asbestos claims dropped at a steady pace from 2003 through 2010, falling 40 percent over the period.   MetLife has one of the longest and most complicated histories when it comes to asbestos and the insurance industry. Lawsuits have alleged that MetLife employees knew of the insulating material’s harmful health effects as early as the 1920s, claims the company has rejected.   This year, both American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Hartford Financial Services (HIG.N) have made substantial additions to their asbestos reserves, given an increase in claims and claim severity.   The industry argues that many of the new claims stem from plaintiffs’ lawyers becoming more effective at suing people who are only peripherally connected to asbestos victims. Late-night cable television is flooded with ads from asbestos lawyers, and “mesothelioma” is among the most valuable of advertising keywords on Google.   Yet even as claims rise, doctors say the actual incidence of asbestos-linked diseases like the lung cancer mesothelioma is on the decline. Doctors are being more aggressive in treating the cases that do pop up, though, which also contributes to elevated costs for insurers.   Ratings agency A.M. Best has said it expects the industry to ultimately face $75 billion in exposure to asbestos claims, and it has argued that some companies are still not fully reserved for claims they may experience.

27,MET,Insight: Investors rush to cash as economic turmoil worsens,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - It was the week of the defensive crouch. In the face of wrenching global economic and political events, many traders, corporate treasurers and pension managers decided that cash and U.S. Treasuries were the safest places to be.  The S&P 500 absorbed its worst one week decline since November 2008 as concerns grew about the inability of world political leaders to deal with the European debt crisis or the faltering U.S. economic recovery.  And even though the S&P and other U.S. stock indices closed Friday either modestly higher or lower, the flight to safety in the form of cold hard cash is one that seems unlikely to end anytime soon.  Volatile trading is likely to continue until investors see some credible plan for dealing with the sovereign debt crisis plaguing Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and now Italy.  Money managers also say the toxic battle in Washington over raising the nation’s debt ceiling, which led to the threat of a default, has left them doubting the ability of U.S. politicians to work together to jump-start the economy.  “I feel like I’ve been through the ringer,” says Joelle Mevi, the chief investment officer of the Public Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico, commenting on this week’s Wall Street slide.  Mevi says she’s become “less optimistic” about the U.S. economy and is moving to sell some of the $11.6 billion pension fund’s stock holdings to double the fund’s cash reserve to $200 million. She notes that normally her New Mexico pension fund keeps nothing in cash.  Clearly, she isn’t alone in thinking about lightening up on stocks. Individual investors pulled some $7.5 billion out of U.S. stock mutual funds during the week ending August 3, which was the highest weekly outflow from stocks since mid-August 2010, according to Lipper data.  A number of traders say European financial institutions also were selling U.S. stocks to build up cash reserves in light of the mounting sovereign debt problems overseas.  And large U.S. corporations, already hoarding nearly $1.2 trillion in cash, are still beefing-up their balance sheets. In a conference call with investors Friday, MetLife Chief Investment Officer Steve Goulart said the large insurer recently “added several billion dollars of excess cash” to its reserves.  “We think it is a prudent thing to do in an environment of uncertainty that exists today,” said Goulart.  Companies are moving money into non-interest-paying bank accounts that carry an unlimited guarantee from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The accounts, set-up by Congress last year to provide added assurance to businesses in the event of a bank failure, carry unlimited FDIC insurance.  One of those companies using the new FDIC non-interest bearing accounts is the maker of glass for televisions, Corning Inc., which moved $1 billion into one account during the middle of the debt ceiling crisis as a safe haven.  Corning Treasurer Mark Rogus says even though the debt ceiling dispute is over, the company intends to keep its $1 billion there so it doesn’t “have to worry about market movements.”  The rush to cash has been so great that Bank of New York Mellon Corp, one of the world’s largest custodial banks, has been overwhelmed by deposits and has begun charging some of its institutional customers a fee.  Another safe haven for corporations remains U.S. Treasuries, which emerged from the debt ceiling crisis as an appealing place to put funds even though Standard & Poor’s decision to cut the United States’ coveted triple-A credit rating on Friday night was widely expected.  In fact, the Treasury market rallied strongly over the past week with yields on the two-year note hitting a record low of 0.25 percent on August 4.  Supposedly savvy hedge fund managers also were quick to adopt a defensive stance this week. Many managers moved to liquidate stock positions to reduce losses at the first indications that this was going to be no ordinary stock pullback.  Some say a good deal of Thursday’s 513 point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average was due to nervous hedge fund managers bringing down their exposure to U.S. stocks.  To that point, Options Clearing Corp says a  record 33.04 million stock options were traded on Thursday, an indication that many fast-money traders were using derivative contracts to hedge their exposure to stocks and other assets.  Trading was so frenzied on Thursday that it briefly led to a delay in processing some trades at Goldman Sachs Group’s clearing business.  “Hedge funds have been reducing net exposure to the markets,” said David King, a managing partner with Houston-based U.S. Capital Advisors, a financial services firm with about $1.5 billion in client money under management. “This to me looks a lot like what we saw last summer when the market pulled back and there was a radical change in sentiment.”  In fact, others are pointing to similarities between this market swoon and one that took place last August. A Goldman Sachs trader issued a note on Friday in which he attributed some of the market turmoil to insurers buying Treasuries and selling equities. The Goldman trader said a similar thing happened last August when stocks fell precipitously.  Last year’s summer sell-off only ended when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled the Fed was ready to provide more support to the U.S. economy, which eventually led to the central bank’s purchase of $600 billion of Treasuries — the second so-called quantitative easing, or QE2.  That bond buying came to end in June, and some analysts feared the rally in stocks would end once the Fed exited from the market.  One reason the U.S. stock market probably stabilized Friday, after falling sharply in the morning, was the news that the European Central Bank is willing to buy Italian and Spanish bonds if those governments make structural reforms. At least a few traders who did not want to be identified likened it to the ECB heading down its own quantitative easing path.  But it’s not clear whether the Fed is willing to launch QE3 to give the U.S. economy another jolt. And it’s also unclear whether politicians in Washington will be able to agree on any concrete plans for tackling the nation’s 9.1 percent unemployment rate by providing the kind of stimulus that may be needed to get the economy back to any semblance of health.  The fear is that with the European debt crisis still unresolved and the U.S. economy limping along, investors may have to brace themselves for more scary trading days like Thursday. And it’s not just in the equity markets that investors and traders need to prepare for the unexpected.  For example, John Taylor, who runs an $8-billion currency hedge fund in New York, says he was blindsided Thursday by the Bank of Japan’s decision to intervene by selling yen to rein in the currency’s gains against the U.S. dollar. Taylor, whose fund is betting on a strong yen, took a pounding on the move.  “We lost money yesterday,” said Taylor. “We didn’t have the right yen position. We didn’t see this BOJ intervention coming. But we have mostly recovered our losses.”  William Larkin, portfolio manager with Cabot Money Management in Boston, said months ago he told colleagues that if the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 2.5 percent he would sell some bond assets — but he never thought it would get there.  To his amazement it did and Larkin, whose firm manages more than $500 million, was able to do the trade and use the money to purchase some European assets and raise his cash levels.  “I had told them the alarm bell would ring if we breached 2.5 percent. I was joking because I never thought it would get that low again,” Larkin said.  Then again, these are unusual times in the global economy.

28,MET,INSIGHT-Investors rush to cash as economic turmoil worsens," * Move to cash triggered by global economic turmoil   * Cash to be king until there is credible Euro debt plan   * Concern over faltering US economy also taking toll   * Individual investors pull $7.5 bln from U.S. stock funds   By Matthew Goldstein   NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - It was the week of the defensive crouch. In the face of wrenching global economic and political events, many traders, corporate treasurers and pension managers decided that cash and U.S. Treasuries were the safest places to be.   The S&P 500 .SPX absorbed its worst one week decline since November 2008 as concerns grew about the  inability of world political leaders to deal with the European debt crisis or the faltering U.S. economic recovery.   And even though the S&P and other U.S. stock indices closed Friday either modestly higher or lower, the flight to safety in the form of cold hard cash is one that seems unlikely to end anytime soon.   Volatile trading is likely to continue until investors see some credible plan for dealing with the sovereign debt crisis plaguing Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and now Italy.   Money managers also say the toxic battle in Washington over raising the nation’s debt ceiling, which led to the threat of a default, has left them doubting the ability of U.S. politicians to work together to jump-start the economy.   “I feel like I’ve been through the ringer,” says Joelle Mevi, the chief investment officer of the Public Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico, commenting on this week’s Wall Street slide.   Mevi says she’s become “less optimistic” about the U.S. economy and is moving to sell some of the $11.6 billion pension fund’s stock holdings to double the fund’s cash reserve to $200 million. She notes that normally her New Mexico pension fund keeps nothing in cash.   Clearly, she isn’t alone in thinking about lightening up on stocks. Individual investors pulled some $7.5 billion out of U.S. stock mutual funds during the week ending Aug. 3, which was the highest weekly outflow from stocks since mid-August 2010, according to Lipper data.   A number of traders say European financial institutions also were selling U.S. stocks to build up cash reserves in light of the mounting sovereign debt problems overseas.   And large U.S. corporations, already hoarding nearly $1.2 trillion in cash, are still beefing-up their balance sheets. In a conference call with investors Friday, MetLife (MET.N) Chief Investment Officer Steve Goulart said the large insurer recently “added several billion dollars of excess cash” to its reserves.   “We think it is a prudent thing to do in an environment of uncertainty that exists today,” said Goulart.   Companies are moving money into non-interest-paying bank accounts that carry an unlimited guarantee from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The accounts, set-up by Congress last year to provide added assurance to businesses in the event of a bank failure, carry unlimited FDIC insurance.   One of those companies using the new FDIC non-interest bearing accounts is the maker of glass for televisions, Corning Inc (GLW.N)., which moved $1 billion into one account during the middle of the debt ceiling crisis as a safe haven.   Corning Treasurer Mark Rogus says even though the debt ceiling dispute is over, the company intends to keep its $1 billion there so it doesn’t “have to worry about market movements.”   The rush to cash has been so great that Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), one of the world’s largest custodial banks, has been overwhelmed by deposits and has begun charging some of its institutional customers a fee.   Another safe haven for corporations remains U.S. Treasuries, which emerged from the debt ceiling crisis as an appealing place to put funds even though Standard & Poor’s decision to cut the United States’ coveted triple-A credit rating on Friday night was widely expected.   In fact, the Treasury market rallied strongly over the past week with yields on the two-year note hitting a record low of 0.25 percent on August 4.   Supposedly savvy hedge fund managers also were quick to adopt a defensive stance this week. Many managers moved to liquidate stock positions to reduce losses at the first indications that this was going to be no ordinary stock pullback.

29,MET,Top insurers plunge amid market rout,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of the largest U.S. insurers plunged on Monday, with some of the top names losing more than 10 percent, as the Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the United States’ credit rating rippled through the markets.  The S&P insurance index .GSPINSC fell 6.5 percent to its lowest level in two years. Every stock in the index was down, and only two — conglomerates Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and Loews Corp (L.N) — were down less than 5 percent.  The declines came amid a broad market plunge that saw the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI drop 500 points and the S&P 500 index .SPX lose more than 6 percent at one point.  The largest decliner in both the insurance index and the S&P 500 was mortgage and life insurer Genworth Financial (GNW.N), down 20.9 percent at $5.36 in afternoon trading.  Genworth has been under severe pressure of late as mortgage insurers report deteriorating market conditions that threaten their ability to survive. Genworth, which has said it may split in two, has lost half of its value in the last five weeks.  Other leading decliners included Hartford Financial (HIG.N), down 13 percent; AIG (AIG.N), down 11.1 percent; and MetLife (MET.N), 8.4 percent lower.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners said early Monday the U.S. debt downgrade would not have any impact on insurance companies from a regulatory standpoint, easing fears they might be caught short of capital requirements by not having enough AAA-rated investments on their books.  However, analysts say it could matter from a valuation perspective, particularly if the price of U.S. debt falls and hurts the book value of insurance companies, which hold huge piles of U.S. Treasury securities.  “Since most property-casualty insurers trade on book value, the property-casualty stocks would thus also likely fall. Some investors continue to value life insurers on book value, so the life insurance stocks would probably fall as well,” analysts at Sandler O’Neill said in a research note.

30,MET,Insurance shares rally on valuation calls,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurance shares rallied sharply on Tuesday, after having their worst day in 28 months Monday, as a number of analysts said valuations had become too attractive to ignore.  The S&P insurance index .GSPINSC rose 3.7 percent in early trading, with all 22 index components higher. On Monday, the index fell 8.1 percent — its biggest drop since April 2009 — with all 22 components down roughly 6 percent or more.  Both Monday’s plunge and Tuesday’s bounce reflected the broader markets, which had one of their worst days ever before rebounding.  Barclays Capital upgraded Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), Progressive Corp (PGR.N) and Chubb Corp (CB.N) to “overweight” from “equal weight,” citing their valuations and strong position relative to the rest of the property and casualty insurance industry.  Bernstein Research was just as positive on life insurers, saying circumstances were different now than in late 2007, with better liquidity and a better market understanding of the companies’ interest rate risks. The firm said it prefers MetLife (MET.N), Prudential Financial (PRU.N) and Ameriprise Financial (AMP.N).  The recent plunge comes as insurers languish at historically low valuations. Many insurers are trading at or slightly below book value, whereas in good times many may trade at twice that.

35,MET,"GE, Edison hire advisers for power plant - sources"," * Sources: Blackstone, Barclays hired as advisers   * Options include sale, debt or equity financing   * Alternatives eyed as costs for coal-powered plants rise   By Caroline Humer   Sept 20 (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) and Edison International (EIX.N) have hired strategic advisers for the restructuring or possible sale of a Pennsylvania power plant that needs costly environmental upgrades, according to sources familiar with the situation.  In addition to trying to raise cash by issuing new debt and equity to help bring the coal-powered plant up to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, a sale may also be considered, the sources said.   Edison operates the plant and pays rent to GE, the owner.   The move comes as power companies nationwide are struggling to align costs due to an abundance of natural gas and higher costs for coal-powered production. Dynegy Inc DYN.N, for instance, is restructuring its $5 billion in debt.   Edison International has said it needs $600 million to $700 million in capital to make the changes to the Homer City, Pennsylvania plant during the next few years.   GE has retained the Blackstone Group (BX.N) to advise it, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. GE owns most of the plant after buying it from Edison in a $1.6 billion “leaseback” transaction in 2001.   Edison, according to the sources, has hired Barclays Plc (BARC.L).   Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft restructuring lawyer George Davis is representing debt holders. There is $678 million in outstanding debt maturing in 2019 and 2026, according to Thomson Reuters data. The debt is backed by the plant and the lease.   One source said that the existing debt may not be affected in a restructuring. But bringing on additional debt could trip covenants in the existing debt and therefore require some changes in the debt, another source said.   GE, Blackstone, and Barclays declined to comment on Tuesday. Edison was not immediately available for comment.   During a conference call in August, Edison executives said they were seeking third-party financing in addition to financing from the owners who lease the plant. In addition to GE, MetLife (MET.N) also owns a small stake in the plant.   Many older coal-powered plants have become almost too costly to run.   Stricter regulations being formulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reduce air and water pollution as well as to control the handling of coal waste are expected to force the retirement of between 30,000 and 70,000 megawatts of coal generation across the country, according to several industry studies. Typically 1 megawatt can provide power to about 1,000 homes.   Texas power generator Luminant said on Monday it will cut 500 jobs, idle two units and make operational changes under new stricter federal air pollution rules.

36,MET,UPDATE 1-Paulson's resort group settles with Singapore fund," * Paulson hotel group to pay Singapore as part of deal   * Bankruptcy court judge approves settlement   * Settlement should help avoid litigation  (Adds details from hearing, NEW YORK to dateline, byline, bullet points, new throughout)   By Caroline Humer   NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - A group of hotels owned by hedge fund Paulson & Co has reached a settlement with the Government of Singapore Investment Corp [GIC.UL] that the group says will allow it the leeway it needs to come up with a plan to emerge from bankruptcy.   The Singapore fund had been fighting Paulson’s plans for the hotel group, which includes the Doral Golf Resort & Spa in Miami, Florida and four other luxury hotels, and had offered to buy the hotel group just days after it filed for bankruptcy.   A bankruptcy court judge on Tuesday approved the settlement, in which the Singapore investment fund agreed to stop its near-term pursuit of the company in return for payments from the Paulson-owned hotels, called MSR Resort.   Five Mile Capital, which owns junior debt in the company, was part of the settlement as well.   The Paulson-owned hotel group said in court documents it has also had discussions with other creditors including Midland Loan Services, a unit of PNC Financial Services Group (PNC.N), MetLife (MET.N) and the creditors committee about reaching an agreed-upon plan to restructure the hotels.   Paulson & Co. bought the hotels from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in January in a foreclosure auction and then filed for bankruptcy protection for them on Feb. 1, saying that it would use the courts to restructure the hotels and increase their value.   If they are worth enough to pay off all the creditors, then Paulson will continue to own the hotels when they emerge from bankruptcy. Indeed, as part of the agreement, the Paulson-owned hotel group has agreed to pay the Singapore government investment fund in full in cash.   The fund in turn has agreed to give the hotel group until Sept. 1, 2012, to put a bankruptcy plan in place. If it does not, the hotel group has agreed that it will put the assets up for auction.   The hotel group also said it will pay the Singapore fund various fees and expenses and make a $1 million payment to it to offset costs associated with the bid for the hotel company.   Creditors had objected to the Paulson hotel group’s request earlier this year for more time to have the exclusive right to come up with a reorganization plan.   In June, a bankruptcy court judge overruled the creditor concerns and granted it an extension, but that extension has since run out.   The bankrupt company, which can ask for multiple extensions of its exclusivity right, has already asked the court for its second extension. The extension was initially due to be discussed at a hearing on Tuesday but is now scheduled to be considered by Judge Sean Lane at an Oct. 11 hearing.

37,MET,INSIGHT-Fed's new rate policy twists insurers into a knot," * Operation Twist seen depressing already low returns   * Insurers stuck with fixed payouts on policies, annuities   * Earnings could be pressured for years   By Ben Berkowitz   NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve’s latest move to stimulate credit for consumers and businesses, known as Operation Twist, is likely to threaten the earnings of some of the country’s largest insurers for years to come.   Wall Street in the past week has dimmed its view of MetLife (MET.N), Prudential Financial (PRU.N) and other big insurers, forecasting that they will have to cope with low rates and weak market returns through the end of 2011 and possibly well beyond.   The problem is that returns on insurers’ investment portfolios can’t keep pace with the obligations they have accumulated from torrid sales of annuities and life policies over the past few years.   “Ultimately I think it’s going to be a challenge to business models,” said Gregory Staples, co-head of U.S. fixed income portfolio management at Deutsche Insurance Asset Management (DBKGn.DE), the world’s largest asset manager for insurers.    Insurers were demonstrating sound financial management in purchasing long-term bonds with the premiums they collected to balance their long-term obligations. But if the Fed’s Operation Twist is successfully executed it will push long-term rates lower and, according to some experts, force insurers to retrench on product sales.   No one is suggesting Twist will put insurers out of business, but it is exacerbating a problem that they have been contending with since the financial crisis of 2008.   Under Operation Twist, as announced Wednesday, the Federal Reserve sell shorter-term notes to buy longer-dates Treasuries. That will have the effect of keeping longer-term interest rates down, which the Fed hopes will spur consumers to borrow and spend.   “Folks have brought the low interest-rate environment up to No. 1 priority,” said Doug French, managing principal of the insurance and actuarial advisory practice at Ernst & Young. “We’re not going to get any relief from interest rates for the next two to three years.”   The accounting firm has modeled the investment return needs of the 25 largest life insurers over the next three years to determine what will happen if rates remain static or fall further.   “Their general account yields (in aggregate) are going to decrease by about 51 basis points over the next three years, and that’s a cumulative effect,” French said. “The life industry is under spread compression. It’s just going to continue, and, in fact, it’s going to get worse.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Graphic: stocks and yields    r.reuters.com/fup83s  Operation Twist coverage                  [ID:nS1E78J25W]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   Annuities, a little understood but increasingly popular alternative for older Americans, are a paradoxical problem for insurers when rates plummet.   Limra, a marketing and research group for life insurers, estimates that 35 percent of U.S. retirees receive income from annuities. MetLife, the largest life insurer in the United States, reported that annuity sales rose 48 percent in this year’s second quarter.   Many of the products are sold with a guaranteed minimum benefit in return for an upfront payment. That means that regardless of the strength or weakness of the markets, the insurer has to write a check that doesn’t vary throughout the life of the product.   And that life is getting longer. Several insurers late last year warned that people were holding on to their annuities rather than cashing them out to invest in higher-return products. That creates a bigger nut for the insurers at a time when markets and the central bank aren’t cooperating.   “Once you get a little further out, there’s a very strong consensus that interest rates need to rise,” said JMP Securities analyst Matt Carletti. He and others said insurers are resigning themselves to anemic rates of return.   “Everybody expects a rise in interest rates but few expect it to happen any time soon,” Carletti said.   Rates on 10-year U.S. Treasuries prior to the Fed’s announcement were about 40 basis points below their previous 60-year low and almost two percentage points below their trailing five-year average, according to research from Oppenheimer.   Travelers Companies (TRV.N) said earlier this month that 10 percent of its long-term fixed income investments mature annually through 2014 at an approximate yield of 5 percent. If Travelers reinvests that in Treasuries, the yield is likely to be two to three percentage points lower.   The prospect of anemic returns may be one reason why insurance shares .GSPINSC have underperformed the broader market .GSPC in six of the last seven months.   Shares were broadly lower after the Fed’s announcement.   Several insurers that were hoping for moderate interest-rate relief by now may consider higher-risk investment alternatives eventually, though not yet.   Deutsche IAM said some insurance clients have been seeking to invest in bank loans and other alternatives to traditional stocks and bonds if they could find yields higher than 3 percent, though their appetite has cooled.   “With the recent volatility in the marketplace and the recent sell-off and concern about risk there’s been a bit of a pullback in the interest in those asset classes,” Deutsche’s Staples said.   Most everyone agrees that insurers can sustain themselves during a prolonged period of low rates and meet their obligations through their cash flow rather than investment returns. But the question is what happens if rates do not rise in a few years.   “Let’s say, hypothetically, you’re in a low interest rate environment for the next five to 10 years, you’d have to say you’ve got to change your product mix, you’ve got to change what you’re selling,” Ernst & Young’s French said.

38,MET,Euro zone lenders dominate UK property-Savills," LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Three quarters of banks actively lending for bigger-ticket UK commercial property deals in the quarter to end-September are based in the euro zone, with UK lenders and insurance companies likely to play a greater role, research showed.	   William Newsom, UK head of valuation at consultant Savills  , said 12 of the 16 lenders active in the UK commercial property market were based in the euro zone. 	   “The last three months have been a period of considerable volatility across all the financial markets, with a particular focus on the future of the euro zone,” he said, referring also to the introduction of new Solvency II and Basel III capital adequacy rules for the insurance and banking industries in 2013 as well as to Greece’s economic woes.   	   “Once the way forward is clearer, I am expecting some of the euro zone lenders to be replaced by UK lenders (despite the Vickers report) and others by insurance companies benefiting from Solvency II,” he said in a statement.	   The Independent Commission on Banking’s Vickers Report on UK banking made several recommendations for change in the wake of the global financial crisis, including that UK banks should ringfence their retail business from their investment banking arms. 	   Meanwhile, Newsom said there was increasing activity from lenders such as Handelsbanken, Clydesdale , Coutts, HSBC , and Nationwide Building Society (POB_p.L).

39,MET,MetLife to take up to $275 million in third-quarter charges,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N), the largest life insurer in the United States, said on Thursday it would take up to $275 million in third-quarter charges, in part to increase reserves for policies where it may know the holder is dead but no claim has been filed.  Earlier this year, California regulators subpoenaed the company on its practices related to benefits payouts. The subpoena was spurred by an audit that the state said showed MetLife failed to pay even when it knew the insured was dead.  In particular, regulators nationwide have been looking into industry use of the Social Security Administration’s “Death Master File,” amid claims that companies used the list to end annuity payments but not to find and pay policyholders.  MetLife said it would take an after-tax charge of $115 million to $135 million to adjust reserves for cases where benefits may be payable.  It also forecast charges of $80 million to $100 million for catastrophe losses in its auto and home business — more than twice what it had expected for the period. Like other insurers, the company blamed the impact of late August’s Hurricane Irene, the first hurricane to hit the United States in three years.  In addition, MetLife said it would take a $40 million charge for the liquidation of Executive Life Insurance Company of New York, its share of obligations under industry guaranty agreements. Executive Life went into rehabilitation in 1991, and New York authorities moved to liquidate it in September.  MetLife is due to report full results for the quarter later this month. Analysts expect it to have been a difficult quarter for the life insurance industry, in particular as weak stock markets and low interest rates hurt investment income.

Dealing with the changing mortgage lending market will divert too many resources from MetLife’s insurance businesses, the company said. MetLife has also said it might sell its depository business and de-register as a bank holding company. MetLife Home Loans will continue to make traditional mortgages while the insurer decides whether to sell the business. The company said it will continue to service its mortgage clients. MetLife Home Loans, a division of MetLife Bank, began making traditional mortgages and reverse mortgages in 2008. A MetLife spokesman said it would continue to offer reverse mortgages, a business many other financial companies are exiting. He added that MetLife is “continuously evaluat(ing) all of our businesses based on market conditions and the regulatory environment.” Regulatory issues are becoming more prominent for MetLife given its potential for being tagged a “systemically important financial institution” by the Financial Stability Oversight Council.

47,MET,HOW TO PLAY IT: Bank investors can play the yield,"THE ISSUE: The Federal Reserve’s rejection of insurance giant MetLife’s request for permission to increase its dividend focuses attention on those banks and insurers that can offer attractive yields and raise payouts. By Sam Forgione Oct 31 (Reuters) - The 2008 financial crisis might be over, but for dividend seekers who want financial stocks payouts there are plenty of reminders. The Fed has not given clear indications for bank stockholders on which banks can pay dividends and most investors don’t know about the Fed’s dividend decision until a bank announces a rejection or denial. Banks that took money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program fund must get clearance from the Fed before doling out dividend payments and dividend increases or making stock buybacks. While last week’s rebuff of MetLife Inc’s stock dividend by the Fed showed that the sector still has problems, there are still options for investors looking for yield in financial stocks: MetLife insisted that it still planned to eventually return more of its earnings to shareholders. The insurer owns a bank subsidiary, which it is actively trying to sell. But that ownership is a key reason the Fed oversees its payout policy. Even so, the Fed move says little about the insurance sector’s financial health. MetLife stock dropped briefly after the Fed news last week but no other insurer in the Standard & Poor’s 500 followed suit. Even MetLife recovered some by the end of the day. “MetLife is the only insurance company structured as a bank holding company,” said Jimmy Bhullar, an insurance company analyst at JPMorgan. That leaves many other options among insurers who aren’t under the Fed’s thumb, Bhullar said. He expects Hartford Financial to raise its dividend in the first quarter of next year, Prudential to raise it in the fourth quarter, and Protective Life to raise it in the second quarter of next year. “The companies are generating free cash flow and have the balance sheet capacity,” Bhullar said. There also are smaller banks with big yields that aren’t beholden to the Fed for payout permission. And experts say there are some banks that took TARP funds that are more likely to get a yes when they ask to increase their dividend. Among them: Bank of Hawaii , People’s United Financial and New York Community Bancorp , according to Erik Oja, a bank stock analyst at S&P; Capital IQ. Oja also forecasts that KeyCorp , PNC Financial Services , US Bancorp and Wells Fargo  will be permitted to raise dividends in March, after their capital plans are submitted to regulators in January and reviewed. He said PNC and KeyCorp have tangible common equity ratios of around 10 percent, and yet PNC’s dividend is 22 percent of expected earnings. KeyCorp’s payout rate is only 13 percent of earnings. Wells Fargo’s “yield is below peers and their capital levels are high,” Oja added, and US Bancorp could increase its 12.5 cents dividend to 15 cents. Preferred stock, debt-like instruments that don’t offer the same price gain opportunity as common shares, but pay generous yields, are another option. Using ETFs to invest in preferred shares can reduce the risk from any one bank hitting regulatory or credit problems. “The banking system doesn’t need to improve for preferred stock ETFs to work: it just can’t get dramatically worse,” Morningstar ETF analyst Timothy Strauts noted. Herb Morgan, chief investment officer of Efficient Market Advisors, favors the iShares S&P; U.S. Preferred Stock Index ETF . The ETF includes in its holdings HSBC Holdings preferred shares, which are yielding 7.6 percent and Barclays Bank preferreds, which are yielding 8.5 percent. “Preferred ETFs have been a great place to wait while the markets recover.

50,MET,UPDATE 2-MetLife to reorganize structure; names interim CFO,"* To reorganize business structure into three geographic regions * CFO William Wheeler named president of the Americas division * Eric Steigerwalt appointed interim CFO Nov 21 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, said it will reorganize its business into three geographic regions, as it focuses on its growing international business, and named a new interim chief financial officer. The company will operate across three new business regions — the Americas, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), and Asia — and each region will have its own president. The reorganization may help MetLife’s U.S. business by bundling it together with Latin America, a region the company has aggressively targeted for growth. By putting the Americas in one business unit, the Latin American operations could offset weakness in its U.S. business, where MetLife faces years of depressed profits from persistently low interest rates. For the September-ended quarter, MetLife’s U.S. business’ operating earnings fell 23 percent to $655 million. International business contributed $578 million in operating earnings during the quarter, up from $189 million a year ago, largely due to its 2010 Alico acquisition, and a strong performance in its Latin American and Asia-Pacific operations. “To reach its full potential, MetLife needs an organizational structure that leverages the best of both MetLife and Alico,” CEO Steven Kandarian said. The change in MetLife’s business also creates a structure that closely matches its international competitors like AIG and AXA SA. “This structure will lay the foundation for a global company. Each of our new regions have both mature and developing markets...At the same time, we will be able to draw on strengths from across each region to drive collaboration and efficiencies,” Kandarian said. William Wheeler, the company’s CFO since 2003, was appointed president of the Americas division. Executive vice president Eric Steigerwalt will serve as the interim CFO. The company said it is looking for a new chief financial officer. MetLife’s shares fell 3 percent to $29.71 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Best Co, the main ratings agency for the insurance industry, said on Tuesday it is doing additional stress testing on insurers given deteriorating conditions in Europe. The agency, which just conducted a similar review two months ago, said it is looking at underwriters’ exposures on a case-by-case basis to see if any have additional risk from the weakening euro zone. Best said life insurers and insurers with large annuity businesses are likely to be the worst hit. It has already identified some companies with “outsize exposure” and is evaluating them for ratings changes. “Beyond the uncertainty as to the near-term performance of the financial markets, the main concern is the absence of a coordinated effort by European leaders to bring a solution to the current crisis,” the agency said in a report. The two U.S. insurers that analysts considered most exposed to Europe from an investment standpoint, MetLife and Aflac , have reduced that exposure substantially this year.

52,MET,"MetLife sees 2012 growth, going back to Fed soon","(Reuters) - MetLife expects operating earnings to rise as much as 7 percent in 2012, the largest life insurer in the United States said on Monday, though its forecasts for the fourth quarter and full-year 2011 were below expectations. The company, whose shares rose 3.7 percent in premarket trading, also expects to go back to regulators next month with a revised plan to return capital to shareholders, after its last one was blocked. MetLife is in the middle of a transformation following its acquisition of Alico in 2010. The company now derives a substantially larger share of its business outside the United States, and much of its growth will come from there as well. The insurer recently reorganized its business units to acknowledge that shift, and it has started spending more aggressively on international branding. MetLife (MET.N) said it expects 2011 operating earnings of $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion, or $4.83 to $4.93 per share; and 2012 operating earnings of $5.1 billion to $5.6 billion, or $4.80 to $5.20 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average expected operating earnings of $4.95 per share in 2011 and $5.10 per share in 2012. “Our outlook for 2012 assumes continued softness in the global economic environment,” MetLife Chief Executive Steve Kandarian said on a conference call with investors and analysts. The 2012 plans also assumes no share buybacks, which would raise earnings per share. Kandarian reiterated MetLife’s belief that it can increase earnings on a yearly basis even in a persistently low interest rate environment, and said he was “frustrated” with the performance of the company’s stock. MetLife shares are down 28.5 percent this year, against a 14 percent decline for closest competitor Prudential Financial (PRU.N) and a 9.9 percent decline for the S&P; insurance index .GSPINSC. Because MetLife is a bank holding company, the Federal Reserve has the power to block the company’s capital plans, which it did in late October. Kandarian said MetLife will go back to the Fed with a new plan in January and hoped to have a response by the end of the first quarter. The company is also continuing plans to sell its banking business and shed its holding company status. MetLife expects to have $6 billion to $7 billion in capital in 2012 for dividends and other actions. Analysts have said they expect MetLife to raise its dividend substantially and buy back at least $1 billion in stock. For the current quarter, the company predicted earnings of $1.16 to $1.26 per share, below the analysts’ consensus of $1.28 per share. Outgoing Chief Financial Officer Bill Wheeler said the company’s earnings would have been 6 cents per share higher but for integration costs and reserve charges.

55,MET,GE jumps into retail banking with MetLife deal,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) agreed to buy life insurer MetLife Inc’s (MET.N) online bank on Tuesday, in a deal that will let GE’s capital arm expand its funding base and lessen reliance on wholesale markets. The speed of the move took some analysts by surprise, as it has only been three weeks since GE said it wanted to start taking bank deposits from consumers. In the wake of the financial crisis, during which GE had to seek a lifeline from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, GE Capital has been trying to diversify its funding base so that it is not so dependent on commercial paper and bond sales. “This acquisition gets GE Capital halfway to the stated (funding) goal, much faster than consensus expectations,” Sterne Agee analyst Ben Elias said in a research note. GE Capital is taking on about $7.5 billion in deposits — just enough to put it in the top 100 banks nationwide, roughly. It tipped its hand clearly earlier this month, when a top executive said the company needed a U.S. retail channel next year. “We’ve got it in other parts of the world. We haven’t done it in this country. We’re going to do that very soon, just to give us more diversification in terms of how we fund the business,” GE Capital Chief Executive Mike Neal said at an investor conference earlier this month. MetLife shares rose 0.6 percent to $31.30 and GE shares fell 0.9 percent to $18.07 in late-afternoon trading Tuesday. For MetLife, the sale is what St. John’s business professor Anthony Sabino described as a “win by subtraction.” The country’s largest life insurer has been trying since July to sell MetLife Bank, its online retail arm, which was a small part of its overall business but which also led to bank holding company oversight from the Federal Reserve. In October the Fed blocked the company from paying a dividend or buying back stock. “This agreement is a significant step toward MetLife’s no longer being a bank holding company,” said MetLife CEO Steven Kandarian in a statement. Kandarian and others have talked of a “level playing field,” where MetLife is regulated as an insurer and not as a bank. “We feel that once MetLife is no longer a (bank holding company) and subject to Fed oversight, it will remove an important overhang and help ‘change the story’ for the stock,” Bernstein analyst Suneet Kamath said in a note. Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close in mid-2012, were not disclosed. Sterne Agee’s Elias estimated GE paid “several multiples” less than the 300 basis points Capital One (COF.N) paid in buying ING’s ING.AS U.S. online deposits. Deutsche Bank was financial adviser to MetLife and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was legal adviser.

56,MET,MetLife says exits forward mortgage business,"BOSTON (Reuters) - MetLife will shut down its mortgage operations, the largest U.S. life insurer said on Tuesday, giving up on the unit three months after it said it would seek a buyer. MetLife has been trying to shed assets like its bank and mortgage operations in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny and focus its operations on insurance and annuities. Last year the Federal Reserve blocked the company from raising its dividend, and most analysts expect it will soon face additional regulatory oversight as a “systemically important” financial firm. In a statement, MetLife said it would no longer accept new applications for forward mortgages, but would honor all commitments for loans in process. MetLife said it would continue with its reverse mortgage business. The company forecast up to $110 million in after-tax costs over the next year for the closure but said there would be no impact on operating earnings. The shutdown of the mortgage business follows the late-December deal to sell its retail banking operations to a unit of General Electric (GE.N). The retail banking business represented less than 2 percent of the company’s operating earnings.

57,MET,REFILE-UPDATE 1-Aviva sells eastern Europe units to Metlife,"* Sells life units in Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania * Part of drive to cut back on its low priority markets * Price not disclosed LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Aviva, Britain’s second-biggest insurer, sold its life insurance operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania to U.S. rival Metlife  as part of a plan to refocus on territories where it makes the most money. The three units account for less than 0.5 percent of group profit and had total assets of 57 million euros ($75 million) at the end of June 2011, Aviva said on Monday without disclosing what price they fetched. Metlife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, said the deal reflected its strategy of “investing and growing in high-potential markets.” “This transaction creates an excellent opportunity to reach more customers with a broader product and service offering,” Michel Khalaf, Metlife’s EMEA president said in a statement. Analysts say central and eastern Europe’s comparatively strong economic growth, coupled with its relatively under-developed retail financial services market, make it one of the world’s most promising regions for insurers, alongside booming south-east Asia. The disposals form part of Aviva’s strategy, launched in November 2010, of withdrawing from territories where it is too small to compete and concentrating on its most profitable operations. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania are among 18 of Aviva’s 30 countries which it has identified as low-priority. Under the plan, the insurer has also sold its RAC roadside recovery business and sharply reduced its stake in Dutch insurer Delta Lloyd. Aviva shares were down 2 percent at 348.85 pence at 0950 GMT, narrowly underperforming the European insurance sector , which was 1.8 percent lower. The stock has fallen 23 percent in the past year, compared with a 17 percent decline for the wider sector.

MetLife reported a net profit of $1.13 billion, or $1.06 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $51 million or 5 cents per share. On an operating basis the company earned $1.31 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average expected earnings of $1.24 per share in the quarter. MetLife said total international sales rose 12 percent and overall premiums and fees rose 23 percent, largely on the late-2010 acquisition of Alico from AIG. Operating earnings rose 4 percent in the U.S. business, in part on a benefit from accounting adjustments. The company also recorded $351 million in derivative gains, against $1.1 billion in losses a year earlier.",2142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/metlife-results/update-1-metlife-profit-soars-on-international-growth-idUSL4E8DE5V820120214
59,MET,"MetLife, tenants of NY's Stuyvesant Town settle lawsuit","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) has agreed to settle a 2007 lawsuit by tenants of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village who claimed they were charged too much rent to live in Manhattan’s largest apartment complex. Settlement terms were not disclosed. MetLife revealed the accord in its annual report filed on Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Alexander Schmidt, a lawyer who represents the tenants, said the accord covers “several thousand” tenants whose rent-regulated apartments were converted to market rents between January 2003 and November 2006. MetLife sold the complex that November for $5.4 billion to a group led by Tishman Speyer Properties LP and a real estate unit of Blackrock Inc. “We’re very pleased with the settlement and we feel that it’s very fair (and) reasonable,” said Schmidt, a partner at Wolf, Haldenstein, Adler, Freeman & Hertz. He said both sides hope to reach a final settlement within 45 days. An accord would require approval by New York State Supreme Court Justice Richard Lowe in Manhattan. CWCapital, a special servicer representing bondholders that now control the complex after Tishman missed a debt payment, have not settled with the tenants, who sought roughly $215 million in their lawsuit. A lawyer for CWCapital did not immediately return a call seeking comment. MetLife spokesman John Calagna said the insurer believes it has set aside enough funds for the settlement. Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village include 56 buildings and roughly 11,200 apartments, and sits on an 80-acre property that overlooks the East River. MetLife, which is based in New York, originally built the project for returning World War II veterans and middle class New Yorkers. In October 2009, the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, ruled that MetLife and the Tishman Speyer-led group illegally raised rents for thousands of tenants. A tenants group, the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenants Association, has been working since November with Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) on a plan to buy the complex. It hopes to convert many apartments in the complex into condominium units and let current tenants buy their apartments or remain rent-regulated. The case is Roberts v.

62,MET,"Citi, MetLife surprise with stress test failures","BOSTON (Reuters) - Citigroup and MetLife led a list of financial institutions that failed the Federal Reserve’s latest round of stress testing Tuesday, a shock result for two companies that were widely expected to return billions of dollars in extra capital to shareholders soon. MetLife, the largest life insurer in the United States, and Citigroup, the nation’s third-largest bank, were among just four of 19 banks that didn’t pass the latest round of tests. Ally Financial and SunTrust also failed the exam, which applied worst-case scenarios through the end of 2013. The three listed companies - Citi, MetLife, and SunTrust - were all down more than 3 percent in after-hours trading. “The initial reaction in the market is rather limited, but I think it is pretty negative that you had four banks fail. Citi and a few of the larger ones - it doesn’t bode well for the banking sector,” said Kathy Lien, director of research for GFT Forex in Jersey City, New Jersey. Citi’s result was a substantial setback, as going into the tests some analysts felt it had a better chance of a positive surprise than any other financial institution. The bank said the Fed objected to its capital return plans but did not object to continuing its current dividend level. It added it plans to submit a new capital plan later this year. “We plan to engage further with the Federal Reserve to understand their new stress loss models. We strongly encourage the public release of these models and the associated benchmarks and assumptions,” Citigroup said. Last October, the Fed blocked MetLife’s capital plans in anticipation of the stress testing. The insurer is regulated as a bank holding company because of its online retail banking operations, though it struck a deal last December to sell them to General Electric Co. In a statement the company condemned the stress tests as inappropriate for an insurance company and out of line with the standards used by its state regulators. “We are deeply disappointed with the Federal Reserve’s announcement,” Chief Executive Steve Kandarian said, adding that MetLife had sought permission for a $2 billion share buy-back and a 49 percent increase in its annual dividend. Both were in line with what analysts had expected the company to pay out. Ally, in a statement, said it supported the idea of stress testing but that the results were “inconsistent” with how the company viewed its situation. “The analysis dramatically overstates potential contingent mortgage risk, especially with respect to new vintages of loans,” the company said in a statement, adding that it also would submit a new capital plan in the near future. SunTrust was the last of the banks to respond, more than three hours after the Fed released the test results. It said its own models were “significantly more favorable” than the Fed’s, and that it expected to beat earnings estimates for the current quarter. While market reaction for the four was negative, some took the contrarian view, arguing that having banks fail was actually a good sign that proved the legitimacy of the testing. European bank stress tests were at one time roundly condemned when many troubled banks end up passing. “There’s so much more credibility when you actually have some of these banks fail the stress tests,” said Keith Davis, a bank analyst and principal at money manager Farr, Miller & Washington. “When you actually have banks submitting capital plans and requests to return capital, and it’s denied, I think that says a lot about ... how aggressive (the Fed) is being in terms of assumptions.” ",3132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-stresstests-failures/citi-metlife-surprise-with-stress-test-failures-idUSBRE82C1H720120313

64,MET,Fed stress tests an investor payday for some,"(Reuters) - Most U.S. banks and their investors responded jubilantly to the Federal Reserve’s release of stress test results on Tuesday, with some announcing plans to raise dividends and spend billions of dollars on share buybacks. The Fed gave passing grades to 15 out of 19 banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co. Among the losers: Citigroup Inc, the nation’s number-three bank, and MetLife Inc, the nation’s largest life insurer. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank and arguably one of the strongest, kicked off the releases by announcing that it had been cleared to raise its dividend by 20 percent and spend as much as $12 billion buying back stock this year and $3 billion more in the first three months of 2013. The announcement, which came 90 minutes before the Fed released the results of the other banks, sent JPMorgan and other bank shares soaring. The KBW Bank Index of large-cap financial stocks, which includes most of the banks taking the stress test, rose 4.6 percent before the market closed, having already gained 15.2 percent this year as of Monday’s close. Banks that did not get the rulings they wanted saw their shares fall after the market closed. Citigroup, for example, lost 3.5 percent in after-hours trading. Because the Federal Reserve had previously said it would announce results on Thursday, it looked as though JPMorgan may have jumped the gun with its announcement. A senior Fed official said the central bank became concerned Monday night that some information may have inadvertently been released. The official also said there was a miscommunication with JPMorgan and that nobody at the company was at fault. A person close to the situation who has not been authorized to speak publicly said leaks about the tests on Monday night prompted the Fed to move up the release to Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT). Then, around noon on Tuesday, there was miscommunication between JPMorgan and the Fed about the hour when JPMorgan would release its statement, the person said. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in JPMorgan’s announcement, “We are pleased to be in a position to increase our dividend and to establish a new equity repurchase program. We expect to generate significant capital and deploy that capital to the benefit of our shareholders.” In contrast, State Street Corp said only that the Fed had not objected to its capital plans and that it would “provide further detail in the morning.” Bank of America, which had said it had not asked for permission to raise its dividend or buy back shares, declined to comment on its results even though it passed the test. Citigroup, which only just missed a passing mark, did not dispute the Fed’s decision and said it would submit a revised proposal later this year. Some analysts had expected Citigroup to win permission to raise its dividend to as much as 10 cents from a penny a share. Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit lamented recently in the company’s annual report that “some of our peers were buoyed by the ability to buy back shares, an option we lacked.” Citigroup investor and hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson said he was surprised that Citi didn’t make the hurdle. “They missed very narrowly, in an extreme stress scenario,” said Tilson. Wells Fargo said it increased its quarterly dividend to 22 cents from 12 cents. The bank also said the Fed approved its capital plan, which includes a higher level of share repurchases in 2012 than in 2011, when it bought back 117 million shares. “Wells Fargo has always managed its business to perform for shareholders through a variety of economic environments and we are pleased that this process again validates the strength of our franchise,” CEO John Stumpf said in written announcement. MetLife said it was “deeply disappointed” with the Fed’s testing, which it said was not suited to an insurance company. Though MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, its small online deposit-taking operation means it is regulated as a bank holding company. The Fed objected to MetLife’s incremental capital distribution plan, which included an increase of the company’s annual stock dividend from $0.74 per share to $1.10 per share, plus $2 billion in stock repurchases. MetLife has said it expected to return capital to shareholders this year, but it purposely left any buybacks out of its 2012 guidance. MetLife stock fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading. Ally Financial, whose common capital score fared the worst of all 19 banks under the Fed’s worst-case scenario, issued a statement criticizing the stress test assumptions. The Detroit-based lender said the Fed’s analysis “dramatically overstates” mortgage risk, particularly for newer loans, and does not reflect management’s ability to deal with risks related to problem loans originated before the financial crisis. The bank also said that the Fed did not give enough weight to additional capital that Ally could use in a stress situation if the Fed allowed it to do so. Ally said it plans to submit a revised capital plan in the near future. SunTrust, the last of the four banks with a capital plan that failed the test, took several hours to issue a statement, during which its shares fell as much as 5.3 percent in extended trading. SunTrust said its own models were “significantly more favorable” than the Fed’s, and that it expected to beat earnings estimates for the current quarter. Morgan Stanley released a statement more than an hour after JPMorgan, but 17 minutes ahead of the Federal Reserve, saying the regulator had no objection to its 2012 capital plan. That plan includes keeping stable its common and preferred dividend payouts, and potentially using cash to buy another 14 percent stake of its Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture with Citigroup. Morgan Stanley has the option to buy that stake in May. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, in a statement after the Fed announcement, said the regulator did not object to its capital plan through the first quarter of 2013. The plan includes stock repurchases and a potential increase to its quarterly common stock dividend, which is currently 35 cents per share. Last year, Goldman spent $6 billion buying back 47 million shares, which is its preferred way of returning capital to shareholders. Management is currently authorized to buy back another 63.5 million shares. Fifth Third Bancorp, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said the Fed objected to its bid to raise its quarterly dividend and spend more for share buybacks than it receives in gains from a potential asset sale. The bank said it will resubmit its plan to the Fed in order to address the regulator’s objections. BB&T; Corp bumped its quarterly dividend by 4 cents to 20 cents per share, and said it received permission to redeem $3.2 billion in trust preferred securities. “We continue to be one of the strongest capitalized institutions in the industry and believe our 2012 capital actions confirm that strength and our commitment to our shareholders,” CEO Kelly King said. PNC Financial Services Group Inc said it received permission to increase its 35-cents-per share quarterly dividend but did not say by how much. Its board is expected to consider an increase in April. The bank also plans modest share repurchases. US Bancorp increased its quarterly dividend by 7 cents to 19.5 cents and its board authorized the repurchase of 100 million of its outstanding shares. “Looking ahead, we continue to see a slow, but steady, economic recovery, and we look forward to participating in the revitalization of our markets, while serving the needs of our customers and, importantly, rewarding our shareholders for their investment in our company,” CEO Richard Davis said. Bank of New York Mellon Corp said the Fed cleared its plan to repurchase $1.16 billion of stock over the next 12 months and maintain its current dividend. Unlike banks eager to pay fatter dividends, Regions Financial Corp said it had launched a $900 million common stock offering as part of a plan to repay $3.5 billion in government bailout dollars. The Alabama-based regional bank said the payback would come after it completes the sale of its Morgan Keegan brokerage unit, pending Federal Reserve and Treasury approval. “We are pleased with the outcome of the capital plan review and believe it demonstrates the strength of our company,” said Regions CEO Grayson Hall. KeyCorp said it would raise its quarterly common stock dividend to 5 cents per share from the current level of 3 cents per share, and begin a $344 million stock buyback program. The Fed did not object to those plans or the possible redemption of certain trust preferred securities, KeyCorp said. American Express Co said it plans to repurchase up to $5 billion worth of stock from now through the first quarter of 2013, and raise its quarterly dividend to 20 cents per share from the current level of 18 cents per share. The Fed did not object to those plans, AmEx said. ",3142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-dividend/fed-stress-tests-an-investor-payday-for-some-idUSBRE82C16B20120314

It said its own models were “significantly more favorable” than the Fed’s, and that it expected to beat earnings estimates for the current quarter. While market reaction for the four was negative, some took the contrarian view, arguing that having banks fail was actually a good sign that proved the legitimacy of the testing. European bank stress tests were at one time roundly condemned when many troubled banks end up passing. “There’s so much more credibility when you actually have some of these banks fail the stress tests,” said Keith Davis, a bank analyst and principal at money manager Farr, Miller & Washington. “When you actually have banks submitting capital plans and requests to return capital, and it’s denied, I think that says a lot about ... how aggressive (the Fed) is being in terms of assumptions.” ",3142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-stresstests-failures/citi-metlife-surprise-with-stress-test-failures-idUSBRE82C1H720120314
66,MET,Fed stress tests an investor payday for some,"(Reuters) - Most  banks and their investors responded jubilantly to the Federal Reserve’s release of stress test results on Tuesday, with some announcing plans to raise dividends and spend billions of dollars on share buybacks. The Fed gave passing grades to 15 out of 19 banks, including JPMorgan Case & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co. Among the losers: Citigroup Inc, the nation’s number-three bank, and MetLife Inc, the nation’s largest life insurer. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank and arguably one of the strongest, kicked off the releases by announcing that it had been cleared to raise its dividend by 20 percent and spend as much as $12 billion buying back stock this year and $3 billion more in the first three months of 2013. The announcement, which came 90 minutes before the Fed released the results of the other banks, sent JPMorgan and other bank shares soaring. The KBW Bank Index of large-cap financial stocks, which includes most of the banks taking the stress test, rose 4.6 percent before the market closed, having already gained 15.2 percent this year as of Monday’s close. Banks that did not get the rulings they wanted saw their shares fall after the market closed. Citigroup, for example, lost 3.5 percent in after-hours trading. Because the Federal Reserve had previously said it would announce results on Thursday, it looked as though JPMorgan may have jumped the gun with its announcement. A senior Fed official said the central bank became concerned Monday night that some information may have inadvertently been released. The official also said there was a miscommunication with JPMorgan and that nobody at the company was at fault. A person close to the situation who has not been authorized to speak publicly said leaks about the tests on Monday night prompted the Fed to move up the release to Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT). Then, around noon on Tuesday, there was miscommunication between JPMorgan and the Fed about the hour when JPMorgan would release its statement, the person said. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in JPMorgan’s announcement, “We are pleased to be in a position to increase our dividend and to establish a new equity repurchase program. We expect to generate significant capital and deploy that capital to the benefit of our shareholders.” In contrast, State Street Corp said only that the Fed had not objected to its capital plans and that it would “provide further detail in the morning.” Bank of America, which had said it had not asked for permission to raise its dividend or buy back shares, declined to comment on its results even though it passed the test. Citigroup, which only just missed a passing mark, did not dispute the Fed’s decision and said it would submit a revised proposal later this year. Some analysts had expected Citigroup to win permission to raise its dividend to as much as 10 cents from a penny a share. Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit lamented recently in the company’s annual report that “some of our peers were buoyed by the ability to buy back shares, an option we lacked.” Citigroup investor and hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson said he was surprised that Citi didn’t make the hurdle. “They missed very narrowly, in an extreme stress scenario,” said Tilson. Wells Fargo said it increased its quarterly dividend to 22 cents from 12 cents. The bank also said the Fed approved its capital plan, which includes a higher level of share repurchases in 2012 than in 2011, when it bought back 117 million shares. “Wells Fargo has always managed its business to perform for shareholders through a variety of economic environments and we are pleased that this process again validates the strength of our franchise,” CEO John Stumpf said in written announcement. MetLife said it was “deeply disappointed” with the Fed’s testing, which it said was not suited to an insurance company. Though MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, its small online deposit-taking operation means it is regulated as a bank holding company. The Fed objected to MetLife’s incremental capital distribution plan, which included an increase of the company’s annual stock dividend from $0.74 per share to $1.10 per share, plus $2 billion in stock repurchases. MetLife has said it expected to return capital to shareholders this year, but it purposely left any buybacks out of its 2012 guidance. MetLife stock fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading. Ally Financial, whose common capital score fared the worst of all 19 banks under the Fed’s worst-case scenario, issued a statement criticizing the stress test assumptions. The Detroit-based lender said the Fed’s analysis “dramatically overstates” mortgage risk, particularly for newer loans, and does not reflect management’s ability to deal with risks related to problem loans originated before the financial crisis. The bank also said that the Fed did not give enough weight to additional capital that Ally could use in a stress situation if the Fed allowed it to do so. Ally said it plans to submit a revised capital plan in the near future. SunTrust, the last of the four banks with a capital plan that failed the test, took several hours to issue a statement, during which its shares fell as much as 5.3 percent in extended trading. SunTrust said its own models were “significantly more favorable” than the Fed’s, and that it expected to beat earnings estimates for the current quarter. Morgan Stanley released a statement more than an hour after JPMorgan, but 17 minutes ahead of the Federal Reserve, saying the regulator had no objection to its 2012 capital plan. That plan includes keeping stable its common and preferred dividend payouts, and potentially using cash to buy another 14 percent stake of its Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture with Citigroup. Morgan Stanley has the option to buy that stake in May. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, in a statement after the Fed announcement, said the regulator did not object to its capital plan through the first quarter of 2013. The plan includes stock repurchases and a potential increase to its quarterly common stock dividend, which is currently 35 cents per share. Last year, Goldman spent $6 billion buying back 47 million shares, which is its preferred way of returning capital to shareholders. Management is currently authorized to buy back another 63.5 million shares. Fifth Third Bancorp, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said the Fed objected to its bid to raise its quarterly dividend and spend more for share buybacks than it receives in gains from a potential asset sale. The bank said it will resubmit its plan to the Fed in order to address the regulator’s objections. BB&T; Corp bumped its quarterly dividend by 4 cents to 20 cents per share, and said it received permission to redeem $3.2 billion in trust preferred securities. “We continue to be one of the strongest capitalized institutions in the industry and believe our 2012 capital actions confirm that strength and our commitment to our shareholders,” CEO Kelly King said. PNC Financial Services Group Inc said it received permission to increase its 35-cents-per share quarterly dividend but did not say by how much. Its board is expected to consider an increase in April. The bank also plans modest share repurchases. US Bancorp increased its quarterly dividend by 7 cents to 19.5 cents and its board authorized the repurchase of 100 million of its outstanding shares. “Looking ahead, we continue to see a slow, but steady, economic recovery, and we look forward to participating in the revitalization of our markets, while serving the needs of our customers and, importantly, rewarding our shareholders for their investment in our company,” CEO Richard Davis said. Bank of New York Mellon Corp said the Fed cleared its plan to repurchase $1.16 billion of stock over the next 12 months and maintain its current dividend. Unlike banks eager to pay fatter dividends, Regions Financial Corp said it had launched a $900 million common stock offering as part of a plan to repay $3.5 billion in government bailout dollars. The Alabama-based regional bank said the payback would come after it completes the sale of its Morgan Keegan brokerage unit, pending Federal Reserve and Treasury approval. “We are pleased with the outcome of the capital plan review and believe it demonstrates the strength of our company,” said Regions CEO Grayson Hall. KeyCorp said it would raise its quarterly common stock dividend to 5 cents per share from the current level of 3 cents per share, and begin a $344 million stock buyback program. The Fed did not object to those plans or the possible redemption of certain trust preferred securities, KeyCorp said. American Express Co said it plans to repurchase up to $5 billion worth of stock from now through the first quarter of 2013, and raise its quarterly dividend to 20 cents per share from the current level of 18 cents per share. The Fed did not object to those plans, AmEx said. ",3142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-dividend/fed-stress-tests-an-investor-payday-for-some-idUSBRE82D04620120314
67,MET,Factbox: How the 19 banks fared in stress tests,"(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that 15 of the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies passed this year’s stress tests, meaning they would maintain a Tier 1 common equity ratio above 5 percent in a severe economic downturn. The four companies that did not pass were Ally Financial, SunTrust Banks Inc, Citigroup Inc, and MetLife Inc, which failed because its minimum risk-based capital ratio, at 6 percent, was far lower than any other bank in the exams. The company said the Fed’s standards were too “bank-centric” and not appropriate for insurers. Here is a list of the 19 banks, their minimum capital ratios through 2013 under the test (including capital proposed by the banks) and whether the banks announced they had received approval from the Fed for dividend increases and/or share repurchase plans.

68,MET,Fed revises stress test losses,"* Fed makes slight changes to stress test calculations * Changes affect BofA, Citigroup, Ally Financial, Metlife, Wells Fargo * Capital ratios not affected under stress scenario By Alexandra Alper WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve bank said on Friday it had made mistakes in calculating bank losses in stress test results released this week. But the Federal Reserve noted the revisions — which affect Citigroup, Bank of America, and three others — have no effect on key figures like capital ratios, which estimate how bank reserves would fare under scenarios imagined by the tests, which include skyrocketing unemployment, a tanking market and a deep recession. In results first released on Tuesday, the Fed gave glowing marks to most of the large banks, passing 15 out of 19 tested, and underscoring the recovery of the financial sector. But the central bank called out a few laggards, including Citigroup, forcing it and others to revise planned share buybacks and dividends. In revised figures released on Friday, the Fed reduced Citi’s losses on first lien mortgages from $9.3 billion to $8.9 billion under the stressed scenario. The change occurred after the Fed decided to remove foreign mortgages from that calculation. Citi representatives were not immediately available for comment. The other banks affected by the revisions are Ally Financial , Metlife, and Wells Fargo. Citigroup, Ally Financial, Metlife and Sun Trust  found themselves at the bottom of the stress test heap on Tuesday. Overall, for the 19 banks, the Fed’s revisions slightly decreased losses on first lien mortgages from $61.5 billion to $61.1 billion. The calculations were based on estimated losses sustained by banks during a 27-month period in which unemployment hit 13 percent and housing prices drop by 21 percent. The bank holding companies whose balance sheets weathered the hypothetical storm best were Bank of New York Mellon with a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 13.1 percent, State Street Corp with 12.5 percent and American Express with 10.8 percent.",3172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/financial-regulation-stress-test/fed-revises-stress-test-losses-idUSL2E8EH03120120317

In slides filed with securities regulators ahead of their presentation at a UBS conference, Eric Steigerwalt said MetLife’s own calculations put it well above what the Fed required in its most recent stress testing. The Fed blocked the insurer’s capital plans because its risk-based capital ratio was less than the central bank required.",3232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/metlife/metlife-plans-to-drop-bank-status-soon-cfo-idUSL1E8EN1S620120323
70,MET,Potential bidders line up ING's Asia arms -sources,"HONG KONG, March 26 (Reuters) - Insurers including MetLife  and Manulife are hiring banks to advise them on a potential purchase of the Asian insurance and asset management arms of Dutch bancassurer ING Groep. MetLife has hired Credit Suisse, according to sources familiar with the situation. Canada’s Manulife, whose potential interest in bidding was reported by Reuters in January, has hired Citigroup as an adviser, other sources familiar with the situation said. ING, Credit Suisse and Citi declined to comment. Manulife and MetLife were not immediately available to comment. ING must spin off its insurance and investment management operations by the end of 2013 in return for European Commission approval for 10 billion euros ($13.26 billion) of Dutch state aid received in 2008. A recent EU court ruling may give ING leeway on smaller sales, but it is still expected to move ahead with its divestments. The auction is drawing interest from U.S., Canadian, European and Asian companies. These include Prudential Financial, Sun Life Financial, AIA Group Ltd, South Korea’s KB Financial Group, KB Life Insurance and Samsung Life, and some Japanese insurers. The Wall Street Journal on Sunday night was first to report MetLife’s interest, and that MetLife and Manulife had hired banks. Bloomberg, which followed with its own story, said Banca Generali SpA and Great Eastern Holdings were also showing interest. Generali said it would not comment on market rumours. Great Eastern was not immediately available for comment. Based on Great Eastern’s small market capitalisation, it is unlikely to be a bidder unless ING were to sell its Asian assets separately. ING has operations in seven Asian markets; China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand. Japan and South Korea are more mature, slower-growth markets and may be sold separately. ING is also expected to sell its three Asian insurance joint ventures separately so that the overall sale will not be held up by negotiations with partners. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are advising ING on the sale of its Asian operations. On Friday, sources told Reuters that ING had hired an investment bank to help find a buyer for its stake in TMB Bank Pcl. ING is due to send out detailed information to potential bidders in April. Bidders will use that information to construct their own valuation models. At the end of last year, ING valued its Asia-Pacific insurance operations at 5.8 billion euros, with an additional 300 million euros from the investment management business being attributed to Asia, according to an analyst presentation on ING’s website.

71,MET,TEXT-S&P;: MetLife Alico Japan assigned 'A+' ratings,"— We have assigned our ‘A+’ financial strength and long-term counterparty credit ratings and ‘A-1’ short-term counterparty credit rating to MetLife Alico Life Insurance KK (MetLife Alico Japan). — The ratings reflect the insurer’s strong stand-alone credit profile and its role within American Life Insurance Co. (Alico) and MetLife Inc. (MET). MET acquired Alico in 2010. We view MetLife Alico Japan as a core entity of Alico as well as a strategically important entity of MET, given its large contributions to the MET group and the group’s strong commitment to the entity. — In our view, MetLife Alico Japan has a strong competitive position in the Japanese life insurance market. It has a strong distribution network and good product diversification. It also has strong earnings on relatively low-risk products and adequate capitalization relative to the risks it assumes. — The positive outlook reflects the possibility that we may come to view MetLife Alico Japan as a core entity of the MET group upon its successful integration into the group. TOKYO (Standard & Poor’s) March 26, 2012—Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said today that it has assigned its ‘A+’ financial strength and long-term counterparty credit ratings and ‘A-1’ short-term counterparty credit rating to MetLife Alico Life Insurance KK (MetLife Alico Japan). The outlook on the ratings is positive. MetLife Alico Japan will start operations as the Japanese subsidiary of American Life Insurance Co. (Alico; A+/Positive/—) on April 2, 2012. It will take on the insurance policy liabilities of a Japanese branch of Alico by the end of May 2012. The ratings reflect our assumption that MetLife Alico Japan will successfully begin operations on April 2, 2012, and adequate capital will be injected into the new subsidiary by that date. The ratings reflect MetLife Alico Japan’s important role within the MET group’s international strategy. Based on our group methodology, we view MetLife Alico Japan as a core entity of Alico and a strategically important subsidiary of MetLife Inc. (MET; A-/Negative/A-2). MetLife Alico Japan operates businesses that are integral to the MET group’s strategy, and it contributes to the group’s sales and earnings. We believe the MET group is strongly committed to Alico, particularly to MetLife Alico Japan as it makes up a significant part of Alico’s capital and earnings. This can be seen from the large acquisition costs that the group incurred for Alico; the subsequent strategic restructuring of Alico entities, including MetLife Alico Japan; and the progress made in integrating Alico’s key areas, such as investments and enterprise risk management, into the MET group. The ratings on MetLife Alico Japan also reflect the company’s strong stand-alone credit profile. In our view, MetLife Alico Japan has a strong competitive position in Japan’s life insurance market. It has a diversified distribution network and good product diversification, as well as strong earnings from relatively low-risk products. We also believe that the new subsidiary is likely to be adequately capitalized relative to the risks it assumes. The positive outlook on the ratings on MetLife Alico Japan reflects our expectation that we will consider this subsidiary to be a core entity of the MET group upon its full and successful integration into the group. When that happens, we expect to align the ratings on MetLife Alico Japan with those on the core operating entities of the MET group, which are currently ‘AA-‘. We revised our outlook on Alico to positive in November 2010 when MET acquired Alico to reflect the possibility that we may view Alico as a core entity of the MET group in a relatively short period (for more details, please see “American Life Insurance Co. Outlook Revised To Positive After Being Acquired By MetLife Inc.,” published on Nov. 1, 2010). We will review MetLife Alico Japan’s group status, based on the progress of Alico’s restructuring and integration into the MET group. If MetLife Alico Japan is fully integrated into the operations of the MET group, leading us to view it as a core entity of the group, we may raise the ratings on MetLife Alico Japan. We may also raise the ratings if we upgrade the core operating entities of the MET group—even if MetLife Alico Japan were to keep its current group status within the MET group. However, the ratings and outlook on MetLife Alico Japan will be constrained by the sovereign ratings on Japan (AA-/Negative/A-1+), given that its operations and asset concentration are in Japan. Conversely, we may downgrade MetLife Alico Japan if we lower the ratings on MET’s core operating companies and if MetLife Alico Japan were to keep its current group status within the MET group.

75,MET,"MetLife in multistate deal over ""Death Master"" use","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc, the largest life insurer in the United States, will pay nearly $500 million to settle a multistate investigation into unpaid claims for dead policy holders, state regulators and the company said on Monday. The investigation related to the use of the Social Security “Death Master” file, which lists people who have recently died. A number of states have accused insurers of using the list to stop making annuity payments to dead customers, but at the same time not using the list to check whether any life insurance policy holders had passed away. The settlement follows a similar deal that Prudential Financial, the country’s second-largest life insurer, struck with 20 states in January. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, on a conference call to discuss the MetLife investigation, said there are still eight Death Master probes under way and that it is hoping for settlements in those cases like the MetLife and Prudential deals. One state official said those two deals could force other companies’ hands. “We’re hopeful that this MetLife settlement is going to dislodge a stone,” Adam Cole, the general counsel of the California Department of Insurance, said in an interview. “They have differing stances. We really do hope that with both Prudential and MetLife, the other companies will realize it’s important to enter into these agreements.” A spokesman for MetLife said its settlement contemplates $438 million in payments to policyholders and beneficiaries, plus $40 million in settlement costs, for a total approaching $500 million. In a statement, MetLife said $188 million in payments will be made this year and the rest over the next 17 years. The company is fully reserved for the deal, having topped up the reserve in the first quarter of this year. “The company has been working with regulators to develop industry best practices and is pleased to announce new processes that will provide an even stronger safety net for the limited number of beneficiaries who do not submit a claim to the company in the normal course of business,” the company said. The deal requires MetLife to restore the full value of any account that was improperly drawn down, comply with state unclaimed property laws and pay 3 percent compounded interest on amounts that had been held back, starting with either the date of the policy owner’s death or January 1, 1995, whichever came later. The company said it has set up an online system to help people track down policies. It also said it is contacting older policyholders, many of whom took out their insurance without providing a Social Security number or date of birth, and in some cases will offer them an accelerated payout on the policy. MetLife shares were up 1.1 percent at $35.34 in afternoon trading. The lead states on the MetLife deal were California, Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. Separately from the MetLife deal, earlier on Monday New York officials said their own probe into Death Master abuses had led insurers to make more than $260 million in payments to policy beneficiaries who may not have been aware they had money due to them.

78,MET,Wal-Mart's Castro-Wright quits MetLife board,"(Reuters) - Embattled Wal-Mart vice chairman Eduardo Castro-Wright has resigned from the board of MetLife, the largest life insurer in the United States, the company said on Tuesday. “Over the past weekend, I notified you of recent events that will require my immediate and personal attention,” Castro-Wright said in a letter to MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steve Kandarian, a copy of which was filed with securities regulators. “Accordingly, I now must focus my energy in spending personal time with my family and in protecting my good name and business reputation,” he added at the end of the letter. Castro-Wright was named in a weekend New York Times report as a key figure in an alleged foreign bribery scandal at Wal-Mart.

81,MET,MetLife posts loss on interest rate bet,"(Reuters) - MetLife (MET.N), the largest life insurer in the United States, posted a net loss for the first quarter on huge derivative losses tied to a rise in interest rates. But operating results beat expectations on growth in all three of its geographic regions. MetLife accidentally released preliminary figures last week, so the broad outlines of results were already known. The company said on Thursday it lost $174 million, or 16 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $701 million or 66 cents per share. On an operating basis MetLife earned $1.37 per share. Before the accidental release last week, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected earnings of $1.25 per share. MetLife said it had $1.3 billion in derivative losses in the quarter. The company uses derivatives to hedge changes in interest rates; during the quarter, yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries rose nearly 34 basis points. Operating earnings grew by double digits in both the U.S. life and annuity business and in the benefits segment. International growth was strongest, though, as operating earnings rose 22 percent in Latin America and 33 percent in Asia. International results have become increasingly important for MetLife since it acquired Alico from AIG in November 2010, substantially changing the company’s mix of domestic versus overseas operations. The derivative loss is the latest high-profile headline for MetLife, which butted heads with the Federal Reserve earlier this year over now-blocked plans to raise its dividend and buy back shares. Earlier on Thursday, MetLife said it would stop selling reverse mortgages, cutting 500 jobs in the process. The company had been by far the largest in that industry, with a market share this year of about 23 percent. On Tuesday, board member Eduardo Castro-Wright resigned amid a growing scandal over alleged bribe payments by businesses he oversaw for Wal-Mart (WMT.N). On Monday, the company said it would pay nearly $500 million to end a multistate probe into its use of the Social Security “Death Master” file, after an investigation into whether it was doing enough to find dead policyholders.

83,MET,MetLife exits reverse mortgage business,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer and reverse mortgage lender, made a surprise shift on Thursday with the sale its reverse mortgage business as part of its exit from banking-related activities. Nationstar Mortgage LLC will buy its reverse mortgage servicing portfolio, and MetLife Bank would not accept any new applications, the company said. A Metlife spokesman said about 500 jobs are expected to be cut as a result of the sale. MetLife has been actively shedding its banking and mortgage operations to drop its bank holding company charter and thereby limit U.S. regulation. But as recently as January it said it would continue writing reverse mortgages. According to market data company Reverse Mortgage Insight, MetLife Bank was by far the biggest U.S. reverse mortgage lender in the first quarter, with 23 percent of the market. At the same time, the industry has been shrinking, with volume in March at close to a 7-year low, RMI said. MetLife stopped taking applications for traditional mortgages earlier this year, and struck a deal last year to sell MetLife Bank’s deposit business to General Electric Co’s GE Capital. Earlier this year, because of the oversight role it has through the company’s bank charter, the Federal Reserve blocked MetLife from raising its dividend or buying back shares, amid concerns about some of its capital ratios. MetLife executives have said they would seek to drop the charter as soon as MetLife Bank’s operations were sold, and to raise the dividend and buy back shares thereafter.

87,MET,UPDATE 3-MetLife not rushing to return capital,"* Still working to shed bank charter * SIFI status needs to be considered - CEO * CFO expects up to $7 bln in ready capital by year-end By Ben Berkowitz April 27 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc will need to “examine a range of factors” once it sheds its bank holding company status before it can decide on returning capital to shareholders, the chief executive of the largest U.S. life insurer said on Friday. The comments may have dashed some investors’ hopes that the company could start buying back shares and paying a richer dividend as soon as July, though MetLife said it remains committed to returning capital at some point. Shares fell more than 2 percent in morning trading, even as S&P; Capital IQ upgraded the shares to “buy” on valuation. The Federal Reserve has twice blocked MetLife from raising its dividend and buying back shares in recent months, and the company is now selling off and shutting down businesses so it can shed the bank charter. Some analysts had expected the company to return capital as soon as the bank charter was out of the way. But MetLife said Friday there were other considerations as well, including whether the company is designated a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. “It’s a difficult environment from which to operate, from the point of view of providing clarity and certainty to our shareholders at this very moment on our capital plans,” CEO Steve Kandarian said on a conference call with analysts. He said the company was adamant the rules must be “tailored” to match standards usually used for insurers and not banks. The council’s decision is pending, and while the insurance industry has fought hard to make the case that insurers are not systemically important, most analysts and investors expect MetLife, and possibly a few others, to be tagged as nonbank SIFIs. “Those things are still a moving target. To date, no one’s been designated yet a nonbank SIFI, so we have to wait and see more on that,” Kandarian said. There were timing questions about the bank charter as well. 	 Kandarian, asked whether MetLife was still hoping to close the sale of its deposit-taking business to General Electric  by the end of the second quarter, said he couldn’t be certain because it was in regulators’ hands. It was that second-quarter estimate that had led some to assume the buybacks could begin starting immediately after, in July or thereabouts. “We view (MetLife’s) business mix and geographic reach as attractive, but note execution risk remains as MET seeks to exit banking and mortgage operations,” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said in a research note. Either way, interim Chief Financial Officer Eric Steigerwalt said the company expected to have $6 billion to $7 billion of deployable capital by the end of the year, before taking into account any changes in dividend or share buybacks. A number of analysts queried whether some of that money might be used for acquisitions, but Kandarian was cautious, saying any deal had to be a better use of capital than a buyback and had to almost immediately add to earnings. “I’d say that right after the start of the crisis it was very much a buyers’ market and ... now it’s more of a neutral market. It’s not like 2006, 2007 where it was clearly a sellers’ market,” he said, adding that MetLife is seeing a number of what it considers distressed sellers coming to market with properties they want to offload to repair their balance sheets. MetLife shares fell 2.2 percent to $35.65 in morning trading. Through Thursday’s close, the stock was up 17 percent for the year, against 11 percent gains for the S&P; insurance sector. But the stock is off nearly 10 percent since a recent high on March 13, and Seifert said it now looks undervalued relative to peers. On Thursday afternoon, the company reported a net loss for the first quarter after losing $1.3 billion on derivatives used to hedge changes in interest rates. It was the latest in a week of high-profile headlines for the insurer. Earlier on Thursday, MetLife said it would stop selling reverse mortgages, cutting 500 jobs in the process. The company had been by far the largest in that industry, with a market share this year of about 23 percent.

95,MET,"Manulife, Metlife submit bids for ING Asia sale: sources","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Manulife Financial Corp (MFC.TO) and Metlife (MET.N) are among the companies that have submitted first round bids for ING’s entire Asia life insurance business, sources said on Saturday, in what could be the largest Asia M&A; insurance deal ever. ING’s long awaited sale of Asian life insurance and the asset management units will help the Dutch bancassurer to partly repay the 3 billion euros ($3.81 billion) of state aid plus the 50 percent premium it still owes the Dutch government. The bids were submitted late on Friday and the indicative offers ranged between 6-7 billion euros ($7.6-$8.9 billion), according to one source with knowledge of the matter. Of the eight to 10 companies that sent offers, a shortlist will emerge by the end of May, the source said, adding that five bidders expressed interest for the whole Asia division while the rest sought parts of the business. Still, some suitors have developed cold feet, as demonstrated by Samsung Life Insurance’s (032830.KS) decision on Thursday to pull out of the race at the last minute. South Korea’s Kyobo Life has also dropped out, and it was also unclear whether Prudential Financial Corp (PRU.N) took part in the first round. Prudential Financial was seen as one of the strongest contenders to buy the whole Asian unit, and its absence from the process could be a setback to competitive dynamics of the auction, sources said. A sale topping $7 billion would rank as Asia’s top insurance M&A; deal and add to a flurry of financial institutions deals being launched in Asia this year. After receiving a government bailout in 2008, ING has sold 15.2 billion euros worth of assets across the world. The Asian sales would figure among the top two deals from ING’s stable. Asian insurer AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK) and Korea’s KB Financial Group (105560.KS) also submitted first round bids, sources said. Korea Life Insurance Co (088350.KS), Canada’s Sun Life Financial Inc (SLF.TO), and Switzerland’s Zurich Insurance Group ZURN.VX, were also expected to submit offers. U.S. private equity fund J.C. Flowers & Co, TPG TPG.UL and Carlyle Group are among the buyout shops that have expressed interest, though they are expected to team up with a bidder to buy the Japanese business rather than bid on their own, sources said. The sources declined to be identified because details of the auction process remain confidential. ING declined to comment. Companies mentioned in this report either could not be reached for comment, or declined to comment. As part of the Asian divestment, ING received about 10 initial bids for its Asian asset management business this week. The asset management business, expected to fetch between $500 million and $600 million, is being sold separately. ING had sent out more than a dozen information memorandums for its insurance business, which spans southeast Asia and includes operations in Japan and South Korea. A winning bid by a larger insurer could introduce more competition into Asia’s rapidly growing life insurance market, currently dominated by AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK) and British insurer Prudential plc (PRU.L). ING’s Asian operations offer a platform for insurers keen to expand their Asian footprint and tap into the region’s rapid premium growth. Life insurance premiums in emerging Asia are forecast to grow at 9.5 percent this year and 8.7 percent next year, nearly three times the world average, according to Swiss Re estimates. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity which many CEOs will find hard to let go,” said one banker who is advising a potential buyer. ING CEO Jan Hommen said last week that the Asian divestments would probably fetch less than 8 billion euros ($10.2 billion). A deal would need to surpass $7.06 billion to become Asia’s biggest insurance deal and overtake Australian fund manager AMP’s (AMP.AX) 2011 purchase of AXA’s Australian unit, Thomson Reuters data shows. Most buyers are likely to place aggressive bids in the first round in order to advance to the second round. But the deal has its own challenges and not all bidders are keen to lay their hands on the entire Asian pie. Potential buyers are most wary of ING’s Japan insurance business due to uncertainty over liabilities arising from variable annuity products on its books there. ING’s Southeast Asian operations are the most sought after, sources said. ING has indicated that it prefers bids for the whole Asian business, though it is allowing offers for three geographic regions: Southeast Asia, South Korea and Japan. ING has prohibited bidders from forming consortiums in the first round though those who move into the second round could join hands and break up the asset. ING’s decision to invite bids for geographic portions as well as its entire Asia operations is designed to enhance bid competition and maximise sale value, sources said. ING plans to hold management presentations for the shortlisted bidder by mid-June sources added. The sources were not authorized to speak to the media. All companies mentioned in this report either declined to comment or could not be reached for comment. ING operates across seven Asian centres. Profits from its Asia-Pacific insurance operations rose 39 percent in the first quarter of 2012 from a year ago to 218 million euros ($282.2 million), according to the latest company filings. South Korea and Japan accounted for 77 percent of the profits while Malaysia accounted for 10 percent. Japan accounted for about 45 percent of Asia-Pacific’s underlying profit before tax, followed by South Korea and Malaysia. For investment banks starved of IPOs and M&A; deals, ING’s Asian divestment could provide a much needed boost. Bankers and lawyers stand to earn about $100 million in fees if the deal is completed, some sources said. By winning the sell-side mandate, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) are best-placed to earn a slice of the fee pool. Their final payout will hinge on the structure of the deal and the final price among other factors. Freeman & Co estimates banks could make $60 million to $70 million in advisory fees, excluding financing, hedging and other revenue streams. The calculation does not include lawyers’ fees. The M&A; advisory fees will be the most significant but there could be additional money made on forex and interest hedging given the cross-border nature of the transaction.

Asian insurer AIA Group Ltd and Korea’s KB Financial Group also submitted first round bids, sources said. Korea Life Insurance Co, Canada’s Sun Life Financial Inc, and Switzerland’s Zurich Insurance Group, were also expected to submit offers. U.S. private equity fund J.C. Flowers & Co, TPG and Carlyle Group are among the buyout shops that have expressed interest, though they are expected to team up with a bidder to buy the Japanese business rather than bid on their own, sources said. The sources declined to be identified because details of the auction process remain confidential. ING declined to comment. Companies mentioned in this report either could not be reached for comment, or declined to comment. As part of the Asian divestment, ING received about 10 initial bids for its Asian asset management business this week. The asset management business, expected to fetch between $500 million and $600 million, is being sold separately. . ING had sent out more than a dozen information memorandums for its insurance business, which spans southeast Asia and includes operations in Japan and South Korea. A winning bid by a larger insurer could introduce more competition into Asia’s rapidly growing life insurance market, currently dominated by AIA Group Ltd and British insurer Prudential plc . ING’s Asian operations offer a platform for insurers keen to expand their Asian footprint and tap into the region’s rapid premium growth. Life insurance premiums in emerging Asia are forecast to grow at 9.5 percent this year and 8.7 percent next year, nearly three times the world average, according to Swiss Re estimates. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity which many CEOs will find hard to let go,” said one banker who is advising a potential buyer. ING CEO Jan Hommen said last week that the Asian divestments would probably fetch less than 8 billion euros ($10.2 billion). A deal would need to surpass $7.06 billion to become Asia’s biggest insurance deal and overtake Australian fund manager AMP’s 2011 purchase of AXA’s Australian unit, Thomson Reuters data shows. For a factbox on major deals, click on Most buyers are likely to place aggressive bids in the first round in order to advance to the second round. But the deal has its own challenges and not all bidders are keen to lay their hands on the entire Asian pie. Potential buyers are most wary of ING’s Japan insurance business due to uncertainty over liabilities arising from variable annuity products on its books there.. ING’s Southeast Asian operations are the most sought after, sources said. ING has indicated that it prefers bids for the whole Asian business, though it is allowing offers for three geographic regions: Southeast Asia, South Korea and Japan. ING has prohibited bidders from forming consortiums in the first round though those who move into the second round could join hands and break up the asset. ING’s decision to invite bids for geographic portions as well as its entire Asia operations is designed to enhance bid competition and maximise sale value, sources said. ING plans to hold management presentations for the shortlisted bidder by mid-June sources added. The sources were not authorised to speak to the media. All companies mentioned in this report either declined to comment or could not be reached for comment. ING operates across seven Asian centres. Profits from its Asia-Pacific insurance operations rose 39 percent in the first quarter of 2012 from a year ago to 218 million euros ($282.2 million), according to the latest company filings. South Korea and Japan accounted for 77 percent of the profits while Malaysia accounted for 10 percent. Japan accounted for about 45 percent of Asia-Pacific’s underlying profit before tax, followed by South Korea and Malaysia. For investment banks starved of IPOs and M&A; deals, ING’s Asian divestment could provide a much needed boost. Bankers and lawyers stand to earn about $100 million in fees if the deal is completed, some sources said. By winning the sell-side mandate, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are best-placed to earn a slice of the fee pool. Their final payout will hinge on the structure of the deal and the final price among other factors. Freeman & Co estimates banks could make $60 million to $70 million in advisory fees, excluding financing, hedging and other revenue streams. The calculation does not include lawyers’ fees. The M&A; advisory fees will be the most significant but there could be additional money made on forex and interest hedging given the cross-border nature of the transaction.

97,MET,"UPDATE 6-MetLife targets global growth, gets bank subpoenas","* Aims for 12-14 percent return on equity by 2016 * To shift focus in U.S. products * Gets subpoenas on mortgages, foreclosures * Shares fall 2.7 percent By Ben Berkowitz May 23 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc will change `its product mix in the United States and push harder for growth in international markets to substantially boost returns by 2016, the largest U.S. life insurer said on Wednesday. MetLife also said it had received two subpoenas in April and May from regulators looking into mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices at its banking unit. The company had shut its mortgage businesses by then, and is in the process of selling the deposit-taking portion of the bank to General Electric Co. MetLife shares were down 2.7 percent in late-morning trading and were among the biggest decliners in the S&P; insurance index . The fall was a continuation of the stock’s slide over the last two months. The change in long-term targets is part of a strategic review in recent months by Chief Executive Steve Kandarian, who was promoted from chief investment officer a year ago. MetLife said it would aim for a return on equity of as much as 14 percent by 2016, compared with 10.3 percent in 2011. Emerging markets should represent 20 percent of operating earnings in five years, up from 14 percent now, it said. “The environment is not a wonderful environment; we all know that,” Kandarian said at the outset of an investor day presentation. “The key here is balancing growth, profitability and risk.” Barclays Capital analyst Jay Gelb, in a note to clients, said the ROE target could be conservative because the company is assuming a “modest” level of share buybacks over the next five years. The insurer plans to cut pretax expenses by $600 million through a variety of measures, Kandarian said, including consolidating vendors globally. Growth, on the other hand, would come from both existing businesses and acquisitions. MetLife is one of several companies that have submitted first-round bids for the Asia life insurance business of ING , sources have told Reuters. MetLife boosted its presence in international markets in late 2010 when it bought global insurer Alico from AIG. Sources have said a deal for the ING business could come in somewhere between $7.5 billion and $9 billion. Kandarian seemed to shy away from the prospect of a deal on that scale. “If we’re able to pick up a property in Southeast Asia at a price that makes sense to us ... we’ll do that, but we’re not going to simply chase blue sky deals,” he said. MetLife’s comfort zone for dealmaking right now is more in the $2 billion to $3 billion range, he said. MetLife said it would shift its U.S. business mix toward products like accident and health insurance, and away from more capital-intensive businesses like annuities, to help make its cash flow more predictable. “I think the variable annuity business is causing something of an overhang for MetLife’s stock,” Bill Wheeler, the president of MetLife’s Americas unit, said during the presentation. He said MetLife’s risk in that business was relatively limited, but the company would still keep sales down substantially from last year. Wheeler also said operating earnings in the Americas should be “nicely higher” this year compared with the $3.9 billion posted for 2011. Last month, the company reported a $174 million loss for the first quarter on derivatives losses tied to a rise in interest rates, but operating results were higher than expected. The strongest growth came in Asia and Latin America. In a separate filing on the subpoenas, the company said various state or federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities might seek monetary penalties from MetLife Bank, but it could not estimate the financial impact. The sale of the bank to GE Capital is pending. At one time MetLife had hoped it would close by the end of June, but Kandarian cautioned last month that there could be no firm timetable because of all the regulators that had to weigh in. A GE spokesman said the subpoenas should not have any impact on the deposit sale. Getting rid of the bank, and the bank holding company charter that comes with it, is key to MetLife’s plans to raise its dividend and buy back shares. The Federal Reserve has blocked it from doing so twice in the last year. Kandarian said Wednesday that MetLife had no more information now than a month ago on how soon the various regulators would consider the bank sale. He added the company would refrain from saying anything definite on share buybacks until the sale closes. MetLife shares were down 84 cents at $30.23 on the New York Stock Exchange. Barclays’ Gelb described the valuation as “attractive,” as the stock currently trades at roughly two-thirds of book value. It has been a volatile few months for MetLife investors. In the three months starting in mid-December, the shares rose about 36 percent. Since a mid-March peak, though, the stock had fallen some 21 percent as of Tuesday’s close.",5232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/metlife/update-6-metlife-targets-global-growth-gets-bank-subpoenas-idUSL4E8GN4WW20120523

106,MET,MetLife exits $7billion ING Asia insurance sale: source,"HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N) is no longer bidding for the $7 billion sale of ING’s ING.AS Asia life insurance unit, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, raising the chances that the Dutch bank may have to sell it off in chunks. MetLife, with a market value of about $31 billion, was seen as a strong contender to buy the entire ING Asia life division but its offer was deemed too low, several sources familiar with the situation said. Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU.N), worth $21.8 billion, also viewed as a possible buyer, bowed out of the process earlier last month, the sources said. Several major insurance companies remain in the auction, as previously reported by Reuters. But with markets falling across the globe, and two large buyers out of the auction, the prospect of ING and its advisers needing to consider a more piecemeal approach to the sale is a real possibility, the sources said. ING could allow bidders to opt out of any of the three regions in the business, and sell the remainder to a party that have expressed interest in only one market. One possibility under consideration is ING breaking up the auction into three distinct regions of Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia, they said, rather than one collective group. That would complicate the sale but would allow smaller, more nimble bidders to court parts of the business rather than the whole. “In order to maximize the price you want to keep that flexibility,” said one of the people. “When you have a consortium bidding for everything but (with) a low price on Korea, you may be better off telling these guys why don’t you take out Korea and improve your bid. And then (you would) sell it separately,” the source said. ING will use the proceeds to repay part of the state aid it received during the 2008 crisis. In a separate process, it is also selling its asset management business. ING declined comment. Metlife and Prudential Financial were not immediately available for comment. MetLife CEO Steve Kandarian last month said the U.S. insurer’s comfort zone for dealmaking was in the order of $2-3 billion range.

110,MET,"Fed, FDIC limbo weighing on MetLife: analyst","(Reuters) - Regulatory delays on two fronts are creating an overhang on MetLife (MET.N) shares and stirring fears the largest U.S. life insurer may not be able to return more capital to shareholders, analysts at Sterne Agee said on Thursday. The stock fell 0.9 percent at mid-afternoon, on a day when markets were higher and almost the entire insurance sector was up as well. MetLife shares are down nearly 7 percent in 2012 and are off 26 percent from a high point reached three months ago, in both cases badly underperforming the Standard & Poor’s insurance index .GSPINSC. Analyst John Nadel, in a note to clients, said it appeared investors were preoccupied with the possibility that MetLife may have to resubmit a plan for share buybacks and dividends to the Federal Reserve. The Fed has oversight of MetLife because the insurer is also a bank holding company, due to its online deposit-taking operations. The central bank rejected the company’s plan to raise its dividend and buy back shares in October 2011, pending stress testing, and rejected it again last March after certain ratios were below the test’s thresholds. But MetLife is also in the process of selling the bank’s deposit-taking operations to General Electric’s (GE.N) GE Capital unit. In light of that, Nadel said, the company has asked the Fed for permission to not resubmit its plans. A MetLife spokesman said the company remains in discussions with the Fed about how to proceed, given the pending sale. At the same time, MetLife is also stuck waiting on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp to put the sale on its agenda, another key step in the process. Nadel said the deal did not make the FDIC’s June agenda and it remains unclear whether it will be considered in July either. “(It) appears MET sits in limbo both awaiting the Fed’s formal approval or denial of the request not to resubmit as well as with the FDIC in terms of beginning the formal regulatory approval process for the sale of the bank,” Nadel said. In a worst-case scenario - assuming the Fed made MetLife resubmit, the company failed stress testing again and the central bank made the company plug any shortfall - MetLife could cover its obligations with two years of retained earnings, Nadel said. If MetLife did not buy back stock, that would cut expected earnings per share by nearly 5 percent in 2013, he added.

111,MET,MetLife gets Fed extension on capital plans,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc received a three-month extension from the U.S. Federal Reserve on its plans to return capital to shareholders, the company said on Tuesday, potentially removing a short-term overhang on its stock. Its shares were up 5.4 percent on Tuesday afternoon, leading the sector. MetLife, which has been blocked from raising its dividend or buying back shares twice in the last eight months, said in a regulatory filing the Fed gave it an extension to September 30 from June 12. After failing a Fed stress test in March, MetLife had been on the hook to submit a new version of its capital plan by this month. Those March tests, which covered 19 banks, considered whether companies would have enough capital if unemployment spiked again and housing prices took another plunge. Analysts have said MetLife was likely to fail another stress test even with a new capital plan, given that the tests were designed for banks and not insurers. That raised fears the Fed could force it to boost its capital ratios by raising money or retaining earnings. A Sterne Agee analyst said last week the company was “in limbo” waiting on a Fed decision. MetLife is unique among big insurers in being regulated by the Fed because of its bank holding company charter.

112,MET,UPDATE 3-MetLife gets Fed extension on capital plans,"* Fed gives company until Sept. 30 to submit plans * Analysts said company was “in limbo” waiting on Fed * Shares up 5.4 pct in afternoon trading By Ben Berkowitz and Rick Rothacker June 19 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc received a three-month extension from the U.S. Federal Reserve on its plans to return capital to shareholders, the company said on Tuesday, potentially removing a short-term overhang on its stock. Its shares were up 5.4 percent on Tuesday afternoon, leading the sector. MetLife, which has been blocked from raising its dividend or buying back shares twice in the last eight months, said in a regulatory filing the Fed gave it an extension to Sept. 30 from June 12. After failing a Fed stress test in March, MetLife had been on the hook to submit a new version of its capital plan by this month. Those March tests, which covered 19 banks, considered whether companies would have enough capital if unemployment spiked again and housing prices took another plunge. Analysts have said MetLife was likely to fail another stress test even with a new capital plan, given that the tests were designed for banks and not insurers. That raised fears the Fed could force it to boost its capital ratios by raising money or retaining earnings. A Sterne Agee analyst said last week the company was “in limbo” waiting on a Fed decision. MetLife is unique among big insurers in being regulated by the Fed because of its bank holding company charter. The company is trying to shed the charter, having struck a deal to sell its online deposit-taking operations to General Electric Co. Some believe with the charter out of the way, MetLife could avoid further Fed stress testing, freeing it to return billions of dollars to investors. Of the four banks that failed the stress tests in March, only MetLife has needed extra time to resubmit its capital plan.

Hele, who joins MetLife from Arch Capital Group Ltd , replaces interim CFO Eric Steigerwalt. Before Arch, Hele was the chief financial officer of ING Groep NV, the bank bailed out by the Dutch government during the financial crisis. Last November, MetLife reorganized its business into three geographic regions, and it named then-CFO William Wheeler as president of its Americas division. Steigerwalt has been the interim CFO since. Hele will officially take up the new job from early September, MetLife said in a statement. He joins as the company faces a number of regulatory challenges, among them its ongoing efforts to buy back shares and raise its dividend, moves thus far blocked by the Federal Reserve.

Foggin will help manage international bond strategies for Fidelity’s Pyramis Global Advisors unit and also assist on U.S. mutual funds, while Ross will be an institutional portfolio manager at Pyramis. Foggin had been lead portfolio manager for fixed income at Schroder Investment Management. Ross had previously worked with the global fixed-income division of Deutsche Bank AG’s  Deutsche Asset Management. The bank named Don Robertson as managing director, head of natural resources for Canada. He most recently worked at Credit Suisse in Toronto.

119,MET,MetLife expects to meet targets even with low rates,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) still expects to hit its long-term targets for return on equity, even if 10-year U.S. Treasury yields remain at their historically low levels, the chief executive officer of the largest U.S. life insurer said on Thursday. The company also said it still had no sense of when federal regulators might consider its pending deal to sell its online deposit-taking operations to GE Capital, a transaction crucial to its plans to return capital to shareholders. MetLife shares rose nearly 5 percent in early trading. On a conference call with analysts, CEO Steve Kandarian said that while interest rates are much lower now than they were when the company gave rate sensitivity projections last fall, there was no additional impact to earnings-per-share expectations for this year or next. Last fall, the company gave a presentation where it modeled the effects of 10-year yields around 2 percent for five years. Although they are some 60 basis points lower now, Kandarian said MetLife could handle it this year and next. If rates remain at that level, the 2014 impact would be about 5 cents per share, he added. Even so, he said the company could achieve the low end of its 2016 return on equity targets. That low-rate scenario could force MetLife to strengthen its reserves modestly to meet regulatory requirements, interim Chief Financial Officer Eric Steigerwalt said, and goodwill in the company’s retirement products business could be under pressure. On Wednesday, MetLife said it had a $1.4 billion gain in the second quarter because of the decline in interest rates and derivatives it holds to hedge its rate risk. <ID: nL2E8J1IBV> Interest rates are the primary concern of life insurers right now, given their long-term obligations. As older investments mature, they have to reinvest those proceeds at historically low rates. The risk is that if rates remain low, returns may not be sufficient to cover future obligations. Conversely, if rates rise quickly, that would be problematic, given the writedowns that would be likely on low-rate investments on the books. Kandarian also addressed MetLife’s pending sale of its bank deposit-taking operations to General Electric Co (GE.N) unit GE Capital, saying the application was pending before regulators and that the company still did not know when they would act on the deal. MetLife is currently a bank holding company, which means it falls under U.S. Federal Reserve oversight. The Fed has twice in the last year blocked the company from raising dividends or buying back shares amid concerns over its capital ratios. MetLife has said it hopes to shed the bank holding company charter so it can get out of Fed oversight and return capital to shareholders this year. At the same time, the company has acknowledged it may be tagged as systemically important, which would keep it under the Fed’s purview regardless. MetLife shares rose 4.8 percent to $31.89 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. Through Wednesday’s close, the stock was down 2.4 percent for the year, underperforming a 6.7 percent gain for the S&P; insurance index .GSPINSC. At a price-to-expected-earnings ratio of about 5.9, the company lags the sector average of around 7.3.

123,MET,NY state regulator seeks details on captive insurers: WSJ,"(Reuters) - New York state’s top financial regulator is investigating whether life insurance companies are concealing details about their financial health by shifting liabilities to affiliated firms, the Wall Street Journal reported.

130,MET,"GE, MetLife tweak terms of deal for $7 billion in bank deposits","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc and General Electric Co have tweaked the terms of a deal in which the U.S. life insurer is selling $7 billion in bank deposits to the conglomerate, a move MetLife said would change the regulator in charge of approving the deal. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will now be responsible for approving the deal, first announced in December, rather than the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, MetLife said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late on Friday. Under the new structure, GE Capital Retail Bank, rather than GE Capital Bank, will buy MetLife’s banking deposits - a move GE’s finance arm is making to become less dependent on sales of commercial paper and bonds. The retail bank is regulated by the Comptroller of the Currency, while GE Capital Bank answers to the FDIC, said GE spokesman Russell Wilkerson. One brokerage said the delays appeared to be related to the GE side of the deal, and that the change may expedite the process. “Our understanding has been that the FDIC has been requiring additional information from GE Capital Bank, not from (MetLife), and that this has been holding up the approval process,” Sandler O’Neill said in a note on Monday. “The OCC was also involved in the prior review, so we believe that an approval of the sale to a different subsidiary of GE Capital may take less time.” GE’s Wilkerson declined to comment on whether the FDIC had been slow to approve the deal. An FDIC spokesman had no immediate comment on whether the change would accelerate the process. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, GE Capital’s strategy was to trade on its parent company’s then-“AAA” credit rating to borrow money at low interest rates and then lend it out at higher rates. However, the giant industrial company lost that top-notch credit rating during the crisis - Standard & Poor’s now rates it “AA+” while Moody’s Investor Service has an “Aa3” rating on the company - making that a less appealing strategy. GE has also sought to limit its dependence on borrowing. Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said in May the company aims eventually to cut the amount of short-term commercial paper it issues to $25 billion, down from $43 billion at the end of the second quarter and $105 billion in early 2008 before the financial crisis. Acquiring MetLife’s deposits would give GE a “low-cost funding source,” said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co. MetLife is eager to get rid of its banking operations so it can move forward with a plan to raise its dividend and buy back shares, a move the Federal Reserve has thwarted repeatedly. The Fed blocked MetLife last autumn on the grounds that the company should face stress testing, and then again earlier this year after the company failed those stress tests. Senior MetLife executives argued in response that the Fed should not be using bank metrics to evaluate insurers, but to no avail. The largest life insurer in the United States has already shut down its mortgage operations, and after selling the deposits business, would be able to surrender its bank holding company charter. With the bank charter out of the way, analysts expect MetLife to raise its dividend about 49 percent and to buy back around $2 billion in stock. MetLife’s shares rose 1.5 percent to $35.40 in afternoon trading, outpacing the rest of the sector. The stock is up 13.6 percent in 2012, underperforming gains of nearly 16 percent for the S&P; insurance industry index. GE was down 16 cents at $22.37 on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with its peers. Its shares have risen almost 26 percent since the start of the year, more than double the 11 percent rise of the Dow Jones industrial average.

Senior MetLife executives argued in response that the Fed should not be using bank metrics to evaluate insurers, but to no avail. The largest life insurer in the United States has already shut down its mortgage operations, and after selling the deposits business, would be able to surrender its bank holding company charter. With the bank charter out of the way, analysts expect MetLife to raise its dividend about 49 percent and to buy back around $2 billion in stock. MetLife’s shares rose 1.5 percent to $35.40 in afternoon trading, outpacing the rest of the sector. The stock is up 13.6 percent in 2012, underperforming gains of nearly 16 percent for the S&P; insurance industry index. GE was down 16 cents at $22.37 on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with its peers. Its shares have risen almost 26 percent since the start of the year, more than double the 11 percent rise of the Dow Jones industrial average.",9242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/ge-metlife/ge-metlife-tweak-terms-of-deal-for-7-bln-in-bank-deposits-idUSL1E8KOAIV20120924

138,MET,MetLife gets Fed extension with bank deal pending,"(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has again extended the deadline for MetLife Inc (MET.N) to resubmit capital plans while the insurer works to complete a sale of its bank deposit-taking operations to a unit of General Electric (GE.N). In a filing with securities regulators on Monday, MetLife said it received notice from the Fed last week, granting an extension until January 5, 2013. The deadline had been September 30, which itself was an extension of a June deadline. MetLife has a bank holding company charter because of the bank and is therefore overseen by the Fed. Last March, the company failed a stress test and was blocked by the U.S. central bank from raising its dividend or buying back shares. Without the extension, MetLife would have been forced to submit another plan for buybacks or dividends, one that would likely have been rejected yet again because it still owns the bank. MetLife has said that it hopes to be able to return capital once it is rid of the banking operations. Last year GE Capital agreed to buy the deposit-taking operations of the online bank, but the deal has been held up by regulatory reviews. GE and MetLife tweaked the deal in September so that instead of the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is now in charge of approving the sale.

159,MET,Regulator approves GE deal for MetLife deposit business,"(Reuters) - The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has approved MetLife’s sale of its deposit-taking business to a unit of General Electric Co’s (GE.N) GE Capital, MetLife Inc (MET.N) said on Wednesday. The long-delayed approval brings MetLife, the largest life insurer in the United States, one step closer to shedding its banking business and its bank holding charter. GE Capital and MetLife first struck a deal in late 2011, but regulatory reviews have held it up since. In September they restructured the sale so that the OCC would be the regulator to approve the deal, and not the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Analysts said at the time that the FDIC was slowing the deal down with inquires to GE and that switching to the OCC might mean a faster approval. After the sale closes, MetLife said it will move to deregister as a bank holding company. Because it holds that charter, it has been subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve.

160,MET,UPDATE 1-Regulator approves GE deal for MetLife deposit business,"* Deal signed in late 2011 * Amended in September for faster approval * MetLife aims to return cash to investors Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has approved MetLife’s sale of its deposit-taking business to a unit of General Electric Co’s GE Capital, MetLife Inc said on Wednesday. The long-delayed approval brings MetLife, the largest life insurer in the United States, one step closer to shedding its banking business and its bank holding charter. GE Capital and MetLife first struck a deal in late 2011, but regulatory reviews have held it up since. In September they restructured the sale so that the OCC would be the regulator to approve the deal, and not the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Analysts said at the time that the FDIC was slowing the deal down with inquires to GE and that switching to the OCC might mean a faster approval. After the sale closes, MetLife said it will move to deregister as a bank holding company. Because it holds that charter, it has been subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve.

The purchase price for Constitution Center at 400 7th Street SW was about $730 million, a person familiar with the transaction said. The price would be a record for an office building in the district, according to real estate information provider Real Capital Analytics. Insurers, hungry for yield, have been buying up well-leased buildings that offer higher returns than bonds and relatively similar safety. “We are pleased to acquire an asset of this quality, which will provide attractive returns over a long-term investment horizon,” Robert Merck, MetLife’s global head of real estate investments, said in a statement. While consolidation and proposed cutbacks of federal government spending has weakened the demand for office space in Washington, D.C., the fully leased building does not face near-term lease expirations, said Dan Fasulo, Real Capital Analytics managing director. A $250 million renovation was completed earlier this year at the 10-story, 1.4 million square-foot building.

165,MET,"MetLife warns on 2013 profit, expects no stock buybacks","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) warned that 2013 earnings might be well below Wall Street expectations and said it did not expect to buy back any shares next year, a blow to investors who have been waiting more than a year for a capital return. The largest life insurer in the United States also said it needed to move faster on strategic changes amid a persistently low-interest-rate environment. While MetLife has said in the past that it was well equipped to handle years of low rates, particularly with a hedging program it has put in place, the company acknowledged on Thursday that it was in a “lower-for-longer” scenario. Because their obligations are usually long-term, life insurers invest the premiums they collect in hopes of generating sufficient return to pay those obligations over time. In a low-rate environment, it becomes much harder for insurers to generate enough return to meet those commitments. MetLife said operating earnings per share next year would be lower than this year, compared with Wall Street expectations for growth in the low single digits. However, it also said the forecast was “broadly consistent” with its long-term outlook of a year ago. For this year, the insurer expects operating earnings of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, or $5.15 to $5.25 per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $5.25. In 2013, it expects $5.5 billion to $5.9 billion, or $4.95 to $5.35 per share. Analysts’ average forecast is $5.47, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MetLife’s operating earnings forecast excludes discontinued operations and net investment gains and losses. Shares of MetLife rose 2 percent to $34.29 in morning trading. At Wednesday’s close, the stock had risen about 5 percent this year. On a year-end investor call with analysts, MetLife management said the 2013 forecast assumes no share buybacks. Chief Executive Steve Kandarian later added, “I don’t have total confidence” the company will be free to buy back shares after 2013, either. MetLife investors have waited since the autumn of 2011 for the company to buy back shares and raise its dividend, but regulators foiled the company’s plans. Because of its online bank, MetLife has a bank holding company charter and is subject to Federal Reserve oversight. The Fed blocked MetLife from a buyback in late 2011, and the company failed a Fed bank stress test earlier this year. On Wednesday, the insurer won approval from banking regulators for a long-delayed deal to sell the deposits portion of its bank to General Electric Co’s (GE.N) GE Capital unit. Once that sale closes, MetLife will seek to relinquish the bank charter, which may mean the end of Fed oversight. RBC Capital Markets analyst Eric Berg, in a research note, said the sale “was certainly a step in the right direction.” But MetLife executives said they could not be sure when the sale would close, and how that timing would affect whether the company has to participate in another stress test, meaning it was “prudent” to assume it would not buy back shares next year. Even with the bank sold, MetLife is also considered at risk of being declared a systemically important financial institution by a federal panel, which would put it right back under Fed supervision and could restrict its payout ability. “And we fear that knowing this, Met will go slow on share repurchase - exactly the opposite of what investors want to hear from the company,” RBC’s Berg said.

176,MET,"MetLife, GE close long-delayed bank deposit deal","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) has closed the sale of its deposit-taking business to General Electric Co (GE.N), a move that allows the largest U.S. life insurer to start the process of dropping registration as a bank holding company. For GE, the deal will allow its GE Capital unit to rely less on borrowing by providing it with an alternative source of funding for its lending. The deal, in which GE will take on about $6.4 billion in bank deposits had been in the works for more than a year, with regulatory review the main reason for the delay. MetLife is not disclosing any other financial terms, said MetLife spokesman Chris Breslin. “This is really good news for MetLife,” said Vincent Lui, an equity analyst for Morningstar. “It’s one last hurdle they need to clear in order to exit itself from a bank holding company structure.” As a bank holding company, MetLife was subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. In March the insurer failed a stress test and was blocked by the Fed from raising dividends or buying back shares. New York-based MetLife said the deal reflected its desire to focus on insurance and employee benefits. It said it has started the process of deregistering as a bank holding company. The two companies in September tweaked the deal structure to make it subject to the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, rather than the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, and won approval in mid-December. Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE reached the deal to buy the deposit-taking unit in December 2011, with an eye toward making its GE Capital finance unit less dependent on borrowing. With the deposit sale closed, investors will scrutinize MetLife’s fourth-quarter earnings report, expected in mid-February, for insights on whether a U.S. government panel will tag the company as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. “If it’s considered a SIFI, there’s more regulation,” said Morningstar’s Lui. “We might find out more about that in the upcoming earnings.” MetLife will likely not resume share buybacks until it “receives clarity on the implications of a non-bank SIFI designation,” according to a Barclays equity research note to clients. Shares of MetLife were down 36 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $35.98 in early afternoon trading, while GE shares slipped 7 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $21.11.

MetLife said BBVA, Spain’s second-biggest bank, has agreed to transfer its 64.3 percent stake to MetLife. “The assets, customers and intellectual capital this transaction brings into the MetLife family of businesses will transform our operations in Chile,” said MetLife’s William Wheeler, president, the Americas. “With the acquisition of Provida, MetLife’s operating earnings from emerging markets are expected to grow from 14 percent today to approximately 17 percent,” the company said in a statement The transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013 and, is expected to add about 5 cents per share in 2013 and 15 cents per share in 2014 to operating earnings. As of September 30, Provida had $45.3 billion in assets under management and 1.8 million contributors, Metlife said. BofA Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisor to MetLife.

192,MET,"MetLife to drop bank-holding tag, Fed scrutiny lingers","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, said it could remain subject to strict regulatory oversight even after deregistering as a bank holding company, sending its shares down as much as 4 percent. MetLife received regulatory approval on Thursday to deregister as a bank holding company, which will reduce scrutiny from the Federal Reserve and free up capital to pay dividends or buy back shares. As a result of this approval, the insurer would not be required to resubmit its capital plan and would not be subject to the Fed’s next stress test, MetLife spokesman Chris Breslin said in an emailed statement. The central bank blocked MetLife from buying back shares in late 2011, and the company failed a Fed stress test last March. But Chief Executive Steve Kandarian said on a conference call with analysts that MetLife would have to assess the regulatory environment before finalizing plans for a buyback. “Substantial uncertainty will still remain on the regulatory front as we face the possibility of a non-bank SIFI,” he said. If designated a non-bank SIFI - a systemically important financial institution - MetLife would be subject to continued Fed oversight as it would be deemed “too big to fail” because their collapse could have repercussions for the wider economy. Insurer American International Group Inc said in November that it expected a federal panel to tag it a non-bank SIFI. [ID:nL1E8MC0LY] MetLife started the process of dropping its registration as a bank holding company after closing the sale of its deposit-taking business to General Electric Co’s GE Capital unit last month. The company said on Thursday it had received approvals to deregister as a bank from both the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The GE deal, struck in late 2011, had been held up by regulatory reviews, but the companies restructured the sale in September so that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) would be the regulator responsible for approving the deal. The OCC approved the deal in December.

200,MET,Judge OKs settlement with New York City Stuyvesant Town tenants,"NEW YORK, April 10 (Reuters) - A New York judge has approved a $68.75 million settlement between the current and former owners of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village and tenants who said they were overcharged on rent of the sprawling Manhattan apartment complex, tenants’ lawyers said Wednesday. Under the deal, bondholders who hold the mortgage to the property, which is serviced by CWCapital Asset Management LLC, and past owner MetLife Inc will pay a total of $68.75 million to roughly 27,500 class members. The tenants also saved roughly $105 million in rent reductions, bringing the total recovery to $173.25 million, lawyers for the tenants said. The deal was preliminarily approved by Justice Richard Lowe in New York state court in November. The settlement effectively ends the years-long litigation and relieves a major hurdle blocking a potential sale of the complex. Plaintiffs’ lawyers said the deal was the largest tenant settlement in U.S. history. “This is a genuinely historic and well-deserved outcome,” said Alexander Schmidt, a lead plaintiffs’ attorney, in a statement. A lawyer and spokesman for CWCapital did not immediately return requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for MetLife. About 25,000 people live in Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, a complex of 56 high-rise brick buildings with roughly 11,200 units on Manhattan’s East Side. Tenants sued in 2007, saying that the owners of the complex had illegally deregulated apartments and raised rents for thousands of tenants, while benefiting from tax breaks available for rent-stabilized buildings. They had sought roughly $215 million in their lawsuit. Under the deal, bondholders will contribute $58.25 million of the $68.75 million cash component of the settlement, according to tenants’ lawyers. Past owner MetLife Inc. will contribute $10.5 million, tenants’ lawyers said. An estimated 27,500 class members will receive settlement checks ranging from $150 to more than $100,000 later this year, they added. The settlement also continues rent stabilization for 4,311 formerly de-controlled units in Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village through June 2020, tenants’ lawyers said. Depending on market rates, the additional stabilization measures save tenants as much as $300 million by 2020, according to tenants’ lawyers. Tenants’ lawyers will received $18.9 million from the settlement fund for their work, they added. MetLife sold the complex in 2007 for a record $5.4 billion to a group led by Tishman Speyer Properties LP and a real estate unit of Blackrock Inc. CWCapital, a special servicer representing bondholders, took control of the complex after Tishman missed a debt payment.",4102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/newyork-rent-settlement/judge-oks-settlement-with-new-york-city-stuyvesant-town-tenants-idUSL2N0CX26N20130410

202,MET,MetLife raises dividend for the first time since 2007,"April 23 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, raised its quarterly dividend for the first time since 2007, sending its shares up as much as 7 percent on Tuesday. MetLife received approval from the Federal Reserve in February to drop its status as a bank holding company, freeing the insurer from the central bank’s scrutiny and allowing it to raise its dividend or buy back shares. The Fed had blocked MetLife from raising its dividend or returning capital to shareholders after the company failed a Fed stress test in March 2012. MetLife raised its second-quarter dividend by 9 cents, or almost 50 percent, to 27.5 cents per share. The company had paid an annual dividend of 74 cents per share since 2007. It paid its first-ever quarterly dividend, of 18.5 cents per share, in the first quarter of this year. MetLife’s shares have been little changed since the February announcement because it is widely expected to be designated a non-bank SIFI, or systemically important financial institution. If designated a SIFI by a U.S. government panel, the company would be subject to continued Fed oversight as it would be deemed “too big to fail”. “I think the timing is a little interesting ... I think they feel they needed to return capital before their hands are tied,” Morningstar analyst Vincent Lui said. Steven Schwartz, an analyst at Raymond James, said he assumed the company expected to be named a SIFI. “The company is saying ‘we are comfortable enough with the rules, as we understand they might be as of today, that we can at least deploy this amount regularly,’” he said. MetLife shares closed 5 percent higher at $37.74 on the New York Stock Exchange.

208,MET,Morgan Stanley must face part of MetLife MBS fraud case,"* MetLife alleges bad underwriting, document shredding * Some claims dismissed as untimely By Jonathan Stempel July 16 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley was ordered by a New York state judge to face part of a lawsuit in which life insurer MetLife Inc accused it of fraudulently selling $758 million of residential mortgage-backed securities that it knew were defective. While dismissing some claims as having been made too late, New York State Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten in Manhattan said MetLife may pursue claims that Morgan Stanley knew of underwriting defects and faulty appraisals, and pushed credit rating agencies to inflate ratings for the securities. Bransten’s decision is dated July 8, but was made public on Tuesday. In its lawsuit filed in April 2012, MetLife contended that Morgan Stanley knew that home loans underlying the securities were defective because an independent third party it had hired to conduct due diligence had found problems. MetLife also accused Morgan Stanley of shredding documents that showed the inability of borrowers to afford their loans, so it could negotiate cheaper prices before packaging the loans into the securities, which MetLife bought in 2006 and 2007. “Morgan Stanley was only too willing to go along with further machinations by its loan originators, which further heightened the risks for unsuspecting loan investors such as MetLife,” the amended complaint said. In her decision, Bransten said it was premature at this stage of the case to accept that Morgan Stanley disclosures were sufficient, that the bank lacked fraudulent intent, and that credit and housing market problems caused losses for MetLife. “Morgan Stanley advances no independent arguments in favor of dismissing either the fraudulent inducement or the aiding and abetting causes of action,” she wrote. Claims that were dismissed covered securities purchased by a Connecticut unit of MetLife. Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment. MetLife spokesman John Calagna was not immediately available for comment. Both companies are based in New York. The case is Metropolitan Life Insurance Co et al v.

209,MET,MetLife CEO says company is not 'systemically important',"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N), the largest U.S. life insurer, is not a systemically important financial institution whose failure could pose a threat to the nation’s financial stability, Chief Executive Steven Kandarian said. Kandarian’s comments late on Tuesday came after the U.S. financial risk council moved closer to designating MetLife as systemically risky. He said in a statement MetLife was notified by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) that it had reached “Stage 3” in the process to determine whether the insurer would be named a non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI). MetLife would be subject to stricter regulatory oversight if was given that designation. “Not only does exposure to MetLife not threaten the financial system, but I cannot think of a single firm that would be threatened by its exposure to MetLife,” Kandarian said. Last week, the FSOC handed SIFI designations to American International Group (AIG.N) and GE Capital (GE.N). The price of insurance products would go up if a handful of large life insurers were designated as systemically risky, Kandarian said. That would also reduce insurers’ ability to take on risks and could stop them from offering certain products. He said MetLife looked forward to working with the FSOC on the best way to “fulfil its obligation” to mitigate risk. The council, which includes the heads of other financial regulatory agencies, is a relatively new federal body that is testing its powers under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law for the first time. Dodd-Frank gave the regulatory council the power to identify potentially risky non-bank firms and regulate them more like banks after a number of non-bank firms struggled during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The FSOC generally assesses non-bank financial companies in a three-stage process. In Stage 3, the council contacts each non-bank financial company for further review.

211,MET,MetLife profit plunges on derivative losses,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc’s (MET.N) second-quarter profit plunged 80 percent due to derivative losses but still managed to beat analysts’ estimates as operating earnings increased in the company’s retail insurance business. The largest life insurer in the United States, like its peers, is heavily exposed to persistently low interest rates. But it has long had a substantial derivatives program designed to smooth out that risk. The company’s derivative net losses during the quarter ended June 30 was $1.2 billion, compared with a profit of $1.3 billion a year earlier. Operating earnings rose by 18 percent to $1.3 billion in the insurer’s Americas unit, driven by retail and group, voluntary & worksite benefits. Retail operating earnings rose 42 percent to $581 million. The insurer is close to being designated as a non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI), which would subject it to greater regulatory oversight in spite of shedding its bank-holding status. Earlier this month, the U.S. financial risk council designated American International Group (AIG.N) and General Electric Co’s (GE.N) GE Capital as systemically risky, bringing them under stricter regulations. As a part of stricter regulations, top global insurers, which include MetLife, will also have to hold more capital from 2019, according to the rules by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). MetLife’s net profit fell to $471 million, or 43 cents per share, in the second quarter from $2.26 billion, or $2.12 per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, it earned $1.44 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.33 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MetLife dropped its bank holding status earlier this year after closing the sale of its deposit-taking business to General Electric Co’s (GE.N) GE Capital unit. However, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) feels that MetLife’s failure could still pose grave threats to the country’s financial stability. An SIFI is a designation that is given to financial companies, specially banks, who are deemed “too big to fail.” Chief Executive Steve Kandarian had said the price of insurance products would go up if a handful of large life insurers were designated as systemically risky. The company’s net investment income fell about a percent to $5.10 billion. Low interest rates have led MetLife to focus on alternative businesses to boost profit. The company bought BBVA’s (BBVA.MC) Chilean pension fund for about $2 billion earlier this year to expand its presence in emerging markets. New York-based MetLife’s shares, which have risen 26 percent since the company reported its last quarterly results, closed at $48.42 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

218,MET,Fitch Rates MetLife's Debt Issuance 'A-',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  MetLife, Inc.'s (MetLife) issuance of $1 billion in 4.875% senior unsecured  notes due 2043.  The Rating Outlook on MetLife is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch expects the $1 billion of net proceeds will be used for general corporate  purposes, including repayment of upcoming debt maturities in 2014. Fitch's view  of MetLife's financial leverage is not affected by this transaction. The  company's financial leverage ratio was 27% as of Sept. 30, 2013. MetLife's ratings reflect Fitch's view that the company's recent financial  performance and balance sheet fundamentals remain consistent with rating  expectations.  The ratings are based on the company's strong statutory  capitalization and liquidity profile, and excellent financial flexibility. The  ratings also consider the company's highly diversified operating profile with  very strong market positions in several major insurance product lines and  markets in the U.S. and select international markets. Fitch estimates the combined risk-based capital (RBC) of MetLife's domestic life  insurance companies was in excess of 400% at Sept. 30, 2013 following the  shareholder dividend payment of $1.3 billion to the holding company in the first  nine months of 2013. GAAP interest coverage is expected to be in the 8 times  range for full-year 2013. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC RBC ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP interest  coverage ratio in the 8x-10x range. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC RBC ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and GAAP interest  coverage ratio below 5x.

220,MET,"UPDATE 1-Metlife, AIA place final bids for Citi bank distribution deal-sources","* Deal includes $1.5-2 bln in exclusivity payment * Citigroup has 34 mln retail accounts in Asia * Bancassurance sales have much room to grow in Asia By Denny Thomas HONG KONG, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Five insurers including Metlife Inc and AIA Group Ltd have submitted final bids to have their products distributed by Citigroup  in Asia, a deal estimated to generate more than $10 billion in revenue over 15 years, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. British insurer Prudential Plc, Canada’s Manulife Financial Corp and Hong Kong tycoon Richard Li’s insurance company FWD Group are the other companies that have submitted final bids, they said. Global insurers are increasingly relying on bank distribution to ramp up insurance sales in Asia, where rises in personal incomes for many countries have enabled individuals and families to afford insurance. If successful, the Citigroup deal would be Asia’s second-biggest bancassurance deal behind Prudential Plc’s  agreement with Standard Chartered Plc, people familiar with the matter said. There will most likely be just one successful bidder, although there is an outside chance that Citigroup may pick two given that the deal covers 14 Asian markets, one person said. FWD has only bid for bancassurance in four markets, while rest of the suitors are seeking Citigroup’s partnership in most of the 14 markets, they said. All the bids have come in around the same value, and suitors have improved their offers from the preliminary round, underscoring the strong interest in the sale process, a person said, adding that a deal should come early next year. The estimated $10 billion in future sales would be split between the winning insurer and Citigroup, and the deal also includes an exclusivity payment of $1.5-2 billion by the insurer to Citigroup, the people added. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment, as did representatives for the five insurance companies. Sources declined to be identified as the discussions are private. A successful bid would give that firm access to Citigroup’s 600 branches and over 34 million retail accounts in the region where the Wall Street bank has about $218 billion under management, including the assets of its private bank. Last year, Citigroup’s Asian consumer bank business accounted for about half of the $15 billion generated by Citigroup Asian unit. Bancassurance, as these agreements are called, was virtually non-existent in Asia but it has taken off since early 2000 and now accounts for 40 percent of insurance sales in Indonesia and half of all sales in Hong Kong. Still, it lags the sales in developed markets such as Spain, where 60 percent of all insurance sales come from bancassurance. Bancassurance has been a central plank of the roughly $32 billion insurance industry M&A; struck in Asia-Pacific region in the past two years. That includes Sun Life Financial Inc’s  and Malaysian state investor Khazanah’s deal to buy Aviva Plc’s Malaysian insurance joint venture with lender CIMB Group for $597 million earlier this year.

Manulife Financial Corp and Zurich Insurance Group  were among the other suitors to submit first round bids for the life insurance unit, as global and regional insurers descend on Southeast Asia for acquisition opportunities. Asia-Pacific M&A; in the insurance sector reached a record$30.5 billion worth of deals last year, driven by activity in places such as Malaysia and Thailand. AMMB will retain a part share in AmLife and fifty-one percent of AmFamily Takaful Berhad. The deal is subject to regulatory approval from the central bank and Malaysia’s finance ministry.

226,MET,UPDATE 2-RCS Capital to buy broker-dealer Cetera for $1.15 billion,"By Avik Das and Jessica Toonkel Jan 16 (Reuters) - RCS Capital Corp on Thursday announced it would buy independent broker-dealer Cetera Financial Group from private equity firm Lightyear Capital LLC for about $1.15 billion in cash to expand its retail brokerage business. New York-based Lightyear Capital, which is run by former Paine Webber Group Inc Chief Executive Officer Donald Marron, created Cetera in 2010 when it acquired three ING  broker-dealers. Over the years, Lightyear has continued to build Cetera through acquisitions. Just last year, it acquired two brokerage firms from MetLife Inc. Today the firm  provides broker-dealer and advisory services to about 6,500 independent financial professionals as well as financial institutions. RCS, which has been an aggressive acquirer over the past few months, approached Lightyear several times last year about buying Cetera, Marron said. But it was not until right before Christmas that Lightyear took the offer seriously, he said. “They said Cetera’s management would remain as it is and they asked if they could make a preemptive bid,” Marron told Reuters in an interview. “Price is important to private equity, but also is the firm (so) its value is in Valerie Brown and her team.” Cetera Chief Executive Valerie Brown will continue to operate Cetera. This is the fourth brokerage acquisition by New York-based RCS Capital, which just went public in June, in the last four months. It bought Summit Financial Services for $49 million in November and Investor Capital Holdings for about $52.5 million in October. It also bought Hatteras Funds Group in the same month for an undisclosed amount. The company’s investment banking arm and Barclays  were its financial advisers, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch  advised Cetera. The transaction is expected to close in the later part of 2014. RCS Capital’s shares were trading at $19.10, up over 3 percent in late afternoon trading, the New York Stock Exchange.",1162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/rcscapital-cetera/update-2-rcs-capital-to-buy-broker-dealer-cetera-for-1-15-billion-idUSL3N0KQ4HD20140116

231,MET,Investors who get MetLife may find it pays -Barron's,"March 9 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc is by some measures one of the cheapest Standard & Poor’s 500 stocks, and its shares could rise because the largest publicly-traded U.S. life insurer has a attractive global franchise and astute management, and may hike its dividend significantly, Barron’s said in its March 10 edition. With a stock price of $53.15, MetLife trades at just 9.3 times projected 2014 profit of $5.70 per share and 8.7 times projected 2015 profit of $6.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Barron’s said the 2015 projection is the lowest in the life insurance industry, and that fewer than 10 companies in the S&P; 500 have lower ratios. Two with similar ratios are insurers Prudential Financial Inc and Lincoln Financial Corp . In addition, MetLife is trading at just 1.1 times book value per share excluding unrealized investment gains, also among the lowest in the S&P; 500, Barron’s said. Fans say the stock price could rise above $60, and that the company known for its blimp and for advertising featuring Snoopy and other “Peanuts” characters could benefit from both a rising stock market and higher interest rates. According to the newspaper, part of the reason for the low price is MetLife’s refusal to buy back stock, as it awaits U.S. regulatory decisions on capital requirements and whether it will be declared a “systemically important financial institution,” a label that several of the nation’s biggest banks already carry. But the newspaper said Chief Executive Steven Kandarian has made reducing risk a priority, cutting back in variable annuities and halting sales of products such as new long-term care insurance policies and one type of universal life insurance. Meanwhile, rising stocks boost potential profit from equity-sensitive annuities, and rising rates could help MetLife more affordably fund fixed-rate products and cut risk on offerings that guarantee investors minimum returns, the newspaper said. Even if growth slows in the United States, MetLife has a cushion because 30 percent of its profit comes from other countries, and the overseas business is growing faster than the U.S. business, the newspaper said. MetLife’s annual $1.10 per share dividend equates to a 2.1 percent dividend yield, and Barron’s said it could approach $1.50 per share in 2015, or nearly 3 percent based on the current stock price.",3092014,http://www.reuters.com/article/metlife-barrons/investors-who-get-metlife-may-find-it-pays-barrons-idUSL2N0M60CO20140309
232,MET,Wall Street watchdog alleges annuity scheme by two ex-MetLife brokers,"(Reuters) - Two former brokers for MetLife Securities Inc, a unit of MetLife Inc, allegedly engaged in a seven-year scheme to inflate commissions by having customers switch $21 million in annuities, Wall Street’s industry-funded watchdog has alleged in a civil complaint. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) filed the regulatory complaint against Christopher Birli and Patrick Chapin, who both worked for MetLife in Williamsville, New York, until 2012. The two focused on advising employees of the State University of New York who participated in its retirement plan, FINRA alleged in a March 27 complaint. Birli did not immediately return a phone call requesting comment. Chapin did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. Efforts to reach Chapin by telephone were not successful. MetLife, which is not alleged to have engaged in any wrongdoing, terminated Birli and Chapin in 2012, according to filings. Neither presently work in the securities industry, according to filings. MetLife declined to comment on the complaints against the former brokers but said it maintains a comprehensive compliance procedure. The two former MetLife brokers, between 2004 and 2007, allegedly recommended that 45 of their customers switch MetLife variable annuities held in their retirement accounts with new variable annuities held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) outside the university plan, said FINRA. Birli and Chapin structured the deals in a way to circumvent a MetLife policy that generally prohibited exchanging the two types of variable annuities in the transactions, FINRA alleged. The brokers advised clients to first cash in their retirement plan annuities and buy another security within the plan to hold for 90 days. Clients would then sell that security to buy a variable annuity through an IRA, according to FINRA. The scheme generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions, FINRA said. FINRA’s complaint is the first step in a disciplinary proceeding that could lead to civil penalties against the former brokers, including suspending or barring them from the securities business. The former brokers will have an opportunity to dispute the allegations before a FINRA hearing officer. A variable annuity is a type of insurance product that offers investors steady income payments, typically in exchange for a lump-sum investment. Payments can grow if financial markets do well because they are tied to an investment portfolio, usually consisting of mutual funds holding stocks and bonds. Brokers are well rewarded for selling variable annuities, in part because of their high commissions, as much as 8 percent. The alleged scheme subjected investors to unnecessary risks, FINRA said. For example, the new annuity contracts tied up the investors’ funds for as much as seven years, FINRA said. Some customers also had to pay fees to cash in their initial annuities, FINRA said. Birli and Chapin allegedly concealed the nature of their scheme from MetLife by submitting “false and misleading” paperwork to MetLife and using their personal email addresses to communicate to customers, FINRA said.

238,MET,AIG sues NY regulator over probe of insurance marketing,"NEW YORK, April 3 (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc on Thursday sued New York regulators to force them to back off a threatened costly enforcement proceeding over possible violations of state law by a former unit. AIG’s lawsuit against the New York State Department of Financial Services and its superintendent, Benjamin Lawsky, is unusual, with an investigation target trying to stop any action. The dispute centers on American Life Insurance Co, better known as ALICO, and another former AIG unit known as DelAm. MetLife Inc, another insurer, both bought units from AIG in 2010. Earlier this week New York regulators said MetLife would pay $60 million because those two subsidiaries solicited insurance business in New York without a license. The Department of Financial Services added that a probe into possible violations by AIG and other units before the 2010 MetLife purchase was ongoing. In its complaint, AIG said New York officials have threatened to begin administrative proceedings and other actions in which they would seek “substantial monetary penalties” from AIG over ALICO’s activities. AIG said Lawsky’s activity violated its rights to due process and other provisions of the U.S. Constitution, and was an “unprecedented attempt” to expand his regulatory authority. The Department of Financial Services said it would respond in court. “AIG may not want to cooperate with our probe, but they are not above the law - no matter how big or powerful they may be,” Matt Anderson, a spokesman for Lawsky, said on Thursday. AIG last year repaid the last of what grew into a $182.3 billion federal bailout related to the financial crisis.

243,MET,Metlife wins first approval for foreign insurer branch in Shanghai free trade zone,"SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - The China venture of U.S. life insurer Metlife Inc has become the first foreign-backed insurance firm to receive regulatory approval to set up a branch in Shanghai’s free trade zone. The approval was announced by Sino-US United Metlife Insurance Co Ltd, jointly operated by state-owned Shanghai Lianhe Investment Co and Metlife, on its official microblog on Monday. The move comes nearly eight months after the free trade zone was launched, receiving considerable attention from overseas firms and hailed as potentially one of China’s boldest reforms in decades. However, that hype has cooled amid a lack of specific policy details since the initial fanfare. Foreign banks, such as Citigroup Inc < and HSBC Holdings PLC, have set up branches in the free trade zone but many foreign companies have been reluctant to follow suit citing a lack of clarity over what they exactly will be allowed to do in the zone. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission has said insurance firms will be allowed to enjoy looser restrictions on offshore investment and yuan-dominated cross-border reinsurance businesses compared with operations on the mainland, although no details have been published so far. Foreign insurers are only allowed to operate in China, including the free trade zone, through joint ventures with local partners.

256,MET,MetLife profit misses estimates as claims rise,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit as the largest U.S. life insurer paid out more in claims, sending its shares down nearly 2 percent. Policyholder claims and dividends paid out in the latest quarter rose nearly 9 percent to $9.96 billion, more than offsetting an 8 percent rise in premium revenue. “MetLife’s second-quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diverse business mix, as strong investment margins and favorable market performance helped offset unfavorable underwriting results,” Chief Executive Steve Kandarian said in statement on Wednesday. Kandarian has tried to scale back on capital-intensive businesses such as annuities to focus more on traditional life insurance and pension products. On an operating basis, the insurer earned $1.39 per share, missing analysts’ average estimate by 2 cents. Net income available to the company’s shareholders almost tripled to $1.34 billion, or $1.17 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from $471 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.  The company’s profit in the latest quarter benefited from a $202 million derivative gain. MetLife reported a $1.2 billion loss tied to its derivatives program a year earlier.  MetLife, like other insurers, is heavily exposed to persistently low interest rates. But it has long had a substantial derivatives program designed to smooth out that risk. Bloomberg reported last week that U.S. regulators are set to label MetLife as a non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institution by the end of July. (bloom.bg/1rz1sJd) If so, the insurer would be subject to much stricter Federal Reserve oversight as a financial company deemed “too big to fail.”  Kandarian has repeatedly maintained that MetLife should not be designated as systemically important, arguing that insurance premiums would go up if large life insurers were dubbed systemically risky. American International Group (AIG.N), GE Capital (GE.N) and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) were designated as systemically important last year.

263,MET,UPDATE 2-MetLife considers fight against US government's systemic tag,"(Adds reaction) By Douwe Miedema WASHINGTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Insurer MetLife said it is exploring ways to fight the U.S. government’s proposal on Thursday to deem it “systemically important” and subject it to stronger regulatory oversight. MetLife is the third insurer to be tapped for such a designation, which comes with heavy capital requirements and strict supervision by the Federal Reserve, comparable to that of the largest banks. The systemically important label is used to identify companies whose failure could pose a potential threat to financial markets. Prudential Financial Inc and AIG have already been deemed “systemic” by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which is comprised of the country’s top financial regulators and was formed after the recent credit crisis. MetLife said it was not ruling out “any of the available remedies” under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to contest the designation. “MetLife has served as a source of financial strength and stability during times of economic distress, including the 2008 financial crisis,” its chief executive, Steven Kandarian, said. The systemically important designations are part of an effort to rein in the largest and most risky firms after the credit crisis showed how one the collapse of such firm could roil global markets. But the process of designating systemically important financial institutions, known as SIFIs, has sparked a fierce debate on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers, particularly Republicans, have complained about regulatory overreach and a lack of transparency in how FSOC reaches its decisions. They have also raised concerns that systemic insurers would be saddled with bank-centric capital rules. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act automatically identified banks with over $50 billion in assets on their books as “systemic,” but left it to FSOC to determine whether some non-banks also deserved the tag. MetLife has more ardently argued against the designation than the other insurers, saying that unlike banks, its business lines and risk-taking do not have the potential to destabilize the larger financial system. The company has 30 days to request a hearing before FSOC, to explain why it disagrees with the proposal. The council must schedule the hearing within 30 days and then has 60 days to make a final decision. Eventually, MetLife could challenge a final designation in court. Scott Garrett, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, criticized Thursday’s decision as “irresponsible and inappropriate.” “The FSOC makes politically motivated decisions to expand the Fed’s power with little-to-no real-world analysis,” Garrett said in an emailed statement. The Fed itself has acknowledged it cannot tailor capital requirements for insurers without a legal fix to the Dodd-Frank act, and would have to treat them the same as banks. The fix of the so-called Collins amendment has passed the Senate, but is stuck in the House. Shares of MetLife have gained about 2.8 percent this year, after surging 64 percent in 2013 as the company scales back capital-intensive businesses to focus more on traditional life insurance and pension products.

265,MET,UPDATE 2-U.S. Fed to study impact of capital rules on big insurers,"(Adds MetLife comment) By Emily Stephenson WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced plans to study the potential effects of forcing big insurance companies to meet tough funding restrictions required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. The Wall Street oversight law directed regulators to identify big non-bank financial firms that could pose risks to the U.S. financial system. Those companies are regulated by the Fed and must meet capital requirements comparable to those for big U.S. banks. Insurers American International Group and Prudential Financial have already received this designation, and regulators are considering also applying it to MetLife. Those companies and other big insurers argue that bank-style capital requirements, which are limits on debt funding, do not fit their businesses and should be adapted. The Fed on Tuesday said it would study the issue to “better understand how to design a capital framework for insurance holding companies it supervises” under the Dodd-Frank law. “This is a welcome step in the right direction,” MetLife spokesman Christopher Stern said. “Done properly, this study could go a long way toward helping the Federal Reserve understand the negative consequences of imposing bank-centric rules on life insurance companies and consumers.” Lawmakers from both side of the aisle have pressed the Fed to tailor its capital requirements for insurers. Regulators have yet not proposed rules for Fed-regulated nonbank firms. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo told a Senate panel earlier this month that the regulator could tailor capital rules for insurance products that are not offered by banks, but lawmakers must revise Dodd-Frank if they want substantially different requirements for insurers. The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives both want to change the wording of Dodd-Frank regarding capital rules for insurers, but the two chambers have approved different bills. So far, they have not agreed on a single plan. The Fed said on Tuesday that it contacted insurance firms about its study and asked them to provide data by Dec. 31.

266,MET,Fitch Rates MetLife's Debt Issuance 'A-',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  MetLife, Inc.'s (MetLife) $1 billion senior unsecured debentures as follows: --$500 million of 1.903% Series E senior component debentures tranche 1 due  2017; --$500 million of 4.721% Series E senior component debentures tranche 2 due  2044. MetLife will remarket $999,848,000 of the debentures ($499,924,000 of each  tranche), with holders of $76,000 of each tranche electing not to participate in  the remarketing.   Fitch affirmed all of MetLife's existing ratings on Aug. 11, 2014 with a Stable  Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS The offering represents the scheduled remarketing of the Series E senior debt  associated with the outstanding common equity units issued by MetLife in  November 2010 as part of the financing of the acquisition of American Life  Insurance Company and Delaware American Life Insurance Company (collectively,  ALICO). Proceeds of the remarketing will be used by the holders of the common  equity units to settle stock purchase contracts associated with the units.  Fitch expects the $1 billion of net proceeds realized by MetLife upon the  settlement of the stock purchase contracts to be used for general corporate  purposes. Fitch's view of MetLife's financial leverage is not affected by this  transaction. The company's financial leverage ratio was 26% as of June 30, 2014.  Financial leverage has declined from a recent high of approximately 30% in the  third quarter of 2010 (3Q'10), shortly before its acquisition of ALICO. MetLife's ratings reflect Fitch's view that the company's strong balance sheet  fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very strong market positions  in several major insurance product lines, markets in the U.S. and select  international markets, are consistent with rating expectations. Fitch believes  that the company's large-scale, very strong brand name, and large and diverse  distribution capabilities provide significant competitive advantages.  Fitch's primary rating concerns include MetLife's above-average, albeit  moderating exposure to the variable annuity business, above-average investment  risk, and macroeconomic challenges associated with the ongoing low interest rate  environment.  MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's strong  risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch notes that  the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations  is considered strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's  domestic life insurance subsidiaries (excluding ALICO) reported combined  statutory total adjusted capital of approximately $24 billion and risk-based  capital (RBC) of 430% at year-end 2013. The company's domestic life insurance  subsidiaries reported a combined statutory net operating gain of approximately  $2.6 billion in 2013.  MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest  insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory  solvency margin ratio significantly above 800% at year-end 2013, which is above  both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers.  MetLife's GAAP interest coverage has improved significantly over the past five  years due primarily to solid growth in operating earnings. Interest expense has  also been slowly declining since 2011. Fitch expects MetLife's GAAP fixed charge  coverage ratio to be between 7x and 8x for full-year 2014 on a normalized basis  on fairly stable earnings performance.  Despite the ongoing low interest rate environment, MetLife has experienced  significant improvement in operating earnings. Earnings have been bolstered in  part by growing asset-based fees driven by attractive capital market  performance, relatively stable interest margins, which have benefited from  active management of crediting rates and interest rate hedges, as well as  international acquisition activity, particularly its acquisition of ALICO in  4Q'10. Fitch expects GAAP return on equity (ROE) to remain in the area of 12% in  2014 as continued growth in fee income and solid earnings from International  operations are at least partially offset by pressure from low interest rates. MetLife's equity market exposure is primarily attributable to its investment in  alternative investments and the large, albeit declining, size of its variable  annuity business. Fitch notes that the company's variable annuity hedging  program is robust and did perform well during the financial crisis. However, the  hedging of variable annuity risk requires the company to make policyholder  behavior assumptions that may prove inaccurate. Deviations from pricing and  hedging assumptions could have a material negative impact on MetLife's capital  and earnings in a severe but unexpected scenario. On Sept. 4, 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Board (FSOC) announced that  it had voted to preliminarily designate MetLife a non-bank systematically  important financial institution (SIFI), which could result in more stringent  oversight by the Federal Reserve. Although the specifics of the enhanced  supervision to which non-bank SIFIs will be subject have not been finalized, it  is likely that it will include higher capital requirements. MetLife has 30 days  following the announcement to request a hearing to contest the decision before  it becomes final, and Fitch believes that the company will do so. Fitch expects  such a designation to be credit neutral. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC RBC ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP fixed charge  coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC RBC ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and GAAP fixed charge  coverage ratio below 5x. Fitch has assigned the following ratings: MetLife, Inc. --1.903% Series E senior component debentures due 2017 'A-'; --4.721% Series E senior component debentures due 2044 'A-'.

267,MET,Insurer MetLife contests official tag as super-risky firm,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Insurer MetLife said on Friday it would fight a plan by the U.S. risk council to designate it as a firm whose demise could risk global finance, a tag that brings far greater regulatory scrutiny. The company had asked the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to call a meeting at which it could give written and oral evidence of why it disagreed with the proposed determination, it said in a regulatory filing. FSOC now has to schedule a meeting in 30 days, and must make a final decision within another 60 days. Eventually, MetLlife could challenge a final designation - which would subject it to oversight by the Federal Reserve - in court.     The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act automatically identified banks with over $50 billion in assets on their books as “systemic,” but left it to FSOC to determine whether some non-banks also deserved the tag. The designations are part of an effort to rein in the largest and most risky firms after the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers during the credit crisis showed how trouble at just one firm could roil global markets. Prudential Financial Inc and AIG have already been deemed “systemic” by FSOC, which is comprised of the country’s top financial regulators and was formed after the financial crisis to better coordinate the agencies. MetLife has more ardently argued against the designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) than the other insurers, saying that unlike banks, its business does not have the potential to destabilize the system. Banks that are SIFIs are subject to tougher capital requirements than their smaller peers, and need to pass an annual test of their financial health that determines whether they can raise dividends. The Fed has acknowledged it cannot tailor capital requirements for insurers without a legal fix to the Dodd-Frank act, and would have to treat them the same as banks, something the industry says would have detrimental effects. The fix to a part of the Dodd-Frank act that is known as the Collins amendment has passed the Senate but is stuck in the House.

The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of the main U.S. watchdogs, last month proposed adding MetLife to a small group of non-banks subject to tougher supervision because of their critical role in the financial system. MetLife has said it would contest the designation, which brings stricter capital requirements, arguing its business does not have the potential to destabilize the system and that it was a “source of strength” during the 2007-09 crisis.

275,MET,"What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Wednesday, Oct. 29","(The Day Ahead is an email and PDF publication that includes the day’s major stories and events, analyses and other features. To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)   The Federal Reserve wraps up a two-day meeting that appears certain to end with an announcement that the U.S. central bank’s bond-buying stimulus is coming to a close. Less certain is what Fed officials might say about the outlook for the economy and inflation, given an uncertain global backdrop that has led investors to reappraise when the central bank will be able to finally raise interest rates.    Visa Inc, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, is expected to report a fourth-quarter profit, helped by higher spending by customers using its cards. The company is looking to capitalize on the growing mobile payment business, as it has been gaining traction among businesses and consumers alike. Visa, which partnered with Apple for its Apple Pay service, also launched online offerings like Visa Checkout and Visa Token. Visa lowered its full-year revenue forecast in July, citing slow growth in cross-border transactions.  Global investment bank Deutsche Bank AG reports third-quarter results. Investment banking roared back to life in the quarter, but costs for fines and settlements are likely to have hit Germany’s top lender hard.  Barrick Gold Corp, the world’s biggest gold producer, is expected to report lower third-quarter results on a weaker gold price and a fall in gold production after the sale of some of its higher-cost gold mines. The market’s focus is likely to be on the way forward for Barrick following a number of key executive changes, including the elimination of its chief executive position. There will also likely be questions about Barrick’s assertion that a higher royalty rate in Zambia could threaten the economic viability of its Lumwana copper mine.  Canadian miners Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd and Yamana Gold Inc are expected to report third-quarter earnings. The market will likely be looking for updated commentary on Agnico’s outlook for 2015, news on expansions at the Goldex and Kittila mines and any further scope for acquisitions following the purchase of Mexico-focused miner Cayden. Yamana’s results are expected to be relatively low key, after the company announced preliminary production results earlier in the month that were in line with expectations. World’s second-biggest uranium miner Cameco Corp reports third-quarter results, following a challenging period. Canada’s biggest diversified metals company, Teck Resources Ltd, is expected to report lower third-quarter earnings on weaker coal and base metals prices, with the market’s focus on the impact of China’s recent decision to reimpose import tariffs on metallurgical and thermal coal.   French oil company Total SA reports third-quarter results. The impact of the sharp drop in oil prices since June should start hurting, although a drop in the euro could temper that somewhat.  Whiting Petroleum Corp, on the verge of buying Kodiak Oil & Gas to become North Dakota’s largest oil producer, is expected to post a spike in third-quarter profit thanks to increased drilling.  U.S. health insurer WellPoint Inc is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit. The company, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, will also be expected to give a pulse check on Obamacare.   Life insurer MetLife Inc is expected to report a rise in third-quarter profit, helped by derivative gains linked to credit spreads. The company, heavily exposed to persistently low U.S. interest rates, has a large derivatives program designed to reduce that risk. Last month, the Financial Stability Oversight Council proposed to designate the insurer as “systemically important,” which could subject it to stricter oversight by the U.S. Federal Reserve. MetLife, which has vehemently opposed the proposal, has decided to contest the decision.  Allstate Corp’s estimated pre-tax catastrophe loss for the third quarter is expected to be about $517 million, down significantly from $936 million in the preceding quarter. The largest listed U.S. home and auto insurer has been raising insurance rates in its home insurance business to offset catastrophe losses and low interest rates on its investments. Chief Executive Thomas Wilson said Allstate’s focus this year would be to attract customers to boost its market share rather than go for “abnormally large” price increases.  Department chain operator Kohl’s Corp’s leadership team will host an investor conference to present their “multi-year growth” plans. Kohl’s had said it expects third-quarter comparable sales to decrease 1.4 percent, hurt by weak demand for women’s apparel. The company also said its 2014 earnings would be at the low end of its prior forecast of $4.05-$4.45 per share and that sales remained softer through October.   Hershey Co, which makes Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, is likely to report a third-quarter profit above analysts’ average expectations, according to StarMine. Investors will be looking for indications on how the price increase has impacted sales, particularly as rival Mondelez International had to cut 2014 sales targets in August after price hikes to cover commodity costs sparked a backlash by consumers and retailers in some European markets.  After a slide in its shares this year, Eaton Corp will try to win back investors when it reports third-quarter results. The manufacturer of power systems and products has faced concerns about its markets and disappointed some investors when it signaled earlier this year that it would not spin off its vehicle business, as some on Wall Street had hoped.  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co’s results have been pressured this year, first from a severe U.S. winter that hurt auto demand and then by lower sales of its high-margin tires to automakers. The company has also sold fewer tires in Latin America, which has been hurt by lower vehicle production in Brazil and economic turmoil in Venezuela. These trends have also pinched rivals Bridgestone Corp and Michelin. Goodyear is the first of the group to report third-quarter results and investors will be watching for commentary on global auto production going into next year.  SunPower Corp, the second-largest solar panel maker in the United States, is expected to report a lower third-quarter profit. Uneven revenue recognition from solar projects has been weighing on the company’s results. The company is now diversifying into installation of solar panels on rooftops, a market dominated by SolarCity. Investors will look to see if SunPower will continue to lease out panels to customers, or adopt other financing methods. Also of interest to investors will be the formation of a yield co.   Akamai Technologies Inc, whose networks help improve the quality and speed of content delivery, is likely to report third-quarter revenue above the average analyst estimate, according to StarMine. Akamai is benefiting from higher consumption of online video and streaming music and the company had forecast current-quarter profit and revenue largely above estimates. However, higher spending on sales, marketing and research and development may impact profit as the company is investing more on developing higher margin services to compete with rivals.  Network equipment makers JDS Uniphase Corp and F5 Networks Inc are scheduled to report first-quarter and fourth-quarter results, respectively. JDS Uniphase’s profit is expected to beat the average analyst estimate, according to StarMine data. F5 Networks is also expected to report results slightly above the average analyst estimate, according to StarMine.   Chipmakers RF Micro Devices Inc and Cirrus Logic Inc are expected to report second-quarter profit above estimates, according to StarMine data, helped by record sales of Apple’s iPhone 6.   Navigation equipment maker Garmin Ltd is expected to report third-quarter results slightly above analysts’ estimate, according to StarMine. The growth in Garmin’s fitness, aviation and other businesses in the past few quarters has offset a fall in sales of personal navigation devices. Investors will focus on sales of action camera Virb, which failed to resonate with customers after tough competition from GoPro.  IAC/Interactive Corp, the owner of internet brands such as Investopedia and About.com, is expected to post a third-quarter profit below estimates, according to StarMine data. The company’s search and applications business, which contributes to more than half of the company’s revenue, has seen slowing growth in the past few quarters and it has also been spending more on advertising expenses.  Take-Two Interactive Software Inc, the publisher of the blockbuster “Grand Theft Auto” games, will report second-quarter earnings. Investors will keep an eye out for digital sales during a seasonally quiet quarter and earnings guidance ahead of the launch of Grand Theft Auto V for Sony’s PlayStation4 and Xbox One consoles this holiday season.  Animation studio DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc is expected to report third-quarter revenue below estimates, according to StarMine. Investors will look for details on an SEC investigation along with expectations for “Penguins of Madagascar” - DreamWorks’ last movie for the year slated for release in November.   Shares of Shell Midstream Partners LP, a master limited partnership formed by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, are expected to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

276,MET,MetLife beats profit estimates as premiums rise,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N), the largest U.S. life insurer, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by higher premiums and gains tied to its derivatives program. The company’s shares were up about 3 percent at $53.49 in extended trading. Premiums rose 7 percent to $9.69 billion, while total operating revenue rose 6.5 percent to $17.92 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. “We delivered both top and bottom line growth, investment margins remained strong, and expenses were well controlled,” Chief Executive Steve Kandarian said in statement.  MetLife said earlier this month that it would fight a plan by the U.S. risk council to designate it as a firm whose demise could risk global finance, a tag that brings far greater regulatory scrutiny.  The U.S. risk council is considering designating MetLife as a non-bank systemically important financial institution (SIFI), the third insurer to be tapped for such a designation. AIG (AIG.N) and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) were designated as systemically important last year. On an operating basis, MetLife earned $1.60 per share in the third quarter, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MetLife has tried to scale back on capital-intensive businesses such as annuities to focus more on traditional life insurance and pension products. The company’s net profit rose to $2.06 billion, or $1.81 per share, in the quarter, from $942 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier.  MetLife’s profit in the latest quarter benefited from a $311 million derivative gain. MetLife, like other insurers, is heavily exposed to persistently low interest rates. But it has long had a substantial derivatives program designed to smooth out that risk.

277,MET,Investor to object to proposed $4.5 bln JPMorgan settlement,"NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A group of funds that threw a monkey wrench in Bank of America Corp’s proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage-backed securities will object to JPMorgan Chase & Co’s $4.5 billion offer to settle claims over similar investments, according to the lawyer that represents them. The funds, collateralized debt obligations known as the Triaxx entities, received court permission on Wednesday to intervene in a proceeding seeking judicial approval of the JPMorgan settlement, people close to the case said. JPMorgan last year reached the $4.5 billion agreement with some 20 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which the bank took over during the financial crisis. The settlement would resolve claims over misrepresentations in the quality of mortgages packaged into securities before the collapse of the U.S. housing market. The Triaxx entities hold certificates with an original balance of some $1.5 billion in 13 of the covered trusts, according to court papers. Their claims are “potentially worth far more than the small percentage of the $4.5 billion settlement than they would receive,” John Moon, an attorney for Triaxx, argued in the papers, filed in New York state court in Manhattan, seeking permission to intervene. Moon later told Reuters he planned to object to the deal. Triaxx is the second investor to raise questions about the accord. On Oct. 21, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which has holdings in 37 of the trusts in the proposed settlement, asked for a three-month extension of the Nov. 3 deadline to object. On Wednesday, Justice Marcy Friedman of New York state Supreme Court also allowed the bank to intervene, but did not change the deadline, people close to the case said. Friedman’s chambers declined to comment. In August, trustees overseeing the securities accepted the bank’s offer for the vast majority of the trusts. Some 20 investors agreed to the deal last year, including BlackRock Inc, Metlife Inc, Allianz SE’s Pacific Investment Management Company, and Bayerische Landesbank. Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investor group, did not immediately return a call for comment. In June 2011, Bank of America reached a similar deal with an investor group in which the bank agreed to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims involving securities issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America acquired in 2008. A New York judge largely approved the Bank of America deal in January, although she refused to accept a portion objected to by Triaxx, involving loan modifications. Triaxx has since dropped its opposition, as did American International Group Inc, which led objectors to the settlement in a three-year legal battle. An appeals court is still weighing the settlement on behalf of other objectors. Oral arguments were held last week. The case is In re: the application of U.S. Bank National Association, et al, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan), No. 652382/2014.

Scalia, a partner at law firm Gibson Dunn LLP who has successfully contested major decisions by regulators in the past, was seen walking into a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council with a MetLife delegation. When asked about Scalia’s presence in the group, which also included Chief Executive Steven Kandarian and Chief Financial Officer John Hele, a MetLife spokesman confirmed that the company had retained his services. FSOC, a group of top financial regulators, has proposed designating MetLife as a systemically important firm, which would subject it to oversight by the Federal Reserve, and impose tougher capital rules on it. MetLife on Monday had called for a closed-door meeting to challenge the decision by FSOC. After Monday’s meeting, FSOC has 60 days to make a final designation, which MetLife can then challenge in court. However, that decision of whether to mount a legal challenge had not been made yet, the spokesman said.",11032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-regulations-metlife-lawyer/exclusive-metlife-retains-top-washington-lawyer-in-regulator-fight-idUSKBN0IN21220141103
281,MET,RPT-MetLife to meet skeptical regulators in bid to escape rules,"(Repeats with no changes) By Douwe Miedema WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - MetLife, the largest U.S. insurer, will make a final plea on Monday to a group of U.S. regulators determined to subject it to tougher oversight as they probe which firms could pose a risk to the larger financial system. MetLife will meet behind closed doors the heads of the agencies grouped together in the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), who want the Federal Reserve to oversee MetLife’s business and force it to meet higher capital standards. Metlife, unlike counterparts AIG and Prudential  which have already been deemed “systemic” by FSOC, has vigorously fought the tag. After FSOC in September proposed to add MetLife to that group, the insurer’s chief executive Steven Kandarian hit back. He issued a statement saying MetLife was a source of strength during the 2008 financial crisis and that the insurer was “not ruling out any of the available remedies.” But observers say MetLife faces an uphill battle, especially after an international body of regulators had already deemed MetLife systemic on a global level in July 2013. “MetLife has a strong case on the substance ... but the FSOC is not likely to listen,” said Phillip Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy who was a senior Treasury official during the recent credit crisis. FSOC is housed within the Treasury Department, which also chairs the group, and is comprised of the leaders of all the major U.S. financial regulators. After hearing from MetLife on Monday, the first such in-person meeting between the insurer and the top regulators after months of staff-level talks, regulators will have 60 days for a final decision. MetLife can challenge the decision in court. Metlife declined to comment. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act automatically designated banks with more than $50 billion in assets as “systemically important financial institutions.” But it gave the risk council the power to also tap financial firms that are not banks, if they are so big and risky that their activities could destabilize U.S. markets. To date, the regulators who make up FSOC have not spoken publicly about MetLife. However, public documents justifying their designations of AIG and Prudential, and FSOC’s annual report, shed light on their concerns. The watchdogs worry insurers have their fingers in too many risky activities even after the credit crisis, and that they are no longer just straightforward providers of traditional life or car insurance policies. One issue likely to be weighed is captive reinsurance, an accounting practice through which life insurers can lower their reserves, or funds set aside to pay claims. In captive reinsurance, life insurance companies transfer risk to entities affiliated with their business in overseas jurisdictions or U.S. states with light-touch rules, which allows them to free up regulatory capital. Benjamin Lawsky, the New York Superintendent for Financial Services, has stopped issuing licenses for such activity, which he called “shadow insurance,” while Vermont and Delaware still actively court the business. In an apparent effort to reduce some scrutiny, MetLife last year announced it would merge three of its life insurance companies and a Bermuda-based captive reinsurance unit into one U.S.-based company, to “address regulatory concerns about the use of captive reinsurance.” Another point regulators have looked into is securities lending. Insurers hold huge portfolios of stocks and bonds that they often lend out, typically to broker-dealers or hedge funds, backed by collateral, in return for a small fee. This is generally seen as a low-risk activity, but played a key role in the near-collapse of AIG, which was reinvesting much of its collateral in often complex and risky instruments that rapidly lost their value when the crisis hit. Insurers say such risky behavior is a thing of the past, yet they continue to lend out considerable amounts of securities. MetLife’s securities lending portfolio ended 2013 at $28 billion, according to Moody’s Investors Service.

284,MET,UPDATE 1-U.S. risk council to meet with Wall St over designation concerns,"(Adds background, details on who will attend meetings) By Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. council of regulators that polices for destabilizing market risks is holding a series of private meetings with the financial industry to improve the process for designating large non-bank firms “systemic,” the U.S. Treasury confirmed Wednesday. The Financial Stability Oversight Council is holding a series of closed-door meetings, including several on Nov. 12, when industry groups will get to vent frustrations with the process the council uses to determine which firms pose high risks and should face heightened oversight. Some lawmakers and trade groups have complained the process is opaque and that firms do not have adequate time to contest a designation. The FSOC is a council of regulators chaired by the Treasury secretary and comprised of the heads of the top financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and has the power to designate large firms “systemic” - a tag that involves strict supervision by the Fed and higher capital requirements. The FSOC has already designated General Electric Co’s  GE Capital, Prudential Financial Inc and American International Group Inc. It recently proposed designating Metlife Inc, which is fiercely opposing the move. The council has also explored the asset management sector for potential risks. The FSOC has taken steps to address some concerns, and earlier this year adopted new standards such as providing more details from its closed-door meetings. FSOC officials including Treasury Secretary Jack Lew have said they are looking for further ways to improve the systemic designation process. A Treasury spokeswoman said upcoming discussions with stakeholders are “consistent” with the council’s prior commitment to explore further changes. The Treasury has divided the Nov. 12 meetings into three separate groups, according to several sources familiar with the matter. The first meeting will be with five major trade groups that earlier this year submitted a petition to the FSOC calling for changes in the process so companies under consideration can be notified sooner and have more options to contest a designation. The FSOC has a three-stage process to designate firms, but companies complain they do not get adequate data or notice to let them contest it or understand it. Those groups were the American Council of Life Insurers, the American Financial Services Association, the Association of Institutional Investors and the asset management group of the Securities and Financial Markets Association. The second meeting will be attended by other interested parties, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Investment Company Institute, while the third will involve academics or experts from think tanks. All participants were asked to come to the meeting prepared to discuss ways to improve transparency, the designation process and how companies are notified, and what things FSOC should consider each year when it re-evaluates whether companies should remain designated.

287,MET,Fitch Affirms MetLife's Ratings; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all existing ratings  assigned to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) and its subsidiaries, including the 'AA-'  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings assigned to certain domestic life  insurance companies and the 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) assigned to MetLife.  The Rating Outlook for MetLife and its subsidiaries is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of MetLife's ratings reflects Fitch's view that the company's  strong balance sheet fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very  strong market positions in several major insurance products lines and markets in  the U.S. and select international markets, are consistent with rating  expectations. Fitch believes that the company's large scale, very strong brand  name, and large and diverse distribution capabilities provide significant  competitive advantages. Fitch's primary rating concerns include MetLife's above-average, albeit  moderating, exposure to the variable annuity business; above average investment  risk; and continued macroeconomic challenges associated with the ongoing low  interest rate environment.  MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's strong  risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch notes that  the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations  are considered strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's  domestic life insurance subsidiaries (excluding American Life Insurance Company  and Delaware American Life Insurance Company) reported combined statutory total adjusted capital of  approximately $24 billion and risk-based capital of 430% at year-end 2013.  Although the company does not provide intra-year RBC estimates, Fitch notes that  the company's domestic life insurance subsidiaries reported combined statutory  net operating gain of approximately $2.7 billion in the first three quarters of  2014 and an estimated growth in total adjusted capital of $1.3 billion, or 5.6%.  MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest  insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory  solvency margin ratio significantly above 800% at year-end 2013, which is above  both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers.  The company's financial leverage was approximately 25% at Sept. 30, 2014, which  is at the high end of Fitch's rating expectations. Financial leverage has  declined from a recent high of approximately 30% in the third quarter of 2010,  shortly before its acquisition of ALICO. MetLife's GAAP interest coverage has improved significantly over the past five  years due primarily to solid growth in operating earnings. Interest expense has  also been slowly declining since 2011. Fitch expects MetLife's GAAP fixed charge  coverage ratio to be between 7x and 8x for full year 2014 on a normalized basis  on fairly stable earnings performance.  Despite the ongoing low interest rate environment, MetLife has experienced  significant improvement in operating earnings, bolstered in part by growing  asset-based fees driven by attractive capital market performance, relatively  stable interest margins, which have benefited from active management of  crediting rates and interest rate hedges, as well as international acquisition  activity, particularly its acquisition of ALICO in the fourth quarter 2010.  Fitch expects GAAP ROE to remain in the area of 12% in 2014 as continued growth  in fee income and solid earnings from International operations are at least  partially offset by pressure from low interest rates. MetLife's equity market exposure is primarily attributable to its investment in  alternative investments and the large, albeit declining size of its variable  annuity business. Fitch notes that the company's variable annuity hedging  program is robust and performed well during the financial crisis. However, the  hedging of variable annuity risk requires the company to make policyholder  behavior assumptions that may prove inaccurate. Deviations from pricing and  hedging assumptions could have a material negative impact on MetLife's capital  and earnings in a severe, albeit unexpected, scenario. On Sept. 4, 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Board (FSOC) announced that  it had voted to preliminarily designate MetLife a non-bank systematically  important financial institution (SIFI), which could result in more stringent  oversight by the Federal Reserve. MetLife subsequently requested a hearing to  contest the decision before it becomes final. Although the specifics of the  enhanced supervision to which non-bank SIFIs will be subject have not been  finalized, it is likely that it will include higher capital requirements. Should  MetLife's efforts to avoid SIFI designation ultimately prove unsuccessful, Fitch  expects such a designation to be credit neutral.

288,MET,"Metlife could disrupt markets if forced to sell illiquid assets, regulators say","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Insurer Metlife could disrupt markets if it was forced to sell off illiquid assets should it land into trouble, U.S. regulators said in a report on Friday, as they subjected the company to closer oversight. The Financial Stability Oversight Council voted 9-1 to tag the largest U.S. insurer as “systemically important,” bringing it under the purview of the Federal Reserve. It said that Metlife was so big that its failure could destabilize markets. Metlife’s leverage, a measure of how much it borrows relative to its own capital, was one of the highest of its peers, and it might not be able to quickly renew its short-term borrowings if it was in financial stress, the FSOC report added.

292,MET,Fitch: MetLife's SIFI Designation Is Credit Neutral,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 22 (Fitch) Last week's decision by the U.S. Financial  Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to designate MetLife (Insurer Financial  Strength: AA-, Stable Outlook) a nonbank systematically important financial  institution (SIFI) is neutral to the credit ratings of the company, says Fitch  Ratings.  The FSOC had already announced a preliminarily decision to designate MetLife a  nonbank SIFI on Sept. 4; thus, the FSOC's reaffirmation of the decision was  expected.  The specifics of the enhanced supervision to which nonbank SIFIs will be subject  have not been finalized, so it is not possible to determine precisely what  effect, if any, such requirements would have on MetLife. Fitch believes greater  Fed oversight would, however, likely include higher capital requirements, which  could eventually have some modest influence over MetLife's already strong  balance sheet fundamentals. Regardless, the capital-based thresholds that we  count among MetLife's multiple rating drivers are expected to remain consistent  with our prior views.   MetLife continues to openly contest its SIFI designation. The company requested  a hearing with the FSOC following the Sept. 4 announcement, and with Friday's  affirmation, MetLife again responded in disagreement, stating that the company  has 30 days to seek judicial review under the Dodd-Frank Act.  MetLife becomes the fourth nonbank SIFI designated by the FSOC, joining  Prudential, AIG and General Electric Capital Corporation, which were designated  in 2013. The council's authority to subject large nonbank financial institutions  to consolidated supervision and enhanced prudential standards is granted under  Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act. As noted in Fitch's affirmation of MetLife's credit ratings on Dec. 15, the key  rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of the company's ratings include an  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and a  GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  an NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and a  GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio below 5x.

293,MET,U.S. insurer MetLife to sue regulators over high-risk tag,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) on Tuesday sued U.S. regulators over a decision to subject the insurer to tougher oversight because it harbors enough risk to endanger the financial system if the next crisis hits. The largest U.S. life insurer unsuccessfully contested a ruling by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) last month, and a lawsuit is its last resort to escape being overseen by the U.S. Federal Reserve. “We just think that FSOC got this call wrong, and we believe that an appeal in this case is the right thing for our customers and for our other stakeholders,” MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steve Kandarian told Reuters in an interview. MetLife shares closed down 1.2 percent on Tuesday. The lawsuit will renew scrutiny of the process laid out in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which gives FSOC, the top U.S. risk council, the power to designate large financial companies as “systemically important,” imposing tougher rules and oversight by the Fed on them. The lawsuit is also important for large asset managers such as BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Fidelity Investments that could be added to the list of risky firms, though they have aggressively campaigned to avoid the FSOC designation. Lawmakers and companies alike have complained that the designation process is opaque and that the risks are not sufficient to warrant the tighter rules. “This is the first real challenge to the FSOC’s deeply flawed ... designation authority,” said U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican from North Carolina. “It is my hope this case will begin to shed some light on what metrics - if any - are used in the arbitrary and opaque FSOC review process.” Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who chairs FSOC, said last year the council may tweak its procedures. The council, comprised of the top U.S. regulators, plans to discuss potential reforms this month, a person familiar with the matter said. “The question we keep asking FSOC is, ‘how can you actually designate a company without knowing what the consequences are?’” said Alice Joe, a managing director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which houses the FSOC, said on Tuesday, “The council’s decision to designate a ... company is reached only after a thorough analysis and extensive engagement with the company, both of which occurred in this case. We are confident in the council’s work.” Regulators, in their decision to deem MetLife “systemic,” cited the firm’s large size, its range of activities in risky financial markets outside its core insurance business, and its connections to a raft of other companies, among other factors. In its complaint, MetLife gave several reasons why FSOC’s decision was “arbitrary and capricious,” the only way the law provides for it to win its case. Lawyers say this poses a high, though not insurmountable, hurdle. The decision was “fatally premature” because it will likely take the Fed months before it finalizes capital and other requirements for the industry, and a framework on how to cooperate with state regulators, the firm said. “It ... takes institutional courage to challenge the nine federal agencies that make up FSOC, even when you know that it is the right thing to do,” said Thomas Vartanian, a former regulator and a partner at Dechert LLP. Including MetLife, the Fed oversees almost one-third of the industry in the United States, a study by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, showed last year. MetLife was the third insurer designated by the FSOC as systemic. American International Group Inc (AIG.N), which almost collapsed during the credit meltdown, and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) chose not to fight the decision. Insurers say they do not harbor the same type of risks as banks, which make large loans to clients that they cannot get back on short notice during a financial crisis. The company also said it was denied several meetings with the regulators, and that it did not have access to information FSOC had used when looking at the other two insurers. MetLife filed its lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and has hired law firms Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. Eugene Scalia, a lawyer at Gibson Dunn, is on MetLife’s team. The son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, he has a track record of successfully fighting federal regulators. Scalia said the court would likely take nine months to a year to render its decision. “Sometimes regulatory agencies that are taking on new responsibilities falter at first, and need to learn through what can be a bit of trial and error,” Scalia said during a conference call with journalists.

296,MET,Breakingviews: MetLife's Snoopy takes on the regulatory Red Baron,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Challenging regulators can often come back to bite you in the rear. JPMorgan  proved this by publicly questioning the reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act and then privately failing to rein in some particularly naughty behavior by some of its traders. That’s what makes MetLife’s decision to take its watchdogs to court so surprising. The $900 billion insurer said on Tuesday that it will ask a federal judge to overturn its designation as a non-bank systemically important financial institution. That status was recently conferred on it by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is effectively the Justice League of America’s financial overseer. MetLife boss Steve Kandarian’s point is simple enough: “Size alone does not make a company systemic.” He’s right about that. The Dodd-Frank Act makes that clear enough. The legislation also created the right for firms to seek judicial review of SIFI designations. It’s easy to see why MetLife would want to avoid being called a SIFI. Granted, some banks may actually regard it as a weird badge of honor - it suggests they’re so important that nobody will let them fail. But it bestows no obvious benefit on an insurance company, which must match its assets with appropriate liabilities for its business model to function. Being labeled a SIFI may, though, require it to hold more capital. AIG proved in 2008 that it’s when an insurer acts like a bank that things go painfully awry - in AIG’s case an effectively insolvent savings and loan subsidiary with a feckless regulator. AIG’s business as an insurance company, big though it may have been, was not the source of systemic instability. As long as AIG, MetLife or Prudential, which was previously named a SIFI, behave like insurers the system should be relatively safe. It’s actually not all that different for banks, though the business of lending is inherently harder to forecast with actuarial precision than MetLife’s. JPMorgan’s blooper didn’t come from bad loans, though, but a series of derivative transactions by the bank’s poorly supervised chief investment office. The ensuing $6 billion loss meant previous objections to regulation made by the bank’s executives now rang hollow. As Kandarian acts like MetLife’s mascot Snoopy taking on the regulatory Red Baron, he had best hope he has a better handle on what his 65,000 employees are doing than Jamie Dimon did. - MetLife announced on Jan. 13 that it is to ask the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn its status as a non-bank systemically important financial institution. The Financial Stability Oversight Council conferred the designation last month.

298,MET,RPT-MetLife could further complicate Fed's new role as insurance cop,"(Repeating without changes) By Douwe Miedema and Michael Flaherty WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve’s new role as the top U.S. insurance regulator will be in the spotlight this week as MetLife decides whether to challenge tougher oversight by the central bank in court. The Fed would face months of scrutiny of its fledgling oversight of the sector if MetLife sues regulators over their decision to tag it as a firm that has the potential to destabilize the wider financial system. A lawsuit could also draw unwelcome attention from politicians warning of regulatory overreach, just as the Fed is getting its arms around the vast task of regulating the $1 trillion insurance industry. “Congress should ensure that changes in regulatory oversight do not negatively impact the insurance consumer,” said Representative Ed Royce, a Republican member of California. “For the first time in our history, we have the Federal Reserve, a traditional bank regulator, overseeing one-third of the insurance sector,” he told Reuters. With MetLife under its purview, the Fed now oversees insurers with 27 percent of total assets in the industry, a study by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, showed last year. Without MetLife, it is 19 percent. MetLife has until Friday to go to court over last month’s decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a group of regulators chaired by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, to designate it as “systemically important.” The company has retained Eugene Scalia, a top Washington lawyer with a track record of successfully challenging regulators in court, a sign that it may mount an attack in court, Reuters reported last month. Scalia and MetLife declined to comment. Large asset management firms also would also closely follow a lawsuit filed by MetLife. They have resisted being next in line to be brought under the Fed’s wings. Even without the headache of a MetLife lawsuit, the Fed has a large challenge before it, especially because the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law complicated the already-fragmented regulatory landscape. The post-crisis law created a largely advisory Federal Insurance Office and gave the Fed the ability to directly oversee the largest insurers, if the FSOC determined they posed a risk to the financial system.

299,MET,MetLife could further complicate Fed's new role as insurance cop,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve’s new role as the top U.S. insurance regulator will be in the spotlight this week as MetLife decides whether to challenge tougher oversight by the central bank in court. The Fed would face months of scrutiny of its fledgling oversight of the sector if MetLife sues regulators over their decision to tag it as a firm that has the potential to destabilize the wider financial system. A lawsuit could also draw unwelcome attention from politicians warning of regulatory overreach, just as the Fed is getting its arms around the vast task of regulating the $1 trillion insurance industry. “Congress should ensure that changes in regulatory oversight do not negatively impact the insurance consumer,” said Representative Ed Royce, a Republican member of California. “For the first time in our history, we have the Federal Reserve, a traditional bank regulator, overseeing one-third of the insurance sector,” he told Reuters. With MetLife under its purview, the Fed now oversees insurers with 27 percent of total assets in the industry, a study by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, showed last year. Without MetLife, it is 19 percent. MetLife has until Friday to go to court over last month’s decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a group of regulators chaired by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, to designate it as “systemically important.” The company has retained Eugene Scalia, a top Washington lawyer with a track record of successfully challenging regulators in court, a sign that it may mount an attack in court, Reuters reported last month.  Scalia and MetLife declined to comment. Large asset management firms also would also closely follow a lawsuit filed by MetLife. They have resisted being next in line to be brought under the Fed’s wings. Even without the headache of a MetLife lawsuit, the Fed has a large challenge before it, especially because the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law complicated the already-fragmented regulatory landscape. The post-crisis law created a largely advisory Federal Insurance Office and gave the Fed the ability to directly oversee the largest insurers, if the FSOC determined they posed a risk to the financial system.

302,MET,Breakingviews: MetLife SIFI suit is risk for harried watchdogs,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - MetLife is giving harried financial watchdogs yet another risk to ponder. U.S. courts have squelched a slew of securities and commodities rules. Designations of systemically important financial institutions, known as SIFIs, may be next, as the insurer with $900 billion of assets challenges its big-and-risky status. MetLife on Tuesday sued the Financial Stability Oversight Council for naming it a non-bank SIFI. The company argues the move was “fatally premature” because capital and other requirements for the insurance industry don’t even exist yet. That, says MetLife, makes FSOC’s behavior “arbitrary and capricious,” the legal standard for overturning agency rulemaking. It’s a high - but not insurmountable - hurdle. In 2011, for example, a federal appeals court struck down the Securities and Exchange Commission’s proxy access rule, which would have made it easier to challenge corporate boards. The court said the SEC hadn’t paid enough attention to the regulation’s potential economic effects. Another U.S. court ruled in 2013 that a Commodity Futures Trading Commission cap on certain transactions was ambiguous and insufficiently justified. And an appeals court decided last year that an SEC regulation violated companies’ free speech by requiring them to disclose whether their products contained specified African minerals. That ruling is under review. Financial watchdogs have in the past decade lost at least six challenges in the Washington, D.C. federal appeals court alone. Many investor advocates attribute the losses to Republican judges who until recently held a majority of the court’s seats. Yet some of the jurists ruling against the rules were Democratic appointees. It’s no coincidence that most of the questionable regulations were created pursuant to the Dodd-Frank financial reform. Sprawling post-crisis legislation passed under pressure can’t help but contain flaws, and rulemakers working in haste risk further sloppiness. The watchdogs have sometimes given the required cost-benefit analysis short shrift and too quickly dismissed the concerns of expert critics. The CFTC, for example, drew a harsh rebuke from judges for not bringing “its expertise and experience to bear.” Scrutiny will only grow more intense as banks and other companies, like MetLife, try to beat back regulation that might limit their business or increase their costs. That’s reason enough to make sure that rulemaking is as watertight as possible. - MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, on Jan. 13 asked the federal District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn its status as a non-bank systemically important financial institution. The Financial Stability Oversight Council conferred the designation last month. - In its legal complaint, MetLife listed several reasons why FSOC’s move was “arbitrary and capricious,” the standard for overturning regulatory decisions. Most notably, the insurer argued that the designation was “fatally premature,” because the Federal Reserve will probably take months to finalize capital and other requirements for the insurance industry.

305,MET,MetLife's profit beats estimates on investment gains,"(Reuters) - United State’s largest life insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit due to gains from investments and derivatives, reflecting falling interest rates and a rising dollar. MetLife reported net investment gains of $230 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $178 million a year earlier. The company gained $185 million from its derivatives program, compared with a loss of $373 million a year earlier. It uses derivatives to lower risks stemming from interest rates, currency exchange rates and equities. Net income from MetLife’s group insurance business more than doubled to $338 million in the quarter, helped by a recovering job market. With investments mainly in bonds, MetLife’s returns have been hurt by lower yields due to historically low interest rates. MetLife, which also invests insurance premiums in equities and mortgages, has been scaling back on capital-intensive businesses such as annuities to focus more on traditional life insurance and pension products. The company’s total operating revenue fell slightly to $18.25 billion. Net profit jumped to $1.49 billion, or $1.30 per share, from $877 million, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier.  On an operating basis, MetLife earned $1.38 per share. Analysts on average had expected $1.36 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MetLife is currently challenging in a federal court to overturn the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council’s decision to tag it “systemically important”, which imposes tougher rules and oversight by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The company was the third insurer to be designated after American International Group Inc (AIG.N), which almost collapsed during the credit meltdown, and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N).  AIG and Prudential did not fight the decision, but insurers say they do not harbor the same type of risks as banks.

MetLife had in January became the first nonbank to challenge a decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel led by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, that it qualified as a systemically important financial institution. The SIFI designation means regulators are concerned that a company’s failure, should it ever occur, might imperil the financial system. Companies with the designation are subjected to Federal Reserve oversight, and could face tighter capital and liquidity requirements that might impede growth and profits. In an evening filing with the federal court in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged that the life insurance business for which New York-based MetLife is best known did not alone result in the SIFI designation. But the department said MetLife was “significantly interconnected” with other financial companies through its institutional and capital markets activities and its insurance products. It also said the oversight council, whose authority to decide which companies are systemically important comes from the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, was not “arbitrary and capricious” in deciding that MetLife was systemically important. “MetLife’s numerous disagreements with the Council’s analysis and conclusions are meritless,” the government said. “MetLife’s complaints, if accepted, would frustrate the express statutory purpose of the Council: to address potential risks to financial stability posed by the distress of certain companies before that distress occurs and poses an imminent, grave threat to the nation’s economy.” In response to the filing, MetLife said: “Far from presenting systemic risk to the U.S. economy, MetLife is a source of financial stability. We strongly disagree with the arguments laid out by the government in its brief and look forward to responding in court next month.” Several banks have the SIFI designation. Nonbanks that have it include the insurers American International Group Inc  and Prudential Financial Inc, and General Electric Co’s  finance arm.

318,MET,Fitch Rates MetLife's Preferred Stock Issuance 'BBB',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to MetLife,  Inc.'s (MetLife) issuance of $1.5 billion in series C fixed-to-floating rate  non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch expects proceeds from the issuance to be used to redeem approximately $1.5  billion of 6.50% series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. Accordingly,  Fitch does not expect today's issuance to have a significant effect on the  credit profile of MetLife. The rating assigned to the new preferred shares is equivalent to the ratings  assigned to the preferred shares that will be redeemed with the proceeds, and  reflects standard notching for a hybrid with its risk characteristics. Fitch recently published an exposure draft of proposed changes to insurance  notching criteria, which includes notching of hybrid securities. Per Fitch  policies, newly assigned ratings are to be based on the proposed criteria. Fitch  assesses the hybrid rated today as having 'Minimal' non-performance risk under  the proposed criteria. Fitch notes the rating assigned to this hybrid would be  the same under both proposed and existing criteria. MetLife's ratings reflect Fitch's view that the company's strong balance sheet  fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very strong market positions  in several major insurance products lines and markets in the U.S. and select  international markets are consistent with rating expectations RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x. Fitch has assigned the following rating: MetLife, Inc.  --5.250% fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock 'BBB'. Contact: Primary Analyst Bradley S.

319,MET,MetLife accuses U.S. risk panel of secrecy; demands access to records,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - MetLife asked a federal judge on Monday to force the U.S. government to hand over 500 pages of confidential records that relate to financial regulators’ decision to designate the insurance giant as systemically important. In a filing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, MetLife said the government’s failure to hand over the records harms its “due-process rights.” MetLife is embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a panel of regulators chaired by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew that polices for emerging financial market risks and threats to stability. The panel has the power to dub large non-bank financial firms as systemically important, a tag that results in greater oversight by the Federal Reserve. MetLife has argued it is not systemically risky to the broader marketplace, and it is asking the court to overturn the FSOC’s determination. The FSOC has come under criticism in recent years by companies, lawmakers and even the Government Accountability Office that its decision-making process lacks adequate transparency. Although the FSOC does hold public meetings, much of its business is conducted behind closed doors, and companies have complained they have not received enough advanced warning when they were being considered for the designation of systemically important. The FSOC has made changes to address some of these criticisms, including giving companies more warning and more chances to offer feedback during the process. But MetLife says the FSOC has still refused to provide its outside lawyers all the documents about the designation, even though the panel has already made its final decision. MetLife said in Monday’s court filing that the FSOC is denying access to the records because of “information-sharing” arrangements it has with state insurance regulators about the company. MetLife argued that the FSOC should not be balking about cooperating because there is a protective order in place to ensure that only the company’s outside attorneys and the government - and not the general public or even the company itself - would be able to view any sensitive material. “This court should therefore direct FSOC to produce the withheld documents immediately so that MetLife can review all of the materials that the agency considered as part of its decision-making process and mount a fully informed challenge to FSOC’s designation determination,” the court filing says.

322,MET,MetLife profit falls on derivatives losses,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N), the biggest U.S. life insurer, reported a 21 percent fall in quarterly profit, dragged down by $593 million in derivatives losses. The company has long relied on its substantial derivatives program to hedge against risks that insurers are exposed to such as currency exchange rates, volatile equities markets and changes to interest rates. MetLife blamed rising interest rates and the weakening of the dollar against certain currencies for the after-tax derivatives losses in the quarter ended June 30. The company reported derivatives gain of $202 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income fell to 92 cents per share from $1.17. Operating profit rose 12 percent to $1.56 per share, bumped up 5 cents by a tax rate change in Japan. Analysts on average had expected $1.49 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Total operating revenue declined 2 percent to $17.36 billion due to a 4 percent drop in premiums, fees and other revenues.  “I think the biggest surprise was a bit of a slowdown in the retail business ... Compared to other product lines, this was weaker than I would expect,” Morningstar analyst Vincent Lui said. Operating earnings growth in the retail business slowed to 2 percent from 12 percent a year earlier. Premiums, fees & other revenues declined 2 percent to $3.3 billion as MetLife sold fewer income annuities.  MetLife has been scaling back on capital-intensive businesses such as annuities and focusing on traditional life insurance and pension products as it gears up for new capital rules. After years of delay, the U.S. Federal Reserve is drawing up nationwide capital standards for the $1-trillion insurance industry, in line with the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  Insurers fear they could become as heavily-regulated as the Wall Street banks and analysts have estimated that MetLife’s capital levels could drop by 50 percent in a worst-case scenario under the new rules. MetLife lowered its return on equity forecasts in May, partly due to uncertainty about the new rules.  Rival American International Group (AIG.N) is scheduled to report results on Monday. Up to Wednesday’s close of $57.22, MetLife’s shares had gained nearly 6 percent this year on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was largely unchanged in trading after the bell.

The company has long relied on its substantial derivatives program to hedge against risks that insurers are exposed to such as currency exchange rates, volatile equities markets and changes to interest rates.

326,MET,Fitch Affirms MetLife's Ratings; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all existing ratings  assigned to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) and its subsidiaries, including the 'AA-'  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings assigned to certain domestic life  insurance companies and the 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) assigned to MetLife.  The Rating Outlook for MetLife and its subsidiaries is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of MetLife's ratings reflects Fitch's view that the company's  strong balance sheet fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very  strong market positions in several major insurance products lines and markets in  the U.S. and select international markets, remain consistent with rating  expectations. Fitch believes that the company's large scale, very strong brand  name, and large and diverse distribution capabilities provide significant  competitive advantages. The ratings also consider MetLife's above average investment risk; and continued  macroeconomic challenges associated with the ongoing low interest rate  environment. Fitch views MetLife's designation by the Financial Stability  Oversight Council (FSOC) as a non-bank systematically important financial  institution (SIFI) to be credit neutral. MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's solid  risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch considers  the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations  strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's domestic life  insurance subsidiaries (excluding American Life Insurance Company and Delaware  American Life Insurance Company) reported combined statutory total adjusted  capital of approximately $25 billion and risk-based capital of 397% at year-end  2014. Although the company does not provide intra-year RBC estimates, the  company's domestic life insurance subsidiaries reported combined statutory net  operating gain of approximately $2.1 billion in first half 2015 and a very  modest decline in total adjusted capital.  MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest  insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory  solvency margin ratio significantly above 800% at year-end 2014, which is above  both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers. The company's financial leverage was approximately 26% at June 30, 2015, which  is within Fitch's expectations for the company's current ratings. Financial  leverage has declined from a recent high of approximately 30% in the third  quarter of 2010, shortly before its acquisition of ALICO, and is essentially  consistent with year-end 2014 levels. MetLife's GAAP interest coverage has improved significantly over the past five  years due primarily to solid growth in operating earnings and fairly stable  interest expense. Fitch expects MetLife's GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio to be  approximately 8x for full year 2015 on moderate earnings growth. Despite the ongoing low interest rate environment, MetLife has experienced  significant improvement in operating earnings, bolstered in part by growing  asset-based fees driven by attractive capital market performance; relatively  stable interest margins, which have benefited from active management of  crediting rates and interest rate hedges; as well as international acquisition  activity, particularly its acquisition of ALICO in the fourth quarter 2010.  Fitch expects GAAP ROE to remain in the area of 12% in 2015 as continued growth  in fee income and solid earnings from International operations are at least  partially offset by continued pressure from low interest rates. MetLife's equity market exposure is primarily attributable to its investment in  alternative investments and the large size of its variable annuity business. The  company's variable annuity hedging program is robust and performed well during  the financial crisis. However, the hedging of variable annuity risk requires the  company to make policyholder behavior assumptions that may prove inaccurate.  Deviations from pricing and hedging assumptions could have a material negative  impact on MetLife's capital and earnings in a severe, albeit unexpected,  scenario. On Dec. 18, 2014, FSOC announced that it had reached a final determination to  designate MetLife a non-bank SIFI, which could result in more stringent  oversight by the Federal Reserve. On Jan. 13, 2015, MetLife filed an action in  the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn the  designation. Although the specifics of the enhanced supervision to which  non-bank SIFIs will be subject have not been finalized, it is likely that they  will include higher capital requirements. Should MetLife's efforts to overturn  the FSOC decision ultimately prove unsuccessful, Fitch would view such a  development to be credit neutral. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x.

329,MET,Fitch Affirms MetLife's Ratings; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all existing ratings  assigned to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) and its subsidiaries, including the 'AA-'  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings assigned to certain domestic life  insurance companies and the 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) assigned to MetLife.  The Rating Outlook for MetLife and its subsidiaries is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of MetLife's ratings reflects Fitch's view that the company's  strong balance sheet fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very  strong market positions in several major insurance products lines and markets in  the U.S. and select international markets, remain consistent with rating  expectations. Fitch believes that the company's large scale, very strong brand  name, and large and diverse distribution capabilities provide significant  competitive advantages. The ratings also consider MetLife's above-average investment risk and continued  macroeconomic challenges associated with the ongoing low interest rate  environment. Fitch views MetLife's designation by the Financial Stability  Oversight Council (FSOC) as a non-bank systematically important financial  institution (SIFI) to be credit neutral. MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's solid  risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch considers  the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations  to be strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's domestic life  insurance subsidiaries (excluding American Life Insurance Company and Delaware  American Life Insurance Company) reported combined statutory total adjusted  capital of approximately $25 billion at year-end 2014, which Fitch estimates  resulted in consolidated risk-based capital of 384%. Although the company does  not provide intra-year RBC estimates, the company's domestic life insurance  subsidiaries reported combined statutory net operating gain of approximately  $1.4 billion in first nine months of 2015 and an increase of approximately $1  billion in total adjusted capital.  MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest  insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory  solvency margin ratio significantly above 800% at year-end 2014, which is above  both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers. The company's financial leverage was approximately 26% at Sept. 30, 2015, which  is within Fitch's expectations for the company's current ratings. Financial  leverage has declined from approximately 30% in the third quarter of 2010  (3Q10), shortly before its acquisition of ALICO, and is essentially consistent  with year-end 2014 levels. MetLife issued $1.25 billion of senior notes in  November 2015, and Fitch expects proceeds from the issuance to be used for  general corporate purposes, including funding debt maturities in 2016. As a  result of 2016 maturities, Fitch considers the new issuance to be neutral to  financial leverage. Fitch considers MetLife's GAAP interest coverage to be strong, reflecting solid  operating performance and fairly stable interest expense. Fitch expects  MetLife's GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio to be between 7.5x and 8.0x for  full-year 2015. Despite the ongoing low interest rate environment, MetLife has continued to  generate solid operating earnings in recent years, bolstered in part by growing  asset-based fees driven by favorable equity market performance; relatively  stable interest margins, which have benefited from active management of  crediting rates and interest rate hedges; as well as international acquisition  activity, particularly its acquisition of ALICO in 4Q10. Excluding the company's  $792 million charge in 3Q15 related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned  U.K.-based investment subsidiary, Fitch expects GAAP ROE to remain in the area  of 12% for full year 2015 and decline modestly to between 11% and 12% in 2016 as  continued growth in fee income and solid earnings from International operations  are at least partially offset by continued pressure from low interest rates. MetLife's equity market exposure is primarily attributable to its investment in  alternative investments and the large size of its variable annuity business. The  company's variable annuity hedging program is robust and performed well during  the financial crisis. However, the hedging of variable annuity risk requires the  company to make policyholder behavior assumptions that may prove inaccurate.  Deviations from pricing and hedging assumptions could have a material negative  impact on MetLife's capital and earnings in a severe, albeit unexpected,  scenario. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x.

331,MET,UPDATE 2-MetLife plans to split off U.S. retail business; shares rise,"(Adds background, context) Jan 12 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, plans to separate a substantial portion of its U.S. retail business from the core company, saying on Tuesday that the “regulatory environment” helped drive its decision. MetLife is considering various approaches for splitting off the retail business, including an initial public offering, a spinoff or a sale. The business sells life insurance and other financial products across the United States, generating at least one fifth of MetLife earnings. The company’s shares rose 8 percent to $45.06 in after-market trading on Tuesday following the announcement. MetLife is currently in a legal tangle over federal regulators designating it a “systemically important financial institution,” or SIFI, in 2014. That label, created after the massive financial crisis that started in 2007, means regulators deem the company too big to fail and triggers a requirement for MetLife to hold higher levels of capital. Last January, the insurer asked a U.S. District Court to throw out the designation. MetLife’s Chief Executive Steven Kandarian said in a statement on Tuesday the lagging retail section “risks higher capital requirements that could put it at a significant competitive disadvantage.” “Even though we are appealing our SIFI designation in court and do not believe any part of MetLife is systemic, this risk of increased capital requirements contributed to our decision,” he added. “An independent company would benefit from greater focus, more flexibility in products and operations, and a reduced capital and compliance burden.” Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is currently pressuring American International Group Plc., another insurer designated systemically important, to break itself up for many of the same reasons. MetLife said that if made an initial public offering for the separate company, it would file a registration statement in approximately six months. The new company, to be led by executive vice president Eric Steigerwalt, will not house certain parts of the U.S. retail segment, including the life insurance closed block and property-casualty units. It would represent about 20 percent of Metlife’s operating earnings and have approximately $240 billion in total assets, based on September data, the company said. Growth in MetLife’s U.S. retail business has been slowing, with the unit reporting an operating income of $523 million in the third quarter, down 33 percent from a year earlier. In the second quarter, retail’s operating earnings growth slowed to 2 percent from 12 percent a year earlier. The company’s shares fell about 11 percent in 2015.

334,MET,Fitch: MetLife Move Has Implications for Global Insurers,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 13 (Fitch) MetLife's proposed restructuring announced Tuesday  has important implications for the life insurance industry, which faces  significant competitive and regulatory pressures in the U.S. and globally, says  Fitch Ratings. The move demonstrates how the evolving regulatory environment  affects the industry's capital management and operating strategies. The prospect  of increasing regulatory capital requirements associated with MetLife's nonbank  systemically important financial institution (SIFI) designation weighed heavily  in its decision.  MetLife is pursuing a separation of a substantial portion of its U.S. retail  life and annuity business that would be subject to enhanced capital requirements  under yet-to-be-announced U.S. nonbank SIFI prudential standards. MetLife will  no longer write new U.S. retail life and annuity business -- a significant  strategic shift for the firm. The U.S. business to be divested represents  approximately 20% of the operating earnings of the firm globally and 50% of its  U.S. retail operating earnings.  While the SIFI designation applies to only two other U.S. life insurers to date  (Prudential and AIG), the threat of higher regulatory capital requirements could  lead to further restructuring initiatives by U.S. life insurers, as well as  non-U.S. insurers designated as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII).  Rating implications for moves such as MetLife's could be mixed based on the  structure and nature of the disposition of more risky, market-sensitive  businesses, among many potential considerations.   Fitch believes that inclusion on the list of G-SIIs will continue to play a  significant role in setting strategy for global insurers. Already, one European  insurer, Generali, was removed in November 2015, while Aegon was added. The  Financial Stability Board did not explain its rationale for the change, but we  believe it was driven by how these firms are exposed to nontraditional business,  which includes some market-sensitive products.  MetLife is the second of the four nonbank SIFIs in the U.S. to elect a  significant asset disposal to mitigate the implications of its systemically  important designation. GE, the first such firm, is disposing of its  middle-market lending business and other wholesale funding dependent businesses  within its GE Capital arm. None of the eight U.S. banks with SIFI designations  have made moves quite as significant as MetLife and GE, but certain  disincentives for becoming larger have been firmly established for banks, mostly  though the global systemically important bank capital buffers, the Comprehensive  Capital Analysis and Review program and the U.S. adoption of Basel III capital  standards.  It remains unclear if the proposed restructuring will result in MetLife shedding  its SIFI designation as the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council has not  yet to provide an ""exit ramp"" for designated firms. MetLife has challenged its  SIFI designation in court. Fitch expects regulatory uncertainty around this  issue to persist into 2017.

349,MET,U.S. judge strikes down MetLife designation of 'too big to fail',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N) won a major regulatory and legal battle on Wednesday when a federal judge struck down the U.S. government’s determination that it is “too big to fail.” MetLife had argued in court that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), made up of the heads of the country’s financial regulatory agencies, used a secretive and flawed process when in 2014 it designated the company as a systemically important financial institution.  The designation meant regulators believed a collapse of the insurer could devastate the U.S. financial system just as much as failure of a major bank, and triggered possible requirements for it to hold more capital and for stricter oversight. “From the beginning, MetLife has said that its business model does not pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States,” the company’s chief executive, Steven Kandarian, said in a statement.  A representative for the U.S. Treasury said the agency  disagreed with the decision and would vigorously defend the council’s designations process. “FSOC conducted a rigorous analysis of MetLife, including extensive engagement with the company, and determined that material financial distress at MetLife could pose ... a threat to the financial system,” said spokesman Adam Hodge.  The ruling by the judge, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, is currently sealed, but parts may be made public next month, according to Wednesday’s order, which also said the federal government may appeal. During a hearing last month, Collyer expressed concerns about the process and the analyses that the council, which includes the Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chair, uses to make designations. [nL2N15P0TZ] In the order, Collyer granted three of the reasons, or counts, that MetLife gave when it argued against the designation. The company had said there were flaws in how the FSOC assessed its vulnerabilities, that some of the FSOC’s assumptions and speculations were arbitrary and capricious, and that the FSOC had not given enough consideration of the designation’s economic effects on MetLife. MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, said earlier this year it was considering breaking up its business to shed the designation. Its shares ended up more than 5 percent on the news, at $44.73. Those of other insurers designated systemically important, Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) and American International Group Inc (AIG.N), also rose.  “It’s a major win for companies placed under this designation. It’s a very large blow for the FSOC. But FSOC can appeal,” said Raymond James analyst Steven Schwartz. “It’s not over until it’s over.” Deutsche Bank Markets Research analyst Yaron Kinar wrote in a note that because of potential appeals the company’s status may not “be finalized for some time” and “we’d expect the company to continue down the path of separating its U.S. retail business despite the ruling.”  Asset managers greeted the decision as good news with the potential to soften future regulation that their industry has been expecting. Earlier this month, the FSOC said it was discussing how to address the risks that their products could pose to financial stability. [nL2N16T22N]    The nonprofit, nonpartisan group Better Markets said, however, Collyer’s decision threatens “the entire structure that protects the country and its taxpayers from future financial crashes caused by nonbanks.” The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law authorized regulators to designate nonbank companies as “systemically important,” largely in response to the $182 billion government bailout AIG received during the 2008 financial crisis.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to comment on the decision, but said crisis-era bailouts showed “it’s not just banks on Wall Street that could potentially shake the foundation of our financial system.” “And if we’re serious - and the president certainly is -about following through on a commitment to make sure that taxpayers are never in that position again, we need to make sure that our regulators ... can exercise, at least, some authority over nonbank institutions,” he said at a White House briefing. MetLife sued last year, saying the FSOC had not followed its own guidance and essentially changed the rules to ensure the designation was made. The government argued its process was fair and a collapse by the insurer, with its many financial ties, products and contracts, would indeed hurt the financial system.

MetLife and other financial stocks led the market higher while the S&P; energy sector was down marginally after crude prices retreated from their day’s highs after a report showed a weekly build in U.S. crude inventories. Yellen said on Tuesday the U.S. central bank should proceed cautiously as it looks to raise interest rates. On Wednesday, her comments were echoed by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who said there was a high hurdle to raising rates in April, given low inflation. Those comments soothed investors worried about a slow global economy, a strong dollar, volatile oil prices and lackluster top-line growth at U.S. companies. “The market’s best friend continues to be the Fed and central banks around the world,” said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Investor appetite for risk has increased.” Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they reduce lending and investment and make it harder for companies to expand. A sputtering global economy and strong dollar have already been causing earnings of U.S. companies to shrink and many investors want the Fed to hold off raising rates until after its meetings in April and June. The S&P; 500 gained 0.44 percent to 2,063.97 points, bringing its gain for 2016 to about 1 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.42 percent at 17,707.76 points and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.49 percent to 4,870.15. MetLife’s shares rose 4.7 percent after a court ruled that the life insurer was not systemically important to the country’s financial system. The tag “too big to fail” requires more stringent regulations. Fellow insurers AIG and Prudential Financial  added more than 1 percent. Apple rose 1.9 percent after Cowen & Co raised its rating on the stock to “outperform”. The stock gave the biggest boost to the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,033 to 956. On the Nasdaq, 1,858 issues rose and 928 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 54 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 69 new highs and 19 new lows.

Oil prices retreated from their day’s highs after a report showed a weekly build in U.S. crude inventories. Yellen, in her first remarks since the Fed held steady on rates earlier this month, said the central bank should tread cautiously on raising rates this year. Yellen’s stance contrasts with recent comments from other policymakers who have voiced support for more than one increase this year. Markets around the world cheered Yellen’s remarks, which suggested that a rate hike was not immediately on the horizon. The dollar fell more than a percent, while bond prices rallied. The rally was driven by Yellen’s comments but the upcoming corporate earnings season would be the real test for stocks, said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer of Bryn Mawr Trust in Devon, Pennsylvania. “In order to sustain the strength in the equity market, you’re going to have to see some decent earnings growth at some point,” Cecilia said. Declining earnings growth has been a major factor for stocks as a sputtering global economy weighs on balance sheets. Data by payrolls processor ADP on Wednesday showed the U.S. private sector added more jobs than expected in March, indicating continued improvement in the U.S. labor market. The report is a precursor to the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data on Friday. At 12:34 p.m. ET (1634 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 84.99 points, or 0.48 percent, at 17,718.1, the S&P; 500 was up 9.87 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,064.88 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 22.35 points, or 0.46 percent, at 4,868.98. All 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by a 0.87 percent rise in the financial sector. Metlife gave the sector its biggest boost. Metlife’s shares were up 5 percent at $44.57 after a court ruled that the life insurer was not systemically important to the country’s financial system. The tag “too big to fail” would have brought the company under more stringent regulations. Fellow insurers AIG and Prudential Financial  were up more than 2 percent.

355,MET,U.S. district judge strikes down designation of MetLife as 'too big to fail',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer on Wednesday struck down the designation made by the heads of the country’s financial regulatory agencies that major insurer MetLife Inc is systemically important to the U.S. financial system. MetLife had argued in court that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) used a secretive and flawed process when, in 2014, it determined that a collapse of the insurer could devastate the U.S. financial system just as much as failure of a major bank such as Citigroup. Collyer’s opinion is currently sealed, but parts may be made public next month, according to the judge’s order, which also said the federal government may appeal. The decision, a major defeat for the council, was a boost to the largest U.S. life insurer, which had said earlier this year it was considering breaking up its business to shed the designation of being “too big to fail.” Its shares rose nearly 8 percent on the news, to $45.84, and could close at its highest level in more than four years. Shares of other insurers designated systemically important rose, as well. Prudential Financial Inc rose 2.8 percent and American International Group Inc was up 2.3 percent. At the heart of the case is whether the government can designate non-banks as systemically important. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law authorized the U.S. to designate banks as ‘systemically important’ after AIG received a government bailout of $182 billion during the 2008 financial meltdown. MetLife sued the council last year. It said the council, which includes the Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve Chair, had not followed its own guidance on designating a firm as systemically important, essentially changing the rules to ensure the determination was made. In court in February, the federal government argued its process was fair and that a collapse by the insurer, with its many financial ties, products and contracts, would indeed hurt the financial system. It said it was open with the company during a 17-month process that included exchange of thousands of pages of documents and several meetings, including one with the full council. Representatives of MetLife and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

359,MET,MetLife ruling bolsters other firms arguing systemic unimportance,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge’s ruling that MetLife Inc is not important enough to warrant special regulatory scrutiny has opened the door for other non-bank financial firms to try and unshackle themselves from the designation of “too big to fail.” Those that stand to benefit from Wednesday’s decision include insurers Prudential Financial Inc and American International Group Inc, as well as General Electric Co’s GE Capital and asset managers like BlackRock Inc, Fidelity Investments and The Vanguard Group Inc. Metlife, Prudential, AIG and GE Capital are the only four non-banks that have been deemed systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard have not been assigned systemic importance, but analysts and regulatory experts say they are large enough to merit consideration. It is difficult to assess whether any of these firms can avoid a “too big to fail” classification forever because the criteria are fluid and SIFI assessments start fresh every year. As such, even MetLife’s victory may be short-lived. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, known as FSOC, is comprised of members from 15 regulatory bodies, 10 of which have a vote on matters including SIFI designations. The council was created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Its SIFI designations are meant to add an extra layer of oversight on firms that could cause a system-wide financial crisis if they get into trouble, because of how large and interconnected they are. FSOC has been plagued by criticism about opaqueness nearly since its birth, even as it has taken steps to address complaints. In 2014 the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, criticized FSOC’s “lack of full transparency,” saying FSOC did not always disclose public documents or explain the rationale for SIFI designations. Republican lawmakers have also lashed out at FSOC for not sharing enough information. The council has taken corrective measures, both in its public disclosures and in the way it interacts with companies. At an event last year, GE Capital Chief Executive Keith Sherin called GE Capital’s designation as a systemically important institution “very clear” and “very understandable.” In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, which chairs FSOC, said the council also has a “clear process” for removing SIFI designations. It includes discussions between FSOC staff and company officials, as well as independent analysis of changes within companies or across markets, he said. Overall, the council aims to determine whether “a firm’s distress could destabilize the financial system,” he said. Size is certainly one factor in determining which firms are “too big to fail,” but it is not the only one, regulatory experts say. For instance, AIG’s near failure in 2008 created a system-wide panic not because it was large, but because of its connections to dozens of other firms through derivatives trades. But while complexity and interconnectivity may be even more important than size, defining precisely what those words mean is not an easy task. One big question posed by analysts and regulatory experts is whether FSOC would consider mutual fund firms systemically risky because investors could rush to redeem their shares at the same time. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer’s opinion in the MetLife case is currently sealed. But in her order, she pointed to arguments that FSOC’s assessment of MetLife was flawed, that some of its assumptions were “arbitrary and capricious” and that it did not give enough consideration to how the SIFI designation would affect MetLife financially. It is not clear whether FSOC will appeal the decision, but regardless of how the litigation proceeds MetLife may not be out of the woods. FSOC makes its determinations on an annual basis, and can simply designate MetLife as a SIFI again in its next iteration. That could set up a scenario where MetLife and the council are in an endless legal battle - which is partly why other firms declined to pursue litigation the way MetLife did. AIG’s chief executive said in a television interview on Thursday that the insurer is considering whether to dispute its designation in light of the MetLife ruling. Coincidentally, GE Capital asked FSOC on Thursday to de-designate it because it had taken steps to shrink and simplify. The company has been planning to do this for some time, after exiting businesses, selling assets and shrinking its balance sheet by more than half to get out from under the SIFI designation. BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity representatives declined to comment on the MetLife decision. Some analysts said GE’s strategy was a wiser one than MetLife’s, because rather than fighting a powerful group of regulators in court, it adapted to become “not-too-big-to-fail” in response to FSOC’s analysis of its business model. “GE Capital no longer poses a major threat to U.S. financial stability,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray, “and we believe the federal review is almost a formality at this point.” ",3312016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-size/metlife-ruling-bolsters-other-firms-arguing-systemic-unimportance-idUSL2N1732B1

361,MET,U.S. judge strikes down MetLife designation of 'too big to fail',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N) won a major regulatory and legal battle on Wednesday when a federal judge struck down the U.S. government’s determination that it is “too big to fail.” MetLife had argued in court that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), made up of the heads of the country’s financial regulatory agencies, used a secretive and flawed process when in 2014 it designated the company as a systemically important financial institution.  The designation meant regulators believed a collapse of the insurer could devastate the U.S. financial system just as much as failure of a major bank, and triggered possible requirements for it to hold more capital and for stricter oversight. “From the beginning, MetLife has said that its business model does not pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States,” the company’s chief executive, Steven Kandarian, said in a statement.  A representative for the U.S. Treasury said the agency  disagreed with the decision and would vigorously defend the council’s designations process. “FSOC conducted a rigorous analysis of MetLife, including extensive engagement with the company, and determined that material financial distress at MetLife could pose ... a threat to the financial system,” said spokesman Adam Hodge.  The ruling by the judge, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, is currently sealed, but parts may be made public next month, according to Wednesday’s order, which also said the federal government may appeal. During a hearing last month, Collyer expressed concerns about the process and the analyses that the council, which includes the Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chair, uses to make designations. [nL2N15P0TZ] In the order, Collyer granted three of the reasons, or counts, that MetLife gave when it argued against the designation. The company had said there were flaws in how the FSOC assessed its vulnerabilities, that some of the FSOC’s assumptions and speculations were arbitrary and capricious, and that the FSOC had not given enough consideration of the designation’s economic effects on MetLife. MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, said earlier this year it was considering breaking up its business to shed the designation. Its shares ended up more than 5 percent on the news, at $44.73. Those of other insurers designated systemically important, Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) and American International Group Inc (AIG.N), also rose.  “It’s a major win for companies placed under this designation. It’s a very large blow for the FSOC. But FSOC can appeal,” said Raymond James analyst Steven Schwartz. “It’s not over until it’s over.” Deutsche Bank Markets Research analyst Yaron Kinar wrote in a note that because of potential appeals the company’s status may not “be finalized for some time” and “we’d expect the company to continue down the path of separating its U.S. retail business despite the ruling.”  Asset managers greeted the decision as good news with the potential to soften future regulation that their industry has been expecting. Earlier this month, the FSOC said it was discussing how to address the risks that their products could pose to financial stability. [nL2N16T22N]    The nonprofit, nonpartisan group Better Markets said, however, Collyer’s decision threatens “the entire structure that protects the country and its taxpayers from future financial crashes caused by nonbanks.” The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law authorized regulators to designate nonbank companies as “systemically important,” largely in response to the $182 billion government bailout AIG received during the 2008 financial crisis.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to comment on the decision, but said crisis-era bailouts showed “it’s not just banks on Wall Street that could potentially shake the foundation of our financial system.” “And if we’re serious - and the president certainly is -about following through on a commitment to make sure that taxpayers are never in that position again, we need to make sure that our regulators ... can exercise, at least, some authority over nonbank institutions,” he said at a White House briefing. MetLife sued last year, saying the FSOC had not followed its own guidance and essentially changed the rules to ensure the designation was made. The government argued its process was fair and a collapse by the insurer, with its many financial ties, products and contracts, would indeed hurt the financial system. It said it was open with the company during a 17-month process that included a meeting with the full council. [nL2N15P0TZ] At the same time, criticism of the council has mounted in the financial sector and on Capitol Hill, where Republicans say regulators should operate more openly. Securities and Exchange  Commissioner Michael Piwowar, also a Republican, has blasted the council, saying it should be renamed the “Firing Squad On Capitalism.” [nL1N13X257] ",3312016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-metlife/u-s-judge-strikes-down-metlife-designation-of-too-big-to-fail-idUSKCN0WW1RW
362,MET,AIG CEO says MetLife 'too big to fail' ruling an opportunity,"(Reuters) - A judge’s ruling that MetLife Inc (MET.N) is not “too big to fail” opens up an opportunity for insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) to seek an exemption from the tag, AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock said on CNBC on Thursday. However, Hancock said AIG was “reserving judgment” for now. AIG’s near collapse in 2008 and its $182 billion bailout by the U.S. government was the driving force behind the inclusion of certain non-bank financial companies, including AIG, as “systemically important financial institutions” (SIFIs). The SIFI designation means regulators believe a collapse of the company could devastate the U.S. financial system just as much as the failure of a major bank and comes with increased regulatory oversight and capital requirements. Hancock, who said “the whole world was somewhat surprised” by the MetLife ruling, noted that AIG had shrunk its balance sheet, giving it a strong case to get its SIFI tag removed. AIG’s mortgage insurance unit, United Guaranty Corp, filed for an initial public offering on Wednesday as part of AIG’s plan to become smaller. The company also plans to sell its broker-dealer network. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who is AIG’s fifth largest shareholder, has been pushing the insurer to become smaller and simpler to allow it to shed its label as a non-bank SIFI. General Electric Co’s (GE.N) GE Capital, another non-bank, formally asked the U.S. government on Thursday to stop designating it a SIFI. Shares of AIG, which have fallen 12 percent so far this year, were little changed at $54.55 in premarket trading.

382,MET,"MetLife profit misses on weak returns from hedge funds, bonds","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N), the largest U.S. life insurer, reported a quarterly operating profit that fell far short of expectations as income from investments in hedge funds and bonds declined. American International Group Inc (AIG.N), the No. 1 U.S. commercial insurer, earlier reported a lower-than-expected profit for the third straight quarter as poor returns from hedge funds hurt investment income. Both companies, like their rivals, have been hurt by near-zero interest rates since the financial crisis. New York-based MetLife, whose shares were down 1.6 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, said its net operating profit fell 19 percent to $1.33 billion, or $1.20 per share, in the three months ended March 31. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of $1.38 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was the third straight quarter of lower-than-expected earnings. Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N), the No. 2 U.S. life insurer, reported a 23.2 percent fall in operating profit on Wednesday as its revenue from premiums fell. MetLife’s net investment income, which includes returns from investments in bonds, fell 5.5 percent to $4.71 billion in the quarter. Variable investment income more than halved to $109 million, hit by weak returns from hedge fund investments. MetLife won a major battle in March when a judge struck down the U.S. government’s determination that it was “too big to fail”, a designation that would likely require the insurer to boost its capital. The government is appealing. Chief Executive Steven Kandarian said in January that the “regulatory environment” had driven MetLife to consider splitting off its retail business as higher capital requirements could put the company at a “significant competitive disadvantage.” MetLife shares were trading at $43.24 after the bell. Up to Wednesday’s close, the stock had fallen nearly 9 percent this year.

389,MET,U.S. strikes back at judge's decision that MetLife not 'too big to fail',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government laid out its arguments against a federal judge’s decision to strike down the designation of life insurer MetLife Inc as “too big to fail” in a brief filed late on Thursday, showing how it intends to defend a key provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. MetLife sued the U.S. government last year, saying the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), made up of the chiefs of U.S. financial regulatory agencies, used a flawed process in determining it could hurt the U.S. financial system if it faced financial distress. On March 30, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer rescinded the designation and the federal government appealed in the U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C. “The district court’s ruling in this case overturned the collective judgment of the heads of every U.S. financial regulatory agency and left one of the largest financial companies in the world subject to even less oversight than before the financial crisis,” a Treasury spokesman said in a statement on Thursday, adding the government plans to “vigorously defend” the FSOC’s work. MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, has until August to respond and oral arguments are expected in the autumn. Both sides say the case could reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Collyer’s decision centered on the analysis FSOC conducted to make its 2014 determination that MetLife is a “systemically important financial institution.” Saying that it had failed to review the likelihood that MetLife would fail, and in view of potential losses to counterparties, and costs imposed on MetLife by the label, she called the determination “arbitrary and capricious.” Passed after the financial crisis of 2008-2009 - which was aggravated by the way in which many large financial institutions were inter-connected - Dodd-Frank created the FSOC and gave it the power to label firms as systemically important, which triggers requirements to hold more capital and abide by other regulations. Collyer’s decision exempts MetLife from the regulations governing systemically important insurers that the Federal Reserve has proposed. In its brief, the government said the council is not required to consider the likelihood of failure or “estimate specific counterparty losses or produce quantitative projections of the harm that would result.” “The 2008-2009 financial crisis demonstrated that the sudden, unforeseen failures of large financial companies can have sweeping, unpredictable ramifications,” it added. It also said Dodd-Frank does not call for a cost-benefit analysis, and instead focuses “on risk to the nation’s financial stability rather than on costs to large financial companies.”",6172016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-metlife/u-s-strikes-back-at-judges-decision-that-metlife-not-too-big-to-fail-idUSL1N1990E2
390,MET,"Dodd, Frank blast ruling that MetLife not too big to fail","(Reuters) - A federal court’s striking down of the government’s designation of insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N) as “too-big-to-fail” could undermine efforts to head off another financial crisis, authors of the landmark Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law said. In a brief filed on Thursday with a federal appeals court, former Senator Chris Dodd, former Representative Barney Frank and 18 other heavyweight Democrats including Representative Nancy Pelosi said the decision could make it difficult to prevent another “calamitous financial meltdown.”   At the same time, Ben Bernanke, who chaired the Federal Reserve during the 2007-2009 crisis, and Paul Volcker, another former Fed chairman who helped craft Dodd-Frank, filed a brief.  A major consequence of the decision “is that one of the world’s largest, most highly interconnected financial institutions is left with inadequate oversight,” they wrote. In March U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer rescinded the government’s 2014 designation of MetLife as a systematically important financial institution.  Dodd-Frank had created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, consisting of the heads of regulatory agencies, in part to identify firms that could wreck the U.S. financial system if they experience distress. The council’s designations trigger stricter regulatory oversight and requirements to hold more capital. Collyer called the MetLife designation “arbitrary and capricious,” saying the council never adequately assessed the risk of Metlife’s failure and neglected to perform a cost-benefit analysis of applying the designation. The council laid out its arguments for its appeal of the decision in a brief filed last week. “The broad array of legislators, policy officials, economists, insurance experts and other scholars who filed in support of FSOC makes clear that FSOC’s designation of MetLife fully complied with the law and applied the lessons of the financial crisis,” said a Treasury spokesman. In a press conference about the lawmakers’ brief, Frank said the decision is an invitation “to engage in riskier behavior” and that it imposes “some obstacles to us trying to protect society.” In the brief the lawmakers also said FSOC does not have to find a company is financially vulnerable before it makes a designation.  “Seemingly healthy institutions can defy widely held expert forecasts, collapse quickly and then threaten economic damage on a catastrophic scale,” they wrote, adding Dodd-Frank does not require cost-benefit analyses. American International Group (AIG.N), Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU.N) and General Electric Co’s (GE.N) are also labeled systemically important.

393,MET,"Dodd, Frank blast ruling that MetLife not too big to fail","June 23 (Reuters) - A federal court’s striking down of the government’s designation of insurer MetLife Inc as “too-big-to-fail” could undermine efforts to head off another financial crisis, authors of the landmark Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law said. In a brief filed on Thursday with a federal appeals court, former Senator Chris Dodd, former Representative Barney Frank and other Democratic party leaders said the designation was necessary to bring a key nonbank financial institution under an effective regulatory regime. Signed by 20 current and former lawmakers, the brief opposes U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer’s order in March, now under appeal, rescinding the government’s 2014 designation of MetLife as a systematically important financial institution. Such a designation would reflect regulators’ concern that its failure could hurt the U.S. financial system. Collyer said the designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a group of federal regulatory heads, had been “arbitrary and capricious.” She said the council never adequately assessed the risk of Metlife’s failure and neglected to perform a cost-benefit analysis of applying the designation. The court’s decision “is an invitation to nonbanks to engage in riskier behavior than they have been doing without sufficient regulation,” former Representative Frank said in a press conference about the brief on Thursday. The designation would put MetLife under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which typically regulates banks. “Essentially what the judge did was amend the statute by imposing some obstacles to us trying to protect society,” Frank  said. The FSOC was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and charged with designating systemically important companies, which would be subject to increased regulation and possibly tighter capital requirements. Other companies so designated are insurers American International Group and Prudential Financial Inc. and General Electric Co’s finance arm. In the brief on Thursday, lawmakers said FSOC does not have to find that a company is financially vulnerable before it makes a systemically important designation. “Seemingly healthy institutions can defy widely held expert forecasts, collapse quickly and then threaten economic damage on a catastrophic scale,” the brief said. Dodd-Frank also does not require a cost-benefit analysis because Congress realized that would hamstring the FSOC’s mission, they said. They said Collyer’s decision, if upheld, would hamstring the government’s attempts to prevent another “calamitous financial meltdown.” MetLife spokesman Christopher Stern said the insurer will respond to the court in its own brief in August.

397,MET,MetLife profit falls short of estimates on weaker underwriting,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N), the largest U.S. life insurer, reported a quarterly profit that widely missed analysts’ estimates, largely due to weaker underwriting and tax-related adjustment in two of its largest markets. The company’s shares were down 3.9 percent at $42 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. While weaker underwriting weighed on operating earnings from the Americas, the company’s decision to reduce sale of yen-denominated products and tax-related adjustments hit earnings from Japan. MetLife’s Americas business, which consists of its retail and Latin America units, is the company’s biggest, followed by its Asia business that includes Japan. The company, which plans to separate a substantial portion of its U.S. Retail business, said a review of its variable annuity business during the latest quarter led to a non-cash charge of about $2 billion. MetLife’s Chief Executive Steve Kandarian said in January the company is considering splitting off its U.S. retail business, blaming the regulatory environment.

401,MET,State insurance regulators say U.S. government ignored them in MetLife case,"WASHINGTON(Reuters) - State insurance regulators in a court brief on Monday said a powerful U.S. council made up of the heads of all the federal financial regulatory agencies disregarded their work when it designated of MetLife Inc.  as “too big to fail.” MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, sued the federal government last year after the Financial Stability Oversight Council designated it a systemically important financial institution. That label can lead to additional regulation and capital requirements. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer decided in March to rescind the designation and the U.S. government is currently appealing her decision. In the brief supporting MetLife, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said the council appeared to ignore or discount the state regulatory system, state regulators’ opinions, and the council’s insurance expert “in favor of speculation, assumptions about consumer and regulatory responses to distress that have no basis in fact or history, and a flawed analysis of the insurance business and its regulation.” Unlike many other financial products, insurance is regulated at the state level. When Congress established the FSOC in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law in order to ward off another major financial crisis, it gave a seat to an insurance expert. That expert, Roy Woodall, voted against designating MetLife as systemically important. NAIC said MetLife’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and states can review many of its holding company transactions. It also said that due to the nature of insurance contracts, the company will probably not experience a “run on the bank.” “MetLife is a highly regulated company and the existing regulation has served the company and its policyholders well,” the commissioners said.

In the brief supporting MetLife, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said the council appeared to ignore or discount the state regulatory system, state regulators’ opinions, and the council’s insurance expert “in favor of speculation, assumptions about consumer and regulatory responses to distress that have no basis in fact or history, and a flawed analysis of the insurance business and its regulation.” Unlike many other financial products, insurance is regulated at the state level. When Congress established the FSOC in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law in order to ward off another major financial crisis, it gave a seat to an insurance expert. That expert, Roy Woodall, voted against designating MetLife as systemically important. NAIC said MetLife’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and states can review many of its holding company transactions. It also said that due to the nature of insurance contracts, the company will probably not experience a “run on the bank.” “MetLife is a highly regulated company and the existing regulation has served the company and its policyholders well,” the commissioners said. Only four non-banks have been designated systemically important. Two others, American International Group (AIG.N) and Prudential Financial, Inc. (AIG.N), are also insurers.  The American Council of Life Insurers, which represents the country’s major insurance companies, including MetLife, said in a separate brief also filed on Monday that the council was wrong in treating insurers in a similar manner as banks.  It said policyholders do not use life insurance for liquidity and the gradual maturity of companies’ contracts means they do not have to have “fire sales” of assets to pay policies. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Washington Legal Foundation and the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, along with a panel of eight academic experts, also filed briefs supporting MetLife.

404,MET,Nassib throw winning TD pass for Giants against Jets,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Quarterback Ryan Nassib connected with wide receiver Tavarres King on two touchdown passes, including the 11-yard game-winner to give the New York Giants a 21-20 victory over the New York Jets on Saturday in the annual MetLife Bowl at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. The Giants’ winning score was set up by undrafted rookie safety Andrew Adams, who picked off Jets rookie quarterback Christian Hackenberg (6 of 15 for 105 yards) deep in his own territory to set up King’s second score of the night. Until that throw, Hackenberg, playing his first live snaps this preseason, engineered two scoring drives for 10 points to put the Jets ahead 20-14 his lone touchdown pass being a 10-yarder to wide receiver Robby Anderson. Jets kicker Ross Martin added two field goals, including a 29-yarder to cap Hackenberg’s second scoring drive, and a 55-yard field goal earlier in the game that gave the Jets a 10-0 lead at the time. Jets starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, 9 of 16 for 76 yards, connected with receiver Eric Decker on a 22-yard touchdown pass to put the Jets on the scoreboard first. Fitzpatrick was relieved by Geno Smith, who finished 3 of 5 for 14 yards, followed by Bryce Petty, who went 5 of 10 for 50 yards and whose interception thrown to Giants defensive end Kerry Wynn was returned 73 yards to give the Giants a 14-10 lead in the fourth quarter. The Giants, whose starting offense under quarterback Eli Manning (10 of 15 for 65 yards) not only failed to get on the scoreboard but also failed to get into Jets territory, finally managed to break their scoreless streak when Nassib, who has also had a rough summer, connected with King on the first of their two scores for the night, a 27-yard skinny post that made it 10-7 in the third quarter. The Giants and Jets battled to a scoreless first quarter, though there were some mid-quarter fireworks when Giants punter Brad Wing’s first punt of the game was blocked by Bruce Carter, who blew past Orleans Darkwa of the Giants. The Jets recovered the ball at the Giants 15, but three plays later, former Jets nose tackle Damon Harrison sacked Fitzpatrick for a 9-yard loss, stripping the ball loose for teammate Johnathan Hankins to recover. The forced fumble and recovery by the Giants’ starting defense was their second in as many weeks inside the red zone. However, it was all for naught as the Giants’ starting offense failed to cross into Jets territory in seven offensive possessions. The Giants’ rushing game managed just 5 rushing yards on 12 carries in the first half, their offensive line unable to move a stout Jets defensive front off the ball. The passing game wasn’t much better. Manning’s offensive line couldn’t protect him, with the veteran quarterback being bounced around like a pinball for the majority of the night. The final straw for the first-team Giants offense came when a second-quarter pass intended for wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was picked off by Jets cornerback Darelle Revis to give Gang Green a first-and-10 on the Giants’ 30. On the play, which would go on to set up the Jets’ first score of the game, it looked like Beckham cut short the route in order to avoid a big hit from Jets safety Calvin Pryor. Giants receiver Victor Cruz, making his first appearance in live action since suffering a torn patellar tendon in a regular-season game on October 12, 2014, was targeted twice in about 30 snaps, most of which were spent in his familiar slot position. Cruz had one reception for 4 yards in what was otherwise a very quiet night for his long awaited return. Running back Matt Forte made his Jets debut this week, rushing 10 times for 28 yards and adding two receptions for 9 yards on what was a successful first outing. Forte had been sidelined this summer with a hamstring injury. Also of note for the Jets was the absence of receiver Brandon Marshall, a surprise healthy scratch by coach Todd Bowles, who gave Marshall the night off ahead of the start of the regular season. As they usually seem to do in the preseason against the Jets, the Giants came out with a few injuries. Slot cornerback Leon Hall and rookie linebacker B.J. Goodson both suffered concussions. Starting weak-side linebacker Jonathan Casillas suffered a rib injury on the first defensive series, and fullback Nikita Whitlock was carted off the field in the third quarter with a foot injury. For the Jets, linebacker David Harris suffered a shoulder injury late in the second quarter and did not return to the game.

405,MET,"Fitch Affirms MetLife, Inc. and Most Subsidiaries","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the existing ratings  and Stable Outlook assigned to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife). At the same time, Fitch  has placed the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating of New England Life  Insurance Company (NELIC) on Rating Watch Negative, and affirmed and removed  from Rating Watch Negative the IFS rating of General American Life Insurance  Company (GALIC). The Outlook is now Stable. MetLife Insurance Company USA's IFS   (MetLife USA) remains on Rating Watch Negative. A full list of rating actions is  shown at the end of this release. Today's rating actions follow Fitch's review of MetLife's operating performance  through first- half 2016 (1H16) and reflect ongoing developments around the  company's pending separation of a large portion of its U.S. Retail segment. In  connection with the separation, it is expected that NELIC and MetLife USA will  be the rated entities separated from MetLife and included in the new stand-alone  organization, which has been named Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse  Financial). When the separation was originally announced, GALIC was expected to  join MetLife USA within Brighthouse Financial. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of MetLife's ratings reflects Fitch's view that the company's  strong balance sheet fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very  strong market positions in several major insurance product lines and markets in  the U.S. and select international markets remain consistent with rating  expectations. Fitch believes that the company's large scale and very strong  brand name will continue to provide the company with significant competitive  advantages. Fitch views the pending separation of the Brighthouse  Financial-related businesses as neutral to MetLife's ratings based on our view  that any decline in diversification of MetLife as a result of the separation  will largely be mitigated by the lower risk profile of the businesses remaining  within MetLife.  The ratings also consider MetLife's above-average investment risk, lower  operating profitability in recent quarters and continued macroeconomic  challenges associated with the ongoing low interest rate environment. Fitch  views the uncertainty around MetLife's ultimate status relative to a potential  non-bank systemically important financial institution (SIFI) designation to be  credit neutral.  The Rating Watch Negative status of the entities that are expected to be  separated reflects Fitch's view that the operating risk profile of Brighthouse  Financial is more exposed to capital market volatility and interest rate risk  due to its business concentration in variable annuity and universal life with  secondary guarantee businesses.  Existing ratings assigned to MetLife USA and NELIC benefit from the broad  diversification and scale of the MetLife enterprise, which includes very strong  competitive positions in group, voluntary and worksite; corporate benefit  funding; and international insurance. Accordingly, it is likely that the  ultimate ratings of the separated entities will be lower than the current  ratings by one or two notches depending on whether or not the higher operating  risk profile is sufficiently mitigated via extremely strong capitalization or  other methods for which details are not yet available. Fitch expects to resolve  the Rating Watch status of these entities upon finalization of the form of  separation and further solidification of the capitalization and structure of  Brighthouse Financial. MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's solid  risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch considers  the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations  to be strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's domestic life  insurance subsidiaries (excluding American Life Insurance Company) reported  combined statutory total adjusted capital of approximately $26.8 billion at  year-end 2015, which resulted in consolidated risk-based capital (RBC) of 505%.  Although the company does not provide intra-year RBC estimates, the company's  domestic life insurance subsidiaries reported combined statutory net operating  gain of approximately $1.3 billion in 1H16 and an increase of approximately $1.9  billion in total adjusted capital.  MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest  insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory  solvency margin ratio of 870% at the end of first quarter 2016, which is above  both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers. The company's financial leverage was slightly below 25% at June 30, 2016, down  from approximately 27% at yearend 2015, and within Fitch's expectations for the  company's current ratings. Financial leverage benefited from the maturity of  $1.25 billion of senior notes in June 2016. Fitch views MetLife's operating profitability to be fundamentally sound, but  notes ongoing pressure from low interest rates coupled with recent less  favorable underwriting results. Reported operating income for first half 2016  was significantly affected by the outcome of the company's variable annuity  actuarial assumption review, which was accelerated into the second quarter in  2016 from the typical third quarter timing in preparation for the pending  separation of the Brighthouse Financial businesses. Second quarter operating  earnings were also adversely affected by reserve increases driven by modeling  improvements. DAC unlocking associated with the VA actuarial assumption review  reduced reported operating earnings by $161 million, and the modeling  improvements reduced reported operating earnings by $257 million. Fitch considers MetLife's GAAP interest coverage to be somewhat below  expectations for its current rating category, reflecting lower earnings pressure  noted above. Fitch expects MetLife's GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio to recover  somewhat from the 5.5x level achieved in 1H16 to a level between 7.0x and 7.5x for full-year 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES For two subsidiaries on Rating Watch Negative: Fitch may downgrade ratings upon application of criteria for non-core entities  as mentioned above or upon further announcements by the company of strategic  plans. For MetLife and remaining subsidiaries:  Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, run-rate  ROE below 10%, and GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x.

411,MET,"U.S. government, MetLife set for rematch over 'too big to fail'","WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. government and the country’s largest life insurer are set for a rematch in a U.S. appeals court on Monday over how federal regulators decide a company is “too big to fail,” one of the most significant reforms to come out of the financial crisis. The heart of the fight is whether the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators, should have designated MetLife Inc. a “systemically important financial institution.” The label indicates MetLife’s collapse could devastate the financial system, and it triggers tighter oversight. MetLife would also have to set aside capital to ensure it would not need a government bailout during a crisis. In March, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer struck down the designation, saying the council used an “arbitrary and capricious” process in assessing MetLife’s vulnerabilities. She also said the government should have analyzed costs and benefits to MetLife, the likelihood it would fail and possible counterparty losses. Most of the arguments before the three judges on Monday’s appeals panel will revolve around the steps the FSOC took, with the U.S. government saying Collyer’s requirements are not found in any laws and the government cannot assess the likelihood of a company’s failure or counterparty losses. MetLife was designated “too big to fail” in 2014. It says the FSOC decided first that it was “too big to fail” and then created a justification for the label. MetLife will also argue the FSOC should have followed an alternative process known as the activities-based approach, that it says is less costly and better suited to insurance. In that approach, the FSOC would decide a certain activity poses a risk and then regulate it across all companies. The FSOC has said it does not have authority to designate an activity under statute. In April, however, it announced it would use the activities-based method to assess risk in asset managers and mutual funds, leaving MetLife to call its fairness into question. Collyer’s decision was considered a blow to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, one of the most important pieces of legislation passed during President Barack Obama’s tenure, and which has been under attack from Republicans in Congress. The law authorized the council to designate nonbank companies in response to the $182 billion government bailout that insurer American International Group received during the 2008 financial crisis. AIG and Prudential Insurance  are also labeled systemically important. Two of the judges hearing Monday’s arguments, Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett, were appointed by Obama and the third, A. Raymond Randolph, by former President George H. W. Bush, a Republican. A decision could come before next year. The losing side may ask the full court for a review or may appeal to the Supreme Court. Many familiar names from the crisis filed briefs supporting the government’s appeal of Collyer’s decision, including former Senator Chris Dodd, former Representative Barney Frank and former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke.

Many familiar names from the crisis filed briefs supporting the government’s appeal of Collyer’s decision, including former Senator Chris Dodd, former Representative Barney Frank and former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, made up of the industry’s state regulators, supports MetLife. The company says it recently decided to break up its business in response to the regulatory environment.

421,MET,MetLife expects $300 million boost to operating profit from interest rates,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) expects higher U.S. interest rates to add $300 million to operating profits through 2019, the insurer said in a filing on Thursday. The New York-based company, which provides life insurance, annuities and employee benefits, detailed anticipated benefits from higher U.S. interest rates in an 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. At the same time, MetLife said it would face challenges in some foreign businesses and expenses for a cost-cutting program. MetLife forecast an earnings bump of $45 million next year, followed by $105 million in 2018 and $150 million in 2019, because of interest rate hikes. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates a quarter point on Wednesday and signaled a faster pace of increases in 2017 as the Trump administration takes over with promises to boost growth through tax cuts, spending and deregulation. Additionally, MetLife disclosed it would incur $300 million in pretax expenses in 2017 for a cost-cutting program announced earlier this year. The company’s baseline operating earnings in its Latin American business would be about 10 percent lower in 2017, mostly due to Mexico’s declining peso, MetLife said. Uncertainty about potential changes to MetLife’s pension business in Chile could adversely impact operating earnings in Latin America by up to 5 percent, the company said.

422,MET,"CORRECTED-Florida lets MetLife, Unum boost premiums for long-term care","(Corrects 10 years to seven years in third paragraph) By Suzanne Barlyn Jan 12 (Reuters) - Florida’s insurance commissioner is allowing MetLife Inc and Unum Group to boost long-term care premiums, alleviating some financial stress the insurers have been facing from rising medical costs and policyholders living longer. MetLife’s Florida subdivisions can increase average monthly premiums by $4 to $44 over the next three years, while two Unum units can raise them by $5 to $55, Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier said on Thursday. Increases will be phased in during an initial three-year period, beginning this year. Rates will then be guaranteed for an additional seven years with no further increases, Altmaier’s office said. The agreements come at a difficult time for the long-term care insurance industry. Insurers must make good on policies written during the 1990s and later, when they significantly underestimated projected health-care costs and life spans. “MetLife determined that a rate change on certain long term care insurance policies was necessary due to cumulative changes in actuarial assumptions since the time these policies were initially priced,” MetLife spokeswoman Kim Friedman said. An Unum spokeswoman declined to comment. Insurers have been pushing for U.S. state insurance regulators to grant rate increases for long-term care policies. Last April, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department approved rate increases of between 20 and 30 percent for a total of 46,525 policies in the state. Long-term care insurance covers expenses for nursing home or home care if the policyholder becomes incapacitated. Most of those expenses are not covered by Medicare, the U.S. government insurance program for the elderly and disabled, and can be extremely expensive out of pocket. The median annual cost of a private U.S. nursing home room last year was $92,376, according to Genworth Financial Inc . People over age 60 make up nearly 23 percent of Florida’s 19 million residents, according to the Areawide Council on Aging of Broward County Inc. Still, the impact of Florida increase and long-term care market overall is small for MetLife, given the company’s diversified business lines, said Sandler O’Neill analyst John Barnidge. Unum may feel the impact slightly more, given its position as a leading provider of disability insurance products, Barnidge said. But Unum, which stopped offering new long-term care policies in 2012, does not have a large business in that market, Barnidge said.

430,MET,UPDATE 1-U.S. financial regulators discuss firm's 'too big to fail' label,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of all major U.S. financial regulators, met late on Thursday afternoon and reviewed its designation of a nonbank firm as “too big to fail,” according to a statement from the Treasury Department. While the statement did not name the firm, only three nonbank companies have been labeled “systemically important financial institutions,” (SIFIs) a designation that triggers tougher oversight and requires firms to hold more capital. According to a source familiar with the meeting, the council discussed rescinding the firm’s designation, but no decision has been made.  The council analyzes its designations each year to see if they are still relevant, but the Thursday discussion stood out because it was the first meeting chaired by newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  During his confirmation hearing, Mnuchin said he would like to review the council’s work. President Donald Trump has said he wants to cut a lot out of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the council and the designations. “The council discussed the ongoing annual reevaluation of its designation of a nonbank financial company, including the review of materials submitted by the company and engagement with the company,” according to the statement. One of the three, insurer American International Group, received a $182 billion government bailout during the 2007-09 financial crisis, which led lawmakers to include the “too big to fail” label for nonbanks in Dodd-Frank. The others are Prudential Financial and MetLife Inc.. A judge last year struck down the designation of MetLife, and the government is appealing the ruling. Until the appeal is decided MetLife is not considered systemically important. Of late, AIG has been selling assets and reducing its size, raising the possibility it will follow in the footsteps of General Electric Co, which last year persuaded the council to remove its systemically important label by shedding its capital unit and many of its ties to the financial system. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, currently advising Trump on federal regulation, had pressed AIG to become a leaner company in order to lose the SIFI designation. After Trump’s surprise election win in November, Icahn said AIG was still undervalued, but doing better after the asset sales. He also said some Dodd-Frank measures went too far.  AIG last week said in an annual filing that the label creates  “considerable uncertainty” for insurers.

433,MET,MetLife asks court to halt 'too big to fail' case during Trump review,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) is asking a U.S. court to put on pause a case over how the government deems certain companies “too big to fail,” one of the most significant reforms to come out of the financial crisis, while President Donald Trump’s administration finishes reviewing the current regulatory approach. In March 2016 U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer struck down the government’s designation of MetLife as “systemically important,” saying it was “arbitrary and capricious” in assessing the risks to the financial system of a possible failure by the largest U.S. life insurer. The government, under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, immediately appealed and the two sides squared off in court last October, with a decision expected next month. Some companies are wary of the “too big to fail” designation because it forces them to hold on to capital and creates extra oversight they say is burdensome. Last week, Trump ordered a review of the Financial Stability Oversight Council made up of the country’s top financial regulators and how it makes the designations. MetLife said in its filing the review could prompt the Trump administration to reconsider the case and whether “it is appropriate for the government to continue pressing this appeal.” “At a minimum, the findings of the forthcoming report may substantially illuminate this court’s consideration of the issues on appeal,” the company wrote. Two of the three judges on the panel considering the case were appointed by Obama, who signed the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created designations with the intent of preventing a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when the government injected billions of dollars into failing banks and other companies in order to keep the financial system afloat. The court appeared more sympathetic to FSOC’s arguments than Collyer, who said it should have analyzed costs and benefits to MetLife, the likelihood MetLife would fail and possible counterparty losses.  Whoever loses the appeal had been expected to take the case to the Supreme Court. However, Trump’s review and MetLife’s Monday motion now cast doubt on that possibility. The U.S. Treasury did not respond to a request for comment. Its secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is overseeing the review as chair of the FSOC. The only nonbanks carrying the “too big to fail” label are American International Group (AIG.N), which received a $182 billion bailout during the crisis, and Prudential Insurance (PRU.N). MetLife is not considered designated during the appeal. ",4242017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-metlife-trump/metlife-asks-court-to-halt-too-big-to-fail-case-during-trump-review-idUSKBN17Q27M

435,MET,MetLife to invest $1 billion in tech to reach cost-savings goals,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) plans to invest $1 billion in an efficiency program through 2019 that will eventually reduce annual operating costs by around $800 million, the insurer said on Thursday. The investments will go toward technology improvements, Chief Executive Steven Kandarian wrote in his annual letter to shareholders, but did not provide more details. MetLife first unveiled its cost-cutting plan last summer, saying it would save a gross $1 billion a year, partly through job cuts. In Kandarian’s letter and a separate proxy filing, the insurer said pretax annual savings would be $800 million when netting out “stranded” overhead costs related to a business it is divesting. In February, MetLife’s board conducted a “deep dive examination” of the insurer’s strategy and goals to boost shareholder returns, Kandarian said. A key part of that strategy is the planned spinoff of Brighthouse Financial, its retail life insurance business, which is awaiting regulatory approval. The company continues to look for ways to reduce the capital it needs to hold and increase its free cash flow, Kandarian said. In his letter, the CEO touched on everything from U.S. tax reform and expectations of an easing regulatory environment to the company’s plan to return nearly $4.5 billion of capital to shareholders this year. “The U.S. federal regulatory outlook is now more positive than it has been in nearly a decade,” Kandarian said, adding that the “prospect for pro-growth tax reform has also brightened.” The remarks come days after the White House unveiled a proposal to significantly cut corporate taxes, and MetLife asked an appeals court to pause a case regarding whether it deserved a “too big to fail” designation while the Trump administration finishes reviewing the current regulatory approach.

Operating costs were little changed at $14.91 billion. MetLife aims to save a gross $1 billion a year, through its cost-cutting plan, which also includes job cuts. The company, which has been streamlining its businesses in response to a strict regulatory environment, plans to spin off its U.S. retail business, Brighthouse Financial, this year. The company’s net profit fell to $820 million, or 75 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $2.20 billion, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier. The insurer recorded $602 million in net derivative losses in the quarter, reflecting changes in equity markets and interest rates. MetLife had recorded derivative gains of $868 million in the prior-year quarter. The insurer uses its derivatives program to hedge against risks such as volatile currency exchange rates, equities markets and interest rate changes.

443,MET,"U.S. government says it needs more time in MetLife 'too-big-to-fail"" case","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday requested a 60-day pause in a case involving MetLife Inc (MET.N), the country’s largest life insurer, and how regulators designate certain companies as “too big to fail,” a major reform arising from the 2007-09 financial crisis. MetLife had asked for a delay in the case last month, saying the court should wait until President Donald Trump’s administration finishes its financial regulation review. The Republican president has ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to look into the designations and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that established how to identify “systemically important” firms so big they could devastate the financial system if they failed. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by Mnuchin, said in a court filing it did not take a position on waiting until Treasury reports the review’s findings. It said, however, that council members, including Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and new Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton, needed “additional time for deliberation.” The council will delve into the designation process and Trump’s review at a meeting next Monday, according to a notice from Treasury. In March 2016, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer struck down the FSOC’s designation of MetLife as “systemically important,” saying it was “arbitrary and capricious.”  The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama appealed and the two sides squared off in court last October, with a decision expected this month. Some companies are wary of the “too-big-to-fail” designation because it forces them to hold on to capital and creates extra oversight they say is burdensome. The only two nonbanks now carrying the label are American International Group (AIG.N), which received a $182 billion bailout during the crisis, and Prudential Insurance (PRU.N). MetLife is not considered designated during the appeal. Critics of the designations have said the Trump administration should be able to withdraw the appeal or the court should at least consider the new president’s views and his review’s findings, which are expected to call for changes to designations.

444,MET,MetLife changes hedging strategy after billions in losses,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) has changed its derivatives trading strategy after two consecutive quarters in which losses from wrong-way trades hurt the insurer’s profit. The largest U.S. life insurer has altered the “technique and structure” of certain hedges to make the company less sensitive to interest rate movements, Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian told analysts on a call to discuss first-quarter results on Thursday. Operating profit beat analyst expectations, but included after-tax net losses of $602 million related to its derivatives portfolio in the first quarter. The prior quarter included $3.2 billion worth of such losses. MetLife’s derivatives losses largely pertain to its planned divestiture of a retail insurance business called Brighthouse Financial. Other insurers that reported results recently, including American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N), have not had the same issues. On the call, JPMorgan analyst Jamminder Singh Bhullar said he was “a little surprised” by the losses, considering interest rates did not move in a significant way against the type of positions executives described during the first quarter. Kandarian cited several factors in response: a rising U.S. stock market, a decline in 10-year Treasury note prices, higher rates for hedges, accounting standards that treat MetLife’s positions unfavorably, plus general “ineffectiveness” all hurt the company, he said. The “ineffectiveness” alone cost MetLife $139 million, Chief Financial Officer John Hele said. Two-thirds of the losses were “non-economic,” meaning they reflect accounting standards regarding how assets and liabilities are valued, rather than the underlying health of the business, MetLife said. All major financial companies use a type of derivative known as swaps to offset possible losses from changes in interest rates. However, rates have been at lows for a historic amount of time, as the Federal Reserve and other central banks tried to boost economies following the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed began raising rates last year and hiked its key rate target again in March, hurting companies that expected rates to remain low for longer. Changes in market values can cause large swings in earnings related to derivatives because of the way companies must treat them under accounting rules. MetLife’s painful derivatives positions are largely a result of positions it put in place to ensure Brighthouse would be financially strong from a capital perspective, and the spinoff would go smoothly. The company is awaiting regulatory approvals for the spinoff, which are unlikely to happen within the first half of the year, Kandarian said.

449,MET,U.S. court puts hold on 'too big to fail' case involving MetLife,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday granted a 60-day pause in the long-running case in which the country’s largest life insurer, MetLife Inc, has challenged the federal government’s labeling of it as “too big to fail,” as the Trump administration wrestles with reforms arising from the financial crisis. More than a year ago, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer struck down the government’s designation of MetLife as “systemically important,” which signifies it could devastate the financial system if it failed and triggers stricter oversight, saying the label was “arbitrary and capricious.” The administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, immediately appealed. In October the government and insurance company had a rematch before two judges appointed by Obama, Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett, and one by former President George H.W. Bush, a Republican. At the time most expected a ruling to soon follow, with the losing side possibly appealing to the Supreme Court. Republican President Donald Trump, however, has expressed skepticism about the designation process and the council of regulatory heads that assign the labels, and has ordered the Treasury Department to review both. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also has said the council’s work should be evaluated. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, intended to avoid a repeat of the 2007-09 crisis and recession, created the Financial Stability Oversight Council and empowered it to designate non-banks as systemically important. Last week the council asked the court to put the appeal on hold for 60 days, saying it needed “additional time for deliberation.”  Previously MetLife had asked for a pause until Treasury completed its review. A spokesman for the company said it was pleased with the 60-day abeyance. The company is not officially labeled “too big to fail” during the appeal.

Fitch is especially concerned about the “funding of assets in support the company’s variable annuity business, consolidated financial leverage and the overall levels of statutory capital,” the company said.

Fitch’s rating for Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, a Brighthouse Financial unit, is still strong, but more accurately reflects the insurer’s change in targets, said Fitch analyst Bradley Ellis.  “When we originally assigned the ratings in October, we anticipated more stability in some of these capitalization metrics because of the projections they provided,” Ellis told Reuters. Fitch is especially concerned about the “funding of assets in support the company’s variable annuity business, consolidated financial leverage and the overall levels of statutory capital,” the company said. The ratings firm also wants to see some changes at Brighthouse to reflect its strength as a standalone company, Ellis said. “We’d like to see a track record of more stability,” he said.

463,MET,Fitch Rates Brighthouse Financial's Senior Notes 'BBB(EXP)',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an expected rating of 'BBB(EXP)' to Brighthouse Financial, Inc.'s (Brighthouse) proposed issuance of up to $3 billion new senior unsecured notes. The expected rating reflects standard notching based on Fitch's rating criteria. Fitch expects proceeds from the debt issuance to be used to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) and for general corporate purposes, including potential capital contributions to Brighthouse's life insurance subsidiaries. Fitch also expects that following issuance of the new notes being rated today, Brighthouse's financial leverage will remain significantly below the sensitivity established for the company's ratings on May 31, 2017. The expected rating also relies heavily on a guarantee from MetLife, under which MetLife will fully and unconditionally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, the full and prompt payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes. The MetLife guarantee will terminate and be automatically and unconditionally released upon a distribution of Brighthouse common stock to MetLife's shareholders. KEY RATING DRIVERS Brighthouse's ratings continue to reflect the company's very strong statutory capitalization, significant operating scale, and strong risk-management capabilities. The business that will be contained within Brighthouse represents approximately 25% of MetLife's current total assets, which places Brighthouse as a top-12 U.S. life insurer on a standalone basis. The ratings also consider the company's above-average exposure to market-sensitive variable annuity and universal life with secondary guarantee businesses, which could have a negative impact on risk-based capitalization and earnings in an adverse market scenario. Fitch believes that further seasoning as a stand-alone company while maintaining a strong capitalization profile would ultimately reflect positively on the company's credit profile. RATING SENSITIVITIES The expected rating Fitch has assigned to Brighthouse's senior unsecured notes relies heavily on MetLife's full and unconditional guarantee on a senior unsecured basis, the full and prompt payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes until the contribution of Brighthouse Holdings, LLC, Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, and New England Life Insurance Company (NELICO) to Brighthouse is complete. The ratings also assume a generally uneventful execution of Brighthouse's legal separation from MetLife. Significant adverse developments related to the separation could have negative implications for the ratings. In the near term, a significant decline in management's strategic target for statutory capital backing the variable annuity business at separation could lead to a downgrade. Longer-term, Fitch will apply its Prism capital model to Brighthouse when sufficient information becomes available, which is likely to be in 2017. A Prism capital score below 'Strong' could cause Fitch to reassess its view of Brighthouse's capital strength, which supports the rating. Additional downgrade sensitivities include a financial leverage ratio exceeding 28%, or a significant deterioration in profitability. The primary upgrade sensitivity would include establishment of a track record of strong operating performance, risk management and reasonable stability in capitalization following the company's separation from MetLife.

464,MET,Metlife adds to CEO succession pool with new appointments,"June 15 (Reuters) - Metlife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, announced added responsibilities for some of its senior executives, adding to the pool of potential successors to its chief executive. The largest U.S. life insurer named Michel Khalaf president of its U.S. business, effective July 1, to replace Maria Morris who retires from the company this fall. Marty Lippert, the company’s head of global technology and operations will take on added responsibility of MetLife Holdings, the company said. The appointments of Khalaf and Lippert set up a “horse race” for MetLife’s CEO position, held by Steven Kandarian, 65, who currently has no plans to retire from his role, an analyst with Wells Fargo said in a note. Other potential candidates for the top job include Chief Financial Officer John Hele, Chief Investment Officer Steven Goulart, and Asia head Christopher Townsend, the note said. In June last year, Metlife’s board agreed to waive off its 65-year retirement policy for Kandarian, who has been the company’s president and CEO since May 2011. Ramy Tadros will also join MetLife in September as the new chief risk officer, the company said. Tadros comes from Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, where he served as the global head of insurance. He will replace Stan Talbi, who will retire at the end of August after 43 years with MetLife.

472,MET,MetLife seeks new delay in 'too big to fail' case to wait for Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) on Thursday asked for another delay in the long-running case over whether the U.S. government should have labeled it as “too big to fail,” warning that the Trump administration may want to withdraw the government’s appeal.   A U.S. Appeals court in May granted a 60-day abeyance in the appeal filed by the administration of Democratic former President Barack Obama. The pause ends next week. Last year a U.S. district judge invalidated the government’s designation of MetLife as “systemically important,” a label signifying MetLife could devastate the financial system if it failed and triggering stricter oversight. The Obama administration immediately appealed, and a panel of three judges heard arguments in the case last October. Republican President Donald Trump, however, has expressed skepticism about designations and the council of regulatory heads that assigns the labels. Both were created through the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  Given the Trump administration’s drive to strip down regulation and its criticism of Dodd-Frank, many expect it to change the government’s stance in the appeal. MetLife, in its filing, said the court should wait to rule until the administration finishes its review of designations, expected in October. “Because the forthcoming report will reflect the new administration’s assessment of agency procedures that are at the very heart of this appeal, the report may prompt the government to change its positions on one or more issues in this appeal or to abandon the appeal altogether,” wrote attorney Eugene Scalia, representing the company, the largest U.S. life insurer. “At a minimum, the report may materially inform this court’s consideration of the issues on appeal.” Since his January inauguration, Trump has rolled back  regulation, creating major waves in the legal system.  In its filing, MetLife cited four cases involving the Environmental Protection Agency that were put on pause while the administration reviews related regulations. The Labor Department sought to delay a case involving a new retirement-advice rule, which a judge denied, and the Education Department recently suspended a student-loan rule partly because of a pending lawsuit. MetLife was designated in 2014 but is not considered systemically important during the appeal.  Dodd-Frank established labeling nonbank companies as “too big to fail” in response to the $182 billion government bailout that insurer American International Group (AIG.N) received during the 2008 financial crisis. AIG and Prudential Insurance (PRU.N) are also labeled systemically important.

474,MET,MetLife says to buy bond fund manager Logan Circle for $250 million,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) has agreed to buy bond fund manager Logan Circle Partners from Fortress Investment Group LLC FIG.N for $250 million, a statement from the insurer said on Friday. The transaction, due to close in the third quarter, will be funded with cash and will not affect MetLife’s $3 billion share buyback program, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. By adding Logan Circle’s $33.7 billion of assets under management, MetLife is boosting its investment management business at a time when U.S. insurers are placing increased emphasis on such revenue streams after contending with years of low interest rates and regulatory challenges. The upcoming spinoff of its retail life insurance business, Brighthouse Financial Inc, has been part of that strategy. The Logan Circle deal would allow MetLife to earn more recurring cash flow and revenue from activities which do not tie up as much of the insurer’s capital, Chief Investment Officer Steven Goulart said in an interview. Goulart noted its strategy foresaw MetLife as an institutional, fixed-income asset manager, with Logan Circle jump-starting the public fixed-income aspect of this. He declined to provide any forecasts on how Logan Circle would affect MetLife’s revenue. While he expected most future growth in this part of the business to come organically, MetLife was open to potential further acquisitions if the right asset came along, he added. Reuters reported in April that Fortress, which is being acquired by Japan’s SoftBank Group (9984.T) for $3.3 billion, was seeking to divest Logan Circle. Founded by Chief Executive Jude Driscoll in 2007 as a joint venture between management and Guggenheim Partners LLC, Logan Circle was bought by Fortress in 2010 for an initial $21 million.

477,MET,U.S. financial regulators to discuss MetLife lawsuit next week,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Heads of the U.S. financial regulatory agencies will meet behind closed doors next Friday to discuss MetLife Inc’s (MET.N) lawsuit against them, according to a notice from Treasury, as the Trump administration wrestles with reforms put in place in response to the financial crisis. The regulators, who comprise the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), and MetLife both asked earlier this month for another pause in the long-running case in which the country’s largest life insurer has challenged the federal government’s decision to label it as “too big to fail.” The appeals court has not yet said whether it will grant an abeyance. More than a year ago, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer struck down the council’s designation of MetLife as “systemically important,” which signifies that it could devastate the financial system if it failed and which triggers stricter oversight. Collyer said the label was “arbitrary and capricious.” The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama immediately appealed. Republican President Donald Trump, however, has expressed skepticism about the designation process, and the FSOC has ordered the Treasury Department to review both. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who chairs the council, also has said its work should be evaluated. Both sides of the lawsuit have said the appeals court should put the case on pause until Mnuchin finishes his review. In May, the court granted a 60-day abeyance, which expired this month. Only two other insurers - Prudential Insurance (PRU.N) and American International Group (AIG.N) - still carry the “systemically important” label. According to the Treasury notice, the council will also receive an update on the designation of one of the insurance companies and discuss Mnuchin’s recent recommendations to change a rule on proprietary trading, commonly called the Volcker Rule, in next week’s executive session. In a June report Mnuchin suggested easing up on the Volcker rule, which restricts banks’ ability to place speculative market bets. On Friday, banking regulators said they would review how the rule is being carried out to ensure that foreign funds are properly exempted.

481,MET,U.S. regulators weigh future of appeal in MetLife case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. financial regulators ventured into uncharted legal territory on Friday, as they weighed the future of their appeal in a long-running case over their labeling of MetLife Inc (MET.N) as “too big to fail.” Almost everyone expected Republican President Donald Trump to withdraw the appeal, filed by the Obama administration, soon after taking office, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served as chief economist for former President George W. Bush. Withdrawal would let stand a judge’s 2016 decision that MetLife, the country’s largest life insurer, should not be designated a “systemically important financial institution,” a relatively new label that triggers heightened oversight and capital requirements. Instead, both MetLife and the U.S. government have repeatedly asked for delays in the case since Trump’s inauguration. MetLife is currently considered “dedesignated.” On Friday the Financial Stability Oversight Council(FSOC) that makes the designations, consisting of the Treasury Secretary, Federal Reserve Chair and other regulatory chiefs, met to discuss the case. Because FSOC is a new body, no one is sure of the next legal step. The council did not make any announcement after the meeting. Critics of designation, including Holtz-Eakin, say that since the Obama administration asked the Justice Department to file the appeal and represent the FSOC, the Justice Department can simply withdraw the appeal. Trump has ordered U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to review FSOC and the designation process, after expressing skepticism of both. “We believe the Trump administration should support an abeyance in the case until the review of the FSOC designation process is complete, which could lead to the dismissal of the appeal,” said MetLife in a statement to Reuters. Withdrawing the appeal could ease the way for the “systemically important” non-banks - American International Group (AIG.N) and Prudential Insurance (PRU.N) - to also shed the label.  Supporters of the Dodd-Frank regulatory reforms that came out of the 2007-2009 financial crisis want the appeal to proceed.  Non-profit lobby group, Better Markets, Inc. that pushes for a strict interpretation of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, recently asked the court to appoint independent counsel for FSOC, saying the Justice Department cannot represent both the council and the Trump administration. It also believes that FSOC, in removing designations, should follow steps similar to those for making a designation, namely an extensive review, said Dennis Kelleher, Better Markets president. “FSOC is created by statute and it has duties and obligations under its statute,” he said. “It should not and cannot abdicate its duties to a single district judge.” (This version of the story corrects headline to show the appeal is the government’s, not MetLife’s, and clarifies that they are not weighing whether to appeal) ",7282017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-metlife/u-s-regulators-weigh-future-of-appeal-in-metlife-case-idUSKBN1AD2PM

484,MET,U.S. judges allow public to see records in MetLife 'too big to fail' case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The public may soon be able to delve into how a U.S. District Court judge came to rule that MetLife Inc (MET.N) is not “too big to fail,” after three appeals judges on Tuesday decided many records in the case should be unsealed. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer last year rescinded financial regulators’ designation of MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, as “systemically important,” a label triggering heightened oversight and requirements to hold additional capital. When advocacy group Better Markets then asked Collyer to unseal the case’s records, she decided that under a confidentiality provision in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law they had to remain under wraps.  Better Markets appealed that decision while former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, appealed Collyer’s recission. Both appeals were argued at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The three-judge panels hearing the appeals share one member, Judge Sri Srinivasan, an Obama appointee. Tuesday’s opinion in the Better Markets appeal was written by Chief Judge Merrick Garland, Obama’s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court who the Republican-led Senate last year refused to consider. It said the public has a longstanding right to see judicial records. “The right of public access is a fundamental element of the rule of law, important to maintaining the integrity and legitimacy of an independent judicial branch,” the opinion said.  In a unanimous vote, the judges remanded the case, ordering the lower court to review each document and provide reasons beyond the Dodd-Frank provision for any it decides should remain sealed. “The decision is a huge victory for the American people and their right to know how our courts and agencies are protecting the public interest,” said Stephen Hall, the Better Markets legal director who had argued the appeal. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which includes the Treasury secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission chair and the Federal Reserve chair, was established within Dodd-Frank in part to identify institutions so large and interconnected they could devastate the financial system if they fail. The council, which now includes many of Republican President Donald Trump’s appointees, is currently considering whether it should withdraw Obama’s appeal.  Many had expected the appeals judges to render a decision soon after hearing arguments in October. But since January, MetLife and FSOC have both asked for abeyances.

487,MET,U.S. court puts MetLife 'too big to fail' case on indefinite pause,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Any legal decision on whether the largest U.S. life insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N) should be labeled “too big to fail” will probably come after the Trump administration defines its stance on the designation. A U.S. appeals court said on Wednesday that a U.S. government appeal of a ruling last year that the label was wrongly applied to MetLife would remain in abeyance until further court order. The label indicates companies that are not banks are still so large and interconnected they could damage the financial system if they fail. Both parties are to file motions on the case’s future by Nov. 17 or within 30 days of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin issuing a report on how the government determines non-bank financial institutions are “systemically important.”  The designation, which triggers heightened oversight, is decided by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), made up of the country’s top regulators. “This decision provides the current administration time to determine whether any of FSOC’s positions in this case should be reconsidered and whether it is appropriate for the government to continue pressing this appeal,” said MetLife spokesman Christopher Stern. Both MetLife and the Justice Department, representing FSOC, had requested an abeyance. Last year, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer rescinded the label of MetLife. The administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, then appealed. That left only two companies, American International Group (AIG.N) and Prudential Inc (PRU.N) designated as systemically important. After taking office, President Donald Trump, a Republican, ordered Mnuchin to review the designations. Many expect Trump will use his findings as reasons to withdraw the appeal. There is no clear legal path for him to follow because FSOC and the designations are relatively new, both established in 2010. Since FSOC labeled MetLife with a vote, some posit it should vote on withdrawing the appeal. That could be difficult. Trump appointees such as Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton sit on the council alongside Obama appointees, including Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Others contend Trump or Mnuchin can order the Justice Department to withdraw it.

However, No. 2 U.S. life insurer Prudential Financial (PRU.N) reported a steep drop in quarterly profit as it recorded a $679 million charge.

495,MET,Brighthouse Financial shares slip in market debut,"(Reuters) - Shares of Brighthouse Financial Inc fell as much as 6 percent in its market debut on Monday, as the U.S. retail insurer spun off from MetLife Inc goes solo in an industry that has been hurt by low interest rates. The stock touched a low of $60.58 in early trading, giving it a market capitalization of $7.26 billion. At least five brokerages started coverage of the stock, with the majority having a “market perform” or equivalent rating.  Wells Fargo Securities analyst Sean Dargan said while a stand-alone Brighthouse offers potential upside if markets and interest rates move upward in tandem, he did not view the “risk-reward” favorably at this time. “If interest rates fall from here or equity markets retrace, we would expect BHF to be a heavily shorted name,” said Dargan, who began coverage of the stock with a “market perform” rating  and a $71 price target. Low interest rates have made it difficult for insurers to earn more on their investments as much of their portfolio is made up of low-yielding bonds. Investors can now decide for themselves whether to hold the two companies, which have different risk profiles, MetLife Chief Executive Steven Kandarian said in a CNBC interview on Monday. “If you like the theory of Brighthouse, where interest rates might rise over time, where strong equity markets will be a tailwind … then you would be a candidate to be a long-term holder” of the stock, Kandarian said. MetLife holds a 19.9 percent stake in Brighthouse, which it plans to dispose of “as soon as practicable,” within five years, according to a filing. The completion of the spinoff, a plan unveiled last year, ends MetLife’s reign as the largest U.S. life insurer by assets. That title will now be held by Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential Financial Inc, which had $797.4 billion in assets as of March 31, according to a filing and data from the American Council of Life Insurers. Following the spinoff, MetLife will be left with core businesses centered mainly around group life-insurance and other employee benefits, asset management and a clutch of international operations. “Our goal for post-separation MetLife is to be a company that can perform well in a variety of macroeconomic environments,” Kandarian said in April. A slimmed-down MetLife is likely to help the company in its legal battle against the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council naming it “systemically important” in 2014. The designation - which triggers stricter regulatory oversight as the insurer has the potential to devastate the financial system if it fails - was struck down by a U.S. judge last year.

497,MET,Fitch Assigns 'BBB+' IDR to Brighthouse Financial; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, August 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a Long-Term Issuer Default rating of 'BBB+' to Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse), reflecting completion of the legal transfer of Brighthouse Holdings, LLC and its insurance operating subsidiaries Brighthouse Life Insurance, New England Life Insurance Company (NELICO), and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY from MetLife, Inc. (MetLIfe) to Brighthouse, and completion of the separation of Brighthouse from MetLife, Inc. Fitch previously had an expected rating of 'BBB+(EXP)' on Brighthouse pending the transfer of these assets. Concurrently, Fitch has affirmed the 'A' Insurer Financial Strength ratings of Brighthouse Life and NELICO. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Brighthouse is a holding company that was formed in 2016 to ultimately house a substantial portion of MetLife's former Retail segment, which MetLife announced on Jan. 12, 2016, would likely be separated through public offering of shares in an independent, publicly traded company, a spin-off, or a sale. This separation was completed on Aug. 4, 2017, with MetLife's distribution of 80.8% of Brighthouse's common shares to MetLife common shareholders. KEY RATING DRIVERS Brighthouse's ratings continue to reflect the company's very strong statutory capitalization, significant operating scale, and strong risk-management capabilities. The businesses that makeup Brighthouse represented approximately 25% of MetLife's total assets at year-end 2016, which places Brighthouse as a top-12 U.S. life insurer. The ratings also consider Brighthouse's above-average exposure to market-sensitive variable annuity and universal life with secondary guarantee businesses, which could have a negative impact on risk-based capitalization and earnings in an adverse market scenario. RATING SENSITIVITIES In the near term, a significant decline in management's strategic target for statutory capital backing the variable annuity business at separation could lead to a downgrade. Longer-term, Fitch will apply its Prism capital model to Brighthouse when sufficient information becomes available, which is likely to be in 2018. A Prism capital score below 'Strong' could cause Fitch to reassess its view of Brighthouse's capital strength, which supports the rating. Additional downgrade sensitivities include a financial leverage ratio exceeding 28%, or a significant deterioration in profitability. The primary upgrade sensitivity would include establishment of a track record of strong operating performance, risk management and reasonable stability in capitalization. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following rating: Brighthouse Financial, Inc. --IDR of 'BBB+'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Brighthouse Financial, Inc. --4.70% senior unsecured notes due June 22, 2047 at 'BBB' --3.70% senior unsecured notes due June 22, 2027 at 'BBB'. Brighthouse Holdings, LLC --IDR at 'BBB+'; --6.50% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Units at 'BBB-'. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company New England Life Insurance Company --IFS at 'A'.

Brighthouse’s shares touched a low of $62 in early trading, giving it a market capitalization of $7.43 billion. The completion of the spinoff, a plan unveiled last year, ends MetLife’s reign as the largest U.S. life insurer by assets.

The designation - which triggers stricter regulatory oversight as the insurer has the potential to devastate the financial system if it fails - was struck down by a U.S. judge last year. Last week, a U.S. appeals court said that a U.S. government appeal of a ruling last year that the label was wrongly applied to MetLife would remain in abeyance until further court order. Any legal decision on whether MetLife should be labeled ""too big to fail"" will probably come after the Trump administration defines its stance on the designation.

500,MET,"MetLife seeks changes to protect interest payments, dividends","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) is asking some bond investors and shareholders to approve changes that are necessary for the insurer to make interest payments as usual, and continue returning capital to common shareholders, following its recent Brighthouse Financial Inc (BHF.O) spinoff. In separate notices on Thursday, MetLife asked holders of some $3.2 billion worth of debt to approve changes to “interest payment tests” in bond indentures and called a special meeting of shareholders to approve changes to “dividend payment tests” in the company’s charter. Under current terms, MetLife would be barred from paying dividends on common stock or buying back shares if its equity drops by more than 10 percent and it reports a cumulative net loss over four consecutive quarters. In divesting Brighthouse, MetLife’s total equity dropped by about 20 percent, and analysts have cautioned that it may not earn enough in the first three quarters of this year to offset the $2.1 billion net loss it reported for the fourth quarter of 2016.  Affected bondholders have until Aug. 18 to consent to MetLife’s proposed changes. The shareholder meeting is scheduled for Oct. 19. If bondholders do not consent, MetLife said it would have to convert $700 million worth of trust securities into junior subordinated debt, sell common stock to satisfy interest payment obligations and possibly face limits on the interest it can pay. Likewise, if shareholders do not approve changes, it could restrict MetLife’s ability to pay dividends or buy back stock.

503,MET,Giants hold off Jets' second-half rally to pull out win,"Giants hold off Jets’ second-half rally to pull out win EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Bryce Petty and Christian Hackenberg engineered four second-half touchdown drives to help the New York Jets overcome a 29-3 first-half deficit, but fell one point short in the New York Giants’ 32-31 victory in the annual MetLife Bowl. The first half saw the Giants defense take over the game. Defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul got things started for the Giants with his tackle of Jets running back Matt Forte in the end zone for the safety. After kicker Aldrick Rosas hit a 24-yard field goal to increase the Giants’ lead to 5-0, safety Landon Collins jumped a route on a Hackenberg pass intended for tight end Eric Tomlinson, the safety returning the ball 23 yards for a touchdown and a 12-0 lead. The Giants offense, which had not scored a touchdown in eight quarters of preseason play, finally snapped that streak later in the first quarter when running back Orleans Darkwa benefitted from the blocking of left tackle Ereck Flowers, fullback Shane Smith and tight end Evan Engram on a 1-yard rush into the end zone. The Jets finally got on the board in the second quarter on a 27-yard field goal by Chandler Catanzaro. But the Giants just kept piling it on, adding a 50-yard field goal by Mike Nugent. That was followed by the Giants defense producing their third score of the night, an interception returned for a touchdown by cornerback Donte Deayon, who caught the ball after receiver Robby Anderson coughed it up when drilled by Giants cornerback Janoris Jenkins. Hackenberg, who is trying to win the Jets’ starting quarterback job, struggled. He finished completing 12 of 21 pass attempts for 126 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. He was also sacked three times and had one rush for 13 yards. With the Giants taking their lead into the second half, the Jets offense started to come to life under Petty, who finished the evening 15 of 18 for 250 yards and three touchdowns before being knocked out late in the fourth quarter with a knee injury. Petty led the Jets to three third-quarter touchdowns, two to receiver ArDarius Stewart on a 25-yard post and a 15-yard score, and one on an 85-yard touchdown reception by running back Bilal Powell that cut the Giants’ lead to 29-18 going into the fourth quarter. Hackenberg brought the Jets within two points of a victory when he connected with receiver Frankie Hammond on a 17-yard touchdown. The two-point conversion attempt came up short. The Giants capped their scoring with a 54-yard field goal converted by Nugent, a former Jets kicker. This was the first time the Giants scored 30 or more points since Jan. 3, 2016, a 35-30 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2015 regular-season finale. The Jets responded with Petty’s third touchdown pass, a 15-yarder to Stewart to make it 32-25. Jets defensive lineman Leonard Williams left the game in the second quarter with a wrist injury, the only announced injury by the team. The Giants’ injury situation was worse. Starting defensive tackle Jay Bromley suffered a left knee sprain. Starting cornerback Eli Apple, who dealt with an ankle injury earlier this summer, left the game after the second quarter after aggravating the injury. Running back Shaun Draughn, who started the third quarter for the Giants, suffered a concussion and a neck injury. Safety Duke Ihenacho was ruled out with a knee injury suffered while trying to chase down Powell on his touchdown reception and run. Backup offensive lineman Adam Gettis was ruled out in the fourth quarter with a foot injury. And rookie defensive end Evan Schwan appeared to suffer a lower left leg injury with 1:52 left in the fourth quarter. The Jets will close out the preseason Thursday night in Philadelphia against the Eagles. The Giants will visit New England on Thursday to complete their preseason schedule.",8272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/fbn-jets-giants-writethru/giants-hold-off-jets-second-half-rally-to-pull-out-win-idUSMTZED8RBPLGK7
504,MET,"Fitch Affirms MetLife, Inc.'s Ratings; Outlook Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all existing ratings assigned to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) and its subsidiaries, including the Very Strong 'AA-' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings assigned to certain domestic life insurance companies and the 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) assigned to MetLife. The Rating Outlook for MetLife and its subsidiaries is Stable. A full list of rating actions is shown at the end of this release. Today's rating actions follow Fitch's review of MetLife's operating performance through first-half 2017 and reflect the recent successful completion of the separation of former MetLife businesses that now comprise Brighthouse Financial, Inc. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of MetLife's ratings reflects the company's very strong business profile, supported by very strong market positions in several major insurance product lines and markets in the U.S. and select international markets, as well as Fitch's view that the company's strong balance sheet fundamentals and excellent financial flexibility remain consistent with rating expectations. Fitch believes that the company's large scale and very strong brand name will continue to provide the company with significant competitive advantages. Fitch views the separation of the Brighthouse Financial-related businesses as neutral to MetLife's ratings since any decline in diversification of MetLife as a result of the separation will largely be mitigated by the lower risk profile of the businesses remaining within MetLife. MetLife's ratings also consider the company's above-average investment risk, lower operating profitability in 2015 and 2016 and continued macroeconomic challenges associated with the ongoing low interest rate environment. Fitch views the uncertainty around MetLife's ultimate status relative to the potential non-bank systematically important financial institution (SIFI) designation to be credit neutral. MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's solid risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch considers the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations to be strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's domestic life insurance subsidiaries (excluding American Life Insurance Company) reported combined statutory total adjusted capital of approximately $22 billion at year-end 2016, which resulted in consolidated risk-based capital (RBC) of 436%. Total adjusted capital associated with statutory entities that were separated as part of Brighthouse amounted to approximately $5.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2016. MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory solvency margin ratio of 957% at the end of first quarter 2017, which is above both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers. Holding company liquidity is derived from existing holding company cash balances and strong subsidiary dividend capacity, as well as the company's $2.5 billion commercial paper program and approximately $3.6 billion of unused corporate credit facilities at June 30, 2017. Operating company liquidity is enhanced by membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which allows MetLife to access funding on a collateralized basis. Financial leverage increased to approximately 29% at June 30, 2017, reflecting $3 billion in senior notes issued by Brighthouse in preparation for its August separation. Although the notes are no longer a part of MetLife's capital structure, Fitch expects that the reduction in equity associated with the separation will leave MetLife's financial leverage at a temporarily elevated state into 2018. Fitch anticipates that the company's financial leverage will return to its recent run-rate level of approximately 25% over the next 12-18 months. Fitch views MetLife's operating profitability to be fundamentally sound, but notes ongoing pressure from low interest rates and, over the past year, reserve charges associated with its actuarial assumption review and modeling improvements, as well as expenses related to the separation of Brighthouse. First half 2017 operating earnings improved somewhat relative to the same period in 2016, but low interest rates continue to subdue earnings growth. Fitch views MetLife's fixed-charge coverage metrics to be modestly below median guidelines for its current ratings, but reasonable given the company's overall profile. Fitch expects coverage metrics to temporarily weaken in the second half 2017 relative to first half 2017 as a result of the separation of earnings related to the Brighthouse businesses. However, as financial leverage decreases over the next 12-18 months and separation-related expense dissipate, Fitch expects coverage metrics to return to previous run-rate levels. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, run-rate ROE below 10%, and GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x.

505,MET,MetLife owes nurse full insurance amount despite missing info - 9th Circuit,"A federal appeals court on Wednesday reversed a verdict for Metropolitan Life Insurance Co, ruling that the company owed a California nurse the full amount of a life insurance policy she took out on her husband. A unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that MetLife must pay Susan Salyers the entire $250,000 policy even though she did not submit evidence of insurability as required under her employer’s benefits plan. MetLife waived that requirement by not asking for a statement of health while accepting her premium payments, the panel said.

507,MET,"MetLife operating income falls, authorizes $2 billion buyback","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) reported a 13.8 percent fall in quarterly operating income on Wednesday, hurt by a charge related to the spin off of its U.S. retail business, Brighthouse Financial, and the insurer authorized a $2 billion share buyback plan. MetLife said that it intends to divest its remaining Brighthouse Financial Inc (BHF.O) common stock through an exchange offer for MetLife common stock during 2018. The quarter included the results of Brighthouse’s final month with MetLife before the spinoff became effective on Aug. 4, following which MetLife ceded the title of the largest U.S. life insurer by assets to Prudential Financial (PRU.N). New York-based MetLife booked a third-quarter charge of $1.1 billion related to the Brighthouse spinoff, less than the $1.4 billion it had previously estimated. The third quarter is the first indication of how MetLife may perform without Brighthouse, whose assets include variable annuities, which led to swings in MetLife’s overall performance. “A lot of that volatility went out the door with Brighthouse,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Sean Dargan said before the company released its results. Net operating income, which excludes investment and derivative gains or losses, fell to $1.17 billion, or $1.09 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.36 billion, or $1.22 per share, a year earlier. [nBw3r2vF1a] Analysts on an average were expecting a quarterly profit of 90 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable. MetLife’s operating costs increased 4.6 percent to $14.99 billion. Variable investment income dropped nearly 20 percent to $236 million due to the sale of a real estate joint venture interest in the prior year period and lower prepayment fee income, the insurer said.

515,MET,Fitch Affirms MassMutual's Ratings; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all ratings for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) and its wholly owned domestic insurance subsidiaries and affiliates. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings consider MassMutual's very strong business profile, reflecting the company's strong market position in several major and broadly diversified business lines and very strong statutory capitalization. The ratings also consider the company's recent higher earnings variability from one-time charges, the ongoing impact of the low interest rate environment, and potential financial market volatility. MassMutual's very strong business profile reflects the company's leading position in the individual life insurance market selling participating whole life products through a career distribution system. MassMutual has a strong competitive position in many other lines of businesses, including group retirement and protection products, annuities and asset management capabilities, which provide diversification of earnings and cash flows. Fitch believes that the company's strong brand name, growing career distribution system, and strong earnings and cashflows from its asset management capabilities have provided the company significant competitive advantages. MassMutual's statutory capital is very strong and in line with rating expectations. At Dec. 31, 2016, total adjusted statutory capital (TAC) was $17.3 billion, risk-based capital (RBC) ratio was 459%, and the company had a Prism capital model score of 'Extremely Strong'. MassMutual's quality of capital is lower relative to that of highly rated mutual peers given its higher surplus notes to TAC ratio of 13%. However, this is largely offset by the company's conservative valuation of its asset management subsidiaries in reported statutory capital and lack of use of captives to finance redundant reserves. While surplus notes to TAC is above average, the ratio remains within Fitch's 15% guideline for standard surplus note notching. Fitch expects statutory financial leverage to decline modestly longer term due to growth in statutory capital. As of Sept. 30, 2017, MassMutual reported relatively low operating leverage of approximately 9x and asset leverage of approximately 14x, both of which are within rating expectations. Fitch considers MassMutual's profitability as moderate on an absolute basis and comparable with mutual peers. Recent operating performance has shown greater variability relative to historical results due partially to one-time charges. Operating results for the first three quarters of 2017 were higher relative to prior year due to strong investment performance, insurance margins, and higher fees from strong equity markets, but were partially offset by a one-time technology write-off and higher integration expenses related to the purchase of MetLife's retail distribution force. Operating results in 2016 were down relative to prior year as a result of acquisition costs of the aforementioned MetLife retail advisor purchase, lower net investment income, and increased reserves associated with variable annuity guarantees due to low interest rates. The ratings on C.M. Life Insurance Company (CM Life) and MML Bay State Life Insurance Company (MML Bay State), which are wholly owned subsidiaries of MassMutual, are based on Fitch's view that these entities are core operating companies within the MassMutual organization. MassMutual Global Funding, LLC is a limited liability company domiciled in the Cayman Islands. MassMutual Global Funding II is a statutory trust domiciled in the state of Delaware. The company and trust were established for the sole purpose of issuing debt instruments secured by funding agreements issued by MassMutual. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating sensitivities that could lead to an upgrade include: --NAIC RBC above 475% and maintaining a Prism capital model score of 'Extremely Strong'. --Surplus notes to TAC ratio below 9%. --Further growth and higher business concentrations in participating whole life business. Key rating sensitivities that could lead to a downgrade include: --Significant decline in TAC, NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 425%, or a Prism capital model score below 'Extremely Strong'. --Increased volatility in earnings due to unexpected losses. Rating sensitivities that could lead to wider notching of MassMutual's IDR include: --Surplus notes to TAC ratio above 15%. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company --Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) at 'AA+'; --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA'; --$250 million 7.625% surplus notes due Nov. 15, 2023 at 'AA-'; --$100 million 7.5% surplus notes due March 1, 2024 at 'AA-'; --$250 million 5.625% surplus notes due May 15, 2033 at 'AA-'; --$310 million 8.875% surplus notes due June 1, 2039 at 'AA-'; --$400 million 5.375% surplus notes due Dec. 1, 2041 at 'AA-'; --$500 million 4.50% surplus notes due April 15, 2065 at 'AA-'; --$475 million 4.90% surplus notes due April 1, 2077 at 'AA-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper program at 'F1+'.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

518,MET,UPDATE 2-Massachusetts and NY probing MetLife over unpaid pensions,"(Reuters) - Regulators in Massachusetts and New York State said on Monday they are probing MetLife Inc (MET.N) after the insurer revealed last week it had failed to pay pensions to potentially thousands of people. “Retirees cannot afford to have glitches with their pension checks,” Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, the state’s top securities regulator, said in a statement announcing an investigation. “I want to uncover why this occurred and how MetLife is going to rectify the problem for the retirees,” Galvin said. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which regulates insurers and banks in the state, said on Monday that it is reviewing the matter. MetLife said on Friday that it believed the group missing out on the payments represented less than 5 percent of about 600,000 people who receive a type of annuity benefit from the company via its retirement business. Those affected generally have average benefits of less than $150 a month, MetLife said.  “We are deeply disappointed that we fell short of our own high standards,” MetLife said. “Our customers deserve better. We are committed to making this right for our customers. We found the issue, we self-reported it, and we are committed to doing better.” New York’s regulator was aware of the issue prior to MetLife’s disclosure, NYDFS Superintendent Maria Vullo said. “The department is currently reviewing the matter and will work with MetLife to remediate the issue and ensure that all MetLife’s outstanding pension obligations are fulfilled,” Vullo said. MetLife, which pledged to fully cooperate with regulators, said the standard way for finding retirees who are owed benefits is no longer sufficient. “While it is still difficult to track everyone down, we have not been as aggressive as we could have been,” MetLife said in a statement. “When we realized this was a significant issue, we launched an effort to do three things: figure out what happened, strengthen our processes so that we do a better job locating retirees, and promptly pay anyone we find - as we always do,” the company said.  MetLife said it is now using “enhanced techniques” to locate and promptly pay any those who may be entitled to benefits.

526,MET,"Greenlight's Einhorn bets on Brighthouse, makes money on GM","BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn told investors on Tuesday that he made a “large” bet on insurer Brighthouse Financial late last year, and had made money on General Motors but lost by shorting Amazon and Tesla. Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital bought into Brighthouse, MetLife’s former U.S. retail life-insurance business, at an average cost of $57.92, according to a letter sent to clients and seen by Reuters. The stock is now trading at $63.90. The fund manager said General Motors, which was his firm’s biggest winner last year, remains “significantly under valued” given the automaker’s “impressive fundamental performance.” But Einhorn also said he again lost money by betting that a group of fast-growing technology stocks, including Amazon, Netflix, and Tesla, would fall. “The biggest losers for the year were our short positions on the ‘bubble basket’,” Einhorn wrote. Greenlight Capital, whose annualized 15.4 percent return over more than two decades make it one of the world’s most closely watched hedge funds, posted only a modest return in 2017. The firm’s 1.6 percent gain trailed the Standard & Poor’s 500 21.8 percent gain and Einhorn said it was a tough year for so-called value investors like himself. “While it feels like we have been running face first into the wind, we don’t intend to capitulate and are sticking to our strategy of being long (on) misunderstood value and shorting ‘not value’,” he wrote. Greenlight made money on German energy company Uniper and performance chemicals business Chemours, and took new stakes in offshore rigs operator Ensco and social media company Twitter. Time Warner was bought again because Greenlight thinks the planned merger with AT&T; will go through. And if it doesn’t, “TWX has several strategic options to create value,” said Einhorn. Einhorn was candid about his losses, noting that his bet on pharmacy retailer Rite Aid, in which he invested at $7.45 a share, did not turn out the way he expected. He exited at $2.78 a share. Greenlight is still betting that the price of gold will rise, but Einhorn said the firm lost money on the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF and got out. “We don’t need additional exposure to mining equities to express that view,” he wrote.

MetLife and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a top federal panel of financial regulators, filed a joint motion to dismiss an earlier FSOC appeal, the company announced in a statement. The move marks another significant shift for the administration of President Donald Trump in its efforts to ease back stricter rules established under former President Barack Obama. “I am pleased that the Justice Department has settled the MetLife case, consistent with the recommendation by a majority of FSOC voting members,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who chairs the FSOC, in a statement. “I will be working with the Council to clarify and revise the non-bank designation rule and guidance.” Backers of tougher rules established after the 2007-2009 financial crisis insist allowing regulators to identify specific firms for stricter scrutiny as key cogs of the financial system is a critical tool. But conservative critics argued the FSOC applied the power in an inconsistent and opaque fashion. In November, the Treasury Department recommended the FSOC shift away from singling out specific companies, and instead focus on broader risks facing the financial system. After a handful of non-bank financial companies were designed as “systemically important financial institutions” meriting stricter rules under Obama, MetLife mounted a legal fight against the regulatory decision. The insurance company originally won a case at a U.S. district court, but the Obama administration appealed the ruling in 2016. Thursday’s agreement ensures MetLife will not face those stricter rules. The FSOC voted in September to remove a similar designation for American International Group Inc, and GE Capital was able to escape the label in 2016 after overhauling its business. Prudential Financial Inc now is the only non-bank SIFI still under stricter government oversight.

533,MET,UPDATE 1-U.S. SEC looking into MetLife's failure to pay some pensions,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc said on Monday the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the insurer’s failure to pay some workers’ pensions. MetLife, in a statement, said the SEC’s enforcement staff has inquired about payments that the insurer failed to make for people who receive a type of annuity benefit from the company via its retirement business. Less than 5 percent of 600,000 people are affected, the company has said. The New York insurer estimated increasing total reserves by between $525 million and $575 million on a pre-tax basis, resulting in a hit to fourth-quarter earnings of $135 million to $165 million. Last month, MetLife said it failed to pay pensions to possibly tens of thousands of people and would have to strengthen its reserves because of the costs of finding and repaying them. “To date, MetLife is not aware of any intentional wrongdoing in connection with this matter,” the company said on Monday, adding that it was responding to the SEC’s questions. MetLife shares closed at $54.40, down 0.7 percent. The insurer is reviewing its processes and procedures for identifying people who receive the type of group annuity benefit at issue as well as pension beneficiaries, it said. Regulators in Massachusetts and New York state said in December they were probing the pension payment issue. [L1N1OI197] MetLife has postponed its fourth-quarter earnings report and conference call, which had been scheduled for this week, to Feb. 13 and 14, respectively, the company said.

537,MET,SEC looking into MetLife's failure to pay some pensions,"(Reuters) - MetLife Inc said on Monday the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the insurer’s failure to pay some workers’ pensions. MetLife, in a statement, said the SEC’s enforcement staff has inquired about payments that the insurer failed to make for people who receive a type of annuity benefit from the company via its retirement business. Less than 5 percent of 600,000 people are affected, the company has said. The New York insurer estimated increasing total reserves by between $525 million and $575 million on a pre-tax basis, resulting in a hit to fourth-quarter earnings of $135 million to $165 million. Last month, MetLife said it failed to pay pensions to possibly tens of thousands of people and would have to strengthen its reserves because of the costs of finding and repaying them. “To date, MetLife is not aware of any intentional wrongdoing in connection with this matter,” the company said on Monday, adding that it was responding to the SEC’s questions. MetLife shares closed at $54.40, down 0.7 percent. The insurer is reviewing its processes and procedures for identifying people who receive the type of group annuity benefit at issue as well as pension beneficiaries, it said. Regulators in Massachusetts and New York state said in December they were probing the pension payment issue. [L1N1OI197] MetLife has postponed its fourth-quarter earnings report and conference call, which had been scheduled for this week, to Feb. 13 and 14, respectively, the company said.

546,MET,"MetLife adjusted profit slumps on pension-related charge, tax changes","Feb 13 (Reuters) - Metlife Inc’s adjusted quarterly profit fell 36 percent due to changes in the U.S. tax law and a reserve charge after failing to pay some workers’ pensions. The insurer, which announced its results after a two-week delay, said adjusted fourth-quarter earnings fell to $678 million, or 64 cents per share, compared with $1.1 billion, or 95 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts were expecting earnings of 64 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MetLife booked a fourth-quarter $70 million after-tax charge to cover the costs of finding and repaying the potentially tens of thousands of people to whom it failed to pay pensions. Some life insurers, including MetLife, take over corporate pension plans from companies that want to offload them. The insurers then use a group annuity to make regular payments to the retirees who are entitled to benefits under those pensions. Changes to the U.S. tax code resulted in a $298 million hit to adjusted earnings, the company said. Total adjusted revenue rose to $15.4 million from $15.3 million. In December, MetLife said it had failed to make pension payments to thousands of workers. On Jan. 29, MetLife said its group annuity reserves fell short because of a “material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.” The company said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the matter and said it was delaying its quarterly results to account for the reserve build.

548,MET,"MetLife says pension failures go back 25 years, hurt fourth quarter profit","(Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N) on Tuesday said internal failures that resulted in its not making payments to thousands of pensioners stretched back a quarter of a century and it would take a major effort this year to fix the problems. The pension problem has dogged Metlife since it revealed the omission in December, prompting investigations by regulators, a two-week delay in the publication of its quarterly earnings and a $70 million charge in the fourth quarter. That charge, along with a hit from U.S. tax changes, helped drag its adjusted quarterly earnings down by over a third.  In total, Metlife raised reserves by $510 million to cover the cost of compensating those affected. The insurer estimates that about 13,500 people could be due payments. “We remain committed to doing better and are taking the necessary steps to fix the situation,” MetLife’s chief financial officer, John Hele, said in a video presentation to investors on Tuesday.  Some life insurers, including MetLife, take over corporate pension plans from companies that want to offload them. The insurers then use a group annuity to make regular payments to the retirees who are entitled to benefits under those pensions.     MetLife’s problems - it made only two attempts to find the pensioners - has put other insurers on the defensive.  “This issue is certainly getting a lot of attention in the market,” Prudential Financial Inc’s (PRU.N) vice chairman, Mark Grier, said during a fourth quarter earnings call with analysts earlier this month.  “Given the size and the age of our block of business, there are inevitably some customers we can’t locate for a number of reasons, but that number is small,” Grier said.  MetLife’s fourth-quarter adjusted quarterly profit fell 36 percent, to $678 million, or 64 cents per share, compared with the same period a year earlier, the company reported on Tuesday. The result matched analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In addition to the $70 million reserve charge, changes in the U.S. tax law cost the company $298 million in the fourth quarter. The insurer anticipates a $650 million to $850 million after-tax adjusted loss for 2018. Overall, MetLife’s total adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter rose to $15.4 billion from $15.3 billion.

565,MET,"MetLife trims compensation for CEO, CFO in year marked by errors","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (MET.N) reduced total 2017 compensation for its chief executive and chief financial officer, a year marked by two key errors, including payments it failed to make to pensioners whom it could not locate, according to a filing on Thursday. MetLife CEO Steven Kandarian received total compensation of $14.7 million, a 3.6 percent drop from $15.3 million he received in 2016, MetLife said in its proxy filing. Total compensation for the New York-based insurer’s CFO, John Hele, dropped by 6.4 percent, to $5.3 million from $5.7 million, according to the filing, a change that reflects MetLife’s “performance in managing financial matters, including material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting,” MetLife said. MetLife revealed two errors in 2017, including internal failures that resulted in the insurer not making payments to 13,500 pensioners whose plans MetLife took over from private companies. The problem, which MetLife is in the process of trying to fix by locating and paying the pensioners, stretched back 25 years, the company said in January. In February, the company had to boost reserves by $510 million pretax because it had previously released funds for its obligations to the pensioners. In March, MetLife said it uncovered a reserve miscalculation for a Japanese annuity product during a review it launched in late 2017 and completed early this year. “MetLife did not live up to the high standards we set for ourselves,” Kandarian wrote in his annual letter, also on Thursday.  The company reduced a cash annual incentive compensation award for each of the two executives by 25 percent to $3 million for Kandarian and $1.5 million for Hele.   MetLife also considered MetLife’s total shareholder return in its analysis, it said.

The U.S. insurer reported adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.36 per share, compared to $1.3 billion, or $1.20 per share in the same period of 2017.

578,MET,"MetLife to provide pension benefits to 41,000 FedEx retirees through annuity","(Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N) has entered into an agreement to provide pension benefits for about 41,000 FedEx Corp (FDX.N) retirees and beneficiaries through an annuity, the two companies said on Tuesday. MetLife and FedEx expect to close the deal, which includes about $6 billion in pension obligations, on May 10, they said. The deal is the first “jumbo-sized” U.S. transfer of pension obligations to an insurer, measured by premium, since 2013, wrote Wells Fargo Securities LLC analyst Sean Dargan in a research note late on Tuesday.  It also marks MetLife’s entry into the market for jumbo-sized transfers, Dargan wrote. The insurer has historically competed for pension transfer deals with less than $1 million in premiums, Dargan wrote.  Some life insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) and  MetLife, take over corporate pension plans from companies that want to offload them. The insurers then use a group annuity to make regular payments to the retirees and beneficiaries who are entitled to benefits under those pensions. These deals, known as pension risk transfers, have been around for at least 90 years, but rising interest rates and stock market values are expected to make it easier for more companies unload their plans to insurers. In 2017, MetLife disclosed that it had failed to make payments to pensioners whom it could not locate after taking over their plans from private companies. MetLife since been trying to locate the individuals, whom it intends to pay, the company has said. The deal “is a vote of confidence after MET’s group annuitant issues and charges of the recent past,” Dargan wrote. FedEx’s purchase of the group annuity contract will be funded by assets of its pension plan, the company said.  The amount of monthly payments to the pensioners will not change, the companies said.
