1,FOX,"Analysis: Charges unlikely, but Murdoch tape won't help his business case","LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The recall of Rupert Murdoch to a committee of the British parliament over a secret tape of him dismissing the alleged illegal behavior of his journalists is likely to cause personal embarrassment for the world’s most famous media mogul but no criminal charges. It could, however, further complicate his business dealings in Britain, where his firm has long wanted to take full control of the pay-TV group BSkyB and where it is still locked in negotiations with the government over regulation of the press. The 82-year-old head of News Corp and 21st Century Fox has been recalled to appear before lawmakers in London - the scene two years ago of what he called his “most humble day” - to explain his recorded comments that British tabloid newspapers had for decades paid bribes to police for information. No date has yet been set for the committee hearing. Murdoch also said in the tape, covertly recorded during his meeting with News Corp’s Sun journalists in March, that he had been wrong to give so much help to the police as they probed a phone-hacking scandal that engulfed his British newspaper business, and that he would, at the right time, hit back. The revelations have raised questions in Britain over whether Murdoch could himself face charges, and the police have said they wish to obtain the tape to review the contents. They have also given more ammunition to Murdoch’s critics, who accuse him of using his newspapers to wield huge influence over politicians and undermine the rule of law. But legal sources, consultants and media observers in both Britain and the United States said the chances of him facing individual charges were slim. In Britain, they said Murdoch’s comments revealed no specific knowledge of wrongdoing by his reporters, and even the policeman leading the broader investigations characterized the remarks as showing empathy with staff. Two U.S. law enforcement sources told Reuters that a U.S. criminal action against Murdoch personally was highly unlikely. The same people said that while the FBI and U.S. Justice Department have been conducting investigations into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by people working for Murdoch, those investigations did not appear to be close to a resolution. Legal sources and experts say that any U.S. probe may well not be resolved until after criminal investigations by the British authorities are completed, which could take months to over a year. News Corp declined to comment. The sound of Murdoch railing against the police and dismissing the payment of bribes as “next to nothing” stands in stark contrast to the image he had previously presented. Appearing for lengthy questioning before the committee two years ago alongside his son James, he had described himself as appalled by revelations of illegality and phone-hacking. “He came to tell us that it was the most humble day of his life, and he was seemingly contrite, and yet the opposite comes out of these taped remarks,” one of the committee members Paul Farrelly told Reuters. “In terms of paying people for information, it’s a criminal offence to do that with public officials. For Rupert Murdoch to say that that was all part of a culture seems like he is excusing that behavior.” Claire Enders, a high-profile media consultant in Britain, said while the comments were unlikely to cause problems for Murdoch the man, they could cause trouble for his companies. Confronted by a wave of public outrage over the revelations about hacking, the then combined News Corp group was forced to pull a $14 billion bid to buy the 61 percent of the highly profitable BSkyB it did not already own. The scandal also prompted Britain’s media regulator to examine, and later clear, BSkyB as “fit and proper” to hold a broadcasting license, due to News Corp’s 39 percent stake. But Enders said the tape could make it harder for Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, which was spun out of the wider News Corp group, to one day make another bid for the rest of BSkyB. “It’s a corporate governance issue, and we think that this makes the famous re-emergence of the BSkyB bid extremely unlikely,” she said. She added that the tacit toleration of bribery at a business controlled by the Murdoch family could even encourage the regulator Ofcom to look again at the ownership of BSkyB, especially if further damaging evidence emerges from the criminal trials that are due to start in September this year. So far, investors have shrugged off any potential collateral damage from the latest news to surface in Britain. News Corp shares are up 0.4 percent at $14.93 since the transcripts and recording of the tape surfaced in British media on July 3. “This noise from an investing standpoint is a great opportunity to find value,” said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which holds shares in both News Corp and Fox. Lowenstein is in News Corp for the balance sheet - which has more than $2 billion in cash and no debt - and for its mix of assets that include Australian pay-TV services and the strong brand of The Wall Street Journal.

2,FOX,Fox loses appeal over Dish's 'Hopper' ad-skipper,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s effort to stop Dish Network Corp from selling devices that let viewers skip over commercials on primetime broadcast shows. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court judge’s refusal to temporarily halt sales of Dish’s Hopper, which contains the ad-skipping feature known as AutoHop, and a related “marsupial-inspired” product called the Joey. Introduced last year, AutoHop is available on shows recorded with Dish’s PrimeTime Anytime feature, which lets subscribers record Fox, ABC, CBS and NBC primetime programs with one click, and replay them commercial-free starting the day after they broadcast. Recordings can be saved for eight days. Fox and other networks have complained that AutoHop infringes their copyrights, and could reduce revenue from advertisers who are fearful that subscribers might fast-forward past their commercials. Dish is the second-largest U.S. satellite TV provider, and has about 14 million customers. Its mascot for the Hopper is a kangaroo. Last November, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles said the parent of the Fox Broadcasting Co network did not deserve a preliminary injunction to stop sales of products featuring AutoHop or PrimeTime Anytime. She said Fox failed to show that it would likely prevail on its copyright infringement and breach of contract claims, or otherwise face irreparable harm if sales were to continue. Writing for a three-judge 9th Circuit panel, Circuit Judge Sidney Thomas agreed that the copyright claims might fail because it is “the user, not Dish” who makes the alleged illegal copies of Fox programs such as “Glee” and “The Simpsons.” He said the breach of contract issue was a “much closer call” given Dish’s 2010 agreement to disable fast-forwarding through commercials in “video on demand” programs. But applying a “very deferential” standard of review, he said Gee “did not clearly err” in concluding that PrimeTime Anytime more closely resembled a DVR. The 9th Circuit did not address the merits of Fox’s case. Wednesday’s decision could “encourage other pay-TV providers to offer similar services,” wrote Christopher King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We suspect broadcasters are factoring potential ad-skipping losses into their demands for retransmission-content payments from Dish.” Twenty-First Century Fox spokesman Scott Grogin said the New York-based company is disappointed with the decision. “This is not about consumer choice or advances in technology. It is about a company devising an unlicensed, unauthorized service,” he said. “We will review all of our options and proceed accordingly.” Stanton Dodge, Dish’s general counsel, said the Englewood, Colorado-based company is pleased with the decision, calling it a victory for consumers in an “important fight over the fundamental rights of consumer choice and control.” The Fox networks were once part of News Corp, which recently split broadcasting and movie operations from its publishing operations, which include the Wall Street Journal. ABC is owned by Walt Disney Co, CBS by CBS Corp, and NBC by Comcast Corp. CBS and NBC, like Fox, also sued Dish last year in California over the Hopper. The case is Fox Broadcasting Co et al v. Dish Network LLC et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 12-57048.

Lewis was terminated for cause on July 25, it said. Lewis could not be reached for comment. An auto-reply to an email sent to Lewis at Fox News said he was out of the office. Lewis previously worked as head of communications for CNBC and was part of the original team that Fox News Chairman and Chief Executive Roger Ailes assembled to launch the network in the mid-1990s. No successor for Lewis has been named. ",8212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fox-lewis/fox-news-fires-communications-chief-for-financial-irregularities-idUSL2N0GM00A20130821

9,FOX,Murdoch re-elected Twenty-First Century Fox chairman,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Media mogul Rupert Murdoch was re-elected chairman of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc despite protests from shareholder groups who sought to separate the chairman and chief executive positions of the family-dominated company. Shareholders elected the 82-year-old CEO, his two sons, Lachlan and James, and the rest of the company’s 12-person board during the meeting on Friday at the Fox studio lot in Los Angeles. Shareholders Christian Brothers Investment Services and the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation in Canada unsuccessfully proposed the appointment of an independent chair of the company, citing “the level of family control, and the influence this may bring to the impending reorganization.” Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended shareholders vote against Murdoch and eight other directors including his sons, saying the company should have put its poison pill plan to a shareholder vote. News Corp announced the poison pill provision in May before Murdoch split News Corp into two companies, with News Corp retaining the newspaper and other media assets and Twenty-First Century Fox holding the movie, TV and other entertainment properties. The poison pill would be triggered to prevent a hostile takeover if a buyer acquired 15 percent or more of either company. “Our new company deserves a fresh start” Timothy Schaler, an investor adviser for Christian Brothers, said at the meeting. “For the board to ignore such a mandate shows disregard for corporate governance.” In addition to its recommendations to vote against the Murdochs, the ISS proxy advisory firm recommended a rejection of Twenty-First Century Fox president Chase Carey and board members David DeVoe, Roderick Eddington, James Breyer, Viet Dinh and Alvaro Uribe. It endorsed independent directors Delphine Arnault, Jacques Nasser, and Robert Silberman, who were added to the board in June. Twenty-First Century Fox countered the ISS rejection of board members by contending it needs Rupert Murdoch’s “unique insight and strategic vision” in the joint ceo-chairman role and said the current board has delivered good returns for shareholders. Class A shares of Twenty-First Century Fox was trading at $34.33, up 0.4 percent, in mid-afternoon trading on the Nasdaq exchange. It has jumped 16.9 percent since July 1, its first day of trading after the split. “The company has articulated a strong case for long-term growth after the separation and they have begun to execute impressively. We think the separation so far has been a terrific move,” said David Bank, analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ISS’ recommendations were a reversal from last year when it urged shareholders to back the slate. But in 2011, ISS recommended clients vote against almost all of the board members amid News Corp’s telephone hacking scandal that prompted the closing of the News of the World tabloid and scotched its bid for the remaining stake of British pay-TV provider BSkyB. The annual meeting in 2011 attracted about 100 protesters, TV crews and Tom Watson, a British member of parliament, who flew in to voice complaints about the hacking scandal. The Murdochs control 39.4 percent of the company’s voting rights through Class B shares, according to the company proxy. HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz, a frequent Murdoch ally, owns 7 percent. “The shareholder proposals are interesting politically but not realistic since Murdoch’s got the support of Alwaleed and the family’s own holdings,” said Matthew Harrigan, analyst with Wunderlich Securities Inc. “Additionally, the stock has performed very well,” he told Reuters on Wednesday.

No price was announced for the acquistion, but a person with knoweldge of the transaction said it was close to $100 million. The Chernin Group said it will maintain majority control although Crunchyroll management and existing investor TV Tokyo will maintain a “significant” stake. “Our plan is to continue to grow the anime vertical as well as launch new channels in different genres,” Chernin said in the statement. The Chernin Group, which has financial backing from Providence Equity Partners and Qatar Holdings, produces films and TV shows.

16,FOX,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Genting to spend $3-4 bln in Las Vegas in push for U.S. gaming empire,"(Corrects to Twentieth Century Fox from Twenty-First Century Fox in 6th paragraph) * Investment depends on whether Genting gets license * Genting’s U.S. assets have doubled over past 18 months * Genting to fund Las Vegas investment with own cash By Siva Sithraputhran KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Genting Bhd, Southeast Asia’s biggest gaming group, will spend an initial $3 billion to $4 billion to develop an unfinished resort on the Las Vegas strip, as it seeks to build a U.S. empire of casino and leisure assets. The Malaysian company is seeking to expand in the United States as the world’s largest economy starts to recover, and as various states relax restrictions ranging from casino licenses to online gambling. Genting, which has held Malaysia’s sole casino licence since the 1960s, has focused its international expansion drive on the United States. It opened a casino in New York City in 2011 and has since bought upmarket waterfront properties in Miami. Genting bought the Las Vegas resort this year from Boyd Gaming Corp for $350 million, in its first push into the U.S. gambling mecca dominated by the likes of Las Vegas Sands . Construction of the resort was suspended in 2008 after the onset of the global financial crisis. “We are looking at $3-4 billion in total if we get approval for a casino licence (in Las Vegas),” Chief Executive Officer Lim Kok Thay, who was widely credited with Genting’s global expansion, told reporters. Lim was speaking after the launch of Genting’s $400 million project to build a theme park with Twentieth Century Fox for its hilltop casino in Malaysia. The project is part of a five-year plan by unit Genting Malaysia Bhd to spend close to $1 billion to spruce up Malaysia’s only casino, which faces of increasing competition as Southeast Asian countries open up to gaming companies. Shares in Genting closed up 1.4 percent at 10.24 ringgit before the Las Vegas announcement, outperforming the broader market that rose 0.7 percent. Lim said Genting will use its own money for the Las Vegas investment. Its cash position grew 3.8 percent to 19.1 billion ringgit ($5.90 billion) in July-September from a year earlier, giving it ample room for U.S. investment. Genting’s U.S. assets have nearly doubled to 4.8 billion ringgit over the past 18 months, though the revenue they yield made up just 5.4 percent of the company’s 4.6 billion ringgit third-quarter total. Revenue is likely to be steady at its $830 million Resorts World Casino in the Queens district of New York City. It is likely to enjoy a period without direct competition as no more casino licenses will be issued for the area for at least seven years. Its $3 billion hotel and casino plan for the Miami waterfront, however, stalled last year after a Florida House of Representatives committee postponed a vote on a bill to relax restrictions on casinos. Unperturbed, Lim, who succeeded his father in 2003, said the properties Genting bought in Miami have become a gateway for its beach front casino in the Bahamas.

But there is plenty that Mindich likes for the start of 2014 as well, saying the fund owns some mid-to-large cap stocks where some catalyst should help push prices up. This includes Sotheby’s, where activist hedge fund managers are pressing for an overhaul of operations, and Marathon Petroleum as well as aerospace supplier Spirit Aerosystems. The fund owns all three stocks. “We feel very good about the strength of our investment engine across all areas of our business,” the $10 billion hedge fund wrote in a letter to investors dated January 16 and seen by Reuters on Friday. The average hedge fund rose 9 percent last year. Some of last year’s biggest winners have already been removed from the portfolio as the stocks’ share prices climbed, Eton Park said. The firm exited 21st Century Fox after the stock rose 57 percent in 2013 and was up 150 percent from when Eton Park first bought the shares in 2011. Similarly the firm sold out of Liberty Global , another top contributor to last year’s gains, after shares rose 42 percent last year, and retailer Dollar Tree, having achieved a 40 percent gain on that stock. It also exited Chipotle, Priceline and Ralph Lauren last year. A spokesman for the fund declined to comment. “Over the course of 2013, we shifted the portfolio considerably, allocating capital to areas with greater risk/reward prospects,” the letter said. Investment picks at Eton Park are widely followed in the industry after the 10-year old fund put up strong numbers. It was so popular at its launch that Mindich was able to impose some of the toughest investment conditions in the industry. The fund was up 12.6 percent in 2012 after falling 11 percent in 2011. Eton Park’s so-called short bets, where the fund expects stocks to fall, hurt performance. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 32.4 percent. Short bets against Vestas Wind, unidentified U.S. auto-related companies and a U.S. consumer discretionary company the fund also did not identify, were listed as Eton Park’s top “losers” for 2013. For this year, Eton Park also sees the chance for more mergers and acquisitions as interest rates are expected to remain low for some time and corporate balance sheets are healthy. Late last year Eton Park told investors that it would cut management fees and create a more liquid share class this year, moving in line with a general trend in the $2.5 trillion industry.

23,FOX,"Weaker movies, ratings force Fox to trim outlook","(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc, the television and film company split off from News Corp last June, lowered its fiscal-year outlook on Thursday, blaming missed targets at its movie studio and weak broadcast network ratings. However, its shares rose nearly 3 percent as investors shrugged off the news and focused instead on the company’s long-term prospects, which analysts said are boosted by its focus on sports and profitable stable of cable networks. “Ratings trends are not a surprise and are pretty ugly but the fundamental strategy of investing aggressively in sports and cable networks show Fox is making the correct long term investments to build the business,” said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. Fox shares rose almost 3 percent before slipping back to trade up 1.8 percent at $32.29. The stock is trading up more than 10 percent since the June split. Chief Financial Officer John Nallen said on a conference call Fox was lowering its full year forecast of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to mid-to-high single digit percentage growth. That was down from high single digit to low double digit percentage growth that it previously announced. The company, which owns cable networks such as Fox News and FX, reported results for its fiscal second-quarter to December 31. Nallen said the film unit underperformed company expectations and ratings for musical TV contests “The X Factor” and “American Idol” were weaker-than-expected. Evercore analyst Alan Gould said he expected Fox to lower its forecast but maintained that “Fox is the quickest growing of the entertainment conglomerates. Fox said its domestic advertising revenue increased 7 percent in the quarter. That beat U.S. cable network rivals Viacom and Time Warner Inc, which each reported slower growth than Fox in the quarter. The company credited the ad increase to double digit growth at FX networks, its new sports network Fox Sports 1 and its regional sports networks. Fox has spending heavily on sports, going after Walt Disney Co’s ESPN on a national basis with its Fox Sports 1 channel that launched in August. Fox said its expenses rose 22 percent to $1.6 billion in the quarter, partly due to some of these sports investments. On January 24, it took an 80 percent stake in the YES Network, a regional sports channel focused on the New York Yankees baseball team. Fox recorded $8.16 billion of total revenue in the quarter, a 15 percent increase from the same period a year earlier. Analysts were expecting revenue of $7.89 billion. Net income was $1.2 billion, or 53 cents per share, down from $2.38 billion a year ago, or $1.01 per share. Excluding items such as BSkyB’s share buyback program, earnings per share were 33 cents, which matched Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fox’s filmed entertainment unit, which includes its movie studio, saw revenue fall 21 percent without the hits it had a year earlier in the quarter such as “Taken 2”. It also had “higher theatrical release costs” in the quarter for “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” and “Walking with Dinosaurs”.

25,FOX,Media executives question Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal,"(Reuters) - One of the top executives of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has raised questions about Comcast’s potential dominance of the U.S. broadband Internet market if regulators allow its $45.2 billion merger with Time Warner Cable to be completed. Speaking at an investor conference on Tuesday, Chase Carey, Fox president and chief operating officer, said the “broadband issue” will be front and center when U.S. regulators review the tie-up that merges the No. 1 and No. 2 cable operators. Asked about concerns over the merger, Carey said, “Probably the issue that will come out of it, and that will ultimately get focused on, is really the broadband issue. Is there choice in broadband? Are you really headed toward every home having simply one broadband provider, and what are the implications of that?” If its bid for Time Warner Cable is approved, Comcast would be the Internet provider to about 40 percent of U.S. households paying for high-speed Internet access, analysts estimate. As TV service becomes more personalized with new navigation tools and targeted advertising, broadband infrastructure, and who controls that service, will become even more critical, Carey said. There has not been any pushback so far from companies against the deal, he added. “We haven’t seen any filings yet and how does that get addressed? I assume there will be aspects of that that are addressed,” he said. “Potentially, you may have for most of the country, simply one wired broadband pipe and again that’s the piece that will get, at the end of the day, most focused on,” he said. Comcast did not respond to a request for comment. Also at the same conference, Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes predicted a government role in bolstering post-merger competition. “In the longer run there are some questions on competition that any deal like this will look at, the government will look at and make sure the appropriate conditions are in place to optimize competition,” Bewkes said. DirecTV’s CEO Mike White, who was already called for regulatory scrutiny of the deal, said on Tuesday, that the government will likely focus on “all the aspects of Internet, from net neutrality to you name it.” He also said the government should consider whether Comcast is a national business instead of a local one which “requires the government to take a different perspective.” Once Comcast files its merger documents with regulators, the Justice Department and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission will both take months to review the merger’s impact on competition, focusing on antitrust and public interest concerns respectively.

28,FOX,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Tele2 appoints new chief financial officer,"(Corrects in third paragraph to show Shine Group owned by 21st Century Fox, not privately owned) * Tele2 appoints Allison Kirkby as new CFO * Move is latest in a series of management changes * Tele2 recently lost key spectrum auction in Norway STOCKHOLM, March 20 (Reuters) - Tele2 has appointed a new chief financial officer, the latest in a series of top management changes at the telecoms operator which recently lost a key spectrum auction in Norway. Tele2 said on Thursday it had appointed Allison Kirkby to replace long-serving CFO Lars Nilsson. Kirkby’s most recent position was chief financial officer for British television production and distribution firm Shine Group, owned by 21st Century Fox. Tele2’s CEO Mats Granryd said there was no connection between Nilsson’s departure and the situation in Norway following the loss of the frequency auction there in December. “Absolutely not,” Granryd told Reuters. Tele2’s head of strategy had left earlier this year while the chief executive of its operations in the Netherlands - where the firm is building a mobile network and plans to launch 4G services - left at the end of last year. In February, Tele2 forecast core earnings of around 6.0 billion crowns ($944 million) for 2014, less than the average 6.3 billion expected in a Reuters poll. It also scrapped its 2015 forecast due to uncertainty about Norway. Tele2 is Norway’s third-largest mobile operator behind Telenor and Teliasonera. Tele2 had already cut its 2015 guidance due to expectations for higher costs and increased competition. In March, Tele2 said it had hired investment bank ABG Sundal Collier to review its options in Norway, including a sale.

30,FOX,21st Century Fox appoints Lachlan Murdoch non-executive co-chairman,"March 26 (Reuters) - Media and entertainment company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc  said its board has appointed Lachlan Murdoch non-executive co-chairman and elevated James Murdoch to the position of co-chief operating officer. Lachlan, son of Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch, will work closely with the senior management to develop global strategies and guiding the overall corporate agenda, the company said on Wednesday. “In this elevated role, Lachlan will help us lead News Corp forward as we expand our reach and invest in new technologies and markets around the world,” Rupert said in a statement. Seven years ago, Lachlan Murdoch turned his back on the business his grandfather founded, quitting his role as deputy chief operating officer after banging heads with his father and the top lieutenants. Since then, he has been focusing on his business interests in Australia through his private investment company Illyria Pty Ltd, which owns various media assets. He also owns about 9 percent of Australia’s third-ranked TV network, Ten Network Holdings Ltd. Lachlan, 42, is currently a director at Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and News Corp.

31,FOX,"Prodigal son returns, Lachlan Murdoch back in News Corp","* Lachlan returns to News fold after some spectacular failures * Murdoch media empire “like the royal family” - academic * Lachlan to split time between New York and Sydney By Jane Wardell and Byron Kaye SYDNEY, March 27 (Reuters) - Lachlan Murdoch’s appointment to senior positions within his father Rupert Murdoch’s media empire marks the return of the prodigal son. Nearly a decade after walking away from the News Corp  inner circle in New York to set up his own investment company and settle in Sydney with his young family, it appears Lachlan has accepted the mantle of successor, whether alone or jointly with younger brother James. “It’s like the royal family,” said Alan Knight, professor of journalism at the University of Technology in Sydney. “Murdoch senior has always treated News Corp as a family business and this guy is just basically accepting his inheritance.” Lachlan, 42, will become non-executive co-chairman of both entertainment company 21st Century Fox and publishing operation News Corp, sharing both roles with his father. He rejoins the company after quitting as deputy chief operating officer in 2005 amid friction with other News Corp executives. However, Lachlan’s track record after striking out on his own has been marked by several spectacular failures. His first move, a highly leveraged A$3.3 billion ($3.04 billion) bid with friend and fellow media dynasty heir James Packer for pay-TV company Consolidated Media Holdings fell through as the global financial crisis took hold. Another ill-fated foray with Packer was the creation of telecommunications company One.Tel during the dotcom boom. The pair lost A$1 billion when the company collapsed. As Packer started to exit the media business in favour of building a gaming empire, Lachlan paid A$1.50 per share to purchase a 9 percent stake from his friend in Ten Network Holdings Ltd in 2010. Shares in Ten, Australia’s third ranked commercial channel, are now at A$0.27, down 72 percent over the past three years, and it lost almost A$285 million last year. Lachlan is stepping down as non-executive chairman and from the board to avoid conflict with his News Corp roles. “He has never shown any particular innovation in journalism, but he is part of the family, isn’t he?” said Knight. Still, others say that Lachlan had proved himself as chairman of News Ltd before leaving the family firm. “He wasn’t backward in coming forward with his thoughts on what the paper was doing well and what it needed to improve,” David Penberthy, a former editor of Sydney’s Daily Telegraph, told local publication The Monthly last year. A source who worked with Lachlan in his media investments said it was widely understood that the potential heir wanted to prove himself without his father’s backing. Even though the Channel 10 investment failed financially, it allowed Lachlan to stretch his wings as he attempted to direct the upstart station into a more “grown-up” competitor for its established rivals, said the source, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the record. More successfully, Lachlan bought a 9 percent stake in regional free-to-air television company Prime Media Group Ltd  in 2009, selling it for a A$10 million profit in 2012. Also in 2009, he spent A$110 million buying half of DMG Radio Australia, owner of the Nova radio network, taking full ownership three years later. Under his chairmanship, Nova has become Australia’s No.1 radio network. News Corp said Lachlan would divide his time between New York and Sydney, allowing him to continue to develop his separate businesses. Lachlan, while London-born and U.S.-educated, is seen as the most “Australian” of Murdoch senior’s children. His English-born, Australia-raised model wife Sarah has starred as host of the local version of “Next Top Model”, while two of his three children were born in Sydney. As recently as last June, he told The Australian Financial Review when asked about the prospect of inheriting his 83-year-old father’s empire: “No. No, I’ve moved on from that.” Still, the signs were there that the door was not closed. He remained on the board during his years in the wilderness and had been seen as his father’s likely successor before he left. Among his siblings, he has arguably the most media experience and was untainted by the British phone hacking scandal that ensnared younger brother James. “For a billionaire media mogul with a supermodel wife, he’s actually a really down-to-earth guy,” said Joe Hildebrand, a columnist at the Daily Telegraph in Sydney. “He does just really love the media and is really passionate about it.”  ($1 = 1.0841 Australian Dollars)   (Additional reporting by Maggie Lu Yueyang; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)",3272014,http://www.reuters.com/article/twentyfirstcenturyfox-appointment-lachla/prodigal-son-returns-lachlan-murdoch-back-in-news-corp-idUSL4N0MO03G20140327

The deal could make Telecom Italia’s broadband offerings more attractive at a time when the phone group is carrying out costly network upgrades to boost Internet speeds and help it win customers in a recovering domestic market. “The Sky offer becomes the key element of Telecom Italia’s ultrabroadband strategy, and access to the new generation network allows Sky to benefit from an additional distribution platform for its programmes,” they said in a joint statement. Customers of Telecom Italia will be able to get all content of Sky Italia, which includes top-flight soccer and movies, at the same price without subscribing to a separate satellite package. Sky Italia currently sells pay-TV packages for a monthly fee starting at 24 euros ($33.20). For Sky Italia, the country’s biggest pay-TV operator and rival of Silvio Berlusconi’s Mediaset, the accord will expand its reach to more clients on top of those who already receive its programmes via a satellite dish. In the quarter to the end of December, SKY Italia maintained its subscriber base at 4.76 million. Such deals between telecom and cable operators and pay-TV players are common elsewhere in Europe. In France, Vivendi’s pay-TV unit Canal+ distributes 25 percent of its subscriptions via ADSL broadband in addition to satellites.

34,FOX,"UPDATE 2-Fox profit beats estimates on Super Bowl, cable growth","(Adds comment from Fox president on conference call) By Abhirup Roy and Liana B. Baker May 7 (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch-controlled television and film company 21st Century Fox Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by strong Super Bowl advertising and cable network growth. Excluding special items, the company earned 47 cents per share, handily beating the average Wall Street estimate of 35 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $8.22 billion from $7.35 billion. Shares in Fox, which separated from News Corp in June, rose 4 percent to $33.50 in extended trading on Wednesday. Chase Carey, Fox’s president and chief operating officer, hinted on a conference call with analysts that he was close to renewing his contract with Fox. Carey’s contract is up for renewal on June 30 and investors are wondering whether he will stay. At the end of March, Murdoch returned eldest son Lachlan to the leadership of his media empire and promoted younger son James, paving the way for the 83-year-old tycoon’s succession plan. James reports to Carey, who is a well respected operator. Carey said on the conference call on Wednesday, “Rupert and I have an understanding and a new agreement. We’ve simply not gotten it on paper yet.” Advertising revenue in Fox’s television business rose 30 percent in the quarter, helped by advertising during Super Bowl XLVIII and the National Football League playoffs. The Super Bowl is rotated yearly across different broadcast networks. “They overdelivered on television which Disney just missed out, so that was a good fact,” Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin said. Fox reported a 27 percent rise in TV revenue to $1.59 billion, while Disney on Tuesday blamed a decrease in primetime advertising for flat broadcast revenue of $1.50 billion. Revenue at Fox’s cable networks, its largest business, grew 11.5 percent to $3.15 billion, driven mainly by a 12 percent rise in domestic affiliate revenue. Fox’s stable of cable networks includes the Fox News Channel, Fox Sports, FX Networks, National Geographic channels and a new channel FXX aimed at young adults. Expenses rose 12 percent in the business as the company invests heavily on sports channels, going after Walt Disney Co’s  ESPN with its Fox Sports 1 channel launched in August. Net income was $1.05 billion, or 47 cents per share, for the third quarter ended March 31, compared to net income a year ago of $2.89 billion, or $1.22 per share. The prior-year period included a $2.1 billion accounting gain as the company increased its stake in British Sky Broadcasting.

35,FOX,News Corp profit beats expectations; newspaper ad sales still weak,"(Reuters) - News Corp (NWSA.O) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as a result of keeping costs in control even though its newspapers still suffered from declines in advertising revenue and subscriptions sales. For the quarter ending March, adjusted earnings per share was 11 cents, handily beating analysts’ forecasts of 3 cents. News Corp, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is the publisher of several newspapers including The Wall Street Journal and The Australian, the owner of book publisher HarperCollins, Australian pay-TV and digital real estate stakes and education company Amplify. The company also on Thursday named William Lewis, who had been filling the job on an interim basis, as chief executive officer of Dow Jones. Newspapers make up the bulk of the company’s business, and News Corp is not immune to the challenges besetting an industry hit by plunges in print advertising. Revenue at its news and information division, which represents more than 70 percent of its overall revenue, fell 9 percent on declines in ad and subscription sales. The company said that revenue at its Australian newspapers - the largest newspaper group at News Corp - dropped 21 percent partially related to foreign currency fluctuations. Stripping out divestitures and currency changes, News Corp said that total revenue was flat at $2.08 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting $2.06 billion. “It’s better than anticipated despite continued ad pressure in Australia and building out Amplify and issues at Dow Jones. They are still holding their own,” said Doug Arthur, an analyst with Evercore Research. News Corp shares were not affected in after-hours trading after closing flat at $17.11 on Thursday. News Corp made its biggest acquisition to date since it separated from its cable, TV and movie studio sister properties now known as 21st Century Fox Inc last year. Last week it agreed to pay $415 million for romance novel publisher Harlequin Enterprises Ltd with plans to use the company’s global distribution to help its publishing house HaperCollins sell more books across the globe. Net income fell to $48 million, or 8 cents per share, from $323 million, or 56 cents per share, in the same period last year which included a non-taxable gain on the Sky Network transaction.

Biogen Idec jumped 4.8 percent to $300.54 and TripAdvisor Inc rose 5.8 percent to $89.51. Twitter  gained 5.9 percent to $33.94 after news reports that brokerage SunTrust raised its rating on the stock to “buy.” These momentum shares have been wildly volatile in recent sessions after a sharp selloff that began in March on concerns about their high valuations. “I think it’s stabilizing a little bit for those stocks. Some would say they’re still overvalued, but they’ve come down enough that it doesn’t seem they have that much further to fall. Now people are trying to pick up bargains, and some of those stocks have been going up,” said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks climbed 2.4 percent, its biggest daily percentage gain since early March. At its session low Friday, the index was down exactly 10 percent from the intraday record high set in early March. A correction, which is a drop of 10 percent from a recent high, is often seen as a harbinger of more weakness. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF rose 2.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 112.13 points or 0.68 percent, to 16,695.47, a record closing high. The Dow also hit an intraday record high of 16,704.84. The S&P; 500 rose 18.17 points or 0.97 percent, to 1,896.65, also a record closing high. The Nasdaq Composite  climbed 71.99 points or 1.77 percent, to 4,143.859. The rally came despite a vote by pro-Russian rebels in favor of self-rule in eastern regions of the country in a referendum dismissed by Kiev and Western governments as illegal. The European Union is set to step up pressure on Russia by taking steps to extend sanctions to companies, as well as individuals. Hillshire Brands Co agreed to buy Pinnacle Foods Inc in a deal valued at about $6.6 billion, including debt. Pinnacle surged 13.2 percent to $34.47 while Hillshire fell 3.2 percent to $35.76. U.S.-listed shares of Indian companies and India-related exchange-traded funds also rose as exit polls in India predicted that the country’s main opposition party - viewed as more business friendly - would win general elections. Among ETFs, the Wisdom Tree India Earnings Fund gained 3.7 percent. In the latest development on deals in the healthcare sector, shares of U.S. drugmaker Allergan Inc dropped 1 percent to $159.72 after the company, known for Botox, its popular anti-wrinkle treatment, rejected Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s  takeover offer of $47 billion. Valeant’s U.S.-listed shares slipped 0.8 percent to $130.16. After the bell, shares of DirecTV rose 6.6 percent to $92.95 after a source said AT&T; Inc is in advanced talks to acquire the company. During the regular session, shares of 21st Century Fox  rose 3.1 percent to $35.19. Britain’s largest pay-TV company BSkyB is in talks to buy Sky Deutschland  and Sky Italia.

The 13-year-old “American Idol,” which has been dragging down Fox’s ratings, will start the season at two nights a week during the auditions phase, but “it’s quite likely it’ll end up being a two-hour show on one night through most of its run,” said Fox Broadcasting’ Entertainment Chairman Kevin Reilly on a Monday conference call about the new line-up.

41,FOX,Fox TV network chief to depart after ratings slump,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Kevin Reilly, the top executive at Fox broadcast television, is leaving the network next month, the company said on Thursday, after Fox slumped to last place in ratings among the big U.S. broadcasters. Reilly’s seven years as chairman of entertainment at Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) broadcast division ended with marquee programs like “American Idol” and “Glee” suffering sharp ratings drops. Fox has also lost its top ranking among viewers in the 18-49 age group that advertisers value most. Reilly said in a statement that he and Fox Networks Group chairman and chief executive officer, Peter Rice, had been discussing his departure for a while. “It felt like the timing was as right as it could be,” Reilly, who joined Fox in 2007 and was named chairman of entertainment in 2012, said in the statement. The move comes after the network presented its fall stable of programming to advertisers earlier this month. Fox said that Reilly’s senior executives will report to Rice before the company names a replacement.  The network averaged 7.3 million in daily primetime viewers this past season, according to Nielsen data. That was up from 7 million last year, but Fox fell one place to fourth behind, CBS, NBC and ABC, respectively.  Its record haul of 111.5 million viewers in February for football’s Super Bowl did not deliver a significant improvement on overall viewership. The Super Bowl also failed to boost the coveted 18-49 audience, which remained flat and in second place with 3.1 million viewers on average. Fox’s current entertainment slate consists of critically acclaimed shows such as “The Mindy Project,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” and “New Girl,” but the shows have so far been unable to become ratings powerhouses for the network. In addition to struggling with falling audiences for  “American Idol” and “Glee,” the network jettisoned Simon Cowell’s singing contest “The X Factor” in February after three seasons. Fox also canceled the anticipated science-fiction drama “Almost Human” from executive producer and “Star Trek” director J.J. Abrams after one season. Fox was the top draw in the 18-49 age group for eight consecutive years before it was knocked to second in the 2012-13 season. NBC, under the ownership of Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) has managed to make a big comeback and now is the top network in the 18-49 age group.   Reilly joined Fox from NBC, where he was the president of entertainment and oversaw the development of shows like hit comedies “The Office” and “30 Rock.” Reilly is also credited with helping usher in the current era of acclaimed and well-rated cable television from his time at Fox’s cable network FX where he introduced drama series such as “Nip/Tuck” and “The Shield.” ",5292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-television-fox/fox-tv-network-chief-to-depart-after-ratings-slump-idUSKBN0E920020140529

44,FOX,Fox shakes up television unit in bid to reverse ratings slip,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc on Monday announced a reorganization of its television business as the network sought to push itself out of last place among the big U.S. broadcasters. The company said Fox Broadcasting Company and 20th Century Fox Television will be housed under a new unit, Fox Television Group, bringing together its TV broadcasting and production units. The move comes almost two months after Fox’s top broadcast executive, Kevin Reilly, left from the network after it lost its top spot among viewers in the 18-49 age group that advertisers covet most. Marquee Fox programs like singing contest “American Idol” and musical series “Glee” have also suffered sharp ratings declines in recent years. Fox said Dana Walden and Gary Newman, both veterans at the network, will serve as co-chairmen and chief executive officers of the new Fox Television Group. Combining the network and studio in the same unit will lead to a more streamlined development process, Walden said during a media conference call. The structure is similar to the way competing broadcasters operate. “We want to make the development process smoother and more seamless” she said. “When a writer walks in the door with an idea, we will now be able to offer a singular point of view, which should offer tremendous reassurances to the talent.” The Fox studio will continue to produce shows for other networks, and the Fox broadcast network will air some series from other studios, the executives said. Fox currently produces Showtime drama “Homeland” and ABC comedy “Modern Family,” a perennial Emmy winner. The shakeup of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox’s TV units also comes a year after the film and TV company was spun off from Murdoch’s News Corp, which now operates publishing assets, including the Wall Street Journal. Fox averaged 7.3 million daily prime-time viewers during the 2013-14 season, according to Nielsen data. That was up from 7 million last year, but the network fell one place to fourth behind CBS, NBC and ABC, respectively.

Marquee Fox programs like singing contest “American Idol” and musical series “Glee” have also suffered sharp ratings declines in recent years. Fox said Dana Walden and Gary Newman, both veterans at the network, will serve as co-chairmen and chief executive officers of the new Fox Television Group. Combining the network and studio in the same unit will lead to a more streamlined development process, Walden said during a media conference call. The structure is similar to the way competing broadcasters operate. “We want to make the development process smoother and more seamless” she said. “When a writer walks in the door with an idea, we will now be able to offer a singular point of view, which should offer tremendous reassurances to the talent.” The Fox studio will continue to produce shows for other networks, and the Fox broadcast network will air some series from other studios, the executives said. Fox currently produces Showtime drama “Homeland” and ABC comedy “Modern Family,” a perennial Emmy winner. The shakeup of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox’s TV units also comes a year after the film and TV company was spun off from Murdoch’s News Corp, which now operates publishing assets, including the Wall Street Journal. Fox averaged 7.3 million daily prime-time viewers during the 2013-14 season, according to Nielsen data. That was up from 7 million last year, but the network fell one place to fourth behind CBS, NBC and ABC, respectively. Its entertainment lineup consists of acclaimed comedies such as “The Mindy Project” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” but those shows have yet to generate top-line ratings for the network.

46,FOX,Time Warner win would make Murdoch U.S. media king,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an audacious offer for Time Warner Inc that if it succeeds would transform the American media landscape and cement the 83-year-old’s status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment. While Time Warner, whose assets include the HBO cable channel and the Warner Bros movie studio, rejected the $80 billion bid, Murdoch is unlikely to abandon the pursuit and has the “disciplined determination” to get the deal done, people close to the situation said. Investors expect he will eventually raise the offer and increase the cash component – 40 percent - to win the prize. Murdoch’s proposal, fresh on the heels of his high-profile divorce and a damaging phone-hacking scandal that involved his British tabloids, is aggressively bold even for a media mogul whose ambitions are legendary.  A combined Fox-Time Warner would have a massive array of media and sports content and be in a very powerful negotiating position with cable and satellite distributors - some of whom have themselves announced mega-deals and newer ways of getting to consumers, such as online video distributors Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. “It’s a chance to put some great programming and content assets under one umbrella,” a person close to the situation said. “There are other alternatives, but none of them fit anywhere near as well as this does.”  Still, Time Warner pushed back strongly against Murdoch’s approach, insisting the offer undervalued the media conglomerate and raising fears about the dominating role that his family would play, another person close to the situation said on Wednesday.    In particular, the board is worried about the future value of Fox’s shares, which represented 60 percent of its cash-and-stock proposal. Those fears were magnified by a lack of voting rights, the source said, as that would concentrate too much power in the hands of Murdoch and his sons. “To do a merger of this scale and size where Time Warner shareholders have no insight into the destiny of the company is very troubling,” the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters.  Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes told the conglomerate’s employees in a videotaped appearance that the company’s standalone strategic plan would create value “superior to any proposal” that Fox could offer. The acquisition, if ever completed, would mark the second-largest media deal ever, when debt is included, trailing only Time Warner’s disastrous takeover of AOL in 2000.  In the end, a Time Warner deal is likely to hinge on price. The source pointed out that Fox’s stock has traded at the highest multiple of its peer group and Time Warner - prior to its 17 percent rally on Wednesday - was trading at the lowest. Time Warner worries that the stock - the main “currency” of the deal - may be ripe for a pullback, lowering the value that is currently on the table. According to StarMine SmartEstimates, Fox shares trade at a multiple of about 19.5 times 12-month forward earnings, above the group median of 17.8 and now in line with Time Warner’s 19.5 times - a valuation substantially above where the shares closed on Tuesday. Shares of Fox dropped 6.2 percent to $33. The offer, first reported by The New York Times, was worth  about $80 billion, or $85 a share, when it was made in June. Fox estimates that a combined company, which would have $60 billion in annual revenue, would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, the people familiar with the matter said.    Detailed negotiations with Time Warner could reveal even more potential savings, they said, which may then justify sweetening the offer. Fox said no talks were under way, and it has no desire to go hostile or to bid against itself with a higher offer, the people familiar with the matter said. Either way, a takeover by Fox could win the blessing of many of Time Warner’s shareholders, a majority of whom also own Fox’s non-voting stock. In addition, Time Warner does not have a staggered board and its bylaws allow as few as 15 percent of shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid. A number of Time Warner shareholders said Twenty-First Century Fox and Murdoch might have to raise the bid to as high as $95 per share from $85 when the bid was made in June to wrap up a merger. Murdoch also would do well to offer more cash upfront, investors said. Time Warner has no controlling shareholder, meaning the company could easily go into play, said Ken Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel LLC, which owns shares in both companies. “It’s going to be tough to say no,” he said during a conference in New York. Mario Gabelli, chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors, said he expects a technology company with more cash than Fox, such as Apple or Amazon, could emerge with a bid.  “It’s not a dynamic I want to dismiss out of hand. They have a currency, and they understand the value of content,” he said of the tech companies.” Gamco’s funds own about 3.6 million shares of Time Warner and about 10.5 million Fox shares.                   Fox’s overtures are likely to reverberate across the industry, accelerating a wave of consolidation that is already well underway.  Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable provider, offered in February to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion in stock. Overseas, Fox’s 39 percent-owned British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc is negotiating to buy Fox’s Sky Italia and its Sky Deutschland subsidiary in a deal that could net Fox as much as $13 billion. As a consequence of the Murdoch bid, “the urgency to find a dance partner will increase across the sector,” said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger.  U.S. media shares closed higher on the deal, with top gainers including Discovery Communications Inc, up 6.3 percent; Viacom Inc, which rose 3.3 percent; and AMC Networks Inc, ending 4.5 percent higher. Murdoch started thinking about a potential merger with Time Warner as he was separating Twenty-First Century Fox, which mostly consists of media properties, from News Corp, focused on the Wall Street Journal and other publishing assets, people familiar with the company said.  The separation, triggered by the British phone-hacking scandal which dragged Murdoch before the British parliament, has in the end positioned Fox to become a powerful consolidator of media properties, people familiar with the matter said.  Fox has indicated it would sell Time Warner’s CNN cable channel, a direct competitor of Fox News, to clear any regulatory hurdles, according to the people. At least one antitrust expert, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said it was unlikely that any issues that arise would kill a Fox deal for Time Warner. The source pointed out that there were five major content companies in the United States, plus numerous smaller ones. News of the Time Warner bid comes as Fox is reorganizing its television business, aiming to lift its network out of last place among the big U.S. broadcasters.

55,FOX,"UPDATE 3-Time Warner rebuffs Fox bid, but Murdoch determined","* Bid worth about $80 billion -sources * Murdoch may consider higher offer for Time Warner -sources * Time Warner shares up 17.3 percent   (Changes throughout with sourcing, company background) By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc said on Wednesday it had offered to buy Time Warner Inc, a move that would unite two of the world’s most powerful media conglomerates, but Time Warner rebuffed its offer. Time Warner’s stock jumped 17.3 percent to $83.33 on the New York Stock Exchange after news that Murdoch had his sights on Time Warner, the owner of the Warner Bros. movie studio and cable channels such as HBO and CNN, among other media properties. Murdoch’s cash-and-stock bid was worth about $80 billion, or $85 per share, people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Wednesday. The offer, first reported by The New York Times, consisted of 60 percent in stock and the rest in cash. Twenty-First Century Fox later confirmed it had made a formal takeover proposal in June but said there were no talks currently under way. Even so, Murdoch and his advisers are unlikely to abandon his ambition to put Time Warner in his empire so easily, one of the people said, pointing out that he has the “disciplined determination” to get a deal done. Fox’s overtures to Time Warner could accelerate a wave of consolidation that is already reshaping the U.S. media landscape. Reuters reported this month that Murdoch was in the midst of a deal that would give Fox the firepower to buy a content company. Fox, which owns cable news channel Fox News as well as movie studio 20th Century Fox, has indicated it would sell CNN as part of its proposal to buy Time Warner to clear any regulatory hurdles, according to the people familiar with the matter. “(It) would be good deal for Fox if it goes through Washington (regulators) with CNN sales,” Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan told Reuters in an email. He said the “fair public value” for Time Warner was $82 a share. Fox currently estimates that a combined company would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, primarily by cutting sales staff and back-office functions, the people familiar with the matter said. It believes that detailed negotiations with Time Warner could reveal much higher synergies than $1 billion, which may justify Fox sweetening its offer, the people said. The combined company’s revenue would be more than $60 billion. Twenty-First Century Fox is in the middle of a reorganization of its television business as the network seeks to lift itself out of last place among the big U.S. broadcasters.

56,FOX,Time Warner win would make Murdoch U.S. media king,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an audacious offer for Time Warner Inc that if it succeeds would transform the American media landscape and cement the 83-year-old’s status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment. While Time Warner, whose assets include the HBO cable channel and the Warner Bros movie studio, rejected the $80 billion bid, Murdoch is unlikely to abandon the pursuit and has the “disciplined determination” to get the deal done, people close to the situation said. Investors expect he will eventually raise the offer and increase the cash component – 40 percent - to win the prize. Murdoch’s proposal, fresh on the heels of his high-profile divorce and a damaging phone-hacking scandal that involved his British tabloids, is aggressively bold even for a media mogul whose ambitions are legendary.  A combined Fox-Time Warner would have a massive array of media and sports content and be in a very powerful negotiating position with cable and satellite distributors - some of whom have themselves announced mega-deals and newer ways of getting to consumers, such as online video distributors Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. “It’s a chance to put some great programming and content assets under one umbrella,” a person close to the situation said. “There are other alternatives, but none of them fit anywhere near as well as this does.”  Still, Time Warner pushed back strongly against Murdoch’s approach, insisting the offer undervalued the media conglomerate and raising fears about the dominating role that his family would play, another person close to the situation said on Wednesday.     In particular, the board is worried about the future value of Fox’s shares, which represented 60 percent of its cash-and-stock proposal. Those fears were magnified by a lack of voting rights, the source said, as that would concentrate too much power in the hands of Murdoch and his sons. “To do a merger of this scale and size where Time Warner shareholders have no insight into the destiny of the company is very troubling,” the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters.  Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes told the conglomerate’s employees in a videotaped appearance that the company’s standalone strategic plan would create value “superior to any proposal” that Fox could offer. The acquisition, if ever completed, would mark the second-largest media deal ever, when debt is included, trailing only the disasterous takeover of Time Warner by AOL in 2000.  In the end, a Time Warner deal is likely to hinge on price. The source pointed out that Fox’s stock has traded at the highest multiple of its peer group and Time Warner - prior to its 17 percent rally on Wednesday - was trading at the lowest. Time Warner worries that the stock - the main “currency” of the deal - may be ripe for a pullback, lowering the value that is currently on the table. According to StarMine SmartEstimates, Fox shares trade at a multiple of about 19.5 times 12-month forward earnings, above the group median of 17.8 and now in line with Time Warner’s 19.5 times - a valuation substantially above where the shares closed on Tuesday. Shares of Fox dropped 6.2 percent to $33. The offer, first reported by The New York Times, was worth  about $80 billion, or $85 a share, when it was made in June. Fox estimates that a combined company, which would have $60 billion in annual revenue, would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, the people familiar with the matter said.    Detailed negotiations with Time Warner could reveal even more potential savings, they said, which may then justify sweetening the offer. Fox said no talks were under way, and it has no desire to go hostile or to bid against itself with a higher offer, the people familiar with the matter said. Either way, a takeover by Fox could win the blessing of many of Time Warner’s shareholders, a majority of whom also own Fox’s non-voting stock. In addition, Time Warner does not have a staggered board and its bylaws allow as few as 15 percent of shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid. A number of Time Warner shareholders said Twenty-First Century Fox and Murdoch might have to raise the bid to as high as $95 per share from $85 when the bid was made in June to wrap up a merger. Murdoch also would do well to offer more cash upfront, investors said. Time Warner has no controlling shareholder, meaning the company could easily go into play, said Ken Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel LLC, which owns shares in both companies. “It’s going to be tough to say no,” he said during a conference in New York. Mario Gabelli, chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors, said he expects a technology company with more cash than Fox, such as Apple or Amazon, could emerge with a bid.  “It’s not a dynamic I want to dismiss out of hand. They have a currency, and they understand the value of content,” he said of the tech companies.” Gamco’s funds own about 3.6 million shares of Time Warner and about 10.5 million Fox shares.        Fox’s overtures are likely to reverberate across the industry, accelerating a wave of consolidation that is already well underway.  Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable provider, offered in February to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion in stock. Overseas, Fox’s 39 percent-owned British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc is negotiating to buy Fox’s Sky Italia and its Sky Deutschland subsidiary in a deal that could net Fox as much as $13 billion. As a consequence of the Murdoch bid, “the urgency to find a dance partner will increase across the sector,” said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger.  U.S. media shares closed higher on the deal, with top gainers including Discovery Communications Inc, up 6.3 percent; Viacom Inc, which rose 3.3 percent; and AMC Networks Inc, ending 4.5 percent higher. Murdoch started thinking about a potential merger with Time Warner as he was separating Twenty-First Century Fox, which mostly consists of media properties, from News Corp, focused on the Wall Street Journal and other publishing assets, people familiar with the company said.  The separation, triggered by the British phone-hacking scandal which dragged Murdoch before the British parliament, has in the end positioned Fox to become a powerful consolidator of media properties, people familiar with the matter said.  Fox has indicated it would sell Time Warner’s CNN cable channel, a direct competitor of Fox News, to clear any regulatory hurdles, according to the people. At least one antitrust expert, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said it was unlikely that any issues that arise would kill a Fox deal for Time Warner. The source pointed out that there were five major content companies in the United States, plus numerous smaller ones. News of the Time Warner bid comes as Fox is reorganizing its television business, aiming to lift its network out of last place among the big U.S. broadcasters.

58,FOX,Fox-Time Warner deal could bring the game to ESPN,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox’s plan to buy Time Warner could create an upheaval in the sports television world, creating the first meaningful challenge to Walt Disney Co’s ESPN. Time Warner’s board has rejected an $80 billion bid, but Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch is unlikely to walk away quickly. A deal would bring him college basketball’s “March Madness” championship tournament, prime time National Basketball Association (NBA) games, and Major League Baseball (MLB) games. Fox’s sports rights include National Football League games, professional baseball games and NASCAR racing. In 2015 it gets the rights to women’s World Cup soccer and in 2018 the men’s World Cup. Disney’s ESPN, with Monday Night Football, Major League Baseball games, NBA games and college football, will still be the team to beat, but for once there might be a match.  “You start to put it all together and you create a significant competitor to ESPN for ratings and advertising dollars,” said Marc Ganis, a sports TV consultant.  In an age of DVRs and on demand viewing, sports stands out for its ability to draw television audiences which are large and watch live, two traits crucial for selling advertising, says Ed Desser, a former president of NBA Television and New Media Ventures, who advises teams and league’s on their TV contracts. “It’s TV’s growth engine,” he says. “It drives subscriber fees and keeps people watching.” Ganis speculates that some key Time Warner sports, such as its professional basketball doubleheaders, could move from TNT to Fox Sports 1. Fox Sports 1 already airs major league baseball, motor sports, mixed marital arts and college football and basketball games from the larger conferences. The additions could allow Fox Sports 1, now in about 90 million homes, to add subscribers and raise the affiliate fees from cable and satellite operators that make up the majority of its revenues. ESPN is in more than 100 million homes, not too far ahead of Fox. However, ESPN currently can charge cable companies $6.04 per month for each subscriber, according to data compiled by consultant SNL Kagan.  By comparison, Fox Sports 1 is paid 68 cents for each of its subscribers. Thanks in part to its National Basketball Association games, TNT gets $1.48 per subscriber.  Murdoch could also use Time Warner’s collection of channels to outbid competitors for key sporting events, spreading the costs among its Fox network and cable channels, said Derek Baine, Research Director at SNL Kagan. “One of the things driving this deal is that Fox will be more aggressively bidding on sports rights, so this will give them more fire power,” Baine said in an email. “Like NBCU with the Olympics, they can spread games across multiple networks.” Combining the two would also eliminate a major buyer of sports programming, which may raise concerns at the U.S. Justice Department when it reviews a deal, said Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School. Carstensen says the review may focus on specific parts of the content business — movies, sports, news — rather than a new company’s entire offering of content. “My guess is that enforcers are less likely to be concerned by the overall programming,” he said. “If you’re not going to take the general market view, you may have to divest some sports programming.” Fox also will have to convince sports leagues or conferences to alter existing contracts to shift around the sports, said Desser. Contracts usually tightly prescribe where games can be shown, and leagues are loath to change them for fear of upsetting other TV rights holders. Fox already airs NBA games on many of its 22 regional sports cable channels, he says. “But anything is possible, and deals get rewritten,” he said. “Sports are such a pure growth engine that they may try.” ",7172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-timewarner-fox-sports-analysis/fox-time-warner-deal-could-bring-the-game-to-espn-idUSKBN0FM09820140717
59,FOX,"Time Warner investors want higher bid, bigger cash ratio from Murdoch","BOSTON (Reuters) - To clinch a deal to buy Time Warner Inc, Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc will not only need to raise the value of its bid above $80 billion but also boost its ratio of cash to stock, investors said on Wednesday. Time Warner said it rejected Murdoch’s unsolicited offer, of which 60 percent would be Twenty-First Century Fox stock and 40 percent cash, a far-reaching proposal that would reshape the media landscape. A number of Time Warner shareholders said Fox and Murdoch, its Chairman and Chief Executive, may have to raise the bid to as much as $95 a share and boost its cash component to wrap up a merger. Murdoch offered about $85 a share when the bid was made in June. “Rupert has got to figure out a way to get more cash in the deal,” said Mario Gabelli, Chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors.  Gamco’s funds own about 3.6 million shares of Time Warner. Like many other shareholders, Gamco also owns stock in Murdoch’s company — about 10.5 million shares — and Gabelli said some of his own investors are not eager to increase the number of those shares as part of a merger. Another executive at one of Time Warner’s large institutional shareholders also said he would look for Murdoch to offer a higher ratio of cash to firm up the value of the deal. Prospects for gains in Fox stock in the near term could be constrained by the difficulties of merging the two businesses, including wringing out cost savings, and the effect of the likely debt burden Fox assume after borrowing billions of dollars. “Cash is cash, so you know exactly what the value is,” this person said. Even though this executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of company policy, said he thought the overall value of the proposed deal was fair, Murdoch can still raise his bid. “It’s a corporate poker game for sure, and Murdoch never plays his best card first. There’s always another card left to be played,” this person said. Time Warner shares rose 17 percent to $83.13 in trading on Wednesday after the company disclosed the offer and its rejection. Including the assumption of Time Warner debt, the deal would have been worth $94.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Twenty-First Century Fox shares fell 6 percent to $33.     Time Warner said the strength of its own strategy and “significant risk and uncertainty as to the valuation” of Fox’s stock were reasons for rejecting the bid. It also noted the stock did not have voting rights, a type of share that typically trades at a discount. A Time Warner spokesman declined further comment. A spokesman for Twenty-First Century Fox declined to comment. Mitch Zacks, portfolio manager and principal of Zacks Investment Management of Chicago, said Time Warner’s board may have rejected the offer as a bargaining tactic. “My guess is that if the offer goes to about $95 per share, the board would have a hard time turning it down,” he said. Zacks declined to discuss exactly what price he would accept to sell his own shares. He said his firm has about 192,000 Time Warner shares and none of 21st Century Fox. Zacks also noted low interest rates make it easy for companies to finance borrowing but that stock prices are at all-time highs, creating currency for deals and helping drive an M&A; boom. A high stock price could be tempting Murdoch’s company to prefer stock than cash as its currency. Shawn Narancich, executive vice president at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, said with Wednesday’s price run-up, Time Warner now trades in line with some competitors, about 20 times estimated 2014 earnings.  Time Warner’s growth projections could justify its rejection of the original offer, Narancich said. As a shareholder he said he would likely sell Time Warner shares if Fox or another buyer offered $90 to $95 a share. “At those levels, it becomes harder for Time Warner to argue the merits of continuing to remain independent,” Narancich said.

61,FOX,Murdoch's tenacity is the trade in Time Warner-Fox face-off,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many investors say the best trading strategy around a potential takeover of Time Warner Inc by Twenty-First Century Fox is to wager that media baron Rupert Murdoch will pay up to get what he wants. The trick is that it may be too late to place the obvious bets. Time Warner said on Wednesday it had rebuffed Twenty-First Century Fox’s roughly $80 billion bid, or $85 per share, in recent weeks over valuation and concerns that the Murdoch family will have too much power. But people familiar with Twenty-First Century Fox said Murdoch is determined to buy the rival media giant. Hedge fund traders and options strategists said the traditional merger arbitrage trade - short Twenty-First Century Fox and buy Time Warner - played out when the news broke. Arbitrageurs seek to profit on the difference in stock prices between an acquirer and the target. In a deal that involves the swap of stock, that generally involves buying the target’s shares and betting the acquirer’s will fall. Murdoch made a stock and cash offer for Time Warner. But these traders said that the time for that bet may have passed. Time Warner’s stock has risen 21 percent to $86.12, since the news broke. Twenty-First Century Fox has fallen nearly 7 percent. “Fox shares will spike higher if this deal is killed or if Time Warner bids for something,” making a defensive acquisition, one arbitrageur said. “Time Warner will also remain range-bound, unless there is a higher bid or it does something that destroys the process, or something to buy another company.” So investors who missed that window must now make bolder bets if they still want in on the trade.   Sources have said that Twenty-First Century Fox could see more than $1 billion in synergies from a deal. One hedge fund manager said in his reckoning synergies from the deal could be as high as $1.5 billion, which would allow Twenty-First Century Fox to pay as much as $95 per share to $100 per share and still have a deal be substantially accretive to 2016 earnings.  The hedge fund manager said many arbitrageurs are remaining long in shares of Time Warner, given Murdoch’s reputation as a tenacious dealmaker. Murdoch, for example, overcame stiff resistance from some members of the Bancroft family to buy Dow Jones in 2007. But he did not raise his bid at the time.  “The key right now for me is, ‘What is my downside?’” said one hedge fund trader. “The price on the table is not the right price. It’s not going to get it done.” The trader said he owns a relatively small position in Time Warner and is evaluating how — and whether — to place a bigger bet. One way to put less money on the line while betting that Twenty-First Century Fox will raise its bid is to buy Time Warner stock options. Activity in the options market already shows investors are optimistic that either a bidding war could occur or Murdoch could end up raising his initial offer.  There was substantial activity in Time Warner call options expiring in mid-August with a $90 strike price - bullish bets that the stock will hit that level by that expiration.  “For you to buy an August $90, you have to believe there’s a higher bid in the next month here or an increased bid by him,” said William Lefkowitz, chief options strategist at vFinance Investments. There were also notable new positions taken in call options expiring in mid-October at the $95 and $100 strike prices, which also suggests a belief that shares will keep rising. Nearly 2,000 new contracts were purchased at the $100 strike price for October, according to Thomson Reuters data. But the bid-ask spread in August options contracts is at a very wide range – between 40 and 60 cents for a number of contracts. That makes it more expensive to make such a bet. The better bet may be in the stock market, which has tighter spreads.  Arbitrageurs will usually play in the market with tighter spreads because of efficiency, said J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.  There are few other options at the moment to arbitrage this deal, traders said. In a sign that investors think Fox shares have fallen as much as they will, short interest is muted. As of Wednesday, short interest in Twenty-First Century Fox was around 2.8 percent of the outstanding shares, a relatively low amount, according to data firm Markit.  The credit default swaps market, another avenue to hedge or bet on the trade, may not work out either, one arbitrageur said.  “These names are great credits, so even if Fox levers up to do a deal, it won’t widen much. I doubt there’s much to be done in CDS on this one,” the arbitrageur said.  Twenty-First Century Fox’s 5-year CDS price jumped about 20 percent Wednesday to their highest since February, but they moved no further on Thursday and remain relatively low. Time Warner’s dropped nearly 6 percent. ",7182014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-fox-trading/murdochs-tenacity-is-the-trade-in-time-warner-fox-face-off-idUSKBN0FN0C220140718

Time Warner said on Wednesday it had rebuffed Twenty-First Century Fox’s roughly $80 billion bid, or $85 per share, in recent weeks over valuation and concerns that the Murdoch family will have too much power. But people familiar with Twenty-First Century Fox said Murdoch is determined to buy the rival media giant. Hedge fund traders and options strategists said the traditional merger arbitrage trade - short Twenty-First Century Fox and buy Time Warner - played out when the news broke. Arbitrageurs seek to profit on the difference in stock prices between an acquirer and the target. In a deal that involves the swap of stock, that generally involves buying the target’s shares and betting the acquirer’s will fall. Murdoch made a stock and cash offer for Time Warner. But these traders said that the time for that bet may have passed. Time Warner’s stock has risen 21 percent to $86.12, since the news broke. Twenty-First Century Fox has fallen nearly 7 percent. “Fox shares will spike higher if this deal is killed or if Time Warner bids for something,” making a defensive acquisition, one arbitrageur said. “Time Warner will also remain range-bound, unless there is a higher bid or it does something that destroys the process, or something to buy another company.” So investors who missed that window must now make bolder bets if they still want in on the trade. Sources have said that Twenty-First Century Fox could see more than $1 billion in synergies from a deal. One hedge fund manager said in his reckoning synergies from the deal could be as high as $1.5 billion, which would allow Twenty-First Century Fox to pay as much as $95 per share to $100 per share and still have a deal be substantially accretive to 2016 earnings. The hedge fund manager said many arbitrageurs are remaining long in shares of Time Warner, given Murdoch’s reputation as a tenacious dealmaker. Murdoch, for example, overcame stiff resistance from some members of the Bancroft family to buy Dow Jones in 2007. But he did not raise his bid at the time. “The key right now for me is, ‘What is my downside?’” said one hedge fund trader. “The price on the table is not the right price. It’s not going to get it done.” The trader said he owns a relatively small position in Time Warner and is evaluating how — and whether — to place a bigger bet. One way to put less money on the line while betting that Twenty-First Century Fox will raise its bid is to buy Time Warner stock options. Activity in the options market already shows investors are optimistic that either a bidding war could occur or Murdoch could end up raising his initial offer. There was substantial activity in Time Warner call options expiring in mid-August with a $90 strike price - bullish bets that the stock will hit that level by that expiration. “For you to buy an August $90, you have to believe there’s a higher bid in the next month here or an increased bid by him,” said William Lefkowitz, chief options strategist at vFinance Investments. There were also notable new positions taken in call options expiring in mid-October at the $95 and $100 strike prices, which also suggests a belief that shares will keep rising. Nearly 2,000 new contracts were purchased at the $100 strike price for October, according to Thomson Reuters data. But the bid-ask spread in August options contracts is at a very wide range - between 40 and 60 cents for a number of contracts. That makes it more expensive to make such a bet. The better bet may be in the stock market, which has tighter spreads. Arbitrageurs will usually play in the market with tighter spreads because of efficiency, said J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. There are few other options at the moment to arbitrage this deal, traders said. In a sign that investors think Fox shares have fallen as much as they will, short interest is muted. As of Wednesday, short interest in Twenty-First Century Fox was around 2.8 percent of the outstanding shares, a relatively low amount, according to data firm Markit. The credit default swaps market, another avenue to hedge or bet on the trade, may not work out either, one arbitrageur said. “These names are great credits, so even if Fox levers up to do a deal, it won’t widen much. I doubt there’s much to be done in CDS on this one,” the arbitrageur said. Twenty-First Century Fox’s 5-year CDS price jumped about 20 percent Wednesday to their highest since February, but they moved no further on Thursday and remain relatively low. Time Warner’s dropped nearly 6 percent.

65,FOX,Time Warner moves to bar shareholders from calling meetings,"(Reuters) - Time Warner Inc’s board moved to prevent its shareholders from calling special meetings, effectively throwing up a hurdle to any quick move to approve a potential takeover by Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox.   Fox made an offer for Time Warner for about $80 billion or about $85 per share in a mix of stock and cash that Time Warner rebuffed, both companies disclosed last week.  Time Warner previously allowed as few as 15 percent of its shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid. The move, revealed in a regulatory filing on Monday, was not preempted by any particular investor buying large amounts of Time Warner shares but rather to give the board the ability to defend itself from an unsolicited bid, two sources close to the matter said. The sources said the board believed the move was in the best interests of all its shareholders. “When you are facing a hostile bid, you don’t want to give the bidder the ability to artificially preempt that process,” one of the sources said.  The amended bylaw is temporary, however, as the board said it plans to reinstate the special meeting provision during its 2015 annual meeting, according to the filing.     Similar moves have been taken by other takeover targets in recent years, including Airgas Inc, which eventually implemented a poison pill that blocked a $5.9 billion hostile bid from Air Products and Chemicals Inc. The sources, who declined to identified because the discussions are private, would not speculate whether Time Warner’s board would also put a poison pill in place.     A spokesman for Time Warner, which owns cable networks TNT and CNN, pay-TV channel HBO and Warner Bros movie studio, declined to comment. Time Warner Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes told his employees in video that the company’s standalone strategic plan would create value “superior to any proposal” that Fox could offer. Part of the issue involves the mix of cash and stock and lack of control of Time Warner’s shareholders if a deal should go through, sources told Reuters last week.  Murdoch controls Fox through a 39 percent stake in special shares that were not part of the offer. Fox offered 60 percent in common stock and 40 percent cash. Several Time Warner shareholders told Reuters last week that Fox may have to raise the bid to as much as $95 a share boosting its cash component to seal a merger.

70,FOX,Fitch: FOX CDS Widen 50% on Potential Time Warner Combo,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 24 (Fitch) Significant widening in Twenty-First Century Fox,  Inc.'s (FOX) five-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads is likely in reaction  to news that the media giant had made an offer to buy Time Warner Inc.,  according to Fitch Solutions.  CDS on FOX have widened 50% since July 4, compared to just 3% widening observed  for Fitch Solutions' North America Media CDS Index over the same time period.   Additionally, CDS liquidity for FOX has increased notably over the past few  weeks, and is currently trading in the 15th regional percentile, up nine  rankings since July 8. Increased CDS liquidity reflects higher levels of market  uncertainty over the future direction of spreads for the media giant.  Time Warner has reportedly turned down an $80 billion acquisition offer from  FOX. The offer was at about a 25% premium of the stock price a day prior. If  formed, the combined company would be valued at roughly $150 billion and would  form one of the largest media firms globally.  We believe the deal makes strategic sense for both companies. FOX would benefit  from the acquisition by adding more leverage in deal-making with cable  companies, expand its rights to broadcast sporting events, while Time Warner  would add to its already impressive Hollywood studio. Rating concerns for Time Warner, apart from M&A; activity, center on the  company's ability to balance escalating programming expenses and production  costs with the requirement to consistently deliver programming that drives  incremental viewer share while maintaining or expanding operating margins. Time  Warner's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BBB+' and the Rating Outlook is Stable.  For FOX, exposure to cyclical advertising revenues within the company's local  television and Fox Network ad sales highlights rating concerns, as does the  company's capacity to adapt to ever-changing media consumption patterns and  technology platforms. FOX's IDR is currently 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook.

71,FOX,Analysis: Carey pressured from both sides of Fox Time Warner deal to stay in job,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chase Carey, Twenty-First Century Fox’s president and chief operating officer, may be feeling pressure to stay in his job for several more years both from his boss, Rupert Murdoch, and from the company Murdoch is trying to buy, Time Warner Inc. As Murdoch mulls his next step following Time Warner’s rejection of his $80 billion offer, some Time Warner investors say they are concerned about who might succeed the 83-year-old chairman and chief executive. In particular, they’re not sure whether Murdoch’s sons, James, 41, and Lachlan, 42, are ready to manage the integration challenge. That’s where Carey comes in. The 60-year-old New Yorker, who’s been working for Murdoch since 1988 and earned a reputation for a no-nonsense leadership style, signed a two-year contract with Fox in June that gives him the option to opt out after 18 months. That’s raised concern that two years won’t be long enough given the complexity of the deal and the likelihood that it may not close until the end of 2015, if not later. “There is a big push for Carey to stick around to handle the transition if not beyond,” said one person familiar with Fox’s thinking. “There’s no way that after working for 30 years for Rupert and he gets his crowning deal that Carey would bail on him.” The succession issue is important to Time Warner shareholders not only because of concerns about the experience of Murdoch’s sons but also because the way the bid was structured, Time Warner shareholders would have no voting shares: Murdoch controls Fox through a special class of voting stock that is not part of the deal. The deal would be less risky for Time Warner shareholders if Carey were still in the job, said one person familiar with Time Warner. Fox spokesman Nathaniel Brown declined to comment. Time Warner spokesman Keith Cocozza also declined to comment. Carey didn’t respond to a request for comment. “The reasons people like Carey is he is decisive, he doesn’t use words to create obfuscation, he is very direct and extraordinarily candid for a senior executive,” said Larry Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gabelli with stakes in Fox and Time Warner. “If I had to pick between James and Chase I would pick Chase,” Haverty said, if the merger happens. On July 16 Time Warner said it rebuffed an $80 billion bid from Fox, including about $85 per share in cash and non-voting stock. The Murdoch family, including James, is so behind Carey that during the contract negotiations Carey was asked to stay three years, according to two people familiar with the talks. One of those sources said that Carey and James have become close and that James is among his strongest supporters. In March, Murdoch elevated James to co-chief operating officer with Carey. Lachlan returned to the fold after nearly ten years to become non-executive co-chairman of both Fox and News Corp, the publishing assets that were cleaved off from the entertainment division in a corporate split last year. Investors in both companies view Carey as well equipped to handle the job of combining and managing an entertainment and news colossus that would alter the media landscape. A merger would bring under single management the major movie studios Warner Bros and Twentieth Century Fox, a vast array of broadcast and cable networks that includes Turner Broadcasting System and Fox News, and HBO, one of the most successful pay-TV channels.  “You are dealing with the necessity to manage globally an enormously (big) empire. I think Chase has done that with a company half the size where James has proved he has led a single business,” Haverty said, noting that James did an “outstanding job” as CEO of British pay-TV provider BSkyB, which is 39-percent owned by Fox.  “I think James is eventually going to have enough background to move into Chase’s shoes and my guess is he will do very well with that,” said Haverty. Time Warner’s board is concerned that the Fox deal will leave its shareholders with no say in the future company, sources familiar with Time Warner told Reuters last week. Time Warner has one class of stock. A merger could be a good leverage point to reshape the leadership. “I do think the big deal here ... is the management and the voting control,” said Matthew Benkendorf, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management, which owns about 5.5 million non-voting Fox shares.   “This is a good chance for everyone to start thinking about this generational change going on.” Carey has been one of Murdoch’s most loyal lieutenants. During the height of the phone hacking scandal three years ago at Murdoch’s British newspapers, the media mogul once went as far as acknowledging that Carey would replace him as CEO if he suddenly “went under a bus.”  Carey joined what was then News Corp in 1988 serving in a variety of roles including a consulting stint and chief executive of DirecTV when Murdoch controlled the satellite operator. Carey stayed with DirecTV after Murdoch sold his stake to Liberty Media’s John Malone but not for long: he quickly went back work for Murdoch after Peter Chernin, president and COO exited News Corp in 2009.  “You’ve got Chase Carey... he’s very strong across the board,” said Jason Subotky, partner and portfolio manager at Yacktman Asset Management one of Fox’s largest common shareholders. “He’s very disciplined, he’s a good operator and a good negotiator. He has experience on both sides of the business, both in content and distribution.”  ",7242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-timewarner-fox-carey/analysis-carey-pressured-from-both-sides-of-fox-time-warner-deal-to-stay-in-job-idUSKBN0FT1ZS20140724
72,FOX,Carey pressured from both sides of Fox Time Warner deal to stay in job,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chase Carey, Twenty-First Century Fox’s president and chief operating officer, may be feeling pressure to stay in his job for several more years both from his boss, Rupert Murdoch, and from the company Murdoch is trying to buy, Time Warner Inc. As Murdoch mulls his next step following Time Warner’s rejection of his $80 billion offer, some Time Warner investors say they are concerned about who might succeed the 83-year-old chairman and chief executive. In particular, they’re not sure whether Murdoch’s sons, James, 41, and Lachlan, 42, are ready to manage the integration challenge. That’s where Carey comes in. The 60-year-old New Yorker, who’s been working for Murdoch since 1988 and earned a reputation for a no-nonsense leadership style, signed a two-year contract with Fox in June that gives him the option to opt out after 18 months. That’s raised concern that two years won’t be long enough given the complexity of the deal and the likelihood that it may not close until the end of 2015, if not later. “There is a big push for Carey to stick around to handle the transition if not beyond,” said one person familiar with Fox’s thinking. “There’s no way that after working for 30 years for Rupert and he gets his crowning deal that Carey would bail on him.” The succession issue is important to Time Warner shareholders not only because of concerns about the experience of Murdoch’s sons but also because the way the bid was structured, Time Warner shareholders would have no voting shares: Murdoch controls Fox through a special class of voting stock that is not part of the deal. The deal would be less risky for Time Warner shareholders if Carey were still in the job, said one person familiar with Time Warner. Fox spokesman Nathaniel Brown declined to comment. Time Warner spokesman Keith Cocozza also declined to comment. Carey didn’t respond to a request for comment. “The reasons people like Carey is he is decisive, he doesn’t use words to create obfuscation, he is very direct and extraordinarily candid for a senior executive,” said Larry Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gabelli with stakes in Fox and Time Warner. “If I had to pick between James and Chase I would pick Chase,” Haverty said, if the merger happens. On July 16 Time Warner said it rebuffed an $80 billion bid from Fox, including about $85 per share in cash and non-voting stock. The Murdoch family, including James, is so behind Carey that during the contract negotiations Carey was asked to stay three years, according to two people familiar with the talks. One of those sources said that Carey and James have become close and that James is among his strongest supporters. In March, Murdoch elevated James to co-chief operating officer with Carey. Lachlan returned to the fold after nearly ten years to become non-executive co-chairman of both Fox and News Corp, the publishing assets that were cleaved off from the entertainment division in a corporate split last year. Investors in both companies view Carey as well equipped to handle the job of combining and managing an entertainment and news colossus that would alter the media landscape.

73,FOX,Fitch: FOX Asset Sales Enhance Financial Flexibility in Pursuit of Time Warner,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.'s  (FOXA) decision to transfer its European direct broadcast satellite businesses  to British Sky Broadcasting Group plc (BSkyB) in a transaction valued at  approximately $9.3 billion improves the company's liquidity position and overall  financial flexibility.  Consideration for the exchange consists of $8.6 billion  of cash and BSkyB's 21% interest in National Geographic Channels International  and will generate approximately $7.2 billion of net cash proceeds. The  transaction is in line with the company's objective to streamline its  organizational structure. FOXA also announced a renewed share repurchase authorization that will be  executed during the company's fiscal year 2015. Shareholder returns that exceed  FCF generation are incorporated into FOXA's current ratings provided that  leverage remains below Fitch's 3.0x leverage threshold for FOXA's current 'BBB+'  rating. From Fitch's perspective FOXA has the necessary financial flexibility, primarily  through monetization of non-core assets, including the transaction announced  today, along with expected free cash flow (FCF) generation, to maintain strong  'BBB' ratings should the company elect to continue pursuing an acquisition of  Time Warner, Inc. (TWX). Time Warner previously rejected FOXA's unsolicited bid  of $85 per share consisting of 1.531 FOXA non-voting common stock and $32.42 in  cash per Time Warner share.   Should a transaction between FOXA and Time Warner materialize, Fitch will have a  level of tolerance within the existing rating level should the combined company  initially operate outside the parameters of the 'BBB+' rating, provided a  creditable de-leveraging plan is in place that reduces leverage to a level more  reflective of the rating within Fitch's rating horizon (typically 12 to 18  months for M&A; related activity). Fitch believes the de-leveraging plan would  likely include asset sales including FOXA's DBS business in Italy and Germany in  addition to asset divestures required to gain regulatory approval.  In Fitch's opinion, a potential acquisition of TWX does not address any apparent  material strategic deficit within FOXA's asset and business portfolio. Fitch  holds FOXA's overall strategic positioning in high regard as its businesses  consist of a strong collection of cable networks, leading television and film  studios, national television network with robust sports-programming rights,  local television broadcast assets and international direct broadcast satellite  business. Each of FOXA's businesses have the scale characteristics to operate at  high margins and generate meaningful levels of free cash flow (FCF) and  positions the company to address the secular threats and opportunities presented  by changing media consumption patterns and continued audience fragmentation  across the media and entertainment landscape.  Nonetheless, Fitch recognizes the potential scale benefits related to a Time  Warner acquisition, which in turn can facilitate further investment in  programming and production leading to stronger content creation and brand  development. At the same time, Fitch also recognizes the potential execution,  operational and regulatory risks associated with the transaction. Demand for  high-quality content remains strong across all major end-markets (broadcast,  cable networks and subscription video on demand). Fitch continues to believe  that the entities which control the creation and production of high-quality,  'must have' video content will be better positioned to address secular issues  including evolving media consumption patterns, the emergence of alternative  distribution platforms, growing preference for time-shifted viewing, and growing  competition from online video sources, all of which lead to continuing audience  fragmentation. The potential transaction with Time Warner comes amid  transforming consolidation within the telecommunications and pay-TV sector  including Comcast Corporation's pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable, Inc.  and AT&T;, Inc.'s proposed purchase of DIRECTV creating further risk to the  operating profile.  The centerpiece of any potential transaction with Time Warner would be the  creation of a powerful film and television studio, including premium pay  television programmer HBO, with the ability to create, produce and distribute  high-quality content with a broad audience appeal across multiple distribution  platforms on a global basis. The addition of Time Warner's cable network  business (including an enviable sports rights portfolio associated with those  networks) and the strong competitive position of Time Warner's film and  television studios at Warner Bros. enhances FOX's existing asset portfolio and  could enable FOX to maintain healthy pricing models for their businesses and  protect their ability to attract viewing audiences.  From a credit perspective, Fitch's base case assumes a purchase price of $100  per share with consideration consisting of $50 per share in cash and the  remainder in FOXA non-voting common stock. Fitch notes that its base case should  not be construed as a valuation of Time Warner common stock, or a threshold or  limitation for any rating category, but put forth for illustrative purpose.  Fitch further assumes that there will not be any debt structure issues and  bondholders will benefit from both FOX and Time Warner's businesses and cash  flows. Fitch estimates FOX will issue approximately $40 billion of debt to  facilitate the transaction (in the absence of proceeds from anticipated asset  sales) leading to pro forma leverage of 5.6x as of the LTM period ended March  31, 2014. Pro forma leverage includes $1 billion of anticipated expense  synergies. Pro forma leverage declines to 4.9x assuming $10 billion of net asset  sale proceeds. Fitch case further assumes FOX adopts a conservative capital  structure policy by largely eliminating share repurchases, reducing dividends  and direct free cash flow generation to debt reduction. Fitch's base case  estimates that the combined entity's FCF generation approximates 9% of revenues  initially and grows to nearly 11% of revenues within Fitch's rating horizon.  Additionally leverage trends below 3.5 within the same timeframe and drops to 3x  within three years of the transaction closing likely positioning FOX's credit  profile strongly within the 'BBB' category.  Conversely should the combined entity adopt a more aggressive capital allocation  policy or if FOXA's accepted transaction terms are more aggressive than Fitch's  base case, Fitch maintains that it would be difficult for the combined entity to  maintain the current ratings. However under such a scenario Fitch would expect  that negative rating action would be limited to two notches.

74,FOX,Murdoch's Fox open to giving Time Warner board seats in new bid: Bloomberg,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is open to giving Time Warner Inc shareholders seats on the new company’s board if its takeover bid succeeds, Bloomberg reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the situation. Board representation could appear in a revised proposal, Bloomberg cited one of the people as saying. It did not say how many board seats were being considered and added the two sides are not currently in negotiations. Time Warner’s board rejected Murdoch’s $80 billion takeover offer earlier this month, but the Fox chairman and chief executive officer is expected to continue the pursuit. Bloomberg said the offer of board seats as part of an increased bid could help allay concerns of Time Warner investors about the dual-class stock structure that gives control to Murdoch, 83, and his family. Nathaniel Brown, a spokesman for New York-based Fox, and Keith Cocozza, a spokesman for Time Warner, declined to comment on whether the companies have discussed board seats, Bloomberg said. Mario Gabelli, one of Time Warner’s longest standing shareholders, said in an interview with Bloomberg last week that Murdoch should offer Time Warner investors a couple of board seats. In a deal announced Friday, Britain’s BSkyB agreed to pay $9 billion to buy Murdoch’s pay-TV companies in Germany and Italy. Fox is expected to use the proceeds to fuel its pursuit of Time Warner.

77,FOX,Fitch Places Sky's 'BBB+' on Rating Watch Negative; Guides to Potential 2-Notch Downgrade,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, July 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed British Sky Broadcasting plc's  (Sky) Long term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating of  'BBB+' on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) following the announcement of Sky's  proposed acquisition of 100% of Sky Italia and a 57.4% stake in Sky Deutschland  from Twenty-First Century Fox.  The most likely outcome of the RWN will be a two-notch downgrade to 'BBB-', with  its resolution subject to closing of the deal, which remains subject to  regulatory clearance and shareholder approvals. Management's commitment to an  investment grade rating and track record of delivering targeted metrics is an  important factor. The potential exists for financial metrics that might appear  challenging at the investment grade level, given the required offer to Sky  Deutschland minorities. However, this is not our base case, while Fitch believes  mitigating action would be available and be taken by management in this event.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Announced Transaction, Leverage and Downgrade Impact The transaction, including cash consideration of GBP4.9bn is expected to  increase net debt / EBITDA from approximately 0.8x (YE14; based on unaudited  results) to 2.9x. Fitch guides that, subject to the take-up of the tender to Sky  Deutschland minorities, the transaction is likely to lead to a two-notch  downgrade of Sky's ratings, given the expected deleveraging that management has  guided to over the next two years. Unadjusted (net debt/EBITDA) leverage of 2.9x  (assuming no or minimal Sky Deutschland tender take-up) implies funds from  operations (FFO) net adjusted leverage of around 3.3x - verses a broad threshold  of 3.0x to sustain the ratings at 'BBB-'. Management's guidance of deleveraging  (on an unadjusted basis) of between 0.5x-0.7x by June 2016 should bring the FFO  metric back to an investment grade threshold.  Commitment to Investment Grade Rating Fitch considers Sky's management has a good track record in delivering results,  both operational and financially. Similarly, the execution and integration of  past acquisitions has been good; with financial policies managed to allow a  healthy level of headroom within targeted rating levels. Fitch acknowledges the  commitment that management has made to maintaining its investment grade rating  and that mitigating action is likely if leverage metrics might otherwise be  pressured by a high take-up of the Sky Deutschland minorities tender.  Funding for the transaction(s) including, a successfully completed secondary  share placement raising approximately GBP1.4bn, the cancellation of the share  buyback programme, along with disposals and asset contributions (ie. the recent  disposal of the ITV stake and contribution of its National Geographic stake as  part of the deal consideration), underline management's commitment to contain  the impact of the transaction on Sky's financial metrics.   Sky Deutschland Minorities Tender The risk of a sizeable take-up of the tender by Sky Deutschland's minorities is  not considered high given the absence of an acquisition premium. Take-up of the  tender could theoretically push metrics to a level that might be considered  stretched for an investment grade rating (a 100% take-up by minorities could  potentially push initial net debt/EBITDA leverage to 4.0x), However, this is not  our base case assumption, and Fitch believes mitigating action would be  available to management in the event take-up was higher than expected. Medium-Term Strategic Move In Fitch's view, the transaction(s) are about expanding Sky's addressable  audience. Management has a proven track record of delivering a high quality  pay-TV business in the UK and Ireland. However, the maturity and competition of  these markets may temper further growth, with management regarding the untapped  potential in Germany and Italy, as significant. The acquired businesses are  nonetheless significantly lower margin and the deal expected to be accretive  only in year 3. The agency recognises that management are taking a medium term  strategic view, with the challenge being to convince audiences in these  countries to embrace pay-TV in the way that British audiences do.        2014 Performance Sky reported FY14 results on 25 July, confirming 7% revenue growth to GBP7.6bn  and EBITDA down 1% to GBP1,667m (margin 21.9%). With 2014 a year of investment  amid rising competition in the UK pay-TV and multi-play markets, Sky continues  to perform well. Nonetheless, in Fitch's view, its pay-TV audience is mature and  the competitive environment intensifying; factors which we believe underpin the  proposed acquisition(s). Management has proven adept at expanding its product  offering, maintaining strong KPIs and ensuring the company's position as the  market leader in pay-TV. Operational performance/execution is regarded as  strong, although the announced deal underlines management's willingness to  accept a stretched capital structure in order to develop medium-term goals.       RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative Post-closing FFO net leverage sustainably above 3.0x would be likely to lead to  a downgrade from 'BBB-'; acknowledging that an 18-24 month timeframe will be  allowed before sustainable leverage is achieved. Fitch's rating case assumption  is that this metric will fall to between 2.5x - 3.0x within two years  post-closing.  Operationally, adverse changes to industry dynamics including price erosion,  increasing content costs and capital intensity and increasing regulatory  pressure, leading to significant downward pressure on EBITDA and free cash flow,  would pressure ratings. Positive  Failure of the proposed Sky Deutschland/Italia acquisitions to close, an outcome  which is considered unlikely, and subject to the strength of ongoing  performance, would likely lead to an affirmation of the ratings at 'BBB+'.

78,FOX,Murdoch's Fox expected to push for Time Warner deal on Wednesday,"(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc is expected to make an aggressive case for merging with Time Warner Inc during its quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, though people familiar with the company’s plans have said it would not use that forum to raise its bid. Time Warner is due to report its financial results on Wednesday as well, marking the first time executives from both companies will publicly speak since the offer was first revealed on July 16. It will be an opportunity for Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes to defend his record for shareholder value. Fox’s Chief Operating Officers Chase Carey and James Murdoch will have the chance to discuss the more than $1 billion in cost savings and powerful combination of cable networks and sports programing. It is unclear whether Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of Fox, will make an appearance given the stakes. Fox has offered to buy Time Warner for about $80 billion, or about $85 per share, in a mix of cash and stock. Time Warner turned it down, saying its plan to go it alone “is superior to any proposal” from Fox.  Though Fox is expected to raise its offer it will not rise beyond the range of $90 to $95 per share, a person familiar with Fox told Reuters on July 25. The timing of another offer is unclear. Some analysts have said that an even higher bid would be needed to win over Time Warner management and shareholders. A spokesman for Fox declined to comment. A potential tie-up would create one of the world’s largest media conglomerates, dominating content production with two major studios, a stable of cable networks like Fox News and TNT, broadcast networks and pay-TV channel HBO. Faced with a rash of media distribution mergers, such as Comcast Corp’s proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and AT&T;’s $48.5 billion deal to buy DirecTV, programing creators are responding with their own potential deals to add clout for negotiations with cable and satellite distributors and new entrants like Netflix and Amazon. Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger wrote in a note to investors on Friday that it would be in the interest of both companies to ink a deal. He and his team spoke to hundreds of Fox and Time Warner shareholders and concluded that “most people are supportive.” “To reject the $85 a share offer, you would have to believe that Time Warner would get to $95 a share on its own,” he wrote. “We don’t find very many people who think it will be easy to get there.” A Time Warner spokesman declined to comment. With a backdrop of a rebuffed deal, Time Warner will be on the hook to explain why it is better off going solo. Time Warner has outpaced its peers with 15.2 percent earnings per share growth for the past 5 years, nearly double the median for its competitors, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Can Time Warner demonstrate to shareholders that left alone, the value to shareholders would be meaningfully greater than the $85 bid on the table from Fox?” Alan Gould, managing director at Evercore Partners Inc, asked in a research note. For now, Gould pointed out that there does not seem to be an alternative bidder.

79,FOX,Rupert Murdoch's Fox abandons Time Warner takeover bid,"(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) decided to pull its $80 billion offer to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) on Tuesday, abandoning plans to create one of the world’s largest media conglomerates. The surprise announcement appeared to cut short what many investors had viewed as an inevitable battle of attrition over a deal that would have joined two of Hollywood’s biggest studios and TV networks from TNT to Fox News.      Murdoch, who is Fox’s chairman and CEO, cited Time Warner’s management and its board’s refusal to come to the table to discuss a takeover as one reason for the stunning turnabout.     “Our proposal had significant strategic merit and compelling financial rationale and our approach had always been friendly. However, Time Warner management and its board refused to engage with us to explore an offer which was highly compelling,” he said in a statement released after the market closed on Tuesday.     Murdoch also cited Fox’s share price - down about 11 percent since the offer was unveiled on July 16 - saying it had become undervalued, making the deal “unattractive to Fox shareholders.”  Time Warner, which had fiercely resisted Murdoch’s advance,  issued a statement saying it was committed to enhancing long-term value. “We look forward to continuing to deliver substantial and sustainable returns for all stockholders,” the statement said.     Shares of Fox rose 10.4 percent in after-market trade after closing at $31.30. Shares of Time Warner fell 10.7 percent after closing at $85.19. A source familiar with the matter said that there were no other likely bidders for Time Warner at this point. Still, Time Warner shares are trading at a premium to the offer suggesting that some investors believe another buyer could emerge or Fox may return.  Fox, which split off from News Corp last year, is serious about walking away from Time Warner, additional people familiar with the matter said, citing its announcement of a $6 billion stock buyback at the same time. The people were not authorized to speak to the media about the deal.  Still, Fox’s withdrawal will raise pressure on Time Warner to justify its refusal to engage in negotiations, the drop in its stock price after the announcement and the fact that bolstered takeover defenses by barring its shareholders from calling a special meeting, said Brett Harriss, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, who said Fox could still try again later. “This could easily be part of their negotiating strategy,” he said. Both Fox and Time Warner are set to report their quarterly earnings on Wednesday and will face questions from investors and analysts about their future strategies. The combined companies would have created a media powerhouse with two major studios, cable networks, sports programming and pay-TV channel HBO. A tie-up would have added more muscle to negotiate against media distribution companies that have been going through their own mergers like Comcast’s (CMCSA.O) deal to buy Time Warner Cable TWC.N and AT&T;’s (T.N) proposal to takeover DirecTV DTV.O. The move to walk away is an uncharacteristic one for Murdoch, the 83-year-old media mogul known for his deal-making prowess.  He pounced on Dow Jones in 2007, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, after making an offer to the Bancroft family that was too good to refuse. At $5 billion, representing roughly a 67 percent premium, many thought that Murdoch overpaid. News Corp had to write down  half the value a few years later. Jason Subotky, partner and portfolio manager at Yacktman Asset Management, a large Fox shareholder said, “They showed a willingness to be bold with the proposal and yet were very disciplined. We think this is recognition that buying their own shares back is the most attractive use of capital at this point.” For now, today’s statement from Murdoch signals that shareholder value trumps desire.       “This significant return of capital underscores the company’s ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation and returning value to shareholders in a meaningful way,” Murdoch said in a statement, referring to the buyback plan.

82,FOX,"Fox reports higher profit, insists no deals in the works","(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, the film and TV company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street’s expectations as executives stressed that they would not make a new bid for Time Warner Inc. Fox on Tuesday withdrew the $80 billion offer that Time Warner had rejected. On Wednesday, Murdoch made a rare appearance on Fox’s quarterly earnings call and reinforced that he had ended his pursuit of the rival company. “This is our resolute decision,” Murdoch said. “While we remain opportunistic and nimble, we are a strategically complete company and have a clear sense of where we are going.”  Fox has no plans to pursue another content company as an alternative, Chase Carey, the chief operating officer, added. Shares of Fox rose 4.1 percent at $33.65 in after-hours trading on Wednesday, up from their earlier $32.33 close on Nasdaq. Despite Fox’s announcement on Tuesday that it would no longer pursue a deal with Time Warner, some investors questioned whether the move might be a ploy to drive down the Time Warner stock price and open the way for another bid by Murdoch at a later time. For the fiscal fourth quarter that ended June 30, Fox reported $1.8 billion in operating income before depreciation and amortization, a 19 percent gain from the same period a year earlier, helped by strong results from the summer blockbuster movie “X-Men: Days of Future Past.”  On an adjusted basis, the company earned 42 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 38 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 17 percent to $8.42 billion.

The success of the films, and others such as “The Fault in our Stars,” helped the film studio become the first to cross the $3 billion mark in worldwide box office sales this year, the company said. Fox’s cable network business, its largest, saw its earnings rise 11 percent to $1.2 billion, boosted by higher advertising sales and an increase in subscriptions to regional sports channels.

84,FOX,UPDATE 5-Time Warner to go it alone as Fox exits stage,"* Bewkes says company already at scale * Time Warner posts higher-than-expected profit, sets buyback * Revenue rose 3 percent to $6.79 billion * Shares close down 13 percent   (Adds remarks from Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch and COO Chase Carey) By Jennifer Saba and Aurindom Mukherjee Aug 6 (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc will not have to worry about any overtures from Twenty-First Century Fox  for the foreseeable future. “As you know, yesterday, we walked away. This is our resolute decision,” Fox Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch said in a rare appearance on the company’s conference call late Wednesday. Murdoch, conceding defeat, was further explaining the company’s rational for pulling its bid on Tuesday. Fox Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey backed up Murdoch and went further: “Let me be clear, we are done ... We have no plans to pursue any other third party content company as an alternative to Time Warner.” Earlier, Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes, speaking on the company’s own earnings conference call, also weighed in on the scuttled Fox bid, which the CNN and Warner Brothers studios owner had aggressively resisted, as well as the merits of megadeals in general. “I would just encourage everybody to look at all sides of the issue when contemplating the benefits and risks of putting very large companies together,” Bewkes said to an analyst. Indeed, since taking the helm of the media conglomerate in 2008, Bewkes has trimmed down Time Warner - shedding properties like AOL, Time Warner Cable, and Time Inc  - and making it an attractive target for acquisitive-hungry rivals. Bewkes said he feels that Time Warner is already at scale, especially for its studio business Warner Bros which he described as the “biggest producer of content in the world” to its collection of cable networks which also dominate. “We are not lacking something we need,” he said. Time Warner needs to show it can go it alone after fiercely refusing to engage in talks with Fox, which offered to buy it in a deal for about $80 billion and would have created one of the world’s largest media companies with two major studios, a bevy of cable networks and pay-TV channel HBO. Time Warner reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday and boosted its share buyback program by an additional $5 billion. “When faced with a hostile takeover bid, Time Warner did exactly what they should have done. They crushed the numbers,” wrote Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson Research in a note to investors. The strong results and shareholder-friendly measure could not prevent Time Warner’s stock from sliding. The shares closed down 13 percent at $74.24 - well below the $85 per share offer from Rupert Murdoch’s Fox. Time Warner said it will host an investor’s day in the fall to unveil more details about its long-term strategy. Revenue from Time Warner’s Home Box Office unit jumped 17 percent to $1.42 billion for the second quarter, helped by the popularity of “Game of Thrones” and other HBO shows. The company said the fourth season of “Game of Thrones,” which ended in June, was the most watched season of an original series in HBO’s history. The Emmy award-winning fantasy epic had an average gross audience of 19 million viewers. The company’s Turner Networks unit - home to CNN, TBS and TNT - also posted an increase in revenue on higher subscription and advertisement sales. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders rose to $843 million, or 94 cents per share, for the three months ended June 30, from $698 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 98 cents per share. Revenue increased to $6.79 billion from $6.61 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 84 cents a share on revenue of $6.87 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company forecast full-year 2014 adjusted profit growth in the low teens in terms of percentage, off a base of 2013 adjusted earnings of $3.51 per share. Time Warner said in April it expected its full-year adjusted profit to grow in the low- to mid-teen percentage range, or better, for at least the next three or four years.

86,FOX,Investors betting on takeover of Time Warner face ugly reckoning,"(Reuters) - Many options traders who had taken bets on a successful buyout of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) by Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) are facing a grim lesson in the risks of betting on deals.  Murdoch pulled the $80 billion offer after the close of trading on Tuesday, saying Time Warner management had refused to engage in discussions. He also cited the sharp drop in Fox’s share price since the proposal last month, saying it “makes the transaction unattractive to Fox shareholders.” Time Warner shares dove about 10 percent to $76.80 from $85.19 following news of the offer’s withdrawal, while Fox’s stock gained around 9 percent. Expectations that Fox would increase its bid to at least $90  a share and even above $100 a share had prompted traders and investors to put down a series of bets. There are more than 25,000 out-of-the-money call option contracts expiring in mid-October that anticipate Time Warner to close at a price anywhere between $90 a share and $105 a share.  Each call or put option contract represents the right to buy or sell 100 shares at a particular price. There are more than 12,700 outstanding contracts that bet on Time Warner shares to close above $92.50 by mid-October. Just after the Fox bid, those options surged to trade at a peak of $3.09 each.  Since then hopes of a deal had diminished as Time Warner made it clear it didn’t want to talk to Fox about a deal. The mid-October options closed Tuesday at $1.20 each and are expected to fall sharply when the market opens on Wednesday. If a trader had bought all those contracts at the peak, the cost would have been about $3.92 million. They are now worth about $1.52 million and the value is expected to drop much further.  Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial Research, in Austin, Texas, said that if Time Warner shares do indeed open about $10 lower on Wednesday, the mid-October options would likely see their value drop to about 10 or 11 cents. “You’re looking at a 90 percent drop in value,” he said. “Unless they got those positions before the announcement, they probably paid a lot and were looking to get a small gain.”  Indeed, that looks like a distinct possibility if Tuesday’s after hours swoon in Time Warner shares continues into trading on Wednesday.  There are also plenty of positions expiring in August and September that are in danger of turning into losers. More than 17,000 call options contracts in Time Warner that expect a close above $85 currently trade at $1.65 each option - and they expire next week. At their peak, those contracts would have cost $6.89 million and are now worth about $2.81 million.   Notably, trading on Time Warner options on Tuesday was dominated by put buying, according to J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist for TD Ameritrade. Activity in puts outweighed action in calls by nearly a three-to-one ratio, which Kinahan said was primarily investors buying puts as a protective move by those holding Time Warner shares. At least one asset manager who bailed on the stock before the announcement said Time Warner just looked too pricey at the Fox offer price of around $85 a share. “We compared Time Warner to Netflix and Amazon and felt it was way too rich in terms of valuation,” said Diane Garnick, CEO of asset management firm Clear Alternatives LLC in New York. Her firm sold the stock last week.  She said millennials represent a growing part of those who view content but don’t use cable as much as older generations.  One event investor, who are commonly called arbitrageurs, said he was relieved he had avoided the temptation to get in on the buy-Time Warner-sell-Fox trade after Fox’s offer was first made public in mid-July. “Thankfully we stayed away,” said the investor, who declined to be identified. “Lots of event and arb funds had the long Time Warner and short Fox trade on. I don’t think many avoided it.” ",8062014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-timewarner-fox-arbs/investors-betting-on-takeover-of-time-warner-face-ugly-reckoning-idUSKBN0G600120140806
87,FOX,Book publishing helps News Corp beat revenue estimates,"(Reuters) - News Corp (NWSA.O), publisher of the Wall Street Journal, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue as growth in its book publishing business helped to make up for a decline in revenue in its bigger news and information division. News Corp, whose shares were up marginally at $17.50 in after-market trading on Thursday, has been focusing more on book publishing as its newspaper business struggles with weak ad spending in an increasingly digital world. The results mark the first full year since controlling shareholder Rupert Murdoch separated his publishing assets from his entertainment and cable TV businesses, which are now housed in 21st Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O). Apart from the Journal, News Corp’s properties include the Australian newspaper, book publishers HarperCollins and Harlequin Enterprises, stakes in Australian pay-TV and digital real estate businesses, and education company Amplify. Revenue from book publishing rose about 10 percent to $361 million in the fourth quarter ended June 30, helped by the popularity of the “Divergent” series of young-adult science fiction novels by Veronica Roth published by HarperCollins. Book publishing accounts for about 16.5 percent of the company’s total revenue. Revenue in the company’s news and information division fell 6.2 percent to $1.56 billion as both ad revenue and subscription sales dropped. Total revenue fell 3 percent to $2.19 billion, slightly beating the average estimate of $2.17 billion. Net income available to the company’s shareholders totaled $12.0 million, or 2 cents per share, in the quarter compared with a loss of $1.12 billion, or $1.94 per share, year earlier. The year-earlier figure reflected a writedown in the value of the company’s Australian and U.S. publishing assets. On an adjusted basis, News Corp reported a profit of 1 cent per share, falling short of the average analyst estimate of 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

88,FOX,Wall Street ends down on heightened Russia concerns,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks ended lower on Thursday, continuing a recent streak of weakness as Russia’s surprisingly harsh retaliatory measures in response to Western sanctions raised concerns about global growth. In addition to Moscow’s ban on imports of many Western foods, following sanctions imposed for Russia’s support of rebels in eastern Ukraine, investors worried that the conflict between Russian and Ukraine is escalating, with the downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet. The declines briefly dragged the Dow below its 200-day moving average in afternoon trading. The S&P; 500 is now nearly 4 percent below the record closing high it set last month While the full extent of the sanctions are still unknown, escalating tensions in Russia could continue to spur selling in stocks, analysts said. “Before this point, U.S. investors have always thought of geopolitical concerns as being largely no more than a 24-hour event. Now, the growing concern is that the outlook for global growth is pointing down,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. “To that extent, investors seem more prone to selling, and asking questions later rather than buying the dip as they had become accustomed to doing in the past.” All but one of the S&P; 500’s industry sectors ended down on the day, backtracking from brief gains in the morning. Consumer staples shares .SPCOMS, the bright spot of trading on Wednesday, slipped 0.8 percent on Thursday, while utilities .SPCOMU shares posted the sole sector gains. Health insurer stocks were poor performers, dipping after Goldman Sachs downgraded Aetna (AET.N) to “neutral” and cut earnings estimates on a number of its peers. Aetna (AET.N) shares slid 4.0 percent to $75.22, UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) shares lost 2.7 percent to $79.26 and Cigna shares (CI.N) fell 3.0 percent to $88.75. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 75.07 points, or 0.46 percent, to 16,368.27, the S&P; 500 .SPX ended down 10.67 points, or 0.56 percent, to 1,909.57, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 20.09 points, or 0.46 percent, to 4,334.97. Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) surged 5.1 percent to $33.97 after the company’s quarterly profit beat Wall Street’s expectations. Jobless claims reports lent optimism to the market in the morning as the four-week claims average fell to its lowest level since February 2006, suggesting labor market conditions are continuing to improve.  About 5.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the five-day average of 6.9 billion.

92,FOX,WikiLeaks' Assange hopes to exit London embassy if UK lets him,"LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has spent over two years in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid a sex crimes inquiry in Sweden, said on Monday he planned to leave the building “soon”, but Britain signaled it would still arrest him if he tried.    Assange made the surprise assertion during a news conference alongside Ecuador’s Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino. But his spokesman played down the chances of an imminent departure, saying the British government would first need to revise its position and let him leave without arrest, something it has repeatedly refused to do. The 43-year-old Australian fled to the embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition for questioning in Sweden over sex assault and rape allegations, which he denies.  He says he fears that if extradited to Sweden he would then be handed over to the United States, where he could be tried for one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.  Assange would be arrested if he exited the London embassy because he has breached his British bail terms. “I am leaving the embassy soon ... but perhaps not for the reasons that Murdoch press and Sky news are saying at the moment,” Assange told reporters at the embassy in central London. Britain’s Sky News, part owned by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, had earlier reported that Assange was considering leaving the embassy due to deteriorating health. WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of confidential U.S. documents on the Internet in 2010. That embarrassed the United States, and some critics say it put national security and people’s lives at risk. Ecuador later granted Assange political asylum. But he was unable to leave Britain and has ended up living in the embassy’s cramped quarters in central London.  His comments briefly raised the possibility of his leaving imminently. But Kristinn Hrafnsson, his spokesman, told reporters that he could only do so if the British government “calls off the siege outside”. Assange had no intention of handing himself over to the police, he added.   Ecuador’s Patino said he would try to hold talks with his British counterpart to resolve the case. Recent changes to British extradition laws may mean Assange would not be facing extradition if his case had just started.  Britain’s Foreign Office said it remained as committed as ever to reaching a diplomatic solution to the problem, but reiterated that Assange still needed to be extradited.  “As ever we look to Ecuador to help bring this difficult, and costly, situation to an end,” a spokeswoman said.  The Assange issue has put Britain and Ecuador at odds, with London angered by the decision of Ecuador’s socialist President Rafael Correa to grant him asylum and Quito unhappy at the British refusal to allow him safe passage. Asked about his health, Assange said anyone would be affected by spending two years in a building with no outside areas or direct sunlight, a complaint he has made several times before.

94,FOX,Fox loses bid to halt TV monitoring service,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fox News cannot stop a media monitoring service from recording snippets of its broadcasts and offering them to clients, some of which use them to criticize the network, a New York federal judge ruled on Tuesday. Fox, which is owned by Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, sued TVEyes Inc for copyright infringement in 2013, calling it a “parasitic” service that was leeching profits from its considerable investments in producing content for its cable channels.  U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan disagreed, saying TVEyes’ copying and indexing of the clips fairly used the cable news channel’s content in line with copyright law.  He denied Fox’s demand for an injunction against TVEyes. A representative of Fox News said the court reserved judgment on whether other aspects of TVEyes’ database - the ability to archive and email clips, for instance - also amount to fair use. Another hearing is set for Oct. 3.    The Connecticut-based TVEyes’ clients include the U.S. Army, the White House, members of Congress, and local and state police departments, which use it to track news coverage of events, according to Hellerstein. He said Internet searches would not yield as comprehensive results as a search of TVEyes.  “Thus, without TVEyes, this information cannot otherwise be gathered and searched,” the judge said. It was this factor that made TVEyes’ service “transformative,” he explained, a key factor in determining whether any infringement occurred.  Based on its clients’ many uses of the service, Hellerstein added, TVEyes “provides substantial benefit to the public.”  “We are very pleased with the decision,” TVEyes Chief Executive Officer David Ives said in an email. TVEyes argued in court filings that another benefit of the service is that it facilitates criticism of Fox. It singled out one client, the George Soros-funded Media Matters, which monitors various media for “conservative misinformation” and frequently criticizes Fox.  To halt this, TVEyes argued, would give Fox “control over the public’s right to continue to access information and effectively engage in political discourse.” The case is Fox News Network v. TVEyes Inc, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 13-cv-5315.

In doing so, he forecast adjusted earnings per share of $6 by 2016 and $8 by 2018.

104,FOX,TV adaptation of Ebola best-seller 'The Hot Zone' in the works,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Fox’s television studio has been developing an adaptation of the best-selling 1994 Ebola chronicle “The Hot Zone” for more than a year, the Twenty-First Century Fox Inc-owned company said on Friday. “It’s a strange and upsetting coincidence that we all happen to be experiencing this current scare, and we’re of course extremely sensitive about it,” Executive Producer Lynda Obst, who is developing the project with Fox TV Studios and “Alien” director Ridley Scott’s Scott Free Productions, said in a statement.  “While we are far from a finished product that, regardless, would never air during this current news cycle, I do think Preston’s take is illuminating, particularly with some distance,” Obst said. If the adaptation of Richard Preston’s non-fiction thriller about viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola makes it into production, it will likely be as a limited-run series, Fox TV Studios said. The book describes the discovery of a virus related to Ebola in a primate quarantine facility in Reston, Virginia in 1989.

105,FOX,TV adaptation of Ebola best-seller 'The Hot Zone' in the works,"LOS ANGELES, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Fox’s television studio has been developing an adaptation of the best-selling 1994 Ebola chronicle “The Hot Zone” for more than a year, the Twenty-First Century Fox Inc-owned company said on Friday. “It’s a strange and upsetting coincidence that we all happen to be experiencing this current scare, and we’re of course extremely sensitive about it,” Executive Producer Lynda Obst, who is developing the project with Fox TV Studios and “Alien” director Ridley Scott’s Scott Free Productions, said in a statement. “While we are far from a finished product that, regardless, would never air during this current news cycle, I do think Preston’s take is illuminating, particularly with some distance,” Obst said. If the adaptation of Richard Preston’s non-fiction thriller about viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola makes it into production, it will likely be as a limited-run series, Fox TV Studios said. The book describes the discovery of a virus related to Ebola in a primate quarantine facility in Reston, Virginia in 1989. The current Ebola outbreak has killed more than 4,500 people since March, mostly in the three impoverished West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization.

106,FOX,Vivendi rethink on Polish TV investment sparks sale speculation,"* Vivendi and ITI review options for 51 pct stake in Poland’s TVN * Time Warner and 21st Century Fox seen as potential buyers * TVN shares jump 7 pct on news By Adrian Krajewski and Gwénaëlle Barzic WARSAW/PARIS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - American media giants have been touted as potential buyers for Polish broadcaster TVN  after France’s Vivendi and Poland-based holding company ITI signalled that they could sell their joint 51 per cent stake. ITI and Vivendi announced late on Thursday that they will conduct a review of their options for TVN, lifting shares in the broadcaster by as much as 7 poercent in early trading on Friday. A sale would open an opportunity for another big media player to enter Poland’s rebounding market of 38 million people, with analysts naming Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox as prospective buyers. Vivendi’s Canal Plus agreed to buy into TVN, one of Poland’s two largest private broadcasters, three years ago. A wider deal also included a merger of the two sides’ pay-TV platforms into nc+, which made Poland Vivendi’s second-largest market. Canal Plus said it would rather focus on nc+, Poland’s second-largest pay TV platform with 2.2 million users, as part of a broader strategy of moving away from free-to-air television, where advertising revenues are threatened by the Internet and on-demand TV viewing. “The timing is not bad,” Espirito Santo analyst Konrad Ksiezopolski said. “The advertising market in Poland is gaining steam, TV ads are rising and despite the Internet’s growing popularity it is still the strongest advertising channel.” “Per capita spending on TV advertising is still low in Poland, even in comparison with the Czech Republic or Hungary, which indicates a chance for growth.” TVN and Canal Plus originally expected their tie-up to bring in annual savings of more than 250 million zlotys ($76 million) in its third year, with core profit of 550 million zlotys in 2015. Instead, the third year could bring an ownership overhaul. “No timetable has been set. Every option is open,” a source familiar with the matter said, adding that Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan have the mandate for the option review. The source added that the Polish TV market is becoming increasingly competitive, with a possible launch by U.S. video-streaming company Netflix next year. Canal Plus is losing customers in its domestic market to widely available free channels, prompting the move to expand internationally by focusing on businesses in Poland, Vietnam, French-speaking Africa and more recently in Canada. Under a two-year strategic overhaul, Vivendi sold its French telecoms operator SFR and video games maker Activision Blizzard. After the SFR sale, Canal Plus will be Vivendi’s largest results driver, bringing in about 40 percent of operating profit, compared with 33 percent for Vivendi’s Universal Music Group and 27 percent for its Brazilian telecoms business GVT, which is also for sale. ITI, which has moved into multimedia from such disparate businesses as electronics imports and potato chips, is finishing its own clearout to cut debt costs, with TVN the last of its most-prized assets. Analysts told Reuters that Time Warner - owner of movie studio Warner Bros, cable network Turner Broadcasting and pay-TV channel HBO - could merge TVN with its Czech broadcaster CME. Time Warner rival Discovery Communications and Germany’s Bertelsmann and RTL Group could also join the race. “If the transaction happens, it will be with a market premium,” Raiffeisen analyst Dominik Niszcz said. “Vivendi paid over 20 zlotys per share for its TVN stake and it can be assumed that it would want to book over 20 zlotys now.” After their initial jump, TVN shares were trading at 14.45 zlotys at 1435 GMT, up 0.3 percent on the day, valuing the company at about 5 billion zlotys.

109,FOX,21st Century Fox to tread carefully with streaming video,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey said the company is being “disciplined” about its options when considering streaming video offerings that bypass cable and satellite subscriptions. “We believe the traditional bundle offers great value to consumers and will be the primary consumer package for years to come,” Carey said on Tuesday during an third quarter earnings call with analysts. He was referring to traditional cable packages that “bundle” together several channels for one price. Consumers have drastically changed the way they watch television, opting for on-demand content offered by Netflix Inc or Amazon.com Inc that can be viewed on a array of devices from TVs to smartphones to tablets.  The shift has prompted several big media companies, notably Time Warner Inc and CBS Corp, to announce products that stream TV programs and movies over the Internet without a cable subscription.  Carey said on the call that changing viewing habits “also means we’ll be able to engage the consumer more directly, to create more exciting and valuable experiences. “We are not going to be reactive,” he added. “We want to make sure we are proactive about forming our own judgments about what kinds of offerings that are additive to our business that exist today.” Also on Tuesday, Fox reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, helped by growth in its cable network and film studio businesses. The company reported a 12 percent rise in revenue to $7.89 million, which beat analysts’ average estimate of $6.25 billion, largely driven by the box-office success of “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” and “The Fault in Our Stars.” Fox shares rose 1.6 percent to $33.85 after the bell on Tuesday. Revenue from cable networks, the company’s largest business, rose 15 percent to $3.23 billion, while filmed entertainment revenue was up 17 percent at $2.48 billion.

Britain’s dominant pay-TV provider said in June it would buy the Sky Italia business and a 57 percent stake in Sky Deutschland from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox for 4.9 billion pounds in cash plus a stake in a TV channel.  However under German takeover rules it also had to make the offer available to the German firm’s independent investors and despite the relatively low offer, it has ended up with 90 percent of the company.  Announcing the completion of the deal, BSkyB said on Wednesday it had paid 6.9 billion pounds for the two companies, including 6.5 billion pounds in cash.  It said at the time of the deal it had funding in place to acquire 100 percent of Sky Deutschland if all the shareholders tendered their shares, but that it would be equally happy to own just the 57 percent holding owned by Murdoch.  BSkyB noted that both Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s had indicated recently that BSkyB was expected to maintain its investment grade credit ratings.

113,FOX,Fox loses U.S. copyright claims over Dish ad-skipper,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge has rejected portions of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s lawsuit seeking to stop Dish Network Corp from selling devices that let viewers skip over commercials when playing back shows. In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles rejected copyright claims that Fox had brought over the Hopper, Dish’s digital recording device. Gee invoked last June’s U.S. Supreme Court decision against the video streaming company Aereo Inc in concluding that Dish’s “sling” technology, which lets programs be viewed on a wide range of mobile devices, did not constitute a “public performance” that infringed Fox copyrights. However, Gee allowed Fox to pursue some claims on whether Dish violated a contract governing distribution of Fox programming. In a statement on Tuesday, Fox spokesman Scott Grogin said the company welcomed Gee’s contract rulings, and was disappointed by her copyright findings. “This case is not, and has never been, about consumer rights or new technology,” Grogin said. “It’s always been about protecting creative works from being exploited without permission.” In a statement, Dish said it welcomed the ruling. “Consumers are the winners today, as the court sided with them on the key copyright issues in this case,” the company said. The 63-page decision is dated January 12 and had been under seal. It may narrow the remaining litigation in a 3-year-old battle in which broadcasters accused Dish of using technology that infringed copyrights, and threatened advertising revenue by letting subscribers skip over commercials. CBS Corp and Walt Disney Co’s ABC had settled similar litigation last year, as part of broader settlements allowing Dish to broadcast the networks’ programs. Similar litigation against Dish by Comcast Corp’s  NBCUniversal had been put on hold pending developments in the Fox case. Fox had been scheduled to go to trial against Dish on Feb. 24, but the case has been put on hold until Oct. 1.

The end of the probe, disclosed by News Corp in a regulatory filing on Monday, comes after the U.S. government spent years combing through thousands of e-mails from News Corp’s servers. A U.S. law enforcement official confirmed to Reuters that the case, which included an investigation of possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, had been closed by the Justice Department. News Corp was notified about the decision on Jan. 28. The FBI was not immediately available to comment.  The investigation was related to the 2011 phone hacking and bribery charges involving News Corp’s British newspaper, the now-defunct News of the World. Journalists from News Corp’s daily tabloid The Sun have also faced prosecution by British authorities.   Rupert Murdoch controls both News Corp and Fox, which split into separate businesses in 2013.

119,FOX,Saudi's Kingdom Holding sells 5.6 percent stake in News Corp,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, the investment firm owned by billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, sold most of its stake in media giant News Corp (NWSA.O) as part of a portfolio review, it said on Wednesday. The sale of a 5.6 percent stake in News Corp generated 705 million riyals ($188 million) of cash for Kingdom and leaves it with a one percent holding, according to a bourse statement. The amount of profit or loss booked on the investment was not disclosed. Kingdom has held a stake in Rupert Murdoch’s media conglomerate since 1997, according to its website. It has been a turbulent few years for the media company, after it emerged in 2011 that one of its British tabloid newspapers, the now-defunct News of the World, had been hacking phones and bribing public officials. News Corp said on Tuesday it would face no charges in the United States over the matter, although it still faces multiple investigations and court cases in Britain. “We remain firm believers in News Corp’s competent management, led by chief executive Robert Thomson, and are fully supportive of Rupert Murdoch and his family,” Alwaleed said in a separate emailed statement. The action would not impact on Kingdom’s 6.6 percent holding of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O), the emailed statement added. Both News Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox were part of the same company until they were spun off into separate listed entities in June 2013, representing the previous firm’s publishing and broadcasting businesses respectively. The sale of shares by Kingdom was “predominantly executed” in the first half of 2014 and finalised by the end of the year, the statement said. News Corp hit its highest level since the stock was split on Mar. 5, 2014, when it traded intraday at $18.53, and was as high as $18.29 on July 24 before slipping to an intraday low of $14.28 on Oct. 16, according to Thomson Reuters data. The media firm, which is due to report second-quarter earnings on Friday, closed on Tuesday at $15.61. Kingdom’s stake decreased from 13.18 million class B shares, representing approximately 6.6 percent ownership, to 2 million class B shares, representing around 1 percent ownership. The funds generated from the sale will be reinvested elsewhere, the English-language bourse statement said. However, in an Arabic-language statement on the bourse website, Kingdom also said part of the proceeds will be used to reduce some of the company’s debts.

120,FOX,"Fox says dollar, shifting viewers to weigh on 2016 profit","(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc cut its profit forecast for the next financial year after the dollar strengthened and as more viewers and advertisers swap its broadcast networks for on-demand TV. Shares of the company, helmed by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, fell 6 percent to $32.57 in extended trading on Wednesday. Fox expects a profit in “the mid $7 billion range” for the financial year ending June 2016, Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey said after the company reported quarterly results. Fox had previously forecast 2016 profit of about $8 billion. “We anticipate the industry trends impacting advertising will be slightly larger than previously expected, as both advertising and viewership continues to migrate to digital platforms,” Carey said on a conference call with analysts. Viewers have made drastic changes to the way they watch television, opting for on-demand content offered by Netflix Inc or Amazon.com Inc, which can be viewed on a array of devices from TVs to smartphones to tablets. According to Trefis, a research company, ratings have been softer this season for scripted shows on Fox’s broadcast network, such as supernatural drama “Sleepy Hollow” and “New Girl”, a sitcom starring Zooey Deschanel. Softer ratings will hit advertising revenues, a trend that is likely to be exacerbated by rising programming costs, Trefis said in a report published on Feb. 3. (bit.ly/1xkI2Fy) Fox also joins a growing list of U.S. corporations to be hit by the strengthening of the dollar, which gained nearly 13 percent against a basket of currencies in 2014. Carey said 2016 profit would take a $200 million hit from currency moves in addition to a $250 million hit that the company had already been anticipating.

Viewers have made drastic changes to the way they watch television, opting for on-demand content offered by Netflix Inc  or Amazon.com Inc, which can be viewed on a array of devices from TVs to smartphones to tablets. According to Trefis, a research company, ratings have been softer this season for scripted shows on Fox’s broadcast network, such as supernatural drama “Sleepy Hollow” and “New Girl”, a sitcom starring Zooey Deschanel. Softer ratings will hit advertising revenues, a trend that is likely to be exacerbated by rising programming costs, Trefis said in a report published on Feb. 3. (bit.ly/1xkI2Fy) Fox also joins a growing list of U.S. corporations to be hit by the strengthening of the dollar, which gained nearly 13 percent against a basket of currencies in 2014. Carey said 2016 profit would take a $200 million hit from currency moves in addition to a $250 million hit that the company had already been anticipating. Despite the gloomy outlook, quarterly profit came in ahead of analysts’ estimates, helped by higher affiliate and advertising revenue in the company’s cable business and the box-office success of “The Maze Runner” and “Gone Girl”. Fox grossed a larger chunk of theater ticket sales from “The Maze Runner”, which was released in September, in the October-December quarter. “Gone Girl”, a thriller based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, has grossed about $368 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. Excluding items, the company earned 53 cents per share for the second quarter ended Dec. 31. Revenue fell to $8.06 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 42 cents on revenue of $7.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

122,FOX,"Exclusive: Top Fox investors seek to convert voting shares, Murdoch may benefit - sources","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several top investors in Twenty-First Century Fox Inc are pressing for the right to swap their voting shares for ordinary shares, which are trading at an unusual premium, even though the move could hand even more control of the company to Rupert Murdoch, according to people familiar with the matter. Fox’s dual-class share structure already gives the 83-year-old media mogul control over 39.7 percent of voting rights, even though he and his family hold only a 12 percent equity stake. Several Fox investors, which collectively own 8 percent of voting rights, have been unhappy about the relative performance of their shares since the company delisted from the Australian stock exchange last May, the people said. Historically, the voting shares had traded at a premium. In the five years before the delisting, the Class B shares, which carry voting rights, traded at an average premium of 6.2 percent over the ordinary Class A shares. But the delisting caused some Australian institutional funds to sell their B shares, which now trade at a 3 percent discount to the A shares. Frustrated with the gap, several top Fox shareholders have met with management in recent months to press for amendments to the company’s charter to allow voting shares to be convertible into ordinary shares, according to the people, who requested anonymity as the discussions are private. They said the investors, which include major hedge funds, believe conversion rights would push up the value of the B shares, pointing to CBS Corp and Comcast Corp as examples. The voting shares of both companies can be converted and they trade at a premium to ordinary shares. Some of the Fox investors plan to take their proposals to the next annual general meeting, expected in the fall, said the sources familiar with the matter. Changing Fox’s charter would require approval from a majority of shareholders with voting rights. It is unclear how much support there would be for this campaign. A Fox spokesman declined to comment.  At least two major institutional investors said they had no desire to convert their shares and lose voting rights. Other shareholders may be wary that conversion would leave Murdoch with an even bigger share of the remaining voting shares.  In the past, some pension funds and shareholder proxy advisors have criticized Murdoch’s command over his media empire, and pushed to separate his chairman and chief executive roles, among other things. Fox, which owns the Twentieth Century Fox film studio as well as broadcast and cable television networks, was spun off from News Corp in 2013 amid shareholder pressure surrounding the phone hacking scandal involving Murdoch’s newspapers in Britain. (News Corp’s voting shares are also not convertible into ordinary shares.) Following the split, Fox chose to delist from the Australian stock exchange, in part to cut compliance costs and consolidate trading on the Nasdaq to boost liquidity in the U.S. market. The move forced Australian institutional funds that are not permitted to own foreign-listed securities to wind down their positions in Fox. That process is still going on, and has taken longer than some investors expected, people familiar with the matter said.  Adding to the pressure, the voting shares have not so far been accepted on any S&P; Dow Jones indices, whereas the ordinary shares have. S&P; Dow Jones said the voting shares will be indexed in September, which would open them up to index mutual funds, exchange traded funds and index portfolios - that could help the voting shares rebalance.  Fox’s ordinary A shares have risen 3.8 percent over the past six months to $33.58, while the voting B shares have gained 2.7 percent to $32.57. The average A share trading volume per day is about 12 million shares, versus the B share volume is 4 million shares. There are 1.4 billion A shares and 800 million B shares. Some top Fox investors are willing to give up their voting rights because Murdoch already holds a controlling stake, the sources said. Even if Murdoch’s voting rights increase, these funds believe it would not change the way the business is run.  “Once you own the controlling block that he does, the vote is not worth a terrible lot,” said one of the sources. As for ordinary shareholders, the prospect of convertibility could be an overhang on the common shares, said Eddie Best, a lawyer specializing in capital markets at Mayer Brown LLP.  Class B “shareholders are unlikely to exercise their conversion rights if they don’t have plans to sell,” he said.  As for ordinary shareholders, “they might not love it but they might not have a choice,” Best said.

125,FOX,'Birdman' leap makes Fox Searchlight shine at Oscars,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Fox Searchlight, the arthouse film division of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), dominated the Academy Awards on Sunday with eight awards including the coveted best picture prize for its absurd comedy-drama “Birdman.” The recognition at the film industry’s top honors will likely boost theater, DVD and digital sales for “Birdman,” which has collected $76 million at global box offices.  It was the second best-picture trophy in a row for Fox Searchlight after last year’s victory for “12 Years a Slave.”    The studio also scored with offbeat winner “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” which took home four trophies in technical categories. Movie studios mount months-long, multi-million dollar campaigns for Oscar trophies to earn prestige, grab bragging rights they can use in advertising, and kickstart ticket or home entertainment sales.  “Birdman” is a surreal story about a washed-up movie star trying to rebuild his career with a stint on Broadway. It was filmed in an unusual style in what seems like one long, continuous take featuring an avian alter-ego with a booming voice.     “Everything sounds so risky,” Mexican director Alejandro Inarritu said backstage after the awards show. “Fox Searchlight, they are smart guys. They trusted me. It could have been a disaster.” The post-Oscar bump for each of the last five best picture winners has translated into $9.7 million at domestic theaters, said Keith Simanton, managing editor of movie website IMDB.  A win also helps stimulate interest in international markets, Simanton said. “The Oscars are a powerful brand,” he said.  “Birdman” prevailed in what many Oscar watchers called a two-way contest with coming-of-age tale “Boyhood” from small distributor IFC Films, a unit of AMC Networks Inc (AMCX.O). “Boyhood” ended the night with one trophy for best supporting actress Patricia Arquette. IFC Films was new to the best-picture race. The New York-based distributor abandoned most film production about a decade ago but stuck with “Boyhood,” which was filmed for a few weeks each year for 12 years using the same cast.  “To find a financier to give us money, even though it was only $2.8 million, that’s a big investment to make with no safety net,” Arquette said backstage. Sony’s (6758.T) movie studio, which was hit by a devastating cyber attack in December, earned four awards including best supporting actor for J.K. Simmons in “Whiplash” and best actress for Julianne Moore in “Still Alice.” Another best picture contender, “American Sniper” from Warner Bros. (TWX.N), grabbed only one Oscar, for sound editing. But it is far ahead of fellow nominees at the box office, having collected more than $428 million in global ticket sales. Walt Disney Animation Studios, a unit of The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), won the animated feature prize for a second year in a row, this time with “Big Hero 6” about an inflatable oversized waddling robot.  The privately held Weinstein Company, a master of awards campaigns, won best documentary feature with “Citizenfour” about U.S. government whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Rupert Murdoch’s New York-listed media conglomerate said in a stock market filing on Thursday its Australian unit would increase its stake in APN to 14.99 percent, the maximum shareholding it can hold without requiring regulatory approval. A person familiar with the matter said News Corp had previously held a 4.9 percent stake in APN, which owns some of Australia’s top-rated radio stations and is the publisher of about 50 regional newspapers in Australia and New Zealand, including the New Zealand Herald. News Corp’s purchase marked the exit of APN’s longtime major shareholder, Ireland’s Independent News & Media Plc (INM). INM is selling its 18.6 percent stake to repay its debts in full, while Baycliffe, controlled by INM’s largest shareholder Denis O’Brien, is selling its 12.2 percent holding.   INM’s London-listed shares were trading 20 percent higher. APN said News Corp had bought the stake for 88 cents per share, or a total A$136 million.

141,FOX,"With a prince's backing, James Murdoch may soon ascend at Fox","(Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is in no doubt that James Murdoch is ready to take a much bigger role at Twenty-First Century Fox, by far the largest part of the media empire that James’ father Rupert Murdoch built.  “James is a giant!” said Alwaleed, a Murdoch family ally and one of Fox’s top shareholders with a 6.6 percent voting stake, in an interview. In particular, Alwaleed points to what he says is James’ ability to grasp the digital world and understand how it is transforming the media landscape, adding: “I really love him!”  The billionaire prince’s seal of approval - and increasing acceptance of James by other shareholders - may be laying the ground for Fox to give the 42-year-old day-to-day control of the company sooner rather than later.  One person familiar with the family’s thinking said James, who is currently co-chief operating officer with Chase Carey, could take over fully from Carey - who also holds the title of president - as early as the end of this year. The source cautioned that the change hasn’t been formalized and could be subject to delay. It is also unclear what title James would take or whether there is any possibility that Rupert Murdoch, 84, would relinquish the Fox CEO position to him anytime soon. Carey’s contract is set to expire on June 30, 2016, but he can leave the company as early as the end of this year with six months notice.  Fox declined to comment. James Murdoch declined to be interviewed for this article. What is clear is that some key investors seem to be warming to the idea that James has the chops to run Fox. That was not always the case.  In interviews, some top investors who know James, and other people familiar with the company, describe him as curious and a risk taker like his father. But they also cite two big differences that they like: James is less sentimental about certain assets than his dad and he is more enthusiastic about courting shareholders. In 2013, James and his older brother Lachlan, 43, were elected as directors of Fox – but only on the strength of votes  cast by the family. Assuming the Murdoch family and Alwaleed voted for the two sons (the prince has previously said he tends to vote with the Murdochs), it means that 71 percent of the rest of the shareholders voting opposed James – and 90 percent cast their votes against Lachlan. In contrast, after James was made co-COO and Lachlan co-chairman of Fox last year, only 24 percent of the independent stakeholders voting opposed both their board nominations if the same voting assumptions for the family and Alwaleed are correct.  Fox declined to comment on those assumptions. James “really works hard just like his father,” said Saad Mohseni, chairman and CEO of the Afghan media company Moby Group, in which Fox holds a stake. “He doesn’t get the benefit of the doubt. For him, every step of the way he has to prove himself.” If James gets Carey’s role he will be running the day-to-day operations of a sprawling media behemoth with a market value of close to $73 billion. It owns cable assets, broadcast networks and movie studios, including Twentieth Century Fox movie studio, Fox News and Star India. The Murdochs own 39 percent of voting shares in Fox and News Corp, the company that operates newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and book publisher HarperCollins, through a family trust. Fox split from News Corp in 2013. The prospect of a Fox completely run by the Murdochs does still concern some investors. Many shareholders say they have great respect for Carey, 61, a long-time Murdoch lieutenant who has worked in the role since 2009. The thinking: Carey is not only a good operator but he also keeps the family in check  - especially when acquisitions are concerned. “We are very happy with how things are now,” said one top Fox shareholder, adding that having the Murdochs running the show in the top three positions without having anyone to provide an alternative voice wasn’t a comfortable prospect. A Harvard drop out, James spent his early career as a cartoonist and co-founder of hip hop label Rawkus Records, which was bought by News Corp. He joined News Corp in 1996, at the age of 23 and was soon installed as head of the company’s Asian assets, including Star India. Four years later, he was named CEO of BSkyB, now known as Sky, that is 39 percent owned by Fox. People close to James said one of his weaknesses was that he wasn’t humble about getting big roles at the company from such an early age. He never quite accepted that he only got those jobs because he was Rupert’s son, said one of these people. Still, they said James has now matured and that while he may have been brash at times when he was younger he was successful in improving the group’s businesses in Asia and Europe.  By far the biggest setback James faced was when he was in charge of News Corp’s British newspapers and he had to deal with the phone hacking scandal at its UK tabloid newspaper The News of the World, which was closed as a result. Some of the paper’s journalists were alleged to have illegally tapped phones and bribed officials in pursuit of stories.  While the alleged hacking occurred before James took charge, his critics said he failed to recognize the significance of the problem and didn’t conduct as thorough an internal investigation as necessary. In one oversight, he admitted he didn’t fully read an email sent to him in 2008 detailing allegations against the paper that were made by the English soccer players union. However, a British parliamentary committee cleared James of any wrongdoing and the U.S. Department of Justice declined to prosecute News Corp and Fox after an investigation. James left London for New York in 2012.  For the past three years, James has worked with Carey and other Fox executives to learn about the U.S. media market and repair the damage to his reputation. He has started to emerge at industry functions like the annual media mogul confab in Sun Valley and as a keynote speaker at industry conferences.  One person who knows the family said that Rupert has been indifferent to investors his entire career. “James is more sensitive,” this person said. Rupert Murdoch has often been perceived to do what he likes, especially as it concerns acquisitions, several investors said. One example that is often raised is News Corp’s $5.6 billion purchase in 2007 of Dow Jones, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, an investment that was later written down by half.  Several sources say James played a key role in the decision not to make a hostile bid for Time Warner last year. He assured investors that Fox was going to be cautious on how fast and how aggressive it would be in its pursuit of Time Warner, fearing that it could overpay.  He was instrumental in last year’s consolidation of its European pay-TV assets that led to BSkyB buying Fox’s stakes in Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia, resulting in a new pan-European pay TV company Sky according to people familiar with the matter. Along with those big investments he was also involved in some of Fox’s digital investments in the next generation of advertising and TV viewing, including the purchase of a 5 percent stake in Vice, the acquisition of True [X], which helps broadcasters sell digital advertising, and an investment in Roku, the streaming video player, sources said. “Every time I look behind me or I look ahead of me, I see James,” said David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications. Prince Alwaleed even says if James had been at the helm he could have prevented one of the Murdoch empire’s most embarrassing stumbles - News Corp’s failure to develop MySpace after buying the social media site in 2005.  “MySpace would now be flying,” Alwaleed said, “and there would be no Facebook today.”  ",4212015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twenty-first-fox-jamesmurdoch-insight/with-a-princes-backing-james-murdoch-may-soon-ascend-at-fox-idUSKBN0NC0CR20150421

146,FOX,"Fox says U.S. cable customers like bundles, pay-TV strong","(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) President Chase Carey said on Wednesday “a vast majority of customers want a bundle of channels” rather than to cherry pick networks, an option cable providers are increasingly offering in the face of declining subscriptions. Carey, who is also co-chief operating officer, made the remarks during a quarterly earnings call after Fox posted a 1.2 percent rise in adjusted revenue, helped by growth in its cable network business and the box office success of “Taken 3” and “Kingsman: The Secret Service.” Letting consumers choose what networks they would like to pay for “a la carte” rather than a pricey cable subscription that includes hundreds of channels is a trend that is pitting cable providers and networks against each other. Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is the latest distributor to challenge the traditional pay-TV universe when it launched in April a new slimmed-down package of channels with the option to add on genres such as sports, kids or news.  Fox, along with Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBC Universal, said Verizon’s service violates their contracts that allow Verizon to carry their networks. Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) ESPN went so far as to sue Verizon. Carey did not address Verizon’s service directly on the call.  He said the pay-TV ecosystem is strong, but also acknowledged that video streaming products are important and that Fox is considering offering them. Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said third-quarter revenue rose $6.84 billion from $6.76 billion when adjusted for the sale of its European pay-TV assets Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland AG to Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in November. Analysts were expecting revenue of $6.89 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At its cable networks, which includes the Fox News Channel and Fox Sports 1, revenue increased 14 percent to $3.6 billion on strong affiliate fees. The company’s television unit, which includes the Fox Network, suffered from weak ratings and a 7 percent decline in advertising revenue. Overall revenue for the unit fell 22 percent to $1.2 billion. During year-ago quarter, Fox broadcast the Super Bowl, which helped boost TV results. Twenty-First Century Fox owns movie studios including Twenty Century Fox whose revenue for the quarter rose 5 percent to $1.2 billion.

Verizon Communications Inc is the latest distributor to challenge the traditional pay-TV universe when it launched in April a new slimmed-down package of channels with the option to add on genres such as sports, kids or news. Fox, along with Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal, said Verizon’s service violates their contracts that allow Verizon to carry their networks. Walt Disney Co’s ESPN went so far as to sue Verizon. Carey did not address Verizon’s service directly on the call. He said the pay-TV ecosystem is strong, but also acknowledged that video streaming products are important and that Fox is considering offering them. Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said third-quarter revenue rose $6.84 billion from $6.76 billion when adjusted for the sale of its European pay-TV assets Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland AG to Sky Plc in November. Analysts were expecting revenue of $6.89 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At its cable networks, which includes the Fox News Channel and Fox Sports 1, revenue increased 14 percent to $3.6 billion on strong affiliate fees. The company’s television unit, which includes the Fox Network, suffered from weak ratings and a 7 percent decline in advertising revenue. Overall revenue for the unit fell 22 percent to $1.2 billion. During year-ago quarter, Fox broadcast the Super Bowl, which helped boost TV results. Twenty-First Century Fox owns movie studios including Twenty Century Fox whose revenue for the quarter rose 5 percent to $1.2 billion. Net income attributable to shareholders fell to $975 million, or 46 cents per share, in the third quarter ended March 31, from $1.05 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.

149,FOX,Rupert Murdoch to hand Fox CEO title to son James,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch, the 84-year old media baron, will hand over the chief executive reins at entertainment conglomerate Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to his 42-year-old son James, a source familiar with the situation said on Thursday. Fox Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey will step into an advisory role as part of a generational shift at the parent company of Fox News and movie studio behind “X-Men” and other series, the source said, adding that James Murdoch and his 43-year-old brother Lachlan would work as partners.  The elder Murdoch, whose media career spans the better part of a century, will take on the role of executive chairman, according to published reports.  While New York-based James will have day-to-day control of the company, Lachlan, who will be moving from Sydney to Los Angeles, will play an integral role as the company’s co-executive chair.  The wheels of this partnership were set in motion when Fox announced the brothers’ promotions - Lachlan to non-executive co-chairman of both Fox and publishing operation News Corp and James to co-chief operating officer of Fox together with Carey - in March 2014.  This will be the first time that only Murdoch family members will occupy the top three positions at the company.  Fox said on Thursday it would take up the succession issue at its next board meeting, which the source said would take place next week. CNBC reported earlier that the elder Murdoch would still have the final say in whatever transpires at Fox. It was unclear whether the reorganization would take place this year or at the start of 2016, CNBC said.  “The most important thing in the immediate term is that Chase Carey not leave,” said Needham & Company Inc analyst Laura Martin. “Wall Street really cares about Chase Carey running this business. So if the implication of Rupert handing the title to his son is that Chase Carey leaves in the near term, we would expect that to negatively impact the stock prices.” As of April, the Murdochs owned 39 percent of voting shares in both Fox and News Corp, which operates newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and book publisher HarperCollins, through a family trust.  Fox split from News Corp in 2013. A Harvard University dropout, James spent his early career as a cartoonist and co-founder of hip hop label Rawkus Records, which was bought by News Corp. He joined News Corp in 1996 at 23 and soon ran the company’s Asian assets. He was later named CEO of BSkyB, now known as Sky, that is 39 percent owned by Fox. Some key investors have been warming to the idea that James has the ability to run Fox, describing him as curious and a risk-taker like his father.  They also cite two big differences that they like: James is less sentimental about certain assets than his father is, and more enthusiastic about courting shareholders. The reported executive moves were not surprising, but their timing is, Cowen & Co analysts said in a note to clients, noting that Fox could soon cut earnings estimates. That could set a new, lower bar for a new chief executive to target. “We have always viewed Rupert as an empire builder who is more concerned with accumulating assets than with delivering shareholder returns, highlighted most recently by the aborted attempt to take over Time Warner,” the Cowen analysts said.  Time Warner thwarted an $80 billion advance by Fox last year, in part by denigrating the non-voting stock that Rupert Murdoch was offering. Big acquisitions have long been standard operating procedure for Murdoch, who took an Australian newspaper chain and turned it into a global media superpower, buying storied properties such as the Times of London, The Wall Street Journal and Fox.  He has also been no stranger to controversy with a baldly partisan approach at holdings from Fox News to the New York Post and a sometime role as political kingmaker.

152,FOX,"James Murdoch, Harvard dropout, steps into limelight at Fox","(Reuters) - James Murdoch, a Harvard drop out, former cartoonist and co-founder of a hip hop music label, did not always appear destined to follow his father as a media baron, but he will take the CEO job at Twenty-First Century Fox Inc with backing from some important investors. Passing the torch to his eldest sons, Rupert Murdoch plans to hand the Fox CEO job to James and elevate James’s older brother Lachlan to co-chief executive chairman, a person familiar with the matter said. Murdoch, 84, will be executive chairman and is likely to retain an active role. But James, 42, is “calling the shots as CEO and James is the one who has got recent operational experience,” Cowen and Company analyst Doug Creutz said. Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a family supporter and Fox investor who described James as a “giant” in previous comments to Reuters, described him as grasping the digital world, understanding how it is transforming the media landscape. Investors often say that James is more enthusiastic about courting shareholders while being less sentimental about assets than his father, who built an empire starting with newspapers and was widely seen to have overpaid for Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. “One might expect him to be a little bit more adventurous in terms of acquisitions, especially on the international and digital fronts where he seems to be quite engaged,” said S&P; Capital IQ analyst Tuna Amobi. James did a good job running Britain’s dominant pay TV-provider BSkyB, and since he moved to New York in 2012 he has improved his reputation on Wall Street, Amobi added. The hip hop record label James began as a young man, Rawkus Records, was bought by News Corp, the company that later split into publishing arm News Corp and television and movie-making arm Fox. The scion joined News Corp in 1996, at the age of 23. Over the years he was particularly lauded for his work as CEO of BSkyB, now known as Sky, as it became a pan-European operation. Investors were particularly impressed with his role in spearheading Fox’s digital investments include the purchase of a 5 percent stake in Vice, the acquisition of True X, which helps broadcasters sell digital advertising and an investment in Roku, the streaming video player, sources said. The biggest setback to his reputation likely was as head of News Corp’s British newspapers. In that role, he was criticized with failing to adequately respond when journalists at The News of the World were alleged to have illegally tapped phones and bribed officials in pursuit of stories. But a British parliamentary committee cleared James of any wrongdoing. A big remaining question is how James will work with his brother, Lachlan, in what the source familiar with the matter described as a partnership, and whether the family will prosper without the help of a strong outsider in the executive ranks.  Well-regarded Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey is expected to step down from the role, a departure that analysts at MoffettNathanson called “unfortunate”. Some analysts said they had been happy to have an outsider with Chase’s experience in one of the top jobs at Fox. What’s clear, said Cowen’s Creutz, is that founder Rupert Murdoch had decided it was time to pass the baton.  “I think Rupert will have a say, but I think it is James’s company to run now,” he said.

154,FOX,UPDATE 2-Australia's unprofitable Ten Network plans stake sale to News Corp's Foxtel,"* Ten would join Foxtel in sports rights bid * Competition regulator will consider level of shareholding - Sims * Regulator blocked another TV-Foxtel partnership in 2012 * TV advertising industry weak   (Adds ACCC chairman comment) By Byron Kaye SYDNEY, June 15 (Reuters) - Unprofitable Australian television broadcaster Ten Network Holdings Ltd said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in itself to the local cable TV arm of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, in a lifeline deal that may face regulatory snarls. Ten, which warned in April that it may not survive a downturn in free-to-air advertising, said on Monday the shares will be offered at A$0.15 each, a 43 percent discount to its closing price on Friday. The A$77 million ($59 million) from the sale will be used to cut debt, it said, and added that it wants to raise another A$77 million with a rights issue. But Australia’s chief antitrust regulator said a partnership with Foxtel, the cable TV firm half-owned by News Corp and Telstra Corp Ltd, could enable Ten to outbid larger free-to-air rivals Seven West Media Ltd and Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd for prized sports broadcasting rights, raising concerns about anti-competitive behaviour. “It’s certainly an issue and we have those concerns but one has to take into account the level of the shareholding,” Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims told Reuters. In 2012, Sims blocked Seven from buying half of Foxtel’s sports unit, citing concerns that it would lessen competition for sports rights. Sims then warned that he would stop News Corp from buying free-to-air TV assets for the same reason. Sims said a Ten-Foxtel tie-up might not raise the same level of concern because it involved News Corp taking a smaller stake in Ten than Seven had proposed three year years ago. Ten, which already has News Corp co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch among a host of high profile major shareholders, has consistently rated last behind Seven and Nine, and in 2014 appointed Citibank to help it decide its future amid reports of several takeover approaches. But the weak advertising market is affecting all three free-to-airs. Seven and Nine have watched their revenues decline in 2015 as more viewers switch to streaming video offerings from the newly-launched local arm of Netflix Inc, as well as to their own video streaming ventures. Ten said it expects to take three months to obtain regulatory clearance so the sale would take place in October. Its shares fell as much as 6 percent after the announcement, but recovered to be trading down 2 percent at A$0.26, while the broader market was down 0.4 percent. Ten shares last traded at the proposed deal price of A$0.15 in 1993.

155,FOX,Chase Carey to stay at Fox to advise newly promoted Murdoch sons,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) Chase Carey will remain at the company for another year to support James and Lachlan Murdoch in their new positions running the media company. The company’s board on Tuesday promoted James to chief executive and his brother, Lachlan, to executive co-chairman, while naming Carey executive vice chairman. Rupert Murdoch, who controls Fox through a trust that owns 39 percent of the voting shares, will become executive co-chairman. He previously also held the title of CEO, a role he is giving to James. The management changes take effect on July 1. The elevation of James, 42, and Lachlan, 43, has long been expected, and both brothers will now effectively take on  Carey’s duties. Fox said that all corporate functions including the company’s TV and film divisions will report jointly to James and Lachlan.  While James and Lachlan are said by company sources to have a good relationship and approach the business as partners, the duel-reporting line could prove to be confusing to management. Carey confirmed he is staying with the company to help support the Murdoch brothers. That will no doubt calm some investors, who want the highly regarded executive and a non-family member to remain with Fox.  Carey, 61, has been the company’s president and chief operating officer since 2009 and will serve as its executive vice chairman through June 30, 2016, when his contract ends. Shareholders have warmed to the idea of James and Lachlan taking a bigger role with Fox. In 2013, the vast majority of independent investors did not vote for James and Lachlan as directors.  The tide turned in 2014 when only 24 percent of independent stakeholders opposed the board nominations of James and Lachlan. “It has always been our priority to ensure stable, long-term leadership for the company, and these appointments achieve that goal,” Rupert Murdoch, 84, said in a statement.  “Lachlan and James are each talented and accomplished executives and together, we, as shareholders and partners, will strive to take our company to new levels of growth and opportunity at a time of dynamic change in our industry.” James is currently co-chief operating officer and Lachlan is currently co-chairman.

Dow Jones, which has about 5,000 employees worldwide, will close bureaus in Prague and Helsinki and cut jobs in bureaus in Europe and Asia, Gerard Baker, editor-in-chief of Dow Jones and the WSJ, said in a staff memo seen by Reuters on Thursday. “The company has not given us a firm number of the positions cut yet,” Timothy Martell, a representative of the Independent Association of Publishers’ Employees, told Reuters. Fewer than 30 jobs could be cut on Thursday but the number could touch 100 in the months to come, Martell said.

Revenue from News Corp’s news and information business, which accounts for about 65 percent of overall revenue, declined 9 percent to $1.35 billion in the latest quarter. The company, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has been diversifying into other areas, most notably digital real estate services. Dow Jones was not immediately available for comment.

162,FOX,"News Corp must face Dial, Heinz ad monopoly class action - judge","(Reuters) - News Corp (NWSA.O) has been ordered by a Manhattan federal judge to face a class action lawsuit accusing it of monopolizing the market for in-store promotions at some 52,500 retail stores across the United States. U.S. District Judge William Pauley said consumer packaged goods companies such as Dial Corp, H.J. Heinz Co [HJHC.UL] and Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] may pursue their antitrust claims as a group, potentially boosting overall damages. News Corp spokeswoman Laura Adams said the company, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is reviewing Thursday’s decision. The litigation is part of a long-running battle over News Corp’s marketing operations. In January 2010, the New York-based company agreed to pay $500 million to end rival Valassis Communications Inc’s [VCII.UL] antitrust lawsuit over the newspaper coupon market. News Corp has an estimated 80 percent of the U.S. market for in-store promotion services, where it acts as a middleman to help companies promote goods through coupon dispensers, electronic signs, end-of-aisle displays and shopping cart ads. The plaintiffs said News Corp has monopolized this market since 2004 by locking up exclusive long-term contracts with retailers. They said this anticompetitive conduct has forced them to pay artificially high prices to promote such goods as Dial-brand soap, Heinz ketchup and Smithfield’s Eckrich hot dogs. In certifying a class action from April 5, 2008, to the present, Pauley rejected News Corp’s arguments that damages would be too hard to measure. He noted that the plaintiffs’ damages expert estimated overcharges of 31 percent to 43 percent in the 2008-13 period. The judge also said “central questions regarding liability” for alleged supra-competitive prices were “susceptible to common proof” that could be addressed in a single trial. John Briody, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to comment. Pauley said Valassis is News Corp’s only remaining competitor in the in-store promotion services market. Valassis has also accused News Corp of unfairly dominating that market, and is suing the company in Detroit federal court. Heinz is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and Brazil’s 3G Capital, and plans to merge as soon as next month with Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O. Smithfield was bought in 2013 by the Chinese company now called WH Group Ltd (0288.HK). Dial is a unit of Germany’s Henkel & Co (HNKG_p.DE). The case is Dial Corp et al v.

165,FOX,James Murdoch says family is united as he takes helm of Fox,"CANNES (Reuters) - James Murdoch, who will take the helm of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) next week, said there was little he and his father Rupert did not agree on with respect to the future of the family media empire. At the Cannes Lions advertising conference on Thursday, the 42-year-old executive also said his relationship with brother Lachlan, who will be elevated to a co-executive chairman in the recently announced reshuffle was “very much a partnership”.  While James and Lachlan are said by company sources to have a good relationship and approach the business as partners, the dual-reporting line could prove to be confusing and a source of tension, analysts have said. “The family is obviously a big shareholder in the business, so we are all really invested in each others’ success,” said Murdoch. “We all see very eye to eye on the business, so I think we’re in reasonably good shape there.” Rupert Murdoch, who controls Fox through a trust that owns 39 percent of the voting shares, announced the long-expected elevation of his sons this month as he prepares the future of the company at a time of wrenching change in the television and entertainment businesses.  James Murdoch will soon be running a sprawling media empire that owns cable assets, broadcast networks and movie studios, including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox News and Star India. Fox is also the largest shareholder in European pay-TV group Sky PLC (SKYB.L) with 39 percent.   The family spun off the newspaper business News Corp. (NWSA.O), long a passion of Rupert Murdoch, into a separate company in 2013. Some investors have questioned whether James is less attached to some parts of the media empire that his father built, such as the less profitable newspaper arm. The future of Fox’s investment in Sky is also an issue after media reports of interest from European media group Vivendi (VIV.PA) and telecom operator Vodafone (VOD.L) James Murdoch did not comment on Thursday on those topics in particular, but did not mention News Corp. or Sky when asked what he thought the most promising areas of development were for the company. “We are a global business and have always been so but I have to say we think India is the single greatest opportunity in the next five to ten years,” he said, adding that Latin American and the United States were also bright spots. Asked whether he would one day like his own children to run the family business, Murdoch laughed.  “My kids are really little right now. I’d just like them to pass the fifth grade.” ",6252015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twenty-first-fox-murdoch/james-murdoch-says-family-is-united-as-he-takes-helm-of-fox-idUSKBN0P51HW20150625

Ailes has been with the company since 1996 and oversaw the creation and launch of Fox News Channel, which currently reaches more than 90 million homes. He was made chairman of Fox Television Stations Group in 2005, a few months after Lachlan — seen as the heir apparent — resigned as deputy chief operating officer of News Corp.

But Fox’s adjusted profit beat Wall Street expectations and the company said it would buy back $5 billion Class A shares over the next 12 months. Fox’s shares were down marginally in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Adjusted revenue, which excluded the sale of the company’s direct broadcast satellite television businesses, fell to $6.21 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $6.41 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue in Fox’s film studio business fell by a third to $1.91 billion as no major titles released in the quarter. The year-ago quarter was driven mainly by the success of “X-Men: Days of Future Past” and the animation film “Rio 2”. The company in the next few months is slated to release movies such as “Fantastic Four” and sci-fi sequel “Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials”. Fox recorded the lowest ratings among the Big Four broadcasting networks in the 2014-2015 television season, according to Nielsen data. This was reflected in the 4.3 percent decline in the company’s television revenue in the fourth quarter. Revenue in its cable network programming business rose 6.6 percent to $3.57 billion, boosted by coverage of NASCAR and ICC Cricket World Cup sporting events. The business accounts for more than half the company’s total revenue.

Chief Executive Robert Thomson said on a call with analysts that the company was in the final phase of talks with a potential acquirer for the business. “We and most investors had basically written off Amplify,” Macquarie Research analyst Timothy Nollen told Reuters.

175,FOX,Rebekah Brooks returning to News Corp as UK chief: FT,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rebekah Brooks will return to her old job heading Rupert Murdoch’s British newspaper division, the Financial Times reported, just over a year after being cleared of criminal charges in a phone-hacking scandal. Her return to News Corp could be as soon as early September, the Financial Times said on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.  Reuters reported in March that Brooks, the former editor of the News of the World tabloid and seen as Murdoch’s protege, was in talks about returning to News Corp. “As we ‎have said, we have been having discussions with Rebekah Brooks and when we have any announcements to make we will let you know,” a News Corp spokesman said on Friday. News UK, which covers Murdoch’s British newspaper titles, declined further comment. If confirmed, the return to one of the biggest jobs in the British media would mark a stunning turnaround for Brooks who became one of the most talked about figures in British public life when the phone-hacking scandal broke. A public inquiry which ran through 2011 and 2012 heard of the close ties between senior executives at Murdoch’s newspapers, the police and leading politicians, including Prime Minister David Cameron. Many admitted ‎they had got too close to Brooks as the revelation of regular gatherings at country homes gave the impression of a close knit establishment that had failed to hold itself to account. The investigation into what went wrong at the papers is also not complete. British prosecutors said on Friday they had received evidence relating to the phone-hacking investigation at the media baron’s newspapers and were considering a possible corporate prosecution. Brooks rose in 14 years from the most junior newsroom position to edit Britain’s biggest selling newspaper. She was a good friend of the last three British prime ministers, including Cameron, and was often pictured by Murdoch’s side. She quit in July 2011 amid revelations that News of the World staff had hacked into the phones of thousands of people to break news. Evan Harris, a former British lawmaker and executive director of Hacked Off, a campaigning group for higher standards in journalism, said Brooks’ return would not be acceptable in any other company. If confirmed, the return of Brooks could also ‎cause consternation amongst the victims of phone hacking. They told the court and the public inquiry how they felt hounded by the press and unable to trust anyone after private conversations appeared in the newspapers. As part of her defence, Brooks explained that she had had to work her way up through aggressive, male dominated newsrooms and often felt out of her depth as she was quickly promoted. Prosecutors charged that if she had not known about hacking in her newsroom, then she must have been incompetent. The scandal started in 2006 when the former royal editor of News of the World, Clive Goodman, and his investigator Glenn Mulcaire, admitted they had hacked the phones of royal aides. As revelations grew, police launched a wider investigation in 2011 under the code name Operation Weeting that led to the jailing for 18 months of the paper’s ex-editor Andy Coulson. Brooks was arrested and charged with being part of a conspiracy to hack into phones to find exclusive stories, of authorising illegal payments to public officials and of trying to hinder the police investigation.  She denied all the charges and was found not guilty in June 2014 after an eight-month trial.

Prosecutors charged that if she had not known about hacking in her newsroom, then she must have been incompetent. The scandal started in 2006 when the former royal editor of News of the World, Clive Goodman, and his investigator Glenn Mulcaire, admitted they had hacked the phones of royal aides. As revelations grew, police launched a wider investigation in 2011 under the code name Operation Weeting that led to the jailing for 18 months of the paper’s ex-editor Andy Coulson. Brooks was arrested and charged with being part of a conspiracy to hack into phones to find exclusive stories, of authorising illegal payments to public officials and of trying to hinder the police investigation. She denied all the charges and was found not guilty in June 2014 after an eight-month trial.

Of the total, 524,000 were ages 25 to 54, the key group for advertisers on cable news. Sean Hannity’s show “Hannity” delivered its highest-rated month ever, both among 25-to-54-year-olds and in total viewers. It drew 1.8 million viewers overall. The Republican debate on Aug. 6 pulled in 24 million viewers, the biggest audience in the history of the Fox News Channel. Other major news events during the month included the stock market plunge and a shooting in Virginia.

181,FOX,Murdoch favorite Brooks returns to UK job in remarkable comeback,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rebekah Brooks, the Rupert Murdoch protegee cleared last year of orchestrating a criminal campaign that damaged the British establishment, will return to her old job running the tycoon’s British newspapers next week in a stunning comeback. Brooks, who worked her way up from the lowest rung on a newsroom ladder to become one of the most influential people in Britain, will resume oversight of the Sun and The Times of London papers on Monday following a high-profile fall from grace four years ago.  With sales at the brash Sun tabloid in decline and a weak online presence, Brooks is being brought back to breathe new life into the group.  She will be joined by Tony Gallagher as Sun Editor in Chief - a respected journalist and a key figure in the success of MailOnline, one of the most popular websites in the world.  “I am delighted to return to News UK,” said Brooks, who was dubbed by some as Murdoch’s “fifth daughter”. “It is a privilege to be back amongst the most talented journalists and executives in the business.”     Her return was condemned by critics of the company who questioned Murdoch’s judgment in bringing back one of Britain’s most vilified journalists who was once depicted as a witch on the front page of a news magazine over her role in a phone hacking scandal.  Chris Bryant, an opposition lawmaker who has been an arch opponent of News Corp’s aggressive tactics, said the 84-year-old Murdoch was “sticking two fingers” up to the British public by reappointing Brooks.  The 47-year-old quit in 2011 after the News of the World tabloid she had once edited admitted hacking into thousands of phones to generate stories, including the phone of a murdered schoolgirl. The admission sparked an uproar that rocked Murdoch’s media empire, forcing the closure of the 168-year-old tabloid and a televised questioning in parliament of the Australian-born tycoon and his son James, both of whom apologized. The case cost the firm millions of pounds while a year-long public inquiry also exposed the close ties between senior News Corp executives including Brooks, the police and leading politicians including Prime Minister David Cameron. As the scandal engulfed his company and lawmakers who once sought his blessing lined up to criticize his firm, Murdoch showed his loyalty to Brooks by tipping her, its chief executive, as his main concern. “This one,” he said, when asked for his top priority. Brooks was found not guilty of conspiring to hack into phones, bribing public officials for stories and perverting the course of justice following an eight-month trial which itself became front-page news. As part of her defense, Brooks explained that she had had to work her way up through aggressive, male-dominated newsrooms and often felt out of her depth as she was quickly promoted.  Back in her old job, she will have to tackle the slide in sales of the Sun, Britain’s biggest-selling newspaper and work with Gallagher, currently deputy editor at the Daily Mail and a former Telegraph newspaper editor, to build a stronger digital presence.  Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Brooks’ return would be awkward for politicians who had previously acknowledged they had become too close to her when she was at the height of her powers. “It’s another reason for questioning the judgment of Murdoch himself, because he must surely appreciate the political embarrassment caused at the time by her and those close to her,” he said.

182,FOX,Australian antitrust chief questions Murdoch play for Ten Network,"SYDNEY, Sept 14 (Reuters) - A proposal by Rupert Murdoch’s cable TV firm Foxtel to buy 15 percent of struggling broadcaster Ten Network Holdings Ltd may hurt competition, an Australian antitrust regulator said, in a sign that it may block the A$77 million share sale. Failure to clinch a deal would require loss-making Ten to recommence its search for a financial lifeline as it trails larger rivals Seven West Media Ltd and Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd in the ratings and as more free-to-air viewers opt for streaming services like Netflix Inc. A key sticking point is the TV rights to big sporting events. Although Australian law prevents pay TV companies from buying exclusive broadcast rights to certain sports matches, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is worried that the proposal by Foxtel, of which Murdoch’s News Corp  owns half, may make Foxtel less willing to negotiate with other TV networks. The deal “may increase the likelihood of Ten and Foxtel entering into joint bids and other commercial arrangements for acquisition of sports rights, to the exclusion of other free-to-air networks”, ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement on Monday. Ten said in a statement that it believes the proposal will increase competition in relevant markets. The ACCC noted that Murdoch’s son, Lachlan Murdoch, owns 8.5 percent of Ten and is executive co-chairman and a likely shareholder of News Corp, saying “if the interests of Foxtel and Mr Murdoch are aligned, this would be in effect the largest shareholding block in Ten”. The regulator will make a final ruling on Oct. 22. Ten shares climbed above Foxtel’s proposed 15 cent acquisition price, rising 1 cent to 17.5 cents. The stock is still down a third from a June 12 peak.

192,FOX,CORRECTED-Fox News guest analyst arrested for lying about working for CIA,"(Corrects corporate parent in paragraph 5 to 21st Century Fox, instead of News Corp) By Ian Simpson WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A Fox News guest terrorism analyst was arrested on Thursday after a grand jury indicted him on charges of falsely claiming to have been a CIA agent for decades, U.S. prosecutors said. Wayne Simmons, 62, of Annapolis, Maryland, bogusly portrayed himself as an “Outside Paramilitary Special Operations Officer” for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1973 to 2000, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Virginia’s Eastern District said in a statement. Simmons allegedly tried to use that claim to get government security clearances and work as a defense contractor. At one point he was deployed overseas as an intelligence adviser to senior military officers, the statement said. He faces charges of major fraud against the United States, wire fraud and making false statements to the government. He has appeared on Fox News, a unit of 21st Century Fox Inc , as a guest analyst on terrorism since 2002 and has a wide presence among conservative groups, a profile on Amazon.com said. Fox News spokeswoman Carly Shanahan said Simmons had been a guest on the network and had not been paid. The indictment said that Simmons falsely claimed on national security forms that his previous arrests and convictions were related to his CIA work and that he had held a top secret security clearance. The indictment also alleged that Simmons defrauded a victim out of about $125,000 through a bogus real estate investment. The Amazon.com profile said he worked in anti-narcotics operations and in 2004 was part of Pentagon program for military and intelligence analysts. He is co-author of the thriller “The Natanz Directive.” Simmons is a contributor to the conservative publication Human Events, the profile said. He also spoke at a 2013 forum sponsored by the Citizens Committee on Benghazi probing the deaths of four Americans in Libya in 2012. The CIA said in a statement that it was working closely with the Justice Department on the matter. It referred queries to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

The deal would give News Corp exposure to property markets of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong just as Australian real estate advertisers like REA brace for a downturn at home following several years of double-digit growth. In a statement on Monday, REA Group said it plans to pay A$4 per share for the 77.3 percent of iProperty that it does not already own, giving the target company a market capitalisation of A$751 million. iProperty would recommend the deal in the absence of a better offer. iProperty shares jumped as much as 11 percent in a weaker overall market to A$3.90, their highest since March 2014. REA shares rose 1.3 percent. Douglas Loh, a portfolio manager at Acorn Capital, iProperty’s third largest shareholder with 4.7 percent, said the offer was below the target company’s share price 20 months ago and that the acquisition would benefit REA by giving access to new growing markets. “If you believe in the growing Asia story and high adoption of mobile and Internet platforms and so on, there’s significant potential being able to integrate the two together,” Loh said, adding that he will rely an independent expert report to decide whether to accept the offer. REA said it was advised by Citigroup Global Markets Pty Ltd on the deal, which will be put for a shareholder vote in January.

198,FOX,"'Fantastic Four,' strong dollar weigh on Fox's revenue","(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as a lack of major movie releases and poor collections from “The Fantastic Four” weighed on its film studio business and a strong dollar hurt overseas results. Fox shares fell nearly 3 percent to $30.34 in morning trading after the company released results from its first full quarter under Chief Executive Officer James Murdoch, who took over from his father, Rupert, on July 1. Revenue from the filmed entertainment business, which accounts for nearly a third of the company’s total, fell 28 percent to $1.79 billion in the first quarter ended on Sept. 30 from a year earlier. The drop reflects the weak performance of superhero film “The Fantastic Four” and difficult comparisons with the year-earlier period, which included successes such as “Dawn of the Planet of Apes” and animated animal comedy “Rio 2.” Fox, which gets more than a third of its revenue from abroad, took a hit of more than $100 million from the effects of the stronger dollar this year, Chief Financial Officer John Nallen said on a conference call. Cable network programming, which includes the Fox News, FX network and National Geographic channels, was a bright spot. Its revenue rose 7.2 percent to $3.46 billion, boosted by coverage of the first Republican candidates’ debate, which drew a record 24 million viewers.  Sports channels and Fox News ratings also helped drive the unit’s domestic advertising revenue up 4 percent. Weak ratings and one less week of National Football League broadcasts for the television unit, which includes the Fox Network, led to a 5 percent decline in advertising revenue there. Overall revenue in the business was flat at $1.05 billion. Net income attributable to shareholders fell to $675 million, or 34 cents per share, from $1.04 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-earlier numbers include Fox’s direct broadcast satellite television business, which the company has since sold. Adjusted for the sale, Fox’s revenue fell 6.3 percent to $6.08 billion, below the analysts’ average estimate of $6.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

199,FOX,"UPDATE 2-'Fantastic Four,' strong dollar weigh on Fox's revenue","(Adds details on ad revenue and CFO quote, recasts paragraph 1 with “Fantastic Four,” update stock price) By Malathi Nayak and Sai Sachin R Nov 4 (Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc  reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as a lack of major movie releases and poor collections from “The Fantastic Four” weighed on its film studio business and a strong dollar hurt overseas results. Fox shares fell nearly 3 percent to $30.34 in morning trading after the company released results from its first full quarter under Chief Executive Officer James Murdoch, who took over from his father, Rupert, on July 1. Revenue from the filmed entertainment business, which accounts for nearly a third of the company’s total, fell 28 percent to $1.79 billion in the first quarter ended on Sept. 30 from a year earlier. The drop reflects the weak performance of superhero film “The Fantastic Four” and difficult comparisons with the year-earlier period, which included successes such as “Dawn of the Planet of Apes” and animated animal comedy “Rio 2.” Fox, which gets more than a third of its revenue from abroad, took a hit of more than $100 million from the effects of the stronger dollar this year, Chief Financial Officer John Nallen said on a conference call. Cable network programming, which includes the Fox News, FX network and National Geographic channels, was a bright spot. Its revenue rose 7.2 percent to $3.46 billion, boosted by coverage of the first Republican candidates’ debate, which drew a record 24 million viewers. Sports channels and Fox News ratings also helped drive the unit’s domestic advertising revenue up 4 percent. Weak ratings and one less week of National Football League broadcasts for the television unit, which includes the Fox Network, led to a 5 percent decline in advertising revenue there. Overall revenue in the business was flat at $1.05 billion. Net income attributable to shareholders fell to $675 million, or 34 cents per share, from $1.04 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-earlier numbers include Fox’s direct broadcast satellite television business, which the company has since sold. Adjusted for the sale, Fox’s revenue fell 6.3 percent to $6.08 billion, below the analysts’ average estimate of $6.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

201,FOX,News Corp's revenue falls for third straight quarter,"(Reuters) - News Corp, owner of the Wall Street Journal, reported its third straight quarter of revenue decline, hurt by a strong dollar and lower print ad sales, mainly in Australia. The company, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said on Thursday revenue from its news and information business fell about 11 percent to $1.29 billion in the first quarter.  The business, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of its total revenue, has been struggling for the past few years as readers shift to digital media and newspapers’ advertising revenue slides. Still, print and digital advertising revenue at Dow Jones, whose flagship publication is the Wall Street Journal, grew in the first quarter. “We really think it was a good quarter, in line with what they had guided ... knowing that they are in this transformative period,” said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management, which owns about 3.9 million shares of News Corp. The company - whose revenue is largely dependent on its newspaper holdings in the United States, Australia and the UK - has been diversifying its business to lower its dependence on print. Revenue at the company’s digital real estate services business, which includes U.S. website realtor.com and a stake in Australian REA Group, jumped 70.5 percent to $191 million. The net income available to the company’s stockholders rose to $175 million, or 30 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $65 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier.

204,FOX,Laurene Powell Jobs backs Amplify education company bought from News Corp,"(Reuters) - Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs, is the lead investor who funded the buyout of News Corp’s money losing digital education business Amplify earlier this year. A representative for Powell Jobs’ organization, the Emerson Collective, confirmed the investment in Amplify but would not specify how much of the company Powell Jobs would own or the amount paid for it.  The company’s top management, including its new Chief Executive Larry Berger, picked up a minority position in the Brooklyn-based company as part of the deal. Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp said Sept. 30 that it had sold Amplify to a management team backed by a group of private investors for an undisclosed sum. The identity of the investors was not revealed at the time. Murdoch, News Corp’s chairman, has been an outspoken critic of weaknesses at U.S. public schools. News Corp poured hundreds of millions of dollars building the educational technology unit. As part of News Corp, Amplify introduced a digital curriculum program for middle school students in 2014. It also rolled out a tablet device to school districts, an effort that was later shut down.  In August, News Corp took a charge of $371 million related to the business. More than 500 employees lost their jobs after the sale. Former New York City schools chancellor Joel Klein, who helped plan the buyout and was the previous CEO, will have a board seat.

208,FOX,U.S. investigates broadcasters in widening FIFA case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A sports marketing company that was described in a sweeping indictment this month as retaining contracts because of the “support” of corrupt soccer officials has longstanding ties to the U.S. entertainment company 21st Century Fox, according to securities filings and other government documents. The description of T&T; Sports Marketing Ltd in the indictment signals that U.S. prosecutors have intensified their focus on media companies and what they might have known about any bribes, people familiar with the matter said. When prosecutors announced their corruption investigation of world soccer’s governing body FIFA in May, they spoke in court papers about “an array of broadcasters and advertisers” but otherwise did not specifically address their role. 21st Century Fox listed T&T; as a subsidiary last year in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Its investment in the company stretches back to 2002, government documents from the United States and Argentina showed. Fox had no operational control of T&T;, a Fox spokeswoman said. She declined to comment further. Fox was not named in the indictment and was not accused of any wrongdoing. T&T; was also not accused of any wrongdoing. T&T;, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, does not have a listed telephone number and it was unclear if it has employees of its own. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, where the cases against top soccer officials and entities were brought, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the FBI also declined to comment. The Dec. 3 indictment said three executives “affiliated” with T&T; bribed at least 15 high-level soccer officials to support the company’s exclusive worldwide broadcasting rights for events such as the Copa Libertadores, a major South American club tournament. The three executives were at the time with Argentine sports marketing firm Torneos y Competencias, the indictment said. One of the three executives, Alejandro Burzaco, the former chairman of Torneos, was indicted for the bribery scheme in the United States in May and pleaded guilty last month. The two others were described in the indictment as co-conspirators but not named. Torneos, a part-owner of T&T; with Fox, was not charged. The 15 soccer officials have been charged, and two of them pleaded guilty last month. The indictment does not explain how T&T; benefited from retaining the broadcasting contracts. T&T; is not a broadcaster itself, but by obtaining broadcasting rights, it could resell them to major broadcasters. 21st Century Fox, which is led by media baron Rupert Murdoch, ended up with the rights to broadcast the Copa Libertadores and other tournaments. The avalanche of corruption allegations prompted FIFA President Sepp Blatter to say he would resign, only days after being re-elected to a fifth term. Batter has not been charged with a crime, and denies any wrongdoing. Prosecutors have charged 41 people and entities in a probe of soccer corruption spanning the globe. Soccer bosses from throughout the Americas are among the defendants in a case that prosecutors said involves $200 million in bribes and kickback schemes tied to marketing of major tournaments and matches. The schemes deprived soccer federations of the full value of broadcasting and marketing rights and had powerful anti-competitive effects, prosecutors said. Media companies could potentially be criminally liable if they benefited from bribery and their employees had knowledge of it or were willfully blind to it, legal experts said. Emails, text messages and other documents, as well as interviews with cooperating witnesses, are typically used to assess what if anything employees knew and when. Mere ownership in a subsidiary or affiliate involved in bribery would not be enough, however, for prosecutors to charge a major media company. There would need to be evidence the company knew or was willfully blind. According to the indictment, T&T; was owned in part by Argentina’s Torneos and in part by “a group of investors that included an affiliate of a major broadcasting company headquartered in the United States whose identity is known to the grand jury.” The description does not go beyond that. Today, only two companies own shares in T&T.; A Fox affiliate owns 75 percent and Torneos owns 25 percent, according to Torneos. Fox’s relationship with T&T; dates back to 2002, when the company joined forces with Liberty Media Corp and a subsidiary of private equity firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst to form a venture called Fox Pan American Sports. As part of the deal, Hicks transferred its 50 percent stake in T&T; to the new venture, according to government documents from Argentina. Fox completed its takeover of Fox Pan American Sports in late 2011, according to U.S. securities filings. A Liberty Media spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the deal. Hicks is defunct. Satellite-TV company DirecTV also has an interest in T&T;, according to a securities filing in February. It owns 40 percent of Torneos, which in turn owns 25 percent of T&T;’s shares. DirecTV said in August that its $147 million investment in Torneos could be hurt by the ongoing FIFA investigations. DirecTV is a unit of AT&T; Inc, which declined to comment on the case. Torneos also declined to comment. Fox has chosen the law firm Williams & Connolly to conduct an internal review related to the soccer investigation, people familiar with the matter said. The scope of the review could not be determined. Brendan Sullivan, a partner at the firm who represented Murdoch’s News Corp in the British phone-hacking scandal, could not be reached for comment.

The 84-year-old executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc and Hall, 59, became engaged in Los Angeles, where they had been attending Hollywood’s Golden Globes awards ceremony on Sunday, the London newspaper reported. The three-times-married media tycoon and Hall - who is also a former actress and was the longtime romantic partner of Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger - began dating last summer after being introduced by one of Murdoch’s sisters and his niece while in Australia, the Times said. Murdoch, a native of Melbourne, Australia, and Hall, who hails from Gonzales, Texas, were first photographed together at the Rugby Union World Cup Final in London in October. “They have loved these past months together, are thrilled to be getting married and excited about their future,” a Murdoch family spokesman told the Times. The announcement, published in the paper’s Births, Marriages and Deaths section, read: “Mr Rupert Murdoch, father of Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan, James, Grace and Chloe Murdoch, and Miss Jerry Hall, mother of Elizabeth, James, Georgia and Gabriel Jagger, are delighted to announce their engagement.” The newspaper did not say whether the couple had announced a date for their nuptials. Murdoch divorced his third wife, Wendi Deng, a former executive at Murdoch-owned Star TV in China, in 2013 after 14 years, saying their marriage had been irretrievably broken. (reut.rs/1OYm3n6) In addition to the Times, Murdoch’s News Corp newspapers include the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and the Sun in Britain. Murdoch also controls 21st Century Fox,  which owns cable networks like Fox News and movie studios. Hall was married to Jagger for more than 20 years. However, in divorce proceedings in 1999, the British musician claimed they were never legally married. Before her relationship with Jagger, she had dated British pop star Bryan Ferry, front man of the band Roxy Music. On Twitter on Tuesday, “Jerry Hall” was one of the top-trending terms in Britain after news of the engagement broke. Many Twitter users expressed surprise, calling the Hall-Murdoch pairing an unusual match, and some indulged in snark. “So, Jerry Hall, what first attracted you to billionaire ... No, actually, I still don’t understand it,” tweeted actor David Schneider (@davidschneider).

214,FOX,"James Murdoch, who quit in phone-hacking scandal, returns to Sky","LONDON (Reuters) - James Murdoch is to return as chairman of Sky (SKYB.L) four years after a phone-hacking scandal forced him out, potentially taking the Murdoch family a step closer to a deal for full ownership of the European pay-TV group. Murdoch built Sky into a powerhouse in four years as chief executive officer and five as chairman, and was on the verge of selling it to U.S. media group 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), owned by his father Rupert, before the scandal engulfed him. His appointment, seven months after becoming chief executive of Fox, follows Rebekah Brooks’ return to lead Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper business last year after being cleared of charges over the scandal at the News of the World newspaper, where reporters hacked into phones to obtain stories while she was the editor.  Murdoch’s return to a top job at Sky had seemed a remote possibility when he stood down in 2012, with politicians lining up to denounce the family for its domination of the British media and Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledging that politicians had got too close to his father Rupert.  “It’s like Murdoch’s getting the band back together, it’s as if nothing ever happened at all,” said a former executive from Murdoch’s British arm. The admission of phone hacking, including the mobile phone of a murdered schoolgirl, led to a criminal trial, a national inquiry into media standards and a political backlash that forced Fox to abandon its bid for Sky. Rupert Murdoch closed the News of the World in 2011. In James Murdoch’s absence, Sky bought Fox’s German and Italian businesses, rolling Murdoch’s European pay-TV assets into one company with 21 million customers and a London listing. It is 39 percent owned by the U.S. group. Buying all of Sky, which reported a better-than-expected 12 percent rise in profit and a record number of new customers on Friday, would add Europe’s biggest pay-TV group to a media empire that spans U.S. network TV, Asia’s Star and one of the most famous production businesses in the world.  Recent results have shown that American TV networks are starting to struggle as viewers shift to online services such as Netflix (NFLX.O).  Sky’s Chief Executive, Jeremy Darroch, said Murdoch, who was the only candidate put forward, was “without a doubt the right man for the job”, underlining his deep knowledge of the international media industry and experience on the board. He acknowledged there would be speculation about Fox’s intentions, but said Sky’s management would not be distracted. “I can’t speak for Fox but what I would read into James’ acceptance of the role is that he and they continue to be passionate supporters for Sky’s ongoing success,” he told reporters. The younger son of the media tycoon, now 43, quit as the chairman of the-then BSkyB in 2012, brought down by his link to the newspaper business which he was running at the time.  Having returned to New York, he rebuilt his career at Fox. He will replace Nick Ferguson, who has been chairman of Sky since 2012 and on the board for 12 years, at the end of April. In his absence, Sky lost no momentum in Britain and Ireland, where its product innovation, slate of programming and marketing prowess have countered the threat from new rival BT (BT.L). Operating profit hit 747 million pounds ($1.1 billion) for the six months to end-December, ahead of the 727 million pounds expected by analysts according to a company-supplied consensus. It added 337,000 new customers in the second quarter, with strong growth in both TV and broadband and its highest numbers of new customers in its biggest UK and Ireland market for 10 years. Shares in Sky were trading up 2.5 percent at 1,067 pence at 0933 GMT, valuing the group’s equity at 18.35 billion pounds.  Jeff Li, co-fund manager of the New Capital fund at EFG Asset Management which is a Sky investor, said shareholders were likely to welcome Murdoch’s return. “We think he’s demonstrated enough skill over the years in management, plus the Murdochs have the knack of repeatedly creating value for shareholders to not do anything rash,” he said. “As an investor in 21st Century Fox as well, we always consider it a real possibility for Fox to fully take over Sky at some point.” Another investor, Royal London Asset Management, described the appointment as inappropriate.  “Should Fox make a bid for Sky, investors need a strong independent chairman to protect the interests of minority shareholders and negotiate the best possible deal,” said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at RLAM.

Newspaper and magazine publishers have been under unabated pressure to offset a decline in print advertising dollars by shoring up their digital business to attract advertisers and by boosting subscriptions. News Corp, controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, said revenue at its news and information unit declined 8.1 percent in the second quarter. The unit, which accounted for about 65 percent of total revenue, also houses Dow Jones and the New York Post. Here, ad revenue fell 12 percent, mainly due to weakness in print ads. The company said digital revenue increased and accounted for a third of total ad revenue at Dow Jones. It did not provide numbers. “News Corp is a company with a lot of opportunities in front of it and a lot of ways to leverage its assets. This particular quarter shows that’s still a work in process,” said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management, which owns about 3.9 million shares of News Corp. News Corp, which split off from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc in 2013, has been diversifying to rely less on its print business. The company said it expects its fast growing digital real-estate unit, where revenue jumped 35 percent, to become a core pillar of profitability. Revenue in its book publishing business, which includes HarperCollins Publishers, fell 5 percent. The company sold more printed books in the quarter, but not enough to offset the fall in e-book sales, a softness felt by other publishers also, Chief Executive Robert Thomson said on a conference call. The company’s total revenue fell 4.3 percent to $2.16 billion in the quarter. Analysts were expecting revenue of $2.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue also took a $141 million hit from foreign currency fluctuations, primarily from a weak Australian dollar. In Australia, where Murdoch was born, News Corp’s ad revenue declined 26 percent and the company said it was taking steps to streamline costs at newspapers, which includes the Australian and the Sunday Mail. News Corp’s net income available to shareholders fell 56 percent to $62 million. Its adjusted profit of 20 cents per share missed analysts’ estimates of 21 cents. The company’s shares were unchanged at $12.21 in extended trading. ",2042016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-news-corp-results/news-corps-revenue-falls-for-fourth-quarter-in-a-row-idUSKCN0VD2S8

220,FOX,UPDATE 1-Lions Gate says to explore combination with Starz,"(Reuters) - Movie and TV studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGF.N said on Thursday it would explore a combination with media mogul John Malone’s premium cable TV network Starz STRZA.O. The studio behind the Hunger Games franchise also reported a 2.31 percent stake in class A shares of Starz and a 26.26 percent stake in its class B shares. Los Angeles Times, citing sources, reported in October that Lions Gate was in advanced talks to merge with Starz. The two companies have not been able to come to terms over valuation, according to several reports. Starz’s rival movie channel Epix, which Lions Gate co-owns with Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) and MGM, also remains a bone of contention in the deal’s closing, LA Times had reported. Lions Gate’s stake represents about 14.7 percent of the voting power in Starz, which makes TV shows such as “Outlander” and “Da Vinci’s Demons”. Starz was spun off from Malone’s Liberty Media Corp LMCA.O in 2013. Since then there have been reports the company has been in merger talks with Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O), CBS Corp (CBS.N) and AMC Networks Inc (AMCX.O). Malone is a member of Lions Gate’s board and reported a 3.3 percent stake in the company in November.

221,FOX,Fox revenue misses on lackluster DVD sales,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, mainly due to a decline in DVD sales from a year ago, when “X-Men: Days of Futures Past” and “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” were released for home viewing. The company’s shares were down about 2.5 percent in after-hours trading on Monday. Revenue from Fox’s filmed entertainment business fell about 14 percent to $2.36 billion in the second quarter, accounting for nearly a third of the company’s total revenue. Fox said DVD sales were hit by the weak performance of “Spy”, a comedy starring Jason Statham and Melissa McCarthy, offsetting strong box-office collections of Oscar-nominated “The Martian”. The company’s cable network business, which includes the Fox News and National Geographic channels, was a bright spot. Revenue at the business rose 9.4 percent to $3.70 billion, boosted by strong viewership for NBA games and Republican presidential debates. That helped the company meet profit estimates for the quarter ended Dec. 31. Excluding special items, the company earned 44 cents per share from continuing operations, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total net income attributable to shareholders fell to $672 million, or 34 cents per share, in the quarter, from $6.21 billion, or $2.88 per share, a year earlier. The year-ago quarter included Fox’s direct broadcast satellite television business, which the company has since sold. Adjusted for the sale, Fox’s revenue fell marginally to $7.38 billion in the quarter from $7.42 billion a year earlier, below the average analyst estimate of $7.51 billion.

224,FOX,Storyful editor to join Facebook to manage journalism partnerships,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The managing editor of News Corp’s social media news agency Storyful said on Wednesday she is leaving to manage journalism partnerships at Facebook Inc	, as the social network broadens its push into news.  Aine Kerr said in a blog post on Storyful’s site that she would leave later this month. She linked her announcement to a separate post from Storyful Chief Executive Rahul Chopra who announced her departure, as well as the appointment of Mandy Jenkins as head of news, and Joe Galvin as director of news. ""I leave so excited about the possibilities for journalism, for the role Facebook plays as a source of valuable, newsworthy content, but also as a destination with the largest online audience in the world and advertising revenue models to match,"" Kerr wrote. (here#.VruXqflVhBe) Facebook did not respond immediately to requests for comment on Wednesday. Facebook has pushed to include more news on its site, including a change to its algorithm to surface higher-quality and more relevant news. It also launched last year Instant Articles, a partnership with nine news publishers that lets them publish articles directly into the News Feed, rather than directing users to another website that has a slower load time.   Founded in 2010 and based in Dublin, Ireland, Storyful finds and verifies social media content for its clients so that the content can be trusted for use in print.  Kerr joined Storyful in 2011, according to her post. Prior to becoming managing editor, she was political editor and head of content at the agency, which News Corp acquired in 2013.  Her former boss, Storyful founder Mark Little, left last year to join Twitter Inc.

225,FOX,Media tycoon Murdoch hails Cameron ally for wanting Britain to leave EU,"LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch congratulated a close ally of Prime Minister David Cameron on Saturday for wanting to campaign to leave the European Union in an upcoming referendum. Cameron hailed a landmark deal he said gave Britain “special status” in the European Union and pledged to campaign heart and soul to stay in the EU at a referendum expected in June. But he acknowledged that one of his closest political allies, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, would campaign to leave the EU, saying he was disappointed but not surprised. He suggested other Conservatives may also join the “out” camp. “Congratulations Michael Gove,” Murdoch said on Twitter.   “Friends always knew his principles would overcome his personal friendships.” The message from the 84-year-old executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc raises the possibility that some of the media tycoon’s British newspapers could campaign for an EU exit. Previous editors of Murdoch’s Sun tabloid, the country’s biggest selling newspaper, have said they sometimes reflected Murdoch’s opinions in the paper on major issues such as which political party to back at elections. Murdoch had previously used the social media network to call Cameron’s renegotiation with the EU a “non-deal”, adding “Now he’s rumoured to be begging cabinet colleagues to put aside beliefs.” Murdoch’s News Corp newspapers include the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and the Sun and the Times in Britain.

226,FOX,REFILE-UPDATE 2-Verizon redesigns its Fios Custom TV offering,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc, which launched its pay TV plan “Fios Custom TV” last year to let viewers choose bundles of channels they want to watch, has redesigned the offering. The revamped Custom TV now offers a choice of one of two packages with over 100 channels and three optional genre-specific packs, instead of a slim offering of 36 channels plus numerous genre-specific add-ons.   The move was not in response to objections from content partners but based on customer feedback, a Verizon spokesman said.   The first package, named “Essentials,” has over 190 channels, including the big four U.S. networks - Disney’s ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC with no sports offerings.  The second package, “Sports & more,” has more than 160 channels, including ESPN and regional sports, plus non-sports channels such as the Cartoon Network. In April last year, Verizon repackaged the traditional pay-TV bundle and created a stir with some programmers by moving some traditional pay TV base-tier channels into optional genre-specific add-on packs. The channels it moved included ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp division NBC Universal’s USA. ESPN has sued Verizon, alleging a breach of contract, while Twenty-First Century Fox and NBC Universal have said the Custom TV offering violates their contractual obligations.  ESPN is “encouraged by the changes that Verizon has made to Custom TV,” spokeswoman Katina Arnold said. She declined to comment on ESPN’s lawsuit against Verizon.       FOX and NBC could not be reached immediately for comment. The offering now costs $69.99, along with Fios Internet and digital voice services and three genre-specific add-on packages for $6 each. The first Custom TV iteration started at $65 a month for broadband, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, from a choice of seven for $10 each. The growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate.   Last month, Verizon’s Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo declined to comment on the ESPN lawsuit on an earnings call with investors, but said customers “don’t want to have to pay for bundles that they never use.” “We will refresh (Custom TV) here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements,” he added. Compared to pay-TV giants AT&T; Inc with its DirecTV acquisition last year and Comcast, Fios has a small market in 12 states and Washington, D.C., with 5.8 million video customers as of the end of 2015.

227,FOX,News Corp faces U.S. trial over monopoly of in-store ads,"NEW YORK, Feb 29 (Reuters) - News Corp went to trial on Monday in a class action lawsuit that accuses the company of monopolizing the market for in-store promotions at some 52,500 retail stores across the United States. Jury selection got underway in federal court in Manhattan in an antitrust lawsuit filed by consumer packaged goods companies including Dial Corp, Kraft Heinz Foods Co and Smithfield Foods Inc. The lawsuit claims News Corp has monopolized the U.S. market for in-store promotion services, where it acts as a middleman to help companies promote goods through coupon dispensers, electronic signs, end-of-aisle displays and shopping cart ads. The plaintiffs said News Corp, which is controlled by billionaire Rupert Murdoch, has dominated this market since 2004 by locking up exclusive long-term contracts with retailers. By 2009, the plaintiffs said News Corp controlled 90.5 percent of the market. In 2014, its sole remaining competitor, Valassis Communications Inc, abandoned the business, according to court papers. The plaintiffs said News Corp’s anti-competitive conduct forced them to pay artificially high prices to promote such goods as Dial soap and Heinz ketchup. It’s unclear from court records how much in damages News Corp could face. While the plaintiffs had until recently been seeking damages that could reach $2.5 billion if tripled by a federal judge under U.S. antitrust law, pre-trial rulings have recently limited News Corp’s potential liability. News Corp has denied the plaintiffs’ allegations, and says it has “acted lawfully at all times, and caused no harm to competition or the competitive process.” The litigation is part of a long-running battle over News Corp’s marketing operations. In January 2010, the New York-based company agreed to pay $500 million to end rival Valassis’s antitrust lawsuit over the newspaper coupon market. The case is Dial Corp et al v. News Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-06802.

In 2014, News Corp’s last rival, Valassis Communications Inc , abandoned the business, according to court papers.

235,FOX,Exclusive: T. Rowe Price to oppose key directors at super-voting share companies,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - T. Rowe Price Group Inc plans to vote against key directors at companies with two classes of shares in the upcoming U.S. corporate annual meeting season, as the big asset manager steps up its push against companies that give extra voting clout to insiders. Major U.S. corporations from Viacom Inc to Facebook Inc have classes of shares that give founders, CEOs and other insiders extra influence, creating a long-running debate over the balance of power between them and outside investors. The change in policy has not been reported. Portfolio managers can vote counter to the policy, where warranted, the asset manager said. Still, the change at one the largest publicly traded fund firms, with $763 billion in assets under management at the end of last year, sends a message to boardrooms and could boost efforts by activists to equalize voting rights at some established companies. At Viacom, investors are calling for controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone to end a dual-class structure, saying it insulates leaders from investor pressure. Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch maintains his influence at Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and News Corp thanks to a similar structure, as do the founders of Google parent Alphabet Inc. In all, more than 10 percent of companies in the Russell 3000 Index have unequal voting of shares, according to FactSet. Donna Anderson, head of T. Rowe Price’s corporate governance efforts, said the Baltimore-based company adopted the new policy last month after becoming alarmed by the rising number of initial public offerings with dual-class structures, mimicking the larger companies. Proponents of new rules say outside investors should have an equal vote in corporate decisions, while backers of dual-class structures say they help ensure that founders and other trusted leaders can plan for the long term - and that outside investors understand the rules when buying shares. There were no immediate signs that other big fund firms would make a similar change. A spokeswoman for Vanguard Group said it had no plans to change its voting policies to follow T. Rowe Price’s lead. A spokesman for BlackRock Inc declined to comment on the matter and Fidelity Investments did not immediately return a request for comment. T. Rowe Price and other fund firms have backed efforts for change before, but the new policy specifically focuses on directors the company has backed in the past.  “To just endorse their re-election every year sends the wrong message,” Anderson said in an interview this week.  Under the new policy, at dual-class U.S. companies with unequal voting rights, T. Rowe Price funds now will vote against lead independent directors, or independent chairs, and all nominating and corporate governance committee members.  While the new policy may not determine whether directors are re-elected, T. Rowe Price’s size means the change will “make those directors take notice,” said Laura Campos, director of shareholder activities for the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which has pressed News Corp to end its dual-class structure. Since August, a half-dozen IPOs have included unequal voting rights, according to FactSet, including dating website operator Match Group Inc and digital payments company Square Inc.  Shareholder resolutions calling for companies to give all shares an equal vote also have gained ground. At Ford Motor Co such a proposal received 36 percent support in 2015, up from 19 percent support in 2009, according to Manhattan Institute data.  On March 14 a vote on a similar advisory proposal will be held at Viacom. The proposal is not expected to pass as Redstone still controls a majority of the media company’s voting stock.

236,FOX,Ex-TV commentator Tobin Smith settles SEC penny stock fraud case,"(Reuters) - Tobin Smith, a former Fox News commentator, will pay nearly $258,000 to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he fraudulently promoted a penny stock to investors, the regulator said on Tuesday. The SEC said Smith and his investment research firm NBT Group Inc agreed in May 2012 to tout publicly traded IceWEB Inc, as part of a scheme by the data storage company’s chief executive to inflate its trading volume and stock price. Smith and NBT did not fully disclose their compensation and incentive fees to investors, and made false and misleading statements intended to boost IceWEB’s stock price, including that it was the “perfect” technology stock and that Facebook Inc was a customer, the SEC said. According to the regulator, the promotional campaigns continued for a few months after the unexpected May 25, 2012 death of IceWEB’s chief executive, John Signorello.     As part of the settlement, Smith and NBT agreed to give up $182,793 of improper payments and interest and be barred from future penny stock offerings, and Smith agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, the SEC said. Neither admitted wrongdoing. Smith, in a phone interview, said IceWEB asked him to continue promoting the stock after Signorello’s death. “We inaccurately disclosed some of the variable compensation to which we could have been entitled, and should have disclosed it more accurately,” he said. Smith contributed to Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network for 13 years before his contract was terminated in June 2013 over the promotion of another stock, the SEC said. The Fox stations are owned by Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, and were not defendants in the case. IceWEB is now called UnifiedOnline Inc, and was also not a defendant, the SEC said.

News Corp, controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the owner of the Wall Street Journal and publisher HarperCollins, took its grievance to the European Commission two years ago. It said Google’s practice of aggregating content on its home page and exploiting its dominance in online advertising undermines the business model of content providers such as News Corp. “News Corp has broadened its existing complaint,” the person said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. The source said the new elements included Google’s practice of copying or scraping content from other sites and also promoting its own news search results above rival sites.

Diosdado Cabello filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court against News Corp, the newspaper’s owner, and alleged that the May 2015 article contained “false and defamatory allegations” that he was involved in criminal activities related to drug trafficking and money laundering. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from News Corp and its Dow Jones subsidiary, which was also named as a defendant. Dow Jones spokeswoman Colleen Schwartz said in a statement that it would “vigorously defend” itself against the lawsuit and that it had “full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting.” According to the lawsuit, the story has caused “enormous damage to Mr. Cabello’s reputation and good name, both personally and in his capacity as a key member of Venezuela’s National Assembly.” The lawsuit comes as U.S. authorities including federal prosecutors and the Drug Enforcement Administration investigate to what if any extent Venezuelan officials have facilitated drug trafficking. In the article of May 18, 2015, headlined “Venezuelan Officials Suspected of Turning Country into Global Cocaine Hub,” the Wall Street Journal reported that Cabello was a leading target in the investigations. Cabello, the No. 2 figure in Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party, is a member of the country’s National Assembly, which he presided over from January 2012 to January 2016. Cabello has repeatedly denied any involvement in Venezuela’s drug trade, and told Venezuela’s parliament last year that “it would never occur to us to get involved in something that would hurt young people.” In his lawsuit, Cabello said the newspaper had inaccurately represented quotes from unnamed sources and falsely stated that he was the probe’s “biggest target.” The case is Cabello-Rondon v.

248,FOX,"News Corp's quarterly revenue falls 7.3 percent, posts loss","(Reuters) - News Corp (NWSA.O), owner of the Wall Street Journal and book publisher HarperCollins, reported its fifth drop in quarterly revenue in a row as print ad sales declined and a strong dollar hit income from outside the United States. The 7.3 percent fall in revenue was worse than analysts had expected, but the company’s shares were flat after-hours. News Corp reported a net loss available to shareholders of $149 million, or 26 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with a profit of $23 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier. The company was hurt by a one-time charge of $280 million at its News America Marketing business. News Corp said in February it had agreed to pay that amount to resolve claims that it monopolized the market for in-store promotions at more than 50,000 retail stores across the United States. Excluding items, the company earned 4 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue fell to $1.89 billion from $2.04 billion,  missing the average estimate of $1.93 billion. News Corp, which gets more than half of its revenue from outside the United States, said “currency fluctuations” reduced revenue by about $72 million in the quarter. Revenue in the company’s news and information division fell 9 percent to $1.23 billion. Apart from the Journal, the division includes the New York Post and Dow Jones Newswires as well as the Times and the Sun in the UK and newspapers in Murdoch’s native Australia. It also contains the News America Marketing business, a provider of advertising services through publications and in-store promotions. Revenue in the company’s book publishing business, which includes HarperCollins Publishers, fell 11 percent to $358 million. However, revenue in News Corp’s fast-growing online real estate services business, which includes website realtor.com, rose 14 percent to $194 million.

A Fox News representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Carlson claimed in the lawsuit that Ailes took her off the popular morning show “Fox & Friends” in 2013, cut her pay and placed her in a less desirable afternoon time slot because she refused to have a sexual relationship with him. The lawsuit was filed in New Jersey state court. She also claimed in the lawsuit that Ailes called her a “man hater” and that he criticized her for getting offended when she had confrontations with male coworkers including former co-host Steve Doocy. Carlson, 50, said she was fired on June 23. She is seeking damages for lost compensation, damage to her career and mental anguish. A former Miss America, she joined Fox News in 2005. The lawsuit accused Ailes of retaliating against Carlson by firing her and before that “ostracizing, marginalizing and shunning her after making clear to her that these ‘problems’ would not have existed, and could be solved, if she had a sexual relationship with him.” Fox News Channel is a subsidiary of 21st Century Fox .

262,FOX,UPDATE 2-Sky says investment in products and content will keep revenue motoring,"LONDON (Reuters) - European pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L) said a twin focus on product innovation and top-class sport and entertainment would help deliver a better-than-expected rise in revenue in the year ahead after it reported 12 percent higher full-year profit. Sky, in which Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) owns 39 percent, has been seeking to earn more money from existing customers through new products and price rises instead of chasing new subscribers with cut-price offers.  Rival BT (BT.L), Britain’s biggest telecoms group, also updated the market on Thursday, saying demand for broadband boosted its first-quarter earnings, which include a first contribution from mobile operator EE. The two companies have been playing to their strengths — premium TV content for Sky and broadband for BT — while selling extra products to existing customers.  Sky’s shares had their best rise in nearly three years, up as much as 7.3 percent. The stock was trading 2.6 percent higher at 911.5 pence at 1326 GMT, while BT shares were 3.4 percent higher at 416 pence.  Analysts at Citi said Sky’s results “should be greeted with relief” as investors had been worried about the company failing to keep customers or add enough new ones. Churn - the percentage of customers leaving - rose to 11.2 percent in the fourth quarter, at the higher end of analysts’ expectations. Sky’s Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said he was “actually very happy” with the churn rate, saying it had risen with its growing proportion of broadband-only customers who were more likely to switch suppliers. He also said a number of cut price offers that had boosted subscribers were ending. Analysts at stockbroker AJ Bell, however, said Sky had a customer loyalty problem on its hands. “The broadcaster has historically tried to keep the level below 10 percent, but clearly its recent decision to put up TV prices and limit retention discounts hasn’t gone down well,” they said. The “Game of Thrones” broadcaster added 808,000 customers and 3.3 million new products across its operations in Britain and Ireland, Germany and Austria, and Italy in the year. “We are continuing to invest in the areas that really matter for customers, whether that’s on screen in the very best content, in new product innovation or in delivering the very best customer service,” Darroch said. Sky said it expected revenue growth of 5-7 percent, topping market forecasts of 5 percent, in the year to end-June 2017. It also increased expected cost savings from the integration of Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia to 400 million pounds by 2020, from 200 million by 2017, and said it would separately reduce costs by 2-3 percent of sales next year.  The savings, analysts said, would help offset higher costs for Premier League soccer. Sky’s revenue rose 7 percent to 11.97 billion pounds, beating forecasts of 11.75 billion, with adjusted operating profit broadly in line with forecasts at 1.56 billion pounds. BT reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 1.82 billion pounds in the three months to the end of June, compared with a company-supplied analyst forecast of 1.78 billion pounds. “This is a good start to the year, I think it’s ahead of consensus on all the key metrics,” said BT’s Chief Executive Gavin Patterson. BT, which is in talks with telecoms regulator Ofcom about restructuring to improve national broadband coverage, said in May it expected to produce core earnings of around 7.9 billion pounds for the year.

Sky, in which Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox  owns 39 percent, has been adapting its business in recent quarters, seeking to earn more money from existing customers through new products instead of chasing customer group as before. On Thursday the group said its revenue in the year to June 30 rose 7 percent to 11.97 billion pounds ($15.78 billion), with adjusted operating profit coming in at 1.56 billion pounds. Churn - the percentage of customers leaving - in its biggest UK and Ireland market was 11.2 percent in the fourth-quarter, reflecting in part the growing proportion of broadband-only customers in its base who are more likely to switch suppliers.

268,FOX,Hulu mounts push to draw and keep subscribers: executive,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hulu has beefed up its customer service staff and is hiring executives from outside and within the online video business to slow subscriber defections ahead of the introduction of its live TV service, a top official of the streaming company said. “As we think about that offering of live TV, (viewers) are going to be more important to us than they ever have been,” Ben Smith, a senior vice president and head of experience, said in an interview. Luring and keeping customers is becoming harder as the online streaming market gets more crowded and subscribers, freed from cable television’s contract model, can cancel service with a click of the mouse.    The company, which plans to roll out the new live TV bundle of broadcast and cable network channels early next year, has one of the industry’s highest customer defection rates at 50 percent, according to research firm Parks Associates.  Hulu, which on Wednesday announced the sale of a 10 percent stake to Time Warner Inc, is hiring executives from data-driven companies to better understand who is logging on to watch shows and movies and how they can be converted into long-term subscribers, Smith said. The company has nearly tripled its number of customer service agents to 250 since 2014, Smith said. He personally handles more than 20 subscriber queries every month, he added. Hulu declined to comment on its investment in customer service or the Time Warner agreement. As part of the deal, Time Warner’s channels including TBS, Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies, will be available on Hulu’s upcoming service.  Other Hulu owners are Comcast Corp, Walt Disney Co and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Hulu’s 12 million customers currently watch shows such as “The Mindy Project” on demand for $8 per month with commercials or $12 without them.  A July customer experience study from research firm Forrester said Hulu and Netflix tied for first place among other streaming video services, even ranking higher than cable competitors. Netflix has a 9 percent customer defection rate, according to Parks Associates.  Hulu’s executive hires include Ehren Schlue from Amazon.com Inc in 2014 and Karen Van Kirk from Intuit Inc this year, Smith said.  “As we think about adding live and linear TV into Hulu,” he said, “we know there’s an additional sensitivity that we’ll need to develop both in terms of how we operate Hulu and in how we work with our customers.”  (Rewrites 11th paragraph to show only one hire was new.)

269,FOX,"UPDATE 5-Time Warner takes stake in Hulu, lifts profit forecast","(Reuters) - Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) disclosed a 10 percent stake in video streaming site Hulu on Wednesday, setting its sights on the web TV market, and it raised its 2016 forecast on expectations of sustained growth in its traditional media business.  Time Warner also reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as it signed up more viewers to its premium Home Box Office network. Its shares were up 3.5 percent at $78.40 in afternoon trading.  The company, which also owns the Warner Bros movie studio, is paying $583 million for the Hulu stake, executives said on a conference call. Other Hulu owners are Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O).  Time Warner has been trying to woo younger viewers and push into the online video market dominated by services such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon Prime (AMZN.O). Last year it introduced its own streaming service, “HBO Now,” and made its content accessible on Dish Network Corp’s (DISH.O) Sling TV streaming service, which offers a small bundle of channels.   “They want to ensure that the Turner networks have the broadest possible distribution without really compromising the traditional cable, satellite and telco channels,” said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan.  The investment also gives Hulu additional funding as it prepares to roll out a new live-streaming service, which is slated for early next year. Turner’s networks, including TBS, Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies, will be available live and on-demand on Hulu’s new service, Time Warner Inc said on Wednesday.  The company raised its 2016 earnings forecast by 5 cents a share to a range of $5.35 to $5.45. Analysts on average were expecting $5.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Second-quarter revenue fell 5.3 percent to $6.95 billion from $7.35 billion, mainly due to a decline for the Warner Bros studio.  Revenue from the Turner division rose 6.5 percent during the quarter. Revenue at HBO, which hosts the hit show “Game of Thrones,” was up 2 percent.  Time Warner’s net income fell to $951 million, or $1.20 per share, from $971 million, or $1.16 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding special items, earnings of $1.29 per share beat the analysts’ average estimate of $1.16.

277,FOX,Fox settles sexual harassment lawsuit for $20 million on Ailes' behalf,"(Reuters) - Fox News will pay $20 million to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit by former anchor Gretchen Carlson, whose allegations led to the resignation of network chief Roger Ailes in July, a source familiar with the agreement said on Tuesday. The company also settled with two other women who were part of a Fox-initiated investigation by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Wharton & Garrison, according to the source, who wished to remain anonymous. The settlements come less than two months after Fox News’ parent company, 21st Century Fox, hired Paul, Weiss to investigate claims against Ailes. During that investigation, more than two dozen women described harassment by Ailes, according to New York Magazine.  In a move that legal experts said was unusual, 21st Century Fox offered a public apology to Carlson, who filed suit against Ailes in July, saying he took her off a popular show and cut her pay because she refused to have a sexual relationship with him. “We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve,” the company said. While the settlement removes some uncertainty, observers said questions remain about the conservative news channel’s ability to retain top talent and whether more allegations will surface. Fox News also announced on Tuesday that Greta Van Susteren, host of “On the Record,” was leaving the network after 14 years. A court filing showed Carlson, 50, had voluntarily dismissed her federal lawsuit in New Jersey against Ailes. In a statement, she said she was grateful Fox took swift action. The source said Ailes’ contract indemnified him from employment-related claims, which was why the company was settling on his behalf. Attorneys for Ailes did not return calls for comment. Fox News still is fighting sexual harassment claims in a New York state court. Former anchor Andrea Tantaros claimed she was taken off the air in April in retaliation for rebuffing Ailes’ advances and complaining to top officials at Fox News. Behind the scenes, her lawsuit said, Fox News was “a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny.” Fox News characterized Tantaros as an “opportunist” who was taken off the air for writing a book without permission. The speed with which Fox settled with Carlson suggested it may settle with Tantaros, said Dan Eaton, a San Diego State University business ethics lecturer and employment attorney. Ailes, a former political consultant who founded the conservative news operation in 1996, left Fox less than three weeks after Carlson filed suit, taking a $40 million severance package. Tantaros and other women who had worked for him then came forward with more harassment allegations. Ailes had said Carlson’s lawsuit was in retaliation for the network’s decision not to renew her contract after disappointing ratings for her show. A $20 million settlement is high for a sexual harassment case but not surprising given the high profile of the people involved, said Douglas Wigdor, a New York City employment lawyer who represents employees. “Any settlement is going to take into account how much the (plaintiff) was earning, as well as the notoriety of the person being accused,” said Wigdor, who is not involved in the case.  Fox News, which generated more than $1 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 21st Century Fox in fiscal 2016, is the most watched channel in basic cable television this year, according to Nielsen ratings data.   In his resignation letter, Ailes did not indicate he had done anything wrong. He previously denied Carlson’s allegations, as well as those of star anchor Megyn Kelly. New York magazine reported in July that Kelly had told investigators hired by Fox that Ailes “made unwanted sexual advances toward her” about 10 years ago. Van Susteren’s departure was related to a financial disagreement with her employer, according to a separate source familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity because discussions were confidential. The source declined to say if her departure was connected to Ailes’ resignation.

280,FOX,U.S. FCC chief to unveil revised plan to eliminate cable boxes,"WASHINGTON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The top U.S. communications regulator plans on Thursday to unveil a revised plan to allow about 100 million pay TV subscribers to replace expensive set-top boxes with less-costly apps that provide access to television and video programs, two people briefed on the plan said. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed in January opening the $20 billion cable and satellite TV set-top box market to new competitors and allow consumers to access multiple content providers from a single app or device. The plan, aimed at breaking the cable industry’s long grip on the lucrative pay TV market and lowering prices for consumers, drew fierce opposition from TV and content providers, including AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. The FCC has said Americans spend $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV boxes, or an average of $231 annually. Set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones has dropped 90 percent, the FCC has estimated. The pay TV industry raised concerns over copyright, content licensing and privacy issues and made a counterproposal in June, offering to commit to creating its own apps to allow consumers to watch programs without needing to lease a box. Wheeler’s revised plan is expected to include some components of the pay TV industry’s proposal, and to exempt some smaller cable providers from the new requirements. The plan is also expected to create a licensing body to oversee the pay-TV apps, according to industry filings with the FCC. The revised application-based proposal is expected to come before the five-member commission for a vote on Sept. 29 at the commission’s next meeting, the sources briefed on the matter said. Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for Wheeler, declined to comment. Disney, CBS, Viacom, Time Warner  Inc, Scripps Networks Inc and others met with Wheeler aides last week to discuss “a revised approach... that would ensure that all of programmers’ valuable content would remain inside of, and under the control of, apps developed exclusively by” cable and other pay-TV providers, according to a filing with the FCC this week. These companies fear that rivals like Alphabet Inc  or Apple Inc could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content. Wheeler’s January proposal would create a framework for device manufacturers and software developers to produce a single device or app to gain access to content from providers such as Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Hulu, Alphabet’s YouTube and a pay-TV company. Wheeler has an aggressive agenda in the final months of the Obama administration. He wants the FCC to finalize a proposal to ensure privacy for broadband Internet users by barring providers from collecting user data without consent. He also wants to complete reforms of the $40 billion annual market for business data services known as special access lines.

281,FOX,RPT-UPDATE 1-Motor racing-Formula One faces big shake-up after Liberty deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Formula One faces its biggest shake-up in decades with the announcement on Wednesday that U.S. cable TV mogul John Malone’s Liberty Media has agreed to take control of the cash-generating glamor sport. The deal, which has an enterprise value of $8 billion according to a company statement, heralds a new era for Formula One, a European-dominated sport that has long sought to break into the U.S. market and win fresh audiences. It could also accelerate the exit of 85-year-old Bernie Ecclestone, the Briton who has run the sport for nearly 40 years and built up a business with annual turnover of around $1.9 billion. Liberty Media said in a statement, which ended a long-running saga surrounding the sport’s ownership and potential flotation, that it was acquiring an initial 18.7 percent stake from controlling shareholder CVC Capital Partners.  The company hopes to complete a deal for the remainder by the first quarter of 2017.  The statement added that Chase Carey, the executive vice-chairman of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and a director of Sky News owner Sky Plc, will take over as chairman of the board of Formula One’s parent company with Ecclestone remaining as CEO. “I greatly admire Formula One as a unique global sports entertainment franchise attracting hundreds of millions of fans each season from all around the world,” Carey said.   “I see great opportunity to help Formula One continue to develop and prosper for the benefit of the sport, fans, teams and investors alike.” Ecclestone added that he welcomed the company into the sport and looked forward to working with them.   The deal will be subject to the approval of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), the governing body for Formula One and other global motorsport series, and European anti-trust regulators. CVC acquired majority control of Formula One in March 2006 and has since recouped its money many times over with billions of dollars in revenues. DEAL-MAKER Ecclestone has been the deal-maker, securing lucrative television contracts and hosting fees with countries such as Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan that are eager to feature on what is now a calendar with a record 21 races. A controversial figure, who has become as much a celebrity as any of the drivers, ‘Bernie’ has been a part of Formula One ever since the 1950s. A former team owner, he secured the television rights in the late 1970s and transformed the sport into one of the world’s richest. Reluctant to delegate, he has not groomed a successor and critics have accused him of holding back the sport through a failure to embrace fully new media or the digital marketplace, something Liberty is expected to make a priority. “Maybe it is good news that an American media company buys F1,” Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff said at the weekend’s Italian Grand Prix. “There are things we can learn from the American way, particularly in the digital areas...they will have a close look and then analyze what they think needs to be changed and what needs to remain.”   Team bosses and other paddock insiders expect Ecclestone to be eased out only gradually, given his intimate knowledge of the business. CVC has twice tried to float Formula One but the plans stalled and the fund instead sold stakes to U.S. investment groups BlackRock and Waddell & Reed, along with Norway’s Norges Bank. It sold down its holding from 63 percent in 2012 in deals that at the time gave the business an enterprise value, which includes debt and equity, of $9.1 billion. That left CVC with a 35.5 percent stake in Delta Topco, Formula One’s parent company, with Waddell & Reed having 20.9 percent. Among other investors, Ecclestone holds 5.3 percent and his family’s Bambino Trust another 8.5 percent.

283,FOX,Exclusive: Ecclestone says new F1 owners would want him to stay,"LONDON (Reuters) - Formula One’s commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone has been asked to stay on for three years after an imminent takeover of the sport is completed by U.S. cable TV mogul John Malone’s Liberty Media. “They want me to be here for three years,” the 85-year-old, who over the decades has built the sport into a business with annual turnover of around $1.9 billion, told Reuters on Wednesday. Media reports have suggested the first part of a broader deal between outgoing rights holders CVC and Liberty Media could be announced on Wednesday. However Ecclestone and CVC chairman Donald Mackenzie voiced some scepticism about the time frame at last weekend’s Italian Grand Prix. “Honestly, I don’t think anybody knows — including our friends from Liberty, and Donald,” said Ecclestone, who still  expected the deal to get over the line. The Briton said he would not be attending next week’s Singapore Grand Prix, the social highlight of the sport’s Asian calendar, because of the negotiations. “Because all this is going through, they (CVC) want me to be there (in London) to help them with all sorts of things. I can’t afford to be away for five to six days.” A Formula One board meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday, by which time the deal should have been finalised and a new chairman introduced. Ecclestone expects that to be Chase Carey, executive vice-chairman of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and a director of Sky News owner Sky Plc, who would replace Austrian Peter Brabeck-Letmathe. Brabeck, 71, has been chairman since 2012 but has recently recovered from cancer and is due to step down as chairman of Nestle, the world’s largest food and drink company, in 2017. Ecclestone, famously unwilling to delegate in the past, indicated he would be happy to share the workload. “He (Carey) can do lots of things that I haven’t done with this social media, which he seems to be in touch with. He’s been dealing with sponsorship with his TV people. Between us we’ll get on with it,” he said. Ecclestone’s future had been called into question, with former team owner and television pundit Eddie Jordan saying on Sunday that Monza could even be the Briton’s last race. “That’s Eddie Jordan. If he had any money, and wanted a small wager, I’d give him good odds,” said Ecclestone. BIGGEST SHAKE-UP  The takeover, which values Formula One at more than $8 billion according to media reports, would represent the biggest shake-up in the cash-rich sport for decades. A deal with Liberty would also herald a new era for a European-dominated sport that has long sought to break into the U.S. market and win fresh audiences, with team principals already welcoming the possibility of a bigger push. Liberty Media has interests in the Atlanta Braves baseball team, satellite radio service Sirius XM, entertainment group Live Nation and minority interests in Time Warner and Viacom. Malone’s Liberty Global is the world’s largest international TV and broadband company, operating in more than 30 countries in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean through a series of different brand names. One bump in the road ahead could be the need for the deal to be approved by the sport’s governing International Automobile Federation (FIA) and other global motorsport series, and European anti-trust regulators. The FIA has a one percent stake in Formula One’s parent company Delta Topco, which could be worth around $90 million according to forbes.com, and that has been held up as a possible conflict of interest.  The privately-owned Force India and Sauber teams have also filed a complaint asking EU authorities to investigate the sport’s governance and distribution of revenues. Ecclestone expected the European Commission to take a closer look at the sport as a result. “It’s like the police. You get stopped for a rear light and they want to know if you’ve got a driving license and insurance. So I don’t know what effect that will have,” he said.

284,FOX,"Liberty will not 'Americanise' F1, says Carey","LONDON (Reuters) - The United States can be a big growth area for Formula One but  Liberty Media have no desire to ‘Americanise’ the sport after the U.S. company’s takeover, new F1 chairman Chase Carey said on Thursday. “We didn’t make this move because of America,” he told Sky Sports News the day after Liberty announced a deal, valued at $8 billion including debt, that will give the American media and telecoms business effective control. “America is an opportunity, I think we can do a lot more in America, it’s probably more long-term than short-term,” he added. “Realistically it’s a global sport. We’re not trying to Americanise the sport. We have great respect for the European foundations of it. Europe is critically important to us.” The United States currently has just one round of the 21 race championship at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, after a series of failed attempts to secure a permanent home over the years. However there has been talk of new races on the east and west coasts. Meanwhile, races in the sport’s historic heartland like Britain’s Silverstone, Italy’s Monza and Spa in Belgium have faced uncertain futures as they struggle to pay hosting fees and make a profit. Carey, who joined the sport’s 85-year-old commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone in answering questions, said there was a more passionate fan base in America than people realized even if it took time to build the audience. “Certainly the U.S. is a big opportunity long-term but this isn’t an American company Americanising the sport,” he said. “This is a great global sport and great franchise and one we are just going to continue to build with the things Bernie’s built over the prior decades,” he said. “We want to make it (F1) everything it can be.” Carey, the executive vice-chairman of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and a director of Sky News owner Sky Plc, has been appointed chairman of the board of Formula One’s parent company with Ecclestone remaining as CEO.

That left CVC with a 35.5 percent stake in Delta Topco, Formula One’s parent company, with Waddell & Reed having 20.9 percent. Among other investors, Ecclestone holds 5.3 percent and his family’s Bambino Trust another 8.5 percent.

291,FOX,CORRECTED-Fox News co-presidents signed to long-term contracts," (Corrects attribution of announcement to Fox News) NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fox News said on Wednesday that co-presidents Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine have signed new multiyear contracts, deals that put to rest some uncertainty about the cable channel’s direction after the departure of former Chairman Roger Ailes. The two company veterans were named co-presidents in August after Ailes resigned. Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson sued Ailes in July, claiming sexual harassment. Ailes has denied the charges but Fox News parent 21st Century Fox settled the case on Ailes’ behalf for $20 million on Sept. 6. “Jack and Bill have been instrumental in Fox News’ continued dominance in the ratings and historic earnings performance,” Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, said in a statement. “I am delighted they’ve each signed new deals, ensuring stability and leadership to help guide the network for years to come.” Terms of the contracts were not disclosed. The departure of Ailes, who is credited with turning Fox News into a ratings powerhouse, raised questions about the network’s ability to keep talent and its wide ratings lead over competitors. Lachlan Murdoch, co-executive chairman of 21st Century Fox and Rupert Murdoch’s son, told investors at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch media conference on Wednesday that it would be “foolish” to change Fox News’ strategy.

298,FOX,Almost 30 pct of Sky shareholders oppose James Murdoch as chairman,"LONDON (Reuters) - Almost 30 percent of voting shareholders at Sky SKY.L opposed the appointment of James Murdoch as chairman of the European pay TV group on Thursday, with some saying he was too closely linked to the group’s largest investor, owned by his father Rupert. James Murdoch, who became Sky chairman in January, won 71.55 percent support in a vote to confirm his appointment at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, below the 90-plus percents obtained by other board members.  Sky is 39 percent-owned by Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O).  “Should Fox make a bid for Sky, investors need a strong independent chairman to protect the interests of minority shareholders and negotiate the best possible deal,” said Piers Hillier, chief investment officer of Royal London, which holds 0.35 percent of the shares in Sky. “Additionally no attempts were made to advertise the position externally, or appoint an agency, which goes against the UK corporate governance code.” James Murdoch’s appointment came four years after he was forced out of the same position by a phone-hacking scandal, just as he was on the verge of selling the British company to Fox. He went on to become chief executive of Fox in 2015. “The board decision to reappoint James as chairman was unanimous and recognized that he is a highly experienced executive with extensive knowledge of the international media industry and has been a strong contributor to Sky since he joined the board in 2003,” the company said in a statement. It said the presence of independent directors on the board would protect the interests of independent shareholders. “Nevertheless, we will engage with those shareholders who voted against the resolution,” it added. Earlier on Thursday, Sky reported a 5 percent rise in first-quarter underlying revenue and said it was on track to meet its full-year targets.

Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc aims to table a firm cash bid valuing Sky at 10.75 pounds ($13.66) per share as early as Wednesday for the 61 percent of the British broadcaster it does not already own, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters. “All directors of Sky have a duty not to disadvantage the public shareholders, and the position of the non-executives will need to be robust to ensure that the premium paid is appropriate and that shareholders are not disadvantaged by any temporary low in the share price,” said Kieran Quinn, chairman of Britain’s Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF). The LAPFF represents 71 public sector pension funds managing 175 billion pounds ($222.29 billion) in assets. LAPFF said it wanted to see unspecified “safeguards for future probity given past track records of the businesses controlled by the Murdoch family”. “Further clarity may also be needed so that public shareholders have full confidence that proposals are not being unduly influenced by the well-known relationships between Sky and Twenty-First Century Fox,” it said. “The role of (British communications industry regulator) OFCOM would be helpful in bringing its expert scrutiny on a deal that will have a broader impact on the future of the broadcasting and print media marketplace in the UK,” Quinn added.

317,FOX,Former UK PM Brown calls for Murdoch's Sky deal to be delayed,"LONDON (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged Britain to delay Rupert Murdoch’s proposed deal to buy European pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L) until the government completes an inquiry into a phone hacking scandal, the Guardian said on Wednesday. Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) announced a preliminary deal to buy the rest of Sky it does not already own for $14 billion last Friday, five years after a hacking scandal at one of his tabloid newspapers derailed a previous attempt.   The scandal triggered a year-long public inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press, led by senior judge Brian Leveson, that interviewed former prime ministers, celebrities and public figures.  A second part of the inquiry into specific claims around hacking has not started and the government is consulting the industry on whether it is still in the public interest. Brown said in a statement sent to Reuters that he was calling for the second part of the inquiry to take place but did not mention the bid. “It is clear that, given these questions (about wrongdoing), the Leveson 2 inquiry should take place in advance of any final decision related to the future of Sky TV,” the Guardian newspaper quoted Brown as saying in a letter to the government department responsible for media.  Murdoch’s bid for Sky was pulled in 2011 following public outrage at his now defunct tabloid the News of the World, some of whose staff hacked into phones to break news.  People familiar with the matter have told Reuters that Fox and Sky are working to hammer out the final details and could announce an agreement by the end of this week, possibly as soon as Thursday. Any bid will be examined by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to see whether it damages media plurality in Britain. The department declined to comment.

318,FOX,New accusations against former Fox News head Ailes in lawsuit,"(Reuters) - New sexual harassment accusations against former Fox News network chief Roger Ailes were revealed in a lawsuit filed against 21st Century Fox on Monday. The lawsuit comes just months after Fox News agreed to pay $20 million to settle separate allegations of sexual harassment of female staff at Fox News by Ailes. The federal discrimination lawsuit filed in New York alleges that Ailes offered Lidia Curanaj, whose legal name is Lidija Ujkic, an interview to join the Fox News Network after meeting her at a dinner in 2011. After being interviewed in a group setting, Ailes invited her to a private interview, the complaint said. He then told her it was “important [for female talent] to look good from head to toe,” and asked her to stand and turn around for him. The suit also alleged that Ailes later contacted a man Curanaj previously dated asking if she would “put out” sexually. The man told Ailes she likely would not, the suit said, after which she was turned down for the job. An attorney for Ailes could not be immediately reached to comment on the accusations, though he has consistently denied similar sexual harassment allegations. Curanaj’s lawsuit does not name Ailes or Fox News as a defendant, but rather alleges gender, age, race and pregnancy discrimination on the part of her employer, New York Fox TV station WNYW. The suit claims that when Curanaj confronted the station’s news director about not being promoted to anchor despite her journalistic experience and successes, he replied she was “not attractive enough to be an anchor.” A spokeswoman for Fox TV Stations, a subsidiary of 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), said in an emailed statement, “We do not think the plaintiff’s claims have merit, and we intend to defend vigorously.” Fox News in September agreed to pay $20 million to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by former anchor Gretchen Carlson. A subsequent internal investigation of the company turned up more than two dozen women who described harassment by Ailes, according to New York Magazine.

But the market had previously given Sky the thumbs-down, and the premium looks generous. A small sweetener is the best investors can hope for. The 85-year-old mogul’s 11 billion pound offer for the 61 percent of the group Fox doesn’t already own looks cannily timed. Before news of the bid was made public, Sky’s shares had lost about 30 percent since the start of the year. In U.S. dollar terms they were 40 percent cheaper. Comparative valuations are tricky because Sky is Britain’s only quoted pay-TV firm, and it competes with telecom operator BT for sports rights. Even so, Sky didn’t look obviously neglected. Judged on a multiple of forward earnings, it was trading at a similar premium to BT and UK broadcaster ITV as in early 2015 – though it had lost some altitude since Britain’s referendum on EU membership in June. It’s also hard to argue that investors lacked a clear picture. Sky had outlined its growth plans at a capital markets day in October. Despite the company’s flashy presentation, the shares continued to slide as investors fretted over the escalating costs of acquiring sports rights and the threat of online TV and movie services like Amazon and Netflix.  The premium also looks generous at 40 percent to the share price on Dec. 6, the last business day before Fox made its offer to Sky’s board. The average UK takeover commanded a 27 percent premium last year, and 35 percent this year so far, according to Thomson Reuters data. Takeovers like Sky where the buyer is also the largest shareholder tend to have smaller markups, due to the lack of competing bidders. Besides, Sky’s independent directors didn’t exactly roll over. They extracted a higher offer from Fox, which had initially proposed a lower price, according to a person familiar with the situation. And there are still issues to be negotiated which could affect the value, including how to share the risk of completion. Sky’s directors might be able to nudge Fox a bit more, but investors expecting a large bump will probably be disappointed.

321,FOX,UK PM and Murdoch did not discuss Sky bid at September meeting: minister,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May did not discuss with Rupert Murdoch the proposed takeover of UK pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L) by the tycoon’s Twenty-First Century Fox at a September meeting, Britain’s media minister said on Tuesday. May had met Murdoch during a meeting in New York, three months before Fox launched its approach for Sky earlier in December.  “She (May) had a pre-arranged meeting with Wall Street Journal editors,” Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Karen Bradley told parliament in reply to a question from a lawmaker. “Mr Murdoch dropped into that meeting and I can assure him (the questioner) that the proposed takeover was not discussed,” she added. Murdoch said on Monday he had never asked a British prime minister for anything, seeking to play down his influence ahead of what is likely to be a politically charged approval process for his $14.6 billion bid for Sky.  Bradley will have 10 days to decide whether the takeover triggers public interest concerns once she has received formal notification of the deal, which she said had yet to happen.  “What is important is that, given my quasi-judicial role, I protect the integrity of the process and ensure that as and when, if, a formal notification is given that that is properly considered,” she said. She also said she had had no prior knowledge that the deal was coming and first read about it in the press.

The Competition Bureau’s investigation found that an arrangement between the publishers and Apple led to higher prices for Canadians. The watchdog said it had entered into consent agreements with Apple, Lagardere SCA’s Hachette, Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH’s Macmillan and CBS Corp’s Simon & Schuster that will let other retailers, including Amazon.com and Kobo, give discounts on e-books by those publishers. The Competition Bureau, however, was unable to reach an agreement with a fourth publisher involved, News Corp’s HarperCollins, and filed an application to order it to halt its alleged anti-competitive practices.

First-half revenue rose 6 percent on a constant currency basis to 6.4 billion pounds ($8.09 billion). Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox agreed a $14.6 billion deal to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own in December.

324,FOX,"Twenty-First Century Fox profit tops estimates, revenue misses","(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) reported a quarterly profit that beat analysts’ expectations, as its television and cable units benefited from hosting the World Series and its  cable news channel enjoyed strong ratings during the U.S. presidential campaign. However, the Rupert Murdoch-controlled parent of Fox News and FX posted second-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations. Fox’s shares were down slightly 0.32 percent in after-hours trading on Monday. The second quarter results demonstrate the importance of live news and sports for media companies as Fox generated higher ad revenue from the World Series, higher political ad spending during the U.S. presidential election and higher affiliate revenue. On an analysts’ call Monday, Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch noted that the Super Bowl, which Fox hosted on Sunday night, marked the company’s first $500 million dollar revenue day.  He told analysts that he expects affiliate revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. Fox said revenue at its cable division, which houses the Fox channels among others, rose 7.1 percent to $3.97 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Domestic advertising sales in the cable business rose 12 percent in the quarter, the company said. Fox News finished 2016 as the most-watched U.S. cable network in prime time for the first time in its history, according to Nielsen data in December, as Trump’s victory drew in extraordinary audience interest. Twenty-First Century Fox said revenue in its film division decreased nearly 4 percent. The company’s total revenue increased 4.2 percent to $7.68 billion. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $7.72 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Fox shareholders rose to $856 million, or 46 cents per share, from $672 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Fox earned 53 cents per share, above analysts’ average estimate of 49 cents. Fox has also made a formal approach to take full control of the British-based Sky Plc (SKYB.L), with a $14.6 billion bid, enabling it to control a business with 22 million customers in Britain, Ireland, Italy, Germany and Austria. Chief Executive Officer James Murdoch said the company has no plans to bring that business to the United States. The company expects the deal to close on or before Dec. 31, 2017.

326,FOX,News Corp's adjusted profit edges past analysts estimates,"(Reuters) - News Corp (NWSA.O), the owner of Dow Jones Newswires and book publisher HarperCollins, posted an adjusted profit that edged past analysts’ estimates for the first time in three quarters as the drop in ad sales in its news business was offset by growth in its other businesses. Shares of the media conglomerate were up 1.6 percent at $12.59 after the bell on Thursday as investors looked past the Rupert Murdoch-controlled company posting its second straight quarterly net loss, which was mainly due to impairment charges. The company’s news and information business, which includes the Wall Street Journal and the Times in London, has been suffering from lower ad sales as readership dwindles, with readers opting for free news on websites and mobile apps. Revenue in the business fell nearly 7 percent to $1.30 billion in the second quarter, missing analysts’ average estimate of $1.34 billion, according to FactSet Street Account. Advertising revenue fell 8.3 percent to $748 million. News Corp has been cutting jobs and saving costs, while investing in its digital publishing business to boost margins. The company said subscribers to the digital version of the WSJ accounted for more than half of total subscribers for the first time ever. The news business’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) beat analysts’ estimates, as did EBITDA at its other businesses – book publishing, digital real estate services and cable network programming, according to FactSet Street Account. The real-estate business has been a particular bright spot for News Corp recently. It includes REA Group Ltd (REA.AX), a real estate ad company in Australia, and Realtor.com in the United States and other countries. Revenue in the business surged 16.3 percent in the quarter to $242 million, in line with analysts’ estimate. While the outsized contribution of the news business – about 60 percent of total revenue – meant News Corp’s revenue fell 2.1 percent to $2.12 billion, the decline was in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The net loss available to News Corp shareholders was $290 million, compared with a year-ago profit of $62 million. The latest quarter includes $537 million in impairment charges for write-downs related to the company’s Australian newspaper and television assets. That was partially offset by a $121 million tax benefit on the charge and a $120 million gain on the sale of REA’s European businesses.

The source, who declined to be named because the decision is not final, said Fox could notify the Commission on Friday or early next week in a move that will also trigger a short review by the British government. Murdoch’s bid to buy the rest of the British company it does not already own is likely to be a politically charged process. The Murdoch family have never wavered in their ambition to take full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt around 5-1/2 years ago when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal. In December they returned to the fray, striking a deal with Sky’s independent shareholders for Fox to pay 10.75 pounds per share for the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own to unite a media empire across two continents.

Analysts and lawyers expect the bid to be referred to Ofcom. The European Commission will examine the potential impact on competition.  Rupert’s son James, chief executive of Fox, has said he expects the deal to pass “regulatory muster” and, as long as regulators looked at the facts around media ownership, no “meaningful concessions” would be required.

But in keeping with their past practice, the Obamas plan to donate a “significant portion of their author proceeds to charity,” including the Obama Foundation, the publisher said in a statement.

336,FOX,Hulu to launch non-stop customer service as it readies live TV,"(Reuters) - Hulu will provide customer help 24 hours a day, seven days a week ahead of the upcoming launch of its live TV streaming service, and plans to open a service center by the fall, doubling investment in customer service over the next year so it can cope better with any glitches that arise, the company told Reuters this week. The TV streaming service provider, which is owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp, 21st Century Fox, and Time Warner Inc, will set up a new center in New Mexico or Texas by this fall and will hire 100 representatives this year, bringing its total to 300. The increased spending on customer service comes as Hulu is about to go head-to-head with internet channels that offer live TV from AT&T;’s DirecTVNow and Dish Network Corp’s Sling TV. The services have had hiccups - like shows freezing, viewers getting error messages and system crashes. Their owners also have large customer service staffs already handling calls from their traditional pay TV customers, said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associates. The stakes are high for Hulu, which has a customer defection rate of 50 percent, according to Parks Associates, a Dallas-based market research firm.  “Live TV is a challenge particularly for events like the Super Bowl and the Oscars which draw millions of subscribers all at the same time,” Sappington said. “You are never sure what’s going to break until you have a few million people watching at the same time.” Social media has amplified the need for good service because upset customers are more likely to go to Twitter with their complaints rather than call the company itself, said Bernard Gershon, president of media and technology consulting firm Gershon Media. Hulu will have staff available by phone 24 hours a day, seven days a week starting March 12, a change from the current hours of 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. Pacific Time, the company said. It will eventually add email and chat as well as social media. Hulu, which currently has most of its reps working remotely, will open a customer service center by the fall, and plans to have a staff of 500 by 2018. The company would not disclose how much it is investing in customer service. Currently, Hulu is running practice drills of potential glitches, said Ben Smith, a senior vice president at Hulu. In the next few weeks, Hulu will start running these drills on an unscheduled basis, he said. “Everyone’s plan is great until the emergency actually happens, he said.

338,FOX,UPDATE 2-UK government likely to refer Fox's Sky deal to regulator,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s planned takeover of European pay-TV group Sky is likely to be investigated to see whether it is in the public interest, the British government warned on Friday. Murdoch’s U.S. business Twenty-First Century Fox, which owns 39 percent of Sky, officially notified the European Commission of its 11.7 billion pounds ($14.3 billion) offer to buy the rest of Sky and kicked off what is likely to be a politically charged process. Media Secretary Karen Bradley said she was likely to intervene to see if any one company would control too much of Britain’s media, and whether the new owners would have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. The deal, announced in December, came five years after a political and criminal scandal at Murdoch’s British newspaper business derailed an earlier bid.  Shares in Sky were flat after the news. Fox said it had anticipated that regulators would undertake a thorough review of the transaction, and it looked forward to engaging with them. “We believe the combination of 21st Century Fox and Sky will create a company best suited to compete in a rapidly evolving industry, and are confident that the transaction will be approved based on a compelling fact set,” the U.S. company said. The Murdoch family has long wanted to control Sky, which has operations in Germany and Italy as well as Britain, to unite a media empire across two continents.  Some opposition lawmakers have already voiced their concern, saying Murdoch, the owner of The Times and The Sun newspapers, would wield too much power if he had full control of a pay-TV group present in more than 12 million British and Irish homes. Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson, a long-time critic of Rupert Murdoch, said the government should have referred the bid to the media regulator Ofcom immediately. “It is clear that Fox’s bid to take full control of Sky will significantly increase the size of the biggest media organization in the UK and further concentrate power in the hands of a dominant industry player,” he said. Murdoch’s son James, who is CEO of Fox and chairman of Sky, has said he expects the deal to pass regulatory muster.                    He said the media environment had radically changed in the last five years, giving consumers more choice than ever before in the TV market.  The notification to Brussels gives Britain’s Department of Media 10 working days to give its final verdict on whether the bid should be scrutinized by Ofcom. Bradley said she had invited representations from the companies involved, and would aim to come to a decision before 17 March.  The European Commission will separately examine whether the deal hurts competition. It said it would decide by April 7 whether to clear it, demand concessions or begin a five-month investigation. It approved the 2011 deal, although in the interim period Rupert Murdoch’s print and television businesses have been split into two companies, and Sky has acquired Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland.

The EU competition enforcer will decide by April 7 whether to clear the deal, demand concessions or kick off a five-month long investigation. Fox chief executive James Murdoch has said no “meaningful concessions” would be required.

342,FOX,Fox takes issue with UK government analysis of Sky deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox  said it was not surprised the British government wanted to scrutinise its takeover of Sky, but disputed the analysis that led to the view the deal may not be in the public interest. The company, which already owns 39 percent of Sky, agreed in December to buy the rest of the pay-TV group for 11.7 billion pounds ($14.2 billion), triggering a regulatory review of the politically sensitive deal. Media Secretary Karen Bradley said on Friday she was likely to intervene to see if any one company would control too much of Britain’s media, and whether the new owners would have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. The deal came five years after a political and criminal scandal at Murdoch’s British newspaper business derailed an earlier bid. In a letter to the Department of Media made public on Wednesday, Fox took issue with what it said were serious flaws in the process that led to the minister saying she was “minded” to refer the deal for a full investigation. While Fox said it would welcome a thorough regulatory review, it questioned the government’s analysis of Murdoch’s influence on the media market, saying the circulation of his newspapers had fallen and they were now held in a separate company. It also rejected any suggestion Fox had a weaker record than Sky when it came to broadcasting standards and said it had learnt from the mistakes made in the past, when Murdoch’s British newspaper arm admitted that some journalists at the News of the World had hacked into phones. “Twenty First Century Fox takes compliance matters extremely seriously and is proud of the transformation of its corporate governance and of the arrangements it has put in place since that time,” it said in the letter. Fox said it would welcome a decision whether to refer the bid to regulators as soon as possible, adding it was prepared to begin working with the regulatory bodies at the earliest opportunity ",3082017,http://www.reuters.com/article/sky-plc-ma-fox-letter/fox-takes-issue-with-uk-government-analysis-of-sky-deal-idUSL2N1GL214

345,FOX,UPDATE 2-British regulator to investigate Sky takeover by Murdoch's Fox,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government has referred Rupert Murdoch’s planned 11.7 billion pound ($14.4 billion) takeover of European pay-TV group Sky to regulators to decide if the deal is in the public interest. Media Secretary Karen Bradley told parliament it was important to seek advice from the regulator Ofcom on whether the deal would give Murdoch and his companies too much control of Britain’s media, and whether the new owner would be committed to broadcasting standards. Murdoch’s U.S. TV business Twenty-First Century Fox  already owns 39 percent of Sky. Murdoch and his family have long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal. Bradley has given Ofcom a 40-day timetable to investigate, and expects to receive its report by May 16. She said Ofcom, as an independent regulator, would assess in the same time frame whether Murdoch’s company was a “fit and proper” holder of a broadcasting license. Twenty-First Century Fox said it was looking forward to working with British authorities in their reviews of the deal, and it believed it would be approved. “We are confident that a thorough review of our track record over 30 years will underscore our commitment to upholding high broadcast standards, and will demonstrate that the transaction will not result in there being insufficient plurality in the UK,” the company said on Thursday. Some opposition lawmakers oppose the deal, saying Murdoch, the owner of The Times and The Sun newspapers, would wield too much influence if he had full control of a pay-TV group present in more than 12 million British and Irish homes. “Many of us believe if you look at the conduct of the Murdochs and the untrammeled power they already have it is not in the public interest for them to take over Sky and have full control,” Ed Miliband, former leader of the opposition Labour Party, said on Thursday. Miliband was a prominent critic of the deal the last time it was proposed. Murdoch’s son James, who is chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, was criticized by Ofcom in 2012 over his handling of the phone hacking scandal. The regulator said his management of the group’s UK newspapers at the time “repeatedly fell well short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman”, although it said Sky remained a fit and proper owner of broadcast licenses. Twenty-First Century Fox, which owns cable, film and pay-TV assets around the world, said the media market had changed dramatically in recent years as broadcasters face new challenges from streaming services. The Murdoch family’s newspaper businesses have been split from its television and film assets in a move that helped pave the way for another tilt at Sky. Sky has also combined its businesses in Britain, Germany and Italy since the previous bid. James Murdoch has sought industry backing for the deal by recently praising the quality and creativity of British television and the positive contribution made by Sky. He said a Fox-owned Sky would spend at least 700 million pounds a year on original British production.    Shares in Sky were largely unaffected by the decision, which had been widely expected after Bradley said earlier this month she was minded to intervene. They were trading up 0.4 percent at 9.89 pounds. The buyout offer is priced at 10.75 pounds.

349,FOX,Vice Media takes its edgy journalism to the Middle East,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Vice Media is bringing its edgy style of journalism to the Middle East to tap what it believes is an underserved market of young, digital hungry consumers. Vice announced its arrival with a party on Wednesday at the glitzy Armani Hotel in the world’s tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, the global trade hub where the New York-based company will set up its regional headquarters. Vice reckons the region’s youthful population coupled with some of the highest smartphone penetration rates in the world in countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates make it an ideal market to expand into. “That’s just a tremendous opportunity and we think that this is the time that we come in and steal a lot of market share,” Vice Co-Founder and Chief Executive Shane Smith told Reuters in an interview in Dubai on Wednesday.  Vice, which is aiming for 50 staff in Dubai by the end of the year, will launch a website and digital channel this summer and is in active discussions about a 24-hour regional cable channel to be broadcast from the emirate. It will produce news and lifestyle content in multiple languages including Arabic, English, Farsi, Turkish and Urdu. Vice has documented migrant worker abuses in Dubai, won acclaim for a documentary while embedded with Islamic State and garnered widespread attention when it took former National Basketball Association star Dennis Rodman to North Korea. “We’re always going to be looking at social justice, we’re always going to be looking at environmental justice, we’re always going to be looking at being on the right side of history, especially with millennials and our audience,” Smith said. Vice is likely to run into the same obstacles it has faced elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, “where journalists are most subjected to constraints of every kind”, according to global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders. Worth $4.2 billion at its last valuation, Vice has transformed in 23 years from a punk magazine in Montreal, Canada, into a global multimedia brand.  Its regional partner is Afghan media company Moby Group, whose Dubai offices are a few kilometers (miles) from the Trump International Golf Club which featured in a 2016 VICE episode on U.S. cable channel HBO about migrant worker exploitation. Vice and Moby share a common shareholder in 21st Century Fox and the Afghan company holds a license from the U.S. Treasury’s OFAC allowing it to expand into Iran - a market Vice wants to tap.

351,FOX,RPT-Vice Media takes its edgy journalism to the Middle East,"(Repeats story published March 29 to additional clients, no change to text) By Alexander Cornwell DUBAI, March 29 (Reuters) - Vice Media is bringing its edgy style of journalism to the Middle East to tap what it believes is an underserved market of young, digital hungry consumers. Vice announced its arrival with a party on Wednesday at the glitzy Armani Hotel in the world’s tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, the global trade hub where the New York-based company will set up its regional headquarters. Vice reckons the region’s youthful population coupled with some of the highest smartphone penetration rates in the world in countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates make it an ideal market to expand into. “That’s just a tremendous opportunity and we think that this is the time that we come in and steal a lot of market share,” Vice Co-Founder and Chief Executive Shane Smith told Reuters in an interview in Dubai on Wednesday. Vice, which is aiming for 50 staff in Dubai by the end of the year, will launch a website and digital channel this summer and is in active discussions about a 24-hour regional cable channel to be broadcast from the emirate. It will produce news and lifestyle content in multiple languages including Arabic, English, Farsi, Turkish and Urdu. Vice has documented migrant worker abuses in Dubai, won acclaim for a documentary while embedded with Islamic State and garnered widespread attention when it took former National Basketball Association star Dennis Rodman to North Korea. “We’re always going to be looking at social justice, we’re always going to be looking at environmental justice, we’re always going to be looking at being on the right side of history, especially with millennials and our audience,” Smith said. Vice is likely to run into the same obstacles it has faced elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, “where journalists are most subjected to constraints of every kind”, according to global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders. Worth $4.2 billion at its last valuation, Vice has transformed in 23 years from a punk magazine in Montreal, Canada, into a global multimedia brand. Its regional partner is Afghan media company Moby Group, whose Dubai offices are a few kilometres (miles) from the Trump International Golf Club which featured in a 2016 VICE episode on U.S. cable channel HBO about migrant worker exploitation. Vice and Moby share a common shareholder in 21st Century Fox and the Afghan company holds a license from the U.S. Treasury’s OFAC allowing it to expand into Iran - a market Vice wants to tap.

Please accept our apologies,” the newspaper said on Twitter several hours after the alerts went out. The tabloid newspaper did not provide details of the alerts from its app, but screen grabs posted online by Twitter users included an alert reading “Heil President Donald Trump!” among a series that ran on Saturday, which was April Fool’s Day. Other posts were more cryptic, vague or seemingly religious in nature, with the final one reading “with Lucid Love, Selah,” according to media reports and screen shots posted on Twitter.

354,FOX,Murdoch's Fox wins EU approval to take over Sky,"BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Commission cleared Rupert Murdoch to take over pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L) on Friday, leaving a British investigation into the impact on the country’s media landscape as the only remaining hurdle for the $14.5 billion deal. The Commission said the bid did not raise any competition concerns as Murdoch’s Twenty First Century Fox (FOXA.O) and Sky were active in different markets in Europe, while existing rules in European Union countries meant that rivals would still have access to Sky films and TV channels. Fox and Sky welcomed the decision, which had been expected, and said they would continue to work with the regulators in Britain where it faces a tougher test to complete the deal.  “We now look forward to continuing to work with UK authorities and are confident that the proposed transaction will be approved following a thorough review process,” Fox said. Reuters reported earlier on Friday that the deal would be cleared by the EU competition enforcer without conditions. Analysts had not expected the EU to block the takeover after it approved Murdoch’s previous attempt to take full control of Sky in 2011, a deal that was later derailed by a phone hacking scandal at his British newspapers that revealed close ties between politicians, police and media.  The British government however has referred his new attempt to regulators to decide if it is in the public interest, in a bid to diffuse the political controversy around a deal that would extend Murdoch’s influence in Britain.   Regulator Ofcom will advise on whether the deal would give Murdoch and his companies too much control of Britain’s media, and whether the new owner would be committed to upholding broadcasting standards. As part of the investigation, Media Secretary Karen Bradley has also asked Ofcom to assess whether Murdoch’s company is a “fit and proper” holder of a broadcasting license. Murdoch’s son James, who is chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, was criticized by Ofcom in 2012 over his handling of the phone hacking scandal but it ultimately ruled that Sky remained a fit and proper owner of a license.  Rupert Murdoch, through another part of his media empire, owns The Times and The Sun newspapers, and already has a 39 percent stake in Sky, which is present in more than 12 million British and Irish homes.  It is also present in Germany, Austria and Italy. Bradley has given Ofcom a 40-day timetable to investigate, and expects to receive its report by May 16.

357,FOX,Fox to investigate sexual harassment claim against O'Reilly,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fox News parent Twenty-First Century Fox Inc said on Sunday it will investigate a sexual harassment claim against TV anchor Bill O’Reilly, who has seen several companies pull their ads from his top-rated news show in the past week.    The investigation comes after a complaint was phoned in to the network’s corporate hotline last week by Wendy Walsh, a former regular guest on Fox’s “The O’Reilly Factor” TV show, and her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, which the two posted to YouTube. “21st Century Fox investigates all complaints and we have asked the law firm Paul Weiss to continue assisting the company in these serious matters,” the company said in a statement.   Walsh, a psychologist and radio host, said O’Reilly reneged on an offer to secure her a lucrative job on the network after she declined his invitation to join him in his hotel suite after a dinner in early 2013.  “I’m told that they are taking it seriously, and they are going to do the investigation that’s legally required of them,” Bloom told CNN on Sunday. Fox and O’Reilly have paid $13 million to five women who accused him of sexual harassment, the New York Times reported last weekend. O’Reilly said in a statement then that he had been unfairly targeted because of his prominence and has not made further comment. Numerous companies have pulled ads from O’Reilly’s Fox News show since the report, including BMW of North America, Allstate Corp, French pharmaceuticals maker Sanofi SA, direct marketer Constant Contact, men’s clothing company Untuckit and mutual fund operator T. Rowe Price. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc said it temporarily suspended its advertising.    Fox News, the top-rated cable news network, has faced heightened scrutiny of its workplace climate after sexual harassment allegations led to the resignation of founding Chairman Roger Ailes last year.   21st Century Fox hired law firm Paul Weiss to investigate Ailes.  On April 3, Democratic political consultant and Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky sued the network and Ailes, accusing them of denying her a permanent hosting job after she rebuffed Ailes’ sexual advances. Roginsky said that a misogynistic culture at Fox News had not changed since Ailes left the network.

Apple shares jumped as much as 1.8 percent to a record high of $146.29, boosting all the three major Wall Street indexes. Apple is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P; 500 technology index was up 0.6 percent – one of only four among the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors to post gains. The other sectors were kept in check by weak construction spending and manufacturing data that came on the heels of weak first-quarter GDP data on Friday and ahead of the monthly jobs data at the end of this week. Construction spending unexpectedly fell in March from a record high amid a pause in private construction investment after five straight months of increases. Other data showed the ISM manufacturing activity index fell to its lowest level since December while consumer spending was unchanged in March for a second straight month and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. The industrials and materials indexes were little changed. “The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday,” said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. “While we’re starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong.” At 10:51 a.m. ET (1451 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.37 points, or 0.1 percent, at 20,960.88. The S&P; 500 was up 5.27 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,389.47 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 29.56 points, or 0.49 percent, at 6,077.17. Trading volume is expected to be light, with many markets in Asia and Europe closed for Labor Day, but will pick up through the week as major earnings reports and economic data pour in. Overall, profit at S&P; 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Tribune Media jumped 6.1 percent to $38.79 after Reuters reported Twenty-First Century Fox is in talks with Blackstone to buy the television station operator. Fox shares were down 0.49 percent at $30.39. Diamond Offshore Drilling fell 4.9 percent to $13.71 after reporting a lower quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,577 to 1,117. On the Nasdaq, 1,494 issues rose and 1,137 fell.

The House of Representatives and Senate must approve the deal before the end of Friday, as must President Donald Trump, to keep the government funded through the end of Sept. 30. “We have some renewed optimism that the market strength will continue helped by strong earnings and as a government shutdown was averted,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC  in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “We’re also coming off a weak trading session on Friday, and investors are keeping an eye on the jobs report later this week.” At 9:35 a.m. ET (1335 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.15 points, or 0.06 percent, at 20,953.66. The S&P; 500 was up 4.3 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,388.5 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 21.15 points, or 0.35 percent, at 6,068.76. Nine of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, led by identical gains of 0.35 percent in the financial and technology indexes. Apple’s 1.1 percent rise boosted all three indexes. Trading volume is expected to be light, with many markets in Asia and Europe closed for Labor Day, but will pick up through the week as major earnings reports and economic data pour in. A data-heavy week will culminate with the monthly jobs report on Friday. The Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday could shed policymakers’ insights into weak first-quarter economic growth. U.S. consumer spending was unchanged in March for a second straight month and the overall monthly inflation rate fell for the first time in a year. But, inflation-adjusted consumer spending increased after two straight months of decline. Stocks edged lower on Friday due to the weak GDP data, but Wall Street’s major indexes ended with gains for April, helped by strong quarterly earnings. Overall, profit at S&P; 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Caterpillar were up 0.66 percent at $102.92. Barron’s said the stock could rise another 20 percent over the next year, helped by Trump’s policies. Dish Network fell 2.22 percent to $63.01 after the satellite TV provider’s quarterly revenue missed expectations. Tribune Media jumped 8.9 percent to $39.82 after Reuters reported Twenty-First Century Fox is in talks with Blackstone to buy the television station operator. Fox shares were down 0.13 percent at $30.50. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,663 to 857. On the Nasdaq, 1,447 issues rose and 747 fell.

The House of Representatives and Senate must approve the deal before the end of Friday, as must President Donald Trump, to keep the government funded through the end of Sept. 30. “We have some renewed optimism that the market strength will continue helped by strong earnings and as a government shutdown was averted,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC  in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “We’re also coming off a weak trading session on Friday, and investors are keeping an eye on the jobs report later this week.” Dow e-minis were up 40 points, or 0.19 percent, with 9,865 contracts changing hands at 8:34 a.m. ET 91234 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were up 5.75 points, or 0.24 percent, with 53,968 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 17.25 points, or 0.31 percent, on volume of 11,833 contracts. Trading volume is expected to be light, with many markets in Asia and Europe closed for Labor Day. A host of economic data is expected this week, culminating with the monthly jobs report on Friday. The Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday could shed policymakers’ insights into weak first-quarter economic growth. Data released on Monday showed U.S. consumer spending was unchanged in March for a second straight month and the overall monthly inflation rate fell for the first time in a year. But, when adjusted for inflation, consumer spending, increased 0.3 percent, ending two straight months of decline. Other data due includes the Institute for Supply Management releases its manufacturing index for April at 10 a.m. ET, which is expected to show a slightly lower reading of 56.4. Markit Manufacturing PMI final figures for April and construction spending numbers for March are also expected. Stocks edged lower on Wall Street on Friday after data showing the U.S. economy grew at its weakest pace in three years in the first quarter gave traders a reason to cash recent gains. However, Wall Street’s major indexes ended with gains for April, helped by strong quarterly earnings. Overall, profit at S&P; 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Caterpillar were up 0.77 percent at $103.05 in premarket reading. Barron’s said the stock could rise another 20 percent over the next year, helped by Trump’s policies. Dish Network fell 1.46 percent to $63.50 after the satellite TV provider’s quarterly revenue missed expectations. Tribune Media jumped 9.14 percent to $39.90 after Reuters reported Twenty-First Century Fox is in talks with Blackstone to buy the television station operator. Fox shares were down 0.30 percent at $30.45.

366,FOX,News Corp quarterly revenue beats on higher ad revenue,"(Reuters) - News Corp (NWSA.O) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue as the owner of the Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal saw an uptick in its digital real estate business and growth in its advertising revenue. Shares of the company, controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, were up 2.2 percent in extended trading on Tuesday. While News Corp’s earnings are still under pressure amid print advertising declines, they have been stabilizing with continued cost-cutting efforts and investments in the company’s digital businesses to boost margins. Revenue in the company’s news and information division, which accounts for over 60 percent of total revenue, rose to $1.26 billion as the transition to digital platforms pays off.        The company said digital subscribers accounted for 53 percent of total subscriptions for the Wall Street Journal, up from 44 percent a year earlier. The subscription numbers suggest that there is an appetite for “premium news” and “thoughtful commentary”, Chief Executive Robert Thomson said on a call with analysts. The Trump administration’s combative view of traditional news media as “fake news” is helping out newspapers, which are struggling, to attract more digital readers and advertisers. News Corp’s advertising revenue rose 5.1 percent to $705 million. However, gains were partially offset by weakness in the print advertising market. The company said revenue in its high-growth digital real-estate business jumped nearly 13 percent to $219 million. The business includes REA Group Ltd (REA.AX), an Australian company which advertises property and property-related services on websites and mobile apps, and Move Inc, which operates Realtor.com in the United States and other countries. News Corp, which owns book publisher HarperCollins, said revenue from its book publishing business rose 4.5 percent to $374 million helped by strong sales of Margot Lee Shetterly’s “Hidden Figures”. Net loss available to shareholders narrowed to $5 million, or 1 cent per share, in the third quarter ended March 31, from $149 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company took a charge of $280 million. Excluding items, the company earned 7 cents per share, beating the average analysts’ estimates of 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

369,FOX,Fox News complainant meets UK regulator over Sky-Fox deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - A woman who accused former Fox News presenter Bill O’Reilly of sexual harassment in the United States called on Britain on Monday to block Fox’s owner Rupert Murdoch from taking full control of Britain’s pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L). Wendy Walsh, a former regular guest on Fox’s “The O’Reilly Factor” TV show who made the claim against O’Reilly last month, met officials at the British media regulator Ofcom on Monday with her lawyer Lisa Bloom, a representative said. Ofcom declined to comment on the visit. The British government has asked Ofcom to assess whether it is in the public interest to allow Murdoch’s Twenty First Century Fox (FOXA.O) to buy the near 61 percent of London-listed Sky which it does not already own for $14.5 billion. The deal was cleared by the European Commission last month. But the takeover is politically sensitive in Britain where a previous attempt to take full control of Sky in 2011 was derailed by a phone hacking scandal at one of Murdoch’s British newspapers, revealing close ties between politicians, police and the media.  As part of the new investigation, Ofcom is examining whether Fox would be a “fit and proper” owner of Sky, making any criticism of its conduct in other parts of its business relevant to the case in Britain.  O’Reilly parted company with Fox last month after the company said it had given “a thorough and careful review” of allegations of sexual harassment. Earlier in the month The New York Times had said Fox and O’Reilly paid five women a total of $13 million to settle harassment claims.   O’Reilly said in a statement at the time that he had been unfairly targeted because of his public prominence. “The company’s management has taken prompt and decisive action to address reports of sexual harassment and workplace issues at Fox News,” a spokesman for 21st Century Fox said on Monday.  “These actions have led to an overhaul of Fox News Channel’s leadership, management and reporting structure, and have driven fundamental changes to the channel’s on-air talent and primetime programming line-up.” Douglas Wigdor, a New York City lawyer who represents 20 current and former Fox News employees who are suing the network  for alleged racial and sexual bias, said last week that he had been invited to meet with Ofcom officials on Thursday.  In a letter to Ofcom Wigdor said last week Fox had shown poor corporate governance by ignoring numerous complaints of discrimination and harassment.

372,FOX,Twenty-First Century Fox misses Wall Street sales target,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), the television and film company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, reported quarterly revenue below Wall Street’s expectations on Wednesday, weighed down by weaker box office results. Its shares initially dipped in after-hours trading, but then regained ground to where they ended regular trading, at $27.90. Sales at the company’s film division fell nearly 3 percent to $2.26 billion in the fiscal third quarter as releases like “Logan”, grossed less than the 2016 hit “Deadpool” did in the same quarter last year.  The television side of Fox’s business fared better, posting an increase in both advertising and U.S. cable, even as many of its peers have reported declines in both areas.  Fox’s ad sales jumped 16 percent, helped by spending on the Super Bowl, which Fox aired this year. Chief Executive James Murdoch, Rupert’s son, told analysts on a post-earnings call that all of its networks except National Geographic showed advertising growth. Still, some analysts hoped for more.  “The cable business is more of a recurring business than film,” said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Thomas Eagan. “People were expecting higher domestic affiliate growth and higher ad growth.”  U.S. subscribers were up 0.5 percent, but there were declines for its most widely distributed networks, which include Fox News, of about 1.5 percent year over year, James Murdoch said on the analyst call.  Sexual harassment claims and lawsuits at Fox News, which have led to the departures of its former chair Roger Ailes, network co-president Bill Shine and star anchor Bill O’Reilly, have some investors concerned about the future of the unit. To settle litigation following the July 2016 resignation of Ailes, the company incurred costs to the tune of $10 million in the quarter, bringing such costs to a total of $45 million in the nine months to March 31, a regulatory filing showed.     James Murdoch expressed confidence to investors on the earnings call that Fox News would continue its ratings dominance.

376,FOX,UPDATE 2-Second US buyout firm bids for Australia's Fairfax Media,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s oldest newspaper publisher Fairfax Media Ltd (FXJ.AX) on Thursday said it has received a takeover bid worth as much as A$2.87 billion ($2.13 billion) from a second U.S. private equity firm, sending its shares sharply higher. The surprise offer from buyout firm Hellman & Friedman values Fairfax at A$1.225 to A$1.25 a share, compared to an earlier offer from TPG Capital Management and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board of A$1.20 a share. Investors welcomed the prospect of a bidding war for the 186-year-old publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Financial Review newspapers, although lawmakers have expressed concern over the possible impact on local journalism. “It is always good that there is a bit more competitive tension,” said Suhas Nayak, a portfolio manager at Allan Gray, which holds Fairfax shares. “It is a waiting game from here.” Fairfax shares leapt 6.7 percent to A$1.24 by mid-session on Thursday, in line with Hellman’s indicative offer range. The broader sharemarket was down 1.2 percent. The Sydney-based publisher said it would allow both suitors to conduct due diligence “to explore whether a potential whole of company proposal is available”. The chairman emeritus of Hellman, Brian Powers, was the chairman of Fairfax from 1999 to 2002. Hellman declined to comment. TPG said it welcomed the opportunity to conduct due diligence and declined to comment on the Hellman bid. Fairfax investors have watched the stock sink from A$4.99 in 2007 when its long-term problems began with the migration of classified advertising to the internet. The shares hit a low of 36 Australian cents in 2012 and have barely recovered despite rounds of slashing cost cuts. Its real estate classifieds unit, Domain, is now its biggest profit generator, and shareholders have been eager for the company to spin off the unit as Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp (NWSA.O) did with its property website in 1999. Shares in that company, REA Group Ltd (REA.AX), have climbed from A$6.00 to A$61.88 over the past decade. Analysts expect any private equity buyer to keep Domain and metropolitan mastheads and dump non-core regional news, radio and streaming video businesses, raising fears for the future of public interest journalism in a market already dominated by a handful of media proprietors. Any foreign takeover of Fairfax would need regulatory approval, and some lawmakers have already threatened to oppose the TPG deal on public interest grounds. Opposition Labor Senator Sam Dastyari on Wednesday told a parliamentary inquiry into the future of journalism in Australia he supported placing “controls and restrictions” on TPG if its bid was approved.

New York City lawyer Douglas Wigdor filed lawsuits in federal court in Manhattan on behalf of Kathleen Lee, a Fox News Radio shift editor who says she was sexually harassed and subjected to “unceasing retaliation” for complaining, and Naima Farrow, who maintains she was fired from her job as an accounts payable coordinator after telling supervisors she was pregnant.

380,FOX,UK to give new ruling on Fox-Sky takeover by June 29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch will find out by June 29 whether he is closer to securing takeover target Sky (SKYB.L) after Britain set out a timetable to rule on whether the media mogul is a suitable owner of Europe’s biggest broadcaster. Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) has offered $14.8 billion to buy the 61 percent of Britain’s Sky it does not already own, reigniting a row in the country over whether the Australian-born businessman has too much influence. On Tuesday two regulators submitted their findings to the government after being asked to look into whether Fox would have too much control of the media, and whether it would be committed to upholding broadcasting standards if the deal went ahead.  Media regulator Ofcom has also examined whether executives at Fox are “fit and proper” to hold a broadcasting license.  The reports will be made public when the British government makes its statement. The government will now decide whether to approve the deal, whether to refer it to the Competition and Markets Authority for a longer investigation or whether to engage with both parties to find solutions to their concerns. Media Secretary Karen Bradley said she would make an initial statement by June 29. “There will then be an opportunity for representations to be made before I take a final decision,” she said. Murdoch and his family have long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal which forced them to drop the bid.  Wary of the political fallout from the last attempt, when a public inquiry exposed close ties between Murdoch’s newspapers and leading politicians, the British government has asked its regulators to assess the impact.  Fox, which owns cable, film and pay-TV assets around the world, says the media market has changed dramatically in recent years as broadcasters face new challenges from streaming services like Netflix. The Murdoch family has split its newspaper businesses, which own the Times and Sun papers in Britain, from its television and film assets in a move that helped pave the way for another tilt at Sky.

382,FOX,Britain says Fox bid for Sky risks giving Murdoch too much power,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain intends to subject Rupert Murdoch’s takeover of European pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L) to a lengthy in-depth investigation after finding the $15 billion deal risks giving the media mogul too much power over the news agenda. Media Secretary Karen Bradley said she was persuaded that Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) bid could give the Murdoch family excessive influence over the media, after regulator Ofcom assessed the impact of the deal.  “The proposed entity would have the third largest total reach of any news provider - lower only than the BBC and ITN - and would, uniquely, span news coverage on television, radio, in newspapers and online,” Bradley said. The Media Secretary said she would take a final decision on July 14, giving Fox two weeks to address her concerns. Shares in Sky rose on hopes a full investigation could still be averted by concessions over its 24-hour TV news channel.  Murdoch, 86, and his family have long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal which forced them to abandon that bid. A public inquiry into the affair revealed deep ties between Murdoch and the political establishment, making the renewed bid potentially toxic for Prime Minister Theresa May’s government which is fighting for survival after losing its majority. Bradley had asked regulators to examine whether Fox would have too much control of the media, and whether it would be committed to upholding broadcasting standards if allowed to buy the company which broadcasts in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.  Fox said it was disappointed by the government’s rejection of its plans to maintain editorial independence of Sky News, and said a full investigation could push the deal’s completion date back to next June. “We will continue to work constructively with the UK authorities,” it said.  During the previous takeover attempt Murdoch proposed spinning off Sky News into a separate company. However, Ofcom said on Thursday it was concerned that separating Sky News could be counter-productive, given the potential difficulties in funding the service outside of the Sky structure. The British government said on Thursday Ofcom had no concerns about Fox’s genuine commitment to broadcasting standards but wanted to look further into the impact a deal would have on the range of media providers in the country.  Britain’s political leaders have long sought the backing of Murdoch and his Times and Sun newspapers, sparking accusations that he uses his media empire to play puppet master in the corridors of power.  Tom Watson, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party and a long-standing Murdoch critic, said the government was going through the motions and would ultimately approve the deal.  “The parties will offer up something new, which they always had in their back pockets, the secretary of state will accept them, as she always planned, and this merger will go ahead,” he said. History shows, he said, that any concession by the Murdochs would not be “worth the newsprint” it was published on.  Ofcom also carried out a separate investigation as to whether a Fox-controlled Sky would be a ‘fit and proper’ owner of broadcast licences in Britain.  The regulator said allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News in the U.S. were extremely serious and disturbing but had found no clear evidence to suggest senior executives at Fox were aware of the misconduct. Fox tried to pre-empt government concerns over the impact on Sky’s editorial independence by proposing the creation of an independent board to run Sky News, the company’s influential 24-hour news channel. But Bradley said she was minded to reject the proposal after Ofcom suggested that the undertakings were not strong enough. “Sky will continue to engage with the process as the Secretary of State reaches her final decision,” the company said in a statement. Launched in 1989, Sky used exclusive Premier League soccer to draw in customers to pay-TV and pioneered round-the-clock  news to make it a major player politically and commercially. It now broadcasts to 22 million homes, competing with the publicly-owned BBC and ITN, commercial TV’s news provider.  The latest delay to the deal will come as a blow to the Murdoch family after they split their newspapers from television and film assets into two separate companies, even though they retained a grip on both due to their ultimate ownership. Rupert’s son James, who is chief executive of Fox and is currently chairman of Sky, said in March that worries about his family exerting too much power were unfounded in an era of online providers such as Facebook, Buzzfeed, Netflix and Google.  Shares in Sky have been trading at a discount to the 10.75 pounds offer, indicating that although investors were not expecting outright rejection, there was still some concern about any undertakings required from Fox to get the deal through. The stock was trading up 3 percent at 987 pence on Thursday afternoon in the belief that Fox would find a resolution. Analysts at Citi said Fox could even find a resolution before the July 14 deadline and avoid the lengthy referral.  “Ultimately this is a positive outcome for the Fox/Sky in the sense that it makes deal completion more likely,” they said. “Concerns about broadcasting standards would have been almost impossible to work around while we believe the groups will be able to offer concessions that adequately address concerns about plurality.”  ",6292017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-fox/britain-says-fox-bid-for-sky-risks-giving-murdoch-too-much-power-idUSKBN19K1D9

384,FOX,Text: Britain says Fox bid for Sky gives Murdoch too much power over news,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain intends to refer Rupert Murdoch’s takeover of Sky (SKYB.L) to a full investigation because the deal raises concerns about the amount of influence the media mogul would wield. Below is Culture Secretary Karen Bradley’s statement to parliament, lightly abridged. “I came to this House, on 16 March, to confirm that I had issued a European Intervention Notice (EIN) in relation to the proposed merger between 21st Century Fox and Sky Plc on the grounds of media plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards. The EIN triggered a requirement for Ofcom to report - initially by 16 May but extended to 20 June - on the media public interest considerations and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on jurisdiction.  In line with my commitments, I am today publishing both documents.      On the question of whether the merger gives rise to public interest concerns in relation to media plurality, Ofcom’s report is unambiguous. It concludes, “The transaction raises public interest concerns as a result of the risk of increased influence by members of the Murdoch Family Trust over the UK news agenda and the political process, with its unique presence on radio, television, in print and online. We consider that the plurality concerns may justify the Secretary of State making a reference to the Competition and Markets Authority”. On the basis of Ofcom’s assessment, I confirm that I am minded to refer to a Phase 2 investigation on the grounds of media plurality. The reasoning and evidence on which Ofcom’s recommendation is based are persuasive. The proposed entity would have the third largest total reach of any news provider - lower only than the BBC and ITN - and would, uniquely, span news coverage on television, radio, in newspapers and online. Ofcom’s report states that the proposed transaction would give the Murdoch Family Trust material influence over news providers with a significant presence across all key platforms. This potentially raises public interest concerns because, in Ofcom’s view, the transaction may increase members of the Murdoch Family Trust’s ability to influence the overall news agenda and their ability to influence the political process and it may also result in the perception of increased influence. These are clear grounds whereby a referral to a Phase 2 investigation is warranted - so that is what I am minded to do. There is, however, a statutory process that I must follow. I am required by legislation to allow the parties the opportunity to make representations to me on this position before I reach a final decision. I will now do that and have given them until Friday 14 July to respond. The second question concerns whether after the merger the relevant media enterprises would have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. Ofcom is unequivocal. It concludes, “In light of Fox’s and Sky’s broadcast compliance records and taking account of our separate assessment of whether Sky remains fit and proper to hold broadcast licenses following the transaction, we do not consider that the merged entity would lack a genuine commitment to the attainment of broadcasting standards. Therefore, we consider that there are no broadcasting standards concerns that may justify a reference by the Secretary of State to the Competition and Markets Authority”. Ofcom’s approach sought to measure commitment to broadcasting standards by reference to breaches of regulatory codes. It found that Fox’s compliance with the UK’s Broadcasting Code is in line with comparable broadcasters. Nor did Fox’s compliance record in relation to overseas broadcast jurisdictions (where Ofcom’s analysis focused largely on the EU) give cause for concern. I also asked Ofcom to consider the effect of any failure of corporate governance on this public interest consideration. Ofcom did this in the context of its separate assessment of whether Fox and Sky would remain fit and proper to hold broadcast licenses following the transaction. It concluded that behaviors alleged at Fox News in the U.S. amount to ‘significant corporate failures’. However, these did not in its view demonstrate that the merged company would lack a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. In reaching a view I have to be guided only by the evidence before me. As such - based on the Ofcom report - I am currently minded not to refer to a Phase 2 investigation in relation to a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. As required by legislation, I am giving the parties an opportunity to make representations in relation to media plurality grounds - where I am minded to refer for a phase two investigation by the CMA. In the interests of transparency and ensuring all the evidence has been considered, I will also invite wider representations on the question of commitment to broadcasting standards - where I am currently minded not to refer for a phase two investigation. While there are strong feelings among both supporters and opponents of this merger, in this quasi judicial process, my decisions can only be influenced by facts, not opinions - and by the quality of evidence, not who shouts the loudest. The invitation to make representations will open today and close on Friday 14 July and can be found on the DCMS website. To be clear, the minded-to decisions I have outlined today are not my final decisions. A word before I close on Ofcom’s fit and proper assessment. As the independent regulator, this is a matter for Ofcom, and my understanding is they will publish their report today. I have seen the report and know many members in this house will want to comment on it. Given my current quasi-judicial role in the merger I will not be commenting on the findings. It is rightly not for Government to determine who should, and should not, hold TV broadcasting licenses. Ofcom has an on-going duty to ensure all UK broadcasters are fit and proper to hold TV broadcasting licenses. I am clear that if any evidence comes to light then it is for Ofcom to take account of that evidence. I trust - as before - that this update is helpful to Honourable and Right Honourable Members and that this statement gives an opportunity to debate this important issue, while at the same time, respecting the limits of what I can say given my ongoing quasi-judicial role in relation to this merger. I commend this statement to the House. ",6292017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-fox-text/text-britain-says-fox-bid-for-sky-gives-murdoch-too-much-power-over-news-idUSKBN19K1LN

386,FOX,Fox Sports dismisses president of national networks,"(Reuters) - Fox Sports fired Jamie Horowitz, its president of national networks, on Monday, according to a memo sent to employees, which provided no reasons for the dismissal but did emphasize the importance of “professional conduct.” Horowitz’s departure comes amid allegations of sexual harassment, according to reports by The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. Reuters could not independently verify those allegations.   Horowitz’s attorney, Patricia Glaser, a partner with Glaser Weil, called Fox’s treatment of Horowitz “appalling.” “At no point in his tenure was there any mention by his superiors or human resources of any misconduct or an inability to adhere to professional conduct,” Glaser said in a statement. “Any slanderous accusations to the contrary will be vigorously defended.”  A spokeswoman for Fox Sports, part of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), declined to comment further on Horowitz’s departure, which was effective immediately. Daniel Petrocelli, an attorney with O’Melveny & Myers, which is representing Fox Sports, said in a statement that Horowitz’s departure was “fully warranted,” and he called the accusations by Horowitz’s attorney “ill-informed and misguided.”  In the memo to employees, which was seen by Reuters, Eric Shanks, president of Fox Sports, wrote that everyone at Fox Sports “should act with respect and adhere to professional conduct at all times. These values are non-negotiable.” Horowitz’s dismissal comes at a sensitive time for 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch  and is awaiting regulatory approval of its $15.2 billion acquisition of the UK’s Sky Plc.  Sexual harassment claims and lawsuits at another 21st Century Fox unit, Fox News, which led to the departures of former Chair Roger Ailes and star anchor Bill O’Reilly, have caused some investor concern about the future of the unit.  However, unlike at Fox News, there has been no litigation or settlements involving behavior at Fox Sports, according to a person familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous because the matter is private.  In the memo, Shanks said he would take over Horowitz’s responsibilities until a replacement is named. Horowitz had been in his position at Fox Sports since May 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile. A Fox web page on Horowitz had been taken down on Monday.

387,FOX,Australia's Fairfax ends talks with PE suitors without formal bid,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian newspaper publisher Fairfax Media Ltd said two private equity firms withdrew from rival takeover bids worth up to A$2.9 billion ($2.2 billion), leaving it to proceed with demerger plans and sending its shares sharply lower. The country’s oldest newspaper house, owner of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian Financial Review, was midway through spinning off its property listings unit when TPG Capital Management LP and Hellman & Friedman made buyout approaches in May. With neither firm lodging a binding offer by a June 30 deadline, Sydney-headquartered Fairfax said it would now press ahead with a break-up which would see it list its biggest revenue generator, Domain. “It appeared that the complication of our business was such that they didn’t want to bid for the whole business,” Fairfax Chairman Nick Falloon told an analyst briefing on Monday morning. Fairfax shares fell as much as 13 percent, hitting their lowest intraday level since March, 92 cents, compared with the higher of the private equity indicative bids, A$1.25. The stock traded at A$5.00 in 2007. Traditional media companies around the world have been in decline as customers seek content more cheaply online and advertisers focus their spending on internet giants like Facebook Inc and Google. Domain however has benefited from a property boom in Sydney and Melbourne. A standalone Domain listing will see it compete more directly with REA Group Ltd, a property classifieds business two-thirds owned by News Corp. REA shares have doubled in two years and Fairfax shareholders have long hoped for similar returns from a Domain listing, with Fairfax keeping up to 70 percent of the unit.  “Domain’s continuing to grow and ... get closer to REA,” said Reece Birtles, managing director at fund manager Martin Currie Australia, Fairfax’s second-biggest shareholder. “The digitization of the traditional newspaper business is removing significant costs, so we think they have a good future.” Fairfax said that while overall revenue fell about 6 percent for the year to June 30, Domain’s revenue grew about 10 percent, including an increase of 22 percent in digital revenue. It said it expected to report pre-tax profit between $262 million and A$266 million for the year, in line with analyst expectations and down as much 7.5 percent on the previous year.

390,FOX,Internet TV company Roku hires banks for 2017 IPO -sources,"(Reuters) - Internet television company Roku has hired investment banks to lead an initial public offering that could come later this year as it aims for a valuation of more than $1 billion, sources familiar with the matter said. An IPO will test investor’s reception to Roku, the brainchild of digital video recorder (DVR) inventor Anthony Wood that was a pioneer in helping consumers cut the cord from traditional cable.          Roku made one of the first devices to offer streaming Internet content such as Netflix over TVs, but the market has since become more competitive, with Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google, Amazon.com Inc and others offering their own devices. Los Gatos, California-based Roku, which had prepared a confidential filing in 2014, is drafting a new registration document to account for the shift in its business model toward higher-margin advertising and licensing revenue, one of the sources said.  It has also hired a new adviser, Morgan Stanley, to lead the IPO, along with Citigroup Inc, the sources said, asking not to be named because the process is confidential. Morgan Stanley, Roku and Citi declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Roku had hired underwriters on Thursday.  The company said in February that it generated $400 million in revenue last year, with $100 million in its media and licensing segment. Roku’s platform has been open to carrying more TV apps than its peers, including Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Google Play. Apple TV only recently announced plans to support Amazon Prime Video. The company has been fighting a legal ban in the Mexico, where cable operators are trying to stop the import and distribution of Roku devices on the grounds that they are sometimes hacked in order to watch pirated channels. Roku has been offering paid advertising options for its partners and gets a cut of advertising revenue from media companies with apps on its platform. It also licenses its software to companies like Sharp and Hitachi, allowing them to make televisions with built-in Roku streaming.  Roku has 15 million monthly active accounts as of June 30, 2017 that streamed in the last 30 days. It accounted for nearly half of all over-the-top streaming devices in the United States last year, according to market research firm comScore. Roku has accumulated a number of big-media investors over the years including Viacom Inc, 21st Century Fox Inc, Hearst and Dish Network Corp.

400,FOX,"Twenty-First Century Fox revenue misses, profit tops estimates","(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch-controlled Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s quarterly profit edged past analysts’ estimates, but revenue fell just short of expectations, hurt by the lack of box office hits from its movie studio. The media company, which is seeking regulatory approval to completely buy out Sky Plc, said revenue at its filmed entertainment division fell 11.5 percent to $1.80 billion in the fourth quarter. Fox said the lower home entertainment revenue was due to the strong performance of superhero movie “Deadpool” in the year-ago quarter. The company’s shares were roughly flat in after hours trading. Fox reported fourth-quarter results as investors questioned whether it would gain British government approval for its $14.5 billion bid to buy the nearly 61 percent of UK-based pay-TV group Sky it does not own. That deal is still under review by British regulators and is likely to be referred to the competition watchdog for a full investigation. Its approval has been met with a number of roadblocks, including British media secretary Karen Bradley’s reservations that it gives the Murdoch family too much influence over the media. James Murdoch CEO of Fox said on a post-earnings call that Fox was confident the deal would be approved, but more likely in the first half of 2018 than this year.  Fox reported that revenue from its cable division, which houses the Fox News and FX channels among others, rose 10.4 percent and accounted for more than half of total revenue. Fox expected to see high single digit domestic affiliate fee growth every quarter in fiscal 2018, the company said on its call. Overall, executives expressed optimism about the growth of “skinny bundles,” or streaming services with smaller groups of networks at a cheaper price than cable and satellite services, and their effect on Fox’s business.  However, the company did not rule out launching its own direct to consumer online streaming service.  “We remain very open-minded about an independently priced direct-to-consumer offering as well,” Murdoch said.

403,FOX,Sky investor Odey says Fox bid is losing appeal,"LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey has said he is considering withdrawing his support for Twenty-First Century Fox’s attempt to take over Sky , saying he believes the 11.7 billion pound ($15.20 billion) deal undervalues the British broadcaster. Odey, who is the 15th biggest Sky shareholder with a 1 percent stake according to Thomson Reuters data, had said he backed the bid when it was announced in December. However, he told Reuters that regulatory delays have prompted him to reconsider his support for Fox’s 10.75 pound a share offer for the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own. His change of stance comes after Rupert Murdoch’s attempt to take full control of Sky faced another obstacle when the British government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said on Tuesday it had asked communications regulator Ofcom to re-examine the deal. “The truth is, the longer this goes on the more that I would be quite happy if it failed,” Odey said, adding that Fox is “getting it at what now looks like quite a cheap price” and that the offer is “now starting to look rather mean.” Odey said in a telephone interview his view of the deal was changing because he thought Sky’s prospects were improving. The investor clashed with the broadcaster three years ago when he initially rejected its offer to acquire his fund’s shares in Sky Deutschland as part of its takeover of the German business. A spokesman at Sky declined to comment. Sky shares fell on Tuesday following the announcement that Ofcom had been asked to do more analysis on the deal, adding another delay that unnerved investors. The stock was trading on Wednesday at 955.5 pence, the lowest level since December when news of the deal broke. A source close to Sky cautioned that at the current share price, Fox’s offer remains competitive. However, he acknowledged that the longer the deal takes the higher the risk is that investors may change their views on valuation. Murdoch has long sought to take full control of Sky but has faced political opposition. An earlier attempt to take over the broadcaster was abandoned in 2011 amid a furore over a phone-hacking scandal at the now-defunct News of the World, a paper the billionaire had owned.

Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) agreed to take full control of the European pay-TV group Sky in December, but the British government is still deciding whether to refer the deal for a full investigation which could add many months to the approval process. It asked regulator Ofcom to look again at certain aspects of the deal in August and said on Monday it would carefully consider the advice before taking a final decision.

413,FOX,Rupert Murdoch's Fox joins court challenge to CBS' Australian TV buyout,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc joined a court challenge on Tuesday against rival U.S. cable network CBS Corp’s proposed buyout of struggling Australian television broadcaster Ten Network Holdings Ltd. The U.S. broadcasting heavyweights faced off in the Australian courtroom amid a battle for control of Ten, a ratings laggard which went into administration three months ago following long declines in viewership and advertising revenue. Lawyers for Ten said the private company of Murdoch’s son, Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch, had offered to revise the offer it made in June before it was elbowed aside by CBS. Murdoch’s company Illyria and its Australian partner had informed Ten overnight on Monday that they “wish to in some way reopen their offer by opening negotiations”, Ten lawyer Richard McHugh told the court. Illyria’s offer has not been disclosed but McHugh said the company had still not provided anything that could be put to Ten’s creditors. Documents released on Monday by the administrator show CBS, the free-to-air network’s major creditor, is prepared to pay at least A$201.1 million ($162 million) in cash for Ten.  While Ten was worth less than A$60 million when it went into administration, it is an attractive takeover target because of its national reach and strong brand recognition in the world’s 12th-largest economy. Twenty-First Century Fox and CBS are Ten’s largest creditors. Lachlan Murdoch and his Australian co-bidder, television entrepreneur Bruce Gordon, were also major Ten shareholders. Gordon filed the court action seeking to delay the CBS takeover, arguing the administrators had not properly informed creditors of their options. After New South Wales state Supreme Court Judge Ashley Black agreed to let Twenty-First Century Fox join Gordon’s action, a lawyer for the U.S. company said the terms of the CBS offer were unfair. “They are getting 100 cents in the dollar and we seem to be getting 1.75 cents in the dollar,” lawyer Ian Pike told the court. Pike did not refer to a rival offer from Lachlan Murdoch and Gordon, but Gordon’s lawyer, Andrew Bell, told the court his client was concerned administrators “made the decision not to put the competing (offer) to the creditors”.

419,FOX,UPDATE 4-Judge Fox bid for Sky on merits not politics -James Murdoch,"CAMBRIDGE, England (Reuters) - Britain should judge Rupert Murdoch’s bid for broadcaster Sky (SKYB.L) on facts and not politics or risk stifling inward investment after Brexit, his son and fellow executive James Murdoch said on Thursday. Appearing before an audience of media executives hours after the government referred Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) $15 billion bid for a detailed investigation, James Murdoch struck a combative tone in defense of his family’s record in building global businesses that span TV, film and news.  He was confident, he said, that the country’s independent regulators would assess the deal on its merits and not be swayed by politicians with scores to settle over how his father’s newspapers had treated them over the decades. “Whether or not 30 years ago someone had a grievance about a political position that a newspaper took ... is irrelevant,” Murdoch, who is CEO of Twenty-First Century Fox and chairman of Sky, said at the Royal Television Society’s Cambridge Convention. “We have a clock on this now. We are confident it goes through.”  The Murdochs returned to buy full control of Sky in December 2016, more than five years after a phone-hacking scandal at their now-defunct News of the World tabloid newspaper sank a previous attempt. Since that failure they have split their company in two, separating the newspapers from the entertainment assets to help to smooth the deal’s passage deal.  But their reputation remains damaged in Britain after a public inquiry revealed close ties between Rupert Murdoch and prime ministers Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and David Cameron, creating the impression of a puppet master pulling the strings of the country’s politicians.  Theresa May’s government has been much more cautious, referring the bid for lengthy investigations and in one instance ignoring the advice of media regulator Ofcom, which had cleared it on grounds of broadcasting standards. James Murdoch cast himself as apolitical, saying his own opinions did not influence the way he runs a group that made content ranging from The Simpsons cartoon to the award-winning Sky News and movies such as Avatar. “My politics are not an issue here,” he said.  “It’s an irony that in the U.S., in some sectors, they think I’m a raging liberal environmentalist tree hugger, and here I’m the right-wing demon who is going to Foxify everything.”  Asked if he had spoken to the government about a separate investigation into newspaper ethics, he replied: “The government won’t take a meeting with me.”  Media Secretary Karen Bradley told the same conference that she had referred the deal to the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) to give the public confidence in the regulatory process.  “I want (the CMA) to look at the concerns that have been raised. You will see when we publish all the information on this exactly why the referral has been made,” she said.  To secure the deal Fox will now need to prove it can uphold broadcasting standards during a six-month review that follows a series of sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuits at the Fox News network in the United States.  Asked if the Murdochs could be trusted after presiding over scandals at their British newspapers and later at Fox News, James Murdoch said the company had dealt with the problems effectively.  He defended his stewardship of Sky, saying that few others had invested as much and over such a long period. He added that the issue of inward investment would become even more important as the country prepares to leave the European Union.  “If the UK truly is open for business post-Brexit we’ll look forward to moving through the regulatory review process and this transformative transaction for the UK creative sector becoming an affirmation of that claim,” he said.  The government has given the CMA 24 weeks to examine the deal. It will make recommendations, including any possible remedies, to Bradley.  “I must then come to a final decision on whether or not the merger can proceed,” Bradley told parliament on Thursday. Sky shares dipped by 0.4 percent to 928.5 pence on Thursday, well below the 10.75 pounds per share offered by the Murdochs for the 61 percent of the company they do not already own.

Twenty-First Century Fox’s $15 billion bid for Sky was earlier on Thursday referred to the country’s competition watchdog for a 24-week investigation to examine the impact it would have on broadcasting standards and media plurality. James Murdoch, speaking at the RTS Conference in Cambridge, said a green light for the deal would show the world that Britain remained open for inward investment as it prepares to leave the European Union. He also said the regulator should ignore the politics and noise around the deal, saying grievances sparked by Rupert Murdoch’s British newspapers over the decades should not play a role in takeover deals. “Remove the noise and get to the facts,” he said (Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Kate Holton)",9142017,http://www.reuters.com/article/sky-ma-fox-murdoch/backing-sky-deal-would-show-uk-open-after-brexit-james-murdoch-idUSL9N1JJ00F

425,FOX,Murdoch opponent challenges UK regulator over Sky deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Activist group Avaaz stepped up its battle to stop Rupert Murdoch buying Sky (SKYB.L), launching a legal challenge to the regulator’s view that the pay-TV group would still be a “fit and proper” owner of a broadcasting license if the deal goes ahead. Britain’s broadcasting regulator Ofcom ran a “fit and proper” test when it assessed whether the $15 billion deal to bring Sky under the full control of Murdoch’s Fox (FOXA.O)  should be reviewed on the grounds of broadcasting standards and media plurality. It said in June that if Sky were fully owned by Twenty-First Century Fox, it would still be “fit and proper” to hold a broadcasting license, and also said it had no serious concerns about Fox’s commitment to broadcasting standards. Despite Ofcom’s recommendations, Britain’s Culture Secretary  Karen Bradley decided this month to refer the deal to a wide-ranging review on the grounds of broadcasting standards and media plurality, which looks at Murdoch’s influence across  Britain’s newspaper and broadcasters. Online pressure group Avaaz said it was filing papers in court on Friday seeking a judicial review of Ofcom’s “fit and proper” decision. It claims Ofcom did not correctly assess standards at Fox News and the track record of Fox CEO James Murdoch, Rupert’s son, who was responsible for Murdoch’s British newspapers during a phone-hacking scandal in 2011. “Repeated, large-scale scandals in the Murdoch empire indicate that something is very rotten at the core of their businesses,” said Avaaz campaign director Alex Wilks.  “Ofcom didn’t dig deep enough before declaring the Murdochs fit to own even more of our media.”  Ofcom said it would defend its ruling. “We will defend our ‘fit and proper’ assessment, which was independent, expert and based on the evidence,” a spokesman said. James Murdoch said earlier this month that the deal should be assessed solely on the evidence and not to settle political scores. “Whether or not 30 years ago someone had a grievance about a political position that a newspaper took ... is irrelevant,” James Murdoch, who is CEO of Fox and chairman of Sky, said at the Royal Television Society’s Cambridge Convention.

427,FOX,"In shadow of Fox bid, James Murdoch re-elected Sky chairman","LONDON (Reuters) - James Murdoch was re-elected as Sky (SKYB.L) chairman by a slim majority of independent shareholders on Thursday, despite questions being raised about whether he can be neutral due to his role as chief executive at bidder Twenty-First Century Fox. The Murdoch family’s Fox (FOXA.O) is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own. Its bid, which is strongly opposed by some lawmakers and is subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny, hangs over the European pay-TV group, which reported quarterly results earlier on Thursday. The British government referred Fox’s $15 billion bid for a detailed investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last month to assess the Murdoch family’s commitment to British broadcasting standards and its influence in the media. Royal London, which holds a 44 million pound ($58 million) stake in Sky, was one of the investors which planned to vote against James Murdoch’s re-election, saying he could not effectively represent independent shareholders while he was chief executive of Fox. Its view was not held by the majority, however, with Murdoch winning the backing of 51 percent. A year ago he was opposed by a narrow majority, but he was secure thanks to the 39 percent stake held by his family. Murdoch told the meeting that he expected the regulatory process to conclude by the middle of 2018. “On both sides, Twenty-First Century Fox and Sky, both are engaged constructively with the regulatory authorities, and I am confident we will get to a conclusion by the middle of next year,” he said. James Murdoch was questioned about corporate governance at Twenty-First Century Fox, where there have been allegations of sexual and racial harassment.  “Are you confident that the CMA won’t unearth new Fox scandals which derail the bid?,” Alaphia Zoyab from activist group Avaaz asked. Murdoch passed the question to independent director Martin Gilbert, who led an independent board assessment of the Fox bid. “I am not going to comment on the Twenty-First Century Fox issues because this is the AGM of Sky, but I am pretty confident that it will not have an effect on the CMA’s investigation,” he said. Earlier on Thursday, Sky reported like-for-like first-quarter revenue of 3.3 billion pounds ($4.4 billion) and core earnings of 582 million pounds, up 11 percent in the three months to end of September. “We are especially pleased with the strength of the company’s performance given the challenging consumer environment,” Murdoch said. Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said Sky was growing both revenue and profit in a tougher consumer market thanks to its new products, and a TV line-up that includes thriller “Riviera”, its most successful original production to date, and “Game of Thrones”. Sky offers broadband and fixed and mobile telecoms in addition to pay-TV in its biggest market in Britain and Ireland, as well as pay-TV in Germany, Austria and Italy. “We continue to see strong customer demand for our products and services, so net customer additions in the quarter are 50 percent higher than last year,” Darroch told reporters. “The total number of subscription products in our base of homes now sits comfortably above 60 million.” He said the company was seeing good demand for its flagship Sky Q product as well as for its streaming service Now TV.  “Our growth is coming at the top and at the entry end as well,” he said. Sky’s shares were trading at 9.29 pounds at 1505 GMT, up 1.7 percent but still well adrift of the 10.75 pounds-a-share offer.

Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said Sky was growing both revenue and profit in a tougher consumer market thanks to its new products, and a TV line-up that includes thriller “Riviera”, its most successful original production to date, and “Game of Thrones”. Sky offers broadband and fixed and mobile telecoms in addition to pay-TV in its biggest market in Britain and Ireland, as well as pay-TV in Germany, Austria and Italy. “We continue to see strong customer demand for our products and services, so net customer additions in the quarter are 50 percent higher than last year,” Darroch told reporters. “The total number of subscription products in our base of homes now sits comfortably above 60 million.” He said the company was seeing good demand for its flagship Sky Q product as well as for its streaming service Now TV.  “Our growth is coming at the top and at the entry end as well,” he said. Sky’s shares were trading at 9.29 pounds at 1505 GMT, up 1.7 percent but still well adrift of the 10.75 pounds-a-share offer.

429,FOX,James Murdoch wins backing of Sky shareholders to stay as chairman,"LONDON (Reuters) - A majority of independent votes cast at the annual shareholders’ meeting of Sky (SKYB.L) on Thursday supported the re-election of James Murdoch as chairman, a spokesman for the European pay TV group said. Ahead of the meeting some shareholders had said they were planning to oppose Murdoch’s re-election because they did not believe he could effectively represent independent investors as he is also chief executive of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O). Twenty-First Century Fox, which already owns 39 percent of Sky, agreed to buy the rest of the company in December 2016, a deal which is currently being reviewed by Britain’s competition regulators. At Sky’s AGM, independent director Martin Gilbert said he was “pretty confident” past events at Fox News in the United States would not affect the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s current review of the deal. Gilbert’s comment was a reference to allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News.

He added: “The interesting thing is: can Sky survive happily without Fox? I think it can quite happily.” Odey initially said he backed the Fox bid to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own, which was first announced in December.

440,FOX,UPDATE 1-Sky investor Odey opposes Fox bid as Disney talks fuel uncertainty,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investor Crispin Odey said he opposed Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) $15 billion bid for Sky (SKYB.L) after a report of separate talks between Rupert Murdoch and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) added more uncertainty to a takeover facing regulatory hurdles. Veteran hedge fund manager Odey, whose firm has a 0.9 percent Sky stake according to Thomson Reuters data, said that Fox’s 10.75 pound-a-share bid “starts to look like it’s not a very good price” for the European pay-TV broadcaster. Odey’s opposition to the 11.7 billion-pound ($15.4 billion) takeover comes after CNBC reported that Murdoch’s Fox had recently held talks about selling some assets to Disney. That scenario added to the potential obstacles to the Sky deal which faces an in-depth regulatory investigation and strong opposition from some British politicians. “I’d vote against the deal,” Odey told Reuters on Tuesday, when asked about Fox’s offer for the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own. He added: “The interesting thing is: can Sky survive happily without Fox? I think it can quite happily.” Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch, had initially backed the Fox bid for Sky, which was announced in December. But in August he told Reuters that he thought the offer was beginning to “look rather mean”, although he stopped short of saying he would oppose it.  Sky shares traded 1.2 percent lower at 928 pence by 1520 GMT on Tuesday, well below the bid price. Odey said that he had changed his mind because Sky’s financial results have been “much better than people forecast” , since the offer was made. Last month, the British broadcaster posted an 11 percent rise in core earnings to 582 million pounds for the three months to the end of September. Odey’s comments come after CNBC said that Disney recently discussed buying Fox’s movie and TV production studio studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic and international assets such as the Star network in India and its stake in Sky. The talks were not currently ongoing, the broadcaster said. Analysts at Liberum said they still saw a successful conclusion of Fox’s bid for Sky as the most likely outcome, but the Disney-Fox talks had thrown a curveball into the mix. They said Fox may scrap its bid for Sky as part of a proposed sale of assets, and they also noted that Fox’s willingness to consider including the Sky stake in any sale could be seen as a signal that it feels less confident of gaining regulatory approval from the British government. UBS, however, said a combination of Disney and Fox content could strengthen the rationale for buying all of Sky. The British company was already starting to build a pan-European streaming platform with its Now TV and Sky Ticket products, and the addition of content from Disney as well as Fox would only make that more compelling, it said. The bank also said in the event that a Fox/Sky deal was blocked, based on the CNBC article, Disney could be a potential strategic bidder for Sky and it noted it would not have the cross-media complications of a Fox bid.  Fox and Sky both declined to comment. ",11072017,http://www.reuters.com/article/fox-ma-walt-disney-sky-plc/update-1-sky-investor-odey-opposes-fox-bid-as-disney-talks-fuel-uncertainty-idUSL5N1ND5U3

448,FOX,Twenty-First Century Fox's quarterly revenue beats Street,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) quarterly revenue topped market estimates on Wednesday as higher sales from traditional and online distributors boosted its cable business. The Rupert Murdoch-controlled company’s shares were up nearly 1 percent in extended trading. The first-quarter results come after CNBC reported on Monday that Fox had, in the last few weeks, held talks about selling most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). The two sides are not currently in discussion, CNBC had reported. At the beginning of a call with analysts, Fox’s Chairman Lachlan Murdoch, without naming Disney, said that the company would not respond to any questions regarding recent media reports. However when asked if Fox was the right size or had the right set of assets, CEO James Murdoch said he liked the brands the company has. “These are big brands that really matter for their customers and we like where we are,” he said. The reported talks with Disney adds another layer of uncertainty to Fox’s bid to buy the rest the nearly 61 percent of European pay-TV group Sky Plc (SKYB.L) it does not already own in an offer worth $14.5 billion made in December. The offer is being closely scrutinized by the British government. Nevertheless, Fox said Wednesday it expects the deal to close by June 30, 2018.  Revenue from Fox’s cable division, which houses the Fox News and FX channels among others, rose 10 percent to $4.20 billion. That beat analysts’ average estimate of $4.12 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Domestic affiliate revenue, which consists of sales from its traditional and online distributors, jumped 11 percent. Affiliate sales helped offset an 11 percent increase in expenses, primarily due to higher global sports programming costs. In September, Fox’s Star India bid $2.55 billion for the television and streaming rights combined to a hugely popular cricket tournament in India. Fox expects those rights to add 2 percent of cost growth and revenue in the fourth quarter, Fox told analysts. Despite that increase, Fox said it was not concerned about the increasing cost of sports rights.  Fox said revenue rose to $7.00 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, higher than the $6.51 billion a year earlier and the $6.81 billion analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

However when asked if Fox was the right size or had the right set of assets, CEO James Murdoch said he liked the brands the company has. “These are big brands that really matter for their customers and we like where we are,” he said. The reported talks with Disney adds another layer of uncertainty to Fox’s bid to buy the rest the nearly 61 percent of European pay-TV group Sky Plc (SKYB.L) it does not already own in an offer worth $14.5 billion made in December. The offer is being closely scrutinized by the British government. Nevertheless, Fox said Wednesday it expects the deal to close by June 30, 2018.  Revenue from Fox’s cable division, which houses the Fox News and FX channels among others, rose 10 percent to $4.20 billion. That beat analysts’ average estimate of $4.12 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Domestic affiliate revenue, which consists of sales from its traditional and online distributors, jumped 11 percent. Affiliate sales helped offset an 11 percent increase in expenses, primarily due to higher global sports programming costs. In September, Fox’s Star India bid $2.55 billion for the television and streaming rights combined to a hugely popular cricket tournament in India. Fox expects those rights to add 2 percent of cost growth and revenue in the fourth quarter, Fox told analysts. Despite that increase, Fox said it was not concerned about the increasing cost of sports rights.  Fox said revenue rose to $7.00 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, higher than the $6.51 billion a year earlier and the $6.81 billion analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

450,FOX,Twenty-First Century Fox's first-quarter revenue rises,"Nov 8 (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc reported a 7.6 percent rise first-quarter revenue on Wednesday, as higher advertising sales boosted its cable business. Fox said revenue rose to $7.00 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $6.51 billion a year earlier. Net income attributable to shareholders increased to $855 million, or 46 cents per share, from $821 million, or 44 cents per share. The results come after CNBC reported on Monday that Fox had, in the last few weeks, held talks about selling most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co. The two sides are not currently in discussion, CNBC had reported. Fox did not address the report in its quarterly report.

Murdoch has repeatedly stated that deal would be approved in the first half of 2018. “Absent further delays, the transaction is expected to close by June 30, 2018,” Fox said on Wednesday.

451,FOX,Wednesday Morning Briefing,"Democrats score a victory in Virginia, Trump arrives in China to seek help reigning in North Korea and FBI agents raid the headquarters of a major U.S. body broker.  Democrat Ralph Northam won a bitter race for Virginia governor, dealing a setback to President Donald Trump with a decisive victory over a Republican who had adopted some of the president’s combative tactics and issues.   Reuters TV: Northam gives Democrats hope.  Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio scored a decisive victory in his bid to secure a second four-year term in charge of the United States’ biggest city.   A Democratic Senator said he wants answers from top Justice Department officials about why a career prosecutor was asked to resign days before a special counsel unveiled the first criminal charges in an investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election.    Federal agents have seized records from a national company that solicits thousands of Americans to donate their bodies to science each year, then profits by dissecting the parts and distributing them for use by researchers and educators. Read the exclusive and Reuters’ series on the body broker industry.    With lavish pageantry and an uncharacteristic personal flourish, Chinese President Xi Jinping rolled out a red carpet welcome for Trump at the Forbidden City, the ancient home of China’s emperors.    Trump arrived in China seeking help to rein in North Korea after warning the North’s leader that the nuclear weapons he is developing “are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger.”    Neighbours say when three men kicked down the doors and burgled the home of a North Korean diplomat in Islamabad last month, it took them more than three hours to lug out their booty: thousands of bottles of Scotch whisky, beer and French wine.

However, at the close of trading of that session, Dow futures had reversed the drop to close up nearly 250 points, above 18,500. That is the lowest they have been since then.

455,FOX,Fox in the Mouse House could give Disney an edge in streaming wars,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - If Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) buys some Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) businesses, it could provide a quick path for the traditional media giant to create a substantial competitor to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) in the battle for TV and movie viewers. The two companies reportedly held talks in recent weeks about a potential sale of Fox’s FX and National Geographic channels, its movie studio and some other international assets to Disney, according to media reports. The discussions had stopped as of Monday but could restart, the reports said. Television viewers have been rapidly embracing online services like Netflix over traditional pay TV packages, a shift that is enticing deep-pocketed technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) into video offerings. Investors who have driven Netflix shares to record highs this year were selling on Tuesday, sending the company’s stock down more than 2 percent. Disney and Fox shares rose roughly 1 percent each as analysts said a deal between the two media giants could benefit Disney’s planned streaming push. “It could be very formidable,” said Bruce Tuchman, a media investor, entrepreneur and adviser to streaming services like iflix. “They wouldn’t have to leave the confines of their own company to build a competitive service.” Disney announced in August it was pulling its first-run movies from Netflix starting in 2019 to put them on a Disney-branded service.  With Fox, Disney in the future could yank Fox programming from Netflix and put shows like “The Simpsons” and movie franchises including “Avatar” alongside Disney classics such as “Beauty and the Beast” plus “Star Wars” and Marvel films.  That would leave a hole in Netflix. Fox made up 17 percent of Netflix’s top-rated shows by IMDb as of June, while Disney made up 7 percent, according to MoffettNathanson and YipitData.  Disney and Fox also each own roughly 25 percent of streaming service Hulu, which could serve as another platform for content.  Disney, Fox and Netflix had no comment. In August, Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, told Reuters that his company was investing more in its own programming to counter moves by traditional media companies.  “That’s why we got into the originals business five years ago, anticipating it may be not as easy a conversation with studios and networks” to license their programming, Sarandos said. Netflix plans to spend $8 billion on content next year, the company has said. Disney spent $13.5 billion on content in fiscal 2017, about half of it on sports programming, according to MoffettNathanson estimates. Disney will be starting its online service more than a decade after Netflix, which now boasts 109 million streaming customers around the world. Disney could expand its global reach if it acquires Fox TV channel Star India and the company’s stake in European pay TV provider Sky Plc (SKYB.L), which already has made inroads in the streaming market. Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin said Disney needs to buy a film library from Fox or another big company to compete directly with Netflix. “Disney’s libraries are very high quality, but they are very small,” Martin said. “They could not do it alone.” ",11082017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-walt-disney-netflix-fox-analysis/fox-in-the-mouse-house-could-give-disney-an-edge-in-streaming-wars-idUSKBN1D801X

460,FOX,Disney shares rise as focus turns to streaming commitment,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney’s (DIS.N) shares rose 3 percent on Friday, as Wall Street shrugged off poor financial results and focused instead on the media giant’s commitment to build a service that will compete aggressively with video streaming pioneer Netflix. Disney’s sharper focus on streaming comes amid subscriber losses at its legacy cable networks that include ESPN and ABC, which many viewers are deserting for cheaper, on-demand streaming options. On Thursday, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger talked up his commitment to streaming, calling it the company’s “highest priority this year.” In a step that will further cement Disney’s strong position as a content powerhouse, Iger also unveiled a deal to develop a new “Star Wars” trilogy. Perhaps more importantly, Iger said Disney’s planned streaming service would be “substantially” cheaper than Netflix. Analysts said the lower price likely reflected Disney’s relatively smaller content slate but that the move could help the service gain subscribers quickly. “We think Disney wants strong uptake early on and that this move recognizes that the equity market rewards strong (streaming) subscriber growth,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall said. To compete better with Netflix and other streaming services, Disney has also said it will keep new Disney releases out of Netflix, starting from 2019. Disney was making all the right strategic decisions as it builds out the streaming business, Evercore ISI’s Vijay Jayant said. The company is developing family-friendly streaming services that will sell directly to consumers. It will launch a sports-focused service called ESPN Plus in early 2018.

461,FOX,US STOCKS-Wall St falls on tax bill worries; media stocks climb,"* All three major indexes on track to post weekly losses * Walt Disney gains; top boost on the Dow * Nvidia rises as revenue forecast tops estimates * Indexes down: Dow 0.19 pct, S&P; 0.24 pct, Nasdaq 0.22 pct (Adds details, changes comment, updates prices) By Tanya Agrawal Nov 10 (Reuters) - Wall Street declined on Friday as the markets grappled with concerns over delays in corporate tax cuts but a rise in media stocks helped limit the slide. Walt Disney rose 2.9 percent as the promise of a new film trilogy overshadowed weak quarterly results and struggles at the media company. The stock was the biggest boost on the Dow. Disney held talks in recent weeks about buying some of Twenty-First Century Fox’s film and TV businesses, according to media reports. Twenty-First Century Fox, Time Warner Inc, Comcast and News Corp were all up between 1.4 percent and 6.1 percent and were among the top boosts on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Senate Republicans have unveiled a tax-cut plan that would delay lowering corporate rate to 20 percent by a year and provide small-business owners with a deduction rather than a special business rate. The Senate Republicans’ version of the bill differs markedly on corporate, business and individual tax cuts from legislation detailed by their counterparts in the House of Representatives. The S&P; 500 index has surged more than 20 percent since the 2016 presidential election, fueled by Donald Trump’s promises. All three major indexes were on track to end lower for the week, with the S&P; and the Dow on track to post weekly losses after eight straight weeks of gains. “When you get to the end of the earnings season, the focus shifts from the micro to the macro, in this case, the tax bill,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. “The concerns over the differences between the Senate and House version of the tax bill is causing some consolidation in the market. It’s a pretty tight time frame for the passage of the bill and I think it will be an event for the first quarter.” At 10:47 a.m. ET (1447 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 43.85 points, or 0.19 percent, at 23,418.09, the S&P; 500 was down 6.28 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,578.34. The Nasdaq Composite was down 15.06 points, or 0.22 percent, at 6,734.99. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the healthcare index’s 1.17 percent fall leading the decliners. Earnings for the third quarter are expected to have climbed 8 percent, compared with expectations of a 5.9 percent rise at the start of October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Nvidia were up 5.5 percent after the chipmaker’s revenue forecast for the current quarter topped estimates. Nordstrom fell 2.1 percent after its quarterly same-store sales came in below expectations, while J.C. Penney was up 12.7 percent after the department store chain reported third-quarter same-store sales that were twice what it had estimated. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,432 to 1,244. On the Nasdaq, 1,455 issues rose and 1,209 fell.

463,FOX,New 'Star Wars' trilogy raises hopes after Disney results miss target,"(Reuters) - The force of “Star Wars” lifted Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) shares on Thursday as the promise of a new film trilogy overshadowed disappointing quarterly results and struggles at the media company’s television business. The storied movie studio and theme park operator is scrambling to keep viewers who are abandoning its current top money maker, cable networks. The power of its characters and brands are the reason many investors stick with the company despite its challenges. Disney shares rose more than 1 percent after Chief Executive Bob Iger said Disney had struck a deal with Rian Johnson, director of upcoming film “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” to create a new trilogy in the blockbuster science fiction series. A live-action “Star Wars” TV series also is being developed for a streaming service that Disney is launching to capture online audiences, Iger said.  Disney shares rose about 1 percent from their Thursday closing price to $103.57 after the “Star Wars” announcements, reversing an initial falloff after Disney’s results raised concerns about cable subscriptions.  Subscribers and advertising revenue both fell at ESPN, the sports powerhouse that is seen as a proxy for Disney’s ability to fight the rapid migration of audiences to online viewing. Affiliate revenue rose and overall results at ESPN were comparable to the prior year for the quarter that ended in September, Disney said. Total revenue from Disney’s cable business, the largest unit which includes ESPN and the Disney Channel, fell marginally to $3.95 billion in the fourth quarter, missing the $4.06 billion consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. To address challenges in its TV networks business, Disney is developing family-friendly streaming services that it will sell directly to consumers to compete with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and other rivals. Building those businesses tops the company’s agenda for the next year, Iger told analysts on a conference call. “We believe creating a direct-to-consumer relationship is vital to the future of our media businesses, and it’s our highest priority this year,” he said. New Disney releases will go to the company’s own service rather than Netflix, starting in 2019, and Iger on Thursday said the new service would be priced “substantially below” Netflix, a reflection of having less content. Disney’s sports-focused service will launch in early 2018 and will be called ESPN Plus, Iger said. Investors remain concerned about Disney’s cable business and were buoyed by the potential of the “Star Wars” franchise and the pricing of the streaming service, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said. “The Last Jedi,” hitting theaters in December, could ring up $2 billion in global box office sales, he said. Disney shares have had a difficult year, falling roughly 1 percent, while the S&P; 500 has risen 15 percent.  Disney also held talks in recent weeks about buying some of Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) film and TV businesses, according to media reports, which could bring Disney more content to compete with Netflix and others. Disney did not comment on the Fox talks on the call with investors. Disney recently traded at 16 times expected earnings, compared with 14 times earnings for Time Warner and 13 times earnings for Fox, according to Thomson Reuters data. A two-day closing of Disney’s Florida resorts amid a hurricane and the cancellation of an animated movie were among one-time items that reduced operating income by about $275 million, or about 11 cents per share, the company said. Disney’s movie business generated revenue of $1.4 billion in the quarter, down about 21 percent and missing analysts’ average estimate of $1.61 billion. Broadcast revenue of $1.51 billion missed Wall Street’s target of $1.69 million, and Disney’s theme parks posted revenue of $4.67 billion, just missing expectations of $4.70 billion. Disney’s total revenue fell to $12.78 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $13.14 billion a year earlier. Net income attributable to the company declined to $1.75 billion from $1.77 billion. Excluding items, it earned $1.07 per share. Analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of $1.13 per share and revenue to rise to $13.23 billion.

469,FOX,Narrow win for Fox shows restlessness with dual-class shares,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A shareholder proposal calling for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to scrap its dual-class share structure was rejected on Wednesday, although the measure received significant support among voters outside the controlling Murdoch family. Fifty-seven percent of votes cast sided with the position of Fox’s board, which argued that the current share structure provided flexibility and enhanced the company’s ability to focus on long-term results, a Fox regulatory filing said. The majority of Fox shares traded publicly are class A shares, which have no voting rights. The Murdoch family owns about 39 percent of the class B voting shares, according to a proxy from the company, which owns the Fox broadcast network, cable channels and a movie studio. Critics argue that the current set-up concentrates too much power with the Murdoch family. Forty-three percent of votes cast were in favor of eliminating the two classes of shares and giving all shares a vote. The vote was advisory, so passage would not have forced any changes at the company. Even so, it was noteworthy that more than half of shareholders outside of the Murdoch’s control voted in favor, said Paul Hodgson, an independent governance consultant. In addition to the family stake, 6.7 percent of the voting shares are held by ValueAct Capital, whose chief executive, Jeff Ubben, is also a Fox director. “The message the public shareholders are sending management is get rid of the dual voting class of shares,” Hodgson said. The measure’s supporters may use the results to try to persuade Fox management to meet with them to discuss the issue, he added. Kevin McManus, a vice president of proxy adviser Egan Jones, said the number of people voting against the dual voting class  marked “a very significant percentage and puts pressure on the company.” Laura Campos, a director at the reform measure’s sponsor, the Nathan Cummings Foundation, said Fox’s structure made change unlikely despite the result. “At many companies, 43 percent would be more than enough to prompt serious action from the board. At a company with a dual-class capital structure, it’s less likely that we’ll see any sort of substantive response from the board,” she said via email. Asked about the result, a Fox spokesman sent remarks by director Viet Dinh, who said at the company’s annual meeting that the board believed the current structure was valued by shareholders. “The board believes that many are attracted to our stock by the dual class structure and stability and leadership provided by the Murdoch family, both of which have contributed to the long-term success of the company,” Dinh said. Major mutual fund firms have been pushing the importance of equal voting rights as a way to improve the way companies are run. Fund executives worry about cases like technology initial public offerings such as Snap Inc, which offered outside investors no voting rights. The fear is that unequal voting structures concentrate too much power in the hands of insiders.     At a 26-minute annual meeting on Fox’s movie and television studio lot in Los Angeles, shareholders on Wednesday also easily re-elected Rupert Murdoch and his two sons to the company’s board, suggesting continued support for the family even as its Fox News division is recovering from a series of costly sexual harassment settlements.  That issue has slowed Britain’s regulatory review of the company’s bid to take over broadcaster Sky Plc. Co-Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch, speaking at the annual meeting, said the company was confident the deal would close by the middle of next year. Fox also has recently talked to Walt Disney Co about selling much of itself, according to a CNBC report. The company did not directly address that matter during the meeting but said it was confident in its current assets. “We have the required scale to continue to execute on our aggressive growth strategy,” Lachlan Murdoch said.  The proposed new voting structure is aimed at beefing up investor oversight over Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James, who are all Fox board members.  “This structure leaves some shareholders with disproportionate voting power and others with none at all. We think eliminating it would benefit the shareholders and the company,” said Roxana Tynan, speaking on behalf of the foundation. The current structure, she said, “can create corporate cultures with no accountability.”  On another advisory measure, 78 percent of votes cast were in support of Fox executives’ annual compensation.

471,FOX,21st Century Fox in $90 mln settlement tied to sexual harassment scandal,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has reached a $90 million settlement of shareholder claims arising from the sexual harassment scandal at its Fox News Channel, which cost the jobs of longtime news chief Roger Ailes and anchor Bill O’Reilly. The settlement, which requires a judge’s approval, resolves what are known as “derivative” claims against Fox officers and directors, including: Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, who are Fox’s executive chairmen; James Murdoch, another son and its chief executive, and Ailes’ estate. The defendants did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement filed with the Delaware Chancery Court. Monday’s settlement calls for insurers of Fox officers, Fox directors and Ailes’ estate to pay the $90 million to the New York-based company for the benefit of shareholders. Fox will enhance governance and said it created the Fox News Workplace Professionalism and Inclusion Council to ensure a proper workplace environment, bolster training and further the recruitment and advancement of women and minorities. The council has four independent members, including former federal judge Barbara Jones. In a typical derivative case, shareholders sue in the name of a company to remedy wrongs inflicted by an alleged lack of oversight by a company’s officers and directors. Ailes’ estate disputed many of the allegations in the settlement, which was reached before a complaint was formally filed, court records show. “The Workplace Council gives our management team access to a braintrust of experts with deep and diverse experiences in workplace issues,” Jack Abernethy, co-president of Fox News Channel, said in a statement. “We look forward to benefiting from their collective guidance.” Shareholders were led by the City of Monroe Employees’ Retirement System in Michigan. Their lawyer, Max Berger, said in a statement the accord would provide “meaningful benefits” for shareholders and Fox News employees. The accord is not the first big derivative settlement involving a Murdoch-led company. In 2013, former Fox parent News Corp reached a $139 million settlement of derivative claims that its board turned a blind eye to phone hacking at its London tabloids. Two years later, the Delaware court approved a $275 million settlement involving “Call of Duty” videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc over a stock sale by Vivendi SA. The scandal at Fox began in July 2016 when former anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit accusing Ailes of harassment. O’Reilly lost his job in April after being accused of harassment, and has denied wrongdoing.  Ailes died the next month. Fox faces other private civil litigation tied to the scandal.

473,FOX,UPDATE 1-Fox's Lachlan Murdoch says company would never buy CNN,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox would never be interested in buying CNN, Fox Executive Chair Lachlan Murdoch said on Wednesday at a conference organized by the news website Business Insider in New York. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to block AT&T;’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), the parent of CNN, because of antitrust concerns about the merged company owning too much content and distribution. Before the suit, Justice Department staff had recommended AT&T; sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit, which includes CNN, to win antitrust approval, sources have told Reuters. Earlier this month, Reuters first reported that Rupert Murdoch, who shares the title of executive chair of Fox, telephoned AT&T; CEO Randall Stephenson twice to discuss CNN during the past six months. “We wouldn’t be allowed to buy CNN and we would never be interested in buying CNN,” Lachlan Murdoch, Rupert’s oldest son, said at the Business Insider conference. Fox owns Fox News and while there is no law against a company owning two cable networks, a deal could raise antitrust concerns. Stephenson has said he has no intention of selling CNN to gain approval of the acquisition of Time Warner. Lachlan Murdoch declined to comment on reports that Fox has been approached by a number of suitors, including Walt Disney Co, for a sizeable piece of its business, adding that he feels strongly about the company’s standing as a standalone company. He did acknowledge the challenges facing media companies today, noting as the pace of cable subscribers declines in the United States increased, international revenue and having a direct to consumer offering is increasingly important.

475,FOX,Breakingviews - The Force could be with Disney-Fox deal," NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Force could be with a Walt Disney deal for Twenty-First Century Fox. The Magic Kingdom is getting close to buying parts of Rupert Murdoch’s $60 billion empire, according to news reports. Disney would add to its clout with global outlets and cable content. The Murdoch family, meanwhile, may fancy shares in a bigger group. A deal could help with succession problems at both companies, too.  The acquisition would include assets like Fox’s FX cable network, movie studios, and global properties such as Star India and its 39 percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky. All in, the enterprise value of the deal could be more than $60 billion, according to CNBC.  Add Fox’s net debt to its market value, and its current EV is around $76 billion. If the assets of interest to Disney are really worth nearly 80 percent of that, it serves to underscore how heavily discounted Fox stock is at present as compared with the value of its parts.  Disney boss Bob Iger would probably pay largely in stock. So could another mooted rival, Comcast, where Chief Executive Brian Roberts’ clan holds sway through super-voting shares. Getting tangled up in another family-controlled firm, though, might be less appealing to the Murdochs, who hold nearly 40 percent of the voting rights at Fox. Comcast’s cable business also adds antitrust risks that Disney doesn’t have.  The most intriguing aspect of matching Mickey Mouse with Fox relates to succession planning. Disney is searching for a replacement for Iger, who is due to retire in 2019. Meanwhile, the triumvirate at Fox – Rupert and one son, Lachlan, as co-chairmen and James, the other son, as CEO – is potentially fraught. James could land a senior position at Disney, according to the Financial Times, perhaps giving him a chance at succeeding Iger.  Whether James Murdoch would ultimately achieve that is another question. But it would leave a slimmed-down Fox and sister company News Corp to his father and brother. At a time of industry upheaval fueled by Netflix and the like, the Murdochs could even end up ensconced at three media companies.",12062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-the-force-could-be-with-disney-fox-deal-idUSKBN1E031E
476,FOX,Britain pushes back date for provisional findings on Sky-Fox deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s competition watchdog will give its initial verdict on Rupert Murdoch’s bid to buy Sky (SKYB.L) next month, later than expected, due to the vast number of responses it has received on the deal. Murdoch’s $15 billion bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own is being watched closely in the United States where Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is in the lead to acquire much of his Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) media empire, including Sky.  Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has been inundated with submissions from interested parties over the high profile takeover, said on Wednesday it would make its provisional findings public in January rather than the week of Dec. 18. “It is not unusual for us to update our timetables,” a spokeswoman said. “In this case, we have received a large body of evidence – including numerous face-to-face hearings and more than 12,000 submissions - so it is vital that we spend the time to reach an informed and considered provisional view.” The regulator is still due to give its final findings in March, 15 months after Murdoch’s Fox agreed in December 2016 to buy the European pay-TV group, reigniting a row over whether the media mogul has too much influence in Britain.  Murdoch failed in a 2011 attempt to buy Sky when a phone-hacking scandal at his News of the World forced him to drop a previous attempt.  Since then he has split his companies into two to separate the newspapers from the TV businesses. Fox said when it agreed the deal it did not foresee any regulatory difficulties but the government has taken a strong line against the takeover. The media minister, Karen Bradley, asked the regulator in September to examine whether Murdoch had a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards following concerns about the running of his U.S. Fox News network. Bradley also asked the regulator to scrutinize whether the deal would give him too much influence at the heart of the British media.

483,FOX,"Comcast drops bid for Fox assets, leaving Disney in pole position","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp said on Monday it had abandoned its bid for most of the assets of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, leaving Walt Disney Co as the sole suitor in pursuit of the $40 billion-plus deal. Sources told Reuters last week that Disney was in the lead to acquire the assets, which include Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, the Star network in India and stake in European pay-TV provider Sky PLC. The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, prefers a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney stock than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, one of the sources said.  Comcast, the biggest cable provider in the United States, said in a statement on Monday that its discussions with Fox had ended. “When a set of assets like Fox’s becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.” The assets in question would have expanded Comcast’s international footprint through ownership of Sky and Star. A source told Reuters in mid-November that Comcast had approached Fox about its interest, and talks were in early stages. Disney’s negotiations with Fox are continuing, and a deal could be reached as early as this month, sources close to the situation said on Monday. The persons asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Disney did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Fox representative declined to comment. Any potential deal will follow the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision last month to sue to block AT&T; Inc’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc. Comcast shares were up 1.5 percent in after-hours trading, while Disney shares were up 0.2 percent and Fox shares fell 1.3 percent.

484,FOX,Fitch Places Twenty-First Century Fox on Watch Negative following Disney Acquisition Announcement,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the 'BBB+' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) assigned to Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOX), and its wholly owned subsidiary 21st Century Fox America, Inc. on Rating Watch Negative following the announcement that The Walt Disney Company (Disney) will acquire certain of FOX's assets in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $69 billion. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. Approximately $20 billion of debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2017 is affected by Fitch's action. Fitch's actions are driven by the lack of clarity regarding how FOX's existing debt will be treated and where it will ultimately reside in Disney's capital structure. Prior to the acquisition, FOX will separate its news and broadcast businesses and certain sports networks and equity interests into a newly listed company to be spun off to existing shareholders (FOX SpinCo). Disney will then acquire FOX's remaining assets, including $6.3 billion of cash, television and film studios, regional sports networks, general entertainment cable networks, international assets including cable networks and FOX's 39% equity stake in Sky plc (Sky) as well as FOX's equity stake in Hulu, along with the full $20billion of outstanding FOX debt (collectively, FOX RemainCo). If The Walt Disney Company does not elect to guarantee or become a direct obligor of the FOX RemainCo debt, Fitch-calculated total leverage as of Sept. 30, 2017 for FOX RemainCo would increase to 4.3x from 2.7x based on estimated EBITDA of approximately $4.7 billion for FY2018 as provided by Disney (excluding synergies). Under this scenario, FOX RemainCo's total leverage would be well outside the range for Fitch's 'BBB+' category. While Fitch would assume FOX RemainCo would benefit from strong strategic and operational ties it acknowledges the weak legal ties. As such, Fitch's Parent Subsidiary Linkage criteria allows for a subsidiary's IDR to be notched below the parent, typically within a range of three notches. FOX expects to continue efforts to close its previously announced $15 billion, all-cash transaction for the remaining 61% equity stake of Sky it does not own. The transaction continues to be subject to receipt of shareholder and regulatory approval and FOX expects it to close by June 30, 2018. If both FOX's acquisition of Sky and Disney's acquisition of FOX RemainCo closes, Fitch lacks clarity as to where the Sky transaction debt will ultimately reside in Disney's capital structure. Fitch estimates Sky acquisition debt will approximate $22 billion in aggregate including $12.1 billion of existing Sky debt and $10 billion of acquisition-related debt. If FOX RemainCo only assumes Sky's existing debt, Fitch estimates total leverage would decrease to 4.0x, based on Fitch's FY2018 estimate for Sky EBITDA of $2.9 billion. However, if FOX RemainCo were to assume the full amount, Fitch estimates total leverage would increase to 5.6x. Fitch notes that in any case it expects FOX RemainCo leverage to decline due to its expectation that Disney will refinance FOX RemainCo debt over time with debt issuance at the parent, along with continued EBITDA growth. Following the acquisition, FOX RemainCo will include the Twentieth Century Fox film and television studios, FX Networks, Fox Sports Regional Networks, Fox Networks Group International, Star India, and equity interests in National Geographic Partners, Hulu, Sky, Tata Sky and Endemol Shine Group. FOX SpinCo will comprise Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Sports, Fox Television Stations Group, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes and Big Ten Network along with its equity investment in Roku and its Los Angeles studio lot. The spin-off transaction will be taxable to FOX RemainCo, but not to its shareholders. To fund this liability, FOX SpinCo will pay an $8.5 billion cash dividend to FOX RemainCo prior to the spin, which Fitch expects will be funded with debt issuance. If FOX RemainCo's final tax liability is less than $8.5 billion, up to $2 billion of the reduced amountwill be returned to FOX SpinCo. As result of the step-up in FOX SpinCo's tax basis matching the amount of the spin-off's final corporate tax, FOX SpinCo will generate 15 years of cash tax savings. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Business Profile:  FOX's businesses consist of a leading portfolio of cable networks, television and movie studios, a national television network, and local television broadcast assets each of which have the scale characteristics to operate at high margins. Fitch believes these businesses provide solid growth prospects and the ability to generate meaningful FCF levels, and balanced against the risks inherent in the company's operating profile, place the company solidly within Fitch's parameters for the 'BBB+' rating. Sky Acquisition: On Dec. 15, 2016, FOX announced it was acquiring the 60.9% of Sky plc it does not own for $14.8 billion, funded with cash on hand and approximately $10 billion of debt. On Sept. 20, 2017, the UK Competition and Markets Authority referred the deal for a six-month review on public interest grounds and recently delayed releasing its preliminary findings until mid-January 2018. Because the deal will not close by Dec. 31, 2017, FOX will be required to pay a $135 million special dividend due to Sky's independent shareholders as required under the acquisition's terms. Investments Upside: FOX's equity investments include the 39.1% interest in Sky, 50% interest in Endemol Shine Group, a 30% interest in Hulu, LLC and several smaller investments in other media platforms. Fitch believes these investments allow FOX to be at the forefront of providing content to over-the-top (OTT) and emerging distribution platforms and capturing audiences in a fragmented television viewing ecosystem. While the investments do not provide meaningful contributions to earnings, they could be a source of liquidity. Consistent Financial Policy: If the Disney transaction does not occur and FOX is successful in acquiring the remainder of Sky, Fitch expects the company will use FCF generation along with its cash balances to repay debt. Management was very clear that it remains committed to its investment-grade ratings and expects to rapidly deleverage through EBITDA growth and FCF generation. Fitch expects FOX will curtail share repurchases and use its FCF generation and cash balances to return leverage to within the company's leverage target of 2.5x-3.0x within 24 months of closing. Credible Strategy to Address Threats: Fitch continues to believe FOX is well positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience fragmentation. The ratings incorporate earnings volatility from the Filmed Entertainment segment, given the hit-driven nature of the movie industry. Rating Concerns: Exposure to cyclical advertising revenues within local television and Fox Network ad sales, as well as the company's capacity to adapt to ever-changing media consumption patterns and technology platforms, highlight rating concerns. Fitch notes advertising revenues remained approximately 28% of revenues as of the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2017. DERIVATION SUMMARY The ratings reflect the company's strong collection of cable and regional sports networks, leading television and film studios, national television network, robust sports programming rights and local television broadcast. FOX is less reliant on advertising relative to its peers; ad revenues contributed 28% to revenues as of LTM ended Sept. 30, 2017. Additionally, if the company is successful in acquiring the remainder of Sky's ownership, the added product line and geographic diversification further reduce FOX's reliance on the volatile ad market. The company's businesses provide the ability to generate meaningful levels of FCF, leading to sustained investment in growth initiatives. Through this, FOX remains well positioned to address an increasingly fragmented market with the emergence of alternative distribution platforms. The ratings also incorporate expected earnings volatility generated by the company's Filmed Entertainment segment, given the general hit-driven nature of the movie industry. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions (for FOX stand-alone) within the agency's rating case for the issuer include: --Revenue growth within the company's cable network programming business reflects the company's ability to secure affiliate fee rate increases. Fitch anticipates low-double-digit affiliate fee growth. --The company's investment in original programming and acquisition of sports rights supports affiliate fee growth. --From a margin perspective, the base case reflects the company's investment in original programming and costs associated with acquired programming. The ability to grow higher affiliate fee revenues at a similar pace to programming costs contributes to stable margins at the cable network programming segment. --Fitch assumes typical volatility within the Filmed Entertainment business. The Television segment benefits from a stable economy and growing retransmission consent revenues while incorporating a typical political advertising revenue cycle. Fitch assumes a slightly weaker television advertising environment as digital media continues to take share. Fitch expects political advertising to contribute to positive growth during 2018. --The Sky acquisition closes in the first half of 2019 under existing terms and conditions. --FOX uses its FCF and cash on hand to repay debt, returning leverage to below 3x during 2020. --Fitch assumes FOX curtails its share buyback activity to free up more cash for debt repayment. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Actions --Fitch does not anticipate a rating upgrade given the acquisition discussions with Disney and the uncertain outcome surrounding the treatment of existing debt. --Fitch also does not anticipate a rating upgrade if the Disney discussions are unsuccessful given FOX's focus on acquiring the 60.9% of Sky it does not own. --Positive rating action would likely coincide with FOX adopting a more conservative financial policy, highlighted by a gross leverage target of 2x or lower. Meanwhile, FOX will need to demonstrate that its operating profile can sustain itself amid ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption patterns and evolving technology platforms. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Actions --Negative rating actions would be considered if Fitch determines that the organizational structure following Disney's acquisition of FOX RemainCo is disadvantageous to legacy FOX bondholders. Fitch would also need to consider Disney's financial policy regarding refinancing FOX RemainCo debt going forward. --Negative rating actions would be considered if FOX does not reduce total leverage to below 3x within 18-24 months after the closing of the Sky acquisition. --A material change in the terms of the acquisition prior to closing as a result of regulatory or shareholder requirements. --A material shift in financial policy including, but not limited to, the company adopting a more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition activity that drives leverage beyond 3x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan while exhausting excess cash balances. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes that FOX's liquidity position and financial flexibility are strong for the current rating given the strength of its businesses and expected FCF generation. The company's liquidity position is supported by an existing cash balance totaling $6.9 billion as of Sept. 30, 2017 (approximately $1 billion held by foreign subsidiaries as of Sept. 30, 2017), full borrowing capacity on its $1.4 billion revolver, which expires May 2020, and access to various film co-financing alternatives. The company generated approximately $2.2 billion of Fitch-defined FCF for the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2017. FCF generation remains strong even as the company continues to invest in channel launches, original content and higher programming costs (including sports programming) across its portfolio of cable and television networks. Fitch expects these investments will remain among the company's key priorities over the rating horizon. If FOX completes the Sky acquisition, Fitch expects FOX will use its FCF generation and cash balances to further invest in its core businesses and growth initiatives while curtailing share repurchases until leverage is below 3x.

485,FOX,"Breakingviews - Disney deal widens Murdoch legacy, erases discount","NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Walt Disney is expanding its Magic Kingdom to include the Murdoch empire. It is paying $52.4 billion in stock to own a slimmed-down Twenty-First Century Fox, including the movie studio and a 39 percent stake in Sky. It’s a historic deal for media mogul Rupert Murdoch – and it should erase the discount afflicting his long-suffering shareholders. It is, as Murdoch put it, a “momentous” moment for the media conglomerate he spent decades building. He is more often the aggressor than the target, latterly alongside his sons, Lachlan and James. Controlling some 40 percent of Fox voting shares has allowed him to prowl for deals without much interference. However, that’s also why Fox has traded at a discount to its peers – roughly 30 percent, give or take, by various calculations over the years. Other assets that will go with Fox to the $160 billion Disney include regional sports networks, cable channel FX and Star India. The rest of the Murdoch vehicle’s properties, including Fox News, will be spun off into a new company before the sale to Disney is consummated. The numbers are complicated, but including the Sky stake and a 30 percent share of Hulu, Breakingviews calculates the assets going to Disney could be worth about $58 billion in enterprise value. It’s paying $66.1 billion including assumed debt, more than the entire Fox was worth, including net debt, in early November before deal talks were first reported. The new Fox spinoff, using similar calculations which draw on analysis by MoffetNathanson and Bernstein, should be worth around $31 billion in enterprise value – assuming Murdoch’s continuing role doesn’t perpetuate a discount there. Add the two and subtract total net debt of around $15 billion and the $8.5 billion Disney suggests will go out in taxes, and today’s Fox shareholders may end up with Disney and “New Fox” stock worth an estimated $74 billion. At some $40 a share, that would be a 60 percent uplift from the value of Fox stock early last month. Even with less generous assumptions, the likely outcome easily wipes out the Murdoch discount. Disney CEO Bob Iger, meanwhile, has found a way to extend his tenure again. He’ll now stay until 2021. Among other things, he is promising $2 billion of cost savings. Before that, the deal may face antitrust questions. And by the time he does quit, it’s possible James Murdoch will be a candidate to succeed him. Along with “New Fox” and the newspaper-heavy News Corp, that would be a new kind of Murdoch legacy.",12142017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-disney-deal-widens-murdoch-legacy-erases-discount-idUSKBN1E82JP

493,FOX,"Disney buying Fox film, TV units for $52 billion in digital push","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has struck a deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) for $52.4 billion in stock, giving the world’s largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). The deal brings to a close more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world’s most important global news and film conglomerates. The new, slimmed down Fox will focus on TV news and sport.  Early indications are that the deal will not face strong resistance from antitrust regulators as AT&T; Corp’s (T.N) bid to acquire Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) has done. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has attacked the AT&T; deal, spoke to Murdoch on Thursday and congratulated him on the deal, according to the White House. Shares of Fox, which have surged more than 30 percent since talk of the deal surfaced in early November, closed up 6.5 percent. Disney shares rose 2.7 percent, spurred on by the company’s plan to buy up to $20 billion of its own shares to offset dilution from the all-stock deal. Disney will also assume about $13.7 billion of Fox debt in the deal. Fox stockholders will receive 0.2745 Disney shares for each share held and will end up owning about a quarter of Disney.  Under the deal, expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Disney acquires 21st Century Fox’s film and television studios, its cable entertainment networks and international TV businesses.  That brings marquee franchises like “Avatar” and “The Simpsons” inside the Mouse House, on top of Iger’s previous purchases, including Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm. The deal also includes 22 of Fox’s regional sports networks that have the rights to televise live games of U.S. professional baseball, basketball and hockey teams as well as popular college and high school games.   Disney’s global footprint expands with the acquisition of Fox’s international satellite assets, including Star TV network in India and a stake in European pay-TV provider Sky Plc (SKYB.L) and sports rights in several countries.  The new pipeline of shows and movies will help Disney battle technology companies siphoning audiences away from traditional TV networks. Amazon is on track to spend at least $4.5 billion on video this year, according to analyst estimates, while Netflix plans to spend $8 billion on content next year. That is closing the gap on Disney, which spent $13.5 billion on content, half of that on sports, in the latest fiscal year, according to analysts. “The deal illustrates the huge strategic challenge traditional media companies face and how they need to reinvent their business models to compete with digital, online competitors such as Netflix, Google and Amazon,” said Nick Jones, partner and head of technology at Cavendish Corporate Finance. “(It) helps Disney dramatically reduce its reliance on traditional television, a business that has declined over the last two decades.” Immediately before the acquisition, Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly listed company that it will spin off to its shareholders. “This will be a growth company, centered on live news and sports brands and the strength of the Fox network,” 21st Century Fox Executive Chairman Murdoch told investors. He said Fox was not retreating, rather “pivoting at a pivotal moment.” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, 66, will extend his tenure through the end of 2021 to oversee the integration of the Fox businesses. He has already postponed his retirement from Disney three times, saying in March he was committed to leaving the company in July 2019.  If Iger sees out his new term, that would rule out a presidential bid in 2020, which had been the subject of some speculation. “This acquisition reflects a changing media landscape, increasingly defined by transforming technology and evolving consumer expectations,” Iger told investors on a conference call.   He said new technology would be necessary to meet the demands of viewers who want to access content anytime. Fox’s regional sports networks and cable network puts Disney in a better position to sell more shows directly to more consumers, he added. Disney has been struggling to bolster its TV business as cancellation of cable subscriptions is pressuring its biggest network, sports channel ESPN.  The company plans to launch its own streaming service in 2019, a calculated gamble that it can generate more profit in the long run from its own subscription service rather than renting out movies to services like Netflix. It is not clear who will head the new Fox. Iger said current Fox CEO James Murdoch, Rupert’s younger son, will help with the transition and that the two will discuss whether he will have a longer-term role at Disney.  Through Fox’s stake in the Hulu video streaming service, Disney will assume majority control of one of Netflix’s main competitors. Hulu is also partially owned by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). A majority of antitrust experts contacted by Reuters said the deal would likely win approval from U.S. antitrust authorities, although the U.S. Department of Justice may require asset sales or conditions, they said.  Fox said it remained committed to buying the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own and expects to win regulatory approval from Britain and to close the deal by the end of June, 2018. Britain’s Takeover Panel said Disney had informed the watchdog that should it only buy 39 percent of the company - if Murdoch fails to buy the rest of Sky - it did not think it should be forced to make a full bid for the company. The statement prompted Sky’s stock to fall by 1 percent. In Britain, any investor acquiring 30 percent of a listed company is automatically forced to make a bid for the rest of the stock. The Takeover Panel said it would seek the opinions of Sky’s independent directors before making a decision.

494,FOX,Family-friendly Disney to bring edgier Fox fare to streaming video,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is poised to add foul-mouthed superhero Deadpool and gory TV series “American Horror Story” to its portfolio, a novel move for the king of family-friendly entertainment into the adult-oriented programming consumers are devouring on streaming video. Disney’s deal to buy most of the film and TV businesses of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) will aid the efforts of Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger to transform the company from a traditional media operation dependent on pay TV distributors to one that streams shows and movies directly to consumers online.  With the Fox deal, “they have content for everyone,” Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said. “They have family-friendly content, but that does not need to be the only thing they do, because there is a broader audience looking for a broad type of content.” In acquiring the Fox assets, Disney will also gain majority control of Hulu, a live TV and on-demand video provider that competes with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), the dominant streaming service.  Disney plans to make Hulu the home for programming aimed at adults such as FX series, keeping it separate from a Disney-branded streaming service for families planned for 2019, Iger told reporters on a conference call.  “It’s an opportunity for us to take some of these brands that don’t necessarily share all of the Disney brand attributes and use them to grow Hulu,” Iger said. FX airs shows such as the bloody “American Horror Story” and the dark and often graphically violent drama “Fargo,” a type of programming more akin to series found on Netflix or Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) HBO.  Iger said Disney has shown itself able in the past to successfully integrate new kinds of programming into its mission. Disney previously acquired Pixar Animation Studios, superhero studio Marvel Entertainment and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm and has given them a large degree of autonomy. That experience “suggests that we will be able to integrate these brands into the company in a manner that does not in any way create negatives for us,” Iger said. In March 2016, after Fox’s “Deadpool” movie became a huge hit, Iger was asked at the company’s annual shareholder meeting if Disney would consider making similar R-rated films featuring its Marvel superheroes. Iger said Disney did not plan to. On Thursday, Iger pulled back from that position, saying that characters like Deadpool might provide a model for an edgier kind of Marvel movie. “We think there might be an opportunity for a Marvel R brand for something like Deadpool,” he said, “as long as we let the audience know what’s coming.” ",12152017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-walt-disney-culture/family-friendly-disney-to-bring-edgier-fox-fare-to-streaming-video-idUSKBN1E83BW

498,FOX,Fitch Maintains Sky on Rating Watch Positive,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) MOSCOW/LONDON, December 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings is maintaining Sky plc's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings of  'BBB-' remain on Rating Watch Positive (RWP) following the announcement that The Walt Disney Company (Disney; A/Stable) will acquire 21st Century Fox, Inc. (FOX; BBB+/RWN). Fitch placed Sky's ratings on RWP on 16 December 2016 following the announcement of FOX's intention to acquire full control of the UK-based direct-to-home broadcaster. Both transactions are subject to regulatory approval. Assuming either both or only FOX/Sky transactions go ahead Fitch will view Sky's ratings in the context of the broadcaster's ownership by a stronger ultimate parent whether it is Disney or FOX. We expect strong strategic and operational links with Sky's higher-rated parent as per Fitch parent-subsidiary (PSL) methodology. However, legal ties in terms of direct support for subsidiary debt are less certain as it is not yet clear how FOX or Disney intend to manage the capital structure of the group. Subject to successful transactions and more clarity on how a parent plans to fund its subsidiary in the medium term, the ratings of Sky might be notched higher from its standalone profile for parental support. Fitch expects to resolve the RWP once the two transactions are finalised. If the transactions do not proceed, Fitch presently expects to affirm Sky's ratings at 'BBB-' given the company's underlying business and financial risk profile. Fitch views Sky as uniquely positioned as the UK's leading pay-TV platform, having established the UK as the most developed pay-TV market in Europe. Sky enjoys a strong business risk profile that is complemented by its wider telecoms capabilities, including a strong broadband position and nascent mobile business. Constraining factors are high leverage, a competitive UK communications market, near-term cash flow pressures and exposure to content rights inflation. KEY RATING DRIVERS Disney to Acquire FOX.  Fitch has placed the 'BBB+' IDR of FOX on Rating Watch Negative following the announcement that Disney will acquire certain of FOX's assets in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately USD69 billion. Fitch's actions are driven by the lack of clarity regarding how FOX's existing debt will be treated and where it will ultimately reside in Disney's capital structure. While Fitch would assume FOX would benefit from strong strategic and operational ties it acknowledges the weak legal ties between FOX and Disney. As such, Fitch's Parent Subsidiary Linkage criteria allows for a subsidiary's IDR to be notched below the parent, typically within a range of three notches. FOX expects to continue efforts to close its previously announced USD15 billion, all-cash transaction for the remaining 61% equity stake of Sky it does not own. A positive rating action for Sky is possible if either both or only FOX/Sky transaction succeed, reflecting potentially positive implications of ownership by a stronger ultimate parent. If the FOX/Sky deal are cancelled Sky's ratings should be affirmed at 'BBB-' providing the company's standalone operating and financial profile do not change materially. Sustained Operating Performance: Sky's businesses continue to perform well. Despite the maturity and competitiveness of its core TV/communications markets, the UK and Ireland delivered 5% constant-currency growth in 1Q FY18 (financial year end June), levels that comfortably outpace incumbent telecom revenue. Growth in these markets is slowing although Sky reports continued success in adding subscribers and maintaining other operating metrics. The pace of additions is nonetheless slowing and churn rates have ticked up, albeit remaining at best-in-class levels. The less-developed continental European businesses are growing at a healthy pace. Leverage Stabilising but High: Sky's leverage is high for the company's standalone rating. Sky ended FY17 with funds from operations (FFO) lease-adjusted net leverage of 3.1x compared with our downgrade threshold of 3.2x. Our rating case envisages a metric of 3.3x in FY18, breaching the downgrade guideline. The metric will continue to be affected by near-term cash flow and margin pressures resulting from content rights inflation that is compounded historically by the non-cash movements in debt driven by sterling's depreciation following the EU referendum. Deleveraging beyond 2018 is forecasted given an expected recovery in operational cash flows although foreign-exchange risk remains. Competitive UK Communications Market: Fitch views the UK, by far Sky's largest individual market, a particularly competitive market. In fixed line and TV both the incumbent BT Group plc (BBB+/Stable) and cable operator Virgin Media Inc. (BB-/Stable) have developed strong product offerings and market positions. BT's entrance to pay-TV in 2012, with an emphasis on exclusive sports content, has changed the nature of the sector, while a four-player network-based mobile market makes competition intense and convergence potentially more important to the UK consumer. Against this backdrop, Sky has established a strong commercial proposition with strengths across all main service platforms. DERIVATION SUMMARY Sky's broader peer group includes telcos such as BT Group plc, Royal KPN N.V. (BBB/Stable) and TDC A/S (BBB-/Stable), sub-investment grade cable operators such as Virgin Media Inc. and Telenet Group Holding N.V (BB-/Stable), and media conglomerate Vivendi SA (BBB/Stable). Sky's business model is nonetheless quite idiosyncratic given the company's position as the founder of pay-TV in the UK, a premium content-led business model and attendant exposure to content rights inflation. We regard Sky as strongly positioned in the UK pay-TV market and that management understands the need to provide a complete communications offering in this market given its expansion into telecoms services. Its revenue growth remains stronger than most of the telcos', but margins face pressure from content rights inflation and its business model and cash flow potentially face greater challenges than the telcos and cable operators. This drives a standalone rating profile at the lower end of the investment-grade range. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's Key Assumptions within Our Rating Case for the Issuer include: - Low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth; about 4.5% in 2018, falling to about 3.5% through 2021; - Adjusted EBITDA margin of 16%-17% in 2018-2021, with sports content rights suppressing margins in FY18 (Bundesliga costs) and FY20 (English Premier League costs); - Margins strengthening above 17% in FY21 given cost savings and scale economies in Germany and Italy; - Group capex to remain at about 7% of sales; and - Approximate GBP400 million dividend payment in FY18 (including a special dividend of GBP171 million), increasing to in excess of GBP600 million beyond. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating sensitivities for Sky's ratings on a standalone basis are as follows: Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Expectations of FFO net leverage remaining consistently below 2.7x (including transponder costs). -Free cash flow (FCF) margin consistently in high single digits (FY17: 2.7%). -Evidence of the resilience of the company's operating environment and core pay-TV business. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Expectations of FFO net leverage remaining consistently above 3.2x (including transponder costs). -Expectations of FCF margin remaining consistently below 4%. -Material deterioration in Sky's operating environment and key performance indicators; including the impact of content rights inflation, material weakening in reported churn, average revenue per user or evidence that over-the-top TV is becoming a more significant threat to its traditional pay-TV business. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: At end-June 2017, Sky reported cash and cash equivalent of GBP2.5 billion and access to an undrawn GBP1 billion revolving credit facility due 2021. Sky has sufficient cash to cover the next three years' worth of debt maturities with their revolving credit facility extending this period further.

499,FOX,CEOs go M&A; hunting as booming markets unleash dealmaking spirits,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions had another strong year in 2017, reaching their third highest annual level since the 2008 financial crisis, as CEOs were emboldened by buoyant markets to pursue transformative deals, even when their targets resisted. Companies negotiated large deals this year even before they had certainty that U.S. tax reforms advocated by President Donald Trump’s Republican party would become law, as economic growth around the world, including in Europe, accelerated. Setting 2017 apart was the willingness of potential acquirers to approach their targets unsolicited. In some instances, as with chipmaker Broadcom Ltd’s $103 billion cash-and-stock bid to take over peer Qualcomm Inc, the target companies refused to engage in talks. “In cases where companies have been sold, close to 80 percent of them were initiated by the buyer approaching the seller as opposed to companies who decided to sell,” said Michael Carr, global co-head of mergers & acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “Some of this is driven by buyers who believe they will not face competition, which encourages them to aggressively pressure their targets confidentially with the implied threat that they will go public,” Carr added. Unsolicited takeover approaches helped push global M&A; to $3.54 trillion in 2017, roughly in line with last year’s $3.59 trillion, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data. The peak M&A; year since 2008 was 2015, when M&A; totaled $4.22 trillion. The dealmaking environment has been favorable in the last three years due to the availability of cheap debt financing and high CEO confidence. Geopolitical turmoil, including a potential confrontation over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and faltering negotiations to form a coalition government in Germany, failed to dampen M&A; spirits. “Geopolitical uncertainty has had relatively little impact on our deals pipeline this year,” said Cyrus Kapadia, vice chairman of investment banking at Lazard Ltd. “Boards are supportive of deal-making where there is clear strategic rationale, and even in Britain, where Brexit is causing some uncertainty, companies are still pursuing large-scale deals to enhance organic growth,” he added. EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC M&A; UP A 16 percent year-on-year drop in M&A; in the United States to $1.4 trillion was offset on a global basis by a 16 percent rise in M&A; in Europe to $856 billion and an 11 percent rise in Asia-Pacific M&A; to $912 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Among this year’s biggest acquisitions were U.S. drugstore chain operator CVS Health Corp’s $69 billion agreement to buy health insurer Aetna Inc; Walt Disney Co’s $52 billion deal to buy film and television businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc; and aerospace supplier United Technologies Corp’s $30 billion agreement to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc. Many of these deals had stock as part of the purchase price, with acquirers emboldened to use their own shares as currency given their high stock market valuations, as opposed to offering just cash. “We are seeing a stock component becoming a bigger portion of the offers being made, perhaps because the deals are bigger and transformative, and acquirers are looking to offer targets additional upside in these transactions,” said Stephen Arcano, an M&A; partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.  Private equity-backed M&A; activity totaled $322.6 billion globally in 2017, a 27 percent increase compared to last year, as more buyout firms sought to put money they have raised from their investors to work. Dealmakers say the prospect of the U.S. tax overhaul has so far had little influence on deal negotiations. “If you are an acquirer, you are likely modeling a deal  where the synergies and the incremental value of combining is what is driving your purchase price and your premium, not an assumption on the underlying tax rate,” said Chris Ventresca, global M&A; co-head at ‎JPMorgan Chase & Co. “If you are considering selling the entire company, as long as the buyer is willing to pay your price, you take the certainty of crystallizing a premium now with some ability to participate in tax reform upside via buyer stock,” Ventresca added. Companies may decide to allocate more of their cash to M&A; in 2018 following the implementation of the U.S. tax changes, however. “U.S. companies with lots of cash trapped overseas can now more easily put capital to work in the M&A; market, while Europeans may try to take advantage of favorable tax policies to do more deals in the United States,” said Dietrich Becker, co-head of European advisory at Perella Weinberg Partners LP.

509,FOX,UK regulator puts hurdle in path of Murdoch's $15.7 billion Sky deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s $15.7 billion takeover of European broadcaster Sky  should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent the media tycoon from influencing the network’s news output, Britain’s competition regulator said. The initial ruling complicates a separate plan by Walt Disney Co to buy the majority of Murdoch’s assets, including Sky. Disney had hoped Murdoch would own 100 percent of the company by the time it completed its takeover.  Shares in Sky rose on Tuesday as investors said concerns about Murdoch’s influence could still be overcome, for example by spinning off Sky News, Britain’s first 24-hour news channel. The regulator also indicated it would not object to Disney owning Sky eventually. “It’s good news today that the regulator isn’t going to block the deal outright,” said Michael Wegener, managing director at Case Equity Partners, a Sky shareholder. “The Murdochs will come up with remedies that work around Sky News.” Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in December 2016, re-igniting a political row in Britain about the influence he wields through his ownership of newspapers the Sun and the Times and his stake in Sky, the biggest pay-TV platform. Critics of the deal argue that Murdoch could hold sway over the editorial output of Sky’s loss making news channel. Sky warned that were the deal to be rejected because of Sky News, it could shut the channel itself.  The British government, which will take the final decision on the deal, asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to judge if Murdoch had too much influence in Britain and would uphold broadcasting standards.  “We have provisionally found that if the Fox/Sky merger went ahead as proposed, it would be against the public interest,” the CMA’s Anne Lambert said on Tuesday.  “It would result in the Murdoch family having too much control over news providers in the UK, and too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.” Murdoch’s news outlets are watched, read or heard by nearly a third of Britons and have a combined share of public news consumption that is significantly greater than all other news providers, except the BBC and commercial TV news provider ITN. Possible ways to resolve concerns about Murdoch’s influence in Britain could include spinning off or divesting Sky News, or insulating Sky News from Fox’s influence, the CMA said. A third option is to block the deal outright.  On the issue of broadcasting standards, the regulator cleared Murdoch, saying that recent allegations of sexual harassment at his Fox News network in the United States did not call into question his commitment to standards in Britain. An objection on broadcasting standards would have likely sounded the death knell for the deal. “Broadcasting standards is not an issue anymore,” said one hedge fund manager that holds Sky shares. “That’s a pretty big positive.” The manager cautioned however that it was unclear how motivated the Murdochs were to secure the deal, seeing as they have already agreed to offload it to Disney. Shares in Sky, which also has major operations in Germany and Italy, rose 2.3 percent to 10.26 pounds by 1335 GMT. Fox agreed to pay 10.75 pounds in cash for each Sky share in December 2016. “The initial reaction would be to suggest there is an easy fix in that Sky News could be disposed of, either by sale or closure or some other form,” said broker Liberum, which downgraded Sky to hold from buy. “However, the language of the CMA in its provisional findings suggests they are more minded to blocking the deal as a way of addressing concerns.” Fox has already offered up remedies to protect the independence of Sky News including the establishment of a Sky News Editorial Board.  But the CMA said media regulator Ofcom had received complaints suggesting that previous attempts by Murdoch to guarantee the editorial independence of the Times newspapers in Britain and the Dow Jones company had proved ineffective.  The CMA said a “comprehensive solution” to the questions posed by the deal would be simply to block it. Fox said it was disappointed about the provisional judgment, although it welcomed the decision that it had a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. It said it would continue to engage with the CMA ahead of the final report in May, and it anticipated approval of the deal by June 30. Britain’s newly appointed Media Secretary Matt Hancock said on Tuesday he would decide on the deal by 14 June, 30 working days after he is due to receive the CMA’s final report.    An eventual rejection would be a personal blow to Murdoch, who has spent decades building ties with prime ministers and politicians in Britain. His son James oversaw Sky’s growth as chief executive and currently chairs the broadcaster. The 86-year-old tycoon sought to buy Sky in 2010, but a phone-hacking scandal at his News of the World tabloid forced him to drop the bid. Since then he has split his companies into two to separate the newspapers from the TV businesses. If Fox is eventually blocked, Disney could buy the rest of Sky itself at a later date, and it would face fewer regulatory objections than the Murdochs. “On the face of it, these concerns would fall away if the Disney/Fox transaction went ahead as announced,” the CMA said. Disney will buy Fox’s 39 percent Sky stake in its $52.4 billion purchase of Fox assets, a deal that faces its own lengthy regulatory process in the United States.  That level of ownership would normally require an owner to bid for the whole company, but Disney has asked regulators to allow it leeway to decide whether to bid or not.

513,FOX,Breakingviews - Rupert Murdoch’s next foe: Sky hedge fund holdouts,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rupert Murdoch’s next foe in his battle for Sky may be hedge funds. The tycoon’s Twenty-First Century Fox should be able to win regulatory approval to buy the 61 percent it doesn’t own of the pay-TV group. But holdouts could attempt to sink the deal unless they get a higher price. The UK competition authority on Tuesday said Fox’s 11.7 billion pound bid would give Murdoch too much influence over British news. But it also said that its concerns would fall away if Walt Disney’s $52 billion offer for Fox assets, including Sky, goes ahead. In the meantime, Fox can ring-fence Sky’s news operation to protect its independence. Sky investors may be less forgiving. Eight hedge funds have acquired shares or derivatives equivalent to 13 percent of Sky’s capital since mid-December, according to a Breakingviews analysis. Fox needs support from three-quarters of independent shareholders for the deal to go through. Assuming 80 percent turn up to vote, a rebellion equivalent to just 12 percent of Sky’s capital could sink it. Investors could justify a higher price than the 10.75 pounds on offer. Sky’s core business selling TV subscriptions in Britain has grown steadily since Fox’s December 2016 offer; group revenue was 5 percent higher year-on-year in the six months to the end of 2017, the company said on Thursday. Then there are the imminent auctions for England’s Premier League soccer. Sky currently pays almost 1.4 billion pounds a year to broadcast the games.  But rival bidder BT is cash-strapped, and the two have struck a deal to show each other’s TV channels, suggesting bidding may be less fierce than previously.  Investec reckons even a 20 percent step up in rights costs could add 39 pence to Sky’s share price. Lastly, there’s Disney. Even if Murdoch were to refuse to increase his offer, Disney may want to buy out the minorities itself later. Opposing Fox may backfire. Murdoch could reduce the acceptance threshold to just 50 percent by switching to a takeover offer rather than a scheme of arrangement. And the Magic Kingdom’s motives aren’t clear; it might be happy to leave minority shareholders outstanding for years.  Sky’s share price is languishing about 4 percent below the offer price, which augurs poorly for a bump. But with the regulatory fog clearing, there’s scope for another twist in the takeover drama.",1252018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-rupert-murdochs-next-foe-sky-hedge-fund-holdouts-idUSKBN1FE1GW
514,FOX,UPDATE 2-TV dramas boost Sky as its own takeover saga drags on,"* First-half earnings rise 10 pct * Customer base up 365,000 to 22.9 mln * Working with regulator on Fox takeover process (Adds CEO comments, shares, reaction) By Paul Sandle LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Hit shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Riviera” helped Sky deliver a 10 percent rise in first-half earnings, underscoring the appeal of the European pay-TV group to the U.S. media companies trying to buy it. Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox was provisionally blocked this week from buying the shares in Sky it does not already own, although there are options that would allow the $15.7 billion deal to do through. Sky, whose customer base rose by 365,000 in the half to 22.9 million, could then be sold to Disney if a separate sale of Murdoch’s TV and film assets receives the green light. The British broadcaster reported revenue of 6.7 billion pounds ($9.6 billion) for the six months to the end of December, up 5 percent year-on-year and in line with the first quarter, while core earnings rose to 1.1 billion pounds. “This performance reflects the investment choices we have made in recent years, allowing us to more than offset the pressure on consumer spending across Europe, as more customers continue to choose Sky for more of their services,” Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said. Shares in Sky, which are trading at the highest levels since Fox announced its 10.75 pound-a-share bid in Dec 2016, were up 1 percent at 10.34 pounds at 0948 GMT. The satellite-company, which operates in Italy, Germany and Austria as well as Britain and Ireland, said it would pay an interim dividend of 13.06 pence a share, on top of a special dividend of 10 pence, which UBS analysts said was a positive surprise. Darroch said the company’s investment in original programming, such as dramas “Riviera” and “Tin Star”, drove viewing figures for Sky’s own channels up 6 percent. “We have an exceptional line-up of acquired series, and when you add to that our own Sky Originals, it puts us in what I think is the strongest content position we’ve ever had,” he told reporters on Thursday. The results come two days after Britain’s competition regulatory ruled that Fox’s bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own was not in the public interest. Murdoch, who also owns newspapers in Britain, now has to come up with an arrangement that will prevent him from influencing the news agenda at Sky, for instance by spinning off its Sky News channel. Darroch said Sky, along with Fox, was focused on this media ownership hurdle after the competition regulator dismissed concerns about Murdoch’s commitment to broadcasting standards. “We are very much focused in the process with the (regulator) CMA,” he told reporters. “We have (media) plurality as the final issue to work though,(...) and we’ll see where that takes us.” He would not comment on the company’s thinking about Sky News, saying any messages about the 24-hour service would be given directly to staff. “We have got a day job to do,” he said. “And I think you can see from results and the plan we are laying out for 2018 we are not being distracted from any of that.” Before the government gives its final decision on the Fox deal in June, Sky faces the next auction for English Premier League rights, the cornerstone of its offer to soccer fans. Some of the pressure on Sky to pay huge sums to retain the biggest packages of games has been eased by a deal it struck with its biggest rival BT to supply channels on each other’s platform. Darroch said he wouldn’t give a running commentary on the auction, adding Sky’s bid strategy was commercially sensitive.

Comcast’s deliberations indicate that it believes it still has a chance to clinch a deal with Fox, even though it previous bid last year for more than $60 billion was rejected over concerns that regulators worried about media consolidation could thwart it, the sources said. Comcast may decide not to make any new offer, the sources said. Its decision will be informed by how Fox justifies the deal with Disney in a regulatory filing to its shareholders sometime before they are asked to vote on the deal this summer, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Comcast, Disney and Fox gave no immediate comment. Comcast might be prepared to offer protections to Fox such as agreeing to remove certain assets from the deal that prove controversial in Washington, D.C., including regional sports channels, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on Comcast’s deliberations. It was is possible that instead of re-engaging in pursuit of all of Fox assets, Comcast could zero in on something in particular, such as European pay TV giant Sky, the Wall Street Journal report said, citing anonymous sources. The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, preferred a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, sources told Reuters in December.

523,FOX,Time Warner a good investment despite merger uncertainty -investor,"(Reuters) - Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) stock is an attractive investment despite uncertainty surrounding its pending deal with AT&T; Inc (T.N), according to a prominent investor.  “It’s hard to find a more compelling opportunity than Time Warner,” said Samantha Greenberg, chief investment officer at New York-based hedge fund Margate Capital at a Reuters event on Tuesday.  The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block AT&T;’s $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner, struck more than 15 months ago, on the grounds it would raise prices for consumers and rivals. A trial to decide the matter begins in March.  Time Warner shares are a good investment regardless of the outcome, Greenberg told attendees of Reuters Breakingviews’ “No Safe Spaces for Big Media” panel. “They have been in deal hell and their stock has massively underperformed the S&P; 500,” Greenberg said. Time Warner trades at about 11.5 times earnings projected for this year, she said, a touch over the sector average. Even if AT&T; does not win its case against the Justice Department, other buyers will likely emerge, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Greenberg said.  The panel focused on consolidation in the media sector as programmers and distributors try to prevent viewers cancelling their cable and satellite subscriptions to watch shows on online services provided by Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which are spending billions of dollars on content.  “Linear TV is in trouble,” said James Murray, a partner at PJT partners, a New York-based investment bank. Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) announced a $52.4 billion deal to buy the majority of Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O)’s assets. But Comcast Corp, which had also bid for the Fox assets, is considering making a new bid for them, sources have told Reuters.  Just this month, Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) and CBS Corp (CBS.N) announced they were  exploring a merger. Panelists said they expect technology companies such as Apple and Amazon to acquire movie or TV studios this year. “Technology companies will go for the small pure plays,” said Julius Genachowski, partner and managing director at The Carlyle Group.

In a potential new hurdle for the proposed $15.7 billion takeover of Sky, Avaaz said that a High Court judge had allowed the challenge to broadcast regulator Ofcom’s ruling last June that a Fox-controlled Sky would be a ‘fit and proper’ owner of broadcast licenses in Britain. Avaaz said the case would be heard before the end of June, potentially complicating an agreement to sell Sky to Fox and then on to Disney (DIS.N) if a separate sale of tycoon Rupert Murdoch’s TV and film assets receives the green light. The regulator said allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News in the U.S. were extremely serious and disturbing, but had found no clear evidence to suggest senior executives at Fox were aware of the misconduct. “We will defend our ‘fit and proper’ assessment, which was independent, expert and based on the evidence,” an Ofcom spokesman said in a statement.  The deal already faces other obstacles. Last month Britain’s competition regulator said that it should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent Murdoch, who owns the Times and the Sun newspapers, from influencing Sky’s news output.

527,FOX,Attention turns to bid price after Sky's soccer winner,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sky (SKYB.L) has tightened its grip on English Premier League football rights at a lower price than it currently pays, fuelling speculation that Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) could now be forced to pay more to buy the broadcaster. The positive result for Rupert Murdoch’s European pay-TV company could strengthen the hand of shareholders who want Fox to raise its offer to buy the 61 percent of the group it does not already own.  Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) also had an interest in the outcome because if its $52 billion (37.52 billion pounds) deal to buy Fox assets is cleared, it will end up owning either all of Sky, or the 39 percent stake that Fox currently holds. Shares in Sky rose 3.5 percent to a two-year high of 10.98 pounds, exceeding the 10.75 pounds per share that Fox agreed to pay for the group in December 2016. Analysts at Jefferies said Sky, which has used Premier League football to help build its pay TV business over more than two decades, had emerged as the winner in the auction for domestic TV rights from 2019-22. “Retaining the bulk of English Premier League rights was key for Sky to maintain its premium position, but to do so and secure a lower outlay is a bonus,” they said. Some investors had already argued that Sky should fetch a higher price after Disney agreed to buy Fox’s film, television studios and other assets at a price which they said represented a higher multiple than Fox agreed for Sky. Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who has a stake in Sky, has long argued that Fox should be stumping up more. “It looks like they’re not going to get it at the original price,” he told Reuters on Wednesday. “Our view is they won’t get it for less than 13.40 pounds.” Of the seven packages of matches on offer for three seasons from August 2019, Sky won four for a total outlay of 3.58 billion pounds, while BT will pay 885 million pounds for its one package. Sky said it was spending 16 percent less per game than under its present three-year deal.  Two of the seven packages, both of which involved rights to simultaneous screening of a block of matches, remained unsold at this point, indicating that the Premier League had not met its  reserve price. Analyst Polo Tang at UBS, who forecast no rise in the price Sky would pay when most were expecting a 20-30 percent jump, had said a good result would suggest scope for a higher Fox offer. He said in theory the outcome would lead to a 500 million pound boost to the consensus for 1.7 billion pounds earnings in the 2020 financial year. “We believe Sky will likely use some of this headroom to invest more in original programming,” he said. “(But) materially higher levels of profitability at Sky could lead to shareholders seeking a higher offer price from Fox.” Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) is also considering an intervention in the Disney deal and making a competing offer for the Fox assets, Reuters reported. Such a move could further stoke expectations that Sky is worth more than Fox has agreed to pay. “There’s a lot going on now,” Odey said of Comcast’s potential interest. Like Odey, hedge fund Polygon has questioned the price that Fox has offered and said in December that it thought Sky was worth more than 13 pounds a share. Elliott, the U.S. hedge fund best-known for its activist campaigns at companies, including forcing bidders to pay more during takeovers, has also been stakebuilding in Sky recently and lifted its interest to 1.99 percent last week.  Elliott has not given a reason for its Sky investment and declined to comment on Wednesday.

533,FOX,"Fox, Disney and now Comcast - a timeline of Sky takeover proposals","LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable giant Comcast (CMCSA.O) has offered to buy Sky (SKYB.L) for $31 billion in a surprise move, posing another hurdle to tycoon Rupert Murdoch’s attempts to buy the broadcaster.  Murdoch’s Fox (FOXA.O) has agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own, but the deal has become bogged down in regulatory investigations. In the meantime, Fox has agreed to sell assets to Disney in a follow-on deal, including Sky.  Murdoch helped to launch Sky in 1990 before his holding was cut to around 40 percent during its flotation in 1994. He sought to buy the company back eight years ago but failed during a high-profile media and political scandal. Here is a timeline:     June, 2010  Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp proposes to pay $12 billion to take full control of British satellite broadcaster BSkyB.  Mid 2010 to mid 2011 A phone-hacking scandal erupts at Murdoch-owned tabloid News of the World, culminating in the closure of the paper and the appearance of Murdoch before parliament, which he describes as the “most humble day of my life”.     July, 2011 News Corp withdraws its bid for the 61 percent of BSkyB it does not own, in the face of widespread hostility. June, 2012 Murdoch announces a plan to split his company in two, dividing his assets into a publishing business called News Corp and an entertainment-focused firm, 21st Century Fox, which holds the stake in BSkyB.  July, 2014 BSkyB agrees to pay $9 billion to buy Murdoch’s pay-TV companies in Germany and Italy, taking its hunt for growth into Europe by creating a media powerhouse with 20 million customers and renaming itself as Sky. December, 2016 Fox strikes a $14.6 billion deal to buy Sky to unite Murdoch’s media empire across two continents and help it take on rivals like Netflix (NFLX.O) in the battle for viewers. March, 2017      The British government asks broadcast regulator Ofcom to decide if the deal is in the public interest. June 29, 2017 Britain says it intends to subject the deal to a further, in-depth investigation after finding it risks giving the media mogul too much power over the news agenda. September 12, 2017 Britain’s culture secretary throws the deal into doubt when she asks regulators to consider whether Fox would uphold standards, having not previously raised such concerns. September 14, 2017 Britain confirms it will refer Fox’s bid for Sky to a lengthy regulatory investigation. November, 2017  Comcast CEO Brian Roberts takes a London taxi to a Sky store, and is impressed with the products and how people talk about Sky - cab driver included.

535,FOX,Walt Disney makes 2 billion euros investment in Disneyland Paris,"PARIS (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Company (DIS.N) announced a 2 billion euro ($2.5 billion) investment to expand its French theme park Disneyland Paris after taking full control of the business last year. Chief Executive Bob Iger announced the spending plan after meeting President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, saying it reflected the U.S. media group’s positive view on France and Europe more widely. “This investment...is the direct result of the growing confidence that we have in the economy of Europe and in France in particular,” Iger said in a video posted on the French Presidency’s twitter account. However, Iger suffered a blow on Tuesday when U.S. cable giant Comcast (CMCSA.O) offered to buy European broadcaster Sky for $31 billion, potentially derailing Disney’s own bid for assets owned by Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O).    The Disneyland development will include three new areas based on Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man and the Hulk, Disney’s animated film Frozen and Star Wars, and will be rolled out in phases, starting in 2021. There will also be new attractions and live entertainment experiences. “The expansion plan is one of the most ambitious development projects at Disneyland Paris since its opening in 1992 and underscores the company’s commitment to the long-term success of the resort as Disney’s brand beacon in Europe,” Walt Disney said in a statement. Macron, a former investment banker pushing through social and economic reforms, said Iger’s financial commitment reflected renewed investor belief in France.  “Your confidence shows that France is back,” Macron said in his own tweet. Disneyland Paris is Europe’s most visited theme park. It sits on a 2,230-hectare site about 32 kilometres (20 miles ) east of Paris, though only half of site has been developed so far, according to the company’s 2016 annual report. With more than 320 million visitors passing through its turnstiles since 1992, the park accounts for 6.2 percent of France’s tourism income and has been a boon for local employment, employing some 16,000 staff.  Even so, Euro Disney faced deep financial troubles after making overly optimistic projections on visitor numbers and taking on too much debt.  Walt Disney took control of the ailing company in June 2017 and de-listed its shares.  Its new investment drive comes amid a rebound in French tourism after the industry was weakened by a series of Islamist militant attacks in Paris, Nice and other cities.  Euro Disney racked up a net loss of 858 million euros in 2016 as visitor numbers fell 10 percent to 13.4 million. However, 2017 marked the French capital’s best year for tourism in at least a decade. Disneyland Paris comprises two theme parks - the fairytale-themed Disneyland Park and the Walt Disney Studios Park. Its seven hotels have some 5,800 bedrooms, two convention centers and a golf course.

537,FOX,Hedge funds expect counter bid for Sky after Comcast offer,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two hedge funds that have criticized Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) takeover of Britain’s Sky (SKYB.L) have said Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) rival $31 billion offer for the broadcaster is likely to trigger a higher counter-bid for the company.     Comcast on Tuesday offered 12.50 pounds-a-share for the pay-television operator, seeking to disrupt a deal struck in December 2016 by Rupert Murdoch’s Fox (FOXA.O) to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for 10.75 pounds-a-share.      The situation is further complicated by a $52 billion deal agreed in December 2017 by Walt Disney Co to buy Fox assets, including its 39 percent Sky stake. Disney has previously said it expects the sale of Sky to Fox to complete before it acquires the Fox assets, meaning it would assume full ownership of the British company.  Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who has long argued that Fox’s takeover proposal is too cheap, told Reuters the bid from Comcast, the biggest U.S. cable operator, was “fantastic” and that a counter offer was now likely.

538,FOX,UPDATE 1-Hedge funds expect counter bid for Sky after Comcast offer,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two hedge funds that have criticised Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) takeover of Britain’s Sky (SKYB.L) have said Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) rival $31 billion offer for the broadcaster is likely to trigger a higher counter-bid for the company. Comcast on Tuesday offered 12.50 pounds-a-share for the pay-television operator, seeking to disrupt a deal struck in December 2016 by Rupert Murdoch’s Fox (FOXA.O) to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for 10.75 pounds-a-share.      The situation is further complicated by a $52 billion (37.26 billion pounds) deal agreed in December 2017 by Walt Disney Co to buy Fox assets, including its 39 percent Sky stake. Disney has previously said it expects the sale of Sky to Fox to complete before it acquires the Fox assets, meaning it would assume full ownership of the British company.

543,FOX,Sky strikes deal to add Netflix to its European pay-TV bundles,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sky, the European pay-TV group at the center of a fierce takeover battle, said it would add online video service Netflix to a new TV bundle, bringing drama like “The Crown” to its sport and entertainment offer for the first time. Netflix’s mix of original drama and movies has proved popular globally, with subscriber numbers reaching nearly 118 million at the end of 2017, bringing new competition to traditional pay-TV cable and satellite providers. Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch said the tie-up would enable customers to access even more entertainment on its platform. “By placing Sky and Netflix content side by side, along with programs from the likes of HBO, Showtime, Fox and Disney, we are making the entertainment experience even easier and simpler for our customers,” he said. Netflix will launch on Sky’s premium Sky Q product in Britain and Ireland this year, and in Germany, Austria and Italy thereafter, Sky said. Sky, which Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox and Comcast Corp are battling over, struck a deal with British rival BT last year to carry each other’s sports channels, enabling viewers to see more Premier League soccer on one platform.

547,FOX,Four senior UK politicians urge regulator to block Murdoch-Sky deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Four high-profile British lawmakers have called for Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) to be blocked from buying Sky (SKYB.L), saying the mogul will be able to influence its news output despite promises to the contrary.  Murdoch is locked in a battle with U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) to buy Europe’s biggest pay-TV group, with the Australian-born tycoon hampered by his ownership of other assets in Britain including two leading national newspapers.  In order to gain regulatory approval Fox has offered to guarantee the independence of the Sky News operation by funding it for 10 years and creating a fully independent board to oversee it, a move that led analysts and competition lawyers to say the deal would likely be cleared.  But four lawmakers who have previously criticized Murdoch’s influence in Britain, including the former leader of the opposition Labour party Ed Miliband, said in a letter to the regulator that the offers did not go far enough. They noted that the chief executive of Sky would still appoint the head of Sky News. “This is a significant statement because other statements made have tended to imply that the Editorial board will somehow be in charge of the process, not the Sky CEO,” they said.   Fox agreed a deal to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in December 2016 but it has been repeatedly delayed by the government and regulators. It is likely to learn whether it can take over Sky in the middle of June.  Fox has said it does not agree with the regulator’s objections but has offered to protect Sky News to help secure approval. Fox has agreed to sell a string of assets on to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), including Sky.      Comcast has offered 12.50 pounds per share or 22.1 billion pounds for Sky compared with Fox’s offer of 10.75 pounds per share, but it has not yet made a formal bid and is trying to secure its own regulatory approval.   The four lawmakers are Miliband; Vince Cable, the leader of the small opposition Liberal Democrats party; Ken Clarke, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Conservative Party and Charles Falconer, a former Labour justice minister.  “We would urge the panel to come to a clear finding in favor of prohibition, consistent with its powerful provisional findings,” the letter said.

550,FOX,Britain shrugs off Brexit to enjoy boom in dealmaking,"LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - British companies have been swept up in a global boom in dealmaking that has seen the amount of M&A; involving UK firms hit its highest level since 2007. Britain’s M&A; market has remained buoyant despite the country’s looming exit from the European Union a year from now, a prospect which has cast uncertainty over British companies’ access to the single market. Rather than deter businesses from striking deals, however, it has prompted them to prepare for Brexit by acquiring rivals to build scale. The availability of cheap debt, high equity valuations that are allowing companies to use their stock to pay for acquisitions, and economic growth are all behind the surge in M&A;, bankers said. The value of M&A; volumes involving British businesses rose by 56.5 percent to $164.3 billion during the first quarter, the most since the $166.3 billion recorded in the same period 11 years ago, Thomson Reuters data show. Including plans by Anglo-Dutch Unilever and RELX to abandon their dual listing structures, total deal levels hit $280.8 billion in the first three months of 2018 in the UK, according to the data. It means that Britain remained the second biggest country for deals behind the U.S. Globally, dealmaking surged 67 percent to almost $1.2 trillion, the data show. In Britain this week alone,  U.S. exchange operator CME Group agreed to buy British financial technology firm NEX for about 3.9 billion pounds ($5.5 billion) and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical said it was considering an approach for FTSE 100 drugmaker Shire, which has a market value of about 32 billion pounds. “This feels like it’s going to be a big year for M&A;,” said Alison Harding-Jones, the head of European, Middle East and Africa M&A; at Citigroup. “This is not just UK based and is driven by a perfect storm of all the ingredients you need for deals.” British companies are bulking up in preparation for the post-Brexit era. Dwayne Lysaght, the head of UK M&A; at JP Morgan Cazenove, said there is “a bit of a Brexit squeeze which is encouraging a focus on domestic consolidation.” “British companies are acknowledging the need to be bigger to compete in a more open, global market place,” he added. Domestic deals totalled $43.3 billion in value during the first quarter, up from $24.9 billion a year earlier, the Thomson Reuters data show. They include events and exhibitions business Informa’s 3.9 billion-pound deal to acquire rival UBM and the sale of Standard Life Aberdeen’s insurance business to Phoenix for 3.2 billion pounds. The biggest is Melrose Industries 8 billion-pound hostile offer for aerospace and automotive parts supplier GKN , which was Britain’s largest hostile bid since Kraft swooped on Cadbury in 2009. Melrose will find out later on Thursday whether enough GKN investors have accepted its offer. Stripping out Unilever and RELX, outbound M&A; volumes were$27.2 billion, down from $42.3 billion in 2017, while inbound deals rose to $77.9 billion pounds, from $17.5 billion a year earlier, according to the data. The biggest bid by an overseas acquirer for a British group was Comcast’s potential 22.1 billion-pound proposal for Sky, an attempt by the U.S. giant to gatecrash the takeover the broadcaster agreed with its 39 percent shareholder Twenty-First Century Fox late in 2016. Both Fox’s pending bid for Sky and Melrose’s pursuit of GKN have drawn considerable scrutiny from British lawmakers. The former has raised concerns about Rupert Murdoch’s influence over the UK media landscape, while the latter has sparked fears Melrose will break-up GKN, which is a mainstay of Britain’s engineering sector. Indeed, under Theresa May, who became prime minister in July 2016, the British government has adopted a more interventionist stance towards M&A; by foreign companies. In October, it proposed new rules that would give lawmakers more say over takeovers of firms involved in the more sensitive technology and defence sectors. Even so, that stance has not deterred overseas businesses from attempting to buy British firms, said Dominic Morris, the head of UK M&A; at law firm Allen & Overy. “Yes, you could argue the government’s being more activist to some degree and people have to be mindful of that,” he said. “But do I think it’s right up there at the top of (acquirer’s) agenda? I’m not sure it is.” More worrying for the M&A; bankers and lawyers would be if the current boom in deals proved to be the top of the cycle, as it was 11 years ago, and activity begins to falter. “It feels very similar to 2007,” said Morris. “I would say if we’re not at the top of the market, we must be pretty close to it.” ($1 = 0.7112 pounds) (Reporting by Ben Martin Editing by Keith Weir)",3292018,http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-ma/britain-shrugs-off-brexit-to-enjoy-boom-in-dealmaking-idUSL8N1RB3CR

552,FOX,Exclusive: CBS plans all-stock bid for Viacom below current valuation - sources,"(Reuters) - CBS Corp (CBS.N) plans to make an all-stock offer for Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) that values the U.S. media company below its current market valuation, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, indicating that tough negotiations lie ahead.  It is unusual for deal negotiations to start with the acquirer valuing its target at a discount. The fact that CBS’s first bid for Viacom infers such a valuation reflects how CBS views its position in the U.S. media landscape as superior to Viacom’s. As part of its initial offer to be submitted in the next few days, CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves will propose to stay at the helm for at least two years if the U.S. media company’s bid to merge with peer Viacom is accepted, according to the sources. That offer is contingent on Viacom accepting all other aspects of CBS’s bid, the sources added.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. CBS and Viacom declined to comment. Viacom’s shares were down 3 percent at around $29.62 in after-hours trading, while CBS shares were little changed. CBS and Viacom have market capitalizations of $19.4 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively.  CBS and Viacom set up special committees to explore the merger in February, a move to reunite the companies split by controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone more than a decade ago. The two companies explored a merger in 2016 instigated by the Redstone family, but those talks ended unsuccessfully, due to concerns by CBS about price and governance issues.   Since then, Viacom CEO Bob Bakish has taken a number of steps to boost the company’s performance, including improving relations with cable and satellite companies, causing some analysts to expect CBS to acquire Viacom at a premium. Many of Viacom and CBS’s competitors are merging as scale becomes increasingly important in the media landscape, with more customers cancelling pricey cable contracts, and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) spending billions of dollars on making shows and movies.

553,FOX,Murdoch's Fox could sell Sky News to Disney to appease UK regulator,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch has stepped up the pressure on Britain to approve his $14.5 billion bid for Sky (SKYB.L) by offering to sell or legally separate Sky News, seeking to allay concerns about the 87-year-old mogul’s political influence. Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) said on Tuesday Sky News could be sold on to U.S. rival Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) or become a legally separate business within the Sky group.   Fox agreed in December 2016 to buy the 61 percent of European pay-TV group Sky it does not already own, but the deal has been repeatedly delayed by the UK government and regulators. Fox had already promised that Sky’s 24-hour news service would remain independent under the ultimate control of Murdoch, but critics, including some high-profile politicians, remain adamantly opposed due to Murdoch’s record of influence through owning the Sun and the Times newspapers.  The delay enabled U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp CMCSA.0 to gatecrash the deal in February by saying it would offer 12.50 pounds a share to buy Sky, compared with Fox’s 10.75 pounds - although it has not yet made a formal bid. As the Sky deal remained in regulatory limbo, Fox separately agreed to sell a string of assets, including its 39 percent stake in Sky, to Disney, potentially taking Murdoch out of the Sky equation. Fox said on Tuesday its new concessions went beyond the steps that Britain’s media regulator Ofcom said would mitigate concerns about Murdoch’s influence.  The company, however, needs to persuade another regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and the government.  “We have worked diligently with the CMA throughout its extensive review,” it said. “In fact, we believe that the enhanced firewall remedies we proposed to safeguard the editorial independence of Sky News addressed comprehensively and constructively the CMA’s provisional concerns.” Fox said it could legally separate Sky News within the wider Sky group, so it would operate independently with guaranteed funding for 15 years. Alternatively, it said Disney had expressed an interest in acquiring the 24-hour news channel, whether or not Disney’s proposed acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox went ahead. Fox senior vice president Gerson Zweifach said the solutions  addressed all concerns about the transaction.  “We look forward to concluding this acquisition - finally - in a timely and expeditious manner,” he said. Sky shares were up 0.9 percent at 13.09 pounds at 0906 GMT, above both the agreed offer from Fox and the proposed bid by Comcast. Analysts at Liberum said Fox’s latest concessions should be enough to secure approval. They also said that two factors pointed to Fox coming back with a revised bid to match Comcast. First, Fox must have received approval from Disney to offer the concession, they said, and second, Sky said its independent directors remained focused on maximizing value for shareholders. Separate news on Tuesday that Sky Italia had settled its long-running fight with Mediaset in the Italian pay-TV market also made Sky more valuable, they added. A group of high-profile British lawmakers, including former Labour party leader Ed Miliband, called last month for Murdoch to be blocked from buying Sky, despite the promises Fox had already made to ensure the independence of Sky News. The four said the promises did not go far enough, given Murdoch’s record of influence. The group could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. Fox said on Tuesday a group of politicians was seeking to influence the CMA, adding they were making “a number of unsupported and fanciful assertions”.

The CBS offer, which was communicated verbally last Friday, valued Viacom at below its market value of around $12.5 billion, according to the sources. The back-and-forth between the companies indicates that tough negotiations lie ahead. Viacom has not yet decided on the exact share exchange ratio it will ask for, but is expected to seek more than 0.62 CBS share for every Viacom share, one of the sources said. Viacom’s counterproposal is expected by Thursday, another of the sources added. Viacom will argue that potential cost synergies of more than $1 billion mean that it should command a premium in a deal, according to the sources.  National Amusements Inc, the controlling shareholder of CBS and Viacom, wants Viacom CEO Robert Bakish to be No. 2 in the combined company, the sources said. But CBS CEO Les Moonves, who has offered to run the combined company, wants CBS Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello as No. 2, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. CBS and Viacom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CNBC first reported that Viacom had dismissed CBS’s offer. Viacom shares were up nearly 1 percent at $29.69, while CBS shares were up 0.5 percent at $53.14. CBS and Viacom set up special committees to explore the merger in February, a move to reunite the companies split by controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone more than a decade ago.

556,FOX,Hedge fund Paulson & Co takes stake in Viacom amid turnaround,"April 11 (Reuters) - Paulson & Co, the hedge fund firm led by billionaire investor John Paulson, has taken a stake in Viacom Inc as the U.S. media company has started to turn around its business amid a challenging landscape, Paulson told Reuters in an interview. Over the past few months, Paulson has bought 3.7 million nonvoting shares of Viacom as the company, which for years has suffered from declining advertising and viewership, has begun to show results of its turnaround plan under Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish, Paulson said on Tuesday. “We are very impressed with the turnaround,” Paulson said. “It is starting to look attractive.” Paulson said he began buying shares of Viacom before the company began re-exploring a merger with CBS Corp, which he does not own. CBS and Viacom, both of which are controlled by Shari and Sumner Redstone, began exploring a merger in February. The two companies are negotiating the price of a deal, which is expected to be all-stock, and who will run the combined company, sources have told Reuters. A merger of CBS, which owns its broadcast network and premier channel Showtime, with Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures and such networks as Comedy Central and MTV, makes sense because it would give the company scale at a time when many media companies are merging, Paulson said. Walt Disney Co, for example, is in the middle of acquiring a number of 21st Century Fox’s assets. Paulson said he has been impressed not only with the fact that, under Bakish, Viacom has renewed carriage deals with traditional cable companies like Charter Communications Inc , but that Bakish is focused on gaining subscribers through deals with online streaming services and mobile deals. “We are just at the beginning of this,” he said. Viacom recently announced a deal with Telefónica SA in Latin America to give its mobile subscribers access to its networks and shows. Paulson also noted that Paramount Pictures, under its new head, Jim Gianopulos, has started to show a stronger slate. The studio’s horror movie “The Quiet Place,” which opened last weekend, topped box-office sales, bringing in $50 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada. Paulson estimates that a combined CBS/Viacom could realize more than $1 billion in synergies, adding that he hopes the two companies can agree on a management structure that includes CBS CEO Leslie Moonves and Bakish. “When it’s time for Les to retire, Bob is more than capable,” he said.

559,FOX,"Disney must offer to buy all of Sky, Britain's takeover regulator rules","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s takeover regulator said Walt Disney (DIS.N) must offer to buy all of Sky if it acquires Twenty-First Century Fox’s 39 percent stake and if Rupert Murdoch’s Fox is prevented from purchasing all of the European pay-TV company itself. Fox (FOXA.O) agreed an offer to buy all of Sky (SKYB.L) 17 months ago but is still waiting regulatory approval, while Disney has agreed to buy Fox assets, including its stake in Sky, in a separate deal subject to its own regulatory clearance. The ruling means that if Fox’s bid to buy Sky is blocked by the government in June because of Murdoch’s media influence, Disney will have to step in to make the same offer to shareholders if and when it becomes the owner of Fox’s assets. Disney had said it should not be required to make a bid for the whole of Sky in line with Fox’s existing offer if it bought the Fox assets, but Britain’s Takeover Panel ruled on Thursday that it must match Fox’s 10.75 pounds-a-share price. Analysts had said Disney wanted a special dispensation to give it more flexibility on whether or when it would bid for the rest of Sky if it only bought the 39 percent stake from Fox.  The Takeover Panel, however, said it considered that  securing control of Sky might reasonably be considered to be a significant purpose of Disney’s acquiring control of Fox, and it must make an offer within 28 days of buying the Fox assets. The Panel’s ruling will not stand if Fox has acquired 100 percent of Sky by the time Disney buys the Fox assets, or if Comcast Corp or any other third party has acquired a stake of more than 50 percent in Sky.  U.S. cable company Comcast (CMCSA.O) said on Feb. 27 that it was considering making an offer for Sky. Sky said it noted the Takeover Panel’s ruling, and it advised shareholders to take no further action at this time. Twenty-First Century Fox said that under the ruling, any mandatory offer by Disney would only be required after Disney’s acquisition of Fox is completed, which Fox currently expects to occur after completion of Fox’s offer for Sky.  “21CF (Fox) remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky announced on 15th December 2016,” it said.

564,FOX,UPDATE 1-Sky reports strong quarter before bid battle steps up,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sky (SKYB.L), the pay-TV group at the center of a takeover battle between Fox, Disney and Comcast, reported a strong third quarter on Thursday, underlining its appeal to rival U.S. entertainment groups who want to expand in Europe. Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said the British company was “well placed for the future” regardless of which company emerged as its ultimate owner.   Sky added 38,000 customers, taking its customer base to nearly 23 million homes.  Core earnings for the nine months to end-March were up 10 percent to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) on like-for-like revenue up 5 percent to 10.1 billion pounds. The latest battle to buy Sky started in December 2016, when Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O), the owner of 39 percent of the company, agreed to buy the rest. Since then, the deal has been stuck in regulatory purgatory,  a tortuous process due to end in June. But if Fox receives clearance it is unlikely to end up as the long-term owner of Sky. Murdoch agreed to sell most of Fox to Disney (DIS.N) for $52.4 billion in December, including its stake in Sky.  Fox spurned a higher offer from U.S. cable giant Comcast (CMCSA.O) over concerns about regulatory risk and its stock value, a filing showed on Wednesday. After losing that battle, Comcast said it was considering making a 12.50 pounds a share offer for Sky, valuing the group at $31 billion, and trumping the 10.75 pounds offer agreed by Fox.  Darroch said on Thursday there had been some interaction between Sky and Comcast in terms of the regulatory process.  “They haven’t yet come forward with a full offer, as and when they do that, if they do, then we will obviously come back and talk a bit more in detail then,” he told reporters. Fox/Disney and Comcast want to buy Sky to scale up against online groups Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Darroch said Sky was continuing to improve its own products and services to ensure it provided the content entertainment its customers wanted. It will launch streaming service Spotify (SPOT.N) on its flagship Sky Q platform next week, and will offer Netflix (NFLX.O) in a Sky package in Britain before the end of the year, he said. “Customers can look forward to an even broader choice of entertainment through our pioneering new partnerships with Netflix and Spotify, together with our new Premier League deal which secures the UK rights until 2022,” he said. Sky shares were trading at 13.05 pounds at 1036 GMT, down 0.3 percent.

566,FOX,Breakingviews - Comcast is best leaving Fox to the Mouse,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast boss Brian Roberts already made a bid for parts of Twenty-First Century Fox, and failed. Now he has left the door ajar for another lurch. It would be better to walk away. Roberts seems to be in the mood for mergers. He confirmed on Wednesday morning a $31 billion offer for European pay-TV company Sky. That’s 16 percent higher than an offer already made by Fox, which is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it doesn’t already own in order to then sell the whole thing to Walt Disney. Second, Roberts promised during an earnings call not to use the company’s sagging shares as an acquisition currency – but pointed to the strength of Comcast’s balance sheet, in a strong signal that he is open to further deals funded by cash. Pledging not to use stock for deals is fair enough. Shareholders often don’t like dilution. But the risk is that Roberts might be tempted to reprise his bid for some other bits of Fox, which Disney has agreed to buy for $66.1 billion including debt. Comcast tried that once before, but was knocked back by Fox’s chairman and presiding shareholder, Rupert Murdoch. Here’s why Roberts ought to refrain. The Fox assets might make $3.8 billion in operating profit in 2018, taking Bernstein EBITDA divisional estimates and assuming operating profit is split among the Fox businesses in the same proportions. Assume Comcast can drive out $1.5 billion of savings, less than Disney’s estimate of $2 billion, and the total hits $5.3 billion. Tax that, and for a deal valued at $66 billion, Comcast’s return on investment would be about 6 percent. And that’s even if Comcast matches, rather than tries to best, Disney’s offer. True, Roberts would be saving Disney from itself. The Magic Kingdom’s return on investment, even with higher cost savings, is still below 8 percent. But that’s no consolation to Comcast shareholders, who would be left with a value-destroying deal. Fox originally swatted away Comcast’s offer because of regulatory risk, and it’s unlikely Murdoch would have wanted to hold shares in a company Roberts controls. Comcast should thank him – because trying again, even in cash, would simply be a bad idea.",4252018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-fox-breakingviews/breakingviews-comcast-is-best-leaving-fox-to-the-mouse-idUSKBN1HW2RR
567,FOX,Breakingviews - Sky upside depends on Disney-Fox irrationality,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Deals rarely look as good on paper as they do in a chief executive’s head. Comcast’s $31 billion offer for UK satellite broadcaster Sky just about passes financial muster. Investors expecting a higher bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox, with backing from Walt Disney boss Bob Iger, are betting on the triumph of sentiment over spreadsheet. The cable giant run by Brian Roberts on Wednesday firmed up its offer of 12.50 pounds per Sky share, beating Murdoch’s December 2016 bid by 16 percent. The move endangers the mogul’s plan to sell Fox – including Sky – to Disney for $52.4 billion in stock. It also dashes any hopes that Iger and Murdoch could persuade Roberts to back away by offering him an alternative asset, like U.S. streaming service Hulu. Assuming British regulators clear both bids, it’s a straightforward battle on price. Comcast has the stronger hand. On Wednesday the $155 billion company said it had identified $300 million of annual pre-tax cost savings and a further $200 million of gains from combining Sky’s TV shows and movies with Comcast’s NBCUniversal library. Generously add those to consensus estimates for Sky’s operating profit in 2020, tax the lot at 18 percent, and the return on invested capital is almost 7 percent. That’s just about in line with cable groups’ cost of capital, according to New York University estimates. It’s hard to see how Murdoch and Iger could justify going higher. The House of Mouse has less overlap with Sky’s core business as a distributor of video entertainment. Second, Comcast has greater firepower: its leverage is low for a cable group and its EBITDA this year will be greater than Disney and Fox combined, according to Eikon estimates. Besides, Comcast’s dual-class stock means Roberts does not have to fret about shareholders blocking his plans. Iger might conclude that Sky is crucial to his European expansion. Murdoch, meanwhile, will be reluctant to part with the company he spent decades building, and might want to hang on to Fox’s 39 percent stake in case the wider Disney tie-up collapses. Nevertheless, investors who pushed Sky shares up 4 percent to 13.57 pounds on Wednesday are wagering on Disney and Fox disregarding financial sense.",4252018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-sky-upside-depends-on-disney-fox-irrationality-idUSKBN1HW248
568,FOX,UPDATE 1-Comcast tops Wall St forecasts for first quarter,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday as the communications company cut expenses and added high-speed internet customers, offsetting a drop in cable TV subscriptions. The biggest U.S. cable provider said in its results that it added 379,000 customers for the internet service overall in the first quarter, while its main TV business was helped by NBCUniversal’s broadcast of the Olympics and the Super Bowl. Separately, Comcast formalized a 22 billion pound ($31 billion) bid for U.K.- based pay-TV group Sky PLC (SKYB.L), challenging a lower but already-agreed takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O). Shares of the Philadelphia-based company were down 1 pct at $33 in premarket trade. Comcast revenue rose 10.7 percent to $22.79 billion, just ahead of an analyst consensus of $22.74 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Total capital expenditures were $1.97 billion during the quarter, down 5 percent from last year. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were 62 cents per share, beating analyst estimates of 59 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters data. It was not immediately clear if the figures were fully comparable. Comcast lost 96,000 video subscribers in the quarter ended March 31, compared with an addition of 42,000 customers last year. Analysts from MoffettNathanson, UBS and Macquarie had expected losses of about 75,000 video customers. Overall it added 273,000 customers as the high-speed internet additions beat estimates of about 365,000. Average earnings per customer relationship ticked up 0.9 percent to $152.83.

The S&P; energy index rose 1.9 percent after oil prices hit their highest levels in 3-1/2 years as investors worried that Trump’s decision would increase risks of conflict in the Middle East and curtail oil supplies in a tight market. The energy sector has risen more than 10 percent so far in the quarter, far outperforming the other major S&P; indexes. However, a 3.5 percent drop in Walmart limited gains on the Dow after the retailer took a majority stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart for about $16 billion. “Oil is probably not helping, it’s a kind of a potential inflation indicator,” said Mark Travis, chief executive officer of Intrepid Capital Funds in Jacksonville Beach, Florida. “The underlying challenge for the financial markets is not so much whether Trump does or doesn’t do anything. It is the impact of the rates rising facing an expensive capital markets.” The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to a two-week high and above the key 3 percent level on expectations of higher interest rates.

577,FOX,US STOCKS-Wall St rises as oil rally boosts energy stocks,"* U.S. 10-year bond yield tops 3 pct * Walmart drops on $16 bln deal for India’s Flipkart * Oil continues ascent, at highest levels since 2014 * Indexes up: Dow 0.23 pct, S&P; 0.37 pct, Nasdaq 0.27 pct (Updates to open) By Sruthi Shankar May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, with shares of energy companies getting a boost from surging oil prices after President Donald Trump decided to pull the United States out of a nuclear deal with Iran. The S&P; energy index rose 2.2 percent as oil prices hit their highest levels since late 2014 after Trump announced the “highest level” of sanctions against the OPEC member. The energy index has risen more than 10 percent in the quarter, far outperforming the other major S&P; sectors. “While (energy sector) is providing near-term support for U.S. indexes, I wonder whether it will help in the longer-term, with the decision potentially increasing geopolitical risk,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA in London, wrote in a note. A Labor Department report on Wednesday showed U.S. producer prices rose less than expected in April, easing fears that inflation pressures were rapidly building up. The report follows a recent reading on personal consumption expenditure, the Federal Reserve’s favored metric, which hit the 2 percent inflation target. That had raised the expectations of higher interest rates, pushing the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield to a two-week high and above the key 3 percent level. At 9:52 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 56.90 points, or 0.23 percent, at 24,417.11, the S&P; 500 was up 9.80 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,681.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 19.38 points, or 0.27 percent, at 7,286.29. The technology sector’s 0.3 percent rise was the second biggest driver on the S&P; 500 index. Walmart dropped 3.6 percent after it acquired a controlling stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart for about $16 billion, the U.S. retailer’s biggest foreign investment. Walt Disney dipped 2 percent. The media company, which is in the process of buying film and TV assets from Twenty-First Century Fox, reported quarterly profit that topped Wall Street forecasts.

578,FOX,US STOCKS-Wall St set for higher open as oil rally boosts energy stocks,"* U.S. 10-year bond yield tops 3 pct * Walmart drops on $16 bln deal for India’s Flipkart * Oil continues ascent, at highest levels since 2014 * Futures up: Dow 0.42 pct, S&P; 0.34 pct, Nasdaq 0.22 pct (Adds comment, details, updates prices) By Sruthi Shankar May 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open higher on Wednesday, with shares of energy companies getting a boost from surging oil prices after President Donald Trump decided to pull the United States out of a nuclear deal with Iran. Oil rose more than 3 percent to 3-1/2 year highs after Trump announced the “highest level” of economic sanctions against the OPEC member, casting uncertainty over global oil supplies. Shares of oil majors Exxon and Chevron were up more than 1 percent in premarket trading. The S&P; energy index closed up 0.78 percent on Tuesday, as Wall Street was whipsawed by conflicting reports on Trump’s decision, ahead of the official announcement. “While (energy sector) is providing near-term support for U.S. indexes, I wonder whether it will help in the longer-term, with the decision potentially increasing geopolitical risk,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA in London, wrote in a note. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to a two-week high back above the key 3 percent level. Analysts said expectations for higher interest rates continued to drive bond yields higher, overshadowing any fallout from the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal for now. Investors are keeping a close watch on inflation, after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s favored gauge hit its 2 percent target. The latest Labor Department report showed U.S. producer prices rose less-than-expected in April, held down by a moderation in the cost of both goods and services. At 8:44 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 102 points, or 0.42 percent. S&P; 500 e-minis were up 9 points, or 0.34 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 14.75 points, or 0.22 percent. Walmart fell 4.9 percent after it acquired a controlling stake in Indian homegrown e-commerce firm Flipkart for about $16 billion, the U.S. retailer’s biggest foreign investment. Match Group rose 5.7 percent after the Tinder-owner beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly revenue and profit as it attracted more subscribers to its dating apps and websites. Walt Disney dipped 0.6 percent. The media company, which is in the process of buying film and TV assets from Twenty-First Century Fox, reported quarterly profit that topped Wall Street forecasts.
