2,LOW,RPT-COLUMN-Paying taxes your employer keeps-David Cay Johnston," The author is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.  (Repeating with link to graphic)   By David Cay Johnston   July 19 (Reuters) - Painful as it feels to have a lot of hard-earned income taken from your paycheck for taxes, a new Illinois law does something Americans may find surprising. It lets some employers pocket taxes for 10 years.   You read that right — in Illinois the state income taxes withheld from your paycheck may be kept by your employer under a law that took effect in May. Continental Corporation (CONG.DE), the big German tire maker; Motorola Mobility (MMI.N), the cell phone maker; and Navistar (NAV.N), the maker of diesel trucks for industry and the military, are in on the deal. State officials say a fourth company is negotiating a similar arrangement.   Chrysler and Mitsubishi arranged deals with the state in the depths of the Great Recession in 2009; Ford got one in 2007, since revised to let it keep half of its Illinois workers’ state income taxes.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   link.reuters.com/jaz62s  GRAPHIC: r.reuters.com/guc72s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   Instead of paying for police, teachers, roads and other state and local services that grease the wheels of commerce, Illinois workers at these companies will subsidize their employers with the state income taxes they pay.   The deal to let employers keep half or all of their workers’ state income taxes represents a dramatic expansion of a little-known trend in the law: diverting taxes from public purposes to private gain.   Throughout the United States, big box retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Lowe’s (LOW.N) and Cabela’s CAB.N, and in some cases entire shopping malls, often negotiate deals to keep sales taxes that customers pay at the cash register, using the money to finance construction of their stores. This gives them a huge advantage over retailers without such subsidies, while reducing revenue to local governments, which in turn creates pressure for higher taxes.   The pipeline industry, a collection of legal monopolies with rates that are regulated, gets to include the federal corporate income tax in the rates charged customers even though nearly all pipelines are exempt from the federal corporate income tax because they are organized as master limited partnerships. Evidence in one federal court case showed that collecting this tax, plus state income taxes, and then pocketing the taxes increased ultimate net after-tax profits by 75 percent.   The Illinois deal shows how competition between the states, and with other countries, helps big corporations wring subsidies from state governments even as the states are being forced to fire teachers and other public workers because of a weak economy that has cost jobs and tax revenue.   Why would the state let companies do this? Most big companies pay little or no state corporate income tax, because companies arrange to take expenses in higher tax states and profits in states with little or no corporate income tax. So the only way to finance incentives without the state writing a check is to let the companies pocket their workers’ state income tax.   The Illinois deal also shows how government, rather than the market, picks winners and losers. While America promotes the dream of a free market and competition, this sort of corporate socialism has been around since before the founding of the republic and has played a key role in the rise of many industries, including railroads, aircraft, as well as computer hardware and software.   Warren Ribley, director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, said “it’s a fair question” as to whether taxpayers should be subsidizing businesses. He said elected leaders and the public should debate the issue.   “In the meantime,” Ribley said, “I am out there competing every single day with states and countries across the entire globe and I have got to have the tools and I have to use the tools provided by the General Assembly,” as the Illinois legislature is formally known.   State Representative Jack Franks, a Democrat from the northern end of Illinois, said the deals “are fundamentally unfair” to taxpayers and other companies.   “Our current governor had the genius idea of giving to Motorola and Navistar and others, he said to retain their business here, yet he is allowing Navistar to fire up to 25 percent of their workforce and still get millions from the state” by holding onto the income taxes of employees.   The Illinois law lets companies retain all of the income taxes withheld from the paychecks of workers whose hiring expands the payroll and half of the taxes for existing workers whose jobs are retained.   For Continental the deal means $22 million over 10 years diverted to its coffers from the state income taxes withheld from worker paychecks to help pay for a $224 million expansion of its Mount Vernon tire plant in southern Illinois. The deal will retain 2,500 jobs and create 400 more rather than prompt the plant to move to Mexico, Brazil or another state.   The hourly tire workers, under a two-tier pay scale that means lower wages for new hires, make either $19.35 an hour or $16.31 an hour. For a year that is pay of just under $34,000 to $40,000.   Based on a 3 percent average Illinois state income tax rate for people in that income range, and assuming Continental’s 2,500 hourly workers remain at the higher wage rate and 400 new workers are hired at the lower wage rate, the annual diversion of their income taxes would be as much as $1.9 million of the average $2.2 million annual benefit from the deal. Taxes paid by supervisors and managers, and expected higher wages in future years, account for the other $300,000 per year or so for the next decade.   Navistar is getting the deal even though its application shows it plans to reduce its workforce of 3,100 to about 2,200.   Ribley said companies that got earlier deals in which they avoided the state corporate income tax and then failed to create or retain jobs as promised have actually paid back the benefits.   The three companies that got the deal are not named in the law enacted in May, but the language of Public Act 97-2 defines them by describing the industry, employment level and other specifics that show how the law was tailored to benefit just them.   Here’s a prediction: other states soon will also authorize diverting income taxes withheld from worker paychecks to their employers, if some have not done so already — unless, of course, voters speak up on behalf of competitive markets and against this sort of corporate socialism.

John Tilak and Allison Martell   TORONTO, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Rona Inc’s RON.TO quarterly profit dropped a steeper-than-expected 40 percent as Canadian consumers cut spending on its home improvement products, sending its shares down 5 percent.   The reluctance of homeowners to invest in big-ticket renovation projects, the lifeblood of Rona’s business, has plagued Canada’s No. 1 do-it-yourself chain.   Second-quarter sales at its established stores fell 9.6 percent, following a 12.6 percent decline in the first quarter.  “The results were ugly — in all capital letters and bold,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. “People are just not willing to spend.”   Second-quarter earnings fell to C$39.5 million ($39.9 million), or 28 Canadian cents a share, from C$66.3 million, or 51 Canadian cents, a year before.   Analysts on average were looking for earnings of 40 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue fell 2 percent to C$1.37 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of C$1.43 billion.   The company sees same-store sales staying little changed or falling up to 5 percent in the second half of the year. It sees earnings in the second half to be little changed from the year earlier.   Consumer spending on home improvement products has remained tepid, never fully returning though the country’s economic downturn eased over the past year. Rona’s more expensive discretionary products such as solariums and patios are seen as a low priority when budgets are tight.   “We faced very challenging conditions in the quarter, especially in April and May, when weather was not favorable for construction and renovation projects,” said Chief Executive Officer Robert Dutton on a conference call.   Dutton also said the company was hurt by consumers’ continuing prudent spending on renovation.   Yarbrough said weather was not the issue. Same-store sales have not grown on an annual basis since 2006, he said.   “The consumer spending environment is weak, but more so in home improvement.”   The company competes with Home Depot Inc (HD.N) (HD.N) and Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N). Both companies reported falling same-store sales in the first quarter of 2010 and are due to report second-quarter results next week.   Those companies do not break out their Canadian sales, however. Yarbrough said Rona may be facing a tougher environment north of the border.   “The industry overall is tough in Canada. Home Depot and Lowe’s are struggling as well in Canada,” Yarbrough said.   The stock, down 24 percent since the start of the year, fell 5 percent to C$10.20 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It hit a near-three-year low of C$10.03 earlier in the day.

6,LOW,Google deal boosts shares for third day,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rose for a third day on Monday as investors saw Google’s offer for phone maker Motorola Mobility as an excuse to jump back into the market after weeks of sharp selling.  Acquisition activity is often viewed as a sign major corporations sitting on big cash piles are willing to pay for shares even as economic growth remains sluggish.  Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc jumped 55.8 percent to $38.13 after Google offered $12.5 billion to buy the company, which would be Google’s biggest deal ever. Google shares ended down 1.2 percent at $557.23.  With Monday’s gains, the stomach-churning losses incurred last week have now been wiped out. Among big winners were banks, which have been a frequent target for selling. Bank of America Corp rose 7.9 percent to $7.76, making it the Dow’s biggest percentage gainer.  “The shining point throughout this whole debacle is that corporate America is actually doing quite well,” said King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. “It shows that they’re not yet ready to throw in the towel.”  Shares of other cell phone companies also rose, riding hopes of additional takeovers or the possibility of business shifting to Google’s competitors. Blackberry maker Research in Motion advanced 10.4 percent to $27.11 while Nokia jumped 17.4 percent to $6.29.  The S&P financial index rose 3.2 percent. Shares of Bank of America advanced after it said it plans to sell its credit card business in Canada to TD Bank Group.  Three days of market gains follow weeks of intense volatility and a sharp selloff that put the S&P 500 in negative territory for the year. After the rebound, the S&P is now down just 4.2 percent on the year.  “It’s causing people to rethink their view toward the market,” said Nick Kalivas, senior equity index analyst at MF Global in Chicago. “It’s causing people to think more about valuation than they have in recent days.”  The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 213.88 points, or 1.90 percent, to 11,482.90. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 25.68 points, or 2.18 percent, to 1,204.49. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 47.22 points, or 1.88 percent, to 2,555.20.  Trading volume slowed from last week to 8.14 billion on Monday, down from the daily average of approximately 16 billion shares traded last week.  About 10 stocks advanced for every declining stock on the New York Stock Exchange, while roughly four stocks rose for every declining stock on the Nasdaq.  A meeting on Tuesday by French and German political leaders was expected to result in initiatives needed to restore confidence in credit and other markets.  Shares of Lowes Cos Inc were up 0.9 percent at $19.68 after it reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its fiscal-year outlook.

7,LOW,NY factory index contracts for third month,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Manufacturing in the New York area contracted for the third straight month in August, data showed on Monday, tempering any lingering hopes for a rebound in the U.S. economy in the second half of the year.  Manufacturing led the U.S. recovery in the past couple of years, even though it represents only about 12 percent of overall national output, but in recent months growth in the sector has slowed sharply.  The New York Federal Reserve’s Empire State index showed the general business conditions index fell to minus 7.72 in August from minus 3.76 the month before. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of zero.  “This is consistent with the negative tone that has permeated throughout the markets. Clearly we are not starting the new round of manufacturing data on good footing,” said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets.  The deterioration in the survey of manufacturing plants in New York state, the nation’s third largest economy and the 14th biggest globally after Australia, bodes ill for the more widely followed Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index due out on Thursday. This in turn can be a harbinger for the larger national survey from the Institute for Supply Management at the beginning of September.  Separate data on Monday showed the housing sector remained weak with a gauge of homebuilder sentiment stuck at historic lows and as Lowe’s Cos Inc cut its fiscal-year outlook.  The Fed also said demand for consumer bank loans was largely flat over the past three months, while commercial and industrial lending saw some increased demand.  Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said risks of recession have risen over the last few months though he expected the economy could avoid an outright recession. [ID:nW1E7IR00Y].  Analysts said the New York report is cause for concern.  “It certainly set a negative tone for the national ISM release that has been teetering at that breakeven point,” said Lindsey Piegza, economist at FTN Financial in New York.  The ISM national factory activity index has dropped since peaking in February and just barely grew in July. The other major regional indexes have also shown a slower pace of growth, though New York has seen the most prolonged contraction.  “While this is just the first of regional indicators, it does a fairly good job of predicting what the others will do,” said Millan Mulraine, senior U.S. macroeconomic strategist at TD Securities.  “We’re still somewhat far off from getting into a double dip recession, but it suggests sluggish growth for the next quarter,” he added.  New orders in the state, whose businesses include manufacturers of industrial metals and capital equipment, fell to their lowest level since November 2010, slipping to minus 7.82 from minus 5.45.  But employment showed some improvement. The index for the number of employees inched up to 3.26 from 1.11 and the average employee work week index rose to minus 2.17 from minus 15.56.  Prices paid eased, falling to 28.26 from 43.33. The index was also at its lowest level since November 2010.  The outlook for the months to come also deteriorated, falling to the lowest since February 2009. The index of business conditions six months ahead dropped to 8.70 from 32.22.  Financial markets paid little attention to the day’s economic data. By late afternoon, U.S. stocks were more than 1 percent higher coming back from last week’s wild swings on bargain hunting, U.S. deal news and speculation European leaders may get control of the region’s debt problems.  Separate data also showed U.S. homebuilder sentiment was unchanged at a low level in August, as a glut of distressed homes, tight credit, and economic uncertainty kept new buyers out of the market.  The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index held at 15 in August, on target with economists’ expectations. It has hovered at historic lows between 14 and 22 since the start of 2008.  Readings below 50 mean more builders view market conditions as poor than favorable.  “Homebuilder sentiment is likely to remain subdued in the near term, with residential construction constrained by the elevated level of foreclosed properties on the market,” Michael Gapen, senior U.S. economist at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note.  Lowe’s, the U.S.’s second largest home improvement retailer, reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its fiscal-year outlook for the second time in three months as homeowners put off big renovations in an anemic economy.  Many U.S. homeowners have been hesitant to spend on expensive projects as housing prices fall and the economy shows few signs of a stable recovery.  In other data on Monday, foreigners unloaded U.S. assets in June for a second straight month and were net sellers of Treasuries for the first time in more than two years as a rancorous political debate over the nation’s debt raised concerns about U.S. credit quality.  Treasuries suffered a net outflow of $4.5 billion, the first since May 2009, but China, the largest foreign U.S. creditor, increased Treasury holdings by $5.7 billion to $1.166 trillion.

10,LOW,WRAPUP 3-NY factory index contracts for 3rd month," * New York manufacturing index unexpectedly slips in Aug  * New orders, prices paid indexes lowest since Nov 2010  * NAHB homebuilder index holds at 15, lending data mixed  * Atlanta Fed's Lockhart sees risks of recession rising  * Foreigners net sellers of U.S. assets in June (Adds details, quote)  By Leah Schnurr  NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Manufacturing in the New York area contracted for the third straight month in August, data showed on Monday, tempering any lingering hopes for a rebound in the U.S. economy in the second half of the year.  Manufacturing led the U.S. recovery in the past couple of years, even though it represents only about 12 percent of overall national output, but in recent months growth in the sector has slowed sharply.  The New York Federal Reserve's Empire State index showed the general business conditions index fell to minus 7.72 in August from minus 3.76 the month before. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of zero.  ""This is consistent with the negative tone that has permeated throughout the markets. Clearly we are not starting the new round of manufacturing data on good footing,"" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets.  The deterioration in the survey of manufacturing plants in New York state, the nation's third largest economy and the 14th biggest globally after Australia, bodes ill for the more widely followed Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index due out on Thursday. This in turn can be a harbinger for the larger national survey from the Institute for Supply Management at the beginning of September.  Separate data on Monday showed the housing sector remained weak with a gauge of homebuilder sentiment stuck at historic lows and as Lowe's Cos Inc (LOW.N) cut its fiscal-year outlook.  The Fed also said demand for consumer bank loans was largely flat over the past three months, while commercial and industrial lending saw some increased demand [ID:nN1E77E16B]  Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said risks of recession have risen over the last few months though he expected the economy could avoid an outright recession. [ID:nW1E7IR00Y]. Analysts said the New York report is cause for concern.  ""It certainly set a negative tone for the national ISM release that has been teetering at that break even point,"" said Lindsey Piegza, economist at FTN Financial in New York.  The ISM national factory activity index has dropped since peaking in February and just barely grew in July. The other major regional indexes have also shown a slower pace of growth, though New York has seen the most prolonged contraction.  ""While this is just the first of regional indicators, it does a fairly good job of predicting what the others will do,"" said Millan Mulraine, senior U.S. macroeconomic strategist at TD Securities.  ""We're still somewhat far off from getting into a double dip recession, but it suggests sluggish growth for the next quarter,"" he added.  New orders in the state, whose businesses include manufacturers of industrial metals and capital equipment, fell to their lowest level since November 2010, slipping to minus 7.82 from minus 5.45.  But employment showed some improvement. The index for the number of employees inched up to 3.26 from 1.11 and the average employee work week index rose to minus 2.17 from minus 15.56.  Prices paid eased, falling to 28.26 from 43.33. The index was also at its lowest level since November 2010.  The outlook for the months to come also deteriorated, falling to the lowest since February 2009. The index of business conditions six months ahead dropped to 8.70 from 32.22.  Financial markets paid little attention to the day's economic data. By late afternoon, U.S. stocks were more than 1 percent higher coming back from last week's wild swings on bargain hunting, U.S. deal news and speculation European leaders may get control of the region's debt problems.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   INSTANT VIEW-New York state manufacturing[ID:nN1E77E06D]   Graphic - New York manufacturing:   r.reuters.com/baz23s   Graphic - U.S. homebuilder sentiment:   r.reuters.com/naz23s   Graphic - Foreign holders of U.S. Treasuries:   r.reuters.com/caz23s   Graphic - Lowe's Q2 earnings:   r.reuters.com/qyx23s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  HOUSING HEADWINDS  Separate data also showed U.S. homebuilder sentiment was unchanged at a low level in August, as a glut of distressed homes, tight credit, and economic uncertainty kept new buyers out of the market.

It has hovered at historic lows between 14 and 22 since the start of 2008.  Readings below 50 mean more builders view market conditions as poor than favorable.  ""Homebuilder sentiment is likely to remain subdued in the near term, with residential construction constrained by the elevated level of foreclosed properties on the market,"" Michael Gapen, senior U.S. economist at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note.

11,LOW,"Homeowners delay renovations, Lowe's cuts forecast","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its fiscal-year outlook for the second time in three months as homeowners put off big renovations in an anemic U.S. economy.  The news pushed the second-largest home improvement chain’s shares down 1.3 percent on Monday, and made some analysts take a more cautious stance on retailers selling hard goods such as furniture and appliances.  Lowe’s is a victim of the ailing economy, weak housing market as well as cut-throat competition from larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N), analysts said.  “The bulk of what is happening here is that the economy has yet to give them traction,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst David Schick told Reuters.  U.S. homebuilder sentiment remained stuck near historic lows in August.  Consumer sentiment in the world’s largest economy worsened sharply in early August, falling to the lowest level in more than three decades. U.S. economic growth was anemic in the first half of the year.  “The volume of negative news and the unsettling impact on equity markets is having a significant effect on already fragile consumer mindset,” CEO Robert Niblock said on a conference call. “Consumers continue to focus on small ticket, less than $500, repair and maintenance items and projects.”  Lowe’s sales rose 1.3 percent to $14.54 billion in the second quarter, missing analysts’ estimate of $14.75 billion.  “Despite some recovery in our seasonal business, our performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations,” Niblock said.  Sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.3 percent. JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers was expecting same-store sales at Lowe’s to stay flat. Like many analysts, he expects industry leader Home Depot Inc (HD.N) to report better same-store sales when it reports quarterly results on Tuesday.  (For a related graphic, click r.reuters.com/qyx23s)  “The competitive landscape has changed. Five or ten years ago, Home Depot was not as competitive as they are today,” Schick said. “Home Depot becoming a more competitive, better run company makes it more difficult to get topline traction.”  Last week, Canadian rival Rona Inc RON.TO reported a steeper-than-expected 40 percent drop in quarterly profit.  BUDGET-CONSCIOUS SHOPPERS  Many U.S. homeowners have been hesitant to spend on expensive renovations as housing prices fall and the U.S. economy shows few signs of a stable recovery.  Home improvement chains have also found it harder to sell expensive items such as appliances.  On Monday, Barclays downgraded its view on the U.S. retail hardlines sector to “negative” from “neutral.”  Lowe’s, which closed seven underperforming stores, said it is now planning to offer more attractive opening price points and improve in-store layout to win shoppers. It is also launching the Spanish version of lowes.com this week.  Despite the weak outlook, analysts did not shun Lowe’s shares due to their attractive valuation.  “They do not have the momentum that Home Depot has and we expect Home Depot to report better results tomorrow but Lowe’s is cheaper and both valuations seem to incorporate a slowdown already,” Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said.  Lowe’s now sees sales rising about 2 percent for the fiscal year ending February 3, down from its prior forecast for a 4 percent increase.  Net income was $830 million, or 64 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $832 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding special items, it earned 68 cents a share. On that basis, analysts were expecting 66 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company now sees earnings of $1.48 to $1.54 a share for the year.

16,LOW,Home Depot raises outlook; eclipses Lowe's,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) raised its fiscal-year profit forecast for the second time in three months as timely promotions and a focus on cheaper products helped the No.1 home improvement chain gain market share from rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N).  The news, which boosted Home Depot shares 4.7 percent to $32.95 on Tuesday, came a day after Lowe’s cut its fiscal-year outlook for the second time in three months, highlighting the widening performance gap between the two.  Home Depot has gained from its recent efforts to improve distribution and customer service. It has been quicker to cut costs than Lowe's, and in some cases has benefited as housing markets have improved in regions where it has a heavy presence. (For a related graphic, click r.reuters.com/syc33s)  Same-store sales rose in all but three of its top 40 markets, with particular strength in Midwest and South Atlantic regions, CEO Frank Blake said, adding he was “encouraged that soft housing markets like California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada were positive in the quarter.”  Home Depot said it still expects fiscal-year sales to rise 2.5 percent. It forecast earnings of $2.34 a share excluding future stock repurchases, up from a prior forecast of $2.24.  “They are operating at a high level, taking chances where appropriate in merchandising, leveraging technology investments, and benefiting from a return to more localized marketing and merchandising in the store,” said analyst David Strasser of Janney Capital Markets.  In the second quarter, Home Depot’s sales at stores open at least a year, rose 4.3 percent globally, including a 3.5 percent rise in U.S. same-store sales, making it the ninth consecutive quarter that it has outshone its smaller rival. Lowe’s same-store sales fell 0.3 percent in the quarter.  Same-store sales thus far into August are “quite positive,” CFO Carol Tome said on a conference call.  Under Chief Executive Frank Blake, Home Depot has upgraded service and products in its core retail business  “They knew they were suffering on the customer service front. They really made an effort to turn that around... I think it is really paying off,” said Thomas Villalta, a portfolio manager at the Jones Villalta Opportunity Fund in Austin, Texas, which owns Home Depot shares.  Strasser said the 4.3 percent same-store sales rise was better than his 2.5 percent estimate. Promotional programs, including a U.S. Independence Day appliance event and a late July event on storage products, helped win shoppers, he added.  Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said that the stock is undervalued and set up for significantly stronger earnings when the housing sector stabilizes.  U.S. housing starts fell less than expected in July, a government report showed on Tuesday.  Still, U.S. homebuilder sentiment remained stuck near historic lows this month and consumer sentiment in the world’s largest economy fell to the lowest level in more than three decades in early August.  “The US housing market remains under stress,” CEO Blake said. “We do not expect any meaningful improvement in the housing market for the back half of 2011.”  Home Depot also beat estimates on quarterly profit as demand picked up for seasonal goods after a soft start to the spring selling season. Storm-related repairs also helped.  Its second-quarter net income rose to $1.36 billion, or 86 cents a share, from $1.19 billion, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 83 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Sales rose 4.2 percent to $20.23 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $19.96 billion.  Demand was strong for building materials and outdoor garden products. Home Depot has shifted focus to cheaper products such as faucets and paint to increase shopper traffic.  It reported a 1.1 percent rise in the number of customer transactions in the second quarter, while the average ticket rose 3.3 percent to $54.04.  Sales at home improvement chains have suffered as homeowners have stayed away from bigger renovations and expensive items such as appliances in a weak U.S. economy.  The company, which has bought back $2.3 billion of common shares year to date, is targeting about $1.2 billion of additional share repurchases for the rest of the year.

17,LOW,"Saks, Wal-Mart show widening U.S. consumer split","CHICAGO (Reuters) - At luxury department store chain Saks Inc SKS.N, customers were buying more designer suits at full price.  At Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), more customers were shopping with food stamps.  Wal-Mart and Saks, as well as home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and off-price apparel chain TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N), posted quarterly results that beat analysts’ expectations on Tuesday.  But company comments about consumer spending showed the split between upper-income consumers who have jobs and are little affected by rising costs for food and other essentials, and lower-income shoppers who are struggling with stubbornly high unemployment and rising costs.  “This is exactly what we continue to see quarter after quarter. There’s just significant bifurcation here,” Edward Jones retail analyst Matt Arnold said.  Wal-Mart said same-store sales at its U.S. discount stores, by far its largest business, fell 0.9 percent in the second quarter, the ninth straight quarterly decline at domestic stores open at least a year.  A weak U.S. economy has sent consumer sentiment to its lowest level since 1980, reflecting the additional stress on some consumers.  “They’re trading down to stretch their budgets, buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label, and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons,” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Mike Duke said in a recorded message.  Also, more shoppers are relying on government aid to help pay for food and other necessities, Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon said on the call.  The world’s largest retailer earned $1.09 per share from continuing operations in the second quarter, up from 97 cents a year earlier and near the high end of its forecast of $1.05 to $1.10.  Excluding a decline in the market value of currency derivatives, acquisition costs and other special items, profit was $1.12 per share, 4 cents above analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  FULL-PRICE/OFF-PRICE  Saks was able to beat expectations as it kept control of inventory, leading to more full-priced selling in its second quarter, which is typically a slow one for the retailer.  The company reported a loss of $8.4 million, or 5 cents per share, for the quarter ended July 30, compared with a loss of $32.2 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average expected a loss of 9 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company said it expects same-store sales to rise in the mid-to-high single digits on a percentage basis in the second half of the year. August sales were running in line with its fall-season forecast as its customers appeared to be shaking off the volatility in the financial markets.  “The affluent (shopper) has almost every piece of the puzzle in place other than housing,” Edward Jones’ Arnold said, referring to the housing market, which remains in a years-long slump.  Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said he does not expect meaningful improvement in the U.S. housing market this year.  But the home improvement chain has been able to beat out rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) by cutting costs more quickly and focusing on sales of lower-priced products to help increase traffic to its stores.

20,LOW,"Sears disappoints again, cuts more jobs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp’s (SHLD.O) quarterly loss almost quadrupled as the retailer failed to stop its prolonged sales decline even as it offered more margin-sapping discounts.  The news pushed down shares of the parent of the Sears department stores and Kmart discount chain by almost 7 percent to its lowest level in two years.  Sales at Sears Holdings have fallen every year since 2005, when billionaire investor Eddie Lampert formed the company by merging the two chains.  “Essentially, the message from consumers to Sears is “we will shop there, but not at the prices you wish to charge as we won’t pay full price for substandard service and unwelcoming physical facilities,” Credit Suisse’s Gary Balter said.  Sears shares fell 6.5 percent to $56.25  The retailer, home to brands such as Craftsman tools and Kenmore appliances, is a victim of the weak economy and stiff competition as well as its own problems.  Analysts have criticized Sears for relying too heavily on cost-cutting to boost profit, rather than upgrading its stores and improving its customer service.  It faces tough competition from retailers including Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Lowes Cos Inc (LOW.N), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Best Buy Co (BBY.N). It has been losing market share in appliances and apparel. For a related graphic, click r.reuters.com/fap33s Sears has made some decent investments in its internet offerings, but has fallen well behind the value offering at other rivals, Balter said.  The retailer has also been revamping its management team. It recently named former Hewitt Associates Chief Financial Officer Robert Schriesheim as its CFO and former FreshDirect executive Monica Woo as its new chief marketing officer. Former Avaya Inc AVXX.UL CEO Lou D’Ambrosio joined Sears as its CEO in February, ending the company’s three-year search for a new chief executive.  Sears Holdings has had trouble hiring executives since Lampert is seen as being difficult to work with and does not want to pay too much, Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand told Reuters in early August.  Higher costs also hurt Sears Holdings, which said it would lay off about 250 employees in support and field roles.  The news on Thursday came two months after the retailer laid off 700 employees who worked in the appliance section of its Kmart stores.  It is also closing 29 stores and seven product repair center locations, while converting 14 Sears Grand stores to Kmarts. The company said there could be more job cuts from those actions.  In the second quarter, sales fell 1.2 percent to $10.3 billion, while analysts expected $10.5 billion. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year fell 0.7 percent, with those at the namesake stores down 1.2 percent and Kmart staying flat.  The company blamed the lackluster sales numbers on weak demand for consumer electronics at both Sears and Kmart.  It took bigger discounts to boost sales of appliances, apparel and home goods. Sears is now trying to boost traffic by rolling out exclusive apparel brands with TV celebrities such as the Kardashians and Sophia Vergara.

Lowe’s, which has declared a cash dividend each quarter since going public in 1961, had raised its divided by 27 percent in May.  Last week, the retailer reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its fiscal-year outlook for the second time in three months as homeowners put off big renovations in an anemic U.S. economy.  U.S. companies are increasingly using their cash to buy back their own shares, as they bet on a Wall Street rebound. As of August 11, U.S. companies had bought back $305.2 billion in shares this year, eclipsing the $300.7 billion total for all of 2010 and two-and-a-half times the 2009 amount.  Shares of the company, which closed at $19.31 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, were inactive before the bell.

26,LOW,Lowe's trims management in turnaround effort,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos (LOW.N), the world’s second-largest home improvement chain, said on Monday that three senior executives had left the company as part of a management shake-up aimed at improving its U.S. operations.  The chain’s U.S. stores will now operate under three divisions — North, South and West. Previously, it had divided its largest market into at least five regions.  The news came just weeks after Lowe’s reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its fiscal-year outlook for the second time in three months. Lowe’s has underperformed larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) on the same-store sales front for nine straight quarters now.  “They are clearly taking cost out,” Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan said. “They are moving to a smaller organization, which is probably more appropriate considering they are no longer growing at the rate they were when they created the organization.”  As part of the changes, Theresa Anderson and Robert Wagner, previously senior vice presidents of operations, and Patricia Price, previously senior vice president and general merchandising manager of its home decor unit, will leave the company.  “This is not about dollar savings. This is about getting the right structure in place to move forward,” Lowe’s spokeswoman Chris Ahearn said.  Eric Sowder, senior vice president and general merchandising manager, outdoor living, had announced in July plans to retire from Lowe’s on September 9. Ahearn said that Sowder’s retirement was not related to the reorganization.  Sales at home improvement chains have declined as a weak economy and high unemployment have led shoppers to avoid costly renovations.  Home Depot has gained from its recent efforts to improve distribution and customer service. It has been quicker to cut costs than Lowe’s, and in some cases benefited as housing markets improved in regions where it has a heavy presence.  Lowe’s new structure with three regional divisions is similar to those at big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Home Depot, McGranahan said.  “Certainly, this is a structure that is tried and tested,” he said. McGranahan added: “They are trying to get some fresh perspective in the ranks too.”  The new structure will not change things in the short term but should help the company become more efficient down the road, he said.  On Monday, Lowe’s said it had also decided to consolidate its merchandising operations into two product units from four.  Lowe’s laid off about 1,700 middle managers across the United States in January as it faced the weak economy, soft housing market and stiff competition.  Lowe’s president and chief operating officer, Larry Stone, also retired on June 2 after 42 years with the company.  Shares of Lowe’s closed 1.2 percent higher at $20.49 on Monday.

28,LOW,Analysis: Sears needs more than Kardashians to save apparel,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When it comes to fashion, Sears may need an extreme makeover.  The 125-year-old department store chain has long been known more for tools and appliances, as opposed to cutting-edge fashions.  “The Sears brand doesn’t connote any sort of fashion sense,” said Craig Johnson, president of consulting firm Customer Growth Partners.  “It connotes ‘Oh yeah, that’s where my mother used to shop, or maybe my grandmother used to shop, or that is where my dad goes when his car battery dies,’” said Johnson.  Last month, the retailer sought to spice up its apparel image by enlisting TV’s glitzy Kardashian sisters to launch an exclusive line of clothing, the Kardashian Kollection, at 400 stores across the United States.  The line includes apparel, jewelry, handbags, lingerie and footwear featuring “Kim’s glamorous red carpet looks, Kourtney’s more Bohemian chic vibe and Khloe’s rocker style.”  Whether the Kardashians can succeed in making Sears more hip remains to be seen. At a Sears store in Jersey City, New Jersey, recently, one shopper said he never buys clothes there.  “I get better apparel for better prices elsewhere,” said Alex Torres, a 36-year-old airport supervisor.  Torres’ attitude epitomizes the problems facing Sears Holdings Corp, whose sales have fallen every year since 2005, when billionaire investor Eddie Lampert merged the Sears and Kmart chains.  In the most recent quarter, Sears Holdings’ net loss almost quadrupled to $146 million as it slashed prices to compete with the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Home Depot Inc.  Sears “does not pop up on most people’s radar screen when you are going to buy fashion,” consultant Johnson said, adding the company is better known for its tools, appliances and batteries.  “I call it a two-part issue. The first part of it is a fashion issue. The second issue is the brand itself. The umbrella brand is still Sears or Kmart. Both brands are damaged brands,” he said.  Also, even if a merchant gets its fashion right, selling clothes is a challenge, especially when it has a reputation for poor service and run-down stores — issues that have plagued Sears for some time as the department store has failed to invest enough in its stores.  “Sears has to invest in stores. Else, you face the prospects of becoming irrelevant,” said Mark Cohen, a marketing professor at Columbia Business School and a former chief executive officer of Sears Canada. “Sears stores are tragically underinvested.”  Others agreed.  “They have got to fix the box. They have got to make the stores look nicer. They have got to make the stores look contemporary,” America’s Research Group President Britt Beemer said.  Sears fights a tough battle on the apparel front with department stores including Macy’s, Kohl’s, Dillard’s and J.C. Penney.  “I think they missed the boat. They had their chance to reinvest in the stores. And now that the Internet is gaining more and more share ... they are too late,” said Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter. “They have lost the customer. You can see that from their numbers.”  Rather than spending too much to revive a lackluster apparel business, Sears should focus more on its signature brands such as Craftsman tools, Kenmore appliances and DieHard batteries, some analysts said.  “They can’t take resources away from those businesses to try to, you know, fix a dogged apparel business that’s never going to be that great,” Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand said. “I would rather see them defend their core strengths.”  Sears should “consider reinventing themselves as primarily a hardline business” and drastically cutting back on the number of stores, Johnson said.  The reason is that names like Craftsman and Kenmore have strong brand loyalty.  “I like Craftsman because they give me a lifelong guarantee,” said Oscar Alzade, a 54-year-old handyman.  There are fewer fans for Sears’ clothing lines.  “Lands’ End is a partial bright spot. The problem is that it has been so damaged within the Sears environment that the only time people buy it is when it goes on deep promotion,” Johnson said. Sears bought clothing chain Lands’ End in 2002.  Sears has been steadily losing share to retailers such as Lowe’s, Home Depot, Best Buy and hhgregg on the appliance front. Sears, which once used to own about 40 percent of the appliance market, has seen its share fall to about 27 percent, Johnson pointed out.  Still, getting out of the apparel business may be a hard decision, considering the unit accounted for about 15 percent of sales at the company’s namesake chain, Balter said.  Also, apparel is a high-margin business, so even sluggish sales can generate profits.  “Even though they are not doing well in apparel, it is still where the profit dollars come from,” Beemer said.

29,LOW,Lowe's shares poised for rebound - Barron's," Oct 2, Reuters - A strategy shift by Lowe’s Cos (LOW.N) could help beaten down shares of the world’s second-largest home-improvement chain climb nearly 50 percent in the next year, according to a report in Barron’s financial newspaper.   Lowe’s, which has been consistently underperforming larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and reported disappointing quarterly sales in August, has said it will shift away from frequent promotions to everyday low prices.   Analysts and investors believe the strategy and an aggressive share buyback program could get Lowe’s stock moving in the right direction, according to the Barron’s report.   It said Lowe’s stock could approach $30 in the next year as sales at its 1,753 stores and earnings climb.   Lowe’s shares closed at $19.34 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

30,LOW,Fortune Brands' home unit primed to invest,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc FBHS_w.N will be able to meet more of its own business needs, once it is spun off from Fortune Brands Inc FO.N and not worry about competing with booze and golf for funding, the company’s chief executive said.  The maker of Moen faucets, Simonton windows and Master Lock locks is ready to invest in new products and possibly even acquisitions, CEO Chris Klein told Reuters just hours before the spin-off due after the stock market close on Monday.  Klein said that when the unit becomes a pure-play company, it will be able to invest in more projects, especially “second-tier” priorities that may not have been met when it was competing for resources as part of a conglomerate that also makes Jim Beam bourbon and Titleist golf equipment.  “Historically we would’ve had all of our top priorities funded,” Klein said. “It’s that next tier, where there’s some very attractive organic growth opportunities .... This will allow us to increase investment there.”  He cited the Master Lock brand as one growth area, as well as international expansion.  Fortune Brands Home & Security starts trading independently on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The company’s “when-issued” shares traded at $12.20 on Monday afternoon, up 4 percent from their debut last month at $11.90.  Fortune’s remaining alcoholic drink business will trade as Beam Inc BEAM_w.N from Tuesday. That company’s “when-issued” shares were down 2.3 percent at $40.60. Fortune Brands fell 1 percent to $53.54 on its last day of trade on the NYSE.  Fortune Brands announced its break-up in December, saying it planned to spin off the home unit and sell or spin off its golf unit.  In May it said a group led by Fila Korea (081660.KS) would buy the golf business for $1.23 billion.  Even though Fortune said it planned to spin off the home unit, there was speculation on Wall Street about whether a buyer would emerge. The business was severely hurt when the bursting of the U.S. housing market crimped demand for its cabinets, doors, windows and faucets.  Klein declined to comment on future financial performance. In August, the company forecast mid-single-digit sales growth for the second half of 2011, outperforming an overall market it expected to be about flat.  The company derives 20 percent of its revenue from new home construction, Klein said, with the bulk coming from renovations and remodeling projects. About 26 percent of revenue comes from home goods stores like Lowes Cos Inc (LOW.N), Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O).  In September, the company adopted a poison pill to protect shareholders from any hostile takeover. Klein said the move was due to market volatility, rather than a specific threat.  “We thought it was very much in the best interest of the shareholders ... to control the destiny of the company as it comes out, when it otherwise could have been vulnerable, really, just to volatility in the marketplace,” Klein said.  As for acquisitions, Klein said the company would be open.  “We’re not going to run out and say we need to do acquisitions but we’re open to looking at things that are out there, and would look at opportunities if they accelerated where we’re focused organically,” Klein said, pointing to home goods that consumers pick out, rather than generic building products.  He said small- to mid-sized companies would likely provide the right fit, given his firm’s debt of $520 million, credit facility of $1 billion and debt-to-earnings ratio of 1.8.

31,LOW,September likely good enough for most U.S. chains,"   * Same-store sales rise of 4.6 pct seen -Thomson Reuters   * Costco’s sales better than expected, Walgreen’s weaker   * Zumiez blows past expectations, raises guidance   By Jessica Wohl   Oct 6 (Reuters) - Bargain hunters helped retailers including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) post strong September sales even as the stock market tumbled and consumer sentiment sagged.   Overall, U.S. retailers that report monthly sales are expected to post an average gain of 4.6 percent in sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, according to Thomson Reuters.   Retailers are doing what they can to appeal to shoppers such as Joanna Polowitz, who said that she lost her job a month ago and thinks that the economy is getting worse.   “I’m definitely holding back, only buying necessities, socks for my son, food because it’s reasonable here,” Polowitz said as she shopped at a Walmart in North Bergen, New Jersey on Wednesday. “We’re buckling down, not going to dinner as much.” Most of the 23 retailers that still report monthly sales — chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) have abandoned the practice — issue their reports on Thursday.   Wednesday’s results were a mixed bag.   Costco, the largest warehouse chain, saw same-store sales, rise 12 percent in September, topping analysts’ forecast for 10.1 percent rise. [ID:nL3E7L517B]   And Zumiez Inc (ZUMZ.O), which sells clothing and equipment for sports such as skating and snowboarding, posted a 10.1 percent rise in same-store sales, while analysts were looking for just a 3.2 percent increase, and raised its profit forecast. [ID:nASA02WTM]   Walgreen Co’s WAG.N sales rose less than expected, due in part to a slower start to the flu season. [ID:nN1E7940AE]   The U.S. consumer in September “showed resilience in spite of all the troubling economic news,” but higher gasoline prices than a year earlier are still a factor, said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse.   McNamara and others noted that Hurricane Irene, which battered the U.S. East Coast at the end of August, may have shifted some spending in September to home improvement.   Chains including Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) and Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O), which sell generators and other storm-related items, do not report monthly sales.   September is a particularly important time for retailers focused on children’s and young adult apparel. Back-to-school shopping is the second-largest retail spending season behind the holiday period of November and December.   Same-store sales rose 4.4 percent in September, according to data released by the Johnson Redbook Retail Sales Index on Tuesday. That index measures a sample of large general merchandise retailers.

Lowe’s, which operates about 1,700 stores in the United States, said on Monday that it had closed 10 on Sunday and would close another 10 within a month. Some 1,950 workers will be laid off. As of January, Lowe’s had 161,000 full-time and 73,000 part-time employees. The company also said it planned to open only 10 to 15 new North American stores per year starting in 2012, down from a previous goal of 30. Shares of Lowe’s were up 2.8 percent at $21.37 in morning trading. Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said in a statement that the company had to “make tough decisions” to improve profitability. Lowe’s has been slower to cut costs than market leader Home Depot Inc (HD.N), whose sales at stores open a year or more have beaten its rival’s for nine straight quarters. “This continues (Lowe’s) progress toward becoming a more efficient operator,” Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said in a research note on Monday. “Management is making significant changes that should improve returns.” Expenses from the closings will come to between $100 million and $130 million, including lease obligations, employee layoffs and inventory adjustments, Lowe’s said.

From stepping up efforts to attract online shoppers to slashing prices permanently, Lowe’s is reworking its strategy to outdo the market leader. “We believe that through kind of the first part of 2012, we start to make up some ground and you start to see maybe us closing that gap in the second half of 2012,” CEO Robert Niblock told Reuters in a telephone interview. Lowe’s, a victim of the weak economy and housing market, has been slower to cut costs than Home Depot, whose sales at stores open a year or more have beaten its rival’s for nine straight quarters. In the third quarter, Lowe’s same-store sales performance was lackluster and below some analysts’ estimates. Sales at stores open at least a year rose just 0.7 percent. Analyst Alan Rifkin at Barclays was looking for a 1 percent increase. Demand for expensive renovations is still weak, Niblock said. “For big-ticket categories to become really healthy, primarily we need home prices to start appreciating,” he said, adding that U.S. consumers still have a “fragile mindset” due to high unemployment and economic uncertainty. Home Depot is due to report its quarterly results on Tuesday. Analysts across the board expect the market leader to outperform Lowe’s as it stands to benefit from recent moves to improve its distribution and customer service and cut costs. “They have been feeding share to Home Depot,” Rifkin said of Lowe’s. A recent move to offer low prices permanently rather than temporary discounts has helped Lowe’s sales a little but hurt margins, he added. “We do prefer Home Depot over Lowe’s,” Rifkin said. Others agreed. “There is still room for Home Depot to outperform relative to Lowe’s heading into 2012. What Lowe’s needs to do is take a hard look at their merchandising, their supply chain, their operations in order to flip that back into their favor,” Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom said. On Monday, Niblock said he sees more room to cut costs. Lowe’s shares were up 2 percent at $23.58 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Lowe’s recently revamped its management and regional structure in an attempt to improve its U.S. operations. Its U.S. stores now operate under three divisions — North, South and West. Previously, it divided its largest market into at least five regions. The chain also consolidated its merchandising operations into two product units from four. Last month, Lowe’s said it was closing 20 of its U.S. locations and eliminating nearly 2,000 jobs, and slashing its store-opening plans to improve profitability. It laid off about 1,700 middle managers across the United States in January. The company nudged its fiscal 2011 sales growth forecast higher, to a range of 2 percent to 3 percent from its August forecast of 2 percent. Lowe’s said net income fell to $225 million, or 18 cents a share, in the third quarter ended October 28, from $404 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to store closings and discontinued projects, it earned 35 cents a share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 33 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2.3 percent to $11.85 billion, while analysts expected $11.69 billion. It expects full-year profit of $1.37 to $1.40 a share, including charges of 20 cents a share associated with store closings and discontinued projects. “Although Lowe’s benefits from a relatively attractive valuation, we see limited upside potential from current levels based on our view of likely continued same-store sales underperformance vs. principal competitor Home Depot,” Citigroup analyst Kate McShane wrote.

Last month, Lowe’s said it was closing 20 of its U.S. locations and eliminating nearly 2,000 jobs, and slashing its store-opening plans to improve profitability. It laid off about 1,700 middle managers across the United States in January. The company nudged its fiscal 2011 sales growth forecast higher, to a range of 2 percent to 3 percent from its August forecast of 2 percent. Lowe’s said net income fell to $225 million, or 18 cents a share, in the third quarter ended Oct. 28, from $404 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to store closings and discontinued projects, it earned 35 cents a share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 33 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2.3 percent to $11.85 billion, while analysts expected $11.69 billion. It expects full-year profit of $1.37 to $1.40 a share, including charges of 20 cents a share associated with store closings and discontinued projects. “Although Lowe’s benefits from a relatively attractive valuation, we see limited upside potential from current levels based on our view of likely continued same-store sales underperformance vs. principal competitor Home Depot,” Citigroup analyst Kate McShane wrote.",11142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/lowes/update-5-lowes-vows-fight-as-analysts-favor-home-depot-idUSNL3E7ME1M20111114

38,LOW,Home Depot outshines Lowe's again; ups outlook,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) raised its fiscal-year outlook for the third time in six months as a host of efforts to improve distribution and boost customer service helped the No. 1 home improvement chain gain share from archrival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N). Home Depot, which reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday, also raised its quarterly dividend by 16 percent to 29 cents per share. The news came a day after Lowe’s also beat quarterly profit estimates and laid out a blueprint to win back shoppers from its larger competitor. Home Depot has benefited from more centralized distribution centers, better merchandising tools, efforts to shift more employees to jobs where they serve customers directly and the use of more technology in stores. The company has also been quicker to cut costs than Lowe’s, and in some cases has benefited as housing markets have improved in regions where it has a heavy presence. Home Depot has also gained from its slower expansion strategy. Under Chief Executive Frank Blake, Home Depot has been closing concept stores and upgrading service and products in its core retail business to win market share from Lowe’s. Blake, who became chairman and CEO in early 2007 after Robert Nardelli resigned, returned the company’s focus to being the regular big-box strip-mall type store and improving its merchandise, supply chain and customer service. “Overall, they are just out-executing Lowe’s at this point,” RBC Capital Markets Scot Ciccarelli said. “Lowe’s is trying to copy a lot of these same efforts that I think have helped Home Depot, but it is going to take a while for them to benefit from some of the changes that they are currently making.” Home Depot’s sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.2 percent globally, including a 3.8 percent rise in the United States. This was the 10th consecutive quarter that the company has outshone Lowe’s, whose same-store sales rose 0.7 percent in the quarter. Both chains got a lift from sales related to Hurricane Irene. The home improvement industry grew 2 percent in the 12 months ending September 2011, a report from market research firm NPD showed. However, the industry — pressured by the weak economy and housing market — is still down 7 percent compared with the same time period in 2009. “We still don’t see and we don’t expect to see in the near term any meaningful tailwind from the housing market,” Home Depot’s CEO said on Tuesday, echoing comments from Lowe’s CEO Robert Niblock earlier this week. Net income rose to $934 million, or 60 cents a share in the third quarter ended on October 30, from $834 million, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 58 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 4.4 percent to $17.33 billion, beating the analysts’ average estimate of $17.12 billion. For the current fiscal year, Home Depot sees earnings of $2.38 a share, up from its prior outlook of $2.34. It continues to expect sales to rise 2.5 percent in the period. The strong results from Home Depot coincided with a report from the Commerce Department that showed U.S. retail sales rose broadly in October, suggesting the economy started the fourth quarter with some strength. Home Depot shares, which had risen as much as 1.3 percent earlier on Tuesday, were down 8 cents at $38.17 on the New York Stock Exchange.

40,LOW,TEXT-S&P;:Lowe's downgraded to 'A-' on aggressive financial policy,"Nov 15- — Mooresville, N.C.-based Lowe’s financial policy has become more aggressive, a factor which we base on its announcement that it is relaxing its internal target leverage metric to 2.25x from 1.8x. — We expect the economy to remain weak over at least the next few quarters. — We are lowering all of the home improvement retailer’s ratings, including the corporate credit rating to ‘A-‘ from ‘A’ and the short-term rating to ‘A-2’ from ‘A-1’. — The negative outlook reflects the company’s willingness to continue to assume higher debt levels during a weak economic environment, and its under-performance relative to Home Depot . Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said today that it lowered all of the long-term and short-term ratings on Lowe’s Cos. Inc., including the corporate credit rating to ‘A-‘ from ‘A’ and the short-term and commercial paper (CP) rating to ‘A-2’ from ‘A-1’. The outlook is negative. As of Oct. 28, 2011, Lowe’s had about $6.6 billion of debt outstanding. “The rating action reflects Lowe’s more aggressive financial policy, as signaled by the relaxation of its internal target leverage metric to 2.25x from 1.8x,” said Standard & Poor’s credit analyst Jerry Phelan. He explained, “We believe this will lead to commensurate weakening credit protection measures.” Lowe’s financial policy over the last two years has become more aggressive despite a deep economic downturn, fragile economic recovery, and an economy that could lapse back into recession. The ratings on Lowe’s reflect Standard & Poor’s opinion that the company should continue to report good profitability and free cash flow, despite the probability of significantly higher share repurchase activity, weaker credit measures, and our expectation for tough economic conditions. Our assessment that Lowe’s business risk profile will remain strong reflects its favorable No. 2 market position in the retail home improvement industry, overall satisfactory operating performance, and substantial cash flow generation, despite intense competition from its larger rival Home Depot Inc. Lowe’s intermediate financial risk profile is based on our belief that the company will reach its more aggressive 2.25x internal target leverage metric over the next 12 to 18 months. (We estimate Lowe’s 2.25x internal leverage metric is equal to about 2.3x under our lease-adjusted leverage calculations.) The negative outlook reflects the company’s willingness to continue to assume higher debt levels during a weak economic environment and its underperformance relative to Home Depot. We estimate total stock repurchases over the next year could reach $4.5 billion to $5 billion, including about $2.85 billion through debt-financing. We could lower the rating if we believe credit measures could deteriorate below our current expectations, due to a combination of meaningful debt-financed share repurchases and lower profitability associated with a protracted recession and an intensely competitive pricing environment. We could also consider a downgrade if Lowe’s financial policy becomes even more aggressive than we currently expect, including a further relaxation of its target leverage metric, a meaningful acquisition, or if leverage approaches 2.5x (based on our lease-adjusted calculations). We estimate this could occur if EBITDA falls by about 10% and Lowe’s uses all of its free cash flow, plus the proceeds from about $2.6 billion of debt issuances, to repurchase its common stock. We could revise the outlook to stable if Lowe’s comparable-store sales and profit performance begin to improve relative to market leader Home Depot, and if we become comfortable that the company will maintain its revised financial policy.

41,LOW,Retailers adapt as mobile holiday shopping booms,"(Reuters) - When it comes to holiday shopping, more people are phoning it in, forcing retailers to embrace new ways to connect or else lose sales. Lowe’s Companies, Best Buy and Toys R Us are among retailers making big changes to prepare for a wave of holiday shoppers who will use smart phones to research products, check rivals’ prices and make purchases. “The shopping experience is in the consumer’s hands and you can’t fight where they’re going,” said Gihad Jawhar, vice president of Lowes.com, the website of the second-largest home-improvement company. “Retailers can either hop on the bus or get left behind. We are choosing the first option.” Lowe’s is issuing more than 42,000 Apple iPhones to employees in more than 1,700 stores. When shoppers are in Lowes stores scanning bar codes with their phones, reading product reviews and checking prices, employees can engage them better using iPhones to track down similar information. Staff can also check quickly if products are in stock or if items are available on Lowes’ website or another store nearby, and can often match or beat a price a consumer finds elsewhere via a smart phone. Best Buy has 63 so-called connected stores in which employees have been given mobile devices and are encouraged to use their own smart phones to help shoppers research products and check inventory. “Employees are empowered to make the decision to match a competitor price on the spot,” a spokeswoman for Best Buy added. More than 40 percent of retailers this year have a policy of at least competing with lower online prices found through mobile comparisons. Ahead of last year’s holiday season, most retailers were still in denial about this trend, according to research firm RSR. The mobile shopping boom is putting billions of dollars in sales up for grabs in an industry that is being pummeled by lackluster economic growth and weak consumer confidence. U.S. retail e-commerce holiday sales will rise 17 percent to $46.7 billion in 2011, while total retail sales will grow about 3 percent this season, eMarketer forecast on Thursday. But mobile commerce is growing even faster. The 300 largest U.S. mobile merchants, led by Amazon.com Inc, will generate $5.37 billion in sales through mobile devices this year, more than double 2010, according to a recent survey by Internet Retailer. A recent survey of shoppers by the National Retail Federation found that 40 percent own a smart phone and more than half of those people plan to use their device to research products or make a purchase this holiday. The peak day for mobile holiday shopping is expected to be the second Sunday in December (December 11 this year), according to PayPal, the online payments business owned by eBay Inc. That’s the last non-work day when orders will be shipped in time for Christmas. Last year on that day, total payment volume, or TPV, transmitted by mobile devices through PayPal’s system was $4.7 million. This year PayPal expects more than $10 million of TPV on that shopping day. “Retailers are waking up to the fact that shopping is changing very rapidly. Some wish that weren’t true — they would like to ban smart phones in their stores,” said John Donahoe, chief executive of eBay. “But others are embracing it. They have got to get to where consumers are making their decisions.” Amazon, eBay and J.C. Penney are among potential winners from the mobile shopping boom, according to Paula Rosenblum, managing partner at RSR. J.C. Penney launched a mobile version of its website earlier than many traditional retailers and included easy-to-use features such as wish lists that can be shared with friends, Rosenblum said. J.C. Penney has seen weak sales recently, but Rosenblum said the long-term result of having a strong mobile offering should be increased same-store sales growth. “Some retailers may have done nothing in mobile and still have rising year-over-year sales, but long-term that won’t last,” Rosenblum added. EBay recently launched a new version of its Red Laser app, which lets shoppers scan bar codes and check prices at other retailers with their smart phones. Amazon also unveiled a new version of its Price Check app this week. Red Laser now includes local inventory data from Milo, a business eBay bought last year, and a PayPal mobile checkout button. There is also a button smart phone users can tap to pick up their holiday items at physical store locations. Retailers including Toys R Us, the largest toy retailer in the United States, and Best Buy have shared local inventory data with Milo. That means shoppers using the Red Laser smart phone app may buy something from them and end up at their physical stores. Unlike the Internet alone — which has pulled more sales out of stores — mobile commerce can actually help brick-and-mortar retailers get a sale, by telling shoppers where to find the deals and items they want while they are actually out shopping. “That’s a big deal for retailers, after so many years when the Internet has been driving consumers away from stores,” said Cyriac Roeding, chief executive of Shopkick, which has a location-based mobile shopping app. Shopkick’s app encourages its 2.5 million users to visit stores by sending discounts and rewards to their smart phones when they scan product bar codes.

43,LOW,Lowe's undergoing makeover to win shoppers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - From improving signage to adding more technology to its stores, Lowe’s (LOW.N) is undergoing a major makeover as the No. 2 home improvement chain tries to woo shoppers away from larger rival Home Depot (HD.N). At an investor meeting on Tuesday, its top executives laid out a plan to make the retailer more friendly to shoppers who `are increasingly becoming better at “comparison shopping.” The news comes after Lowe’s underperformed Home Depot on the same-store sales front for 10 straight quarters, increasing the pressure on the smaller chain to find ways to differentiate itself from the market leader. Lowe’s said it was now shifting away from promotions to more everyday low prices, offering more localized products, improving its website and working to improve the in-store experience by using better signage and technology in stores. For instance, Lowe’s has issued more than 42,000 Apple (AAPL.O) iPhones to employees in more than 1,700 stores so that they can help shoppers who will use smart phones to research products, check rivals’ prices and make purchases. The company is also increasing its assortment of products online. It launched mylowes.com in mid-October, a site that allows consumers to save their room dimensions, create a shopping list and even set reminders for recurring items. “We live in an increasingly seamless, socially connected world,” Chief Executive Robert Niblock told investors at a meeting that was webcast over the Internet. “We have to meet customers on their terms.” Lowe’s is also installing television displays that stream videos to educate shoppers on how to do projects and lowering certain product racks to make items more accessible. On Tuesday, Lowe’s also reiterated its outlook for the current fiscal year. It continues to see sales rising 2 percent to 3 percent in the fiscal year ending February 3. It also backed its profit forecast of $1.37 a share to $1.40 a share, including charges of 20 cents a share associated with store closings and discontinued projects. During an interview last month, CEO Robert Niblock told Reuters that the planned efforts will not bear fruit right away. “We believe that through kind of the first part of 2012, we start to make up some ground and you start to see maybe us closing that gap in the second half of 2012,” Niblock said. Still, many look at the new strategy as a step in the right direction. “While these initiatives will take time to impact results, the message that Lowe’s is actively working to improve the business should ring clear,” Baird analyst Peter Benedict wrote. Last week, Goldman Sachs advised clients to buy Lowe’s calls ahead of the analyst meeting and sell rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) calls to fund the purchase. Goldman on Friday upgraded Lowe’s to “Buy” from “Neutral” on the view that management of the chain “is embracing the need for meaningful upgrades to the business after years of drift.” Lowe’s recently revamped its management and regional structure in an attempt to improve its U.S. operations. Its U.S. stores now operate under three divisions — North, South and West. Previously, it divided its largest market into at least five regions. The chain also consolidated its merchandising operations into two product units from four. In October, Lowe’s said it was closing 20 of its U.S. locations and eliminating nearly 2,000 jobs, and slashing its store-opening plans to improve profitability. It laid off about 1,700 middle managers across the United States in January. (Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by Gerald E.

44,LOW,Lowe's defends pulling ads from Muslim TV show,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. home improvement chain Lowe’s Monday defended its decision to pull advertising from reality TV show “All-American Muslim” amid charges the company had given in to bigotry. “All-American Muslim,” which airs on TLC, follows several Muslim families in and around the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to one of the largest Muslim populations in the United States and its largest mosque. It has been accused by one Florida group to be propaganda. But the decision by Lowe’s sparked an outcry by defenders of the show. Lowe’s employed its Facebook page to defend itself and called “All-American Muslim,” a “lightning rod” for “strong political and societal views.” Lowe’s spokeswoman Karen Cobb said the company was one of “dozens” of companies to pull their advertising late last month. Names of other companies were not immediately available. Laurie Goldberg, a TLC spokeswoman, declined to say how many companies have pulled their advertising from the show, which attracts about a million viewers per week. “We stand behind the show ‘All-American Muslim’ and we’re happy the show has strong advertising support,” Goldberg said. Hip hop mogul Russell Simmons said in a series of messages on Twitter defending the embattled reality T.V. show that he had bought up the remaining ad spots. “Just purchased remaining spots for #allamericanmuslim for next week,” Simmons said. “The show is now sold out! keep your money @lowes and we will keep ours.” A spokeswoman for Simmons said he had purchased two 30-second ads, but said Simmons had not decided what the content of those ads would be. The Florida Family Association, a little-known group that has campaigned against the show, has branded “All-American Muslim” “propaganda” that is “clearly designed to counter legitimate and present-day concerns about many Muslims who are advancing Islamic fundamentalism and Sharia law.” But U.S. Representative Keith Ellison, who is Muslim, said in a statement that Lowe’s had “chosen to uphold the beliefs of a fringe hate group” and given in to intolerance. “Corporate America needs to take a stand against these anti-Muslim fringe groups and stand up for what is right because this is what it means to be an American,” he said.

Laurie Goldberg, a TLC spokeswoman, declined to say how many companies have pulled their advertising from the show, which attracts about a million viewers per week. “We stand behind the show All American Muslim and we’re happy the show has strong advertising support,” Goldberg said. Hip hop mogul Russell Simmons announced on Monday in a series of messages on Twitter defending the embattled reality T.V. show that he had bought up the remaining ad spots. “Just purchased remaining spots for #allamericanmuslim for next week,” Simmons said. “The show is now sold out! keep your money @lowes and we will keep ours.” A spokeswoman for Simmons said he had purchased two 30-second ads, but said Simmons had not decided what the content of those ads would be. The Florida Family Association, a little-known group that has campaigned against the show, has branded “All-American Muslim” “propaganda” that is “clearly designed to counter legitimate and present-day concerns about many Muslims who are advancing Islamic fundamentalism and Sharia law.” But U.S. Representative Keith Ellison, who is Muslim, said in a statement that Lowe’s had “chosen to uphold the beliefs of a fringe hate group” and given in to intolerance. “Corporate America needs to take a stand against these anti-Muslim fringe groups and stand up for what is right because this is what it means to be an American,” he said.

The results echoed those from larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N), which also reported stellar sales due to strong demand for everything from paint to concrete in the unseasonably warm quarter. Lowe’s results came just days after a host of data pointed to a budding housing recovery after years of weakness and excited some industry-watchers over the prospects of the home-improvement segment. “We encourage investors to look past the near term and think about double-digit margins for all when housing recovers,” said Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter, who has an “outperform” rating on both chains.

49,LOW,"Lowe's lays out plan to boost sales, eyes acquisitions","EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), the world’s second-largest home improvement chain, is working on its own home project. After trailing larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in same-store sales for 11 straight quarters, Lowe’s is now investing in everything from in-store technology to its online business to win back shoppers from the industry leader. “We recognized that a lot of our ills aren’t just housing-related or macro-related, just some things we needed to fix ourselves,” Robert Hull, who has served as Lowe’s chief financial officer since March 2003, told Reuters on Tuesday. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Lowe's vs Home Depot graphic: link.reuters.com/jaw47s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Hull said the company’s online business, which accounted for about 1 percent of total sales in 2011, could easily generate 5 percent to 10 percent of sales in five years. Lowe’s, which recently bought online home-goods chain ATG Stores, said more acquisitions have the potential to boost that business. “Everything we did (in the past) was store-centric. Today, we are all about the customer. So, it’s about meeting the customer on their terms, no matter how they choose to interact with Lowe’s: whether it is in their room, at their jobsite, on the phone or on the Web,” Hull said. He also said he sees opportunity for 100 stores in Canada, up from 31 now, which are mostly in Ontario. Hull said he was open to all options when asked about Lowe’s interest in buying Canadian rival Rona Inc RON.TO, if that chain were to put itself up for sale. Some investors said late last year that it made sense for the two chains to get together to better fight Home Depot. He called Rona a “very interesting company” and said it had many attractive qualities like its footprint in Quebec, a market where Lowe’s has hardly any presence at the moment. Rona was not immediately available for comment. Rona’s shares rose 12.2 percent to C$10.49 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Lowe’s shares closed down 1 percent at $31.07 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Rona, once Canada’s dominant do-it-yourself chain, has fared poorly as Lowe’s and Home Depot have made inroads in the country. Same-store sales fell 7.3 percent in the fiscal year ended December 25, 2011. The Canadian company said on February 23 that it was shifting its focus from big-box stores, and would close or reduce the size of 23 outlets to stay competitive. In October, Lowe’s said it was closing 20 of its U.S. locations and eliminating nearly 2,000 jobs, and slashing its store-opening plans to improve profitability. It laid off about 1,700 middle managers across the United States in January 2011, and also trimmed the number of its U.S. regions and merchandising units. Hull, who said he expects Lowe’s makeover to start bearing fruit in 2012, said seasonal products have sold well so far this spring, partly due to the warmer-than-usual weather. That prompted many homeowners to take up renovation projects earlier than usual this year, helping Lowe’s and Home Depot to report strong sales for their fiscal fourth quarters, ended about February 1. Lowe’s initiatives include a shift from promotions to more everyday low prices. It has also started offering more localized products and made its stores more appealing with improved signs, television displays that stream videos to educate shoppers on how-to-do projects, and lower racks to make items easier to reach. Lowe’s launched mylowes.com in mid-October, a site that allows shoppers to save their room dimensions, create a shopping list and set reminders for recurring items such as air filters and batteries for smoke alarms. It has given more than 42,000 Apple (AAPL.O) iPhones to employees in more than 1,700 stores so that they can help shoppers who use smart phones to research products, check rivals’ prices and make purchases. It has given iPads to store managers so that they can spend more time on the sales floor. Lowe’s, which has already launched iPhone and iPad apps, plans to offer Android and other apps soon. Lowe’s also hopes to let customers pay with their smartphones at some point. It also increased its assortment of products online and will continue to do so, said Robert Gfeller, who was named executive vice president of merchandising in January 2011. During a tour of Lowe’s store in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gfeller highlighted how the company is now placing many new products, such as Broan bath fans and recessed-to-pendant light conversion kits, right at the front of the aisle to catch the attention of shoppers. “We are trying to push out ahead of the customer, out ahead of the season to be seen as differentiated in the marketplace, in a way that we really haven’t been,” Gfeller said.

54,LOW,Freescale names TI's Lowe as CEO,"(Reuters) - Chip maker Freescale Semiconductor Holdings Ltd named Gregg Lowe, a long-time executive of rival Texas Instruments Inc, as its new CEO, sending Freescale shares up 8 percent. Lowe, who joined Texas Instruments in 1984 and most recently headed analog semiconductors - a key business for TI, will succeed Rich Beyer, who has headed Freescale for four years. Analysts said that the hire was good news for Freescale, which is seen benefiting from Lowe’s customer relationships as well as his management experience. “In our view, Mr. Lowe is a very strong hire, having managed the Analog division at TXN, which accounts for (about 15 percent) worldwide market share, representing the leadership position in the analog market,” said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. Another analyst, Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein, said Lowe’s experience with the U.S. and European automotive industry, where he focused at the start of his TI career, will fit well with Freescale, which gains 40 percent of its revenue from chips used in the automotive industry. Like TI, Freescale sells chips for a wide range of products, including industrial equipment, cellphones and consumer products. Rasgon noted that Lowe had started his career at TI in the company’s U.S. and European automotive business, But Rasgon said that leading Freescale, which needs to de-leverage its balance sheet, will be “one of the more difficult jobs in semiconductors right now.” Freescale’s Beyer had said in April that he would retire. Beyer will continue to serve on Freescale’s board to ensure a smooth transition, the company said in a statement. Lowe will be succeeded at Texas Instruments by Senior Vice President Brian Crutcher, Texas Instruments said. Williams Financial Group analyst Cody Acree said Lowe’s departure would be bad news for TI but he noted that the company is left with a very strong management team. “To the extent Gregg can make Freescale stronger and a better competitor that means TI has to work that much harder to maintain their market share gains,” Acree said. Freescale shares were up 70 cents or 8 percent to $9.44 in afternoon trade on New York Stock Exchange. TI shares were up 11 cents, or 0.4 percent at $27.20, on Nasdaq.

55,LOW,Retail sales fall for third straight month in June,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Retail sales fell in June for the third straight month, the longest run of consecutive drops since 2008 when the country was mired in recession. Sales slipped 0.5 percent, with declines across a wide swath of industries from electronics and cars to building supplies, the Commerce Department said on Monday. Analysts had expected a small increase. “Evidence is increasingly clear that the U.S. economy is slowing,” said Jim Baird, an investment strategist at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The report adds to a spate of soft economic data that is raising pressure on President Barack Obama ahead of his November re-election bid. Republican challenger Mitt Romney is focusing his campaign on the weak economy, which has plagued Obama’s presidency. The dollar declined against the euro and the yield on 10-year U.S. government bonds dropped to an all-time low as the data stoked worries the economy was floundering and could need more help from the Federal Reserve. U.S. stock prices sank. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will testify to lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday on the Fed’s view of the economy. Job creation in the United States has slowed dramatically in the last few months as employers worry about a sagging global economy hurt by Europe’s snowballing debt crisis. Bernanke’s peers at central banks in China, the euro zone and Britain have eased monetary policy this summer to prop up their economies. The International Monetary Fund slashed its forecast for global economic growth on Monday and urged European policymakers to take bolder action to stem their crisis. It also warned that China’s economy risks a hard landing. The U.S. factory sector also has shown signs of contraction due to the global slowdown, although on Monday a survey showed New York state manufacturers perked up in July. Still, new orders shrank at the state’s factories. The retail data is worrisome because it suggests consumer spending, which drives about two-thirds of the economy, is also sagging. “This is another example of how broader economic uncertainty is having an impact on economic activity,” said Eric Fine, managing director of Van Eck G-175 strategies in New York. JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli called the retail report “ugly across the board,” lowering the firm’s forecast for second-quarter economic growth to 1.4 percent from 1.7 percent. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter. Separately, a poll showed on Monday that American companies are scaling back plans to hire workers with a rising share of firms saying the European debt crisis is taking a bite out of their sales. Forty-seven percent of companies surveyed felt their sales have dropped due to Europe’s woes. Among companies that produce goods rather than provide services, the impact was even greater. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said U.S. business inventories rose in May as motor vehicle dealers restocked to meet demand. Demand, however, looked weak in June. The retail sales report showed receipts at motor vehicle and parts dealers dropped 0.6 percent last month. Sales at electronics and appliance stores declined 0.8 percent, and were down 1.8 percent at gasoline stations, reflecting a decline in gasoline prices. Often, relief at the pump allows consumers to spend their money elsewhere. But that didn’t seem to be the case in June. “The consumer is obviously struggling, not benefiting much from weak gasoline prices,” said David Sloan, an economist at 4Cast in New York. And gasoline prices might not continue to decline. So far in July, prices for crude oil have risen. Consumers also face the prospect of higher taxes and less government spending next year, a combination that could potentially push the economy into recession. Lawmakers are debating how to avoid this “fiscal cliff,” which is built into current law. Democrats warned on Monday they are prepared to let all Bush-era tax cuts expire if Republicans insist on extending lower rates for top earners.

56,LOW,Analysis: Rona looks outside the big box for a turnaround,"BOUCHERVILLE, Quebec (Reuters) - Rona Inc, Canada’s home-grown answer to Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Cos Inc, has built its turnaround plan around a bold theory: the golden age of the big box store is ending. For years, Rona organized its business around cracking the big box market. Now, facing sluggish consumer confidence and smarting from falling sales at established stores, it is closing or splitting up 23 of its 79 biggest outlets. Luc Rodier, Rona’s executive vice president for retail, says the novelty and excitement of bigger formats has worn off for consumers, and the performance of Rona’s smaller stores shows customers want to shop in smaller outlets, closer to home. Under a strategic plan announced in February, Rona is opening more “satellite” and “proximity” outlets that run 5,000 to 35,000 square feet, rather than the 100,000 square feet-plus found at most big boxes. “A nice 100,000 square feet at peak season, it’s phenomenal. At low season, it’s a big box,” Rodier says. “It’s a big building.” He says shoppers can get lost in such a big space, and that’s a turn-off. “I can put 60, 70 people on the floor and you’ll say, there’s nobody here - when we know that our customers are looking for expertise and service.” At stake is Rona’s slender lead over Home Depot in Canada. According to its own data, last year it still held the largest share of the hardware and home improvement market at 19 percent, ahead of Home Depot’s 16 percent. To be sure, the notion that the big box store is losing favor with consumer is counterintuitive, and some analysts question the logic, especially as retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc open more mega-stores in Canada. That said, the fresh emphasis on smaller stores may be smart for Rona regardless of why the chain is making the move. “It’s just a function of Canada becoming increasingly saturated,” says National Bank financial analyst Vishal Shreedhar. “You have to go into smaller markets where you need smaller stores, and sometimes you target pockets of markets, in which case you would need a smaller store.” Indeed, Shreedhar is not rejecting Rona’s plan out of hand: “Rona is trying to target niches of the market in which it believes it can perform better.” The smaller-store strategy is a big change for Rona, which kicked off its transformation from modest Quebec hardware distributor to national retailer in the 1990s to compete as Home Depot and major competitors arrived in Canada. The company was founded in 1939 by independent hardware stores in Quebec keen to ditch their powerful wholesalers, and quickly gathered more members. Many dealers were family-run businesses or small chains. Its corporate offices in Boucherville, Quebec, near Montreal are dwarfed by a nearly kilometer-long warehouse, a legacy of the company’s beginnings as a distributor. By the early 1990s, Home Depot’s orange boxes dotted the United States, and management concluded that Rona had to grow to survive. It teamed up with a group of dealers to open its first sprawling store in Laval, north of Montreal, in 1994, the year Home Depot arrived in Canada. A string of acquisitions - Cashway, Western Canada’s Revy Home Centres, Alberta’s Totem - brought in Rona’s first corporate stores, made it a national player, and took sales from C$707.1 million ($700 million) in 1997 to C$4.55 billion in 2006. The timing was right: the economy was powering ahead, and Rona’s customers were spending freely on home renovations. The stock consistently traded above C$20 from 2005 to late 2007. Then the recession hit. Rona’s sales in established stores, trending lower from the fourth quarter of 2007, rose in late 2009, thanks to a government home renovation tax credit. But same-store sales slumped again in 2010, as the tax credit expired. Home Depot and Lowe’s were, of course, also hit by the recession. Since neither company breaks out Canadian results, it is difficult to compare their recent results to Rona’s. But in its last two reported quarters, Home Depot said same-store sales rose in Canada. Home Depot has 180 locations in Canada, while Rona operates a network of nearly 800 outlets and supplies almost 1,500, most smaller than the average Home Depot. Lowe’s, which did not enter the market until 2007, had 31 stores at the beginning of April. In April, Rona’s shares jumped after the chief financial officer of Lowe’s said it was a “very interesting company,” and that Lowe’s was open to all options should Rona put itself up for sale. Since then, Rona has said repeatedly that it is not for sale. Rodier says small dealers inspired Rona’s strategic shift as the company’s research showed that customers were picking stores close to home as the recession ended. With more, smaller locations, management reasoned, Rona could reach more of them. “We took the decision to get out of the box in some markets,” he says. “We said, okay, how can we get more sales, more volume out of a market like Toronto, but differently? Less fixed costs, closer to the customer.” Rona is holding on to some big box stores, especially in Quebec. But Rodier says people are no longer willing to drive long distances or sit in traffic to get to a superstore. “In my mind, it’s the right course of action. I think instead of focusing on expansion Rona needs to focus on profitability,” says Canaccord Genuity analyst Derek Dley. While Dley does not rule out the possibility that Rona has foreseen a broader trend, he mainly connects Rona’s move out of the big box to tough competition from Home Depot and Lowe’s. “They were able to take advantage of better real estate locations than Rona was,” he says. “These guys can just pay for better spots.” Rodier disagrees. He blames the economy, not real estate or other business decisions, for sales declines. The company’s strategic plan strikes a similar note: it is called “New Realities, New Solutions”. Ed Strapagiel, executive vice president at Toronto market research firm KubasPrimedia, has not seen enough evidence to make sweeping conclusions one way or the other about big box stores. But he added: “Wal-Mart superstores are doing just fine by all accounts, and they’re building more.” ($1=$1.01 Canadian) ",7222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rona-turnaround/analysis-rona-looks-outside-the-big-box-for-a-turnaround-idUSBRE86L0LG20120722
57,LOW,BRIEF - Moody's comments on Lowe's,July 31 (Reuters) - Moody’s says Lowe’s unsolicited offer to acquire RONA is a medium term credit positive,7312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA238620120731
58,LOW,Lowe's offers to buy Canada's Rona for C$1.8 billion,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos (LOW.N), the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain, wants to spend C$1.8 billion to buy Canadian competitor Rona Inc RON.TO, but the struggling Canadian retailer publicly rejected the offer on Tuesday and said its own turnaround plan offered a better chance of success. Rona, Canada’s home-grown answer to Lowe’s and Home Depot Inc (HD.N), said the C$14.50 a share proposal was not the best deal for its shareholders. Smarting from years of disappointing sales, it wants to close some of its big box stores and focus on smaller outlets that it says its customers prefer. At stake is both Rona’s long history as an independent company deeply rooted in Quebec, and Lowe’s attempt to kickstart its Canadian expansion by acquiring hundreds of stores and a large national distribution network. Lowe’s said its plan has the support of institutional shareholders with about 15 percent of Rona’s outstanding shares. Its July 8 proposal represents a 36.7 percent premium to the stock’s closing price on Friday, July 6. North Carolina-based Lowe’s sees a deal with Rona as a way to fight Home Depot in Canada, where the domestic economy has been relatively strong, and the housing market never experienced the crash seen in the United States. Acquiring Rona would also give Lowe’s a chance to build up a presence in Rona’s home province of Quebec, where the U.S. company has no operations at all. “We are disappointed that the Rona board said no,” Doug Robinson, Lowe’s head of international operations and development, told Reuters in an interview. “We really want to take a little bit of time to consider options.” But the proposal is already facing political opposition in Quebec, where the ruling Liberals will face a tough challenge from the pro-independence Parti Quebecois in an election campaign expected to start this week. Quebec Finance Minister Raymond Bachon said the offer was not in the best interest of either Canada or Quebec and he has asked economic development agency Investissement Quebec to work out what could be done to counter the proposal. Provincial views are not a determining factor in foreign takeovers, but competition lawyers said federal officials reviewing the deal would pay heed to provincial views. “Traditionally the federal government has been very sensitive to Quebec’s needs and desires,” said one lawyer, who specializes in regulatory reviews and competition law and who asked not to be named due to possible conflicts of interest. “It seems that people pay special attention, when Quebec voices its views, especially when it is in relation to companies that are headquartered in its province.” Under the Investment Canada Act, Ottawa can review any foreign investment worth more than C$330 million and can block a deal it thinks is not in Canada’s best interests. It has exercised that prerogative only twice, most recently in 2010 when it said BHP Billiton’s (BHP.AX) hostile bid for Canadian fertilizer maker Potash Corp POT.TO was not of net benefit. Rona shares rose as high as C$14.49 before easing back to C$13.50, a gain 13.7 percent, as investors lowered their expectations of a deal being struck in the face of Quebec’s objections. Lowe’s stock was down 4.8 percent at $25.58. Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom saw little chance that Lowe’s would approach shareholders with a hostile bid. Boucherville, Quebec-based Rona has struggled as Home Depot and Lowe’s have made inroads into its home turf. Sales at Rona’s established stores, or same-store sales - a key measure for retailers - dropped 7.3 percent in the year ended December 25, 2011. Rona has blamed its weak performance on poor consumer confidence, and its recovery plan centers on closing or splitting up 23 of its 79 biggest outlets and focusing on smaller “satellite” and “proximity” stores. Rona spokeswoman Michelle Laberge said a special committee of the board had considered Lowe’s offer. “They believe that the plan that we have announced and that we are rolling out right now has greater potential to create more value in the mid- to long-term,” she said. Neither Home Depot nor Lowe’s break out Canadian results, so it hard to compare their performance to that at Rona. But in its last two reported quarters, Home Depot said same-store sales rose in Canada. Lowe’s said the two companies’ chief executives first met in July 2011, at Rona’s request, “to discuss a potential relationship.” Rona’s board rejected an earlier proposal from December 15, 2011, was rejected by Rona’s board, and Robinson said the new offer was “marginally” higher than the December one. Lowe’s operates more than 1,745 stores in North America, including 31 in Canada. Bigger rival Home Depot, which has been in Canada more than a decade longer, has 180 Canadian outlets. Rona, founded in 1939 by independent hardware stores in Quebec , operates nearly 800 locations and supplies almost 1,500 stores in Canada. Its stores are mostly smaller than Lowe’s outlets and many Rona dealers are family businesses with a long history in the network, and a stake in the public company. “I have read many comments where people said that Lowe’s would not be interested in the smaller format or the dealer businesses. That is just factually incorrect,” said Robinson. Rona’s biggest shareholder is pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which said on Tuesday it had raised its stake in the company to 14.18 percent. It said it will evaluate the offer based on the value it creates for its depositors and shareholders, but also factor in the importance of the continuing development of Rona’s Quebec supplier network. Caisse, formed nearly five decades ago by the government of Quebec to manage the funds of the Quebec pension plan, also has a mandate to contribute to the province’s economic development. Speculation about Lowe’s intentions came front and center in early April when one of its top executives told Reuters that Rona was a “very interesting company. Rona insisted it was not for sale.

59,LOW,UPDATE 7-Lowe's offers to buy Canada's Rona for C$1.8 bln,"* Lowe’s offers C$14.50/shr for Canada home improvement chain * Rona rejects offer, focuses on own turnaround plan * Quebec government says deal not in Quebec, Canada interest * Rona shares rise about 14 pct, Lowe’s down 5 pct By Euan Rocha and Dhanya Skariachan July 31 (Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos, the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain, wants to spend C$1.8 billion to buy Canadian competitor Rona Inc, but the struggling Canadian retailer publicly rejected the offer on Tuesday and said its own turnaround plan offered a better chance of success. Rona, Canada’s home-grown answer to Lowe’s and Home Depot Inc, said the C$14.50 a share proposal was not the best deal for its shareholders. Smarting from years of disappointing sales, it wants to close some of its big box stores and focus on smaller outlets that it says its customers prefer. At stake is both Rona’s long history as an independent company deeply rooted in Quebec, and Lowe’s attempt to kickstart its Canadian expansion by acquiring hundreds of stores and a large national distribution network. Lowe’s said its plan has the support of institutional shareholders with about 15 percent of Rona’s outstanding shares. Its July 8 proposal represents a 36.7 percent premium to the stock’s closing price on Friday, July 6. North Carolina-based Lowe’s sees a deal with Rona as a way to fight Home Depot in Canada, where the domestic economy has been relatively strong, and the housing market never experienced the crash seen in the United States. Acquiring Rona would also give Lowe’s a chance to build up a presence in Rona’s home province of Quebec, where the U.S. company has no operations at all. “We are disappointed that the Rona board said no,” Doug Robinson, Lowe’s head of international operations and development, told Reuters in an interview. “We really want to take a little bit of time to consider options.” But the proposal is already facing political opposition in Quebec, where the ruling Liberals will face a tough challenge from the pro-independence Parti Quebecois in an election campaign expected to start this week.

60,LOW,Lowe's offers to buy Canada's Rona for C$1.8 billion,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain, has offered to buy Rona Inc RON.TO for C$1.8 billion ($1.8 billion), but the struggling Canadian retailer said its own turnaround plan offered a better chance of success. Rona, Canada’s home-grown answer to Lowe’s and Home Depot Inc (HD.N), said the C$14.50 a share proposal was not the best deal for its shareholders. Smarting from years of disappointing sales, it wants to close some of its big box stores and focus on smaller outlets that it says its customers prefer. The government of Quebec, Rona’s home province, said the offer was not in the best interest of either Canada or Quebec and that it would examine how best to counter the proposal. Lowe’s said its plan has the support of institutional shareholders with about 15 percent of Rona’s outstanding shares. Its July 8 proposal represents a 36.7 percent premium to the stock’s closing price on Friday, July 6. “We are disappointed that the Rona board said no,” Doug Robinson, Lowe’s head of international operations and development, told Reuters in an interview. “We really want to take a little bit of time to consider options.” At stake is both Rona’s long history as an independent company deeply rooted in Quebec, and Lowe’s attempt to kickstart its Canadian expansion by acquiring hundreds of stores and a national distribution network. Rona’s shares were up 18.9 percent at C$14.11 on Tuesday. Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom saw little chance Lowe’s, based in North Carolina, would go ahead with a hostile bid straight to shareholders. “They are seeking the approval of the board,” he said. “This could take a little while, before both parties get comfortable with each other, the way that they operate and also the ultimate price tag.” Boucherville, Quebec-based Rona has struggled as Home Depot and Lowe’s have made inroads into its home turf. Sales at Rona’s established stores, or same-store sales - a key measure for retailers - dropped 7.3 percent in the year ended December 25, 2011. Rona blames its weak performance on poor consumer confidence. Since Home Depot nor Lowe’s break out Canadian results, it is difficult to compare them to Rona, but in its last two reported quarters, Home Depot said same-store sales rose in Canada. Under a strategic plan announced in February, Rona is closing or splitting up 23 of its 79 biggest outlets and opening smaller “satellite” and “proximity” stores. Rona spokeswoman Michelle Laberge said a special committee of the board had considered Lowe’s offer. “They believe that the plan that we have announced and that we are rolling out right now has greater potential to create more value in the mid- to long-term,” she said Lowe’s said the two companies’ chief executives first met in July 2011, at Rona’s request, “to discuss a potential relationship.” It said an earlier proposal to acquire Rona, dated December 15, 2011, was rejected by Rona’s board. Robinson said the new proposal was “marginally” higher than the December one. Lowe’s operates more than 1,745 stores in North America, including 31 in Canada. Bigger rival Home Depot, which has been in Canada more than a decade longer, has 180 Canadian outlets. Rona, founded in 1939 by independent hardware stores in Quebec keen to ditch their powerful wholesalers, operates nearly 800 locations and supplies almost 1,500 stores in Canada, most of them smaller than Lowe’s big-box stores. Many Rona dealers are family businesses with a long history in the network, and a stake in the public company. Lowe’s said in a statement that it would be committed to preserving Rona’s diverse formats. “I have read many comments where people said that Lowe’s would not be interested in the smaller format or the dealer businesses (of Rona). That is just factually incorrect,” said Robinson. Quebec finance minister Raymond Bachand said in a statement he had asked economic development agency Investissement Quebec work out what could be done to counter Lowe’s offer, including “setting up a fund to defend Quebec’s interests.” “In due time, we look forward to the opportunity to meet with the government to address any questions or concerns they may have,” Lowe’s said in a statement. Pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec said it will evaluate the offer based on the value it creates for its depositors and shareholders, but also factor in the importance of the continuing development of Rona’s Quebec supplier network. The Caisse held 12.18 percent of Rona’s outstanding shares on June 28, according to Thomson Reuters data. Caisse, formed nearly five decades ago by the government of Quebec to manage the funds of the Quebec pension plan, also has a mandate to contribute to the province’s economic development. Lowe’s said it would keep Rona’s Canadian head office in Boucherville, just outside Montreal. The proposed deal would need approval from Canada’s federal industry ministry, as is the case for any large foreign takeover. Speculation about Lowe’s intentions came front and center in early April when one of the U.S.-based chain’s top executives told Reuters that Rona was a “very interesting company. Rona insisted it was not for sale. But even before Tuesday’s news, the stock had risen 12 percent in three months, partly on hopes that Lowe’s might bid. Rona has both common shares and preferred shares, but holders of preferred shares are not entitled to vote at its shareholder meetings. Scotiabank and BMO Capital Markets are acting as Rona’s financial advisors, with Norton Rose Canada LLP and Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg acting as its legal advisors.

Its July 8 proposal represents a 36.7 percent premium to the stock’s closing price on Friday, July 6. North Carolina-based Lowe’s sees a deal with Rona as a way to fight Home Depot in Canada, where the domestic economy has been relatively strong, and the housing market never experienced the crash seen in the United States. Acquiring Rona would also give Lowe’s a chance to build up a presence in Rona’s home province of Quebec, where the U.S. company has no operations at all. “We are disappointed that the Rona board said no,” Doug Robinson, Lowe’s head of international operations and development, told Reuters in an interview. “We really want to take a little bit of time to consider options.” But the proposal is already facing political opposition in Quebec, where the ruling Liberals will face a tough challenge from the pro-independence Parti Quebecois in an election campaign expected to start this week. Quebec Finance Minister Raymond Bachand said the offer was not in the best interest of either Canada or Quebec and he has asked economic development agency Investissement Quebec to work out what could be done to counter the proposal. Provincial views are not a determining factor in foreign takeovers, but competition lawyers said federal officials reviewing the deal would pay heed to provincial views. “Traditionally the federal government has been very sensitive to Quebec’s needs and desires,” said one lawyer, who specializes in regulatory reviews and competition law and who asked not to be named due to possible conflicts of interest. “It seems that people pay special attention, when Quebec voices its views, especially when it is in relation to companies that are headquartered in its province.” Under the Investment Canada Act, Ottawa can review any foreign investment worth more than C$330 million and can block a deal it thinks is not in Canada’s best interests. It has exercised that prerogative only twice, most recently in 2010 when it said BHP Billiton’s (BHP.AX) hostile bid for Canadian fertilizer maker Potash Corp POT.TO was not of net benefit. Rona shares rose as high as C$14.49 before easing back to C$13.50, a gain 13.7 percent, as investors lowered their expectations of a deal being struck in the face of Quebec’s objections. Lowe’s stock was down 4.8 percent at $25.58. Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom saw little chance that Lowe’s would approach shareholders with a hostile bid. Boucherville, Quebec-based Rona has struggled as Home Depot and Lowe’s have made inroads into its home turf. Sales at Rona’s established stores, or same-store sales - a key measure for retailers - dropped 7.3 percent in the year ended December 25, 2011. Rona has blamed its weak performance on poor consumer confidence, and its recovery plan centers on closing or splitting up 23 of its 79 biggest outlets and focusing on smaller “satellite” and “proximity” stores. Rona spokeswoman Michelle Laberge said a special committee of the board had considered Lowe’s offer. “They believe that the plan that we have announced and that we are rolling out right now has greater potential to create more value in the mid- to long-term,” she said. Neither Home Depot nor Lowe’s break out Canadian results, so it hard to compare their performance to that at Rona. But in its last two reported quarters, Home Depot said same-store sales rose in Canada. Lowe’s said the two companies’ chief executives first met in July 2011, at Rona’s request, “to discuss a potential relationship.” Rona’s board rejected an earlier proposal from December 15, 2011, was rejected by Rona’s board, and Robinson said the new offer was “marginally” higher than the December one. Lowe’s operates more than 1,745 stores in North America, including 31 in Canada. Bigger rival Home Depot, which has been in Canada more than a decade longer, has 180 Canadian outlets. Rona, founded in 1939 by independent hardware stores in Quebec , operates nearly 800 locations and supplies almost 1,500 stores in Canada. Its stores are mostly smaller than Lowe’s outlets and many Rona dealers are family businesses with a long history in the network, and a stake in the public company. “I have read many comments where people said that Lowe’s would not be interested in the smaller format or the dealer businesses. That is just factually incorrect,” said Robinson. Rona’s biggest shareholder is pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which said on Tuesday it had raised its stake in the company to 14.18 percent. It said it will evaluate the offer based on the value it creates for its depositors and shareholders, but also factor in the importance of the continuing development of Rona’s Quebec supplier network. Caisse, formed nearly five decades ago by the government of Quebec to manage the funds of the Quebec pension plan, also has a mandate to contribute to the province’s economic development. Speculation about Lowe’s intentions came front and center in early April when one of its top executives told Reuters that Rona was a “very interesting company. Rona insisted it was not for sale. But even before Tuesday’s news, the stock had risen 12 percent in three months, partly on hopes that Lowe’s might bid. Scotiabank and BMO Capital Markets are acting as Rona’s financial advisors, with Norton Rose Canada LLP and Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg acting as its legal advisors. Lowe’s financial advisors are CIBC World Markets and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Stikeman Elliott and Hunton & Williams are acting as its legal advisors.

67,LOW,"Analysis: In Rona bid, Lowe's learns meaning of ""faux pas""","TORONTO (Reuters) - A proposal by Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain, to buy Canada’s Rona Inc RON.TO for C$1.8 billion ($1.8 billion) has come at an inopportune moment. The offer, rejected by the do-it-yourself retailer, is raising hackles in Rona’s home province of Quebec, where the ruling Liberals face a tough challenge from the pro-independence Parti Quebecois in an election campaign that began this week. Both parties have come out against the proposal. Half of Rona’s 30,000 employees are based in French-speaking Quebec, and the Liberal finance minister, Raymond Bachand, says a sale would not be in the best interests of either Quebec or Canada. “It strikes me on first blush as really bad planning on the part of Lowe’s. If there is one thing we’ve learned, it is never try and get Investment Canada approval during an election. They couldn’t have planned this worse,” said one Canadian lawyer, who specializes in competition law and regulatory reviews. The Investment Canada Act requires Ottawa to review foreign investments worth more than C$330 million and gives it the power to block a deal that is not in the country’s best interests. That has happened only twice, most recently in 2010, just months ahead of federal elections, when the government foiled BHP Billiton’s (BHP.AX) C$39 billion hostile bid for fertilizer maker Potash Corp POT.TO. Strong opposition from Potash Corp’s home province of Saskatchewan was a big factor in that decision. The lawyer, who is not involved in the deal but who asked to go unnamed to protect business relationships, said an acrimonious history between Canada and Quebec complicates matters for Ottawa. “The way Canada is set up, great deference is paid to Quebec and Quebec’s interests. If the province really wants to put its foot down and reject this deal, Ottawa is going to be very, very hesitant to go against the wishes of Quebec, because it would just create an uproar,” he said. Lowe’s said it is happy to discuss any of Quebec’s concerns. “In due time, we look forward to the opportunity to meet with the government to address any questions or concerns they may have,” Lowe’s spokeswoman Chris Ahearn said by email. Lowe’s on Thursday launched a website outlining its proposal (www.lowes.ca/ronaproposal). The site encourages Rona’s dealers to get in touch, but it is only available in English, an unusual choice for a province where the use of the French language is a sensitive and politicized issue. Rona shares rose as high as C$14.49 on Tuesday after Lowe’s C$14.50-a-share proposal was made public, but shares pared gains as investors lowered expectations in the face of Quebec’s objections. The shares were at C$13.91 at noon on Thursday. Norman Levine, a fund manager whose firm sold roughly half its stake in Rona after news of the bid emerged on Tuesday, said it was “pretty naive” of Lowe’s and its management team to not see that the bid would become a political issue. Levine, the managing director of Portfolio Management Corp, sees chances of Lowe’s succeeding at about 50-50, but he warns that Rona’s shares could easily sink back to around C$10 a share if the odds of a deal fade away. “I think that the Quebec government is way overplaying their hand,” he said. “These are stores, they’re not nuclear reactors. They (Lowe’s) are not up and taking them out of the province.” Provincial views are not a determining factor in foreign takeovers, but most competition lawyers agree that federal officials reviewing the deal would be loathe to ignore Quebec’s views on the subject. “I think this is purely political posturing in Quebec,” said another competition law expert, who also asked not to be named for similar reasons. “But it is important posturing nonetheless, when you have an election and you have an opposition party that would be all over the government if they were supportive of the Lowe’s move or not complaining about it.” To be sure, political objections could become moot, if Lowe’s bumps up its offer and Rona accepts a higher price. Rona operates nearly 800 stores across Canada, including 316 in Quebec. Lowe’s has 31 in Canada, none of them in Quebec. Most U.S. retailers launch their Canadian operations within English-speaking Canada, given the challenges of operating in Quebec, which has a distinct culture. U.S. brands are also less well-known in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada. Even Canadian companies from outside Quebec have faced obstacles. A decade ago, the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec - Rona’s largest shareholder - blocked Rogers Communications Inc’s (RCIb.TO) friendly bid for Quebec-based cable company Videotron and backed a hostile bid from Montreal’s Quebecor Inc (QBRa.TO) instead. Caisse, which has a dual mandate of managing the Quebec pension plan and contributing to economic development, said on Tuesday it had boosted its stake in Rona to 14.2 percent, from about 12 percent. It promised to examine the impact of Lowe’s proposal on its own returns, on Rona’s suppliers and on the Quebec economy. Lowe’s has promised to keep Rona’s headquarters in Quebec after a deal and it expects the number of people Rona employs in Quebec and the rest of Canada to rise or stay the same. But the promises may not be enough to appease critics, who have seen thousands lose their jobs after big takeovers. The United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents nearly 3,000 Rona workers in Quebec, said it was concerned by the Lowe’s proposal and the U.S. retailer’s failure to engage with the union so far. “I have to admit we are a little worried,” said Antonio Filato, president of Local 500, which represents some of the Rona workers in Quebec. Filato said the union would be open to talks with Lowe’s if a deal gets done, but Lowe’s must be ready to deal with unions and to realize that operating in Quebec is different. “If they think it’s going to be like being in the States, it won’t be like that in Quebec.” ",8022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rona-lowes/analysis-in-rona-bid-lowes-learns-meaning-of-faux-pas-idUSBRE8711DK20120802

Rona, Canada’s home-grown answer to Lowe’s and Home Depot Inc, said the C$14.50 a share proposal was not the best deal for its shareholders. Smarting from years of disappointing sales, it wants to close some of its big box stores and focus on smaller outlets that it says its customers prefer. At stake is both Rona’s long history as an independent company deeply rooted in Quebec, and Lowe’s attempt to kickstart its Canadian expansion by acquiring hundreds of stores and a large national distribution network.

69,LOW,UPDATE 3-Takeover target Rona's earnings rise with sales,"* Q2 adj EPS C$0.36 vs C$0.28 year earlier * Revenue up 3.4 pct at C$1.42 billion * On revised basis, same-store sales rose Aug 8 (Reuters) - Canada’s Rona Inc, which has rejected a C$1.8 billion takeover proposal from U.S. home-improvement retailer Lowe’s Cos Inc, said on Wednesday its quarterly adjusted earnings rose along with higher sales volumes. The results come as investors try to gauge the chances of Rona - which says it is No. 1 in Canada’s hardware and home improvement market - succumbing to a Lowe’s takeover. Rona has said repeatedly that it is not for sale, and the government of the province of Quebec, where it is based, wasted no time criticizing Lowe’s proposed offer when it was announced last week. Rona’s stock touched C$14.49 shortly after the news of the C$14.50-a-share offer broke, but since then the stock has consistently traded below that level. Shares rose 1.0 percent to C$13.88 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning. On Wednesday’s quarterly results conference call with analysts and investors, Rona said it would not discuss the Lowe’s proposal. In the second quarter, Rona’s distribution sales rose 8.7 percent and retail and commercial sales were 1.8 percent higher. “We view the results as mixed,” said National Bank Financial analyst Vishal Shreedhar in a note to clients. “Q2 financial results were slightly below expectation; however, management is making progress towards its financial priorities.” Beginning with the quarter, Rona changed the way it measures same-store sales, a yardstick generally designed to strip out gains from opening new outlets. Rona had reported seven consecutive quarters of same-store sales declines before the revision. For the first time the company is including distribution sales to affiliate dealers, and on that basis same-store sales rose 1 percent in the quarter. In Rona’s retail and commercial business alone, same-store sales fell 0.9 percent. The company attributed the decline to cautious consumers and the mix of products sold. When it last reported earnings in May, Rona said same-store sales - which at that point did not include sales to dealers - had been positive late in the first quarter, and through April. But the trend did not continue. “Starting at the end of May, we saw a slowdown,” Chief Financial Officer Dominique Boies said on the conference call. “We saw, I would say, somewhat of a rapid slowdown in same-store sales, where consumers became, again, very unstable.” The company said its earnings benefited from lower financial costs, amortization and depreciation, and efficiency measures put in place during the quarter. Net earnings attributable to participating shares after a dividend on preferred shares fell to C$34.1 million ($34.2 million), or 28 Canadian cents a share, compared with C$37.0 million, or 28 Canadian cents, a year earlier. Excluding unusual items, earnings rose to C$43.6 million, or 36 Canadian cents a share, from C$37.0 million, or 28 Canadian cents. Revenue rose 3.4 percent to C$1.42 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 37 Canadian cents a share on revenue of C$1.41 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Quebec’s government has sharply criticized the Lowe’s proposal, saying it is not in the interests of Quebec or Canada. Rona’s figures put its national market share ahead of that of U.S. industry giant Home Depot Inc. The company, founded in Quebec in 1939 by independent hardware stores keen to ditch their powerful wholesalers, has deep roots in the French-speaking province, still home to about half of its 30,000 employees. Rona argues that its own turnaround plan is a better deal for shareholders than Lowe’s proposal. The company is refocusing on smaller stores that it says customers prefer, closing 10 of its biggest outlets and splitting up 13 others by the end of 2013. In their place, it is opening smaller “proximity” and “satellite” stores. On Wednesday, Rona said it still expects the new strategy, announced early this year, to boost earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by C$10 million in 2012. The first of the new proximity stores opens in Edmonton, Alberta, on Wednesday.

70,LOW,"UPDATE 1-Quebec separatists take lead, promise to fight takeovers","* Polls show separatists on course to win election * Separatists need majority to hold independence referendum * Promise protection against foreign takeover bids By David Ljunggren Aug 10 (Reuters) - A Quebec separatist party that is promising to fight foreign takeovers of firms based in the Canadian province is in the lead for the Sept. 4 elections, two new polls showed on Friday. The Parti Quebecois, which wants Quebec to break away from the rest of Canada, promises it will do more to combat takeover bids such the attempt by U.S. home-improvement retailer Lowe’s Cos Inc to buy Rona Inc. Lowe’s has not put in a formal bid for Quebec-based Rona, but Rona said last month that it had rejected a C$1.8 billion ($1.8 billion) proposal. A CROP poll for La Presse put support for the Parti Quebecois at 32 percent in next months provincial elections, compared with 29 percent for the governing Liberals. The new, untested and right-leaning Coalition for the Future of Quebec (CAQ) was at 21 percent. CROP said those figures meant a majority government might be within reach for the Parti Quebecois. If the party does win a majority of seats in the provincial legislature it could introduce a referendum on independence, which would be needed before Quebec could split from Canada. A separate Leger poll for Le Devoir put support for the Parti Quebecois at 32 percent, the Liberals at 31 percent and the CAQ on 27 percent. The Parti Quebecois outlined its proposals on foreign takeovers and on a bigger pro-Quebec role for the provincial pension plan, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, after the two opinion polls were conducted. Although the federal government has jurisdiction over foreign takeovers, the Parti Quebecois said the province could be doing more to protect home-grown industries. PQ leader Pauline Marois, who says Quebecers are fed up with the Liberals’ almost 10-year spell in government, said she would change the role of the Caisse and give it a C$10 billion fighting fund to help fend off takeovers and stimulate business growth in Quebec. “Today the headquarters and property of Rona are threatened. We have to act with force ... we can re-establish control over our development and remain masters of our own fate,” she said on Thursday. Marois also said firms that had received takeover bids would have to consider the interests of the workers. “Too many firms have closed their doors in recent years, leaving hundreds of workers out on the street and communities devitalized. This has to stop,” she said. Quebec Finance Minister Raymond Bachand said this month the Lowe’s offer was not in the best interest of either Canada or Quebec and asked economic development agency Investissement Quebec to work out what could be done to counter the proposal. The CAQ, which says it wants more rights for Quebec but is not pressing for independence, has yet to reveal an economic platform. The party could play an important role in the election if it starts eating into support for the Liberals and the PQ. Other factors to bear in mind are that Liberal Premier Jean Charest is an experienced campaigner and the first of what could be four crucial televised leaders’ debates will not be until Aug 19. CROP said 26 percent of Quebecers thought Charest would be the best prime minister, compared to 25 percent who chose Marois and 22 percent who opted for CAQ leader Francois Legault. The CROP telephone poll of 1,061 adults was conducted between Aug. 4 and 8 and is considered accurate to within 3.0 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The Leger Internet poll of 1,589 adults was carried out between Aug 6 and 8 and is considered accurate to within 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

72,LOW,"Lowe's misses estimates, lags Home Depot","(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and earnings and cut its profit outlook for the year as the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain lost market share to larger rival Home Depot. The results on Monday came just days after Home Depot Inc (HD.N) beat Wall Street profit estimates with the help of cost controls and market share gains, and raised its earnings forecast. Shares of Lowe’s fell 5.3 percent to $26.40 in morning trading, while Home Depot dipped 1 percent to $56.17. “Lowe’s is a turnaround story, and it’s not turning,” said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co analyst Colin McGranahan. The company has cut jobs, curbed store expansion plans and streamlined its supply chain to cut costs and compete more effectively, but it has yet to see results. It recently decided to provide fewer discounts on expensive items like appliances, in sync with its bigger plan to offer “everyday low prices” rather than promotions. The move has driven some shoppers away. “The team is making progress on these initiatives but, frankly, the benefits are accruing at a slower rate than I had expected,” Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call with analysts. “It will likely be mid-2013 before we fully complete this phase of our transformation.” Analysts said other efforts, such as a credit card discount program, had hurt margins more than they had helped sales. “The biggest disappointment was the margins,” McGranahan said. “They lowered some prices, they offered a 5 percent discount on their credit cards, and it doesn’t look like they got any traction yet.” Gross margin fell to 33.9 percent in the latest quarter from 34.5 percent a year earlier. Sales suffered in the traditionally strong second quarter, which ended on August 3, as unseasonably warm weather early in the year pulled some demand into the first quarter. Sales at Lowe’s stores open at least a year fell 0.4 percent, including a 0.2 percent decrease for the U.S. business, the 13th straight quarter that the company trailed Home Depot in same-store sales. “Lowe’s inability to drive sales despite discounting remains a concern,” Janney analyst David Strasser said in a research note. Net earnings fell to $747 million, or 64 cents a share, from $830 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected 70 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 2 percent to $14.25 billion, while analysts had expected $14.46 billion. Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe’s, which has stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico, now expects flat sales for the fiscal year ending February 1.

73,LOW,"UPDATE 4-Lowe's misses estimates, lags Home Depot","* Quarterly earnings 64 cents a share; analysts’ view 70 cents * Sales fall 2 percent to $14.25 billion, missing estimates * Lowe’s cuts full-year earnings view * Shares down 5.3 percent   (Adds comments from conference call, updates share movement) By Dhanya Skariachan and Nivedita Bhattacharjee Aug 20 (Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and earnings and cut its profit outlook for the year as the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain lost market share to larger rival Home Depot. The results on Monday came just days after Home Depot Inc  beat Wall Street profit estimates with the help of cost controls and market share gains, and raised its earnings forecast. Shares of Lowe’s fell 5.3 percent to $26.40 in morning trading, while Home Depot dipped 1 percent to $56.17. “Lowe’s is a turnaround story, and it’s not turning,” said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co analyst Colin McGranahan. The company has cut jobs, curbed store expansion plans and streamlined its supply chain to cut costs and compete more effectively, but it has yet to see results. It recently decided to provide fewer discounts on expensive items like appliances, in sync with its bigger plan to offer “everyday low prices” rather than promotions. The move has driven some shoppers away. “The team is making progress on these initiatives but, frankly, the benefits are accruing at a slower rate than I had expected,” Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call with analysts. “It will likely be mid-2013 before we fully complete this phase of our transformation.” Analysts said other efforts, such as a credit card discount program, had hurt margins more than they had helped sales. “The biggest disappointment was the margins,” McGranahan said. “They lowered some prices, they offered a 5 percent discount on their credit cards, and it doesn’t look like they got any traction yet.” Gross margin fell to 33.9 percent in the latest quarter from 34.5 percent a year earlier. Sales suffered in the traditionally strong second quarter, which ended on Aug. 3, as unseasonably warm weather early in the year pulled some demand into the first quarter. Sales at Lowe’s stores open at least a year fell 0.4 percent, including a 0.2 percent decrease for the U.S. business, the 13th straight quarter that the company trailed Home Depot in same-store sales. “Lowe’s inability to drive sales despite discounting remains a concern,” Janney analyst David Strasser said in a research note. Net earnings fell to $747 million, or 64 cents a share, from $830 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected 70 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 2 percent to $14.25 billion, while analysts had expected $14.46 billion. Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe’s, which has stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico, now expects flat sales for the fiscal year ending Feb. 1.

75,LOW,Rona dealers criticize Lowe's takeover offer,"(Reuters) - A group of Rona Inc RON.TO on Wednesday criticized Lowe’s Cos Inc’s (LOW.N) proposed takeover of the Canadian home-improvement retailer and distributor, saying the U.S.-based company business model is incompatible with theirs. In an open letter addressed to Lowe’s Chief Executive Robert Niblock, merchants that operate 164 of nearly 400 affiliate or franchise Rona stores praised the company’s management. “Being independent, we have options, and that’s why we sent the letter,” said Michael Allen, whose family owns a 57,000-square-foot Rona store in Vancouver, British Columbia. “We’re not tied to Lowe’s. If Lowe’s buys Rona, we can go be an independent somewhere else, with another brand, if we choose.” Niblock said on Monday that Lowe’s was evaluating its options, and a deal was “not imminent.” Shares closed at their lowest since Lowe’s made its C$1.8 billion takeover proposal public at the end of July. The stock slid further on Tuesday and Wednesday, and was down 4.6 percent at C$12.52 by Wednesday afternoon. Earlier, data showed Canada’s retail sales dropped unexpectedly in June, and the broader stock market was lower. Allen, 29, runs a store opened by his father in 1987. He said the outlet employs 85 people and clears about C$10 million ($10.1 million) in sales every year. The business joined Rona in 2005, leaving Home Hardware, a competing hardware cooperative. While Rona’s complex, differentiated network bears little resemblance to the uniform big-box stores that Lowe’s already operates in North America, Lowe’s has said it would continue to work with dealers. If they leave in large numbers, Rona could be a less valuable asset. Dealers sign long-term agreements with Rona, but management said on a recent conference call that a significant number of contracts come up in 2012, because of a cycle kicked off by the company’s IPO. “We want to reinforce your view that it may not be a good idea for you to buy Rona, after you appeared to state your doubts about the deal on Monday, while you were announcing your financial results,” said the letter. Rona has said repeatedly that it is not for sale, and its stock has consistently traded below Lowe’s proposed C$14.50 a share offer. The proposal has become an election issue in Rona’s home province of Quebec, with both the governing Liberal party and challenger Parti Quebecois criticizing the offer and promising new rules to crack down on foreign takeovers. Dealers own about 10 percent of Rona’s shares, the company has said, and in recent quarters dealer outlets have performed better than their corporate counterparts. “We have signed long-term agreements with Rona based on the company’s unique business model, which values the co-existence of big-box outlets and neighborhood stores, with the diverse needs and values of our customers front of mind,” said the letter.

80,LOW,"UPDATE 2-Rona profit drops, says 'progress interrupted'","* Adj earnings C$0.27/shr vs C$0.36/shr a year earlier * Revenue down 0.8 percent at C$1.34 billion * Rona says difficult market weighs on results   (Adds same-store sales, background, quote from CEO) Nov 7 (Reuters) - Canadian home improvement retailer and distributor Rona Inc reported a drop in quarterly profit on Wednesday after cutting prices to limit sales declines in a tough market. Rona, whose shares fell sharply in early trading, launched a turnaround plan earlier this year and also refused a takeover by U.S.-based competitor Lowe’s Cos Inc. It said in its results release that its turnaround plan would proceed. “Rona saw its progress interrupted in a quarter marked by a decline in the Canadian hardware-renovation industry as a whole,” the Boucherville, Quebec-based company said. “The drop in sales, coupled with more intense competition, put pressure on gross margins.” Sales at established stores fell 1 percent, pulled down by retail operations, where same-store sales were 1.8 percent lower. Distribution sales rose on a same-store basis. Lowe’s takeover proposal, which never made it to the formal offer stage, became a hot-button issue during this year’s provincial election in Quebec, where Rona has deep roots. Politicians from both the incumbent Liberal Party and the election’s eventual winner, the Parti Quebecois, both opposed the plan. Rona was founded in Quebec in 1939 by independent hardware stores keen to ditch their powerful wholesalers. The French-speaking province is still home to about half of its 30,000 employees. In its turnaround plan, the company is refocusing on smaller outlets that it says customers prefer, and it said earlier this year that it would close 10 of its biggest outlets and split up 13 others by the end of 2013. In their place, it is opening smaller “proximity” and “satellite” stores. But on Wednesday Rona said it had postponed the closing of five big-box stores to better coordinate with the new openings, and reduce the financial impact of the move. “The new store formats are generating very promising results in line with the favorable trend observed in recent quarters for smaller stores, in spite of challenging market conditions,” said Chief Executive Robert Dutton in the release. “I’m certain that we are one step ahead of our competitors in this period of great change in our industry.” Net income fell to C$5.1 million ($5.1 million), or 4 Canadian cents a share, from C$47.8 million, or 36 Canadian cents, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, profit was C$33.1 million, or 27 Canadian cents a share. Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 40 Canadian cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Rona said revenue fell 0.8 percent to C$1.34 billion, compared with the consensus forecast of C$1.36 billion. Rona’s stock was down 5 percent at C$9.64 in early trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

81,LOW,UPDATE 3-CEO of Canada's Rona steps down; shares jump,"* Lowe’s withdrew takeover proposal in September * Lowe’s says no recent talks with Rona * Robert Dutton has been chief executive since 1992 * CFO Boies to be interim chief executive * Rona shares jump more than 7 percent   (Recasts with surprise after disappointing results, adds investor comments, updates share price move) By Allison Martell and Euan Rocha TORONTO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Canadian home-improvement retailer and distributor Rona Inc, which earlier this year rejected a takeover offer from U.S.-based rival Lowe’s Cos Inc, said on Friday that Chief Executive Robert Dutton was stepping down, a surprise move that came two days after disappointing results. Rona said Chief Financial Officer Dominique Boies would serve as acting CEO while the company looks for a successor. Rona shares jumped amid speculation that the Quebec-based company might be in play. Fund manager Irwin Michael, whose I.A. Michael Investment Counsel Ltd is one of Rona’s top shareholders, said Dutton’s “completely unexpected” departure gives the company a chance to rethink its plans. “The fact is, Rona needs change,” he said. “They have got to be open to a number of things. They have to consider shareholders as well - the stock has done very, very poorly along with the very poor results.” In an unusual strategy for hardware stores, where big has long seemed beautiful, Rona has put a shift away from big box stores at the center of its turnaround strategy. It is opening more “satellite” and “proximity” outlets that run 5,000 to 35,000 square feet, rather than the 100,000 square feet-plus found at most big boxes. Lowe’s spokeswoman Chris Ahearn said there had not been any recent talks with Rona. “Since we withdrew our proposal to work with the Rona board, there have been no further discussions,” she said. Acting chief executive Boies joined Rona in 2011, after five years with the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Rona’s top shareholder. The Caisse, which has a dual mandate of managing the Quebec pension plan and contributing to economic development, boosted its stake after Rona made the Lowe’s proposal public. Caisse owns over 15 percent of Rona’s outstanding shares, according to the latest Thomson Reuters data. Shares of Rona were up 7.9 percent at C$10.09 on Friday afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange, off an intraday high of C$10.25. The broader market was little changed. Canaccord Genuity analyst Derek Dley said traders were probably covering short positions, given the chance that a new CEO might improve Rona’s performance, and speculation that Dutton’s departure could clear the way for a sale. “A lot of investors had been looking for a change-up at the top with Rona for quite some time,” he said. “They have lagged the market.” But Dley said he still did not think a deal for Rona was likely: “At the end of the day, that was a board decision, not just the CEO’s decision.” Michael warned that an extended search for a successor could further erode Rona’s market share and value. Rona, which reported a surprise drop in quarterly profit on Wednesday, did not say why Dutton was leaving. Dutton joined the company in 1977, became chief executive in 1992, and oversaw much of Rona’s transformation from modest Quebec hardware distributor to nation-wide retailer. During Dutton’s tenure, annual sales skyrocketed from C$450 million to more than C$4.8 billion. But sales at established stores have dropped in several recent quarters. Lowe’s withdrew its C$1.8 billion proposal, which never made it to formal-offer stage, amid opposition from Rona, politicians in the retailer’s home province of Quebec and a large group of Rona’s independent dealers. Under the new strategy, Rona initially planned to shut 10 of its biggest stores and split up 13 others by the end of 2013. But on Wednesday, Rona postponed the closing of five big-box stores to better coordinate with the new openings and to cushion the financial impact of the move to smaller stores.

84,LOW,UPDATE 4-Major Rona shareholder Invesco seeks to replace board,"* Call for shareholder meeting intensifies takeover talk * Invesco move follows resignation of longtime Rona CEO * Invesco controls 10.16 pct of home improvement chain * Lowe’s withdrew proposed offer for Rona in September * Rona shares rise 4.8 pct on Toronto Stock Exchange   (Adds comments from investor, Caisse) By Allison Martell Nov 14 (Reuters) - Invesco Canada Ltd, one of the largest investors in Rona Inc, called for the removal of the company’s board on Wednesday, reviving speculation that the Canadian home improvement chain was ripe for a takeover bid. Rona’s stock rose nearly 5 percent after Invesco said it would request a shareholder meeting for a vote on replacing the current directors of the retailer and distributor. The move could pit Invesco, with about 10.16 percent of Rona’s outstanding shares, against the company’s current board, a number of its independent dealers, and even the government in its home province of Quebec. U.S.-based rival Lowe’s Cos Inc withdrew a C$1.8 billion ($1.8 billion) proposal to buy Rona in mid-September in the face of stiff opposition. But Rona’s longtime chief executive, Robert Dutton, stepped down on Friday following disappointing results, prompting speculation that the company could be in play. Norman Levine, managing director at Toronto investment firm Portfolio Management Corp, said Invesco’s move against the board was long overdue. “For the last five years they’ve had negative same-store sales, profit has gone nowhere and the stock has sunk. There’s been nothing to be happy about as a shareholder of Rona, and yet the board supported Robert Dutton all along,” he said. Levine, whose firm has a small stake in Rona, would like to see a new board return to the table with Lowe’s and negotiate a friendly deal. “This is a deal that makes sense for both sides,” he said. “Lowe’s needs Rona to extend across the country ... Rona needs a new direction, needs somebody in there to help them, and Lowe’s can provide that expertise.” Canaccord Genuity analyst Derek Dley said he was not surprised by Invesco’s announcement, given how much has changed over the course of a week. “It’s interesting - it’s going to fuel increased speculation that there may be a transaction down the road,” he said. On Wednesday morning, Boucherville, Quebec-based Rona had no immediate comment. Rona was much discussed during Quebec’s autumn provincial election, with both the incumbent Liberal Party and the eventual winner, the Parti Quebecois, opposed to a takeover. Rona’s biggest shareholder is Quebec pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which controls just over 15 percent of the firm, according to Thomson Reuters data. One key question is how the fund would respond to a bid for Rona. Spokesman Maxime Chagnon said the Caisse never discusses its investment strategy in advance, and he had no specific comment on Invesco, but he did speak generally about the company. “We recognize Mr. Dutton’s work, his contribution to Rona over the last 35 years, and we fully respect the decision, but now ... we believe Rona must look to the future and focus all of its energy on improving performance,” he said. “The results announced last week reinforced the importance of Rona improving performance.” Rona’s acting chief executive, Dominique Boies, joined Rona in 2011 after five years with the Caisse. The fund, which has a dual mandate of managing the Quebec pension plan and contributing to economic development, boosted its stake in Rona after Lowe’s made its proposal. In September, Quebec’s new premier, Pauline Marois, said the Caisse’s mandate should be strengthened to keep corporate headquarters in Quebec hands. The company was founded in Quebec in 1939 by independent hardware stores keen to ditch their powerful wholesalers, and about half of its 30,000 employees are in the mainly French-speaking province. Rona supplies almost 1,500 outlets in Canada, including about 240 corporate stores and more than 500 dealers and franchises. Michael Allen, whose family owns a 57,000-square-foot Rona store in Vancouver, British Columbia, said he still supports the company’s board. In August, Allen helped organize a group of Rona dealers that criticized the Lowe’s proposal. “It’s all a bit of a shock,” he said of Dutton’s departure. “I respected Robert Dutton very much.” Allen and other independent dealers own about 10 percent of Rona’s stock, and if they are unhappy with the company’s direction, they can take their business elsewhere. Allen said it would depend on the situation. “I would stay with Rona as long as Rona wants us as partners, and holds up their end of the bargain,” he said. Allen, whose growing, profitable outlet clears about C$10 million in sales each year, said he would prefer to remain part of a Canadian distribution network. Shares of Rona were up 4.8 percent at C$11.51 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

The move could pit Invesco, with about 10.16 percent of Rona’s outstanding shares, against the company’s current board, a number of its independent dealers, and even the government in its home province of Quebec. In a statement late on Wednesday, Rona said it was aware of Invesco’s intentions on electing new directors but it had not received a meeting requisition from Invesco or any other shareholder. “Invesco contacted Rona in the last few days requesting a meeting with Rona’s chairman, which Invesco and Rona had agreed to hold later this week. Invesco indicated earlier today that it no longer wanted to hold this meeting and issued its press release,” the company said in a statement. U.S.-based rival Lowe’s Cos Inc withdrew a C$1.8 billion ($1.8 billion) proposal to buy Rona in mid-September in the face of stiff opposition. But Rona’s longtime chief executive, Robert Dutton, stepped down on Friday following disappointing results, prompting speculation that the company could be in play. Norman Levine, managing director at Toronto investment firm Portfolio Management Corp, said Invesco’s move against the board was long overdue. “For the last five years they’ve had negative same-store sales, profit has gone nowhere and the stock has sunk. There’s been nothing to be happy about as a shareholder of Rona, and yet the board supported Robert Dutton all along,” he said. Levine, whose firm has a small stake in Rona, would like to see a new board return to the table with Lowe’s and negotiate a friendly deal. “This is a deal that makes sense for both sides,” he said. “Lowe’s needs Rona to extend across the country ... Rona needs a new direction, needs somebody in there to help them, and Lowe’s can provide that expertise.” Canaccord Genuity analyst Derek Dley said he was not surprised by Invesco’s announcement, given how much has changed over the course of a week. “It’s interesting - it’s going to fuel increased speculation that there may be a transaction down the road,” he said. Rona was much discussed during Quebec’s autumn provincial election, with both the incumbent Liberal Party and the eventual winner, the Parti Quebecois, opposed to a takeover. Rona’s biggest shareholder is Quebec pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which controls just over 15 percent of the firm, according to Thomson Reuters data. One key question is how the fund would respond to a bid for Rona. Spokesman Maxime Chagnon said the Caisse never discusses its investment strategy in advance, and he had no specific comment on Invesco, but he did speak generally about the company. “We recognize Mr. Dutton’s work, his contribution to Rona over the last 35 years, and we fully respect the decision, but now ... we believe Rona must look to the future and focus all of its energy on improving performance,” he said. “The results announced last week reinforced the importance of Rona improving performance.” Rona’s acting chief executive, Dominique Boies, joined Rona in 2011 after five years with the Caisse. The fund, which has a dual mandate of managing the Quebec pension plan and contributing to economic development, boosted its stake in Rona after Lowe’s made its proposal. In September, Quebec’s new premier, Pauline Marois, said the Caisse’s mandate should be strengthened to keep corporate headquarters in Quebec hands. The company was founded in Quebec in 1939 by independent hardware stores keen to ditch their powerful wholesalers, and about half of its 30,000 employees are in the mainly French-speaking province. Rona supplies almost 1,500 outlets in Canada, including about 240 corporate stores and more than 500 dealers and franchises. Michael Allen, whose family owns a 57,000-square-foot Rona store in Vancouver, British Columbia, said he still supports the company’s board. In August, Allen helped to organize a group of Rona dealers that criticized Lowe’s proposal. “It’s all a bit of a shock,” he said of Dutton’s departure. “I respected Robert Dutton very much.” Allen and other independent dealers own about 10 percent of Rona’s stock, and if they are unhappy with the company’s direction, they can take their business elsewhere. “I would stay with Rona as long as Rona wants us as partners, and holds up their end of the bargain,” he said. Allen, whose growing, profitable outlet clears about C$10 million in sales each year, said he would prefer to remain part of a Canadian distribution network. Shares of Rona were up 4.8 percent at C$11.51 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Shares of Lowe’s, which also raised its sales forecast for the year, ended 6.2 percent higher at $33.96 in regular trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Rival Home Depot (HD.N) has won shoppers from Lowe’s in recent years by offering better pricing and service, while Lowe’s strategy of “everyday low prices” rather than promotions has driven some customers away.

U.S. home resales rose in October and a gauge of homebuilder sentiment climbed to a six-year high in November, signs the housing sector’s recovery is gaining traction. “It gives the homeowner what I call the psychological permission to spend on their home because they feel better about what the home’s going to be worth in the future,” Lowe’s Chief Executive Robert Niblock told Reuters. Sales at Lowe’s stores open at least year rose 1.8 percent globally and in the United States, after declining in he previous quarter. Still, it was the 14th straight quarter that Lowe’s same-store sales lagged those of Home Depot, which last week raised its full-year outlook independently of any future sales lift from Sandy. Lowe’s said sales rose 1.9 percent to $12.1 billion in its fiscal third quarter, ended November 2. That compared with the $11.9 billion expected on average by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said it now expects total sales for the fiscal year to be up 2 percent, excluding the effect of an extra week, compared with an earlier forecast of a 1 percent rise. The retailer’s third-quarter net income rose to $396 million, or 35 cents per share, from $225 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding some items like write-downs and a charge for a discontinued project, profit came to 40 cents a share, 5 cents higher than analysts’ estimates.

Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter, in a research note, called the results “a promising inflection,” a sign that efforts by Lowe’s are “beginning to take hold.” The company’s current transformation phase is set to end in mid-2013. Lowe’s third-quarter sales received a lift from people buying items like generators, flashlights and batteries ahead of Sandy, which made landfall on October 29, killing dozens and leaving millions without power for days and weeks, Niblock said.

88,LOW,US STOCKS-Wall St bounces on hopes for budget talk success,"* U.S. lawmakers say they’re confident they can avoid “fiscal cliff” * Existing home sales, homebuilder sentiment climb * Earnings boost Lowe’s, Tyson Foods * Indexes up: Dow 1.3 pct, S&P; 1.6 pct, Nasdaq 1.8 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street climbed on Monday , putting the S&P; 500 on track for its second straight advance a s investors were en couraged by the early tone in talks to ta ckle the fiscal crunch and data that showed con tinued improvement in the housing recovery. The S&P; 500 is up more than 2 percent over the past two sessions as rhetoric from legislators has provided investors with some hope a deal could be reached to stave off the looming “fiscal cliff,” a se ries of tax and spending changes that will start to come into effect in the new year. Before the recent gains, the benchmark S&P; index had fallen 5.3 percent since Election D a y, as concerns about Washington’s ability to reach an agreement became the top focus for investors. Over the weekend, leading Democratic and Republican lawmakers expressed confidence that they could reach a deal to avert the “fiscal cliff”, even as they laid down markers on raising taxes and spending cuts that may make any agreement more difficult. But the recent climb could prove to simply be a bounce from the sharp declines, with market volatility expected to be heightened by the perception of negotiation progress. “There has been a pretty steady downward move for a while so you are going to have days like this, especially when the news is good,” said Uri Landesman, pr e sident at Platinum Partners in New York. “In general, what you are going to watch is if there is no deal, you are going to see the market trade down during the week.” Stronger-than-expected earnings from Lowe’s and Tyson Foods, as well as encouraging housing data, also contributed to the market’s advance. Ty son and Lowe’s were the top two percentage gainers on the S&P; 500. U.S. home resales unexpectedly increased in October, while separate data showed homebuilder sentiment rose to its highest level in over six years in November. The PHLX Housing Index rose 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 173.72 points, or 1.38 percent, to 12,762.03. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 22.52 points, or 1.66 percent, to 1,382.40. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 51.59 points, or 1.81 percent, to 2,904.72. The S&P; was holding near its 200-day moving average at around 1,382, which has acted as a resistance level since a drop below the technically significant mark on November 8. Shares of Lowe’s Cos Inc, the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain, jumped 6.1 percent to $33.94 after the company reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year sales forecast. Tyson Foods Inc likewise beat expectations and gave an upbeat forecast, sending its stock up 7.8 percent at $18.20. Intel shares edged lower, down 0.2 percent to $20.15 after the company said its chief executive will retire in May. Commodities prices surged, boosting shares of resource companies.

The move comes just a few months after Rona, Canada’s top distributor of hardware, home renovation and gardening products, rebuffed an unsolicited C$1.8 billion ($1.81 billion) takeover proposal from U.S.-based Lowe’s Cos Inc. It could signal a greater willingness to consider a sale of the company, which has performed poorly against Lowe’s and Home Depot Inc on its home turf, analysts said. “We view today’s announcement as favorable to Rona’s stock,” said Barclays Capital analyst Jim Durran in a note. “The changes could result in more receptive dialogue regarding potential divestitures, or outright sale of the company.” The board changes are a precursor to bigger changes at the company, Robert Chevrier, the new executive chairman, said in an interview with Reuters. Chevrier said the company plans to sell certain non-core assets and make some “drastic moves” to address the bleed at its big-box stores. Rona’s Toronto-listed shares, which have fallen almost 20 percent from a 52-week high of C$14.49, closed more than 3 percent higher at C$11.86 on Monday, following the reshuffle. Chevrier, the former chairman of distributor Richelieu Hardware, replaces Robert Pare, who remains a board member. The change is the second step in an overhaul that began late last year when Rona sacked long-time Chief Executive Robert Dutton and said it would sell assets and simplify operations. Rona has grown rapidly in the last three decades through a series of acquisitions but stumbled in recent years as Home Depot and Lowe’s, respectively the world’s No. 1 and No. 2 home improvement chains, have stepped up competition in the Canadian market. Rona, based in Boucherville, Quebec, also named four other new board members on Monday, following an agreement with its two top shareholders; Quebec’s public pension fund manager Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, and fund manager Invesco Canada. Invesco had publicly backed Lowe’s bid for Rona, which was withdrawn in September in the face of opposition from Rona’s board, provincial politicians in Quebec and from many of Rona’s independent dealers. Caisse took no public position on the deal except to announce a marginal increase in its Rona shareholding. In November, Invesco publicly called for the removal of Rona’s board and outlined plans to requisition a shareholder meeting. Invesco, however, had yet to name a slate of nominees for election to Rona’s board. Rona said both Caisse and Invesco have now agreed to back its slate of nominees at a shareholder meeting in May. The two investors together own almost 27 percent of Rona’s outstanding shares, according to the latest Thomson Reuters data. Investors grew more vocal about the need for change at Rona, after it reported another set of weak results in November, on the heels of a string of sales declines at established stores. Rona said on Monday it has also retained the services of a top global management consulting firm to work on its strategic priorities announced in December. At the time, the company said it would sell assets and simplify its operations as part of a back-to-its-roots strategy. Rona said two of its board members, Alain Michel and Patrick Palerme, have resigned, effective immediately. Two other current directors will not stand for re-election at Rona’s annual shareholder meeting on May 14. The company said the four new individuals joining its board, effective immediately, are Bernard Dorval, former group head of insurance & global development at TD Bank; Wesley Voorheis, partner at Voorheis & Co LLP; Guy Dufresne, former president of ArcelorMittal Mines Canada; and Barry Gilbertson, principal with Barry Gilbertson Consultancy. In addition, two other board members, Steven Richardson and another nominee, will be included in the company’s circular for election at Rona’s next annual general meeting of shareholders. Rona, which is currently being led by interim CEO Dominique Boies, said it expects to be in a position to provide an update on its process to recruit a new CEO before the end of February. The company said the new CEO would also be named to its board of directors on appointment, replacing a current director. Following the changes, the total number of Rona directors will increase to 14 from 12, and eight of its board members will be new directors, the company said.

96,LOW,Lowe's margin outlook disappoints; turnaround questioned,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc’s (LOW.N) forecast a fiscal-year operating margin on Monday that analysts said did little to boost confidence in the U.S. housing market or the retailer’s own turnaround. The news overshadowed stronger-than-expected quarterly results and caused some on Wall Street to worry that investors in the second-largest home improvement chain might have to wait longer than they had anticipated to see Lowe’s catch up with larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N). Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom said Lowe’s outlook for an operating margin rise of about 60 basis points in the current fiscal year was “ho-hum.” “That basically means that investors need to wait another year for maybe the Lowe’s outperformance story to take hold,” he said. “People were hoping for that to come in 2013.” Home Depot plans to report results on Tuesday, and most analysts expect the industry leader’s same-store sales to outpace those from Lowe’s for the 15th straight quarter. Lowe’s shares were down 1.8 percent at $37 in afternoon trading, while Home Depot fell 0.2 percent to $65.46. Citi analyst Kate McShane said Lowe’s outlook might be conservative, given that the company expects meaningful same-store sales and gross margin benefits by the second half. Still, she maintained her “neutral” rating on the stock, citing Lowe’s underperformance against Home Depot and a choppy economy. “The lack of incremental visibility on the company’s progress against key initiatives keeps us on the sidelines,” McShane added. Lowe’s said it expected its fiscal-year sales to rise about 4 percent from $50.52 billion in the year ended on February 1. While “home value perception” ratings are the strongest they have been in four years, tight credit conditions and high mortgage delinquencies will restrain the speed at which housing and, therefore, the home improvement industry can grow, Lowe’s Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock told investors. The housing market has shown some signs of recovery from a collapse that helped push the economy into its worst recession since the Great Depression. Homebuilding added to national economic growth in 2012 for the first time since 2005 and is expected to provide more support this year. “While we see a modest recovery in housing, we see rising interest rates as a threat to home refinancing, a key driver of remodeling,” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Michael Souers said. In its fourth quarter, Lowe’s benefited from rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy and the retailer’s efforts to improve product selection and customer service. As part of its makeover, the company has started offering everyday low prices and products targeted to specific geographic markets. It made its stores more appealing with improved signs, television displays that stream videos on how-to-do projects, and lower racks to make items easier to reach. Lowe’s has also increased its assortment of products available online and started mylowes.com, a site that allows shoppers to save their room dimensions, create a shopping list and set reminders to buy items such as air filters and batteries for smoke alarms. Net income was $288 million, or 26 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $322 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 23 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 5 percent to $11.05 billion, but exceeded the analysts’ average estimate of $10.84 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.9 percent both globally and in the United States. Sandy made landfall five days before the start of Lowe’s fourth quarter and boosted same-store sales by about 70 basis points. The company forecast a 3.5 percent increase in fiscal-year same-store sales. It expects earnings of $2.05 a share for the period.

101,LOW,Lowe's sales improve after weak start to spring,"(Reuters) - No. 2 home improvement chain Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reassured investors that sales trends improved significantly in April and May after seeing a weak start to the spring selling season. The news pushed Lowe’s shares to an all-time high and overshadowed the weaker-than-expected first-quarter results the chain reported on Wednesday, as colder-than-usual weather hurt demand for lawn and garden and other seasonal goods. “We do believe that we will make up a significant portion of the sales that we lost in the first quarter,” Chief Executive Robert Niblock said in an interview, referring to more favorable weather trends in the current quarter. Like its larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Lowe’s said it was seeing strong sales to contractors. For the first time since 2008, sales to contractors and professional customers grew at a faster pace than those to regular homeowners and other shoppers, Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said on Tuesday. “All that just speaks to what you have been hearing about the housing market starting to recover,” Niblock told Reuters. While Wall Street expects the housing market recovery to help both retailers, some analysts predict that Home Depot will continue to outperform Lowe’s on the sales front for a while, partly due to a structural advantage. Home Depot derives 35 percent of its sales from contractors and professional customers, while Lowe’s derives only 25 percent of sales from professional customers, RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli said. Ciccarelli said it was “hard to close” that gap because Home Depot had more stores than Lowe’s in major metro areas and many of the professional contractors and their businesses were based in those areas. On a conference call, Lowe’s said same-store sales rose about 10 percent in April after falling 10 percent in March. Lowe’s also managed to maintain the momentum in same-store sales in the first three weeks of May, the company said. Lowe’s sales fell 0.5 percent to $13.09 billion in the first quarter ended on May 3, missing the analysts’ average estimate of $13.45 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year dipped 0.7 percent. It was the 16th straight quarter that Lowe’s posted weaker same-store sales than Home Depot. “The spread between Home Depot and Lowe’s (same-store sales) expanded in the first quarter, something we had worried might happen,” said Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser. Lowe’s stocked more lawn and garden products than Home Depot and as a result suffered more from the unfavorable weather, Strasser said. At the same time, he said, Home Depot had a greater presence in California, where housing has made a strong comeback. While Lowe’s has been working to improve product selection and customer service, it has yet to turn around its business. If Lowe’s does not close the performance gap with Home Depot by late 2013 or early 2014, investors may conclude that Lowe’s has failed to benefit as much as expected from its exposure to the U.S. housing market, Ciccarelli said by phone. “I would be very surprised if it caught Home Depot in this cycle in terms of same-store sales, market share,” said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer of Sarasota-based wealth manager Global Financial Private Capital that owns Lowe’s shares. He wants the company to close more unprofitable stores. As part of its makeover, the company has started offering everyday low prices and products targeted to specific geographic markets.

Analysts on average expected a profit of 51 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

104,LOW,"Orchard Supply files for bankruptcy, Lowe's steps in","(Reuters) - Orchard Supply Hardware Stores Corp OSH.O, spun off by Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) less than two years ago, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection partly blaming hefty dividends paid out to its former parent. Rival retailer Lowe’s Companies (LOW.N) said it would buy at least 60 of Orchard’s 91 neighborhood hardware and garden stores in California for about $205 million and also assume payables owed to nearly all of Orchard’s suppliers. Orchard shares were up 22 percent at $2.30 in early trading on Monday. The stock had fallen about 50 percent from early June up to Friday’s close. Orchard said in a court filing that it was carrying a high debt load and that it may not be able to make payments when the first tranche matures in December. The company, which generated revenue of $657 million in fiscal 2012, listed total liabilities of $480.1 million and total assets of $441 million. “The company’s substantial debt due, in part, to significant recapitalization dividends paid to Sears, made it difficult, if not impossible for the company to right itself,” Orchard said. Management and the board determined that a sale of Orchard through a Chapter 11 process was the best possible outcome for the company and its stakeholders, Orchard said. The company has secured commitments for $177 million in debtor-in-possession financing, which will help it meet financial obligations through the bankruptcy. Orchard said Lowe’s would act as a “stalking horse bidder,” setting a minimum offer for the business, which could still be topped by others. If there are no competing bids, the home improvement retailer will acquire Orchard’s assets after obtaining bankruptcy court approval. Lowe’s plans to operate Orchard as a standalone business, retaining its brand and management. “Strategically, the acquisition will provide us with immediate access to Orchard’s high density, prime locations in attractive markets in California, where Lowe’s is currently underpenetrated,” said Robert Niblock, Lowe’s chairman, president and chief executive. Orchard said it expects the bankruptcy process to be completed in about 90 days. “This transaction is both a smart and modest capital investment to attack a critical real estate shortcoming that Lowe’s has relative to Home Depot (HD.N),” Janney Montgomery Scott LLC analyst David Strasser wrote in a note. Lowe’s lacks conveniently located stores in key metro markets compared to Home Depot, and this deal could bridge that gap, particularly in markets like California, Strasser added. The analyst has a “neutral” rating on Lowe’s stock. Lowe’s shares were up less than 1 percent at $41.42.

107,LOW,Lowe's narrows sales gap with Home Depot,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results as the housing market’s recovery encouraged Americans to spend more on their homes, and the No. 2 home improvement chain narrowed its sales gap against rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N). The results prompted Lowe’s to raise its fiscal-year outlook, and its shares hit an all-time high on a split adjusted basis on Wednesday. The news came the day after Home Depot also reported rosy results, giving further proof of the strength in the U.S. housing market recovery. Lowe’s sales at stores open at least a year rose 9.6 percent in the second quarter ended on August 2 but trailed the 10.7 percent increase at Home Depot. However, that is the narrowest gap in same-store sales between the two retailers since the third quarter of 2010, BMO Capital Markets analyst Wayne Hood said. “This could signal that (Lowe’s) product line reviews and merchandise assortment overhaul are starting to work,” Hood said. Home improvement chains, whose sales crumbled during the housing downturn, are enjoying a comeback as rising prices for homes have led to renewed interest in renovating them. “We think both companies are on a pretty good surfboard in front of a pretty good tsunami,” said Bill Smead, a portfolio manager at the Smead Value Fund in Seattle. U.S. home resales rose in July to a more than three-year high, the National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday, suggesting a sharp rise in borrowing costs has had only a limited impact on the housing recovery so far. “The rate increases will likely take some steam out of the recent housing market rebounds, but shouldn’t derail it as long as job gains persist, homes continue to appreciate and rates rise more gradually going forward,” Lowe’s Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said on a conference call. Smead’s firm holds Home Depot shares and sees better longer-term prospects for the industry leader, citing its strong management team, free cash flow and balance sheet. Some analysts also say Home Depot will continue to outperform Lowe’s on the sales front for a while, in part because it derives much more revenue from the key contractor and professional customer group. These customers account for 35 percent of Home Depot’s sales, compared with 25 percent at Lowe’s. Some analysts have said it is hard to close that gap quickly because Home Depot has more stores than Lowe’s in major metropolitan areas, where many of the professional contractors are based. Lowe’s recently agreed to buy several neighborhood hardware and garden stores in California from Orchard Supply Hardware Stores Corp OSHWQ.PK, which Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) spun off less than two years ago. The deal gave Lowe’s access to Orchard’s prime locations in high-density markets in California, an area where it was under-represented. Shares of Lowe’s were up 4.4 percent at $46.05 in afternoon trading after rising as high as $47.25 earlier in the session. Home Depot dipped 0.2 percent to $74.11. Both stocks trade around 19 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, making them more expensive than many of their retail peers. PLAYING CATCH-UP Lowe’s net earnings rose to $941 million, or 88 cents a share, in the second quarter from $747 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier.

For the fiscal year ending January 31, Lowe’s said it expected total sales to rise about 5 percent, while it had previously called for a 4 percent increase. It raised its earnings-per-share forecast to about $2.10 from $2.05. Home Depot was quicker than Lowe’s to cut costs during the recession.

Investors have been grappling over the past several weeks with uncertainty about when the Fed will begin to wind down its $85 billion a month stimulus program. The minutes from the meeting may provide clues to the timing and scope of the Fed’s tapering. The minutes will be released at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT). “I believe tapering is going to begin in September because it has to. The market needs to adjust to the beginning of getting back to normal on rates,” said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING U.S. Investment Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 57.32 points or 0.38 percent, to 14,945.67, the S&P; 500 lost 5.32 points or 0.32 percent, to 1,647.03 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 2.977 points or 0.08 percent, to 3,610.613. The S&P; 500 rose on Tuesday to halt a four-day losing streak but remained under technical pressure as it closed below its 50-day moving average for a third straight session. The level, near 1,658, is becoming technical resistance. Retailers were in focus for a second day on Wednesday with earnings from Lowe’s, Target and others. Target warned its annual profit may be near the low end of its forecast as consumer spending remains cautious, sending it shares 1.9 percent lower to $66.65. Staples reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results on dismal sales in international markets and cut its outlook for the year. Shares slumped 12.5 percent to $14.73. . Shares of home improvement chain Lowe’s rose 5.4 percent to $46.48 after it reported a bigger-than-expected rise in profit and sales as the housing market’s recovery encouraged people to spend more on their homes.

Chris Nutall ran for two scores while Tyler Jones was 14-of-18 for 196 yards and a touchdown for Texas State (3-1), which gave coach Dennis Franchione his 200th victory. The Bobcats, who entered with the nation’s fourth-best rushing defense at 62 yards per game, outgained Wyoming 256-64 on the ground. Brandon Miller rushed for a pair of scores for Wyoming (3-2), which lost to a Sun Belt Conference team for the first time in seven games. Quarterback Brett Smith, who became the Cowboys’ all-time touchdown pass leader last week, was 25-of-48 for 292 yards and a touchdown - the 61st of his career. The game was tied 7-7 when it was halted with 8:34 remaining in the second quarter - the third time a Wyoming game has been interrupted by thunderstorms this season. Jones found Ben Ijah for a 26-yard TD pass with 29 seconds left in the first half to make it 14-14 and start a string of 28 straight points for Texas State. After a three-and-out on its first possession of the third quarter, Lowe’s second touchdown run - a 5-yarder - was followed by TD runs of 22 and 5 yards by Nutall to give the Bobcats a 35-14 lead with 13:11 left. Lowe’s 19-yard run capped the scoring with 3 seconds to go as Texas State improved to 3-1 for the first time since 2003.",9292013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fbc-wyoming-texasstate-recap/texas-state-42-wyoming-21-idUSMTZE99TUYK0N520130929
115,LOW,Lowe's outlook disappoints; retailer still lags Home Depot,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported slightly lower-than-expected quarterly earnings and gave a disappointing fiscal-year outlook, underscoring the No. 2 home improvement retailer’s struggle to catch up with market leader Home Depot. Wednesday’s news came the day after strong results from Home Depot Inc (HD.N), which increased its forecast for the year for the third time in three quarters as rising housing prices encouraged more people to invest in their homes. Lowe’s results also made some analysts wonder if rising interest rates would take some steam out of the recent housing market rebound that has encouraged homeowners to take up more expensive remodeling projects. “In addition to missing earnings-per-share estimates, interest rates are rising and housing is slowing, calling into question continued outperformance in this space in 2014,” Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said. A report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday showed sales of existing homes fell 3.2 percent in October. The median price of a previously owned home rose 12.8 percent from a year ago. Lowe’s shares were down 5.1 percent at $47.85 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Home Depot fell 0.5 percent to $80.01. On a conference call, Lowe’s executives said discretionary spending on larger home projects was still far below pre-recession peaks. They also said competition in the appliance market had eaten into the company’s gross margin. Even though Lowe’s issued an outlook below analysts’ estimates, Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said the home improvement industry was poised for growth this quarter and for “further acceleration” in the next fiscal year. In an interview, Niblock said the company had not seen interest rates hurting the recovery in home improvement sales so far. Lowe’s, once a Wall Street darling, is not just a victim of the vagaries in the housing market. It was slower than Home Depot to cut costs during the most recent U.S. recession. Some analysts also say Home Depot will continue to outperform Lowe’s on the sales front for a while, in part because it derives much more revenue from the key contractor and professional customer group. These customers account for 35 percent of Home Depot’s sales, compared with 25 percent at Lowe’s. Some analysts say it is hard to close that gap quickly because Home Depot has more stores than Lowe’s in major metropolitan areas, where many of the professional contractors are based. Sales at Lowe’s stores open at least a year rose 6.2 percent in the third quarter ended November 1. It was the 18th straight quarter that the company posted weaker same-store sales than Home Depot. At the end of 2012, Home Depot had 18.7 percent of the U.S. home improvement market, while Lowe’s had 15.2 percent, data from Euromonitor International showed. The research firm expects Home Depot to have a 19.2 percent share and Lowe’s to have 15.6 percent by the end of this year. In recent years, Home Depot has benefited from efforts to improve customer service and win shoppers with more compelling prices than its rivals. It has tailored its marketing to local areas, centralized distribution centers and shifted more workers to jobs where they serve shoppers directly. After losing share to Home Depot for several quarters, Lowe’s laid out a turnaround plan, offering everyday low prices and products targeted to specific geographic markets. Lowe’s also made its stores more appealing with improved signs, television displays that stream videos on how-to-do projects, and lower racks to make items easier to reach. For the fiscal year ending January 31, Lowe’s raised its earnings forecast to about $2.15 a share from $2.10. However, the new outlook fell short of the analysts’ average estimate of $2.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The retailer also increased its outlook for sales growth for the year to about 6 percent from 5 percent. Net earnings in the third quarter rose to $499 million, or 47 cents a share, from $396 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 48 cents a share. Sales increased 7.3 percent to $12.96 billion, topping the analysts’ average estimate of $12.72 billion.

120,LOW,Lowe's outperforms Home Depot in stormy quarter,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc reported strong growth in quarterly sales, showing that the No. 2 U.S. home improvement retailer was narrowing the gap with market leader Home Depot Inc. Lowe’s shares rose more than 6 percent in early trading, after the company reported that net sales increased 5.6 percent to $11.66 billion in the fourth quarter ended January 31. Home Depot on Tuesday reported a 3 percent decline in sales in the same period, which was marked by winter storms and record cold in much of North America. Lowe’s big rival is more dependent on contractors, who had trouble working on projects in the stormy quarter. “When extreme winter weather arrived late in the quarter, our distribution network responded quickly and efficiently to move product where it was most needed,” Lowe’s CEO Robert Niblock said in a statement on Wednesday. Demand was strong for products such snow blowers, space heaters and fittings to fix broken pipes, the company said. Home Depot’s results had raised concerns that the U.S. housing recovery was losing momentum. But Niblock said Lowe’s continued to see strength in “recovery markets” such as California, Arizona and Florida. “With consumers more willing to invest in their homes, the job and income growth forecasted for 2014 should provide the wherewithal for continued home improvement spending,” Niblock said on a call with analysts. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday that sales of new single-family homes surged to a 5-1/2 year high in January. Lowe’s, which struggled to catch up with Home Depot after the recession, has tried to arrest market-share losses by offering discounts and products aimed at specific regions. The company posted a 3.9 percent rise in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter. It also said its board had authorized an additional $5 billion share repurchase program Lowe’s gross margin expanded to 34.67 percent in the quarter ended January 31 from 34.27 a year earlier. “We believe that Lowe’s has made significant operational strides, and is now positioned to benefit from its investments in its store resets and product line reviews,” Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter wrote in a note to clients. Lowe’s reported a 6.3 percent rise in fourth-quarter net income to $306 million, or 29 cents per share, up from $288 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. “For businesses that are this mature, to find growth like this is fairly difficult,” Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 31 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Home Depot’s net profit fell about 1 percent in the quarter.

Lowe’s shares rose as much as 7 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday. The company said its net sales rose 5.6 percent to $11.66 billion in the fourth-quarter ended Jan. 31. Analysts on average were expecting sales of $11.67 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lowe’s posted a 3.9 percent rise in comparable store sales. Home Depot reported a 3 percent decline in overall sales on Tuesday, which some analysts viewed as an indication that the recent U.S. housing recovery was losing momentum. Lowe’s said it expects 2014 total sales to rise by about 5 percent. That translates to about $56.07 billion. The company also forecast earnings of about $2.60 per share for the year ending Jan. 30, 2015. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $2.64 per share on sales of $56.25 billion. Lowe’s net income rose to $306 million, or 29 cents per share, in the fourth quarter from $288 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 31 cents per share. The Mooresville, North Carolina-based company also said its board has authorized an additional $5 billion share repurchase program. Lowe’s shares rose about 34 percent in the year to Tuesday’s close of $48.11 on the New York Stock Exchange. They trade at 18.03 times forward earnings, while Home Depot shares trade at 17.54 times.

124,LOW,Lowe's outperforms Home Depot in stormy quarter,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported strong growth in quarterly sales on Wednesday, showing that the No. 2 U.S. home improvement retailer was narrowing the gap with market leader Home Depot Inc (HD.N). Lowe’s shares rose more than 6 percent in early trading, after the company reported that net sales increased 5.6 percent to $11.66 billion in the fourth quarter ended January 31. Home Depot on Tuesday reported a 3 percent decline in sales in the same period, which was marked by winter storms and record cold in much of North America. Home Depot’s fourth-quarter, however, had one week less than the prior-year quarter. Excluding the additional week in 2012, sales for the fourth quarter were up 3.9 percent. Lowe’s big rival is more dependent on contractors, who had trouble working on projects in the stormy quarter. “When extreme winter weather arrived late in the quarter, our distribution network responded quickly and efficiently to move product where it was most needed,” Lowe’s CEO Robert Niblock said in a statement on Wednesday. Demand was strong for products such as snow blowers, space heaters and fittings to fix broken pipes, the company said. Home Depot’s results had raised concerns that the U.S. housing recovery was losing momentum. But Niblock said Lowe’s continued to see strength in “recovery markets” such as California, Arizona and Florida. “With consumers more willing to invest in their homes, the job and income growth forecasted for 2014 should provide the wherewithal for continued home improvement spending,” Niblock said on a call with analysts. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday that sales of new single-family homes surged to a 5-1/2 year high in January. Lowe’s, which struggled to catch up with Home Depot after the recession, has tried to arrest market-share losses by offering discounts and products aimed at specific regions. The company posted a 3.9 percent rise in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter. It also said its board had authorized an additional $5 billion share repurchase program Lowe’s gross margin expanded to 34.67 percent in the quarter ended January 31 from 34.27 a year earlier. “We believe that Lowe’s has made significant operational strides, and is now positioned to benefit from its investments in its store resets and product line reviews,” Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter wrote in a note to clients. Lowe’s reported a 6.3 percent rise in fourth-quarter net income to $306 million, or 29 cents per share, up from $288 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. “For businesses that are this mature, to find growth like this is fairly difficult,” Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 31 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Home Depot’s net profit fell about 1 percent in the quarter. Lowe’s said it expected 2014 total sales to rise by about 5 percent. That translates to about $56.07 billion. The company also forecast earnings of about $2.60 per share for the year ending January 30, 2015. Analysts on average were expecting $2.64 per share on sales of $56.25 billion. Lowe’s shares closed up 5.4 percent at $50.72 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. They had risen about 34 percent in the year up to Tuesday’s close. Home Depot’s shares, which closed up 0.9 percent at $81.70, have risen about 27 percent in one year. Lowe’s shares were trading at 18.03 times forward earnings as of Tuesday’s close, while Home Depot shares were trading at 17.54 times.

125,LOW,"UPDATE 2-Lowe's to pay $500,000 in EPA lead paint settlement","(Adds response from company, background on lead dangers, updates share price) By Julia Edwards WASHINGTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Lowe’s Home Centers , the No. 2 U.S. home improvement retail chain, has agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty for violating federal rules governing lead paint exposure, U.S. authorities said on Thursday. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice said Lowe’s had also agreed to implement a new compliance program at more than 1,700 stores nationwide. Lead exposure can cause a range of health problems, from behavioral disorders and learning disabilities to seizures and death. Young children are at the greatest risk because their nervous systems are still developing. Lead-based paint was banned in the United States in 1978 but remains in many older homes and apartments. Dust hazards can occur when the paint deteriorates or is disrupted during home renovation and remodeling. An EPA investigation found that Lowe’s could not provide documentation to prove that contractors it hired to work at 13 stores across nine states were certified by the agency, or had used its approved kits to test for lead paint at work sites, the EPA said. “Today’s settlement sends a clear message to all contractors and the firms they hire: Get lead certified and comply with the law to protect children from exposure to dangerous lead dust,” said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. In a statement Lowe’s said it “has had an aggressive lead-based paint renovation compliance program in place since the EPA’s Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule went into effect” and that there had been no reports of lead-based paint health issues associated with projects completed by its  contractors. Lowe’s shares were up nearly 0.3 percent at $46.85 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Fed will release the minutes from its late-April meeting at 2:00 p.m. (1800 GMT). At the time, the central bank looked past a dismal reading on first-quarter U.S. growth and gave a mostly upbeat assessment of the economy’s prospects as it announced another cut in its massive bond-buying stimulus. “I suspect they are going to continue this low interest rate environment, very accommodative monetary policy, for a very long period of time in an effort to help markets feel a little bit calmer as it relates to a hike in interest rates,” said Joseph Tanious, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The gains put the S&P; 500 on track for its third advance in the past four days. Equities have been uneven recently, however, and the benchmark S&P; index is down about 1 percent from its record intraday high reached on May 13. “Markets are still struggling to find some meaningful direction this year; so far we have seen quite a bit of choppiness in the markets - that, in and of itself, leads investors to be very nervous,” said Tanious. New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said on Tuesday inflation should “drift upwards” towards the Fed’s 2 percent goal, but a swift climb in inflation was unlikely. Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said the $2.5 trillion in reserves accumulated by banks could trigger more rapid inflation. Tiffany & Co jumped 8.6 percent to $95.81 as the best performer on the S&P; 500 after the jewelry retailer reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year profit forecast. Lowe’s Companies slipped 0.6 percent to $45.26  after the world’s second-largest home improvement chain said sales picked up in May and it would maintain its full-year sales growth forecast, even as it reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results.

128,LOW,"Lowe's May sales improve, severe winter hits first-quarter results","(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), the world’s No.2 home improvement chain, said sales picked up in May, after a severe winter in the United States hurt its quarterly results. The company also maintained its sales growth forecast of 5 percent for the year ending January 30. Lowe’s sales rose 2.4 percent in the first quarter ended May 2, as strong demand for indoor products such as lightbulbs and faucets more than offset the impact of weakness in outdoor categories, including lumber, building materials and paint. Chief Executive Robert Niblock told Reuters that the company was witnessing a pickup in sale of outdoor power equipment, exterior paint and other weather-dependent categories. “We do believe that we will recoup the majority of those (lost) sales in the second quarter,” Niblock said. Spring is an important season for home improvement retailers as building renovations pick up and households prepare their gardens. Bigger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) said on Tuesday that its May sales were “robust” and it expected to realize in the current quarter most of the sales lost in the first quarter. “Similar to Home Depot ... Lowe’s guidance implies the difficult winter weather in (the first quarter) delayed spring seasonal sales rather than eliminated them,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Laura Champine wrote in a note. Some analysts said the recent slowdown in the U.S. housing market was a risk for home improvement chains, but Lowe’s joined Home Depot in downplaying the concerns. Lowe’s said stronger job and income growth and loosening credit conditions were favorable for spending on home improvements. “The backdrop for home industry growth remains positive,” Niblock said on a post-earnings call. However, Lowe’s comparable store sales growth lagged that of Home Depot in the first quarter. The world’s biggest home improvement chain is benefiting from improved merchandising, strong relationships with contractor clients and better store-level execution, Champine said. Home Depot, which gets most of its business from building contractors, posted a 2.6 percent rise in comparable store sales, while Lowe’s posted a 0.9 percent increase. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected Lowe’s comparable store sales to rise by 5 percent. Lowe’s raised its full-year earnings forecast to $2.63 per share from $2.60 per share due to a lower tax rate. Analysts on average were expecting $2.61 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lowe’s first-quarter revenue rose to $13.40 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $13.86 billion. Net income increased 15.6 percent to $624 million, or 61 cents per share. Excluding items, Lowe’s earned 58 cents per share, below analysts’ estimate of 60 cents per share. Lowe’s shares were down slightly at $45.30 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had fallen about 8 percent this year to Tuesday’s close.

132,LOW,GE's $3 bln credit card IPO pegged to U.S. consumer recovery,"July 18 (Reuters) - The success of General Electric Co’s  impending initial public offering for its private-label credit card unit could ride on investors’ willingness to bet that a lukewarm consumer-led U.S. economic recovery heats up. GE began its investor road show on Friday for the IPO of the unit, to be called Synchrony Financial, as it revealed new details about the business. Set for the end of the month, the IPO of 15 percent of Synchrony is expected to raise around $3.1 billion, surpassing Ally Financial Inc as the biggest U.S. financial services stock flotation this year. While the IPO could enjoy a positive initial reception given the strong demand for offerings this year and investors’ eagerness to deploy cash in the market, its longer-term performance will likely be hitched to the strength of the belief in a consumer recovery. “It’s a good indicator and good investment based on people who believe the economy is going to continue to improve as it relates to the consumer,” said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com, an IPO and secondary offering research firm. More than two-thirds of Synchrony’s $9.4 billion in revenue last year came from its retail card business, which offers private label credit cards carrying brands of corporate partners such as Amazon.com Inc, JC Penney Co, Lowe’s Companies Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Some of those retailers including JC Penney and Wal-Mart have struggled to find sales growth this year even as the broader economy has recovered, in part because a broad swath of consumers remains constrained by debt and worried about job prospects. Still, they could eventually benefit from a strengthening recovery. A gauge of U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in June, the U.S. Commerce Department reported earlier this week, indicating the economy ended the second quarter on stronger footing. Synchrony’s rivals in the private label card business include consumer banks such as Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo. Synchrony’s other revenue comes from financing for bigger ticket consumer purchases, such as electronics or jewelry, and for healthcare procedures. “My sense is this is fertile ground for a new offering,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “Holders of this paper, they have to believe in the long-term health of the economy and the consumer.” IPOs have performed well initially this year, with stocks rising 22 percent on average between the final offering price and the first day’s close, said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster LLC, which helps create index funds for IPOs. “Risk appetite is quite high because the market is obviously very strong,” Schuster said. GE, which revealed details for Synchrony on Friday as it posted a 13 percent rise in second-quarter profit, valued the rest of Synchrony at around $17 billion. GE plans to offer the rest of the business to its shareholders through an exchange late next year. “It is the most shareholder-friendly execution,” GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview. “It’s much more tax-efficient than selling the company outright for cash.” The separation is critical to GE’s plan to slim down its GE Capital finance business and boost its industrial operations to 75 percent of company earnings by 2016, up from 55 percent last year. “For GE, it’s more about de-risking the company and focusing on the areas in industrial where they want to focus their growth,” said Jim Corridore, an equity analyst with S&P; Capital IQ.

It started out strongly, then it looked like a bit of capitulation before the statement came out, and then we obviously saw a big sigh of relief,” said Drew Wilson, an equity analyst at Fenimore Asset Management in Cobleskill, New York. With the minutes out, investors have turned their attention to the annual meeting of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which will take place from Thursday through Saturday.  Fed Chair Janet Yellen is expected to acknowledge during the conference that while economic data has generally been supportive, she remains concerned about slack in the labor market. She is scheduled to speak on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 59.54 points, or 0.35 percent, to end at 16,979.13. The S&P; 500 gained 4.91 points, or 0.25 percent, to finish at 1,986.51. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.03 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 4,526.48. After the bell, Hewlett-Packard Co shares fell 0.7 percent following the computing company’s results. Hewlett-Packard reported an increase in quarterly revenue, surprising analysts. During the regular session, Home Depot was the Dow’s biggest percentage gainer. Shares of the world’s largest home improvement retailer rose 2.9 percent to a record closing high of $90.75 a day after Home Depot’s earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations. The stock also set an all-time intraday high on Wednesday of $91.07. Lowe’s Cos Inc, a rival of Home Depot, rebounded. The stock gained 1.6 percent to close at $52.33 after setting an intraday record high of $52.65. At one point, Lowe’s stock fell as low as $49.71 after the home improvement products retailer reported better-than-expected quarterly results but cut its full-year forecast. The S&P; retail index ended up 1.1 percent, marking its fifth gain in six sessions despite tepid results from some major retailers. Shares of Target Corp rose 1.8 percent to $60.33, shaking off initial declines after the U.S. discount retailer’s second-quarter earnings fell shy of analysts’ estimates. The company cut its full-year outlook. American Eagle Outfitters was a bright spot in the retail sector after the teen-oriented chain’s second-quarter results beat expectations and forecasts for third-quarter earnings were in line with the current estimate. Its stock jumped 12 percent to $12.98. About 4.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the five-day average of 5.2 billion.

The minutes came after a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in July, where the Fed trimmed its monthly bond-buying program by an additional $10 billion. Stocks were mixed, with the S&P; 500 within 8 points of its all-time high and the Nasdaq Composite slightly retreating from gains earlier in the day. “I don’t think there were really any surprises in the minutes, or that the markets are reacting meaningfully to them,” said Carin Pai, executive vice president and director of equity management at Fiduciary Trust in New York. Investors are more concerned with the upcoming annual meeting of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that will take place from Thursday through Saturday, Pai said. There, Yellen is expected to acknowledge that while economic data has generally been supportive, she remains concerned about the labor market. “There’s going to be a little more color coming out Friday,” Pai said. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.9 points, or 0.15 percent, to 16,944.49. The S&P; 500 was up 1.14 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,982.74. The Nasdaq Composite  fell 4.68 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,522.83. Lowe’s Cos Inc was up 2.2 percent at $52.64, rebounding from a session low of $49.71. The world’s No. 2 home improvement products retailer reported better-than-expected second-quarter results but cut its full-year sales forecast. Fellow retailer Target Corp rose 2.5 percent to $60.72, shaking off initial declines after second-quarter earnings fell shy of analysts’ estimates and the company cut its full-year outlook. Despite some tepid numbers from retailers, the S&P; retail index gained 1.1 percent and was on track for its fifth gain in six sessions. Lowe’s and Target have “specific issues as opposed to representing what is going on in the broader retail market,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. American Eagle Outfitters was a bright spot in the retail sector after second-quarter results beat expectations and it forecast third-quarter earnings in line with the current estimate. Its shares jumped 10.8 percent to $12.84. On the downside, Hertz Global Holdings tumbled 9.9 percent to $28.43. The rental car company withdrew its full-year financial forecast and said it expects 2014 results “well below” its previous guidance due to business challenges and costs.

136,LOW,Lowe's expects pickup in home improvement spending,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), the No. 2 U.S. home improvement products retailer, echoed larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in anticipating higher spending on renovations in the second half of the year as the U.S. housing market showed signs of a recovery. Lowe’s said it expects higher demand for products such as electronic appliances, fashion fixtures and flooring as people spruce up their homes ahead of the holidays. “Consumers are indicating stronger intentions to complete a home-improvement project, with most of them planning a specific project in the next three months,” Lowe’s Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call with analysts. Home Depot on Tuesday maintained its full-year sales growth forecast of about 4.8 percent, but said it expected same-store sales to grow faster in the second half as customers renovate homes with big-ticket purchases.  U.S. housing starts rebounded strongly in July, Commerce Department data showed on Tuesday, signaling that the housing market is regaining its footing after being hurt by last year’s run-up in interest rates.  Lowe’s, however, on Wednesday cut its sales growth forecast to about 4.5 percent from about 5 percent for the year ending January, unable to make up for the sales missed during the prolonged North American winter.  “... First and second quarter together, we are still slightly short of where we’d anticipated being this time of the year,” Niblock told Reuters. Lowe’s also lowered its same-store sales growth forecast for the year by half a percentage point to about 3.5 percent. “It was quite evident after the first quarter that the guidance was hopelessly optimistic,” Rahul Sharma, managing director at Neev Capital, told Reuters. “They assumed too much acceleration.” Sharma said wage inflation among the more skilled job categories and the “general wealth effect” on those invested in equities and similar products were making the higher-income consumer a spending “sweet spot.” But lower and middle-income consumers are reining in spending on food and other essentials, forcing Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and dollar stores to discount more.  BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED SECOND QUARTER  Lowe’s maintained its full-year profit forecast of about $2.63 per share.  The company said it recovered “most of the outdoor product sales” it had missed due to a severe winter but said sales of discretionary interior products, such as window air conditioners, were fewer than expected in the second quarter due to a cooler summer. Lowe’s same-store sales rose 4.4 percent in the second quarter. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected a rise of 4.1 percent. Net income rose 10.5 percent to $1.04 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the quarter ended Aug. 1. Revenue rose 5.6 percent to $16.59 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.02 per share on revenue of $16.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lowe’s shares were nearly flat at $51.70 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as much as 3.5 percent in early trading.

Investors will peruse the Fed minutes, which will be released at 2:00 p.m. (1800 GMT), for clues on how soon the central bank plans to hike interest rates. At a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in July, the Fed had trimmed its monthly bond-buying program by an additional $10 billion. An annual meeting of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from Thursday through Saturday, will also be eyed for possible insight into the path for U.S. monetary policy. “We know what is going to happen this year, we are looking into next year and for that we need the sort of stuff that comes out of this conference,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. The benchmark S&P; 500 is less than 0.4 percent from its  all-time intraday high of 1,991.39 reached on July 24.

Fellow retailer Target Corp rose 1 percent to $59.84, shaking off initial declines after second-quarter earnings fell shy of analysts’ estimates and the company cut its full-year outlook. The S&P; retail index gained 0.5 percent and was on track for its fifth gain in six sessions. Lowe’s and Target “are companies with specific issues as opposed to representing what is going on in the broader retail market,” Forrest said. “(Target) has a path out of it, they’ve changed the leadership that brought these results and Wall Street is always willing to overlook someone else’s results.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.15 points or 0.19 percent, to 16,951.74, the S&P; 500 gained 2.33 points or 0.12 percent, to 1,983.93 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 1.14 points or 0.03 percent, to 4,528.65.

Minutes of the U.S. central bank’s Oct. 28-29 meeting, where policymakers decided to finally end their bond-buying stimulus, indicated a debate among policymakers over the outlook for inflation and the economy. Following the release of the minutes, U.S. short-term interest-rate futures traders were still betting on a first Fed rate hike by September next year. “The market is yawning ... The Fed minutes did nothing to change the conversation,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. Tech names were among the biggest drags on the market, with shares of Microsoft down 1.3 percent, weighing on both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq, and shares of Qualcomm down 2.1 percent.

148,LOW,"Lowe's raises fiscal-year profit, sales forecasts","(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), the No. 2 U.S. home improvement chain, on Wednesday raised its fiscal-year profit and sales forecasts as an improving job market encourages home owners to increase spending on renovations. The company, whose shares rose more than 5 percent, also reported higher-than-expected quarterly results.  Sales have been recovering after a severe winter earlier this year hit demand for outdoor products such as roofing and tiling materials. “Now more than any time since 2006, (home owners) are looking to invest in their houses, and while most projects are small-ticket, we are seeing a rise in big-ticket projects,” Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said on a conference call. Rival Home Depot (HD.N) on Tuesday reported slightly higher-than-expected quarterly sales, but earnings came in just below Wall Street estimates.   Lowe’s raised its full-year profit forecast to $2.68 per share from $2.63. Analysts on average were expecting $2.63, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also said it expected sales growth of 4.5 percent to 5 percent for the year ending on Jan. 30, compared with a prior outlook of 4.5 percent. The new sales forecast translates to $55.82 billion to $56.09 billion. Wall Street was expecting $55.78 billion. The company is making progress in expanding its retail offerings, including online, and in efforts to cut costs and close unproductive stores, but the benefits are yet not fully visible, Janney Capital Markets said in a note.  “(This) keeps us neutral on the story,” the note said. Lowe’s also said it now expected sales at stores open at least a year to increase 3.5 percent to 4 percent this year. It had previously forecast a 3.5 percent rise.  Same-store sales increased 5.1 percent in the third quarter ended Oct. 31, higher than the 4 percent analysts expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Net income jumped 17 percent to $585 million, or 59 cents per share. Revenue increased 5.6 percent to $13.68 billion. Analysts had expected a profit of 58 cents per share on revenue of $13.55 billion.

153,LOW,Fitch Solutions: Lowe's CDS at Tightest Levels Since 2007,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 02 (Fitch) Amid slumping retail sales overall, Lowe’s  Companies Inc. is emerging as a bright spot as evidenced by its tightening  credit default swap (CDS) spreads, according to Fitch Solutions in its latest  CDS Case Study Snapshot. Five-year CDS on Lowe’s tightened 28% over the past month to price at the  tightest levels in seven years. After pricing at ‘AA+’ levels for much of the  past year, credit protection on Lowe’s debt is now pricing in ‘AAA’ space. ‘Improved investor confidence for Lowe’s can likely be attributed to strong  fiscal third quarter results and slightly higher full-year guidance thanks to  more home improvement spending overall,’ said Director Diana Allmendinger.  Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings’ Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

156,LOW,Amazon.com expands into professional services with home marketplace,"CHICAGO, March 30 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is launching a home services marketplace that will connect customers with electricians, plumbers and painters in a move to have its services tied to every product sold on its website. Amazon Home Services, which will launch on Monday, will allow customers to buy 700 services such as car maintenance, TV wall-mounting and house cleaning at upfront prices. The quality of the service will be backed with an Amazon guarantee, which the retailer uses to vouch for products sold by third-party sellers on its website. A home services marketplace will extend Amazon’s role as a middleman for third-party vendors, which account for about 40 percent of its sales. It would also help Amazon gain an edge in the fast-growing services industry in the U.S. which the retailer estimates to be around $630 billion. “Third party estimates show that customers spend four times more on services each year than they do on physical products,” Peter Faricy, vice-president, Amazon Marketplace told Reuters. “So for us the opportunity is very big,” he said. Around 85 million Amazon shoppers buy products that require servicing or installation, the company said. Amazon will roll out the service nationwide with “high coverage” in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. Services marks a new frontier for Amazon, which has focused on selling products as it expanded from books into consumer goods, groceries and media. Local services have been tough for marketplace companies to turn a profit, since offerings must be tailored to each city or region. Amazon will be in direct competition with Angie’s List Inc , Craigslist Inc, and Yelp Inc as well as U.S. home improvement chains like Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Companies Inc, which have invested in ways to link customers with local plumbers, painters and other service providers. Amazon will hand pick service professionals after running background checks and offer to match prices if customers get a lower price for the same service and professional on another site, store or directly from the professional within 30 days of a purchase, Faricy said. Amazon Home Services will have a revenue share model with the service providers. The retailer will charge a 5 percent transaction fee, along with platform fees ranging from 10 percent for custom services and 15 percent for standardized services.

157,LOW,"Lowe's misses on profit; says harsh winter hurt promotions, sales","(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), the No.2 U.S. home improvement chain by sales, reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday as a long, harsh winter hurt sales growth, sending its shares down more than 5 percent. Lowe’s performance during the first quarter is in sharp contrast to bigger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) whose earnings handily beat analyst estimates on Tuesday as the company benefited from higher spending on home improvement after a severe winter. Explaining why Lowe’s sales were held back during the quarter, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said the company did not anticipate the winter to be as long as it was and some of its spring promotions in stores were offered later than usual. “Our Spring Black Friday promotions in the Northeast fell under the second quarter because we felt that would give better returns on investment in advertising and marketing,” Niblock said in an interview.

Lowe’s performance during the first quarter is in sharp contrast to bigger rival Home Depot Inc whose earnings handily beat analyst estimates on Tuesday as the company benefited from higher spending on home improvement after a severe winter. Explaining why Lowe’s sales were held back during the quarter, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said the company did not anticipate the winter to be as long as it was and some of its spring promotions in stores were offered later than usual. “Our Spring Black Friday promotions in the Northeast fell under the second quarter because we felt that would give better returns on investment in advertising and marketing,” Niblock said in an interview.

Most U.S. Treasuries prices were higher, with yields hitting a session high, as concerns about Greece’s ability to meet its debt payments renewed safe-haven demand for bonds ahead of the release of details of the Fed’s meeting. The minutes of meeting are due at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). The central bank has said it will raise rates only when data suggests that the economy is strengthening. Growth slowed to a crawl in the first quarter. Recent data has painted a mixed picture. Consumption, business spending and manufacturing data has suggested the economy is struggling, but housing starts were strong. While the Fed is broadly expected to raise rates this year, the timing of the move has kept the market on tenterhooks. “There is a consensus that the Fed probably doesn’t move until September and I don’t think that will change today,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. The latest Reuters survey showed most economists were now less convinced about when rates would be increased, but the median still suggested a move in the third quarter. A rate hike is not likely to be appropriate until early 2016, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Wednesday. At 9:43 a.m. ET (1343 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 25.05 points, or 0.14 percent, at 18,287.34, the S&P; 500 was down 4.59 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,123.24 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 16.26 points, or 0.32 percent, at 5,053.78. Eight of the 10 major S&P; 500 indexes were lower. The industrials index fell 0.44 percent as Southwest Airlines led a drop in airline stocks. Southwest fell 6 percent to $38.33 after it forecast a decline in passenger revenue per available seat mile for the quarter. Yahoo Inc gained 3.7 percent to $42.60 after the company said a potential change in tax rules on spinoffs was not specific to its plan to spin off its stake in Alibaba. The stock fell 7.6 percent on Tuesday. Target rose 0.8 percent to $78.53 after it reported a larger-than-expected increase in profit and raised the lower end of its full-year earnings forecast range. Lowe’s fell 5 percent to $68.22 after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly profit and sales. Etsy slumped 21.5 percent to $16.50 after posting a bigger loss in its first report as a public company. Pep Boys Manny Moe and Jack rose 12 percent to $10.35 on a report that the auto parts retailer had received takeover approaches. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,412 to 1,229, for a 1.15-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,362 issues fell and 846 advanced for a 1.61-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P; 500 index posted 9 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 21 new lows.

Lowe’s missed earnings estimates during the first quarter, which is typically driven by promotions for home retailers, sending its shares down over 5 percent on Wednesday. A day earlier Home Depot topped expectations. Lowe’s comparable sales underperformed that of Home Depot in two out of the three months in the first quarter. The second-largest home improvement chain had lower exposure to the Northeastern states, which were battered by winter storms and blizzards leading to widespread economic damage. Home Depot capitalized on the storms and the winter months with better-timed promotions and saw its sales and profit beat expectations as customers spent more on home repairs after a harsh winter.   The two companies dominate the home improvement market and are seen as leading indicators for the health and revival of the U.S housing market. “Home Depot did a pretty good job in offering quick promotions to stimulate people into buying during the winter months whereas Lowe’s clearly lost momentum there,” said Neil Saunders, chief executive at research firm Conlumino. Explaining why Lowe’s sales were held back during the quarter, Lowe’s Chief Executive Robert Niblock told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that some of the company’s spring promotions in stores were offered later than usual.

163,LOW,UPDATE 1-Amazon expands home services marketplace in U.S. cities,"(Adds details on home services marketplace, company background) SEATTLE, July 22 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Wednesday it would expand a marketplace that offers home services from plumbing to fence repairs in 15 U.S. cities and help customers find contractors for more expensive home projects as it develops its role as a middle man for third-party vendors. The e-commerce company said it now offers more than 15 million unique services through its home services marketplace, up from 2 million when it launched in March. The home services platform is an ambitious frontier for Amazon, pitting it against consumer review sites Yelp Inc  and Angie’s List Inc as well as U.S. home improvement chains Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Companies Inc, which have both invested in ways to link customers with service providers. “We have seen an incredible surge in applications from providers to be part of the platform since our launch and that’s what has allowed us to expand so rapidly,” Nish Lathia, general manager of Amazon Home Services, told Reuters. “Our plan is to add more services and locations,” said Lathia. Amazon said the website was focused for now on the home but could eventually offer a wider variety of services. Customers can already order piano lessons and find car mechanics on Amazon’s site. Lathia said the home services site was predominantly used by members of Amazon Prime, the online retailer’s premium membership service. The company believes there is universal demand for reliable referrals for home improvement and other services, but declined to give specifics on the possibility of expanding the marketplace abroad. Amazon will offer its home services to customers in 15 metropolitan areas including Chicago, Houston and Miami after applications from plumbers, electricians and other service providers wanting to list on the marketplace quadrupled since it launched in March. It declined to disclose the number of service providers currently available. Customers can select a variety of services such as plumbing and TV installation and see recommended local contractors and pricing. Now customers will also be able to request referrals for specialized and more complex projects such as installing air conditioning, Amazon said. The company charges a 10 to 20 percent referral fee to contractors and provides customer support and refunds if there is any dissatisfaction with the service. Amazon said it screens service providers and individual contractors thoroughly and less than 3 percent of applicants normally get through the vetting process.

The company’s same-store sales rose 4.3 percent in the second quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of 3.9 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) also reported a stronger-than-expected rise in quarterly same-store sales on Tuesday, helped by increased home remodeling activity and a recovery in the housing market.   “Economists are forecasting a modest acceleration in both incomes and consumer spending this year and recovery in the housing market continues,” Lowe’s Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call on Wednesday. U.S. homebuilder sentiment rose in August to its highest level in almost a decade, the National Association of Home Builders said on Monday. Lowe’s sells items such as refrigerators, dishwashers and washing machines in its kitchens and appliances category, its biggest by sales. Its outdoor power equipment category includes chainsaws, branch trimmers and generators. The company offered more promotions on appliances to beat fierce competition. This hurt its gross margins to some extent, Chief Operating Officer Rick Damron said. Demand was low for exterior improvement items such as paint due to heavy rain in parts of the United States, Lowe’s said.

Net income rose 8.7 percent to $1.13 billion, or $1.20 per share, but missed analysts’ expectation of $1.24 per share, mainly due to a higher tax rate and a rise in selling and general expenses. Unlike Home Depot, which raised its full-year profit and sales forecasts, Lowe’s maintained its forecast of a profit of about $3.29 per share, sales growth of 4.5-5.0 percent and same-store sales growth of 4.0-4.5 percent for the year ending January.

171,LOW,Lowe's sales top estimates amid strengthening U.S. housing market,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) followed larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit and same-store sales, and the company said it expects higher spending on home improvement to continue until 2017 at least. Strong results from the top two U.S. home improvement chains are in contrast to those from department store operators Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N), which cast a pall over the retail industry ahead of the holiday shopping season. The S&P; 500 retail index .SPXRT has fallen 4 percent  since Macy’s reported results on Nov. 11. Shares of Home Depot and Lowe’s have also been volatile in the past week because of the negative sentiment surrounding retailers. Consumers have spent more on houses, home improvement products, appliances and eating out than on apparel and accessories in the August-October quarter. Key drivers of home improvement spending in the quarter were increased disposable personal income and higher demand for houses, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call. The U.S. housing recovery has been gaining traction, with soaring demand for rental apartments boosting housing starts in September. However, U.S. housing starts in October fell to a seven-month low as single-family home construction in the South tumbled, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Shares of Lowe’s and Home Depot were down about 1 pct on Wednesday.  “There are a number of factors that can always impact the market. It could be the numbers... housing starts ...could have an impact,” Niblock told Reuters.     Lowe’s maintained its profit and same-store sales growth forecasts for the year ending January, while Home Depot said it expects full-year profit and same-store sales to be at the top end of its forecast. Niblock said the higher spending on home improvement was built into Lowe’s forecasts. Lowe’s seasonal living business, which sells items such as air conditioners, garden decor and patio furniture, did well as customers spent more time outside due to the warmer-than-usual weather in the quarter, the company said. Sales of appliances and tools and hardware were also above average in the quarter, the company said.        Increase in both the number of transactions and their average value helped same-store sales rise 4.6 percent. Comparable sales in its U.S. home improvement business increased 5 percent. Lowe’s net income rose 26 percent to $736 million, or 80 cents per share. Net sales rose 5 percent to $14.36 billion, slightly above analysts’ average estimate.

Strong results from the top two U.S. home improvement chains are in contrast to those from department store operators Macy’s Inc and Nordstrom Inc, which cast a pall over the retail industry ahead of the holiday shopping season. The S&P; 500 retail index has fallen 4 percent  since Macy’s reported results on Nov. 11. Shares of Home Depot and Lowe’s have also been volatile in the past week because of the negative sentiment surrounding retailers. Consumers have spent more on houses, home improvement products, appliances and eating out than on apparel and accessories in the August-October quarter. Key drivers of home improvement spending in the quarter were increased disposable personal income and higher demand for houses, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call.

174,LOW,Lowe's wins over Canada's Rona with renewed takeover offer,"(Reuters) - U.S. home improvement retailer Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) agreed to buy Canada’s Rona Inc RON.TO for C$3.2 billion ($2.28 billion), winning over Rona’s board with a far higher offer than an unsolicited bid more than three years ago that was opposed by the company and Quebec politicians. The deal will put Lowe’s in a stronger position to compete with Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in Canada’s more-than $30 billion home improvement market. Lowe’s, which withdrew a C$1.8 billion offer for Rona in September 2012, said on Wednesday it had made key commitments, including moving the headquarters of its Canadian business from Toronto to Rona’s home base in the Montreal suburb of Boucherville, Quebec. It also said it would retain the vast majority of Rona’s employees, keep the brand and ramp up distribution to independent dealers, many of whom had opposed the previous deal. Lowe’s previous attempt to take over Rona became a hot-button issue in Quebec. Quebec’s economic development minister said it would not be in the interest of the Liberal government to block the new deal, despite a call from the opposition Parti Québécois to reject it. Asked on a call with analysts why Lowe’s had made a new offer, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said Rona was “a much better business today.” After years of disappointing sales, Rona has been closing unprofitable stores and generally streamlining operations under Chief Executive Robert Sawyer. Sales at established stores have risen five quarters in a row. Lowe’s push into Canada comes a year after Target Corp (TGT.N) exited the country after less than two years due to supply chain and other issues. The big difference is that Lowe’s is buying an established business, while Target was largely starting from scratch. Lowe’s, the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain, had only 40 of its 1,850 North America stores in Canada as of March. Rona has about 700 stores. Home Depot has 182 Canadian stores, its website shows. Lowe’s will pay C$24 per share for Rona’s common shares - more than double the stock’s close on Tuesday. Rona’s largest shareholder, Quebec public pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, said it would accept the offer. The Caisse holds about 17 percent of Rona, Thomson Reuters data shows. BMO Capital Markets analyst Peter Sklar said the deal would likely win regulatory approval. Rona’s shares were trading as high as $C23.57 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, their highest since July 2007. Lowe’s shares were down nearly 8 percent at $66.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

178,LOW,Lowe's higher sales overshadowed by Home Depot hangover,"(Reuters) - Home improvement chain Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported an increase in quarterly comparable sales that paled in comparison to those of rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N), despite beating Wall Street expectations. Shares of Lowe’s fell as much as 4.5 percent on Wednesday. Home Depot was off about 1 percent amid declines in the broader market. Home Depot and Lowe’s are benefiting from pent-up demand for houses in the United States after the 2008 financial crisis, while low interest rates and growth in jobs, wages and credit have spurred spending on big-ticket projects such as home remodeling. Although fourth-quarter sales at Lowe’s U.S. stores open for more than a year rose a healthy 5.5 percent, the increase was less than the 8.9 percent reported by Home Depot a day earlier.  Lowe’s also said on Wednesday that it expected 2016 sales to rise 6 percent, higher than the 4.8 percent that analysts were expecting and matching Home Depot’s forecast. “As good as (Lowe’s) numbers are, comparisons will inevitably be drawn with Home Depot’s much stronger results,” said Hakon Helgesen, analyst at research firm Conlumino. “This takes the shine off (Lowe’s) figures as it indicates that Home Depot is adding market share at a faster pace than Lowe’s.” Besides an improving housing market, unseasonably warm weather in the holiday quarter encouraged customers to continue outdoor activities and home renovations for longer than usual. Analysts say Home Depot, which operates 2,274 stores worldwide compared with Lowe’s 1,857 stores, enjoys a stronger brand image and remains more of a “go-to” destination for renovation items.  For example, kitchen products, typically a big ticket item, performed well for Home Depot during the quarter, but for Lowe’s the business was “below average”. Chief Executive Robert Niblock blamed that weakness on a shift in marketing strategy that pulled promotions into October, instead of their usual start in November. Overall, Lowe’s same-store sales rose a better-than-expected 5.2 percent in the three months ended Jan. 29. The company’s net earnings plunged to $11 million from $450 million, hurt by a $530 million impairment charge related to its exit from a joint venture in Australia. Excluding items, it earned 59 cents per share, in-line with Wall Street’s expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 5.6 percent to $13.24 billion, beat analysts’ estimates of $13.07 billion. Lowe’s shares were down 2.4 percent at $66.27 in late morning trading.

The accord resolves Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims that Lowe’s violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by terminating employees whose medical leaves of absence exceeded the company’s 180- or 240-day maximum leave policy. A consent decree detailing the settlement was approved on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Andre Birotte in Los Angeles.

The Mooresville, North Carolina-based company also agreed to improve employee training. Lowe’s denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. The decree lasts for four years.

Shares of the home improvement chain, which also raised its profit forecast for the year ending Feb. 3, rose as much as 4 percent to a record high of $79.08, boosting the company’s market value by about $2.5 billion. In contrast, Home Depot’s shares fell as much as 3 percent after reporting results on Tuesday, as investors viewed the stock as fairly valued following a more than 19 percent gain in the 12 months to Monday’s close. Lowe’s stock rose only 5 percent in the period.  Investors had been relatively negative on Lowe’s stock prior to the earnings and the stock was “cheap” compared to the past three years, J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote. The outlook for the home-improvement industry remained positive for the rest of the year as gains in the job market and disposable income drive consumer spending, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call on Wednesday. U.S. housing starts rose a stronger-than-expected 6.6 percent in April, data showed on Tuesday. Rising home prices were also encouraging consumers to invest in their houses, Niblock added. “The home improvement industry once again shows its resilient nature in an increasingly more difficult environment for retailers,” Horvers wrote. Retailers such as Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) reported quarterly sales that missed Wall Street’s estimates as consumer spending shifts away from apparel and accessories to big-ticket items including cars and homes. Separately, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman reached a settlement with Lowe’s and Home Depot over alleged violations of a 2010 state law designed to reduce water pollution. The attorney general alleged that 90 percent of Home Depot and Lowe’s stores in New York violated the law by displaying phosphorus-containing lawn fertilizers without the required signage or failing to separate phosphorus-containing fertilizers from those without it. Lowe’s agreed to pay $52,000 and Home Depot $78,000 in fines. Lowe’s told Reuters that most of its fertilizers did not contain phosphorous and that its signage complied with the law. The company, however, agreed to settle to avoid lengthy litigation.  SAME-STORE SALES BEAT  Lowe’s raised its full-year profit forecast to about $4.11 per share from about $4.00. The company’s same-store sales rose 7.3 percent in the first quarter, handily beating the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.    The jump also outpaced the 6.5 percent rise reported by Home Depot, only the second time Lowe’s has outpaced its rival in nearly seven years.   The rise in Lowe’s same-store sales increase also handily beat the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.   Mild weather in February helped drive outdoor construction projects, boosting demand for lumber, building materials and millwork, the company said. Excluding items, Lowe’s earned 87 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Separately, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman reached a settlement with Lowe’s and Home Depot over alleged violations of a 2010 state law designed to reduce water pollution. The attorney general alleged that 90 percent of Home Depot and Lowe’s stores in New York violated the law by displaying phosphorus-containing lawn fertilizers without the required signage or failing to separate phosphorus-containing fertilizers from those without it. Lowe’s agreed to pay $52,000 and Home Depot $78,000 in fines. Lowe’s told Reuters that most of its fertilizers did not contain phosphorous and that its signage complied with the law. The company, however, agreed to settle to avoid lengthy litigation.  SAME-STORE SALES BEAT  Lowe’s raised its full-year profit forecast to about $4.11 per share from about $4.00. The company’s same-store sales rose 7.3 percent in the first quarter, handily beating the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.    The jump also outpaced the 6.5 percent rise reported by Home Depot, only the second time Lowe’s has outpaced its rival in nearly seven years.   The rise in Lowe’s same-store sales increase also handily beat the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.   Mild weather in February helped drive outdoor construction projects, boosting demand for lumber, building materials and millwork, the company said. Excluding items, Lowe’s earned 87 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 7.8 percent to $15.23 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of $14.87 billion.

194,LOW,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Lowe's sales beat estimates as housing market strengthens,"(Corrects paragraph 2 to say Lowe’s fiscal year will end on Feb. 3, not January. The error also appeared in an earlier version) * Q1 adj EPS $0.87 vs est $0.85 * Net sales jump 7.8 pct to $15.23 bln vs est $14.87 bln * Same-store sales rise 7.3 pct vs est 4.3 pct * Shares gain as much as 3 pct premarket May 18 (Reuters) - Home improvement chain Lowe’s Cos Inc  followed larger rival Home Depot Inc in reporting better-than-expected quarterly sales as strength in the U.S. housing market and favorable weather led to strong demand for building and home renovation products. Shares of the company, which also raised its profit forecast for the year ending Feb. 3, 2017, rose as much as 3 percent to $78.85 in premarket trading on Wednesday. They later pared some gains to trade up 1 percent. Results from the home improvement chains stand in stark contrast to grim quarterly reports from retailers such as Macy’s Inc as consumer spending shifts away from apparel and accessories to big-ticket items including cars and homes. “The home improvement industry once again shows its resilient nature in an increasingly more difficult environment for retailers,” J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote in a note. The pullback in gas prices has seemingly intensified the willingness to invest in homes, he said. U.S. housing starts rose a stronger-than-expected 6.6 percent in April, data showed on Tuesday. Housing starts hit their highest level in five months in February, before falling more than expected in March. Lowe’s raised its full-year profit forecast to about $4.11 per share from about $4. The forecast excludes the impact of its C$3.2 billion ($2.28 billion) acquisition of Canada’s Rona Inc, which the company expects to close on May 20. Sales at stores open more than 13 months rose 7.3 percent, well above the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Lowe’s net income rose to $884 million, or 98 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 29, from $673 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain on a foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of the pending acquisition of Rona, the company earned 87 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 7.8 percent to $15.23 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $14.87 billion. Up to Tuesday’s close, the stock had risen 4.2 percent in the past year, underperforming Home Depot’s 15.5 percent gain during the same period.

199,LOW,Lowe's sales miss estimates as short spring hurts,"(Reuters) - Home improvement chain Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its full-year earnings forecast, hurt by a shorter spring in the northern United States and fewer big-ticket purchases at its stores. Lowe’s shares were down 6.8 percent in late morning trading on Wednesday. While Home Depot’s sales got a big boost from big-ticket items such as appliances and roofing products, Lowe’s reported average sales.

204,LOW,Lowe's says Woolworths voted to end JV without consent -court filing,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - U.S. home improvement chain Lowe’s Companies Inc has begun legal proceedings against Australian retailer Woolworths Ltd for allegedly voting to end a joint venture without mutual consent, in violation of their partnership agreement. The court filing comes after Woolworths last week said it would exit the home improvement business, earning A$1.5 billion  ($1.14 billion) in gross proceeds via contracts that included the closure their Masters Home Improvement chain joint venture. It was unclear what resolution Lowe’s is seeking through the filing. Woolworths on Monday said it was aware of the filing and that it had not been served with any related documents. The retailer declined to comment further when contacted on Tuesday. Lowe’s did not respond to a request for comment outside of regular U.S. business hours. A lawyer in Sydney representing Lowe’s declined to comment. In documents filed at Sydney’s Federal Court, Lowe’s said Woolworths gave its representatives insufficient time to review voluminous paperwork related to the closure, and that Woolworths voted for the closure without those representatives’ consent. It said Woolworths supplied paperwork 24 hours before board meetings on Aug. 23 and 24 that each exceeded 1,000 pages. Woolworths held the vote on Aug. 24, a day before reporting earnings for 2015, Lowe’s said in the filing. The retailer booked a record loss, which included more than $2 billion worth of writedowns in its hardware business. The pair launched the venture in 2011 to compete with the Bunnings chain of Woolworths rival Wesfarmers Ltd, with Lowe’s owning a third. Woolworths on Jan. 18 said, on terminating the venture, it would be obliged to pay Lowe’s the fair value of its stake. Neither party has announced any agreed value in the interim. A case management hearing has been scheduled for Wednesday.

222,LOW,Lowe's shares could rise 20 percent on strong outlook: Barron's,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of home improvement retailer Lowe’s Companies Inc (LOW.N) could rise by 20 percent or more, helped by better projected earnings growth this year and greater room for margin improvement, Barron’s said on Sunday. Companies such as Lowe’s and Home Depot Inc (HD.N) are uniquely positioned due to their strong outlook, as a healthy economy and improving real estate markets in most of the United States encourages homeowners to undertake renovation, Barron’s said. These companies are also “Amazon proof”, the report said, noting that home improvement was low on the list of categories the retailer is expected to penetrate.  U.S. retail heavyweights including Target Corp (TGT.N), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Kroger Co (KR.N) have been locked in a fierce battle against Amazon Inc (AMZN.O). While both Home Depot and Lowe’s are poised for growth, Lowe’s could be more attractive now, due in part to its lower price-to-earnings ratio, the report said.  Lowe’s shares trade at $82, or about 18 times projected earnings of $4.63 per share for year ending January 2018, while Home Depot trades at $147, or 20.4 times estimated earnings of $7.19 per share in its current year, Barron’s said.  Lowe’s same-store sales performance has lagged Home Depot’s the past several quarters, mainly due to its focus on do-it-yourself customers who spend less on big-ticket items than professionals.  However, the retailer is taking steps to boost per-store revenue, which would help narrow the valuation gap, Barron’s said.  Lowe’s offers investors exposure to one of retail’s strongest sectors, the potential for 15 percent annual earnings growth and a “shareholder friendly” management, according to the report.

Fed funds futures show that traders now see a 75 percent chance that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates in June. The minutes will be released at 2 p.m. ET (1600 GMT). Investors are also awaiting more details regarding the Fed trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. “Our U.S. economists expect the minutes to come down on the hawkish side and continue to expect the Fed to hike in June and September and announce balance sheet reduction in December,” Citi analysts wrote on Wednesday. While recent economic data has been mixed, with signs of a dip in consumer sentiment and spending, the job market continues to strengthen. That could give the Fed impetus to continue with its path of monetary tightening. The tightening labor market and historically low mortgage rates have helped the housing market recovery. Amid a raft of housing data due is a report that is expected to show existing home sales fell in April, compared with March. At 9:40 a.m. ET (1340 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.52 points, or 0.02 percent, at 20,942.43, the S&P; 500 was up 1.28 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,399.7 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.17 points, or 0.1 percent, at 6,144.88. Eight of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, led by the utilities index’s 0.49 percent rise. The laggard again was the consumer staples index, down 0.2 percent after a weak report from Lowe’s, the No. 2 U.S. home improvement chain. Lowe’s fell 3.6 percent to $79.36 and was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 after it reported a lower-than-expected profit and comparable sales. Bigger rival Home Depot was off 0.5 percent, weighing the most on the Dow. Jewelry retailer Tiffany fell 7.1 percent to $86.54 after posting a surprise drop in comparable sales. Intuit jumped 7.6 percent, the most on the S&P; 500, after raising its revenue forecast. Nvidia rose 2.3 percent to $140.25 on a report that SoftBank has built a $4 billion stake in the chipmaker. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,464 to 1,037. On the Nasdaq, 1,165 issues rose and 1,046 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 22 new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 36 new highs and 21 new lows.

232,LOW,"Lowe's misses earnings estimates, forecasts slower margins growth","(Reuters) - Lowe’s Companies Inc (LOW.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday and warned of slower growth in profit margins as it spends more on marketing and staffing to take advantage of a robust home improvement market. Shares of the No.2 U.S. home improvement retailer dipped 6 percent to $71.27 in morning trading. Demand for lumber, appliances and other products has soared as many homeowners increasingly prefer to remodel homes rather than buy a new house, because of an uptick in home prices. A shortage of properties, along with higher costs faced by homebuilders, has kept home prices elevated and sidelined first-time buyers. Lowe’s said it would increase staffing during weekends and other high-traffic periods to improve customer experience and drive sales. The retailer is also keeping seasonal employees it hired temporarily for spring. Lowe’s will also offer more promotions to woo professional contractors, a clientele with deeper pockets than the company’s long-established do-it-yourself customer base. In fact, Lowe’s bigger rival Home Depot Inc’s (HD.N) sharper focus on contractors has helped it fare better than Lowe’s in recent quarters. As a result of the increased spending, Lowe’s now expects its operating margin to rise 80 to 100 basis points in the year ending Feb. 2, down from an earlier forecast for a 120-basis-point increase. Lowe’s second-quarter earnings were dented by higher discounts as well as disruptions from changes made to its store staffing model, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a post-earnings call. “While Lowe’s is benefiting from the more buoyant demand from a strong housing market and stable economy, it still plays second fiddle to Home Depot - which remains more of a ‘go-to’ destination,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said. Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe’s marketing has been “slightly off-pitch” and has not resonated with consumers, Saunders said. Lowe’s net income rose 21.4 percent to $1.42 billion or $1.68 per share in the quarter ended Aug. 4. Excluding one-time items, it earned $1.57 per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of $1.61, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales climbed 6.8 percent to $19.50 billion but lagged analysts’ expectations of $19.53 billion. Sales at Lowe’s stores open for more than a year rose 4.5 percent, edging past the 4.3 percent expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. With Wednesday’s move, shares of Lowe’s are only slightly higher since the beginning of the year, lagging Home Depot’s 10 percent increase.

Harvey - the most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday - dumped more rain on Houston on Monday, worsening the flooding that has paralyzed the country’s fourth-largest city. U.S. crude futures dipped by more than 3 percent to $46.21 per barrel over concerns that the refinery shutdowns could reduce demand for American crude. The uncertainty pushed investors toward safe-haven assets, with gold rising to its highest in more than a week and U.S. Treasuries holding steady ahead of employment data on Friday. “What it tells you is a slight risk-off trade.

Flood damage from Harvey may equal that from 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, which resulted in more than $15 billion in flood insurance losses, according to an insurance research group.

Stocks of refiners, pipeline operators, insurers and home improvement retailers will be in focus after Harvey was set to dump more rain on Houston on Monday, worsening flooding that has paralyzed the country’s energy hub.

241,LOW,"UPDATE 1-Home Depot, Lowe's ship emergency material to Florida ahead of hurricane","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Home improvement retailers Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Inc said on Wednesday they have started shipping emergency material to Florida in anticipation of Hurricane Irma, even as they continue recovery efforts after Hurricane Harvey in Texas. Irma, which hit the Caribbean island of St. Martin on Wednesday, is expected to make landfall in Florida during the weekend but its precise trajectory remained uncertain. Irma could become the second powerful storm to thrash the U.S. mainland after Harvey killed more than 60 people and caused as much as $180 billion in damage after hitting Texas late last month. “This is unusual because we are now juggling two different storms in two different phases. One is approaching while the other market is in the recovery phase,” Home Depot spokesman Matthew Harrigan told Reuters. Home Depot is following the “same script” preparing for Irma as it did for Harvey. The retailer’s merchandising and supply chain teams have previously dealt with different weather-related disasters at once, Harrigan said without giving specific examples. Before Harvey hit Texas, the world’s largest hardware and home improvement chain activated its disaster-response plan, asked managers to freeze prices in stores around the region and move storm related merchandise to the front of the store. It followed a plan honed over many hurricane seasons to minimize disruptions, deliver essential material to affected areas and capitalize on a surge in demand for products once repairs begin. Home Depot said it takes up to two months to open stores that are hit hard by a hurricane. Stores that are minimally impacted are usually opened within a few days. Both Home Depot and Lowe’s had activated a hurricane command center during Harvey that is now continuing to monitor the path of Irma and mobilizing resources such as supplies. Home Depot said it has despatched 300 truckloads to Florida so far. Rival Lowe’s said it has sent 400 truckloads of hurricane prep material including flashlights, batteries and weather radios to Florida. Analysts have said investments in logistics and supply chain by home improvement chains during a weather-related disaster typically brings about 10 to 15 times more in sales. Shares of both Home Depot and Lowe’s traded up nearly 2 percent on Wednesday morning.

245,LOW,CORRECTED (OFFICIAL)-U.S. trucking firms predict tight capacity as loads head to storm zones,"(Reuters) - Major trucking and logistics firms like XPO Logistics Inc, Daseke Inc and United Parcel Service Inc said capacity will shrink due to a rush of construction and repair shipments to big-box retailers and households across the storm-crippled U.S. Southeast, as analysts warned of higher shipping prices. The demand for lumber, generators, cleaning supplies and appliances for households and home improvement retailers such as Lowe’s and Home Depot in Florida, Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas as a result of damages from Hurricane Irma will fill trailers and containers not already claimed by shipments for the holiday shopping season. “Already capacity was tightening. This magnified it,” XPO Chief Operating Officer Troy Cooper said in an interview. “I think we will see it continue to be tight as the recovery process comes on board. You will see that into early 2018.”  Tighter capacity means higher shipping prices for freight that is not already under longer-term contract, a revenue boost for trucking companies that could be partly offset by higher diesel prices and the cost of time spent navigating damaged roads. Prices were already rising due to freight demand as emergency relief transitions to rebuilding in the Houston area following Hurricane Harvey, IHS Markit researchers said on Wednesday.  “The impact is being felt nationwide,” IHS said. A dozen XPO less-than-truckload terminals in Florida have resumed taking shipments to destinations outside of Florida, such as Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina, Cooper said. But delivery and pickups in those markets, particularly in the “last mile” to households, remain limited by road closures, power outages and flooding, he said. However, no new full-truck shipments are coming into Florida as of Thursday morning, Cooper said.  “We are partnering with customers on relief loads and trying to set up a potential supply-chain opportunity with warehousing,” Cooper said.  Daseke, the largest owner of flatbed equipment in North America, moved freight out of likely disaster areas in advance of Irma and readied hundreds of shipments of goods such as wheelchairs, diapers, portable toilets, lumber and concrete, said Phil Byrd, chief executive officer of Daseke subsidiary Bulldog Hiway Express.  Those trucks already helped BMW keep its manufacturing line humming in Greer, South Carolina, this week, Byrd said. Drivers picked up three import containers stuck at the Charleston port because of delays on a Norfolk Southern railroad line and brought them directly to BMW’s plant, he said. YRC Worldwide Inc resumed limited operations in multiple Florida locations including Miami and Jacksonville, the company said on Wednesday.  Atlanta-based UPS has resumed package delivery, ground and air freight operations in all but three hard-hit locations -  Islamorada and Key West, Florida, and Brunswick, Georgia, said Mark Wallace, a UPS senior vice president. UPS used generators to re-open sorting and distribution facilities and routed shipments around flood zones. Drivers have started trying to deliver packages to debris-strewn neighborhoods in Orlando, Miami and Charleston. “If you think about how people are going to recover, they are going to recover by ordering and getting things delivered to their homes,” Wallace said. “It is a sign of getting people back to normalcy.”  (In paragraphs 7-8, corrects to show XPO not currently receiving full truckload shipments into Florida; in first paragraph, fixes typo) ",9142017,http://www.reuters.com/article/storm-irma-trucking/corrected-u-s-trucking-firms-predict-tight-capacity-as-loads-head-to-storm-zones-idUSL2N1LU1HZ

247,LOW,UPDATE 3-Lowe's beats on quarter but unchanged outlook pressures stock,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) on Tuesday beat quarterly estimates on higher demand for building materials after hurricanes in the United States but kept its full-year sales and profit outlook unchanged, sending its shares lower. Investors were hoping for stronger hurricane-related sales and were also concerned that Lowe’s was not keeping pace and closing the gap with bigger rival Home Depot (HD.N), which reported bumper results last week. “We would have hoped for a bit more of a closing of that gap in this quarter - didn’t quite get it... I think investors would like to see a bit more improvement in the next couple of quarters,” Mike Bailey​, ​director of research at FBB Capital Partners, a Lowe’s investor, said. Lowe’s shares, which have risen 15 percent this year, were down 0.6 percent at $80.99, even after beating Wall Street earnings per share estimates by 3 cents. “I know there was some impact on the stock price, I think there may be some focus with the analysts... with our earnings per share being a slight beat to their expectations for the quarter and not changing our guidance for the year,” Lowe’s Chief Executive Robert Niblock told Reuters. The No. 2 U.S. home improvement chain cited unpredictable weather in the fourth quarter for its tepid outlook. Lowe’s maintained its sales forecast for the fiscal year ending Feb. 2 to rise about 5 percent, comparable sales to grow 3.5 percent and earnings per share of $4.20-$4.30. Hurricane-related sales in the third quarter were about $200 million. Lowe’s expected this demand to continue in the fourth quarter and 2018. The retailer earned $1.05 per share, beating estimates of $1.02, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 6.6 percent and beat expectations of $16.59 billion. Niblock said comp sales growth of 5.7 percent, which beat estimates of 4.6 percent, was also helped by Lowe’s move to focus on professional contractors, a clientele with deeper pockets. Lowe’s has traditionally focused on do-it-yourself customers but is taking advantage of the prolonged housing recovery by offering more products and promotions geared toward those contractors. “We continue to build Pro (professional customer) awareness with targeted marketing as well as Pro exclusive offers to grow our share of wallet with existing Pros while also expanding our base of Pro customers,” COO Rick Damron said on a conference call. Lowe’s said Richard Maltsbarger, president of international business, would replace Damron, who retires on Feb. 3.

253,LOW,UPDATE 3-Lowe's nominates directors after 'constructive' talks with D.E. Shaw,"(Reuters) - Home improvement chain Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) said it has nominated two independent board members and plans to add a third following “constructive” talks with hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group, which has taken an activist stake, sending shares up 3 percent on Friday. D.E. Shaw has built a stake worth roughly $1 billion in the $84 billion company, according to a source familiar with the matter. Shaw has been concerned about Lowe’s operational performance in comparison with peers, the source added. Lowe’s same-store sales growth has lagged Home Depot’s (HD.N) for several years as it focuses more on do-it-yourself customers compared to its bigger rival’s focus on professional contractors who bill more. While Lowe’s stock jumped 30 percent last year, it underperformed Home Depot’s 41 percent rise. Lowe’s shares added $3.25 to $104.56 on Friday.  Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said Lowe’s valued the “constructive discussions” with Shaw. Shaw portfolio manager Quentin Koffey said the two new directors will be “significant assets to the board.” David Batchelder, co-founder of Relational Investors, and Lisa Wardell, CEO of Adtalem Global Education (ATGE.N), will join the board, Lowe’s said on Friday. The retailer will also nominate Brian Rogers, chairman of T. Rowe Price Group (TROW.O) and its former chief investment officer, for election to the board. Batchelder was recommended by D.E. Shaw, while Wardell and Rogers were the company’s candidates, a source close to the matter said. Batchelder had served on the board of Home Depot following a proxy fight in 2007 and helped push for a turnaround at the company.  The appointments of Batchelder, who will serve on the board’s compensation committee, and Wardell, who will sit on the audit committee, will be effective March 22. D.E. Shaw, best known as a quantitative hedge fund, started carving out an activist practice last year. Koffey joined the firm from Elliott Management about six months ago and was part of a campaign pushing for changes in EQT Corp’s (EQT.N) $6.7 billion to deal to buy Rice Energy Inc RICE.N.

258,LOW,Lowe's struggles as investments hit margins,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Companies Inc’s (LOW.N) quarterly profit and margins fell well short of Wall Street estimates on Wednesday as the No. 2 U.S. home improvement chain’s investments to convert shoppers’ visits into sales did not pay off as much as expected. The company’s shares tumbled 9 percent after Lowe’s forecast a drop in margins this year - due to heavy investment in a very competitive U.S. market.  A forecast that same-store sales growth would also slow this year suggested that investment would not bear fruit soon and left it trailing sector leader Home Depot. “We made an investment in the third quarter to bolster conversion rates ... we need to make the incremental investments to ensure that we convert that traffic into transactions,” Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said on a conference call. Despite a rise in store traffic, the number of customers making purchases dropped, and the purchases included expensive items with lower profit margins, such as lumber and washing machines. For investors, the benefit of higher same store sales were undermined by lower profit margins.  “Big ticket sales continued to be a driver of much of the top-line gains, with appliances coming at a double-digit pace and tickets over $500 rising at 5.5 percent,” Morningstar analyst Jamie Katz said.  “However, appliances tend to have lower gross margin than some other categories at the business, adding pressure to profitability.” The company’s gross margins fell to 33.73 percent, missing analysts estimates of 34.27 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company attributed sales of lower-margin products as well as money spent on initiatives such as advertising and home deliveries for the drop.  Operating margins also dropped and Lowe’s said it expected a drop of about 30 basis points this year. Same-store sales, however, rose 4.1 percent, topping market expectations. But that was well below the 7-percent growth posted by market-leader Home Depot Inc (HD.N), which also reported higher customer transactions and average spend. Lowe’s net sales fell nearly 2 percent to $15.49 billion, but topped estimates of $15.33 billion. Net income fell 12.5 percent to $554 million. Its adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share were well below analysts’ estimate of 87 cents. The results from the home improvement chain, which also owns Canadian home goods retailer Rona, come at a time when rising mortgage rates and the impact of the U.S. tax reforms on higher-priced homes have begun to worry investors in construction-related businesses. Lowe’s shares were down 6.3 percent at $89.81 in mid-day trading, easing from a session-low of $86.75. Both Lowe’s and Home Depot’s shares have risen about 28 percent in the past year.

263,LOW,"Home improvement chain Lowe's CEO to retire, shares rise","(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) on Monday said its chief executive officer is retiring, the latest executive departure as the home improvement chain tries to move out of the shadow of larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) that has outperformed it for years. Shares of Lowe’s rose as much as 7.8 percent to $90.33  after Robert Niblock said he would step down once a successor was found. The No. 2 U.S. home improvement store has struggled to control margin pressures and its same-store sales growth has trailed Home Depot’s for many years, weighed down by a focus on do-it-yourself customers compared to Home Depot’s core customer base of professional contractors who bill more. Lowe’s underperformance has also attracted shareholder activism.  Hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group secured two independent board seats after taking a nearly $1 billion stake and agitating for change. D.E. Shaw, best known as a quantitative hedge fund, started carving out an activist practice last year.  D.E. Shaw portfolio manager Quentin Koffey said in a statement that Niblock leaves the company in “excellent condition” to execute on value creation opportunities. In the past year, Lowe’s stock gained 1.7 percent, in contrast to Home Depot’s near 17 percent rise.    Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said, “a transition will be well received by investors, given their pent-up frustration with the company, and could be the first step toward improved operational execution.” Niblock’s departure follows the retirements of Chief Financial Officer Robert Hull and Chief Operating Officer Rick Damron over the past year. Lowe’s said its board has formed a six-person committee to find a successor, led by D.E. Shaw-backed director David Batchelder. “After a 25-year career at Lowe’s ... I am confident that it is the right time to transition the company to its next generation of leadership,” Niblock, who is also the chairman and president of the board, said in a statement.         Since Niblock took the top job at Lowe’s in January 2005, the company’s sales have risen 88 percent to $68.62 billion, while the stock has gained more than threefold.  Lowe’s shares closed 6.6 percent higher at $89.30. ",3262018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lowes-ceo/home-improvement-chain-lowes-ceo-to-retire-shares-rise-idUSKBN1H21JP
